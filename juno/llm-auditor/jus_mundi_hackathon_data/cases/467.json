The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by:\n\n**Ms Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1**, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\n**Mr Mark A Clodfelter**, Foley Hoag LLP\n\n**Mr David A Pawlak**, David A Pawlak LLC\n\n**Ms Tafadzwa Pasipanodya**, Foley Hoag LLP\n\n**Mr Constantinos Salonidis**, Foley Hoag LLP.\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nBy **Notice of Arbitration** and **Statement of Claim** dated 23 November 2009, Euram Bank commenced arbitration proceedings against the Slovak Republic, pursuant to Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 15 December 1976 (\" **UNCITRAL Rules** \") and Article 8(2) of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated 15 October 1990 (the \" **BIT** \").\n\n4.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant appointed the Hon. Charles N. Brower as the first arbitrator. By letter dated 8 December 2009, the Respondent challenged the Claimant's appointment of Judge Brower. The Claimant accepted the challenge and, by letter dated 15 December 2009, appointed Dr Dr Alexander Petsche as the first arbitrator. By letter dated 14 January 2010, the Respondent notified the Claimant of its appointment of Professor Brigitte Stern as the second arbitrator. The Claimant submitted a challenge to Professor Stern's appointment pursuant to Article 13(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules in a letter dated 28 January 2010. By letter dated 2 February 2010, Professor Stern submitted her comments and affirmed that she was committed to the \"deontological requirements for an arbitrator.\"\n\n5.\n\nIn a letter dated 15 February 2010, the Claimant proposed to the Respondent the designation of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\" **PCA** \") as Appointing Authority in this case. The Respondent agreed, by letter of 19 February 2010, that the PCA should act as the Appointing Authority. By letter dated 26 February 2010, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the PCA sustain the Claimant's challenge of Professor Stern. By letter to the Parties dated 8 March 2010, the Secretary-General of the PCA set out a schedule of submissions whereby the Respondent would provide a response to the Claimant's request by 15 March 2010 and Professor Stern would be able to submit comments by 22 March 2010.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 15 March 2010, the Respondent submitted its response on the challenge to its party-appointed arbitrator, requesting that the challenge be denied. By letter dated 21 March 2010, Professor Stern reiterated her views that she is a \"dedicated and scrupulous arbitrator.\" By letter dated 29 March 2010, the Claimant submitted its rebuttal to the Respondent's response. By letter dated 5 April 2010, the Respondent submitted its comments to the Claimant's rebuttal and requested a reasoned decision by the Appointing Authority. On 12 April 2010, the Secretary-General of the PCA rejected the challenge to Professor Stern in a reasoned decision.\n\n7.\n\nBy letters dated 25 May 2010 and 8 June 2010, respectively, the Parties agreed to have the Secretary-General of the PCA appoint the presiding arbitrator. On 13 July 2010, the Secretary-General of the PCA appointed, pursuant to the list-procedure foreseen under Article 6(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, Sir Christopher Greenwood as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 September 2010, the Tribunal held a Preliminary Procedural Meeting at the Peace Palace, The Hague, the Netherlands. Present at the meeting were:\n\n**The Tribunal** :\n\nSir Christopher Greenwood\n\nProfessor Brigitte Stern\n\nDr Dr Alexander Petsche\n\n**For the Claimant** :\n\nDr Erhard B\u00f6hm\n\n**For the Respondent** :\n\nMr Radovan Hronsky, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\nMr Tomas Jucha, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\nMr Mark Clodfelter\n\nMr David Pawlak\n\n**For the Permanent Court of Arbitration** :\n\nMr Martin Doe\n\nMs Sarah Melikian.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 September 2010, in the course of the Preliminary Procedural Meeting, the Parties and the Tribunal signed the **Terms of Appointment** providing, *inter alia*, confirmation of the appointment of the members of the Tribunal, stating that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules would be the applicable procedural rules, and that the PCA would serve as Registry for the proceedings. The Terms of Appointment also detailed the procedure for communications and provided information regarding the initial and supplementary deposits as well as the Tribunal's fees and expenses.\n\n10.\n\nOn 27 September 2010, taking into account the agreements reached between the Parties and the Tribunal on procedural issues during the 21 September 2010 hearing, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1** providing, *inter alia*, that the seat of the arbitration would be Stockholm and that the language of the arbitration would be English. Procedural Order No. 1 also made provision for the written submissions, communications, filings, document production, witnesses, experts, hearings, and confidentiality. In addition, Procedural Order No. 1 made the following provisions regarding the schedule of proceedings:\n\n**9.**  **SCHEDULE OF PROCEEDINGS**\n\n9.1. In accordance with the agreement of the Parties, the following schedule shall apply.\n\n9.2. The Respondent shall lodge its Statement of Defence (including any jurisdictional objections) by 5 November 2010.\n\n9.3. Notice has been given that jurisdictional objections may be made and there may be a request for bifurcation. In the event that bifurcation is agreed between the parties or ordered by the Tribunal, a potential schedule envisaged by the Tribunal is attached as an Annex to this order.\n\n**Annex to Procedural Order No. 1 Proposed Schedule in the Event of Bifurcation**\n\nA1.1 Following the submission of Respondent's Statement of Defence on 5 November 2010, the following schedule is proposed in the event of bifurcation.\n\nA1.2 Within 84 days of an agreement or order on bifurcation, Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction shall be submitted together with all evidence (documents, as well as witness statements and expert statements, if any) upon which Respondent wishes to rely, in accordance with the sections on evidence above.\n\nA1.3 Within 84 days of Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction shall be submitted together with all evidence (documents, as well as witness statements and expert statements, if any) upon which Claimants wish to rely, in accordance with the sections on evidence above.\n\nA1.4 Within 30 days of Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Respondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction shall be submitted together with all evidence (documents, as well as witness statements and expert statements if any) upon which Respondent wishes to rely, in accordance with the sections on evidence above.\n\nA1.5 Within 30 days of Respondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction shall be submitted together with all evidence (documents, as well as witness statements and expert statements, if any) upon which Claimants wish to rely, in accordance with the sections on evidence above.\n\nA1.6 On 24 and 25 August 2011, and extending through 26 August 2011 if necessary, a Hearing on Jurisdiction shall be held.\n\nA1.7 As soon as possible after the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal will decide on how it will address the question of jurisdiction and inform the Parties by order, award, or otherwise.\n\n11.\n\nOn 5 November 2010, in accordance with the timetable set out in the annex to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence and Request for Bifurcation.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 10 November 2010, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit any comments regarding the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation by 18 November 2010. By letter dated 16 November 2010, the Claimant requested additional time to submit comments, and by letter dated 30 November 2010, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal indicating that it agreed to the bifurcation of the proceedings into a jurisdictional phase and a merits phase.\n\n13.\n\nOn 2 December 2010, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2**, which detailed the deadlines for the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding as follows:\n\n1. The Tribunal notes that, on 5 November 2010, the Respondent filed an objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, together with a request for bifurcation of the proceedings and that, on 30 November 2010, the Claimant sent to the Tribunal a letter accepting the request for bifurcation.\n\n2. In the light of Section 9 of Procedural Order No. 1, and in view of the Claimant's letter of 30 November 2010, the Tribunal concludes that the Parties have agreed that the proceedings should be bifurcated and that issues of jurisdiction should be addressed in the first phase of the proceedings (hereinafter the \"jurisdictional phase\").\n\n3. Accordingly, the Tribunal, taking account of the Annex to Procedural Order No. 1 and treating the time limits set out in that Annex as being calculated from 30 November 2010, determines that the schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings shall be as follows:\n\n**22 February 2011** : The Respondent shall file its Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with all evidence upon which the Respondent wishes to rely in relation to the issues to be considered in the jurisdictional phase.\n\n**17 May 2011** : The Claimant shall file its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with all evidence upon which the Claimant wishes to rely in relation to the issues to be considered in the jurisdictional phase.\n\n**16 June 2011** : The Respondent shall file its Reply on Jurisdiction, together with all additional evidence (if any) upon which the Respondent wishes to rely in relation to the issues to be considered in the jurisdictional phase.\n\n**18 July 2011:** The Claimant shall file its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, together with all additional evidence (if any) upon which the Claimant wishes to rely in relation to the issues to be considered in the jurisdictional phase.\n\n**24 and 25 August 2011** (extending through 26 August 2011 if necessary): Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nOn 22 February 2011, the Respondent submitted, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, its Memorial on Jurisdiction and accompanying documents.\n\n15.\n\nOn 14 May 2011, the Claimant submitted, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and accompanying documents.\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 June 2011, the Respondent submitted, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, its Reply on Jurisdiction and accompanying documents.\n\n17.\n\nOn 12 July 2011, the Claimant submitted a second challenge to Professor Stern pursuant to Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules. By letter dated 23 July 2011, the Secretary-General of the PCA set out a schedule for submissions on the challenge, with Professor Stern invited to submit comments on the Parties' submission by 29 July 2011, the Claimant being invited to submit any further comments by 5 August 2011, and the Respondent being invited to submit any further comments it may have on the challenge by 12 August 2011.\n\n18.\n\nOn 12 July 2011, the Claimant also submitted a request to the Tribunal to invite the Republic of Austria to submit an *amicus curiae* brief on the effect of the Respondent's accession to the EU on the Treaty in the case at hand. The Claimant indicated its agreement that, if the Republic of Austria were invited to intervene as *amicus curiae*, the EU Commission be invited to do the same if the Respondent requested it or if the Tribunal wished to extend such an invitation.\n\n19.\n\nOn 18 July 2011, the Claimant submitted, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and accompanying documents.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 4 August 2011, the Respondent requested the postponement of the jurisdictional hearing scheduled for 24-26 August 2011. By letter dated 8 August 2011, the Claimant requested that the hearing proceed as planned. By letter dated 10 August 2011, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that the hearing would be postponed.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 August 2011, the Secretary-General of the PCA rejected the challenge to Professor Stern.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 25 August 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Hearing on Jurisdiction had been rescheduled for 19-20 December 2011.\n\n23.\n\nBy letters dated 30 August 2011 and 31 August 2011, the Parties set forth their agreement that they would agree on excerpts of their written submissions to be provided to the prospective *amici curiae*.\n\n24.\n\nOn 2 September 2011, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3** setting forth the Tribunal's invitation to Austria, the Czech Republic and the European Commission to file written *amicus curiae* submissions on the issue of whether the Treaty continues to be in force and the effect, if any, which it possesses (hereinafter the \" **Intra-EU BIT Issue** \"). Procedural Order No. 3 further set forth an amended schedule for the jurisdictional phase of proceedings.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 6 September 2011, the Tribunal invited Austria, the Czech Republic and the European Commission to file *amicus curiae* briefs. On 9 September 2011, the PCA provided the *amici curiae* with the Parties' agreed redacted submissions as well as two alternative translations of the Treaty.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 13 October 2011, the European Commission submitted its observations on the Intra-EU BIT Issue.\n\n27.\n\nOn 20 October 2011, the Republic of Austria submitted its observations on the IntraEU BIT Issue.\n\n28.\n\nOn 1 November 2011, the Czech Republic submitted its observations on the Intra-EU BIT Issue.\n\n29.\n\nOn 30 November 2011, the Parties submitted their comments on the *amici curiae* submissions.\n\n30.\n\nOn 19 and 20 December 2011, the Tribunal held a Hearing on Jurisdiction at the Peace Palace, The Hague, the Netherlands. Present at the meeting were:\n\n**The Tribunal** :\n\nSir Christopher Greenwood\n\nProfessor Brigitte Stern\n\nDr Dr Alexander Petsche\n\n**For the Claimant** :\n\nMr Viktor Popovic, CEO, European American Investment Bank AG\n\nDr Erhard B\u00f6hm\n\nMag. Magda Svoboda-Mascher\n\nMag. Amelie Starlinger\n\nMr Stanislav Durica\n\nMs Martina Novylsedlakova\n\n**For the Respondent** :\n\nMs Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\nMr Miroslav Kabat, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\nMr Mark Clodfelter\n\nMr David Pawlak\n\nMr Constantinos Salonidis\n\nMs Tafadzwa Pasipanodya\n\n**For the Permanent Court of Arbitration** :\n\nMr Martin Doe\n\nMs Hinda Rabkin.\n\n31.\n\nBy letters dated 27 January 2012, the Parties submitted their respective positions on the issue of the translation of the Treaty.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated 3 April 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of two developments since the Hearing on Jurisdiction, namely the filing of the National Council of the Slovak Republic's Reply in the First District Court of Bratislava and the commencement of the EU Pilot case against the Slovak Republic regarding the Austria-CFSR BIT.1\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6102 *et seq.*, below.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 4 April 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Slovak Republic's challenge of the *Eureko B.V. v. The Slovak Republic* award in the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt (\" **Frankfurt Court** \").2\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6248 *et seq.*, below.\n\n34.\n\nBy letters dated 13 April 2012, the Parties submitted further comments on the matters raised in the Parties' letters dated 3 April 2012 and 4 April 2012.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter dated 21 May 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the decision by the Frankfurt Court to dismiss the Slovak Republic's setting aside application of the *Eureko B.V. v. The Slovak Republic* award (\" **Frankfurt Court Decision** \").3\n\nOLG Frankfurt am Main, Beschluss vom 10.5.2012, AZ: 26 SchH 11/10 (hereinafter \"Frankfurt Court Decision\"). *See* \u00b6\u00b6248 *et seq.*, below *.*\n\n36.\n\nOn 26 May 2012, the Respondent submitted a Supplementary Statement of Defence, raising further jurisdictional objections.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter dated 28 May 2012, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence as untimely.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter dated 30 May 2012, pursuant to the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Frankfurt Court Decision.\n\n39.\n\nOn 8 June 2012, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 4**, deciding that it would defer any consideration of the jurisdictional objections contained in the Respondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence until after it had rendered an award on the original jurisdictional objections. The present award is, therefore, without prejudice to the admissibility or the merits of the objections referred to in the Respondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence.\n\n**C. THE PROVISIONS OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe BIT under which the present proceedings have been brought was concluded on 15 October 1990 between the Federal Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. It entered into force on 1 October 1991. The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic was dissolved and Slovakia became an independent State on 1 January 1993. The Parties agree that the BIT became binding on the Slovak Republic by succession. The Respondent maintains that the BIT became binding on the Slovak Republic with effect from 1 January 1995.4\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b633.\n\n41.\n\nThe BIT is authentic in Czech and German. The Czech and German texts are attached to the Award as Annexes 1 and 2, respectively. The English translation published in the *United Nations Treaty Series* (\" **UNTS** \") is attached as Annex 3 and the translation on which the Claimant initially relied (which was attached to its pleadings as Attachment C1), which is closely based upon the UNTS version, is attached as Annex 4. The Respondent submitted its own translations into English from the Czech and German texts (Exhibits RL-40A and RL-40B) which are attached as Annexes 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, after the conclusion of the oral proceedings, the Claimant submitted a new translation into English which appears at Annex 7. The Tribunal addresses the differences between the Parties regarding the translations in Chapter III of this Award.\n\n42.\n\nArticle 1 of the BIT defines the terms \"investment\", \"investor\" and \"earnings\". The extent of the definitions is considered in Chapter IV of the Award. Article 2 provides, *inter alia*, that each Party shall accord fair and equitable treatment to investments made in its territory by investors of the other Party and that such investments and the earnings which they generate shall have the full protection of the BIT. Article 3 is a mostfavoured-nation clause, the scope of which will be considered in Chapter V(C) of the Award. Article 4, which is entitled \"Compensation\" provides for compensation to a qualifying investor in the event of expropriation, nationalization or similar measures. Its scope, and relationship to other provisions in the BIT, is considered in detail in Chapter V(A) of the Award. Article 5 requires each Party to guarantee to investors of the other Party the free transfer, without delay, of payments, including earnings, in connection with an investment. Article 8 provides for arbitration between a Party to the BIT and an investor of the other Party, at the investor's request, of certain disputes regarding Articles 4 and 5 of the BIT. As such, it is Article 8 which is the source of any jurisdiction which the Tribunal may possess. Its scope is keenly contested between the Parties and is discussed in detail in Chapter V(A) of the Award.\n\n**D. Statement of Facts**\n-------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe subject matter of the dispute concerns the Claimant\u2019s interest in Chemick\u00e1 zdravotn\u00e1 pois\u0165ov\u0148a Apollo (hereinafter **\"Apollo\"),** a health insurance company organised under the laws of the Slovak Republic. The following section sets out the Parties\u2019 submissions regarding the facts insofar as these are relevant to the issues before the Tribunal in the current phase of the proceedings.\n\n44.\n\nApollo was founded in 1994 as a public health insurance provider and was converted from a statutory health insurance company to a private joint stock company in 2005 after the Slovak Republic adopted reforms to the health insurance company regulations of 2004.5\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b611-12. Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b630-36.\n\n45.\n\nOn 19 December 2006, the Claimant\u2019s Slovak subsidiary, E1C a.s. **(\"EIC\"),** purchased a 5 1% shareholding in Apollo. [BLANK]6[BLANK]7[BLANK]8 EIC\u2019s proposed acquisition of Apollo required the approval of the Health Care Supervision Office and the Slovak Anti-Monopoly Office **(\"AMO\").** According to the Respondent, EIC represented to the AMO that it was acting independently of the Claimant and that the Claimant did not perform any activities in the Slovak Republic. The AMO approved the transaction on 16 April 2007, noting that \"on the basis of ownership of the shares representing 100% interest in the registered capital, the entrepreneur E.I.C. is exclusively controlled by the entrepreneur European American Investment Bank.\"9\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b641. *See* also Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b613.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction. \u00b613. *See* also Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b645-46.\n\nEIC Registration on the Slovak Ministry of Justice Business Register (R-12)\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. \u00b6\u00b642-43.\n\n46.\n\nIn 2006, there was a general election in the Slovak Republic, as a result of which a new government came to power. On 24 November 2007, the National Council of the Slovak Republic adopted Act No. 530/2007 Coll. **(\"Amendment I\"),** which amended the 2004 law on health insurance companies. A second Amendment, Act No. 594/2007 Coll. **(\"Amendment II\"),** was adopted on 19 December 2007. Amendments I and II entered into force on 1 January 2008. These Amendments prohibited Slovak public health insurance providers from distributing as dividends profits derived from public health insurance and required them to reinvest all such profits in the provision of public health care. EIC sold its shareholding in Apollo in May 2008. [BLANK]10\n\nStatement of Defence. \u00b638.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the effect of the Amendments was to destroy the value of its investment, because Apollo was no longer able to remit profits to EIC, and that the Amendments therefore amounted to expropriation, or a measure similar to expropriation, within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT, as well as violating the requirement of fair and equitable treatment in Article 2 of the BIT and the provisions of Article 5 of the BIT regarding transfers. It estimates that the value of its investment in Apollo as at 23 November 2007 (i.e. the day before the promulgation of the Amendments) was EUR 131,400,000.11 The Claimant seeks an award of not less than EUR 131,400,000, together with interest and costs.12 The Respondent denies that the Amendments amounted to expropriation or a measure similar to expropriation and that they were contrary to Articles 2 and 5 of the BIT.13\n\nStatement of Claim. \u00b634.\n\nIbid,. \u00b646.\n\nStatement of Defence. \u00b6\u00b658-71.\n\n**E. The Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent raises four objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal:\n\n(1) *(the intra-EU BIT objection)* that the arbitration provision of the BIT is no longer applicable, because the Respondent and Austria are both Member States of the European Union **(\"EU\").** The Respondent puts this argument in three different ways. First, it maintains that, under international law. the BIT must be considered to have been terminated when the Slovak Republic joined the EU in 2003, because the EU treaties (collectively referred to in the Award as the **\"ECT\")** and the BIT deal with the same subject-matter and their provisions are incompatible. Secondly, the Respondent contends that, even if the BIT was not terminated when Slovakia joined the EU, the arbitration provision in Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with the EU treaties and therefore inapplicable under international law. Thirdly, the Respondent advances the argument that, as a matter of EU law, which forms part of the *lex arbitri*, Article 8 of the BIT can no longer be applied;\n\n(2) (*the indirect investment objection*) that, in any event, the claims do not arise out of a qualifying investment, because it was not the Claimant which owned shares in Apollo but its subsidiary, EIC, a company incorporated in the Slovak Republic;\n\n(3) (*the Article 8 objection)* that the Claimant's claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT fall outside the scope of the arbitration provisions in Article 8, since Article 8 provides for investor-State arbitration only in respect of disputes regarding Article 5 of the BIT and disputes regarding the amount, or arrangements for payment, of compensation in respect of Article 4 and do not confer upon the Tribunal jurisdiction to determine whether or not there has been an expropriation or similar measure within Article 4 or whether such a measure was unlawful;\n\n(4) (*the procedural objection*) in relation to the claims for alleged breach of Article 2 of the BIT, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant did not comply with the requirement to provide a pre-arbitration notice sufficiently specifying the claims or with the requirement to attempt to negotiate a settlement and that compliance with these conditions is a prerequisite to the establishment of jurisdiction.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal should dismiss all four objections:\n\n(1) with regard to the *intra-EU BIT objection*, the Claimant denies that either the BIT as a whole or the arbitration provisions in Article 8 is incompatible with the EU treaties;\n\n(2) with regard to the *indirect investment objection*, the Claimant contends that the BIT protects the investments of investors of one State Party in the territory of the other State Party irrespective of whether the investment is made through a locally incorporated subsidiary;\n\n(3) with regard to the *Article 8 objection*, the Claimant denies that the provision restricts the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the manner suggested by the Respondent with regard to a claim under Article 4 of the BIT but argues that, even if it does, the question whether or not the Amendments were unlawful has already been decided by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic. Moreover, the Claimant argues that the provisions of Article 8 have to be read in the light of Article 3(1) of the BIT (the \" **MFN clause** \") which requires the Respondent to accord the Claimant treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investors of third States and contends that the Slovak Republic is party to a number of bilateral investment treaties which accord investors a right to bring arbitration proceedings in respect of alleged unfair and inequitable treatment and in respect of all aspects of alleged expropriation or similar measures;\n\n(4) with regard to the *procedural objection*, the Claimant denies that compliance with the procedural requirements relied on by the Respondent is a condition for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and maintains that it has, in any event, complied with those requirements.\n\n50.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that if the Respondent succeeds on either the *intra-EU BIT objection* or the *indirect investment objection*, the result will be to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction in respect of all the claims. If the Respondent succeeds on its *Article 8 objection,* the Tribunal will be deprived of jurisdiction in respect of the claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT but its jurisdiction to address the claims under Article 5 of the BIT will be unaffected. The *procedural objection* applies only to the claims for alleged breach of Article 2 of the BIT.\n\n**F. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n-----------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal enter an award:\n\n*i.* in favour of the Slovak Republic and against the Claimant, dismissing the Claimant's claims for lack of jurisdiction in their entirety and with prejudice;\n\n*ii.* pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, ordering that the Claimant bear all the costs of the arbitration, including the Respondent's costs for legal representation and assistance.14\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6306; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6581.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal enter an award:\n\n*i.* in favour of the Claimant and against the Respondent, assuming jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims and dismissing the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction;\n\n*ii.* that, pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Respondent bear all the costs of this arbitration, including the Claimant's costs for legal representation and assistance.15\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6444; Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6322.\n\n**G. THE STRUCTURE OF THE AWARD**\n---------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Award is structured as follows.\n\n*Chapter II* deals with the three variants of the Respondent's *intra-EU BIT objection*.\n\n*Chapter III* considers the differences between the Parties regarding the proper translation of the Treaty into English.\n\n*Chapter IV* deals with the *indirect investment objection*.\n\n*Chapter V* deals with the *Article 8 objection.* Section A deals with the meaning of Article 8 of the BIT; Section B considers the Claimant's argument that the Slovak Constitutional Court has already decided that the Amendments were an unlawful interference with property rights; Section C examines the Claimant's argument based upon the MFN provision in Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n*Chapter VI* considers the *procedural objection.*\n\n*Chapter VII* addresses the question of costs.\n\n*Chapter VIII* sets out the Tribunal's conclusions and the Order regarding the jurisdictional objections.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered carefully the submissions made by the Parties, as well as the observations of the Government of Austria, the Government of the Czech Republic and the European Commission, all of which were helpful and for which the Tribunal thanks their respective authors. All of the points made in those submissions have been fully taken into account by the Tribunal even if the Tribunal does not repeat them in its reasoning. In its Award, the Tribunal addresses what it considers to be the factors which are determinative of each of the issues which it is required to decide.\n\n**II. FIRST OBJECTION: THE INTRA-EU BIT ISSUE**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent's intra-EU BIT objection has three separate strands.\n\n56.\n\nFirst, the Respondent considers that the BIT as a whole is not applicable by virtue of the principle stated in Article 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969 (\" **VCLT** \"), having been terminated by the accession of Slovakia to the European Union in 2004, since it considers that the ECT, to which Slovakia became party on accession, is incompatible with the BIT.16 Article 59 VCLT provides, in relevant part as follows:\n\n*Article 59*\n\n*Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty*\n\n1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:\n\n(*a*) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or\n\n(*b*) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\n\n2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intention of the parties.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, Section III; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, Section III.\n\n57.\n\nSecondly, even if the BIT as a whole has not been terminated, the Respondent maintains that Article 8 cannot be applied, by virtue of the principle in Article 30(3) of the VCLT, as it considers Article 8 to be incompatible with EU law.17 Article 30 of the VCLT provides as follows:\n\n*Article 30*\n\n*Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter*\n\n1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6186-190; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6216-220.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent summarises these two ways of putting its case in the Memorial on Jurisdiction:\n\n*First*, the Treaty ceased to be available as a basis for the arbitration of BIT claims because under international law it must be considered to have been terminated by the treaty granting Slovakia membership in the EU, or, alternatively, because the Treaty's investor-State arbitration clause became inoperative due to its incompatibility with EU law.18\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b66.\n\n59.\n\nThirdly, independently of the application of the VCLT, the Respondent argues that this pre-eminence of EU law has to apply in any case, because EU law, as part of Swedish law, is part of the *lex arbitri* of this UNCITRAL arbitration (Section E) and thereby renders Article 8 of the BIT inapplicable.19\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6191-195; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b641-61.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 8 of the BIT, and the BIT as a whole, are unaffected by Slovakia's accession to the European Union.20 In support of its argument, the Claimant discusses Articles 30, 59 and 65 of the VCLT. It also refers, in particular, to the awards of the tribunals in *Eureko B.V. v. Slovak Republic*21 and *Eastern Sugar B.V.* *v. Czech Republic,*22 in which, it maintains, the precise arguments now advanced by the Respondent have already been rejected.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b676-110.\n\n*Eureko B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, PCA Case No. 2008-13 (Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010) (RL-156) (hereinafter \" *Eureko* \").\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V. v. Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 088/2004 (Partial Award, 27 March 2007) (RL-148) (hereinafter \" *Eastern Sugar* \").\n\n61.\n\nIn its *amicus curiae* brief, submitted pursuant to the invitation of the Tribunal,23 the European Commission maintains that the BIT deals with \"subject matters that *fall squarely* within the scope of the [ECT], specifically the rules on foreign investment activity including post-establishment treatment and operation\"24 and is incompatible with the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality in EU law. It maintains that EU law takes precedence over any conflicting provisions of a treaty between EU Member States and notes that a private party cannot rely on such a treaty to take advantage of dispute settlement mechanisms that conflict with EU law.25 The *amicus curiae* brief submitted by the Czech Republic also contends that the BITs which it concluded with other EU Member States have been rendered obsolete on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU and that, in accordance with Articles 59 and 30(3) of the VCLT, Article 8 of the BIT should be regarded as having been terminated.26 By contrast, the Republic of Austria considers that the BIT is still in force and endorses the reasoning of the tribunals in *Eureko* and *Eastern Sugar*, concluding that the BIT and the ECT do not deal with the same subject-matter.27\n\n*See* \u00b625, above.\n\nObservations of the European Commission, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 4.\n\nObservations of the Czech Republic, \u00b6\u00b613-23.\n\nObservations of the Republic of Austria, pp. 2-6.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider each of the three variations of the intra-EU BIT objection in turn. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to consider the threshold question of whether the VCLT is applicable to the relation between the BIT and the ECT.\n\n**B. WHETHER THE VCLT IS APPLICABLE**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Positions of the Parties***\n-------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe initial position of the Respondent was that the VCLT, as a treaty to which the Slovak Republic succeeded in 1993, is applicable to the relationship between the BIT and the ECT.28 For the Respondent, the ECT forms part of international law, so that it is international law which must determine the relationship of the ECT with all the other treaties to which the Slovak Republic is party, including the BIT.29 Without taking a clear theoretical position on the applicability of the VCLT in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent in practice analysed the relationship between the BIT and the ECT by reference to Articles 59 and 30(3) of the VCLT.30\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b637.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b639, 42.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b639.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimant responds that the ECT is not an ordinary treaty and that EU law should not be regarded as part of international law but rather as a body of law which forms part of the law of each Member State. In the Claimant's view, \"European Union law is not part of ordinary international law\"31, so that the VCLT is not applicable to the relationship of the ECT with international treaties such as the BIT. In other words, \"this special legal character of EU law \u2013 as being domestic, rather than international law, leads to the conclusion that neither Article 30 nor Article 59 VCLT are applicable in the present case.\"32\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6101.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant also advances a separate argument that, if the VCLT is applicable to the relationship between the BIT and the ECT, and if the two agreements are indeed incompatible, the BIT should not be regarded as having been terminated, because the Slovak Republic has not followed the procedure for termination required by Article 65 of the VCLT. Article 65 of the VCLT provides as follows:\n\n*Article 65*\n\n*Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a treaty*\n\n1. A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention, invokes either a defect in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a ground for impeaching the validity of a treaty, terminating it, withdrawing from it or suspending its operation, must notify the other parties of its claim. The notification shall indicate the measure proposed to be taken with respect to the treaty and the reasons therefor.\n\n2. If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special urgency, shall not be less than three months after the receipt of the notification, no party has raised any objection, the party making the notification may carry out in the manner provided in article 67 the measure which it has proposed.\n\n3. If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the parties shall seek a solution through the means indicated in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n4. Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall affect the rights or obligations of the parties under any provisions in force binding the parties with regard to the settlement of disputes.\n\n5. Without prejudice to article 45, the fact that a State has not previously made the notification prescribed in paragraph 1 shall not prevent it from making such notification in answer to another party claiming performance of the treaty or alleging its violation.\n\n66.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent maintains that the VCLT, as such, is not applicable, because Article 4 of the VCLT provides that the VCLT is applicable only to treaties concluded by States after the VCLT became applicable to them. The Respondent contends that the VCLT entered into force for it in 1993, whereas it must be deemed to have concluded the BIT in 1990 or 1991. Nevertheless, according to the Respondent, Articles 59 and 30(3) of the VCLT state rules of customary international law which are applicable even though the VCLT, *qua* treaty, is not. It argues, however, that the provisions of Article 65 of the VCLT did not reflect customary international law and were, therefore, inapplicable with regard to the present case.\n\n67.\n\nAs an answer to this new argument on the part of the Respondent, the Claimant maintains, in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, that the BIT cannot be regarded as having been concluded by Slovakia until it became binding upon Slovakia in 1995. It was therefore concluded subsequent to the VCLT and the VCLT is applicable in its entirety.33\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b618-25.\n\n***2. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine the general issue of the applicability of the VCLT to the relationship between an intra-EU BIT and the ECT, as well as the law flowing from the ECT, and will then deal separately with the issue of the applicability or nonapplicability of the VCLT to the particular BIT in this case in light of the State succession that followed the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.\n\n***(1) Application of the VCLT to the relations between the EU treaties and intra-EU BITs***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by stating that, in its opinion, EU law is part of international law, even if, at the same time, it is also part of the internal legal order of each EU Member State. This dual nature of EU law has already been underscored by the *AES* tribunal, which stated:\n\nRegarding the Community competition law regime, it has a dual nature: on the one hand, it is an international law regime, on the other hand, once introduced in the national legal orders, it is part of these legal orders.34\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22 (Award, 23 September 2010), \u00b67.6.6 (hereinafter \" *AES v. Hungary* \").\n\n70.\n\nEU law is international law, first and foremost because it is based upon an international treaty, the ECT. It was for that reason that the European Court of Justice (the \" **ECJ** \") stated, in the famous and often cited case *Van Gend en Loos,* that\n\nThe Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights...35\n\nCase 26/62, *NV Algemene Transporten Expeditie Onderneming van Gend & Loos v. Netherlands Internal Revenue Administration*, [1963] ECR 1 (RL-94), Section B (hereinafter \" *van Gend & Loos* \").\n\n71.\n\nIt is the Tribunal's view that EU law is a subsystem of public international law. The fact that EU law has some special features \u2013 like the direct effect of some of its decisions in the national legal orders of its Member States \u2013 and forms part of national law does not render this corpus of rules completely different from international law, which is also incorporated \u2013 whether automatically in monist countries or through the requisite constitutional procedure in dualist countries \u2013 into national legal orders.\n\n72.\n\nThe tribunal in the *Eureko* case, applying a Slovak BIT similar to the one at issue here, has also recognised that EU law is part of international law:\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the proper framework for its analysis of these arguments is, in the first place, the framework applicable to the legal instrument from which the Tribunal derives its *prima facie* jurisdiction. Just as the Court of Justice of the European Communities has held that its own perspective is dictated by the treaties that established it, so the perspective of this Tribunal must begin with the instrument by which and the legal order within which consent originated, *i.e*., the first stage described above. That framework is the BIT and *international law, including applicable EU law*.36\n\n*Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6228 (emphasis added).\n\n73.\n\nSince EU law has to be analysed as a system of international law and the ECT as a treaty governed by international law, its relationship with the BIT is itself a matter governed by the relevant rules of public international law. The Tribunal must, therefore, ascertain the content of those rules.\n\n74.\n\nIt is clear that the BIT and the ECT are both treaties within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a) of the VCLT, so that their respective interpretation and interaction is potentially governed by the provisions of the VCLT, and subsidiarily by any other applicable rule of international law.\n\n75.\n\nThe same conclusion regarding the applicability of the VCLT was adopted by the tribunal in the *Eastern Sugar* case, applying a BIT similar to the one at issue here:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that in the absence of more specific legal provisions, the effect of the Czech Republic accession to the European Union, a regional multilateral treaty, on the BIT must be judged by the law of Nations, and in particular the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties dated 1969.37\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6156.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion, therefore, is that the VCLT is in principle applicable to the relationship between the BIT and the ECT. The Tribunal will accordingly examine whether the application of the VCLT is barred by the non-retroactivity provision in its Article 4.\n\n***(2) Whether the BIT was concluded before or after Slovakia became party to the VCLT***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe starting point of the new argument presented by the Respondent in its Reply is the principle stated in Article 4 of the VCLT, which provides that the Convention \"applies only to treaties which are concluded by States after the entry into force of the present Convention with regard to such States.\" The Respondent argues that \"concluded\" in this provision means \"ratified\", rather than \"entered into force\"; the Respondent then argues that, because of the rules on State succession, the VCLT does not apply to the situation dealt with by the Tribunal:\n\nThe Treaty was concluded on October 15, 1990 and entered into force in the relations of Austria and Czechoslovakia on October 1, 1991. The Slovak Republic emerged as a successor sovereign State on January 1, 1993. The applicability of the Treaty by way of state succession was confirmed by an exchange of diplomatic notes on 4 August and 25 November 1994, entering into force on January 1, 1995.\n\nOn the other hand, by way of a declaration of succession filed with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on May 19, 1993, Slovakia is bound by the provisions of the VCLT as of January 1, 1993. In light of Article 4 VCLT, this would mean that the provisions of the Vienna Convention apply only to treaties which are concluded by Slovakia and other States parties to the Convention after January 1, 1993.38\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b681-82.\n\n78.\n\nAlthough the Respondent's precise argument is not entirely clear, it appears that the latter must have relied on the date of the initial \"conclusion\" or *initial ratification* of the BIT by Czechoslovakia in 1990 and not its entry into force for Slovakia in 1995.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to address the question of whether a treaty can be said to be concluded, within the meaning of this term in Article 4 of the VCLT, when it is ratified or only when it enters into force, as both the exchange of diplomatic notes in the framework of the process of State succession \u2013 which can be considered as equivalent to a ratification by the successor State \u2013 and the entry into force of the BIT for Slovakia, took place after Slovakia became bound by the VCLT. Indeed, once Slovakia became an independent successor State, it could not be bound by the BIT, notwithstanding the fact that its predecessor State had signed and ratified the BIT, until it had taken the steps necessary to succeed to the BIT. Only once it had taken those steps could it be regarded as having concluded the BIT. In the present case, Slovakia did not take those steps until after it had become bound by the VCLT.\n\n80.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by information given by Austria in its submission, which explains that, as regards the BIT an Exchange of Diplomatic Notes took place in 1994, and the BIT entered into force between Austria and the Slovak Republic in 1995, after the entry into force of the VCLT:\n\nThe Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments was signed on 15 October 1990 and entered into force on 1 October 1991 (\u2026). Following the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, Austria and the newly independent Slovakia jointly identified the BIT, among other treaties, to be in force and applicable between them by means of an Exchange of Diplomatic Notes (See Federal Law Gazette No. 1046/1994). Moreover, the Exchange of Diplomatic Notes also amended the BIT, so as to insert the designations \"Slovak Republic\" and \"Slovak\" into the text of the Agreement as appropriate.39\n\nObservations of the Republic of Austria, p. 1.\n\n81.\n\nIn other words, the BIT would not have become applicable between Austria and the Respondent had it not been for the Exchange of Notes. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the BIT cannot be considered to have been concluded by the Respondent until, at the earliest, the date of the Exchange of Notes in 1994. Since the VCLT became applicable to Slovakia on 1 January 1993, it therefore applies to the relations between the BIT and the ECT, the latter treaty having entered into force for Slovakia on 1 May 2004.\n\n**C. THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 59 OF THE VCLT**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the question whether the effect of Article 59(1) of the VCLT is that the BIT was terminated upon the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.\n\n***1. The Positions of the Parties and the Amici Curiae***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Respondent***\n------------------------\n\n83.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there are three conditions for the application of Article 59 of the VCLT: (1) the parties to the earlier and later treaty must coincide; (2) the treaties must relate to the same subject matter, and (3) either (i) the intention of the contracting parties must have been to govern the subject matter of the treaties by the later treaty, or (ii) there must be incompatibility between the provisions of the earlier and the later treaty, which makes it impossible to apply both treaties simultaneously.40 The Respondent argues that the above requirements for the application of Article 59(1) of the VCLT have been met in the case of the BIT and the ECT.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b653.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is beyond dispute that the 2003 Treaty of Accession, by which it became a Member State of the EU and a Party to the ECT, was concluded after the conclusion of the BIT and that both Austria and the Respondent are States Parties to the Treaty of Accession as well as the BIT.41\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b654.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the BIT and the EC Treaty \"relate to the same subject matter.\"42 The Respondent submits, consistent with the International Law Commission Report on Fragmentation of International Law (hereinafter the \" **ILC Report** \"), that the \"criterion of sameness must be considered fulfilled if two *different* rules or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the *same* factual situation.\"43 Contrary to the findings of the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal, and as the *Eureko* tribunal acknowledged, \"[n]othing in Article 59 requires that the two treaties should be *in all respects co-extensive* ; but the later treaty must have more than a minor overlap or incidental overlap with the earlier treaty.\"44 The Respondent submits that \"the fundamental purpose of both treaties is to broaden and strengthen mutual economic relationships, to promote the flow of capital and the economic development of the Parties, while guaranteeing the protection of private parties involved in the process.\"45 The Respondent also advances several specific ways in which the EC Treaty and the BIT relate to a common subject matter, namely that the EC Treaty's protection of an investment made in an EU Member State extends to the \"same circle of entities\", covers the same types of investments, offers the same concrete protections, and provides comparable systems of remedies as the BIT.46\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b655-120; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b693-105.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b655, citing International Law Commission, *Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law*, Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, 13 April 2006, UN Doc.

According to the Respondent, the standard so defined mirrors the protections provided under EU law which go \"far beyond the principle of non-discrimination.\"50 The Respondent points to the ECJ's determination that freedom of establishment under EU law mandates that any obstacles, restrictions or hindrances to the enjoyment of this freedom be removed.51\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6100.\n\n*Ibid.*, citing Case C-255/97, *Pfeiffer Grosshandel GmbH v.

Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6139-144.\n\n93.\n\nAs to the last condition for the application of Article 59(1) of the VCLT, the Respondent argues that, by virtue of the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU, the States Parties to the BIT manifested their intention to have the subject matter of the BIT governed by EU law.59\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6121-136; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6147-152.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent discusses the test for \"intention\", pointing to Article 59(1)(a) of the VCLT, which it argues concerns situations in which a treaty is \"implicitly terminated\" even if the parties have not expressly provided for it.60\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6121.\n\n95.\n\nRelying on the ILC Commentary on the Law of Treaties for the proposition that the intention of the parties is a \"matter of construction of the two treaties\", the Respondent concludes that, because of its later date, the Treaty of Accession is \"key to determining, in its terms and in the circumstances of its conclusion\" the intention of the parties to the BIT as to the BIT's termination or continuation.61 The Respondent argues that \"intent may be discerned in the relative importance and scope of the two treaties,\" and the fact that the earlier treaty contains more specific rules is not preclusive of an implicit termination.62 Furthermore, the ILC Report provides that \"the principle of *lex specialis* may be overridden by treaties of a more general character by virtue of their \u2018relevance' or \u2018importance'.\"63\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6122.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6123.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Parties' intent to supplant the BIT is demonstrated by an overriding commitment to a pervasive internal market and common commercial policy, with the corresponding removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.64 The Respondent also stresses, as proof that bilateral investment treaties are obsolete in the relations of the EU Member States *inter se*, that \"no BIT has been concluded between EU Member States after their accession into the EU.\"65\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6126-132.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6129.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent claims that it has established far more than a minor or incidental overlap between the BIT and the EC Treaty.66\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6133-136.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the incompatibility between the provisions of the ECT and those of the BIT is such that the two treaties cannot be applied at the same time and that therefore, pursuant to Article 59(1) of the VCLT, the BIT must have been terminated by the Respondent's accession to the ECT.67 The Respondent maintains that incompatibility between the provisions of the BIT and EU law must be construed broadly and is established on four grounds: (a) fundamental freedoms may be incompatible with BIT protections; (b) measures by Member States that restrict fundamental freedoms in conformity with EU law may breach BIT protections; (c) competition and regulatory law essential for the functioning of the single European market may conflict with BIT provisions and; (d) the BIT dispute settlement provision infringes the exclusive jurisdiction of the ECJ to interpret EU law.68\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6137-181; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6153-205.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6205.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent discusses the test for \"incompatibility\", relying on the ILC Report, to argue that \"incompatibility may arise \u2026 when a treaty *frustrates* the goals of another treaty *without* there being any incompatibility *stricto sensu* between their respective provisions.\"69\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6138-143, citing ILC Report, *supra* note 43, \u00b624 (emphasis in original).\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent considers a wide range of EU regulatory provisions which restrict compliance with the provisions of the BIT.70 The Respondent submits two particular categories of such EU regulatory provisions: (a) EU legal rules which would prevent a BIT Party from honouring specific guarantees given to the investor,71 and (b) EU legal rules which generally and negatively alter the legal environment in which the investor operates.72 The Respondent therefore argues that the \"application and enforcement\" of EU law could constitute a breach of obligations under the BIT, or that meeting obligations under the BIT could result in a violation of EU law.73\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6145.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6147-149.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6145.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6147-149.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent advances two arguments in support of its position that the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism established in Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law. First, the Respondent argues that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with the ECT provisions on the exclusive jurisdiction of EU judicial institutions pursuant to Article 292 EC Treaty, since the Tribunal may fail properly to take EU law into account.74 Secondly, the Respondent submits that the existence and applicability of Article 8 of the BIT has already breached EC Treaty provisions on non-discrimination under Article 12 of the EC Treaty since it creates preferential treatment not tolerated under EU law by allowing Austrian investors to choose from different enforcement options not available to other EU investors.75\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6153-173.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6174-181; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6171-174.\n\n102.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent highlights the proceedings (the *EU Pilot* case) commenced by the European Commission (\" **EC** \") against the Slovak Republic, wherein the EC expressed serious concerns regarding the compatibility of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT with EU law, as another indication of the incompatibility of the Treaty with EU law.76\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6206-209, discussing Pilot Case 1786/11/MARK (RL-389), p. 2 (hereinafter \" *EU Pilot Case* \").\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent takes note of the *Eureko* tribunal's findings that the uniformity of EU law can be preserved in set aside proceedings in national court based on public policy, pursuant to the ECJ's *Eco Swiss* decision which qualified a violation of EU competition law as a matter of public policy.77 However, the Respondent argues that it is unclear which rules of EU law apart from competition law enjoy the status of public policy, and that the public policy provisions in the New York Convention and the Swedish Arbitration Act (1999), respectively, are narrow in scope and would not provide a safeguard for EU law issues that may arise under Article 8 of the BIT.78\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6165; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6204, Citing Case C-126/97 *Eco Swiss China Time Ltd v. Benetton International NV* [1999] ECR I-3055 (RL-77), \u00b637 (hereinafter \" *Eco Swiss* \").\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6166-172; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6204.\n\n104.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent disputes the argument that the discrimination inherent in the BIT due to its protections being available solely to Austrian or Slovak nationals can be cured by extending the benefit of the BIT to all other EU investors. The Respondent submits that the \"extension doctrine\" cannot be relied upon to \"undo a breach that has already occurred\" and the fact that it only harms potential investors rather than the Claimant is irrelevant since this discrimination establishes incompatibility with EU law, which is relevant for the purposes of Article 59 VCLT.79\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6177-185; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6178-183.\n\n105.\n\nLastly, the Respondent argues that Article 65 of the VCLT, which requires notification in the case of termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty, does not apply to Article 59 of the VCLT.80 Instead, the Respondent asserts that, pursuant to Article 59, \"there is no explicit requirement under the law of treaties for notification in case of termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty by the conclusion of a subsequent treaty.\"81 The Respondent argues that the premise underlying Article 59 of the VCLT is to regulate cases where the conclusion of a later treaty is not clear evidence of the parties' consent to abrogate the earlier treaty.82 The Respondent notes that State practice supports the conclusion that termination pursuant to Article 59 of the VCLT is not subject to the procedural requirements of Article 65 VCLT.83 The Respondent therefore criticises the *Eureko* tribunal's finding that Article 59 VCLT is subject to Article 65 VCLT procedural requirements, calling it a fundamental error.84\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6182-185; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b662-79.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6182-183; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b663.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction \u00b666.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b677-78.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b679.\n\n***(2) The Claimant***\n----------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal should first look at the wording of the BIT itself, instead of turning to extrinsic evidence.85 The Claimant notes that the language of the BIT indicates that the Contracting States foresaw and provided for the possibility that they may enter into international obligations with one another and third parties in the future, citing as evidence Articles 3(2) and 7 of the BIT.86 Article 3(2) of the BIT creates an exception to Most-Favoured Nation treatment for \"present and future privileges accorded by one Contracting Party to the investors of a third State or their investments in connection with: (a) [a]n economic union, tariff union, common market, free trade zone or economic community.\"87 The Claimant argues that these exceptions fit perfectly with Austria's and Slovakia's accession to the EU.88 Article 7 of the BIT stipulates that the BIT will remain in full force and effect unless a more favourable regime takes precedence.89 Thus, the BIT already explicitly provides conflict rules for the case where one or both parties to the BIT join a community such as the EU. In the present case, since accession to the EU did not create a more favourable treatment for investor-State disputes, the Claimant asserts that the BIT remains unaffected by Slovakia's accession to the EU.90\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b627.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b628-29.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b628.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b629.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b631-34.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b627-35.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the preconditions for termination under Article 59 VCLT have not been met. The Claimant submits that there was no intent that the \"matter\" of the BIT should be governed by EU law since it was not addressed in connection with Slovakia's accession to the EU.91 Furthermore, the Claimant alleges that EU law and the Treaty are not incompatible; the Treaty protects already existing investments whereas EU law concentrates on the four freedoms which focus on the preestablishment phase.92 In addition, the Claimant submits that insofar as the Treaty and EU law regulate similar matters, they are parallel, but not contradictory.93\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b695.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b696.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b697; Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b662-74.\n\n108.\n\nRegarding the application of Article 59(1) of the VCLT, the Claimant argues that the provision envisages two possible avenues for implicit termination: (i) the intention to abrogate the earlier treaty appears from the terms of the later treaty or is otherwise established or (ii) the provisions of the later treaty \"are so far incompatible that they are not capable of being applied at the same time.\"94\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b639.\n\n109.\n\nRegarding the first option, the Claimant states that \"[n]owhere does the Accession Treaty say that the Treaty is abrogated and nowhere does it say that the Accession Treaty and EU law \u2018govern the matter' of bilateral investment treaty protection.\"95 As to the second option, the Claimant notes that the incompatibility between the two treaties must be sufficient to demonstrate the intent to completely abrogate the earlier treaty.96 The Claimant argues that termination pursuant to Article 59 of the VCLT requires the treaties to strictly relate to the same subject matter, and that EU law and the BIT do not relate to the same subject matter.97 The Claimant asserts that \"[t]o accede a community is simply not the same as a specific investment protection regime providing for investor-State arbitration.\"98\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b640.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b641.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b641-56.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b644-45.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimant further distinguishes the BIT and EU law: (i) EU law does not provide for any guarantees relating to legal property regimes since the regulation of property is controlled by Member States, (ii) the ECJ does not provide for the protection of fundamental rights, (iii) the aim and purpose of the treaties are different, the BIT dealing only with economic aims and the EU Treaty also addressing political aims, and (iv) the ECJ is not a court set up to protect investors.99 Pointing to the *Eco Swiss* case, the Claimant argues that EU law does not prohibit arbitral tribunals from interpreting EU law; instead, the two \"concepts\" work \"in parallel.\"100\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b645-47, 51.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b652-55, citing *Eco Swiss*, *supra* note 77.\n\n111.\n\nContrary to any intention to terminate or suspend treaties, the Claimant points to Article 6(12) of the *Act Concerning the Conditions of Accession* attached to the Treaty of Accession, which it argues, explicitly contemplates subsequent measures to adjust rights and obligations under prior international agreements rather than their automatic termination or suspension.101\n\n*Act Concerning the Conditions of Accession,* dated 23 September 2003 (RL-5), p. 37.\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the ECJ has ruled that EU Member States \"may conclude bilateral treaties between themselves.\"102 The Claimant distinguishes the two ECJ judgments on BITs which found that these infringed EU law, noting that these were BITs concluded between EU Member States and third countries and are therefore not relevant to the present case.103 Finally, the Claimant points to actions of the Slovak Republic that, according to the Claimant, demonstrate that the Respondent \"did not assume that intra-EU BITs would be ineffective\": (i) neither party denounced the BIT; (ii) a letter from the Respondent stating that the health insurance laws would be in accordance with BITs; (iii) assurances made by the Respondent to the Netherlands regarding the validity of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT; (iv) the Respondent's amendment of its BIT with Romania in light of that country's forthcoming accession to the EU which did not alter the dispute resolution clause, and; (v) the inclusion of the Treaty on the Slovak Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs homepage listing all current BITs.104\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6105-110.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6107, citing Case C-205/06, *Commission v.

Finland* [2009] ECR I-10889 (RL-62).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6108.\n\n113.\n\nTurning to the case law, the Claimant emphasises that the *Eureko* tribunal found that the preconditions for termination under Article 59 of the VCLT were not met since \"the EC Treaty *does not relate to the same subject matter* as the Netherlands-CSFR BIT.\"105 Instead, the tribunal found that the protections available in the BIT were broader than those available under EU law, although it accepted that there may be a certain duplication of rights.106 The Claimant also points to the *Eureko* tribunal's findings that (i) there is no rule in EU law that would prohibit investor-State arbitration, (ii) transnational arbitration is commonplace within the EU, and (iii) the ECJ does not have an \"interpretative monopoly\" on considering and applying EU law.107\n\n*Ibid.*, citing *Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6239ff.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b684-86, citing *Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6\u00b6249, 263-264.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b688, citing *Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6\u00b6274, 277, 282-283.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant also discusses *Eastern Sugar*, another case under the Netherlands-CSFR BIT where the tribunal found that neither the Europe Agreement with the Czech Republic108 nor the Treaty of Accession provided that the BIT was terminated, and that the BIT and EU law \"do not cover the same precise subject matter\" so that Article 59 of the VCLT does not apply.109 Furthermore, the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal held that if the BIT gives greater rights to the Netherlands and Dutch investors over other EU investors, then \"it will be for those other countries and investors to claim their equal rights. The fact that these rights are unequal does not make them incompatible.\"110\n\n*Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part and the Czech Republic of the other part*, concluded on 4 October 1993, entered into force on 1 February 1995 (hereinafter \"Europe Agreement with the Czech Republic\").\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b689, citing *Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6\u00b6158-177.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b690, citing *Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6170.\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that any termination under Article 59 of the VCLT must follow the procedure laid out in Article 65 VCLT, requiring explicit termination by notice of the grounds to the other Party and that no notice was provided by either State Party to the BIT.111\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n***(3) The Amici Curiae***\n--------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe EC requests the Tribunal to declare that it has no jurisdiction.112 The EC alleges that arbitral awards rendered in breach of EU public order, such as those rendered pursuant to agreements between EU Member States which confer jurisdiction on tribunals not bound by EU law and which rule on EU law, \"cannot be recognised or enforced in the European Union.\"113\n\nObservations of the European Commission, p. 5.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 2.\n\n117.\n\nThe EC does not base its submissions upon Article 59 VCLT, since the application of that provision is a matter of public international law and the EC confines its arguments to EU law. Nevertheless, the EC maintains that the Treaty deals with \"subject matters that fall squarely within the scope of the Treaty [on] the Functioning of the European Union\" (\" **TFEU** \"), specifically the rules on foreign investment activity including postestablishment treatment and operation.114 The EC submits that the principle of nondiscrimination on grounds of nationality requires the same treatment of investors from all EU Member States \"as regards both substantive standards of protection and procedural remedies.\"115\n\n*Ibid*. (emphasis in original).\n\n*Ibid*\n\n118.\n\nThe EC notes that where arbitration claims involve questions of the \"application and interpretation of law covered by the EU treaties, EU law takes precedence. Where there is a conflict with EU law, the general international law rule of *\u2018pacta sunt servanda* ' does not apply to treaties concluded between EU Member States.\"116 The EC stresses that it is the domestic courts of Member States which must ensure the correct application of EU law and guarantee procedural and substantive protection to private parties for breaches of EU law, with oversight by the ECJ to determine whether the Member States have fulfilled their obligation under EU law and to rule on questions of EU law as requested by EU domestic courts.117 The EC submits that the \"right of individuals to compensation from Member States for breaches of EU law is firmly grounded in EU law and is a principle inherent in the system of EU law.\"118 The EC also notes that in the TFEU, EU Member States agreed not to submit disputes involving the application or interpretation of EU law to a method of dispute settlement other than those set out in the EU treaties.119\n\n*Ibid*., p. 3.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 4, citing Art. 344 TFEU; Case C-459/03 *Commission v. Ireland* [2006] ECR I-4635 (RL-431), \u00b6177 (hereinafter \" *Mox Plant* \").\n\n119.\n\nThe EC further alleges that an \"international agreement cannot affect the allocation of responsibilities defined in the European treaties, including the autonomy of the European Union legal system and the exclusive jurisdiction of EU courts\", and notes that a private party cannot rely on an international agreement to justify a possible breach of EU law, nor can it rely on dispute settlement mechanisms that conflict with the EU judicial system.120\n\nObservations of the European Commission, p. 4.\n\n120.\n\nThe EC concludes by drawing attention to Opinion 1/09 delivered by the ECJ on 8 March 2011, which found that a court, set up outside the institutional and judicial framework of the European Union to resolve patent-related disputes between private parties, was not compatible with the provisions of European Union treaties.121 The EC relies on Opinion 1/09 to argue that \"the investor-state arbitration mechanism set out in the bilateral investment treaty on which the arbitral tribunal dealing with PCA Case No. 2010-17 was established is incompatible with the provisions of the European Union treaties\" since the Tribunal is outside the institutional and judicial framework of the European Union, given that it cannot make references to the ECJ for issues relating to interpretation of EU law and is not obliged to respect EU law.122\n\n*Ibid*., pp. 4-5, citing ECJ Opinion 1/09, *Opinion delivered pursuant to Article 218(11) TFEU*, 8 March 2011, ECR 2011 (RL-385) (hereinafter \" *Opinion 1/09* \").\n\n*Ibid*., p. 5.\n\n121.\n\nThe Czech Republic submits that the BITs it concluded with other EU Member States are obsolete by virtue of its accession to the EU.123 The Czech Republic submits that Articles 59(1) and 30(3) of the VCLT designate the later treaty as the point of reference to assess incompatibility and the intent to terminate the earlier treaty.124 The Czech Republic notes that there are Member States which consider that BITs can function in parallel to the EC Treaties and that there are Member States, like itself, which consider the overlap between the BIT provisions and EU law to be substantial and do not intend that BITs between EU Member States should remain in effect.125\n\nObservations of the Czech Republic, \u00b617.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b613-15.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b616.\n\n122.\n\nThe Czech Republic finds that the procedures of Article 65 of the VCLT do not apply to Article 59 of the VCLT which is a special case of abrogation through the parties' consent, as evidenced by its practice with Norway.126 The Czech Republic notes that when it and Norway confirmed the validity of bilateral treaties concluded between the CSFR and Norway, the two States had agreed that a number of bilateral agreements had been terminated in accordance with Article 59 of the VCLT.127\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b622-23.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b622.\n\n123.\n\nThe Czech Republic submits that the incompatibility of the BIT with EU law is established to the extent that the Tribunal finds that the BIT and EU law relate to the same subject matter.128 The Czech Republic also submits that the Tribunal should adopt a broad view of \"sameness\" and incompatibility.129 The Czech Republic observes that the *Eureko* tribunal employed an unduly strict understanding of incompatibility when it found that the permissibility of an act under EU law and its prohibition under the BIT did not constitute incompatibility.130\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b631.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b627-29.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b632.\n\n124.\n\nThe Czech Republic alleges that to the \"extent that EU law and the [Treaty] indeed relate to the same subject matter, the dispute settlement mechanism established in Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law.\"131 The Czech Republic notes that arbitral tribunals established under Article 8 of the BIT cannot request a preliminary ruling by the ECJ on the interpretation of EU law under Article 234 of the EC Treaty, and that Article 8 of the BIT may violate the principle of non-discrimination under Article 12 of the EC Treaty.132\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b634.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b635-36.\n\n125.\n\nThe Republic of Austria submits that the BIT is still in force.133 It mentions that in a note dated 5 May 2011, the Respondent \"informally indicated its interest in exploring avenues to terminate the Agreement\" but highlights that it was only a request for an exchange of views and not a formal notification.134 In its reply on 20 May 2011, Austria expressed its view that the BIT continues to be in force and indicated that it was ready to enter into consultations under Article 9 of the BIT if so desired.135 Austria observes that the issue of the *lex posterior* rule of Article 59 of the VCLT has been dealt with \" *in extenso* by the *Eastern Sugar* and the *Eureko* tribunals\" and that Austria concurs with their findings, contending that none of the criteria of Article 59 of the VCLT is met.136 Austria notes that the EU treaties and the BIT \"have different objectives and a different content\" with the former aiming at establishing a monetary and economic union in the wider context of a political union, while the latter is a specific treaty aiming solely at the promotion and protection of investments.137\n\nObservations of the Republic of Austria, p. 1.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n126.\n\nAustria also submits that the notification procedure in Article 65 of the VCLT is applicable to any termination under Article 59 of the VCLT and notes that neither party took any steps to terminate the BIT, contending that, even if the VCLT does not apply, the principle that \"one State cannot impose any rule unilaterally on another State without the latter's consent\" as found in Article 65 of the VCLT, is a rule of customary international law.138 Austria notes that there is a dearth of State practice with respect to Article 59 of the VCLT, but points out that when it concluded a bilateral air transport agreement with another State which overlapped almost article by article with a previous treaty, it notified its view that the earlier agreement was to be considered terminated and did not receive any objection, which it contends is a typical example of the application of Article 59 of the VCLT.139\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 4.\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 4-5.\n\n127.\n\nAustria further observes that applying Article 59 of the VCLT would be inconsistent with the legal effects of EU law since EU law in general does not abrogate contradicting national law or treaties between Member States but rather \"claims prevailing application\" which in terms of treaty law means referring to Article 30 of the VCLT rather than to Article 59 of the VCLT.140 Indeed, Austria asserts that \"[a]ir transport agreements or agreements with neighbouring States on facilitated border-crossings are typical categories of further treaties affected by EU law\" and that as far as Austria is concerned, it does not consider these treaties to have been terminated under Article 59 of the VCLT.141 Austria notes that it only decided to consider an agreement terminated in \"one exceptional case\" which involved an agreement that regulated visa requirements since it was clearly evident that EU law \"covered exactly the same subject-matter in its totality.\"142\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 5.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 6.\n\n128.\n\nAustria submits that since the BIT continues to be in force, the relationship between EU law and the BIT is to be determined in accordance with Article 30 of the VCLT, confined to assessing the incompatibility of Article 8 which is the only relevant provision at the jurisdictional phase.143 Austria distinguishes Opinion 1/09 of the ECJ on the creation of a unified patent litigation system since the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present case is not exclusive, but optional and dependent on the consent of the parties to the dispute.144 The ECJ has already determined that arbitral tribunals are not incompatible with the EU legal order.145 Austria argues that, since it is possible to integrate the Tribunal's award into the EU legal system at the enforcement stage, Article 8 of the BIT is not incompatible with the institutional and jurisdictional framework of the EU.146\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 7.\n\n*Ibid.*, citing *Eco Swiss*, *supra* note 77.\n\nObservations of the Republic of Austria, p. 7.\n\n129.\n\nAustria further contests the argument that allowing for arbitration discriminates against other EU nationals, arguing by analogy from the bilateral double taxation treaties. The ECJ held that Member States could conclude bilateral double taxation agreements in the absence of EU measures involving all Member States, despite the fact that these reciprocal rights and obligations would only apply to residents of two contracting Member States since this was an inherent consequence of such conventions.147\n\n*Ibid*., p. 8, citing Case C-376/03 *D. v. Inspecteur van de Belastingdienst/Particulieren/Ondernemingen buitenland te Heerlen* (Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber) of 5 July 2005) [2005] ECR I-5821 (CL-31), \u00b6\u00b650-63 (hereinafter \" *D.* \" or \" *D. v. Inspecteur* \").\n\n***(4) The Parties' Responses to the Amici Curiae***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Austria's conclusion that the Treaty remains in force and that Article 8 of the Treaty is fully applicable, is erroneous.148 The Respondent notes Austria's concurrence with the *Eureko* and *Eastern Sugar* tribunals, and asserts that its previous submissions address the shortcomings in the reasoning of those awards.149\n\nRespondent's Comment, \u00b624.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b626.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent disputes Austria's observation that, for the purposes of Article 59 of the VCLT, the EU Treaties and the BIT \"do not \u2018relate to the same subject matter' because the EU Treaties also contain \u2018substantial non-economic objectives'.\"150 The Respondent alleges that \"nothing in Article 59 implies a requirement of coextensiveness of purpose\" and that the later treaty may serve \"other, *additional*, objects and purposes\" without excluding the operation of Article 59 of the VCLT.151 Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the objective of the EU Treaties is primarily and most importantly to \"establish a Common Market.\"152 In any event, the Respondent notes that the policy objectives of treaties are not relevant when looking at whether the two treaties \"relate to the same subject matter\" for the purposes of Article 59(1) VCLT.153 Rather, as the Czech Republic also submitted in its observation, \"the criterion of \u2018same subject matter' should be considered fulfilled if two different rules or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the same factual situation.\"154\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b627.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b627-31 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b628, citing *van Gend & Loos*, *supra* note 35, p. 12.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b629.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent further takes issue with Austria's insistence that there is no right to initiate international arbitration under EU law, since the question to be analysed is whether EU law offers effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights.155\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n133.\n\nThe Respondent disputes Austria's submission that termination under Article 59 VCLT requires notification in accordance with Article 65 VCLT and that in any event the requirement of formal notification under Article 65 VCLT has been met by the Slovak Republic's diplomatic note of 5 May 2011.156 According to the Respondent, rather than being an \"\u2018informal' indication of interest in \u2018exploring avenues to terminate the Agreement' \u2026 the Slovak Republic expressly notified Austria of its view that \u2018upon accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union, our BITs entered into with other EU Member States must be considered as terminated by virtue of Article 59 VCLT, or at the very least inapplicable by virtue of Article 30(3) VCLT', asking at the same time Austria to \u2018outline its willingness to terminate mutually the BIT' for the sake of legal certainty.\"157\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b639-41.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b641.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent concedes the validity of Austria's observation that \"applying Article 59 [VCLT] would be inconsistent with the legal effect of EU law\" since EU law does not abrogate earlier treaties but rather claims prevailing application, yet asserts that the \"implicit termination of conflicting treaty obligations among Member States is not an unprecedented phenomenon in the EU legal order\", noting Austria's reference to the agreement with the Slovak Republic on the abolishment of visa requirements, which was terminated in accordance with Article 59 VCLT by virtue of EU law.158\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b643.\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with Austria's observation that incompatibility requires that \"two provisions cannot be applied at the same time in the sense that applying one necessarily entails the violation of the other.\"159 The Respondent asserts that this position has been refuted by the \"work of the ILC and academic authority, which consider incompatibility to exist also where a treaty provision frustrates the goals of another treaty provision relating to the same subject matter without there being any incompatibility *stricto sensu* between the two provisions.\"160\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b644-45.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b645.\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent disputes Austria's attempt to distinguish the relevance of Opinion 1/09 which dealt with setting up a patent court, submitting that the view that international arbitration is optional and therefore unlike the exclusive jurisdiction of the patent court, goes against its \"previous statement on the investor's right to initiate international arbitration proceedings being \u2018an *essential* characteristic of the BIT, which cannot be found in EU law'.\"161\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b647, citing *Opinion 1/09*, *supra* note 121.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent further takes issue with Austria's reliance on the ECJ decisions of *Nordsee* and *Eco Swiss* for the proposition that the Tribunal's awards can be integrated into the EU legal system so that Article 8 of the BIT is not incompatible with Article 267 TFEU.162 The Respondent submits that \"[t]hese cases concerned arbitration agreements entered into by *private* entities\" which, *contra* to Member States, are not responsible for ensuring that EU law obligations are complied with.163\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b649, citing Case C-102/81 *Nordsee Deutsche Hochseefischerei GmbH v. Reederei Mond Hockseefischerei Nordstern AG* [1982] ECR 01095 (RL-69) and *Eco Swiss*, *supra* note 77.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes Austria's observation that the discriminatory effects of Article 8 of the BIT is an \"inherent consequence\" of the BIT and should be tolerated under EU law in the same way that reciprocal rights and obligations under bilateral conventions for the avoidance of double taxation are tolerated under EU law.164 The discriminatory effects of the BIT \"cannot be properly considered an \u2018inherent consequence' of the Treaty.\"165\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b651.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b652.\n\n139.\n\nFinally, the Respondent takes issue with Austria's observation that the discriminatory effects of the nationality requirement in the BIT can easily be remedied since any national of an EU Member State can organise their investments in a way that would allow them to satisfy the nationality requirement.166 The Respondent takes this point as evidence of the \"anomaly\" of the continued existence of BITs within the EU internal market.167\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b653-54.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b653.\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimant focuses its comments on the observations of the EC and those of the Czech Republic.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the EC's contention that investor-State arbitration is outside the legal and judicial order of the EU is wrong.168 Furthermore, the Claimant argues \"that EU law contains no standards of protection for private investors that would even only remotely be comparable to those under the Treaty\" and that \"the recognition of arbitration in the legal and judicial system of the EU is an expression of the mutual trust by EU Member States in the administration of justice.\"169\n\nClaimant's Comment, \u00b63.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b64.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant notes that, while the EC describes its observations as a summary of the position it took in *Eureko*, the position the EC took in *Eureko*, as well as in *Eastern Sugar*, was actually that \"intra-EU BITs are not automatically terminated by virtue of EU accession\" and that \"to terminate these BITs, EU Member States would have to strictly follow the relevant procedure provided in the BITs.\"170\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b68.\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the EC's observation that the investor-State arbitration mechanism is incompatible with the EU legal and judicial order, noting that this is contrary to the *Eco Swiss* judgment.171\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b614-17, 28.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant takes issue with the relevance of Opinion 1/09 concerning the establishment of a patents court with exclusive jurisdiction, which was cited both by the EC and the Czech Republic.172 The Claimant distinguishes the proposed court from international investment arbitration since that court had the power to \"examine the validity of an act of the European Union.\"173\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b618.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b621.\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimant notes that every EU Member State has its own arbitration laws and is a member of the New York Convention, which implicitly recognises that disputes \"which may potentially involve rules of EU law may be settled by arbitration to the exclusion of national courts\" and that were the EC's observation correct, \"it could be argued that each and every EU Member State would be infringing EU law by allowing for arbitration and obliging itself to enforce foreign arbitral awards.\"174\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b625.\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the reliance, by the EC and the Czech Republic in their observations, on Article 292 of the EC Treaty in support of the view that Article 8 of the BIT conflicts with the exclusive jurisdiction of the ECJ. Rather, the Claimant posits that \"Article 292 of the EC Treaty (Article 344 TFEU) deals with disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties between Member States\" which are \"extremely rare\" and which has no application for arbitrations such as the one at hand which is not between two EU Member States.175\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b632.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimant questions the EC's reference to the basic principle of mutual trust by EU Member States in the application of EU law and in the administration of justice, submitting that the EC \"does not attempt to elaborate what purpose \u2026 is served by reference to that principle.\"176 If the EC's purpose is to indicate that it considers submitting disputes to arbitration to be an expression of distrust in the domestic courts of the EU, then the Claimant points to *Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 on* *Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters* (\" **Brussels I** \") which excludes arbitration from its ambit, \"thereby expressly (by exclusion) recognizing and accepting arbitration on the level of EU law.\"177\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b644.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b644, citing *Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters* (CL-132) (hereinafter \"Brussels I\").\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimant highlights that the relevant question is not whether the dispute settlement mechanism of Article 8 of the Treaty is outside the EU legal and judicial order (which the Claimant maintains it is not), but rather \"if and to which extent the arbitrators may or may have to apply relevant EU law, whether that relevant EU law constitutes \u2018public policy' and to which extent, if any, the Swedish courts may review an award in the light of EU law when seized with a relevant application.\"178\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b635.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimant takes issue with the EC's view that arbitrators are not obliged to respect EU law, asserting that arbitrators do have to apply the applicable law to the case that may include elements of EU law, and which cannot simply be disregarded.179\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b636.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Czech Republic's observations on the status of intra-EU BITs by virtue of EU accession are a *non sequitur*.180 The Claimant alleges that the Czech Republic adduces no evidence of consent as required by Article 54 VCLT and that the Protocol between the Czech Republic and Norway is not evidence of State practice.181\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b651.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b649-51.\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimant further takes issue with the Czech Republic's observation regarding the Treaty having been rendered inapplicable under Article 30 VCLT, to the extent that the Treaty and EU law relate to the same subject-matter and are thus incompatible. The Claimant highlights that \"[t]here is not only no identity, there is also no incompatibility.\"182 The Claimant asserts that the Czech Republic's definition of \"sameness of subject matter\" is circular since it involves looking at whether the two different rules are invoked in regard to the \"same matter.\"183 The Claimant argues, agreeing with Austria's submission, that \"despite some overlaps between provisions of EU law and BITs, the two are parallel systems with their own scope of protection and offering their own remedies.\"184\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b653-54.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b653-55.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b653.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the Czech Republic's observation on \"incompatibility\" of the Treaty with EU law, noting that the Czech Republic uses a broad understanding of incompatibility.185 The Claimant asserts that the guarantees in the Treaty and the fundamental freedoms of the EU do not point in different directions but rather \"exist side by side and \u2018point' into the same direction.\"186\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b657.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b657-60.\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimant further takes issue with the Czech Republic's observation that Article 8 of the Treaty violates the EU principle of non-discrimination which is another circumstance of the Treaty's incompatibility with EU law.187 The Claimant argues that investor-state arbitration cannot be regarded as \"outsourcing\" as described by the EC and submits that extending the availability of arbitration to all EU investors \"leads to a situation where there is no potential breach of EU law.\"188\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b666.\n\n*Ibid*., citing August Reinisch, Supplementary Legal Opinion on Jurisdictional Issues concerning the 1990 Austria/Czech and Slovak Federal Republic BIT, 14 July 2011 (CEWS-4), \u00b6\u00b649-50 (hereinafter \"Reinisch Opinion\").\n\n154.\n\nFinally, the Claimant agrees with the Czech Republic in its conclusion that the Treaty has not been terminated under Article 59(1)(a) VCLT, since the treaties themselves are silent on the issue and no intent has been manifested to terminate the Treaty.189 The Claimant refers to a decision by the Municipal Court of Prague on the challenge of an award on jurisdiction in *Binder v. the Czech Republic* which held that the Czech-German BIT was \"valid and effective.\"190 The Claimant further notes that the Czech Republic still considers that the BIT between it and Austria is in effect as it is listed as such on the homepage of the Czech Ministry of Finance and that while it has renegotiated certain BITs, it has left the investor-State mechanism untouched.191 Thus the \"conduct of the Czech Republic indicates that it did not maintain its view that its intra-EU BITs were automatically terminated\", noting that in 2009, the Czech Republic requested that various other EU Member States agree to terminate their bilateral treaties with the Czech Republic.192\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b667.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b669, citing *Czech Republic v. Binder*, Municipal Court of Prague, Resolution dated 2 July 2010, Case No. 18 Co 164/2010-183 (CL-206), p. 6.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b668.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b671.\n\n***2. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it worth noting that, for Article 59 of the VCLT to apply, two conditions have to be met:\n\n(a) the first treaty (here the BIT) and the second treaty (here the ECT) must relate to the same subject matter; and\n\n(b) if this condition is fulfilled then, the ratification of the second treaty will terminate the first treaty if either:\n\n(1) the two States must be taken to have intended that the second treaty should supersede the first treaty (*the subjective condition*); or\n\n(2) the provisions of the first treaty must be so far incompatible with the provisions of the second treaty that the two are not capable of being applied at the same time (*the objective condition*).\n\nThe Tribunal will analyse whether each of these conditions is satisfied.\n\n***(1) Do the ECT and the BIT relate to \"the same subject matter\"?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) What is the test for determining that the two treaties have the \"same subject matter\"?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nProfessor Vierdag, relied upon by the Respondent, comments that \"the requirement that the instruments must relate to the same subject-matter seems to raise extremely difficult problems in theory, but may turn out not to be so very difficult in practice.\"193\n\nE.W. Vierdag, \"The Time of the \u2018Conclusion' of a Multilateral Treaty: Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and Related Provisions\", BYBIL vol. 59 (1988) (RL-147), p. 100.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that this requirement is easy in practice, but certainly agrees that it is a difficult theoretical question.\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent supports an extensive interpretation of this requirement, invoking the International Law Commission Report on Fragmentation of International Law.194 According to the approach of the ILC,\n\nThe criterion of \"same subject-matter\" seems already fulfilled if two different rules or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the same matter, or if, in other words, as a result of interpretation, the relevant treaties seem to point to different directions in their application by a party.195\n\n\u2026the test of whether two treaties deal with the \"same subject matter\" is resolved through the assessment of whether the fulfilment of the obligation under one treaty affects the fulfilment of the obligation of another. This \"affecting\" might then take place either as strictly preventing the fulfilment of the other obligation or undermining its object and purpose in one or another way.196\n\nILC Report, *supra* note 43.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b623.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6254.\n\n159.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this means that the \"criterion of sameness must be considered fulfilled if two *different* rules or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the *same* factual situation.\"197 Under this expansive approach, this would mean that *two rules have the same subject matter if they apply to the same facts.*\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b655 (emphasis in original). *See* also, Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b640: \"the requirement of \u2018same subject matter' is satisfied when the implicated treaties both lay a normative claim to regulate the same facts.\"\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimant mainly relied, in its Counter Memorial, on the findings of the *Eastern Sugar* and *Eureko* tribunals stating that the EC Treaty does not relate to the same subject matter as the relevant BITs, without attempting to elaborate on the theoretical meaning of the \"same subject matter.\" A more abstract approach was adopted in the Rejoinder, in other words giving mainly a negative definition of when it cannot be considered that two rules have the same subject matter but without attempting to provide a more positive definition:\n\nAn ordinary meaning of what is to be understood to be the \" *same* \" should be the basis for an understanding the phrase (sic) \" *the same subject matter* \". Usually, \" *same* \" does not mean that two things are merely comparable or, when it comes to different sets of laws, simply deal with issues arising from the same facts.198\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b643 (emphasis in original).\n\n161.\n\nIn other words, the Claimant refutes the analysis of the Respondent and seems to adopt a more restrictive interpretation, although it relies \"on the ordinary meaning\", considering that *it is not enough that two rules apply to the same facts for those rules to have the same subject matter.* But no further indication is provided on characterising a situation where two treaties have the same subject matter.\n\n162.\n\nBefore the *Eureko* tribunal, the Respondent argued that the BIT and the ECT relate to the same subject matter, because they cover the same types of investors (*i.e.* natural persons and legal entities) and investments, serve the same purposes (*i.e.* to broaden and strengthen the economic relations), offer the same standards of protection relating to the establishment of investments (*i.e.* equal treatment and non-discrimination, free movement of capital, protection of proprietary rights) and provide for equivalent remedies:\n\nUnder EU law, investors pursue their claims before national courts with involvement of the ECJ via a preliminary ruling procedure; and under the BIT investors can have their dispute heard before an arbitral tribunal. Both mechanisms aim at the same objective, namely the protection of investments. Under both mechanisms, investors may seek compensation for damages from States for unlawful conduct \u2026199\n\n*Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b671.\n\n163.\n\nHere the emphasis is somewhat different, in that it is mainly stated that *two rules have the same subject matter if they have the same goal.*\n\n164.\n\nLittle can be found on this issue in the *Eastern Sugar* case, where the tribunal was content to state, without further conceptual definition, that \"the two regulations do not cover the same precise subject-matter.\"200 The *Binder* tribunal did not even raise the issue.\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6160 (emphasis added).\n\n165.\n\nAfter a review of the different elements of analysis that have been advanced in order to interpret the expression \"same subject matter\", the question remains: how should \"same subject matter\" be understood?\n\n166.\n\nIt is the Tribunal's view that the terms of the VCLT are to be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with their ordinary meaning in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the VCLT. There is, therefore, no presumption in favour of either a broad or a narrow interpretation. The necessity of a balanced interpretation in good faith has already been emphasised in various decisions of arbitral tribunals, such as in the *AMCO* decision:\n\n\u2026 a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties \u2026 Moreover, \u2026 any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.201\n\n*Amco Asia et al. v. Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 (Decision on Jurisdiction, September 25, 1983) 23 ILM 351 (1984), \u00b614 (hereinafter \" *AMCO* \").\n\n167.\n\nThe same principle was adopted in the *El Paso* tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\nThis Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into account both State sovereignty and the State's responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow.202\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, (Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006), \u00b670.\n\n168.\n\nIn performing a good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the expression \"same subject matter\", the Tribunal first adopts a negative approach and rejects the interpretation according to which the \"same subject matter\" can be equated to being applicable to \"the same facts,\" or having \"the same goal.\"\n\n169.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that the wording of Article 59 of the VCLT is not that the two treaties must apply to the same facts or same situations but that they must deal with the same *subject matter*. Even if two different rules deal with issues arising from the same facts, it does not necessarily mean that they have the same subject matter. This can be seen from a simple example: a treaty on environmental protection and a treaty on trade may both apply to the same factual situation but the subject matter with which they deal is quite different.\n\n170.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal notes that the wording of Article 59 of the VCLT does not support the argument that it is sufficient for two treaties to have the same goal for them to have the same subject matter. For example, two treaties can each have the goal of enhancing the well-being of children, one in providing for an international mechanism of monitoring of child labour, another in deciding that children under fourteen may not be married against their will. Yet no reasonable person would consider that those two treaties, although pursuing the same goal, the same overall purpose, have the same subject matter.\n\n171.\n\nThe subject matter of a treaty, in the Tribunal's understanding, therefore differs both from the concrete situations in which it will be applicable and from its goal. Accordingly, the Tribunal regards as irrelevant the Respondent's statement that\n\nIt cannot be seriously disputed that investment protection, the subject matter of the Treaty, is an important means for attaining the objective of a common market under the EC Treaty \"characterised by the abolition, between Member States, of obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.\"203\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6103.\n\n172.\n\nIt is moreover the view of the Tribunal, which adopts next a positive approach, that the subject matter of a treaty is inherent in the treaty itself and refers to the issues with which its provisions deal, *i.e.* its topic or its substance. The Tribunal will therefore focus on that question when determining whether or not the BIT and the ECT have the same subject matter.\n\n173.\n\nAn important remark has to be made here by the Tribunal. In its view, the question at issue has invariably been obscured by frequent confusion or conflation between sameness and incompatibility. Even the ILC is not free from such error as can be seen when reading the definition of the criterion of \"sameness\":\n\nThe criterion of \" *same* subject-matter\" seems already fulfilled if two different rules or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the same matter, or if, in other words, as a result of interpretation, the relevant treaties seem to point to *different* directions in their application by a party.204\n\nILC Report, *supra* note 43, \u00b623 (emphasis added).\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent seems to be aware, in theory, of the necessity to distinguish the two aspects, when it opines that \"the concept of \u2018same subject matter' should be understood separately from the other requirements of Article 59 of the Vienna Convention\"205, one of which is incompatibility. However in its concrete analysis, the Respondent conflates the two requirements.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6100.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article 59 of the VCLT requires a two-step inquiry. First, do the two treaties \"relate to the same subject matter\"? Secondly, do the rules in those treaties point in the same direction or in different directions, to use the terminology of the ILC? If the answer to the second question is that the two sets of rules point in the same direction, the two treaties can easily coexist and be interpreted in harmony; if the answer is that they point in different directions and the different directions imply a true incompatibility, the latter treaty prevails. However, that second question arises only if the first question has been answered in the affirmative.\n\n*(b) Application of the test to the facts of the present case*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the two treaties have the same subject matter, since they both regulate investment and investor rights and encompass comparable substantive and procedural standards. For example, Slovakia argued during the oral hearing that \"EU law and the BIT regulate their common subject matter in substantially similar ways, which far exceeds minor or incidental overlap.\"206 The EC, in its submission, also stated that \"[t]he bilateral investment treaty\u2026deals with subject matters that fall squarely within the scope of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.\"207\n\nRespondent's Hearing Presentation, p. 5.\n\nObservations of the European Commission, p. 2.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimant, on the contrary, considers that the two treaties do not have the same subject matter. The Claimant's position was summarized during the oral hearing in the following way:\n\nThe EU liberalization guarantee (market access) focus on pre-establishment phase\n\nTreaty gives no automatic right of access (only in accordance with \"[i]ts [Slovakia's] laws\"; focus on post-establishment phase208\n\nClaimant's Hearing Presentation, Day 1, 19 December 2011, p. 20 (emphasis in original).\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal, after thorough analysis, has come to the conclusion that the two treaties do not have the same overall subject matter. When asking \"with what issues do the rules of the two treaties deal?\" it is evident that the treaties do not deal with the same issues. The ECT deals with the creation of an internal market,209 the BIT with the fostering of international flows of investment by protecting the rights of the investors.\n\n*See*, now, Art. 3(3), Treaty on the European Union.\n\n179.\n\nThe *Eastern Sugar* tribunal, looking at the \"precise\" subject matter of the ECT and the BIT determined that \"[t]he European Union guarantees the free movement of capital\"210, while \"[b]y contrast, the BIT provides for fair and equitable treatment of the investor during the investor's investment in the host country.\u2026 the BIT also provides for a special procedural protection\"211, adding:\n\nFrom the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the arbitration clause is in practice the most essential provision of Bilateral Investment Treaties. \u2026 EU law does not provide such a guarantee.212\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6161.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6164.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6165.\n\n180.\n\nIn other words, the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal arrived at the conclusion that the two treaties did not have the same subject matter, relying mainly on two features. First, the two treaties had a generally different approach, the ECT being more focused on the preestablishment period, and the BIT on the post-establishment period. Secondly, a specific element linked with the remedies open to an investor when it considers that its rights have been infringed is dealt with differently by the two treaties, since only the BIT offers the investor access to international arbitration.\n\n181.\n\nThe *Eureko* tribunal also acknowledged, that \"[n]othing in Article 59 requires that the two treaties should be in all respects co-extensive; but the later treaty must have more than a minor overlap or incidental overlap with the earlier treaty.\"213\n\n*Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6242.\n\n182.\n\nAlthough employing different analyses, these two tribunals arrived at the same conclusion as this Tribunal.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to add that it cannot be denied that the subject matter of the BIT is foreign investment. It is also well-known that, until the Lisbon Treaty, foreign direct investment was not one of the competences of the EU. This would almost suffice to conclude that the two treaties, the Austria-Slovakia BIT and the ECT do not have the same subject matter. If the European Union had no jurisdiction to deal with direct investment, it would be difficult to argue that the EU Treaties have the same subject matter \u2013 direct investment \u2013 as the BITs, of which direct investment is one of the subject matters.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the EU Treaties and the EU law rooted in, and flowing from them do not relate to the same subject matter as BITs or multilateral treaties for the protection of foreign investment. To accede to an economic community is simply not the same as to set up a specific investment protection regime providing for investor-State arbitration.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the two treaties do not have the same subject matter. It follows that the BIT has not been terminated by virtue of the application of Article 59 VCLT.\n\n***(2) Did the Parties to the BIT manifest an intention to terminate that Treaty or are the BIT and the ECT incapable of being applied at the same time?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion that the BIT and the ECT do not relate to the same subject matter is determinative of the Article 59 of the VCLT argument. However, even if the Tribunal had reached a different conclusion on that point, it would nevertheless have found that the other requirements of Article 59 of the VCLT were not met. It will be recalled that Article 59 of the VCLT provides that where the parties to a treaty conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter, the earlier treaty is terminated only if either (a) it appears from the later treaty, or is otherwise established, that the parties intended to terminate the earlier treaty (the *subjective* test) or (b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier treaty that the two are not capable of being applied at the same time (the *objective* test). The Tribunal considers that, in the present case, neither test is met. It will briefly set out its reasons for that conclusion.\n\n*(a) The subjective test*\n-------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe question here is whether the States Parties to the BIT manifested in one way or another a clear common intention to terminate the BIT?\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent infers such an intention from the mere existence of the ECT. According to the Respondent, \"the very magnitude, scope and fundamentality of the obligations undertaken in the second treaty can evidence the States Parties' necessary intent to supersede and replace an earlier treaty addressing the same subject matter.\"214\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6123.\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimant considers that \"the intention of the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Austria to terminate or suspend the Treaty is not manifested at all. The Accession Treaty \u2013 whether by its nature or words \u2013 does clearly not provide for any manifestations of such intention.\"215\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b657.\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to the EU Commission's submission in the *Eureko* case,216 on which it commented:\n\nIn its observations submitted to the Tribunal, the EU Commission itself did not discern any intention of the parties to abrogate earlier intra-EU BITs in the 2003 Act of Accession and stated that the intra-EU BITs have not been implicitly terminated or suspended pursuant to Article 59 VCLT following the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.217\n\nObservations by the European Commission in the arbitration *Eureko B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, 7 July 2010 (RL-382) (hereinafter \"EC Observations in *Eureko* \").\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b683.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's argument that, by its very nature, the ECT demonstrated an implied intent to terminate the BITs between Members and non-Members of the EU that were transformed into intra-EU BITs by the accession of Slovakia to the EU.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that nothing in the EU Treaties gives such an indication of intent, rather to the contrary. As rightly emphasised by the Claimant, \"[n]owhere does the Accession Treaty say that \u2026 [the] Accession Treaty and EU law \u2018 *govern the matter* ' of bilateral investment treaty protection with its protection standards and enforcement mechanisms. The Accession Treaty and the European Treaties do also not say anything about investment protection for investors of one EU Member State in another Member State.\"218\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b640 (emphasis in original).\n\n193.\n\nOn the contrary, the Europe Agreement which entered into force one month after the BIT, includes certain articles that would rather indicate that all rights belonging to economic operators should be preserved until equivalent rights are granted in the framework of the EU:\n\nARTICLE 74\n\nINVESTMENT PROMOTION AND PROTECTION\n\n1. Co-operation shall aim to establish a favourable climate for private investment, both domestic and foreign, which is essential to economic and industrial reconstruction in the Slovak Republic.\n\n2. The particular aims of co-operation shall be:\n\n- to improve the institutional framework for investments in the Slovak Republic;\n\n- the extension by the Member States and the Slovak Republic of agreements for the promotion and protection of investment;\n\nARTICLE 118\n\nThis Agreement shall not, until equivalent rights for individuals and economic operators have been achieved under this Agreement, affect rights assured to them through existing agreements binding one or more Member States, on the one hand, and the Slovak Republic, on the other.\n\n194.\n\nIt is difficult for the Tribunal to consider that the express aim of the Europe Agreement of an \"extension by the Member States and the Slovak Republic of agreements for the promotion and protection of investment\" could be considered as an implied intent to terminate them. Moreover, although the Europe Agreement does not deal expressly with the termination of the BITs, it appears, in the view of the Tribunal, that it implies that unless rights equivalent to those from which they benefitted under BITs before accession to the EU were conferred upon investors by the EU law, such rights should be maintained. This leans rather in the direction of maintaining the BIT since it is quite difficult to deny that, under the EU framework, the foreign investors do not have, for example, the direct right to bring international arbitration proceedings against the State in which they have invested, a right which is a central feature of the BIT.\n\n195.\n\nNeither can the BIT be interpreted as embodying a common intention that it will be terminated if more favourable treatment is accorded to investors under a later treaty. Article 7(1) of the BIT reads\n\nIf under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties or under international obligations now or in the future undertaken between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement there exists a general or special regime whereby the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party are accorded more favourable treatment than under this Agreement, the said regime shall take precedence over the present Agreement to the extent that it is more favourable.\n\n196.\n\nIt is clear that what the two States Parties had in mind was that future treaties between them would complement the States Parties' rights and obligations, and not that such treaties would replace provisions in the BIT.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it cannot find an implied intention in the treaties adopted in view of the accession to the EU, or in the ECT, to terminate the BIT.\n\n198.\n\nNor is the Tribunal persuaded that there is evidence extrinsic to the treaties which manifests such a shared intention. It is common ground between the Parties that even if some express manifestation of a wish to terminate the BIT has been performed by Slovakia, this has not been followed by a common decision of the States Parties to terminate the BIT.\n\n199.\n\nThe BIT includes some rules for its termination, which have not been utilised by the Parties:\n\nArticle 11\n\nEntry into Force and Term\n\n(1) This Agreement is subject to ratification and shall enter into force on the first day of the third month that follows the month during which the instruments of ratification have been exchanged.\n\n(2) The Agreement shall remain in force for ten years; upon the expiry of that period, it shall be extended for an indefinite period of time and may be denounced by either Contracting Party subject to twelve months' prior notice in writing through the diplomatic channel.\n\n(3) In the case of investments that will have been made before the date of denunciation of this Agreement, articles 1 to 10 of this Agreement shall apply for a further ten years from that date.219\n\nThe Respondent's certified translation from the Czech original (RL-40A).\n\n200.\n\nThe BIT entered into force on 1 January 1995. There has been no mutual termination of the BIT, nor an express denunciation by either State Party to the BIT.\n\n201.\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal that upon accession to the EU, the Slovak Republic had sent a note requesting its BIT partners that were EU Member States to accept a *mutual termination*. This document sent by the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic to \"all Member States concerned\", had as its subject heading: \"Request for statement \u2013 *possible termination* of Bilateral Investment Treaties concluded between the EU Member States\" (emphasis added), and stated: \"\u2026 we would like to kindly ask you to outline your Government's willingness *to terminate mutually* the BITs that you have concluded with the Slovak Republic\" (emphasis added).220\n\nMinistry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, Request for Statement - Possible Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties Concluded between the EU Member States, 5 May 2011 (RL-435) (emphasis added).\n\n202.\n\nHowever, no mention has been made by either Party that a mutual agreement was reached between Austria and Slovakia in order to agree to the termination of their BIT. In fact, the Slovak Republic,221 as well as Austria list their common BIT as one of the international treaties to which they are a Party. The Tribunal recalls here that the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal held that implicit termination could not be found in circumstances where both Contracting Parties to the BIT still list the BIT as an international treaty to which they are party.222\n\n*See* for example, Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6108: \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic maintains on its [website's] home page [C-13], a list of all existing BITs, and the Austria/Slovakia BIT is among those listed.\" At the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the Chairman asked the Respondent whether it was \"the case that, as [counsel for the Claimant] said yesterday, the BIT nevertheless remains on the Slovakian Government's website as a treaty in force?\" to which counsel for the Respondent replied that it had \"no reason to doubt that representation. I have not checked it myself. We do not think that that is a significant fact, however. We note the Eureko tribunal also discounted these arguments\" Transcript (Hearing on Jurisdiction), Day 2, 20 December 2011, p. 22:17-25.\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6155.\n\n203.\n\nIn the Tribunal's understanding, a request for a mutual termination which can be considered as a manifestation of *a unilateral intention* or desire to terminate the treaty plainly indicates that the Party making such request did not consider that *a mutual intention* already existed, either as something implicit in the text of the treaty or something which could be inferred from the behaviour of the Parties.\n\n204.\n\nNo notice of termination has been given either by the Slovak Republic or by Austria. This is confirmed in unambiguous terms by the Respondent, when it states that \"[t]here is no suggestion by the Slovak Republic in these proceedings that the BIT would be terminated in accordance with Article 11(2) of the Treaty.\"223\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6211.\n\n205.\n\nIt can also be noted that Austria has reiterated, during the course of this proceeding, its position to the effect that it considers the BIT in force. In a letter dated 18 May 2011 to Euram Bank's counsel, the Austrian Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs, in reply to certain questions, stated the following:\n\n\"(a) Does the Republic of Austria consider the Treaty still to be in force?\n\nBy means of an Exchange of Diplomatic Notes between the Republic of Austria and the Slovak Republic on the continued application of certain Austro-Czechoslovakian Treaties, the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 15 October 1990 was jointly identified as remaining in force and being applicable between the parties. Moreover, the Exchange of Diplomatic Notes also amended the Agreement, so as to insert the designations \"Slovak Republic\" and \"Slovak\" into the text of the Agreement as appropriate.224\n\nLetter from the Republic of Austria of 18 May 2011 (C-28).\n\n206.\n\nThe EU Commission itself has admitted that no BIT has been automatically terminated, since it has asked the States to terminate them, for its own policy reasons:\n\nEventually, all intra-EU BITS will have to be terminated. Commission services intend to contact all Member States again, urging them to take concrete steps soon. Furthermore, while the Commission is in favour of consensual solutions with EU Member States, as guardian of the EU treaties it cannot exclude eventually having to resort to infringement proceedings against certain Member States.225\n\nEC Observations in *Eureko*, *supra* note 216, \u00b638.\n\n207.\n\nIt might also be apposite to cite here an excerpt of the European Commission's letter dated 13 January 2006 which was quoted in the *Eastern Sugar* partial award:\n\nThe Commission therefore takes the view that the intra-EU BITs should be terminated in so far as the matters under the agreements fall under Community competence.\n\n\u2026\n\nHowever, the effective prevalence of the EU acquis does not entail at the same time the automatic termination of the concerned BITs or necessarily the nonapplication of all their provisions.\n\nWithout prejudice to the primacy of Community law, to terminate these agreements Member States would have to strictly follow the relevant procedure provided for this in the agreements themselves.226\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6119.\n\n208.\n\nA request to terminate can logically only mean that the Commission thinks that such termination has not yet taken place. This conclusion has also been arrived at by the tribunal in the *Binder* case:\n\nMoreover, the EU documents to which the Parties have referred in this case do not show that, in the opinion of the EU institutions, BITs have automatically ceased to be operative once both Contracting States have become Member States of the EU. The issue of whether measures should be envisaged to terminate intra-EU BITs as not being well adapted to internal co-operation within the EU has given rise to some debate within the EU but has not been finally settled even as a policy matter to this date.227\n\n*Binder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL (Award on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2007) (CL-202), \u00b664 (hereinafter \" *Binder* \").\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal thus comes to the same conclusion as the *Eureko* tribunal concerning the termination of the BIT, when it noted that \"[n]othing in the text of the EU Treaties produces that result; and the necessary intention is not established by extraneous evidence.\"228\n\n*Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6244.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, even if the BIT and the ECT were considered as having the same subject matter, the BIT could not be deemed terminated on the basis of a common intention of the Parties.\n\n*(b) The objective test*\n------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to the objective question outlined in paragraph 186, above, namely whether there is such a measure of incompatibility between the provisions of the BIT and the ECT that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there does not exist such an incompatibility between the two treaties that the former, the BIT, must be considered as having been automatically terminated. The same solution has indeed been adopted in *Binder*, *Eastern Sugar* and *Eureko*. Before elaborating on a comparison between the two treaties, the Tribunal will however try to clarify the meaning of \"incompatibility\" in the VCLT.\n\n**(i) What is the test for finding that there is \"incompatibility\"?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the question on a theoretical plane: what does it mean to say that two treaties are incompatible?\n\n214.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is not necessary that one act be permissible under one treaty, but not permissible under the other treaty for incompatibility to arise. Rather, it is sufficient that \"a treaty *frustrates* the goals of another treaty *without* there being any incompatibility *stricto sensu* between their respective provisions.\"229\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6138 (emphasis in original).\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimant has offered a definition of what \"incompatibility\" means during the oral hearing, when it explained that\n\nTheoretically, substantive incompatibility only if, in EU law, either\n\n(i) mandatory higher protection standard than in BIT  \n (ii) mandatory lower protection standard than in BIT.230\n\nClaimant's Hearing Presentation, Day 1, 19 December 2011, p. 32.\n\n216.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as always when interpreting a treaty, it is necessary to go back to the ordinary meaning of the text. According to the Tribunal, \"incompatibility\" is explained in the text of Article 59 of the VCLT itself, by the words that are used: \"the two treaties cannot be applied at the same time.\" The Tribunal considers that this phrase limits incompatibility to the case where one treaty requires what the other treaty prohibits; in other words, conflict occurs when compliance with one treaty necessarily causes a breach of the other treaty. The Tribunal does not consider that incompatibility extends to a situation where something that is forbidden under the BIT is merely permitted by EU law, or vice versa.231\n\nThis position was however adopted in other fora dealing with international economic relations as mentioned by the Respondent in its Reply: The World Trade Organization panel in the *Bananas III* case defined the notion of \"conflict\" between obligations under GATT 1994 and the Annex 1A WTO Agreements along similar lines. The panel stressed that the conflict clause is designed to deal with clashes between obligations contained in GATT 1994 and obligations contained in agreements listed in Annex 1A, not only where those obligations are mutually exclusive (in the sense that a Member cannot comply with both obligations at the same time), but also where \"a rule in one agreement prohibits what a rule in another agreement explicitly permits.\" Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6167. *See*, WTO Panel Report, *European Communities - Regime for the Importation, Sale and Distribution of Bananas*, WT/DS27/R, adopted on Sep. 25, 1997 (RL-423), \u00b67,159 and note 728.\n\n217.\n\nThis means, *a fortiori*, that the Tribunal does not consider that two treaties are incompatible when they point in the same direction or when the rules they adopt are similar.\n\n**(ii) Applying that test, are the BIT and the ECT so far incompatible that they are not capable of being applied at the same time?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent, while claiming that the two treaties are \"incompatible\", explains that, in its view, \"it cannot be seriously doubted that, in the scope of their attention, they address very much the same subject and indeed do so in very similar ways.\"232 In the Tribunal's view, as already mentioned, this is a conflation of two distinct conditions for the application of Article 59 of the VCLT, the \"sameness\" and the \"incompatibility.\" The Tribunal finds it difficult to accept the idea that two treaties dealing with the same topic in a similar way are completely incompatible. It would rather consider that the two treaties go in the same direction and are therefore complementary rather than mutually exclusive.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b657. *See* also, Respondent's Comment, \u00b65: \"EU law and the BIT relate to their common subject matter in similar ways and, in fact, establish substantially equivalent substantive and procedural investment protections.\"\n\n219.\n\nIn the concrete case at hand, the Claimant argues that no such incompatibility exists and moreover that the provisions of the two treaties are\n\neven less incompatible in such a way that they were not capable of being applied at the same time. The core subject of the Treaty is the protection of already existing investments (the \"post-establishment\" phase) whereas EU law concentrates on the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital \u2026 thus the \u2018preestablishment' phase.233\n\nEven if one looks at the standards of protection during the investment phase, no incompatibility can be found:\n\nThe guarantees provided in the Treaty and the fundamental EU freedoms the EU Commission considers as infringed by the Slovak Republic exist side by side and \"point\" into the same direction.234\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b696.\n\nClaimant's Comment, \u00b660.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal has been quite convinced by the powerful demonstration of the Respondent that, if it is admitted that the two treaties have the same subject matter (which is not, of course, the conclusion of the Tribunal, but is discussed here for the sake of completeness and clarification of the issues), they deal with the common questions in quite a similar way, with one exception which will be dealt with further below.\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondent explains that covered investors and investments are similar:\n\n[t]he EC Treaty ensures protection of an investment made in an EU Member State to the same circle of entities as that under the BIT.235\n\n\u2026\n\nIn conclusion, EU law covers investments of the same type as covered under the BIT.236\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b667.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b673.\n\n222.\n\nMoreover, \"with regard to the pre-establishment phase, both the BIT and EU law offer the same concrete protection to investors by supporting market access and prohibiting any restrictions thereof.\"237 The same analysis is pursued as far as the protection of investment during the investment period is concerned.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b677.\n\n223.\n\nConcerning first the protection against expropriation, which was not initially clearly expressed in EU law, the Respondent argues that this is no longer true, because of the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU which formalised the attitude of the EU towards fundamental human rights and in particular the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (\" **ECHR** \") and the jurisprudence of the ECtHR. As a consequence, the protection against expropriation is equivalent in EU law and in the BIT.238\n\nThe Respondent stresses the fact that considering the narrow dispute settlement in the precise BIT at stake, there is no dispute resolution for expropriation, but only for compensation in case of expropriation, which renders EU law even more favorable than the BIT.\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent's analysis of the other standards of protection is to the same effect:\n\nTreatment standards established in the BIT, such as non-expropriation, \"fair and equitable treatment,\" \"national treatment,\" \"most favored nation treatment\", correspond to core \"treatment standards\" in EU law, enunciated in the EC Treaty provisions regarding the fundamental freedoms.239\n\n\u2026\n\nEU law includes protections that are very much equivalent to the composite obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment under the BIT.240\n\n\u2026\n\nIt follows that the protection and security of investments guaranteed by EU law overlaps completely with the scope of protection considered to be afforded under the most liberal interpretation of the \"full protection and security\" standard that sometimes has been asserted by claimants or the decisions of international investment tribunals.241\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b664.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6105.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6110.\n\n225.\n\nLastly, the Respondent also mentions the overlap of the provisions concerning the free movement of capital and the free transfer of payments.\n\n226.\n\nWithout adhering necessarily to all the details or implications of the Respondent's comparative presentation of a certain number of provisions, the Tribunal considers that it presents an accurate general picture of the plain fact that the two treaties are far from being so incompatible that they cannot be applied at the same time.\n\n227.\n\nA similar conclusion was reached by the *Binder* tribunal:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal further cannot find that the invoked substantive provisions of the Czech-German BIT, *i.e.* Article 2(2), which provides for protection against impairment of investments by arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, Article 2(3), which ensures full protection of investments and revenues, Article 4(1), which provides for full protection and security of investments, and Article 4(2), which stipulates that expropriation must be for public benefit and must be accompanied by full compensation, are in any way in conflict with EC law. Consequently, there is no substantive conflict with EC law, and the question of the primacy of EC law does not arise in respect of these provisions.242\n\n*Binder v. Czech Republic*, *supra* note 227, \u00b663.\n\n228.\n\nIf indeed, the investors are protected in a similar way by two different regimes, why should only one of these regimes be applicable? In such a factual situation, the Tribunal considers that far from being necessarily incompatible, the parallel rules under the BIT and the ECT, can be cumulatively applied.\n\n229.\n\nThe same idea was put forward in the *SPP* case243, where the issue was whether the use of ICC arbitration excluded the use of ICSID arbitration:\n\n[i]t matters not how many different paths are pursued in an effort to obtain that remedy.244\n\n\u2026\n\nThere is in this case no inconsistency in pursuing alternative remedies \u2026 The Claimants are trying to find a competent forum in which to adjudicate their claim245\n\n\u2026\n\nThus, the possibility arises that concurrent jurisdiction might be exercised with respect to the same Parties, the same facts and the same cause of action by two different arbitral tribunals.246\n\n\u2026\n\nWhen the jurisdictions of two unrelated and independent tribunals extend to the same dispute, there is no rule of international law which prevents either tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction.247\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (First Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 November 1985) (hereinafter \" *SPP* \").\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b611.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b613.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b628.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b630.\n\n230.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal is aware that the issues can be distinguished, it considers that the main idea underlying the *SPP* decision is apposite in this case, *i.e.* that the existence of several fora for obtaining remedies does not render them incompatible.248 On the contrary, they must be considered as parallel since they enhance the protection of the investor.\n\nThe Tribunal here takes no view on the question of whether a prior or subsequent agreement to submit disputes to one forum should preclude access another forum, as was at issue in the cases of *SGS v. Pakistan* and *SGS v. Philippines*.\n\n231.\n\nThe parallel rules under the BIT and the ECT are not incompatible, but should be viewed as cumulative. This kind of situation is frequent in international law and has never meant that only one set of rules can be applied. For example, in the *Southern Bluefin Tuna* case (2000), Japan had argued *inter alia* that the 1993 Convention on the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna applied to the case both as *lex specialis* and *lex posterior,* excluding the application of the 1982 UNCLOS. The arbitration tribunal, however, held that both the 1982 as well as the 1993 instrument were applicable. The tribunal recognised that\n\n\u2026 it is a commonplace of international law and State practice for more than one treaty to bear upon a particular dispute. There is no reason why a given act of a State may not violate its obligations under more than one treaty. There is frequently *a parallelism of treaties, both in their substantive content and in their provisions for settlement of disputes arising thereunder*. The current range of international legal obligations benefits from a process of accretion and cumulation.249\n\n*Southern Bluefin Tuna case* (*Australia and New Zealand v. Japan*) (Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 4 August 2000) UNRIAA vol. XXIII (2004) p. 23, \u00b652 (emphasis added).\n\n232.\n\nThis parallelism and complementarity of the BIT and the ECT has also frequently been emphasised in legal writings. For example, Dr Christian Tietje analyses the interaction of the two treaties in the following way:\n\nThere are no convincing legal reasons that would cause intra-EU BITs to be classified as being *per se* incompatible with the law of the European Union. Also in the context of EU law, bilateral investment protection treaties are \"added\" legal guarantees for investors. \u2026 The cancellation of bilateral investment protection treaties between EU member states as demanded by the EU Commission would thus deprive EU citizens of subjective rights. This would be an unparalleled occurrence as regards fundamental principles of the European Union \u2026 Intra-EU BITs help to increase and enhance the overall level of legal protection of economic subjects in the internal market.250\n\nChristian Tietje \"Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties between EU Member States (Intra-EU BITs) as a Challenge in the Multi-Level Legal System\" in Christian Tietje, Gerhard Kraft and Mathias Lehmann (eds.), *Beitr\u00e4ge zum Translationalen Wirtschaftsrecht* (Essays in Transnational Economic Law), number 104 (CL-146), p. 19.\n\n233.\n\nAlthough it deals with the BIT between a Member (Slovakia) and a non Member of the EU (Switzerland) as well as the Energy Charter Treaty on the one side and EU law on the other, the Tribunal considers the opinion of the Advocate-General J\u00e4\u00e4skinen in Case C-264/09, *European Commission v. Slovak Republic* very apposite to the question it is discussing here:\n\nWith respect to the enjoyment and protection of investments, the general level of the protection of fundamental rights provided by EU law affords protection to investors, which fulfils the obligations resulting from Article 10(1) and 13(1) of the ECT.251\n\nAdvocate General's Opinion of 15 March 2011, *European Commission v. Slovakia*, Case C-264/09 (RL-313), \u00b652. Article 10(1) of the ECT sets forth obligations for the promotion, protection and treatment of investments which include the commitment to accord at all times fair and equitable treatment and constant protection and security. Article 13(1) provides for guarantees against expropriation.\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent's contention that the objective test in Article 59 VCLT has been met in the present case; the provisions of the BIT and the ECT are not so incompatible that the two treaties cannot be applied at the same time.\n\n***(3) Is termination under Article 59 of the VCLT subject to the notification requirement of Article 65 of the VCLT?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusions regarding the application of Article 59 VCLT make it unnecessary to consider the Claimant's alternative argument based upon Article 65 VCLT.\n\n***(4) Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe conclusion of the Tribunal is that the two treaties \u2013 the BIT and the EC Treaty \u2013 do not have the same subject matter and can therefore be applied in parallel and be interpreted so as to be in harmony. Subsidiarily, the Tribunal finds that, even if the two treaties were to be considered to have the same subject matter, they still can be applied in parallel, first because no common intent to terminate the BIT can be ascertained either from the texts of the relevant treaties nor from the behaviour of the States Parties and secondly because far from being so incompatible as not being capable of being applied at the same time, they provide in some cases for very similar protections and even in cases where they differ \u2013 like for the procedures to obtain a remedy \u2013 they are complementary.\n\n237.\n\nThe same three-fold conclusion was reached by the tribunal in the *Eastern Sugar* case:\n\n*First*, the Arbitral Tribunal does not accept the Czech Republic's argument that the EU treaty as the later treaty (as between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands) covers the *same subject matter* as the BIT, the earlier treaty.\n\n\u2026\n\n*Second*, the Czech Republic has not established that the common *intention* of the Czech Republic and the Netherlands was that the EU Treaty would supersede the BIT.\n\n\u2026\n\n*Third*, the Arbitral tribunal is of the view that the BIT and the EU Treaty are *not incompatible*.252\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6\u00b6159, 167-168 (emphasis in original).\n\n238.\n\nThe overall conclusion of the Tribunal is therefore that the BIT has not been automatically terminated by application of Article 59 of the VCLT and has therefore to be considered as a treaty in force.253\n\nIt is interesting to note that this position concerning intra-EU BITs has not only been adopted in international arbitration, but also by national courts. It is noteworthy that the Czech courts have indeed confirmed, in the course of an unsuccessful challenge of the *Binder* decision, the existence of the BIT between the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and did not find any implied termination, stating to the contrary that \"the BIT is in the Appellate Court's view valid and effective, as it has so far been a component of valid legal orders of both states \u2026\" *See Czech Republic v. Binder*, *supra* note 190.\n\n**D. THE ISSUE OF THE APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 30(3) OF THE VCLT IMPLYING THE INAPPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe second strand of the first objection raised by the Respondent is that Article 8 of the BIT has to be considered inapplicable by virtue of Article 30(3) of the VCLT. According to Article 30(3) of the VCLT, when all the States Parties to an anterior treaty are also States Parties to a posterior treaty, and the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended by operation of Article 59 of the VCLT, the \"earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\" Article 30(4) of the VCLT adds that, \"[w]hen the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one, (a) as between States Parties to both treaties the same rule applies.\"254\n\nIn fact the pertinent rule in this case, as the parties to the BIT and to the ECT are not all the same, is Article 30(4), which refers to Article 30(3); but as both Parties have only discussed the application of Article 30(3), the Tribunal has used the same approach.\n\n240.\n\nUnlike Article 59 of the VCLT, Article 30(3) of the VCLT requires no proof of the States Parties' intention to terminate a particular provision and does not relate to the incompatibility of the treaties as a whole, but rather to the incompatibility of specific provisions.\n\n***1. The Positions of the Parties***\n-------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, under Article 30(3) of the VCLT, even if the BIT has not been terminated by application of Article 59 of the VCLT, at least Article 8 of the BIT must be deemed inapplicable as it is incompatible with EU law. The basis for such finding of incompatibility, according to the Respondent, is to be found in Articles 12 and 292 of the EC Treaty. Article 12 prohibits discrimination inside the EU on grounds of nationality and Article 292 prevents the submission of disputes between Member States to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein \u2013 arbitration not being referred to in the ECT.\n\n242.\n\nThis analysis of the Respondent has been strongly supported by the European Commission, which seems concerned to protect what could be described as the ECJ's monopoly over the interpretation and application of EU law. According to the EC, the EU is a system of integration, which implies that there must be a unique institution entrusted with the final word on what EU law means, and the existence inside the EU of arbitral tribunals dealing with the interpretation of EU law could jeopardise the uniform application of EU law.\n\n243.\n\nBoth the Respondent and the EC rely on Article 292 of the EC Treaty (now Article 344 TFEU) which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the ECJ to deal with disputes among Member States on the application of EU law in the following terms:\n\nMember States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Treaty to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.\n\nThe EC points to Opinion 1/09 delivered by the ECJ on 8 March 2011, which considered that the creation of a new Patent Court, to solve patent-related disputes between European private parties, was against the basic principles of EU law.255\n\nOpinion 1/09, *supra* note 121, \u00b6106.\n\n244.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent and the EC, the fact that the BIT grants a right to international arbitration on the basis of nationality is contrary to Article 12 of the ECT. Article 12 provides:\n\nArticle 12\n\nWithin the scope of application of this Treaty, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.\n\nThe Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, may adopt rules designed to prohibit such discrimination.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimant, for its part, considers that Article 344 TFEU is only applicable to disputes between States, as results from the plain wording of the text. Moreover, it considers that there is absolutely no rule or principle in EU law that prevents an arbitration between an EU investor and a Member State of the European Union. The Claimant also argues that the so-called discrimination between nationals of a EU Member State that can rely on international arbitration and others that cannot can be solved by extending this right to all, rather than depriving those who benefit from it under a BIT of this protection.\n\n***2. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal is not going to deal here with the issue of the general incompatibility of the two treaties which has already been dealt with above, but only with the possible incompatibility of Article 8 of the BIT with the ECT. The tribunal in *Eureko* has also rightly pointed to the difference of approach of the two articles, Article 59 and Article 30 (3):\n\nUnder Article 30 the test is whether the two successive treaty provisions are \"compatible.\" Under Article 59 the test is whether the provisions of the later treaty are \"so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\" Article 30 may be triggered by the slightest incompatibility between the provisions of the earlier and later treaties.256\n\n*Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6241.\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine successively whether Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with Article 292 of the ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) and/or with Article 12 of the ECT (now Article 18 TFEU).\n\n***(1) Does Article 8 of the BIT violate Article 292 of the ECT (Article 344 TFEU)?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Article 292 of the ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) does not provide for an absolute monopoly of the ECJ over the interpretation and application of EU law257 and does not prevent many other judicial or arbitral institutions from routinely dealing with EU law. The same conclusion was reached in *Eureko B.V. v. The Slovak Republic* :\n\nThe argument that the ECJ has an \"interpretative monopoly\" and that the Tribunal therefore cannot consider and apply EU law, is incorrect. The ECJ has no such monopoly. Courts and arbitration tribunals throughout the EU interpret and apply EU law daily. What the ECJ has is a monopoly on the final and authoritative interpretation of EU law: but that is quite different. Moreover, even final courts are not obliged to refer questions of the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ in all cases. The *acte clair* doctrine is well-established in EU law.258\n\nA similar conclusion was reached by the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in its Decision of 10 May 2012, when dealing with a request by the Slovak Republic to set aside the *Eureko* Award: \"[e]ven independent of the stipulation of Art. 344 TFEU, it cannot be assumed that the ECJ holds a monopoly on interpreting EU law.\" *See Frankfurt Court*, *supra* note 3, p. 22.\n\n*Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6282.\n\n249.\n\nThere are indeed numerous instances where EU law is applied outside the institutional and judicial framework of the European Union, and experience shows that there is no such thing as an absolute monopoly of the ECJ over the interpretation and application of EU law.\n\n250.\n\nIt is first not contested that *national courts and tribunals* are frequently called upon to interpret and apply EU law and their action in doing so is in no way incompatible with EU law, even when (as is most commonly the case) they are located in Member States of the EU which are subject to the requirements of Article 292 of the ECT (now Article 344 TFEU).\n\n251.\n\nAs far as the courts and tribunals of non-Member States are concerned, it is evident that they cannot turn to the ECJ to submit to it a question of interpretation of EU law, but this cannot mean that they are prevented from applying EU law, when under the choice of law rules such law is applicable. In other words, to take an example, an Argentinian tribunal, dealing with a dispute between an Argentinian company and a European company, might well have to apply a mandatory rule of EU law applicable to the dealings of the European company with non-EU companies. In such a case, this application cannot be controlled by the ECJ if there is no enforcement in Europe. As all of this takes place outside Europe, there seems to be no reason to require the intervention of the ECJ as an EU institution. However, if the award is susceptible of integration into the institutional and judicial framework of the European Union, *i.e.* if there is an attempt at enforcement in Europe through the relevant procedure, there may be the possibility of intervention by the ECJ if the enforcement raises questions of compatibility with EU law. In this case, the control by the ECJ is not a certainty: it depends on the willingness of the court of the Member State where enforcement is sought to submit a question of interpretation to the ECJ \u2013 and therefore it remains only a possibility.\n\n252.\n\nAs far as the courts and tribunals of the Member States are concerned, a certain uniformity of interpretation is without doubt rendered possible by their capacity (for any court or tribunal) and their obligation (for a court or tribunal of last resort under national law) to submit preliminary questions of interpretation of EU law to the ECJ by virtue of Article 234 of the EC Treaty (now Article 267 TFEU).259 But even in this situation, the ECJ does not have an absolute monopoly. The Tribunal stresses the fact that national courts have a certain degree of discretion in their decision to refer a question of interpretation to the ECJ, and that the courts of last resort may use the theory of the \" *acte clair* \" to maintain some discretion as well. In other words, there is no automatic seizure or *ex officio* seizure of the ECJ as soon as EU law is at stake, which leaves open, even if not very broadly, the possibility of divergent interpretations of EU law.\n\nArticle 267 (ex Article 234 ECT): \"The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:  \n (a) the interpretation of the Treaties;  \n (b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;  \n Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.  \n Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.\"\n\n253.\n\nSecondly, EU law is also routinely applied in *arbitration*, in other words, outside the institutional and judicial framework of the European Union. It is the Claimant's submission that, if the Respondent's analysis were to prevail, this would be the end of arbitration in the European Union, as underscored, for example, in the Claimant's observations on the *amicus curiae* briefs, where it stated that \"the logical culmination of the EU Commission's argument would be the end of arbitration within the EU.\"260 This is indeed inherent in the EC position as expressed in its Submission, where it argued that \"all natural and legal persons, as well as states that are directly or indirectly involved in the arbitration \u2026 are subject to and bound by the law of the European Union. All are therefore required to respect the primacy of European Union law as well as the autonomy of its judicial system.\"261\n\nClaimant's Comment, \u00b614.\n\nObservations of the European Commission, p. 2.\n\n254.\n\nAs far as arbitration is concerned, it appears that Article 344 TFEU (formerly Article 292 ECT) precludes arbitration between Member States regarding their obligations under EU law. This has indeed been decided by the ECJ in the *Mox Plant* case262, between the UK and Ireland, where the ECJ stated that EU Member States are prevented from submitting their disputes to \"any other method of dispute settlement\" than the ones provided for by EU law, and that the ECJ has exclusive jurisdiction in resolving a dispute between two EU Member States that is at least partially covered by EU law.\n\nCase C-459/03, *Commission v. Ireland*, Judgment of 30 May 2006, [2006] ECR I-4635 (CL-32).\n\n255.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not consider that this solution can be transposed to a case like the present one. There is no provision in the ECT, equivalent to Article 344 TFEU, dealing with arbitration between two or more private parties, nationals of Member States, or with the so-called mixed disputes settlement mechanisms like investment arbitration between individuals who are nationals of Member States and Member States. In other words, the principles set out in Article 292 (now Article 344 TFEU) are not applicable to these situations.\n\n256.\n\nConcerning arbitration between two private parties, it has been recognised by the ECJ that arbitrations between private parties, which apply EU law, are perfectly possible and are not in contradiction with any monopoly of interpretation of EU law by the ECJ, as illustrated for example in the *Eco Swiss* case.263 The main reason the ECJ did not find such arbitration objectionable was because the arbitration in that case, having been established in accordance with the rules of the Netherlands Arbitration Institute, was therefore placed under the control of the Dutch courts, which could seek the interpretation of the ECJ on the basis of Article 234 of the EC Treaty (now Article 267 TFEU). But in such a case, again, the same remark that was made concerning the decisions of national courts which are not compelled to refer to the ECJ is apposite.\n\n*Eco Swiss*, *supra* note 77. The ECJ has repeatedly held that arbitral tribunals are under an obligation to apply fundamental EU law. While the *Eco Swiss* case was decided in the context of competition law, the same position was adopted in the field of consumer rights, *see* for example, Case C-168/05, *Elisa Mar\u00eda Mostaza Claro v. Centro M\u00f3vil Milenium SL*, Judgment of 26 October 2006, [2006] ECR I-10421.\n\n257.\n\nConcerning arbitration between one Member State and nationals of another Member State \u2013 which is the situation encountered in the present case \u2013 it is the view of the Tribunal that it does not come under Article 292 of the EC Treaty (now Article 344 TFEU) and is therefore perfectly compatible with EU law.\n\n258.\n\nA first remark is that, even, if it were argued that the Member State cannot \"submit\" a dispute to arbitration with a private party, it is uncontested that Slovakia, being the Respondent in this case, has not \"submitted\" any dispute to this Tribunal. It has merely defended its positions against the claims of Euram Bank.\n\n259.\n\nMoreover, there is indeed no rule in EU law that forbids such a type of arbitration. In this case, an arbitration brought under the UNCITRAL Rules and seated in Stockholm, Swedish law applies as the *lex arbitri*, and the award rendered by this Tribunal is therefore placed under the control of the Swedish courts, which could, as shown specifically by the case of *Eco Swiss*, seek the interpretation of the ECJ on the basis of Article 234 of the EC Treaty (now Article 267 TFEU).\n\n260.\n\nIn fact, this position has been reiterated by the ECJ in other cases involving arbitral awards as has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal by the Claimant:\n\nIn at least two other cases that were referred to it by a Spanish and a Slovak court for a preliminary ruling at the stage of the enforcement of arbitral awards that had been rendered against consumers in their absence, the ECJ confirmed that national courts of EU Member States have to interpret EU law at the enforcement stage, thereby making clear once again that (i) arbitration is admissible even though arbitrators may have to apply EU rules and (ii) that national courts of EU Member states are not deprived of the power to refer matters for a preliminary ruling just because the dispute was decided by an arbitral tribunal rather than a court. Both cases involved the interpretation of Council Directive 93/13 EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts. The Spanish case264 concerned the issue of an unfair arbitration clause in a consumer contract. The Slovak case265 dealt with a potentially unfair penalty applied in an arbitral award rendered against a consumer.266\n\nCase C-40/08, *Asturcom Telecomunicaciones SL v. Cristina Rodr\u00edguez Nogueira*, Judgement of 6 October 2009 (CL-204).\n\nCase C-76/10, *Pohotovost' s.r.o. v. Iveta Kor\u010dkovsk\u00e1*, Order of 16 November 2010 (CL-205).\n\nClaimant's Comment, \u00b616.\n\n261.\n\nContrary to the arguments of the Respondent and the EC, the Tribunal considers that the analysis, according to which arbitration between private parties or a private party and a Member State is not contrary to EU law, is not contradicted by Opinion 1/09 of the Court (Full Court) of 8 March 2011267, an opinion delivered pursuant to Article 218(11) TFEU.268 That case can be distinguished on several accounts from the present situation. The question was whether the creation of a Patent Court (\" **PC** \") by an international agreement was contrary to the exclusivity of the EU courts:\n\n1. The request submitted for the Opinion of the Court by the Council of the European Union is worded as follows:\n\n\"Is the envisaged agreement creating a Unified Patent Litigation System (currently named European and Community Patents Court) compatible with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community?\"\n\nOpinion 1/09, *supra* note 121.\n\nArticle 218(11) TFEU (ex Article 300 ECT): \"11. A Member State, the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission may obtain the opinion of the Court of Justice as to whether an agreement envisaged is compatible with the Treaties. Where the opinion of the Court is adverse, the agreement envisaged may not enter into force unless it is amended or the Treaties are revised.\"\n\n262.\n\nOn the issue of whether Article 292 ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) applies to the mechanisms of the settlement of disputes involving private parties, the answer was unambiguously negative:\n\nNor can the creation of the PC be in conflict with Article 344 TFEU, given that that article merely prohibits Member States from submitting a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties. *The jurisdiction which the draft agreement intends to grant to the PC relates only to disputes between individuals in the field of patents*.269\n\nOpinion 1/09, *supra* note 121, \u00b663 (emphasis added).\n\n263.\n\nIt is true that, *in fine*, the ECJ considered the creation of the PC to be in violation of the monopoly of the ECJ, but this was the monopoly of rendering judgments, or at least having the last word, not only on the interpretation of the EC Treaty but also on the validity of decisions of the EU organs and institutions, provided for in Article 230 (now Article 263 TFEU)270, stating that \"the PC may be called upon to determine a dispute pending before it in the light of the fundamental rights and general principles of European Union law, or even to examine the validity of an act of the European Union.\" The difference between the PC and the present Tribunal was, quite rightly in the view of the Tribunal, argued by the Claimant.271 It is not alleged that, in the present case, the Tribunal is entrusted with a determination of the validity of an act of one of the European Union institutions. Another distinguishing factor between the PC and the present UNCITRAL arbitration is the impossibility of bringing infringement proceedings against the decisions of the PC, while it is possible to have infringement proceedings in the case of awards of arbitral tribunals constituted under the BIT like this Tribunal, at the stage of enforcement in the European Union.\n\nArticle 263 (ex Article 230 ECT): \"The Court of Justice of the European Union shall review the legality of legislative acts, of acts of the Council, of the Commission \u2026\"\n\nClaimant's Comment, \u00b621.\n\n264.\n\nIndeed, if a Member State were minded to enforce an arbitral award that would violate EU law, tools remain in the hands of the EU institutions \u2013 and particularly the ECJ \u2013 to ensure a proper application of EU law. The Tribunal considers it noteworthy to quote here Article 226 ECT (now Article 258 TFEU) and Article 228 ECT272 (now Article 260 TFEU):\n\nArticle 226\n\nIf the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity to submit its observations.\n\nIf the State concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the Commission, *the latter may bring the matter before the Court of Justice.*\n\nArticle 228 (1)\n\nIf the Court of Justice finds that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty, the State shall be required to take *the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice*. (emphasis added)\n\nThis Article was indeed cited in the Observations of the European Commission, at \u00b627: \"If a Member State does not comply with this obligation, the Commission can bring the matter directly before the European Court of Justice in accordance with Article 88 (2) EC. If the judgment of the Court of Justice is not complied with, the Court may impose pecuniary sanctions in accordance with Article 228 (2) EC.\"\n\n265.\n\nIn other words, even when cases are brought to arbitration, if they are to be enforced in the EU, the ECJ maintains the possibility, through different mechanisms, to have the final and authoritative word on the interpretation of EU law.273\n\nA similar conclusion was reached by the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in its Decision of 10 May 2012, when dealing with a request of the Slovak Republic to set aside the *Eureko* Award: \"It is therefore the view of the Senate that it is not the case that arbitration proceedings are entirely removed from the institutional and judiciary framework of the EU.\" Frankfurt Court Decision, *supra* note 3, p. 21.\n\n266.\n\nAs a last subsidiary remark, the Tribunal wishes to draw attention to the fact that EU law has indeed already been applied by arbitration tribunals, without raising any problems. To give just an example, in the *Maffezini* case, the arbitral tribunal interpreted and applied EU law in order to analyse the extent of the investor's rights, as can be seen from the following extract:\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the legislation on EIA. Strict procedures in this respect are provided in *EEC Directive* 85/337 of June 27, 1985 and in Spain's Royal Legislative Decree No. 1302/1986 of June 28, 1986.24 Chemical industries are specifically required under both measures to undertake an EIA. Public information, consultation with pertinent authorities, licensing and other procedures are also a part thereof. The *EEC Directive*, like the one that later came to amend it, requires \"that an EIA is undertaken before consent is given to certain public and private projects considered to have significant environmental implications.\" Suspension of projects can be ordered under Spanish law, particularly if work thereon is begun before the EIA is approved.274\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 (Award on the Merits, 13 November 2000), \u00b669 (emphasis added).\n\n267.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that, if the BIT and the ECT were considered as having the same subject matter, the application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT would not result in the inapplicability of Article 8 of the BIT, because of an incompatibility with Article 292 ECT (now Article 344 TFEU).275\n\nThe same conclusion was reached by the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in its Decision of 10 May 2012, when dealing with a request of the Slovak Republic to set aside the *Eureko* Award: \"The prevailing view in the commentaries and literature takes this to mean that Art. 344 TFEU only covers disputes between Member States. \u2026 In contrast \u2026 there is no source to be found that specifically holds the view that Art. 344 TFEU is also applicable to a dispute between a private individual and an EU Member State. \u2026 The possible risk of arbitral awards that contradict EU law, however, cannot constitute a direct application of Art. 344 TFEU to state/investor disputes per se. \u2026 The case law of the ECJ \u2013 insofar as apparent and submitted by the parties \u2013 does not provide any indication that Art. 344 TFEU would also apply directly to disputes between a Member State and an investor of another Member State, or that the general competence of investment tribunals was in question.\" Frankfurt Court Decision, *supra* note 3, pp. 18-20.\n\n***(2) Does Article 8 of the BIT violate Article 12 of the ECT (Article 18 TFEU)?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThis question might seem at first glance more difficult, as mentioned by the Claimant's expert, Professor August Reinisch: \"Under the EU legal regime the availability of remedies for only some EU nationals but not for all others may be problematic.\"276\n\nReinisch Opinion, \u00b660.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not possible to avoid this question by a mere statement that Article 8 of the BIT does not introduce any aspect of discrimination, as the *Binder* tribunal did when it stated:\n\nThe fact that, when there is a BIT, such national remedy is replaced or supplemented by an international arbitration mechanism does not, in the Arbitral Tribunal's view, involve any discrimination and is not otherwise incompatible with EC rules and principles.277\n\n*Binder v. Czech Republic*, *supra* note 227, \u00b665.\n\n270.\n\nThe question is indeed somewhat more complex, as recognised by the Claimant's expert, Professor Reinisch. However, Professor Reinisch immediately provides methods of resolving this seemingly problematic question. The first answer is that any possible discrimination might be taken up by the European institutions to sanction a Member State for violation of EU law, but that such discrimination has no consequence on the validity of the treaty under public international law: \"this is an internal EU law problem and not an issue of treaty compatibility.\"278 The Tribunal is convinced by this analysis.\n\nReinisch Opinion, \u00b660.\n\n271.\n\nMoreover, Professor Reinisch adds that it is for those suffering from discrimination to seek enforcement of their rights, by obtaining an extension of the favourable treatment granted in the Austria-Slovakia BIT to them:\n\nFurthermore, this consequence may be avoided by extending the favourable treatment accorded to BIT partners to all other EU Member States.279\n\nReinisch Opinion, \u00b660. A similar conclusion was reached by the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in its Decision of 10 May 2012, when dealing with a request of the Slovak Republic to set aside the *Eureko* Award : \"The Senate, in agreement with the arbitral tribunal, does consider it possible that an arbitration clause which only grants certain investors access to arbitration proceedings might violate the non-discrimination rule of EU law, yet this does not lead to the conclusion that the present claimant is denied access to an arbitral tribunal; for ultimately, a possible violation can only lead to an expansion of the rights of other investors as well, yet not to a restriction of the claimant's rights.\" Frankfurt Court Decision, *supra* note 3, p. 25.\n\n272.\n\nThe same idea was developed by other tribunals. Thus, the tribunal in *Eastern Sugar* stated:\n\nIf the BIT gives rights to the Netherlands and to Dutch investors that it does not give other EU countries and investors, it will be for those other countries and investors to claim their equal rights.\n\nIf the EU Treaty gives more rights than does the BIT, then all EU parties, including the \u2026 investors, may claim those rights. If the BIT gives rights to the \u2026 investors that it does not give other EU countries and investors, it will be for those other countries and investors to claim their *equal rights*.280\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Eureko* said that\n\nThere is moreover no reason, legal or practical, why an EU Member State should not accord to investors of all other EU Member States rights equivalent to those which the State has bound itself to accord to investors of its EU bilateral investment treaty partners \u2026281\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, *supra* note 22, \u00b6170 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Eureko*, *supra* note 21, \u00b6267.\n\n273.\n\nThis discrimination can also easily be remedied by the application of the EU principle of freedom of establishment, as mentioned by Austria in its submission, explaining that other EU nationals can put themselves in the same situation as Austrian nationals, and therefore benefit from the substantive and procedural protection of the BIT:\n\nFurthermore, other EU nationals enjoy the freedom of establishment. If they want to take advantage of the provisions of the Austro-Slovakian BIT for their investments in one of those States, they are free to organise their investment in a way that allows them to do so. The only precondition is to qualify as an investor in terms of the BIT, which can easily be achieved in exercising the freedom of establishment.282\n\nObservations of the Republic of Austria, p. 8.\n\n274.\n\nMore generally, the Tribunal considers that EU law does not exclude the existence of bilateral treaties giving some advantages to the nationals of the States Parties, *if these advantages are reciprocal*. The Tribunal can take inspiration here from the *\"D\"* case. In this case, under a bilateral tax treaty between the Netherlands and Belgium some tax advantages were granted to Belgian citizens which were not granted to German nationals under the bilateral tax treaty between the Netherlands and Germany. This appears on its face to be discrimination between German nationals and Belgium nationals, the same kind of discrimination as that said to exist in this case between the rights of investors benefiting from a BIT and those who do not benefit from such a BIT. On a reference from a Dutch court, the ECJ stated in its opinion, \"\u2026 the national court inquires whether, in light of the Treaty, the different treatment, in such a case, of a resident of Belgium and a resident of Germany is lawful.\"283\n\n*D. v. Inspecteur*, *supra* note 147, \u00b646.\n\n275.\n\nThe arguments of the parties, as summarised by the ECJ, were the following:\n\nMr D. submits that the difference, resulting from application of the Belgium-Netherlands Convention, between his situation and that of a resident of Belgium in an equivalent situation amounts to discrimination prohibited by the Treaty.284\n\n\u2026\n\nThe governments which have submitted observations and the Commission submit conversely that the different treatment of a person such as Mr D. and a resident of Belgium is not discriminatory. They argue that a Member State party to a bilateral convention is not in any way required, by virtue of the Treaty, to extend to all Community residents the benefits which it grants to residents of the Contracting Member State. Those governments and the Commission refer to the danger which the extension of the benefits provided for by a bilateral convention to all Community residents would entail for the application of existing bilateral conventions and of those which the Member States might be prompted to conclude in the future, and to the legal uncertainty which that extension would cause.285\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b647.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b648.\n\n276.\n\nAs explained by commentators on this decision, the governments which presented their views to the ECJ \u2013 the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany \u2013 as well as the European Commission considered that a finding of non-discrimination should be arrived at based on \"the concept that a Member State that is a party to a bilateral convention is not in any way required, by virtue of the EC Treaty, to extend to all Community residents the benefits that it grants to residents of the other contracting Member State.\"286\n\nG. Kofler and C. Philipp Schindler \"Dancing with Mr D: The ECJ's Denial of Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment in the \u2018D' case\" (2005) *European Taxation* 45(12) (RL-433), p. 537.\n\n277.\n\nThe ECJ considered that in the absence of European measures of harmonisation on the question dealt with in the relevant bilateral treaties and the absence as well of a multilateral treaty on the issue, it was left to the Member States to adopt bilateral treaties with reciprocal rights and obligations,287 causing the ones subject to one of these treaties to be considered as not being in the same situation than the ones subject to another treaty. Therefore, the ECJ did not consider this situation to be a violation of the principle of non-discrimination, on the basis of the idea that the rights in these treaties were fundamentally based on reciprocity, and could therefore not be compared:\n\nThe fact that those reciprocal rights and obligations apply only to persons resident in one of the two Contracting Member States is an inherent consequence of bilateral double taxation conventions. It follows that a taxable person resident in Belgium is not in the same situation as a taxable person resident outside Belgium so far as concerns wealth tax on real property situated in the Netherlands.\n\nA rule such as that laid down in Article 25(3) of the Belgium-Netherlands Convention cannot be regarded as a benefit separable from the remainder of the Convention, but is an integral part thereof and contributes to its overall balance.288\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b650-51: \"\u2026no unifying or harmonising measure for the elimination of double taxation had yet been adopted at Community level and that the Member States had not yet concluded any multilateral convention to that effect\u2026 In the absence of other Community measures or conventions involving all the Member States, numerous bilateral conventions have been concluded between the latter.\"\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b660-61.\n\n278.\n\nIt seems to the Tribunal that the exact same reasoning can be followed for the BITs which are based on reciprocal rights and obligations, with the result that the situation of the different investors cannot be compared.\n\n***(3) Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n279.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that, if the BIT and the ECT were considered as having the same subject matter, the application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT would not result in the inapplicability of Article 8 of the BIT, on the grounds of incompatibility with either Article 292 ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) or Article 12 ECT (now Article 18 TFEU).\n\n280.\n\nAs a general conclusion, the Tribunal reiterates that, in its view, the BIT and the ECT do not have the same subject matter, and as such coexist and are complementary in the international sphere, where they should be interpreted in harmony with one another. In addition, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that, if the BIT and the ECT were considered to have the same subject matter, the BIT would not be terminated under Article 59 of the VCLT, for lack of a common intention to terminate and for lack of incompatibility; neither, in such hypothesis, would the application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT compel the inapplicability of Article 8 of the BIT, as the Tribunal could trace no EU rule which would be violated by such application.289\n\nThis last conclusion was equally reached by the *Binder* tribunal, *supra* note 227, \u00b665: \"The Arbitral Tribunal does not find either that Article 10(2) of the Czech-German BIT, which provides for a specific procedural protection in the form of arbitration between the investor and the host State, is in conflict with EC Law.\"\n\n**E. THE ISSUE OF THE APPLICATION OF EU LAW AS LEX ARBITRI**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal turns to the final variant of the Respondent's EU objection, that based upon the relationship between EU law and the law of Sweden, where the Tribunal has fixed its seat in accordance with Article 16(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the rules of EU law on which it relies form part of Swedish law and therefore constitute part of the *lex arbitri.* According to the Respondent, it is a well-established principle of EU law that the supremacy of EU law must be recognized and given effect by the laws of all EU Member States. For example, the ECJ held in *Commission v. Italy* that \"[i]n matters governed by the EC Treaty, the treaty takes precedence over agreements concluded between the Member States before its entry into force.\"290\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6192, citing Case C-10/61 *European Commission v. Italy* [1962] ECR 1 (RL-67), \u00b6\u00b610, 23.\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the priority of EU law over incompatible pre-accession agreements concluded between Member States is one such rule. Therefore, the Respondent maintains that \"the conflict between the dispute settlement clause of the BIT and EU law can only be resolved by rendering Article 8 of the BIT inapplicable.\"291\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6191-95.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimant's characterisation of EU law and the Claimant's reliance on *AES v. Hungary* for the assertion that EU law should only be taken into account as fact, alleging instead that, in addition to operating as international law, EU law operates as part of Swedish law which constitutes the *lex arbitri*.292 The Respondent disputes the Claimant's reliance on *AES v. Hungary* for the assertion that EU law should only be considered as fact. Rather, the Respondent stresses that in *AES* *v. Hungary*, the parties both agreed that EU law should be considered as fact, so the tribunal did not concern itself with the international nature of EU law, but nevertheless did highlight the *dual* nature of EU law.293 Furthermore, the Respondent distinguishes *AES v. Hungary* since it is an ICSID case which is therefore not governed by the *lex loci arbitri*, unlike the present case which is one involving an *ad hoc* tribunal subject to Swedish arbitration law.294\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b656-60.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b657-59, citing *AES v. Hungary*, *supra* note 34.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b660.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this argument requires only a very brief response. The argument could only succeed if the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 8 of the BIT would be contrary to a rule of EU law. The Tribunal has already held, however, that there is no conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and EU law.\n\n286.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal considers that this final strand of the Respondent's intra-EU BIT objection must be rejected for the reasons it has already given in relation to the other strands of this objection.\n\n**F. CONCLUSION ON THE INTRA-EU BIT OBJECTION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nFor all the reasons explained in this Section devoted to the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal rules that the objection is dismissed.\n\n**III. THE DIFFERENT TRANSLATIONS OF THE TREATY**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe remaining jurisdictional objections all involve differences regarding the interpretation of the BIT. Those differences are complicated by the fact that the BIT is authentic in Czech and German and the Parties also disagree about the translation of the BIT into English. Before considering the remaining objections, therefore, the Tribunal must address the issue of translation.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimant initially relied upon a translation (\" **Exhibit C1** \") which was attached to its pleadings295 and was based upon the translation published in the UNTS.296 The Respondent objected that this translation was inaccurate and submitted its own certified translations from Czech (\" **Exhibit RL-40A** \") and German (\" **Exhibit RL-40B** \").297 While the Respondent maintained that there was no substantive difference between its two translations and referred to RL-40B in its submissions, it contended that, in accordance with the principles set out in Article 33 of the VCLT,298 questions of interpretation had to be resolved by reference to both texts and thus to both translations. The Claimant accepted, during the hearings, that \"C1\" was unsatisfactory in certain respects. The Tribunal therefore invited the Parties to agree upon a translation.299 After the hearings, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to so agree.\n\nAttached as Annex 4 to the Award.\n\nAttached as Annex 3 to the Award.\n\nAttached as Annexes 5 and 6 respectively. The original Czech and German texts are at Annexes 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nSee \u00b6323, below.\n\nTranscript (Hearing on Jurisdiction), Day 2, 20 Dec 2011, pp. 112-114.\n\n290.\n\nThe Claimant then tendered a new translation, attached as Annex 7 to this Award, which differed from both \"C1\" and, to a lesser extent, \"RL-40B\". The Respondent objects to the submission of a new translation at such a late stage. The Tribunal agrees that this late submission is less than optimal. Nevertheless, the Tribunal can derive jurisdiction only from the terms of the BIT which are authentic only in Czech and German. It cannot therefore exclude a translation which the Claimant now considers is a more accurate rendition of the two authentic texts.\n\n291.\n\nSince the differences between the Parties concern the four provisions most directly relevant to the remaining jurisdictional objections, namely Articles 1, 2, 4 and 8, the Tribunal (while mindful of the Respondent's comment about its translation \"RL-40A\"), sets out here the texts of the relevant parts of the two translations on which the Parties now rely, *i.e.* the Respondent's translation from German, \"RL-40B\" and the Claimant's post-hearing translation with the principal differences between the translations on which each Party finally relied highlighted.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ***Article 1: Definitions*** |\n| ***Respondent's translation from German*** ***(\"RL-40B\")*** | ***Claimant's post-hearing translation*** |\n| For the **purpose** of this Agreement: | For the **purposes** of this Agreement: |\n| (1) The term \"investment\" shall mean all assets **which an investor of one Contracting Party invests** in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation, in particular: | (1) The term \"investment\" shall mean all assets **that are invested by an investor of one Contracting Party** in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation, in particular: |\n| a) Movable and immovable property, as well as **any real rights** ; | a) Movable and immovable property, as well as **all rights in rem** ; |\n| b) shares and other forms of participation in enterprises; | b) Shares and other forms of participation in enterprises; |\n| c) claims **and** titles to money transferred to create an economic value, **and** claims to performance having an economic value; | c) claims **or** titles to money **that was** transferred to create an economic value, **or** claims to performance **s** having an economic value; |\n| d) rights relating to intellectual property, including copyrights, industrial property rights such as patents **and inventions**, trademarks, industrial designs, models and samples, technical processes, know-how, business names and goodwill; | d) Rights relating to intellectual property, including copyrights, industrial property rights such as patents, trademarks, industrial designs, models and samples, technical processes, know-how, business names and goodwill; |\n| e) concessions under public law for prospecting, mining or extracting of natural resources; | e) concessions under public law for prospecting, mining or extracting of natural resources; |\n| (2) \"Investor\" shall mean, in the case of the Republic of Austria: | (2) \"Investor\" shall mean, in the case of the Republic of Austria: |\n| b) any legal entity or partnership under commercial law established in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Austria, **having** its seat in the territory of the Republic of Austria, and **making** an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party; | b) any legal entity or partnership under commercial law **which was** established in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Austria, **has** its seat in the territory of the Republic of Austria, and **makes** an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party; |\n| (3) \"Earnings\" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment and includes, in particular, profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and license fees. | (3) \"Earnings\" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment and includes, in particular, profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and license fees. |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ***Article 2: Promotion and Protection of Investments*** |\n| ***Respondent's translation from German*** ***(\"RL-40B\")*** | ***Claimant's post-hearing translation*** |\n| (1) Each Contracting Party shall, **as far as** possible, promote investments made in its territory by investors from the other Contracting Party, shall permit such investments in accordance with its laws and shall accord them **fair** and equitable treatment.

SECOND OBJECTION: WHETHER EURAM'S CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF A QUALIFYING INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE TREATY**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent's second objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is that the dispute at issue does not fall within the scope of Article 8(1) of the BIT, because it does not arise out of an investment directly owned by the Claimant but rather out of a shareholding in Apollo which was owned not by the Claimant but by the Claimant's subsidiary EIC. Since EIC was incorporated in Slovakia, the Respondent maintains that the dispute falls outside the scope of Article 8(1). The Respondent argues that the BIT covers only investments which are directly made by an Austrian investor in Slovakia:\n\n\u2026 EURAM's claims do not arise out of a qualifying investment \u2013 the sine qua non for protection under the Treaty \u2013 but rather out of an investment made by its Slovak subsidiary. The Treaty's disputes clause does not cover claims arising out of indirectly-owned investments or investments made by host-country entities.300\n\nThe Respondent advances five arguments in support of this objection.301\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b67.\n\n*Ibid.*, Section IV.\n\n294.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the terms of the BIT, given their ordinary meaning, demonstrate that it was the intention of the States Parties to exclude claims based upon indirect ownership of investments. Citing Article 8(1) and 8(2) of the BIT, the Respondent maintains that the only disputes which may be submitted to investor-State arbitration under the BIT are those which \"arise out of an investment, between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party.\"302 According to the Respondent, \"investment\" is defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT as \"all assets which an investor of one Contracting Party invests in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation.\"303 The Respondent argues that investments covered by the BIT are thus limited so that \"the foreign investor must be the source of the investment in the territory of the State concerned, not a local company in which the investor has an interest.\"304 According to the Respondent, a tribunal would have jurisdiction \"over disputes arising out of an asset of an Austrian company invested in Slovakia. But it does not have jurisdiction over disputes arising out of assets invested in Slovakia by that Austrian investor's Slovak subsidiary.\"305 Additionally, the Respondent argues, the term \"assets\" referred to in Article 1(1) means assets \"owned by that investor, not assets owned by someone else.\"306 Article 1(2) of the BIT, in defining \"investor,\" further confirms that it is the entity with Austrian nationality that must \"make[] an investment in the territory of the [Slovak Republic].\"307\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6200-201; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6225 (no version specified).\n\nRespondent's translation (RL-40A), Annex 5.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6202; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6227-233.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6225.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6202-203.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6204-205.\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that its interpretation of the BIT is confirmed by the approach taken in a number of other arbitration awards, in particular the award in *HICEE BV v. Slovak Republic*, which concerned the Netherlands-CSFR BIT,308 and the award in *Berschader v. Russia,* which was made under the BIT between Belgium/Luxembourg and the USSR.309\n\nTranscript (Hearing on Jurisdiction), Day 1, 19 December 2011, pp. 62-71, citing *HICEE B.V. v. The Slovak Republic*, PCA Case No. 2009-11 (Partial Award and Dissenting Opinion, 23 May 2011) (RL-438) (hereinafter \" *HICEE* \").\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6229, 267, citing *Berschader v. Russia*, SCC Case No. 080/2004 (Award, 21 April 2006) (RL-56) (hereinafter \" *Berschader* \").\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent further refers to Article 4(3) of the Treaty, which provides as follows:\n\nIf a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is to be considered a company of such Contracting Party under Article 1 para. 2 of this Agreement and in which an investor of the other Contracting Party owns shares, the provisions of para. 1 above shall be applied in such a way as to ensure adequate compensation of such an investor.\n\nFor the Respondent, this provision demonstrates that the States Parties addressed indirectly-owned assets where they wished to do so.310 The Claimant's interpretation that all indirectly-owned investments would already be investments under Article 1(1), the Respondent argues, would render Article 4(3) purposeless, thereby violating the \"fundamental principle of effectiveness\" in treaty interpretation.311\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6234-241.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6237-240, citing *Asian Agricultural Products, Ltd (AAPL) v.

Poland* (Partial Award, 19 August 2005) (RL-155), \u00b6248.\n\n297.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent argues that general international law corroborates its argument that the BIT excludes claims based upon indirect ownership of investments.312 According to the Respondent, \"in the absence of a specific provision forming *lex specialis* in a treaty, the rules of customary international law govern matters such as shareholder standing and nationality of claims.\"313\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6207-216.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6207-216.\n\n298.\n\nIn support, the Respondent refers to the judgments of the International Court of Justice in *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo Case*.314 According to the Respondent, in those judgments, the ICJ reaffirmed the principle of distinct corporate personality in international law originally stated by the Court in the *Barcelona Traction* and *ELSI* cases,315 and explained that the rights and assets of a company must be distinguished from the rights and assets of a shareholder in that company.316 The Respondent maintains that these judgments state a general principle not confined to diplomatic protection.317\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Guinea v.

Sasson, *Substantive Law in Investment Treaty Arbitration* (2010) (RL-199), p. 131.\n\n300.\n\nThe Respondent also distinguishes Claimant's reliance on *Azurix v. Argentina* and *CMS v. Argentina*, arguing that they are \"unhelpful to the Claimant because the US-Argentina Treaty at issue in both those cases is precisely the kind of investment treaty that expressly allows investors to assert such indirect investment claims.\"319\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6253, citing *Azurix Corp v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 (Award, 23 June 2006) (CL-6) (hereinafter \" *Azurix* \"), *CMS Gas Transmission v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8 (Award, 12 May 2005) (CL-36) (hereinafter \" *CMS Gas Transmission* \").\n\n301.\n\nThirdly, according to the Respondent, the Treaty's limitation to directly-owned investments is confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, which it argues are relevant under Article 32 of the VCLT.320 The Respondent points to a report submitted by the Czechoslovak Federal Ministry of Finance together with the draft BIT with Austria for parliamentary approval, which states that the Treaty \"specifies the term \u2018investment' and \u2018investor' in connection with their participation in the business in the territory of one of the Contractual Parties.\"321\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6217; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6261.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6217, citing Annex II to the proposal for the negotiation regarding the agreement between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and Austria on the promotion and protection of investments and a proposal for the procedure related to the negotiation of similar agreements with other interested countries, No. FMF III/4-17,639/89 dated 17 October 1989 (R-4), \u00b69.\n\n302.\n\nFourthly, the Respondent submits that treaty practice under other investment treaties concluded by the Slovak Republic, Austria, and other States on indirect shareholder investment confirm that claims like the Claimant's are excluded under the Treaty.322 Discussing general treaty practice, the Respondent outlines three distinct approaches taken by States when electing to move away from the limitations of municipal and international law regarding the rights of indirect owners.323 The treaties either grant foreign-controlled local companies *jus standi,* make special provisions to allow shareholders to claim on behalf of a local corporation where they own or control the local corporation, or expressly extend access to arbitration for claims arising out of investments indirectly controlled or owned by the claimant.324 The Contracting Parties to the instant Treaty intentionally, the Respondent concludes, \"eschewed all three of these means.\"325\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6218-225; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6264.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6219-220.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6219-222.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6221.\n\n303.\n\nThe Respondent also discusses the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT, which were prepared at the same time as the Austria-CSFR BIT which make clear that the CSFR \"did not consider the indirect investments of a foreign investor through a local subsidiary to be international investments to be protected under investment treaties\" and was deliberate in its drafting so as to exclude them.326\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6224.\n\n304.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the exclusion of claims based on indirect ownership of investments is consistent with the Treaty's object and purpose. In this connection, the Respondent refers to three arbitration cases, *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic*, and *Berschader v. Russia*, for the argument that investment protection is but one of the aims of the Treaty, that investment treaties must be interpreted in a balanced manner, and that limitations on the coverage of indirect investors or the right to initiate an arbitration \"cannot be deemed contrary to the Treaty's object and purpose.\"327\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6227-229, citing *Saluka*, *supra* note 54, \u00b6300, *Austrian Airlines v.

The Claimant***\n---------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimant contests the Respondent's analysis of the issue and maintains that Euram Bank's investment is an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT.328 The Claimant maintains that the terms of the BIT, in their ordinary meaning, give a definition of assets which is \"broad in scope and capable of comprising both direct and indirect investments.\"329 The Claimant argues that \"Article 1(1) does not limit the investor in its discretion to decide what kind of asset he wants to invest\", nor how or by what means: \"[t]he only condition is that the investment needs to be \u2018 *in accordance with* [the Host State's] *legislation* '.\"330 The enumeration of examples of what may constitute an investment under Article 1(1) of the BIT is a non-exhaustive list.331 This \"broad, open-ended approach\" to defining investments is typical, the Claimant argues.332\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6111-173.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6113-114.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b691.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6119-122.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6120.\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent's reliance on Article 4(3) of the BIT, arguing that there \"is nothing in Article 4(3) that would indicate that it was intended to modify the definition of the term \u2018investment' as defined in Article 1.\"333 According to the Claimant, the fact that Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the BIT do not specifically refer to indirectly-owned investments also does not mean that these are not covered.334 Similar arguments were roundly rejected by the arbitration tribunal in *Siemens v. Argentina* under the Germany-Argentina BIT.335\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b699.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6102.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6102, citing *Siemens AG v.

Venezuela*, *Cemex Caracas Investments B.V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B.V. v. Venezuela*, *Siemens AG v. Argentina*, and *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*.336\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6123-133, citing *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings B.V. and ors v.

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal's task \"is an interpretative one, namely to determine whether the scope of the term \u2018 *investment'* is such as to comprise both direct and indirect investments.\"339\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6135.\n\n310.\n\nThe Claimant criticises the Respondent's reliance on *ADM, Loewen*, *Barcelona Traction*, *Diallo*, and *ELSI*, arguing that the reliance on these cases is misplaced as they do not address the same issues.340 Regarding *Loewen*, the Claimant submits that in that case the tribunal found that \"[t]here is no language in [NAFTA] which deals with the question of whether nationality must continue to the time of resolution of the claim. It is that silence in [NAFTA] that requires the application of customary international law.\"341 This is in contrast to the CSFR-Austria BIT, \"which is not silent on \u2018investment' and the mere necessity to interpret the term of a treaty must not be confused with \u2018silence' that calls for an analysis under customary international law. To the contrary, it prevents a reference to customary international law.\"342\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6138-146, citing *Archer Daniels Midland Company & Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v.

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nIn considering the Respondent's second objection, the Tribunal begins by noting that the principles which it must apply to its task of interpretation of the Treaty are those set out in Articles 31 to 33 of the VCLT:\n\nArticle 31: *General Rule*\n\n(1) A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n(2) The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n(3) There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n(4) A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\nArticle 32: *Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nArticle 33: *Interpretation of Treaties authenticated in Two or More Languages*\n\n(1) When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.\n\n(2) A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.\n\n(3) The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.\n\n(4) Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of Articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.\n\n316.\n\nSince the Tribunal has already decided (paragraph 81, above) that the VCLT is applicable to the BIT, these provisions govern the approach which the Tribunal must take to the interpretation of the BIT. It is, however, well established that these provisions state principles which are part of customary international law which would be applicable in any event.\n\n317.\n\nAs the Tribunal can derive jurisdiction only from the terms of the BIT, it must begin by considering the ordinary meaning to be given to those terms in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the BIT.\n\n318.\n\nAccording to Article 8(1) and 8(2) of the BIT, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, it must be faced with a dispute (1) between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, which (2) arises out of (or, in the Claimant's new translation, \"concerns\"351) an investment. There is no doubt that the first requirement is satisfied. Euram Bank is an investor of the Republic of Austria, within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the BIT, and it is in dispute with the Slovak Republic. The Respondent maintains, however, that the second requirement is not satisfied, because, in its view, the dispute does not arise out of an \"investment\" as that term is used in the BIT.\n\n*See* Chapter III, above. Nothing turns on the difference between \"arise out of\" in the Respondent's translation and \"concerning\" in the Claimant's new translation.\n\n319.\n\n\"Investment\" is defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT and the different translations of that provision relied upon by the Parties are set out at paragraphs 288 *et seq.*, above. The definition is in broad terms (the specific assets listed being only examples) and includes \"shares and other forms of participation in enterprises.\" However, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the issue is not what type of asset can constitute an investment but, rather, what link is required between that asset and the investor.\n\n320.\n\nIn the present case, the asset which was allegedly expropriated (or otherwise subjected to measures inconsistent with the BIT) is the shareholding in Apollo. The investor is Euram Bank. However, it was not Euram Bank but its subsidiary, EIC, which owned the shareholding in Apollo. Since EIC is a company incorporated in the Slovak Republic, it is not an investor which can claim against the Slovak Republic under the BIT. It follows that, if the BIT required that the asset be owned directly by the investor, that requirement would not be satisfied in the present case.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that the BIT requires that the investor be the direct owner of the asset. Article 1(1) makes no reference to ownership. Rather, it stipulates that \"the term \u2018investment' shall mean all assets which an investor of one Contracting Party invests in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation.\"352 This is broad language which is quite wide enough to encompass what is today the very common situation of a foreign company making an investment through a subsidiary incorporated in the host State. In the usage which was common in relation to investment by the time the BIT was concluded, an investor of State A which acquired control of a shareholding in a company incorporated in State B would be described as investing in the territory of State B irrespective of whether it had purchased the shares in its own name or arranged that they be purchased by a locally incorporated subsidiary whose decision-making it controlled. In the present case, there is no doubt that Euram Bank controlled the decisions made by EIC, which was its 100% owned subsidiary.353 Taking the words used in Article 1(1) of the BIT in their ordinary meaning, therefore, the Tribunal considers that they include the shareholding in Apollo, notwithstanding that those shares were owned by EIC rather than being directly owned by Euram Bank.\n\nTranslation RL-40B. The Claimant's new translation refers to \"assets which are invested by an investor of one Contracting Party.\" The Tribunal sees no substantive difference between the two translations.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b640.\n\n322.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, neither the context of those words, nor the object and purpose of the BIT compel a different conclusion. So far as the context is concerned, both Parties made extensive reference to Article 4(3) of the BIT (the text of which appears on page 93, above). According to the Respondent, this provision would be unnecessary if assets held through a subsidiary were included as investments under Article 1(1). On the Respondent's interpretation of the BIT, Article 4(3) stands alone as the only provision concerning indirectly owned assets, a category which Article 4(3) demonstrates is otherwise outside the scope of the BIT.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree. Article 4(3) has to be seen in the context of Article 4 as a whole. Article 4(1) provides that a Contracting Party may expropriate (or take similar measures with regard to) an investment of an investor of the other Contracting Party only if it pays compensation. Article 4(2) requires that the compensation correspond to the value of the investment immediately prior to the expropriation. Accordingly, if the investment in question is a factory, the measure of compensation is the value of that factory at that time. What Article 4(3) does is to make clear that where the foreign investor owns not the factory itself but a shareholding (even a very small one) in the local company which owns the factory \u2013 a company the majority of whose shares may well be owned by nationals of the expropriating State or other shareholders who could not qualify as investors under the BIT and who would therefore have no entitlement to compensation under that Agreement \u2013 adequate compensation must nevertheless be paid to that foreign investor. The term \"adequate compensation\" in this context would seem to require that the investor receive a proportion of the value of the asset relative to the proportion of his shareholding in the local company. The clarification provided by Article 4(3) in respect of such a case by no means compels the conclusion that assets held by a local subsidiary of which the investor owns 100% of the shares cannot constitute an investment under the terms of Article 1(1).\n\n324.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent's interpretation of Articles 1(1) and 4(3) would produce a curious result. Only disputes relating to something which qualifies as an investment under Article 1(1) may be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 8(1) and (2). Since the Respondent's interpretation of Article 4(3) is that it provides for a duty to compensate notwithstanding that there is no such investment, it would follow that a dispute regarding the arrangements for payment of compensation under Article 4(3) would not be subject to arbitration. Yet, as the Tribunal will explain below (at paragraphs 366-369), Article 4(5) suggests that any dispute regarding the amount of compensation and the method or conditions of its payment is intended to fall within the scope of Article 8.\n\n325.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the provisions for compensation in Article 4(3) do not suggest a narrower interpretation of Article 1(1).\n\n326.\n\nWith regard to the object and purpose of the BIT, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the object and purpose of the BIT is not such that it requires provisions which confer protection upon investors to be given the broadest possible interpretation in order to further the goal of investment protection. In particular, the Tribunal considers that it would not be justified in departing from the ordinary meaning of the terms of a definition provision on the basis that a more expansive definition of \"investment\" would further what is only one of the objects of the BIT. In the present case, however, the Tribunal has already concluded that the ordinary meaning of the terms used in Article 1(1) encompasses assets invested by an investor of the Republic of Austria in the territory of the Slovak Republic through a Slovak subsidiary owned by that investor. There is nothing in the object and purpose of the BIT which would suggest, let alone require, that the Tribunal accord a narrower interpretation to the language of Article 1(1).\n\n327.\n\nTurning to the Respondent's argument concerning customary international law, the Tribunal considers that this argument is based upon two propositions. The first, which relies upon the judgments of the International Court of Justice in *Barcelona Traction*, *ELSI* and *Diallo*,354 is that customary international law distinguishes between the assets of a company and those of its shareholders. The second, which is largely based upon arbitration awards such as those in *Loewen* and *ADM*,355 is that rules of customary international law continue to apply unless a treaty departs from them. The Tribunal does not consider that the authorities invoked by the Respondent sustain the conclusion that a dispute about an indirect investment falls outside the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n*See* \u00b6298, above.\n\n*See* \u00b6297, above.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the recent judgments of the International Court of Justice in *Diallo* amount to an authoritative reaffirmation of its earlier judgment in *Barcelona Traction*. Those judgments were, however, concerned with the extent of the right of diplomatic protection, where a State brings proceedings to protect one of its nationals. That was expressly stated by the Court in its 2007 Judgment in *Diallo*, where it said the following:\n\nThe Court is bound to note that, in contemporary international law, the protection of the rights of companies and the rights of their shareholders, and the settlement of the associated disputes, are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral agreements for the protection of foreign investments, such as the treaties for the promotion and protection of foreign investments, and the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which created an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and also by contracts between States and foreign investors. In that context, the role of diplomatic protection somewhat faded, as in practice recourse is only made to it in rare cases where treaty r\u00e9gimes do not exist or have proved inoperative. It is in this particular and relatively limited context that the question of protection by substitution might be raised. The theory of protection by substitution seeks indeed to offer protection to the foreign shareholders of a company who could not rely on the benefit of an international treaty and to whom no other remedy is available, the allegedly unlawful acts having been committed against the company by the State of its nationality. Protection by \"substitution\" would therefore appear to constitute the very last resort for the protection of foreign investments.356\n\n*Diallo*, *supra* note 314, \u00b688 (emphasis added).\n\n329.\n\nThe 2007 judgment determined that Guinea could not exercise diplomatic protection with regard to the companies in which Mr Diallo held a controlling interest, because those companies were incorporated in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In its 2010 judgment in *Diallo*, the Court went on to hold that, in exercising its right of diplomatic protection with regard to Mr Diallo, Guinea could not recover in respect of acts which, though they may have violated obligations owed to the companies, did not amount to violations of the rights of Mr Diallo as *associ\u00e9*.\n\n330.\n\nThe Respondent also referred to the judgment of the International Court in *ELSI*, which it denied was a case of diplomatic protection. The Tribunal does not believe that this judgment has any bearing on the issues in the present case. Since it was an action brought by the United States on behalf of two United States companies,357 albeit by reference to a Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty, it was a diplomatic protection case. Moreover, it did not turn on questions relating to indirect investment but was concerned with the application of the local remedies rule and the scope of protection under the treaty, neither of which issues is relevant to the present case.\n\n*ELSI*, *supra* note 315, \u00b651.\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal is not concerned with the \"particular and relatively limited context\" of diplomatic protection. The issue in the present case is not whether Austria may exercise a right of diplomatic protection with regard to the alleged expropriation of EIC's shareholding in Apollo, nor whether, if Austria exercised its right of diplomatic protection with regard to Euram Bank, it could recover damages in respect of the alleged expropriation of that shareholding. The issue in the present case is whether that shareholding falls within the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT. The BIT constitutes *lex specialis* in that regard.\n\n332.\n\nNor does the Tribunal find the passages in the *Loewen* and *ADM* awards on which the Respondent relied to be relevant to the present case. Those awards (like the judgment in *ELSI*) show that where a treaty is silent on a subject it cannot be presumed to have departed from an established rule of customary international law such as the local remedies rule (*ELSI*) or the doctrine of continuing nationality (*Loewen*). But that is not the case here. The BIT creates a right of action for an investor which would not exist under customary international law. It does so in respect of disputes about \"investments\", a term which the BIT defines in some detail in Article 1(1). There is no general rule of customary international law which would normally be applicable in this situation and on which the BIT is silent.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal will next turn to the question of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the BIT. In view of the Tribunal's findings regarding the meaning of Article 1(1), it has doubts about whether this is a case in which recourse to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* is appropriate under Article 32 VCLT.358 The Tribunal considers, however, that, even if it were to have recourse to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the BIT, doing so would not affect the outcome. The Tribunal finds nothing in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* which have been put before it that compels the conclusion that the States Parties intended that the BIT should define investment so as to exclude indirectly owned investments of the kind at issue in the present case. The Respondent relied upon a brief statement in a Report submitted to the Government of the then CSFR by its Ministry of Finance to the effect that the proposed agreement with Austria \"specifies the terms \u2018investment' and \u2018investor' in connection with their participation in the business in the territory of one of the Contractual Parties\".359 This statement reveals nothing about the manner of that participation nor about whether it had to be direct or could be made through a locally incorporated subsidiary.\n\nThe tribunal in *Methanex v. United States* considering the 1966 Report of the International Law Commission to the General Assembly stressed the limited relevance of the negotiating history in the light of Article 31 of the VCLT:  \n [\u2026] pursuant to Article 32, recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation only in the limited circumstances there specified. Other than that, the approach of the Vienna Convention is that the text of the treaty is deemed to be the authentic expression of the intentions of the parties; and its elucidation, rather than wide-ranging searches for the supposed intentions of the parties, is the proper object of interpretation. (*Methanex Corp. v. United States*, Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005, Part II, Chapter B, \u00b622)\n\nAnnex II to the proposal for the Negotiation regarding the agreement between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and Austria on the promotion and protection of investments and a proposal for the procedure related to the negotiation, No. FMF III/4-17/639/89, 17 October 1989 (R-4), p. 5.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the tribunal in *HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, a case which was also concerned with the Slovak Republic's change to the law regarding health insurers and related to that part of the shares in Apollo which was not held by EIC, relied on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT in arriving at the conclusion that indirectly owned assets did not fall within the definition of investment in that treaty. Despite the similarity between the underlying facts of that case and the present proceedings, however, the legal materials are quite different. Not only was the relevant provision of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT in different terms from those of the BIT at issue here (a matter to which the Tribunal will return below), the *travaux* presented to the *HICEE* tribunal contained a passage which was far more explicit than that quoted in the preceding paragraph.\n\n335.\n\nThe *HICEE* tribunal relied upon the following passage in the Explanatory Note submitted by the Dutch Government to the Parliament of the Netherlands regarding the proposed BIT between the Netherlands and the CSFR:\n\nThe Agreement covers direct investments and investments made through a company in a third country. Normally, investment protection agreements also cover investments in the host country made by a Dutch company's subsidiary which is already established in the host country (\"subsidiary\"-\"sub-subsidiary\" structure). Czechoslovakia wishes to exclude the \"sub-subsidiary\" from the scope of this Agreement, because this is in fact a company created by a Czechoslovakian legal entity, and Czechoslovakia does not want to grant, in particular, transfer rights to such company. This restriction can be dealt with by incorporating a new company directly from the Netherlands. As the restriction is therefore not of great practical importance, the Dutch delegation has consented to it.360\n\nThere is no statement of similar clarity in the *travaux* of the Austria-CSFR BIT with which the present case is concerned.\n\n*HICEE*, *supra* note 308, \u00b638.\n\n336.\n\nNor does the Tribunal find the practice in respect of other treaties relied upon by the Respondent to be of any assistance. The fact that the Slovak Republic (and its predecessor States) was concerned to limit the scope of investments covered in other treaties and inserted restrictive language to that effect (as was done in the Netherlands BIT) serves, if anything, to highlight the absence of such restrictive language in the present BIT. The practice of other States seems to the Tribunal to shed no light whatsoever upon the intention of the States Parties to the present BIT.\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the way in which the issue of indirect ownership has been dealt with by other arbitral tribunals. In this context, both Parties invoked awards which they considered supported their favoured interpretation. The Tribunal believes that such awards have to be approached with a degree of caution. In several instances, the BIT under consideration used language which was different from that of the present BIT and the award is, therefore, of no assistance. For example, the award in *HICEE*, on which the Respondent relied, concerned a clause which was very similar to Article 1(1) of the current BIT in defining \"investment\", except that it included a provision that the asset had to be \"invested either directly or through an investor of a third State.\" Given that language, it is not surprising that the tribunal held that a structure similar to the one employed by Euram Bank and EIC in the present case was excluded, since the asset in question was invested neither directly nor through an investor of a third State.361 Article 1(1) of the present BIT, however, contains no statement that the asset in question must be \"invested either directly or through an investor of a third State.\" Conversely, a number of the awards relied upon by the Claimant concerned BITs which expressly included indirectly owned assets within their definition of investment, whereas no such provision appears in the present BIT.\n\n*Berschader*, *supra* note 309, on which the Respondent relied, also contained an express provision regarding investment made through a company incorporated in a third State. The tribunal there concluded that an investment made through a company incorporated in the State of nationality of the claimant, but which was not a party to the proceedings, was excluded.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that in a number of cases tribunals confronted with clauses similar to that in the present case have held that they include indirectly owned assets. For example, in *Siemens v. Argentina*, the BIT between Germany and Argentina defined \"investment\" as\n\nall kinds of assets in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the capital investment is made in accordance with this treaty, in particular, but not exclusively [\u2026] (b) shares of corporate stock, shares in companies and other kinds of participations in companies.362\n\nThe tribunal came to the conclusion that \"the quality of a direct dispute is not affected by Siemens not being the direct shareholder of the local company.\"363\n\nGermany-Argentina BIT, Article 1.\n\n*Siemens*, *supra* note 335, \u00b6150.\n\n339.\n\nIn considering the scope of a similar clause, the tribunal in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* stated the matter even more clearly:\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investments in the BIT. The definition of investment given in Article 1 is very broad. It includes \"every kind of assets\" and enumerates specific categories of investments as examples. One of those categories consists of \"shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures\". The plain meaning of this provision is that shares or other kind of interests held by Dutch shareholders in a company or in a joint venture having made investment on Venezuelan territory are protected under Article 1. The BIT does not require that there be no interposed companies between the ultimate owner of the company or of the joint venture and the investment. Therefore, a literal reading of the BIT does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.364\n\n*Mobil*, *supra* note 336, \u00b6165.\n\n340.\n\nThe tribunals in *Cemex Caracas v. Venezuela*, *Ioannis Karadassopoulos v. Georgia*, *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru* and *Mobil v. Venezuela* also dealt with the coverage of indirect investments by applying a broad investment definition within the respective BITs. The tribunals all came to similar conclusions, namely that indirect investments were covered by the respective clauses. The Tribunal considers that these awards serve to confirm the conclusion it had already reached regarding the interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection.\n\n**V. THIRD OBJECTION: THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE 8**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nThe Respondent's third jurisdictional objection is that the Claimant's claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT fall outside the scope of Article 8, from which the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction. The Respondent's submissions and the Claimant's response thereto raise three issues which the Tribunal will address separately.\n\n343.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the terms of Article 8 limit jurisdiction to two types of dispute: (a) those regarding the amount, or conditions of payment, of compensation in the case of expropriation or similar measures under Article 4, and (b) those concerning the right to free transfers under Article 5. The Respondent therefore contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in the present case with regard to the claims under Article 4, since the dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent is not over the amount or conditions of payment of compensation for expropriation but concerns the more fundamental question whether there has been an expropriation, or similar measure. According to the Respondent, Article 8 does not confer jurisdiction over that question. The Respondent also maintains that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims under Article 2 for alleged breaches of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, since disputes over that obligation are not mentioned in Article 8. The Respondent accepts that this third jurisdictional objection does not apply to the claims under Article 5 of the BIT. The Claimant disputes the Respondent's interpretation of Article 8, so far as it concerns its claims under Article 4 of the BIT (although it accepts that its claims under Article 2 fall outside the terms of Article 8 if those terms are considered in isolation). This issue is addressed in Part A, below.\n\n344.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant raises a separate issue by contending that, even if the Respondent's interpretation of Article 8 is correct, the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic has already decided, in its judgment of 24 March 2011, that the shareholding in Apollo was the subject of expropriation or similar measures falling within Article 4(1). Consequently, it contends that the way is clear for the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction under Article 8 to decide the dispute regarding compensation for what has already been established as an expropriation. The Respondent disputes the Claimant's analysis of the meaning and effect of the judgment of the Constitutional Court. This argument does not affect the claims under Article 2. The judgment of the Constitutional Court is considered in Part B, below.\n\n345.\n\nFinally, the Claimant maintains that, even if the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's interpretation of Article 8 and rejects the Claimant's argument regarding the judgment of the Constitutional Court, its jurisdiction is nevertheless established. According to the Claimant, the effect of the most favoured nation (\" **MFN** \") clause in Article 3 of the BIT is that the Claimant may take advantage of the broader jurisdictional provisions in other BITs concluded by the Slovak Republic and its predecessor State. On this basis, the Claimant maintains that the Tribunal has jurisdiction not only over its Article 4 claims but also over its claims under Article 2 of the BIT. The MFN issue is addressed in Part C, below.\n\n**A. THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 8**\n--------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Positions of the Parties***\n-------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Respondent***\n------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent bases its argument that the Claimant's claims for violation of Articles 2 and 4 of the Treaty do not fall within the scope of Article 8 of the Treaty on the \"text, context, object and purpose, and the circumstances of the conclusion and the preparatory work of the Treaty.\"365 According to the Respondent, Article 8 is \"plain on its face\" and demonstrates that Slovakia has not agreed to arbitrate claims under Article 4, except in respect of the amount, or conditions of payment, of compensation, or any matter under Article 2.366\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6236, 239.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6238.\n\n347.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Article 8 of the BIT confers jurisdiction only with respect to disputes \"concerning the amount or the conditions of payment of a compensation pursuant to Article 4, or the transfer obligations pursuant to Article 5.\"367 According to the Respondent, the use of the word \"concerning\" shows that expropriation claims are confined to the issue of the \"amount or the conditions of payment of a compensation\"368 and excludes the questions whether there has been an expropriation or other similar measure and, if so, whether that measure was contrary to the requirements of Article 4(1) regarding matters other than compensation.369 According to the Respondent, the finding of whether an expropriation has occurred and the finding of the amount of compensation are divisible and can be reviewed separately.370\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6242-243.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6243.\n\n*Ibid.*, Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6292-299.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6310.\n\n348.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this interpretation of Article 8 is strengthened when the provision is viewed in the context of the other provisions of the BIT, in particular, the title of Article 4 and the text of Article 4(4) and 4(5). The Respondent contends that Article 4(4) and 4(5) establish a \"division of responsibility.\"371 Article 4(4) permits a claimant to litigate the \"legitimacy/legality\" of an expropriation in the Slovak courts, but \"does not contemplate access to an arbitral tribunal for a determination of lawfulness.\"372 Article 4(5) allows an arbitral tribunal to review \"the amount of compensation and conditions of payment\", but nothing in Article 4(5) \"suggests that arbitral review may go beyond \u2018the amount of the compensation and conditions of payment'.\"373 The Respondent also places reliance on the phrase \"pursuant to Article 4\" in Article 8(1), which, it contends, ties the grant of jurisdiction under Article 8 to the division of responsibility laid down in Article 4(4) and 4(5). The Respondent notes that the decision of the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal \"unreservedly, and unanimously endorsed the above textual analysis.\"374\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6248; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction \u00b6317.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6248.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6249.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6250-251, citing *Austrian Airlines*, *supra* note 327, \u00b697.\n\n349.\n\nPointing to the VCLT, the Respondent argues that the object and purpose of the Treaty and the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* further deny the existence of consent to the arbitration of expropriation claims.375 The Respondent considers that the Treaty's preamble is narrow as compared with other BITs,376 and in any event notes that \"the object and purpose cannot be used to add words to the text of the Treaty.\"377 Additionally, the Respondent cites a previous draft of Article 8(2) to point out that the Contracting Parties restricted the scope from \"related claims\" to \"specified claims.\"378 According to the Respondent, this indicates a \"deliberateness in narrowing the jurisdictional clause\" and \"reflects an undeniable intention not to extend jurisdiction beyond the limited scope of the text of Article 8.\"379\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6253-260.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6253, citing *cf.* US-Ecuador BIT signed on 27 August 1993, entry into force 11 May 1997 (RL-54).\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6256, citing *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 (Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005) (RL-222), \u00b6193 (hereinafter \" *Plama* \").\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6257-258, citing Annex III, Proposal for the negotiation regarding the agreement between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and Austria on the promotion and protection of investments, No. FMF III/4-17,639/89, dated 17 October 1989 (R-5).\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6257-260.\n\n350.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the States Parties' compliance with Article 4(4), and the Claimant's arguments regarding the effectiveness of the Slovak Courts is not relevant to interpreting Article 8(1).380 The Respondent argues that even if compliance with Article 4(4) were relevant, the Claimant has not met the burden of demonstrating non-compliance.381 The Respondent points to several remedies available to the Claimant under Slovak law that \"allow foreign investors to obtain a determination that an expropriation has occurred within the meaning of the Treaty.\"382 According to the Respondent, the Slovak Constitution enables foreign investors to bring their claims, and the courts of general jurisdiction would entertain four different actions under national statutes.383 The Respondent also refers to the fact that the Claimant has initiated proceedings before the District Court of Bratislava, thus demonstrating that it considers there are remedies available to it under the laws of Slovakia.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6332-336.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6337.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6347.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6349-358.\n\n***(2) The Claimant***\n----------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimant begins by noting that its case under Article 4 is that its investment was the subject of indirect expropriation. In arguing that the Treaty covers more than just disputes over the amount of compensation, the Claimant takes issue with the Respondent's translation of Article 8(1) of the BIT.384 The Claimant argues that the correct translation, as set out in the translation which it filed after the hearing, does not contain the words \"pursuant to.\" For the Claimant, while \"the use of the words \u2018 *the amount \u2026 of (a) compensation* ' seemingly limits the scope of the arbitration, [t]he words \u2018 *concerning* ' or \u2018 *with regard to* ', however, are broad.\"385 In particular, the Claimant takes issue with the Respondent's characterisation of \"concerning\" as a narrowing term similar to \"about.\"386\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6237-245.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6242-244 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6129.\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the ordinary meaning of the words in Article 8 and the crossreferences made to Article 4 demonstrate that jurisdiction is not confined to disputes over the amount of compensation.387 Instead, the Claimant submits, the Tribunal is empowered to consider whether an event enumerated in Article 4(1) of the BIT has occurred and its precise nature. The contrary conclusion would deprive Article 8 of the BIT of purpose and meaning since then \"[a] state could defeat investment arbitration merely by asserting that no expropriation had taken place and that would be the end of the matter for any investor and tribunal.\"388\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6247.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6247-248.\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the relevance of Article 4(4) of the BIT for the interpretation of Article 8 of the Treaty. While Article 4(1) of the BIT covers \"nationalization\" and other \"measures having similar consequences\" as well as \"expropriation\", Article 4(4) only mentions \"expropriation\". The Claimant's claims, which arise *inter alia* from \"measures having similar consequences\", thus fall within the ambit of Article 8 of the BIT, which refers generally to all compensable events under Article 4 but are not encompassed by Article 4(4), which deals only with \"expropriation.\"389\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6152.\n\n354.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant argues that Articles 4(4) and (5) of the BIT provide for a right to domestic court review, but \"the fact that the Treaty contains a specific right to challenge some aspects of expropriation before national authorities does not imply that this presents a system according to which some disputes should be settled before national authorities and others before international arbitration.\"390\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6150.\n\n355.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this interpretation is consistent with the cases of *EMV*, *Renta 4*, *Sedelmayer v. Russian Federation*, *Telenor v. Hungary*, and *Tza Yap Shum v.* *Republic of Peru*, in which tribunals either found that they had jurisdiction in situations with narrow BITs, or at least interpreted similar BITs to allow a tribunal to consider not just compensation claims but also expropriation claims.391\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6250-268; Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6120-126, citing *EMV v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nIn accordance with the principles already set out (in paragraphs 315-317, above), the Tribunal begins by considering the \"ordinary meaning\" of the terms used in Article 8 of the BIT. In doing so, it focuses only on the treatment of disputes regarding Article 4 of the BIT, since it is common ground that disputes regarding Article 5 claims are within the scope of the provision.403\n\n*See*, Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b68; Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6233-236.\n\n362.\n\nThe critical words are those in Article 8(1) which define the type of dispute over which Article 8(2) gives an arbitration tribunal jurisdiction. According to the Respondent's translation,404 Article 8(1) requires that the dispute must be one \"concerning the amount or the conditions of payment of a compensation pursuant to Article 4.\" The Claimant's post-hearing translation is that the dispute must be one \"with regard to the amount or the arrangements for payment of compensation in accordance with Article 4.\"\n\n*See* p. 95, above.\n\n363.\n\nThe words used in this part of Article 8(1) clearly limit the scope of that provision, which is thus rendered far more restrictive than the disputes clauses found in many BITs. The Parties are agreed on that much and the Claimant does not suggest, for example, that the wording of Article 8(1) could embrace its claim for a violation of Article 2 of the BIT unless the Tribunal accepts its MFN argument. Unless it is to be read as modified by the effect of the MFN provision, Article 8(1) plainly confines the Tribunal to disputes regarding Articles 4 and 5. The question, however, is whether it is more restrictive than that and denies the Tribunal jurisdiction to determine whether there has been an expropriation or other act falling within Article 4(1).\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that any significance attaches, for present purposes, to the differences between the translations proffered by the Parties and set out at page 95, above. Whether the provision is correctly translated as referring to \"conditions of payment\" or \"arrangements for payment\" has no relevance to the issue before the Tribunal. Nor does the question whether the indefinite article should appear before the word \"compensation.\" The other two differences require a little more attention. The Respondent places some reliance on the word \"concerning\", arguing that it has a limitative effect. However, the Tribunal considers that it is no more (and no less) limiting than \"with regard to\" and that the two expressions are, for practical purposes, synonymous in the present context. It has come to the same conclusion regarding the terms \"pursuant to\" and \"in accordance with\".\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, even if it treats as definitive the most recent translation offered by the Claimant, the interpretation advanced by the Respondent more accurately reflects the ordinary meaning of the words used. According to the Claimant's translation, Article 8(1) gives jurisdiction only over a dispute \"with regard to the amount or the arrangements for payment of compensation pursuant to Article 4.\" The language is narrow and specific. It is in marked contrast to the equivalent provision in the BIT concluded only eighteen months earlier between the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union and the CSFR, which was considered by the tribunal in the case of *EMV v. Czech Republic* (the award in which is discussed below). Article 8 of that BIT provided for an arbitral tribunal to have jurisdiction over disputes \"concerning compensation due by virtue of\" the provisions equivalent to those of Article 4 of the present treaty. That provision was held to confer jurisdiction over the issue whether an expropriation or similar measure had occurred so as to give rise to a right to compensation. Article 8(1) of the present treaty specifies that the dispute must be about not simply \"compensation\" but \"the *amount* or the *arrangements for payment* of compensation.\" If the intention had been to confer upon an arbitral tribunal established under Article 8 the jurisdiction to determine whether there was any entitlement to compensation at all, it is difficult to see why the words \"the amount or the arrangements for payment\" were included; the Claimant's interpretation of Article 8(1) effectively renders those words redundant and, in doing so, runs counter to the principle of treaty interpretation that all words used should, if possible, be given meaning.\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent also differ over whether the words \"in accordance with Article 4\" qualify the term \"compensation\" or the whole phrase \"the amount or the arrangements for payment of compensation.\" The Claimant argues that the qualification relates to the word \"compensation\" and thus directs the reader to the basic entitlement to compensation in Article 4(1), which, so the Claimant contends, means that an Article 8 tribunal is given jurisdiction to rule on whether or not the conditions in Article 4(1) have been met. The Respondent argues that the qualifying words refer to the whole phrase \"the amount or the arrangements for payment of compensation\". The Tribunal finds the Respondent's analysis more persuasive. The structure of Article 8(1) is such that the phrase \"in accordance with Article 4\" would most naturally be seen as referring to the whole of what precedes it; there is no grammatical or logical reason for singling out the word \"compensation\" from the remainder of the phrase in which it appears.\n\n367.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that \"in accordance with\" should be given the same meaning as \"due by virtue of\". As the arbitral tribunal in *Renta 4 v. Russian Federation* (an award on which the Claimant relied) said, the latter phrase necessarily raises the question \"who determines whether compensation is indeed \u2018due'.\"405 The Tribunal is not persuaded that the two phrases carry the same meaning. To say that compensation is due by virtue of a provision is a clear reference to the existence of an entitlement to compensation derived from that provision. The term \"in accordance with\" does not have the same clear reference to entitlement; it is more commonly used as synonymous with \"pursuant to\" or \"according to\" (the other translations offered in respect of this part of Article 8(1)) and thus acts in large part as a cross-reference. In the context of the present BIT, the phrase \"in accordance with Article 4\" also seems more naturally to tie the provisions of Article 8(1) in with those of Article 4(5), which provides (again using the Claimant's latest translation) as follows:\n\nThe investor shall have the right to have the amount of the compensation and the method of payment reviewed either by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party which prompted the expropriation or by an arbitral tribunal *in accordance with Article 8 of this Agreement*. (Emphasis added)\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the italicised words and the use in Article 8(1) of the phrase \"in accordance with Article 4\" were intended to create a close relationship between the two provisions. Under that relationship, the only type of dispute regarding Article 4 in respect of which Article 8 confers jurisdiction upon an arbitration tribunal is the type of dispute which Article 4 expressly provides may be referred to such a tribunal, *i.e.* those contemplated by Article 4(5).\n\n*Renta 4*, *supra* note 391, \u00b627.\n\n368.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the VCLT requires that the terms of a treaty be interpreted in their context. In the present case, the most important part of the context of Article 8 is Article 4, to which Article 8(1) makes express reference. The Tribunal has already considered several aspects of Article 4, but one more requires attention. Article 4(4) provides that an investor shall have the right to have the \"legality\"406 of an expropriation reviewed by the national authorities; no reference is made to review of that question by any other body. By contrast, Article 4(5), as has already been seen, gives the investor the right to have the amount of compensation and the arrangements for paying it reviewed by either the national authorities or an Article 8 tribunal. According to the Respondent, Article 4(4) and 4(5), read together, confirm the comparatively limited role which the Parties to the BIT intended to give to an arbitral tribunal established under Article 8.\n\nThe Respondent's translation refers to \"legitimacy.\" The Tribunal does not consider that the difference between these two terms has any significance for the issues currently under consideration.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimant seeks to counter this apparent effect of Article 4(4) and 4(5) in a number of ways. First, it maintains that Article 4(4) applies only to \"expropriation\" and not to the other types of measure referred to in Article 4(1). It sees that fact as possessing particular significance, because its argument on the merits is that the present case is one of indirect taking and not of classic \"expropriation.\" The Tribunal does not agree that Article 4(4) is limited in the way suggested by the Claimant. It notes that the Respondent's translation of Article 4(1) refers to \"expropriation measures, *including* nationalization or other measures having the same consequences.\" Whether that is in fact a more accurate rendition into English of the authentic texts of Article 4(1), it undoubtedly reflects the overall approach of Article 4. The terms \"expropriation\" or \"expropriation measures\" are used in paragraphs (2) to (5) of Article 4 in such a way that they are plainly intended to encompass all of the types of measures referred to in Article 4(1). Thus, the provisions for the amount and arrangements for payment of compensation in Article 4(2) are applicable to all \"expropriation measures.\" If the Claimant's analysis were correct, then neither Article 4(2) nor Article 4(3) (a provision on which the Claimant relies in other parts of its argument) would be applicable to the type of measure of which it claims to have been the victim.\n\n370.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant maintains that Article 4(4) is intended to apply only to measures taken with regard to specific property under powers granted by a statute or similar legislation of general application and not to a measure which is itself legislative in form (as was the case with Amendment I). The Tribunal can see nothing in the text of Article 4 to support, let alone compel, such an interpretation. Nor does the Tribunal agree that considerations of logic compel it to read such a limitation into the provision. There is no reason in principle why States should not agree that the legality of any type of expropriation measure (including a legislative one) could be reviewed by the competent national authorities.\n\n371.\n\nLastly, the Claimant contends that Article 4(4) lacks the significance which the Respondent attributes to it, because it provides only for the right to have the legality of the expropriation reviewed and does not make any provision for the national authorities to review the question whether or not an expropriation has occurred. In the Claimant's view, the question whether there has been an expropriation or comparable measure has to be determined by an arbitral tribunal, even though the question whether or not that measure is lawful is reserved to the relevant national authorities. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this analysis is unrealistic and is unsupported by the text of Article 4(4) and 4(5). The power to determine whether an expropriation or comparable measure is lawful is a far more extensive power than is the power to determine the amount of compensation to be paid (or the arrangement for the payment of that compensation) in respect of such a measure. It is also one which, in any case in which legality is contested, must necessarily be exercised first. The idea that an investor might go to an Article 8 tribunal for the determination of whether there had been an expropriation, then to the national authorities for review of the legality of that expropriation and, finally, back to an Article 8 tribunal for the assessment of the amount of compensation is far too cumbersome to be plausible.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Article 4(4) and 4(5) provide for a division of responsibility. Article 4(4) reserves disputes about the principle of expropriation to the national authorities, while the amount of compensation and the arrangements for payment of compensation can be referred to the national authorities or to an arbitration tribunal under Article 8.\n\n373.\n\nBoth Parties referred to a number of arbitration awards which they invoked in support of their respective interpretations of Articles 4 and 8 of the BIT. The Tribunal has examined these awards with care. While it accepts that they offer some assistance, the Tribunal considers that a degree of caution is called for in relying upon them. It is not simply that there is no doctrine of binding precedent in international law; most of the awards invoked by the Parties concerned the jurisdictional provisions of other BITs which use different terms from those employed in the present BIT. As such, expressions of opinion about the meaning of those terms are only indirectly relevant to the interpretation of the present BIT.\n\n374.\n\nThe exception is the award of the tribunal in *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic*, which concerned the same BIT as that in the present case. The tribunal in that case unanimously407 concluded that the ordinary meaning of the words used in Article 8 of the BIT meant that jurisdiction was \"limited to disputes about the amount of the compensation and does not extend to review of the principles of expropriation.\"408 It found that such an interpretation was confirmed by the provisions of Article 4(4) and 4(5) which it considered provided that\n\nClaims about the principle of expropriation are for the local authorities under Article 4(4) and claims about the amount of compensation are for the local authorities or for an arbitral tribunal under Articles 4(5) and 8. In the second case, the investor has a choice of means. In the first one, he has no choice of means. His choice is limited to whether to challenge the principle of expropriation or not. If he decides to challenge it, he must do so before the local authorities. The ordinary meaning of Article 4(4) and 4(5) is plain.409\n\nThe tribunal rejected an argument that this conclusion was contrary to the object and purpose of the BIT:\n\nIn assessing the scope of Article 8 of the Treaty in the light of the Treaty's object and purpose, the Tribunal cannot ignore the investment protection regime set up by the Contracting States. Here they have in particular agreed that an investor may challenge the legality of an expropriation but only before the local authorities. The observation that they did not provide for arbitration on every aspect of all treaty breaches cannot be deemed to be contrary to the Treaty's object and purpose of protecting investment. It all depends on the protection contracted for. Otherwise the provisions of an investment protection treaty (without or) with limited access to arbitration would necessarily have to be viewed as contrary to the object and purpose of that treaty consisting *inter alia* in protecting investment.410\n\nThe tribunal in *Austrian Airlines* thus analysed the relevant provisions of the BIT in exactly the same way as the present Tribunal has done.\n\nProfessor Kaufmann-Kohler, Judge Brower and Dr Trapl constituted the tribunal. Judge Brower dissented, but not on this point.\n\n*Austrian Airlines*, *supra* note 327, \u00b696.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b698.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6103.\n\n375.\n\n*EMV v. Czech Republic* was relied upon by both Parties. That case concerned the 1989 BIT between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Article 8 of that BIT provided that an arbitration tribunal would have jurisdiction over \"disputes \u2026 concerning compensation due by virtue of Article 3 paragraphs (1) and (3).\" Article 3(1) provided that\n\nInvestments made by investors of one of the Contracting Parties in the territory of the other Contracting Party may not be expropriated or subjected to other measures of direct or indirect dispossession, total or partial, having a similar effect, unless such measures are\n\n(a) taken in accordance with a lawful procedure and are not discriminatory;\n\n(b) accompanied by provisions for the payment of compensation, which shall be paid to the investors in convertible currency and without delay. The amount shall correspond to the real value of the investments on the day before the measures were taken or made public.411\n\nThe *EMV* tribunal rejected an argument similar to that advanced by the Respondent in the present case and held that the jurisdiction conferred by Article 8 of the Belgium-Luxembourg-CSR BIT included jurisdiction to determine whether an expropriation or other measure within the meaning of Article 3(1) had taken place. It stated that\n\nIn the absence of a clear provision for these issues to be determined in some other forum these determinations must be made by the tribunal which is determining the amount of compensation payable or the system of investment protection created by the Treaty will be rendered wholly ineffective.412\n\nHowever, the tribunal expressly compared the provisions in the BIT which it had to apply with those of the BIT at issue in the present case:\n\nThe above conclusion is supported by the fact that the treaty is silent as to where and how the issues of expropriation and dispossession are to be determined. The Respondent has suggested that this could be in the local courts or under inter-State arbitration under Article 7 of the treaty. However, these solutions are neither practicable nor expressly intended by the Treaty.\n\nOne can presume that a foreign investor will not generally seek redress for the action of a government expropriating it or dispossessing it of its property in the local courts *unless that is expressly provided in the BIT (as is the case in the BIT between Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic)*.413\n\nThe tribunal went on to say that, if it had been the intention and policy of the Czechoslovak Government at the time of negotiating the BIT to exclude the question whether there had been an expropriation justifying compensation from an Article 8 tribunal, \"it could and should have expressly provided how all issues prior to the question of compensation were to be determined, *i.e.* local courts or international tribunal, and then to provide separately for how compensation was to be resolved if not agreed.\"414\n\nThe provisions of Article 3(3) are not material for present purposes. The treaty was authentic in Czech and French; the quotation is from a translation used by the tribunal which appears to have been agreed between the parties.\n\n*EMV*, *supra* note 391, \u00b658.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b660-61 (emphasis added).\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b663.\n\n376.\n\nTaken as a whole, therefore, the analysis of the *EMV* tribunal tends to support the arguments of the Respondent in the present arbitration. Article 4(4) of the present BIT contains precisely the express provision as to how all issues prior to the question of compensation were to be resolved. Moreover, the tribunal referred to the present BIT, by way of comparison with the treaty it had to construe, in such a way as to suggest that the answer would have been different under the present BIT.\n\n377.\n\nThat conclusion is reinforced by the analysis of the English High Court,415 before which the award was challenged under a provision in the United Kingdom's Arbitration Act which required the Court to rehear the question of jurisdiction.416 The High Court concluded that the tribunal had been right in finding that it had jurisdiction. In reaching that conclusion, however, the judge, Simon J, emphasised two features of the Belgium-Luxembourg BIT which are absent from the present BIT. First, he held that the phrase \"concerning compensation\" could not, as a matter of the ordinary meaning of the words used, be read to mean only \"relating to the amount of compensation\".417 In the present case, however, the phrase used in Article 8(1) is \"with regard to the *amount or the arrangements for payment of* compensation\". Secondly, Simon J emphasised that the phrase \"due by virtue of\" in Article 8 of the BIT at issue in the case before him \"connects entitlement to compensation to events specified in Articles 3(1) and (3).\"418 That phrase is noticeably absent from Article 8 of the present BIT.\n\n*Czech Republic v. EMV SA* [2007] EWCA 2851 (Comm), Simon J. (RL-141).\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b613.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b643.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b645.\n\n378.\n\nThe Respondent's case is also supported by *RosInvest v. Russian Federation*.419 That case arose under the 1989 UK-USSR BIT, the jurisdictional provision of which provided (in the English text) that\n\nThis Article shall apply to any legal disputes between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in relation to an investment of the former either concerning the amount or payment of compensation under Articles 4 or 5 of this Agreement, or concerning any other matter consequential upon an act of expropriation in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement, or concerning the consequences of the non-implementation, or of the incorrect implementation, of Article 6 of this Agreement *.*420\n\nThe text was thus similar to that in Article 8(1) of the present BIT in expressly referring to the \"amount\" of compensation and in not employing the phrase \"due by virtue of\". On the other hand, there was no equivalent of Article 4(4) and (5). The tribunal unanimously concluded421 that the clause quoted above did not confer jurisdiction to determine whether there had been an expropriation. It considered that a grant of jurisdiction to determine a dispute regarding the \"amount of compensation\" did not extend to determining whether there had been an act giving rise to an entitlement to compensation.422\n\n*RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. V079/2005 (Jurisdiction Award, 5 October 2007) (hereinafter \" *RosInvest* \") (CL-135).\n\nThe tribunal held that the differences between this text and the Russian text were not significant for the purposes of the question it had to decide.\n\nSir Franklin Berman added a note to \u00b6123 that the precedential effect of the award had to be treated with caution.\n\n*RosInvest*, *supra* note 419, \u00b6\u00b6110-114.\n\n379.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimant's case derives some support from the award in *Renta 4 v. Russian Federation*. The relevant BIT in that case was the 1991 BIT between Spain and the Russian Federation, Article 10 of which conferred jurisdiction with regard to \"any dispute \u2026 relating to the amount or method of payment of the compensation due under Article 6 of this Agreement.\" Article 6 provided that\n\nAny nationalization, expropriation or any other measure having similar consequences taken by the authorities of either Party against investments made within its territory by investors of the other Party, shall be taken only on the grounds of public use and in accordance with the legislation in force in the territory. Such measures should on no account be discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay the investor or his beneficiary adequate compensation, without undue delay and in freely convertible currency.\n\n380.\n\nThe tribunal unanimously concluded that it had jurisdiction over whether an expropriation or similar measure within the meaning of Article 6 had taken place. The award is closely reasoned and contains an important critique of the award in *RosInvest*. It also examines in greater detail than any of the other awards cited by the Parties the practical difficulties to which a jurisdiction limited to determining the amount or method of payment of compensation could give rise. For a number of reasons, however, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the award in *Renta 4* should lead it to accept the Claimant's arguments in the present case.\n\n381.\n\nFirst, the wording of Article 10 of the Spain-Russian Federation BIT differs in an important respect from that of Article 8 of the BIT in the present case. It is true that both provisions expressly refer to the \"amount\" and the \"method of payment\" (or in the present BIT, the \"arrangements for payment\"), unlike the BIT at issue in the *EMV* case. Nevertheless, the *Renta 4* tribunal was faced with a clause which conferred jurisdiction over disputes \"relating to the amount or method of payment of the compensation *due under Article 6* of this Agreement.\" Article 8 of the present BIT does not use the phrase \"due under\" or \"due by virtue of\" but rather uses the phrase \"in accordance with\". The Tribunal has already referred to the significance it attaches to that phrase (a significance also mentioned by the High Court in *EMV*). The *Renta 4* tribunal itself considered the phrase to be significant.423\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Renta 4*, *supra* note 391, \u00b6\u00b631, 35.\n\n382.\n\nSecondly, the BIT under consideration in *Renta 4* contained no equivalent of Article 4(4) and 4(5) of the present BIT. The significance of that point is thrown into sharp relief by paragraphs 58 and 59 of the *Renta 4* award. Having noted what it saw as the unsatisfactory consequences of a provision leaving the question whether there had been an expropriation to be determined by the national courts of the respondent State, the *Renta 4* tribunal went on to say\n\nThe present Tribunal does not deny that such a provision could be given effect if such was the clear import of the Treaty. Article 6 might have explained how entitlement is to be determined. Article 10 might have stipulated that the proposition that compensation is \"due\" may be established only by an authority identified in Article 6. But there is nothing of the kind.424\n\nIn the present BIT, however, there is \"something of the kind\", namely the provisions of Article 4(4) and Article 4(5).\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b658-59.\n\n383.\n\nLastly, it is noticeable that one of the *Renta 4* arbitrators, Judge Brower, was also a member of the tribunal in *Austrian Airlines* and concurred in the latter tribunal's decision that Article 8(1) of the present BIT does not confer jurisdiction over anything other than the amount and arrangements for payment of compensation. The award in *Austrian Airlines* was given some six months after that in *Renta 4* award and expressly distinguishes the BIT between Austria and the Slovak Republic from those at issue in *Renta 4*, commenting that what might have been \"a valid argument under the treaties applicable in *EMV v. Czech Republic* and *Renta 4 v. Russia* \u2026 cannot succeed here in the light of the unmistakable meaning of Articles 8 and 4.\"425 Judge Brower concurred both in this part of the *Austrian Airlines* award and in the corresponding part of *Renta 4*.\n\n*Austrian Airlines*, *supra* note 327, \u00b6101.\n\n384.\n\nThe reasoning in these four awards and in the judgment of the High Court in *EMV* thus reinforces the conclusion which the present Tribunal had provisionally reached in relation to the ordinary meaning of the words in Articles 4 and 8 of the present BIT. The Tribunal did not find the other awards cited by the Parties of much assistance. *Berschader v. Russian Federation*, on which the Respondent relied, comes to the same conclusion as *RosInvest*, but the relevant part of the award is *obiter* and contains no reasoning not set out in the other awards reviewed above. *Saipem v. Bangladesh*, *Telenor v. Hungary* and *Sedelmayer v. Russian Federation* are invoked by the Claimant, because they all take the view that the BIT in question conferred jurisdiction to determine whether there had been an expropriation but in none of the cases was the issue contested. In addition, the BIT in *Saipem* contained an arbitration clause in terms significantly broader than that in the present case. *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru* contains more of a discussion, but the relevant treaty provision was significantly different from that in the present case.\n\n385.\n\nTwo other matters need to be considered before the Tribunal can reach a final conclusion on this point. First, the Claimant argues that a broader construction is justified by the object and purpose of the BIT. It maintains that the purpose of the BIT is to ensure investor protection and that this goal justifies a more expansive construction of Article 8 so as to render the right of recourse to arbitration, which it sees as a key feature of that protection, more effective. In this argument, it derives considerable support from the reasoning in *Renta 4* and, to some extent, from that of the High Court in *EMV.* The Tribunal agrees that the protection of foreign investment is one (though not the only one) of the purposes of the BIT and is, therefore, an important factor in interpretation of the provisions of the BIT. That does not, however, entitle the Tribunal to disregard or ride roughshod over the provisions agreed between the States Parties to the BIT. Reference to the object and purpose of a treaty does not entitle a tribunal to rewrite the bargain between the parties to that treaty on the ground that they could have made a better bargain which would more effectively have secured the object and purpose of their treaty. In particular, the Tribunal cannot accept what appears to be the premise of the Claimant's argument, namely that treaty provisions laying down standards of substantive treatment for an investor must be deemed ineffective if they are not enforceable through arbitration. It may well be the case that such provisions are more effective if they are enforceable in that way, but the States Parties to the present BIT clearly decided that (subject to the later discussion of the MFN clause) they would adopt several substantive standards, such as the requirement of fair and equitable treatment in Article 2, which would not be enforceable through arbitration. There are numerous other BITs in which the same choice has been made and one State which is both a major recipient of foreign investment and the State of nationality of some important investors, namely Australia, has recently announced that its policy will be not to include any investor-State arbitration provisions in its future BITs. Like the tribunal in the *Austrian Airlines* case, the Tribunal considers, therefore, that considerations of the object and purpose of the BIT cannot prevail over the clear meaning of the words used in Articles 4 and 8 of the BIT.\n\n386.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant argued that there was in reality no possibility of it being able to contest the issue whether it had been the victim of an expropriation or equivalent measure in proceedings in the courts of the Slovak Republic, so that a broader interpretation of Article 8 was required. The Tribunal does not agree. It is unable to see how an argument about what remedies might be available in 2012 can be relevant to the interpretation of an agreement concluded twenty years earlier. Moreover, the Claimant's argument sits uneasily alongside the fact that it has commenced proceedings in the Slovak courts raising, *inter alia*, precisely this question.\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis of the text of Article 8 in its context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT having led to a clear conclusion, it is not necessary to examine the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the BIT. However, since these will have to be examined in connection with the MFN argument (considered below), the Tribunal observes that, although the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of Article 8 make clear that the provision was intentionally narrowed from the much wider clause originally proposed by Austria, they contain no clear indication of precisely how narrow the new clause was intended to be and thus do not add anything to the preceding analysis.\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, subject to what it will say in the following sections of the award regarding the 2011 judgment of the Constitutional Court and the Claimant's MFN argument, the Respondent's third jurisdictional objection is well-founded.\n\n**B. THE JUDGMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Positions of the Parties***\n-------------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal must next consider the Claimant's argument regarding the effect of the 2011 judgment of the Constitutional Court on the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction regarding the Article 4 claims. Each Party submitted expert evidence on the effects of the judgment: the Respondent annexed to its Reply a witness statement from Professor JUDr J\u00e1n Klu\u010dka, CSc, while the Claimant submitted with its Rejoinder a witness statement from Professor JUDr Alexander Br\u00f6stl, CSc. Both experts are former judges of the Constitutional Court. Although this issue arises in relation to the Respondent's third jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal begins with the arguments put forward by the Claimant, since it was the Claimant which advanced the argument that the judgment provides a response to that jurisdictional objection.\n\n***(1) The Claimant***\n----------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe judgment of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic, adopted on 26 January 2011 and delivered on 24 March 2011,426 concluded that Amendment I contravened the Constitution of the Slovak Republic in the following ways:\n\n(1) it amounted to a material restriction of property rights, contrary to Article 20 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR;\n\n(2) it entailed an unjustified interference with the right of the private health insurers to conduct their business, contrary to Article 35 of the Constitution;\n\n(3) it involved a Constitutionally unacceptable interference with the general principle of the rule of law.\n\nThe case had been brought before the Constitutional Court by a group of deputies of the National Assembly of the Slovak Republic.\n\nPL.\u00daS 3/09-378 (CL-105).\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the judgment amounts to a finding that its investment was the subject of an unlawful expropriation and that \"[t]he matter is now finally determined by the Slovak Republic's highest court on this issue and is *res judicata*.\"427 The Claimant acknowledges that it was not a party to the proceedings before the Constitutional Court but maintains that the judgment has effect *erga omnes*, so that \"it does not matter whether the Constitutional Court's decision specifically addresses an individual investor.\"428\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6297-298.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6206.\n\n392.\n\nWhile the judgment does not speak of \"expropriation\" but rather of \"substantial restriction of property rights,\"429 the Claimant argues that the \"facts subsumed by the Constitutional Court under the Slovak constitutional law category of \u2018substantial restriction of property rights' can be subsumed under the concept of \u2018measures having similar consequences' in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\"430 In any event, the Claimant submits that since the Tribunal has to decide the dispute under the Treaty, and thus under international law, the precise categorization of the act under Slovak constitutional law is irrelevant431 since what matters in international arbitration is the factual determination of the measure under international law, not under the national law of respondent State.432\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6184-192.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6184, citing Dr Br\u00f6stl's Legal Opinion (CEWS-3).\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6188.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6188-191, citing *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL (Partial Award, 13 September 2001) (hereinafter \" *CME* \") (RL-134), \u00b6467; *Siemens*, *supra* note 335, \u00b6267; and *Kardassopoulos*, *supra* note 336, \u00b6182.\n\n***(2) The Respondent***\n------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Respondent replied that the doctrine of *res judicata* could not be applicable as the Claimant had not been a party to the proceedings before the Constitutional Court. According to the Respondent, the doctrine of *res judicata* applies only in the event that the parties to the earlier proceedings are the same as those in the subsequent proceedings. In any event, the Respondent, referring to the language used by the Constitutional Court, maintained that the judgment did not amount to a finding of expropriation or other similar measures but was based upon different considerations.\n\n***2. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this is not a case of *res judicata*. As the British-United States Claims Tribunal explained:\n\nIt is a well established rule of law that the doctrine of *res judicata* applies only where there is identity of the parties and of the question at issue.433\n\nThese requirements were reiterated by the Permanent Court of International Justice in its Opinion on the *Polish Postal Service in Danzig*, and feature in the literature on *res judicata*.434 Neither the Claimant in the proceedings before this Tribunal, nor its subsidiary EIC, was party to the proceedings before the Constitutional Court, so the doctrine of *res judicata* has no application.\n\n*The Newchang*, (1921) Nielsen's Report 411, p. 415.\n\n*Polish Postal Service in Danzig*, PCIJ Reports, 1925, Series B No. 11, p. 30; *See*, *e.g.*, the chapter of *res judicata* in B. Cheng, *General Principles of Law* (1953) (RL-297), p. 339 *et seq.*\n\n395.\n\nNevertheless, that does not make the judgment of the Constitutional Court irrelevant. Article 4(4) of the BIT gives the Claimant the right to have the legitimacy of an act of expropriation or other similar measure determined by the competent authorities of the Respondent. If, as the Claimant suggests, one effect of the judgment of the Constitutional Court is that the legality of Amendment I cannot be raised in other proceedings before the Slovak courts, because the matter was treated as having been settled by that judgment, it would be unduly formalistic to hold that the judgment of the Constitutional Court could not qualify as the Article 4(4) ruling for the purpose of proceedings brought under Articles 8 and 4(5) of the BIT. The Tribunal considers, therefore, that it must inquire into what was decided by the judgment of the Constitutional Court.\n\n396.\n\nIn doing so, it is particularly important to be clear as to precisely what is the issue before this Tribunal. That issue is whether or not the Constitutional Court found that Amendment I amounted to an expropriation, or a measure of similar effect, within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT. The Court was not, of course, applying the BIT. It judged Amendment I against the yardstick of the Constitution and the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol I to the European Convention on Human Rights. Nevertheless, that does not render the judgment irrelevant for present purposes. If the Court considered Amendment I to be an expropriation, or characterised it in such a way as to make clear that the Court treated Amendment I as an act having effects similar to an expropriation, that judgment would be of considerable importance for the present proceedings.435\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Claimant argued that Slovakia could not rely upon Slovak law, as applied by the Court, to avoid its obligations under international law, *see* Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6188 et seq. The Tribunal does not see the relevance of this argument. There is a well established principle in international law that a State may not rely upon its own domestic law to justify non-compliance with a treaty obligation but that is not the issue here. There is no suggestion that the Respondent can rely upon the judgment of the Constitutional Court, or upon that Court's application of Slovak law, to avoid being found in breach of the BIT; the question is whether the judgment of the Constitutional Court amounts to a finding that there had been an expropriation or other similar act, thus enabling the Claimant to avoid the limits on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article 8 of the BIT which the Tribunal has identified in Chapter V(A) of the award.\n\n397.\n\nIt follows that the only part of the judgment of the Constitutional Court which is material is its finding that Amendment I constituted a \"forced restriction of ownership rights of health insurance agencies and their shareholders.\"436 The Court's other findings \u2013 that the Amendment was a violation of the Constitutional right to conduct a business and that it infringed the Constitutional protection of the rule of law \u2013 address different matters and have no direct bearing on whether the Amendment was considered to be an expropriation or similar measure.\n\nParagraph (a) of the Court's conclusions (Part VI, p. 63 of the English translation supplied by the Claimant; (CL-105)).\n\n398.\n\nIn concluding that the Amendment was a restriction of ownership rights, the Court applied Article 20 of the Constitution, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\n(1) Everyone shall have the right to own property. Property rights of all owners shall be uniformly construed and equally protected by law. The right of inheritance is guaranteed.\n\n\u2026\n\n(4) Expropriation or restrictions of right in property may be imposed only to the necessary extent and in public interest, based on the law and for a valuable consideration.\n\n399.\n\nThe Court also took account of Article 1 of Protocol I to the ECHR, which reads as follows:\n\n*Protection of Property*\n\nEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\n\n400.\n\nIt is apparent that both of these provisions, while they include the acts of expropriation, also embrace other measures concerning property which fall short of anything that could be regarded as expropriation. In the case of Article 20 of the Constitution, the Respondent's expert witness, Professor Klu\u010dka, testified that the concept of forced restriction of ownership rights included expropriation but also encompassed a range of lesser measures. Professor Br\u00f6stl, the Claimant's expert witness, considered that\n\nforced restriction of ownership rights in Article 20(4) of the Constitution is close to an equivalent to indirect expropriation (\"measures having similar consequences\" as expropriation and nationalization) in the sense of Article 4(1) of the Austria/Slovakia BIT.\n\nHe did not, however, consider the two concepts to be identical.437\n\nCEWS 3, \u00b613(a).\n\n401.\n\nIn the case of Article 1 of the Protocol, the ECtHR has held, in *Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden* that\n\nThat Article comprises three distinct rules. The first rule, which is of a general nature, enounces the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property; it is set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph. The second rule covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; it is set out in the second sentence of the same paragraph. The third rule recognizes that the States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose; it is contained in the second paragraph.438\n\nThe ECtHR, however, recognizes a close relationship between these three rules.\n\n(1982) 68 ILR 86, \u00b661.\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article 20 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Protocol are broader in scope than Article 4 of the BIT and were treated as such by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of March 24, 2011. That is scarcely surprising. Both Article 20 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Protocol contain a comprehensive protection of property rights. Article 4 of the BIT, on the other hand, is only one of a number of provisions protecting the property rights of an investor. In particular, Article 2(1) of the BIT requires that the investment be accorded fair and equitable treatment. Some aspects of the protection afforded by Article 1 of the Protocol and Article 20 of the Constitution, as discussed in the judgment of March 2011 (and the Strasbourg case-law cited therein), appear to correspond to the protection afforded by the right to fair and equitable treatment, rather than the protection from expropriation and similar measures.\n\n403.\n\nThe Constitutional Court did not find that Amendment I amounted to expropriation (and the plaintiffs in the proceedings before it seem not to have contended that it did). At page 49 of its judgment, the Court stated that\n\nWhen there is expropriation, there is transfer of ownership title to the property. When there is restriction of ownership, no transfer occurs, there is only interference with the scope of entitlements arising out of the ownership title warranted by the Constitution (II. US 8/97). Section 20 subsection 4 of the Constitution suggests that interference with ownership rights (either through expropriation or forced restriction thereof) may be acceptable from the point of view of the Constitution only if it is made in the public interest and to the extent, which is strictly necessary, by virtue of the law and against fair compensation.439\n\nHaving thus distinguished between expropriation and restriction of ownership rights, the Court then proceeded to a finding that Amendment I amounted to a restriction of ownership rights.\n\n*See* also pp. 46-47.\n\n404.\n\nNevertheless, as the Claimant points out in its Rejoinder, Article 4(1) deals not only with expropriation but also with measures having the same (or, in some translations, similar) consequences. The Tribunal has therefore considered whether the restriction of ownership rights which the Constitutional Court found had occurred amounted to a measure having the same, or similar, consequences as expropriation, a concept which can be described as \" *de facto* expropriation\". That is not an easy task since the Court, unsurprisingly given that it was not applying the BIT, did not express itself in the language of Article 4(1). Nevertheless, the Tribunal has concluded that the Court did not find that Amendment I amounted to a measure having the same (or similar) consequences as expropriation. As the Court said, the essence of expropriation is a taking of ownership rights. There is nothing in the Court's judgment to suggest that it considered that Amendment I produced consequences which were the same as, or similar to, such a taking.\n\n405.\n\nExamination of the Strasbourg judgments to which the Constitutional Court referred at pages 44-47 of its judgment, confirms the conclusion that it did not regard Amendment I as having attained that level. The Court noted that the ECtHR had interpreted the second rule in Article 1 of Protocol I as including not just formal expropriation but also *de facto* expropriation, which included deprivation of the right to dispose of property. It then cited the judgments of the ECtHR in *Mellacher v. Austria*440 and *Velosa Barreto v. Portugal*,441 both of which concerned the imposition of rent restrictions. In both cases, the ECtHR held that the acts in question did not amount to expropriation, either *de jure* or *de facto*, because the owner retained the right to dispose of the property but went on to consider whether the restriction on the use of the property by the owner amounted to a violation of the more general rule contained in Article 1. It seems to the Tribunal that the Constitutional Court was, therefore, clearly aware that there was a category of impermissible restrictions on the use of property by its owner which did not amount to *de facto* expropriation and that the dividing line between that category and *de facto* expropriation lay in whether or not the owner was deprived of the right to dispose of his property. The Court did not find that Amendment I went so far as to deprive the private health insurers and their shareholders of the right to dispose of their property (indeed, in the case of the Claimant, it was able to dispose of its shareholding \u2013 at a price substantially higher than it had paid for the shares \u2013 not long after the enactment of Amendment I). While the findings of the Constitutional Court, made as they were without reference to the provisions of the BIT and in general terms \u2013 none of the health insurers being party to the proceedings \u2013 are not easy to analyse in terms of Article 4(1) of the BIT, it is for the Claimant, as the party relying on the judgment on this point, to establish that the judgment of the Constitutional Court amounts to a finding that the Slovak Republic had adopted a measure of the kind covered by Article 4(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not succeeded in establishing that proposition.\n\n*Mellacher et al v. Austria, 12* E.H.R.R. 39 (Series A, No. 169) (1989).\n\n*Velosa Baretto v. Portugal*, 334 Eur. Ct. H.R. (Ser. A) (1995).\n\n406.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant's argument based upon the Constitutional Court's judgment of 24 March 2011, to the effect that it would amount to a finding that Amendment I was an expropriation, or a measure equivalent to an expropriation, of the Claimant's rights within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\n**C. THE EFFECT OF THE MFN CLAUSE**\n-----------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal thus turns to the argument advanced by the Claimant regarding the effect of the MFN clause in the BIT. That clause is contained in Article 3, which provides as follows:\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their investments treatment that is no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third States and their investments.\n\n(2) The provisions of para. 1, however, shall not apply to present or future privileges granted by one Contracting Party to investors of a third State or their investments in connection with\n\n(a) an economic union, customs union, a common market, free trade zone or economic community;\n\n(b) an international agreement or a bilateral agreement or national laws and regulations concerning matters of taxation;\n\n(c) a regulation to facilitate border traffic.\n\nThe translation is that supplied by the Claimant after the close of the hearings but, in contrast to the position regarding certain other provisions, it is not contested by the Respondent.442 Again, it is appropriate to begin with the Claimant's arguments.\n\nRespondent's letter to the Tribunal of 27 January 2012, p. 4 contains the statement that \"to assist the Tribunal in narrowing the areas of disagreement between the Parties, Respondent notes that, in the case of the Preamble and Articles 3, 6, 7 and 9, there are no material differences between Respondent's Exhibit RL-40B and Claimant's newly proposed translation.\"\n\n***1. The Positions of the Parties***\n-------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Claimant***\n----------------------\n\n408.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the effect of Article 3 is that, notwithstanding the limitations in the text of Article 8, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its expropriation and Article 2 claims.443 The Claimant submits that MFN clauses are \"a source of international obligations other than those explicitly included in the basic treaty\" that allows for \"borrowing treaty provisions from other treaties or possibly state practice regarding third states.\"444 The Claimant argues that the Treaty's MFN clause in Article 3(1) is a \"neutral clause which is worded openly, without explicitly excluding or including matters of dispute resolution or the host state's consent to arbitration.\"445\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6299-334.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6301\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6302-303.\n\n409.\n\nThe Claimant challenges the *Austrian Airlines* majority's conclusion that the Treaty's MFN clause had to be read in the context of Article 8. Rather, the Claimant cites the dissenting opinion of Judge Brower who held that \"if every time an MFN clause were invoked it were read together with the provision which the MFN clause is alleged to circumvent, such a clause might never be given any effect; it would be vitiated by that which it seeks to avoid, modify or expand.\"446 The Claimant also argues that the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal erred in considering the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty to limit the scope of the MFN clause, pursuant to Article 32 VCLT, because the MFN clause is not ambiguous.447\n\n*Ibid.*,\u00b6305, citing *Austrian Airlines*, *supra* note 327, \u00b67. *See* also Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6216.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6304-307.\n\n410.\n\nThe Claimant traces the changes in the MFN clause during the negotiating history of the Treaty, and argues that the \" *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* show no intention of the parties to limit the scope and operation of the MFN clause by the working of the arbitration clause.\" The Claimant concludes that \"[i]f Article 8 was specifically negotiated (and narrowed down), Article 3 was equally specifically negotiated (and not narrowed down)\", noting in particular the fact that the exclusions listed in Article 3(2) do not include dispute resolution.448\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6234-235.\n\n411.\n\nThe Claimant discusses two cases, *RosInvest* and *Renta 4*, where \"the availability of broader dispute settlement clauses in other BITs of a host state via MFN clauses were confirmed.\"449 The Claimant relies on the *Renta 4* case for arguing that the MFN clause should apply to dispute resolution clauses, regardless of whether the right to bring arbitration is characterised as a procedural or substantive right. Indeed, in *Renta 4*, the tribunal rejected formal distinctions between procedural and substantive matters. The Claimant further refers to a number of commentators who agree that a broadly worded MFN clause that refers to \"treatment\" without qualification should be interpreted as applying to dispute settlement as well as substantive matters.450 The Claimant also argues, based on the finding of the *RosInvest* tribunal, that \"had the States Parties intended that the MFN clause should not apply to arbitration, it would have been easy to add corresponding language\" noting that this was done in other CSFR BITs.451\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6312-318, citing *RosInvest*, *supra* note 419; *Renta 4*, *supra* note 391.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6319-323..\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6317, citing *RosInvest*, *supra* note 419, \u00b6135.\n\n412.\n\nFurthermore, if an investor is unable to enforce its substantive rights under a BIT by means of arbitration, while other investors are able to enforce their treaty rights in such a fashion, the Claimant argues that the investor is clearly discriminated against with regard to the substantive rights themselves, in violation of the object and purpose of the treaty in general and the MFN clause in particular.\n\n413.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the term \"treatment\" in Article 3 is broad enough to apply to dispute resolution. In this regard, the Claimant first refers to a number of cases, including *Gas Natural v. Argentina* and *Maffezini,* where tribunals interpreted MFN clauses referring to \"all matters\", and concluded that \"unless it appears clearly that the States Parties to a BIT \u2026 settled on a different method for resolution of disputes that may arise, most-favoured-nation provisions in BITs should be understood to be applicable to dispute settlement.\"452 The Claimant asserts that there is no reason to interpret the term \"treatment\" narrowly and that it is only a small step to interpret a broad term like \"treatment\" to cover dispute settlement as well, even where the MFN clause lacks the language of \"all matters\".453 Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the term \"treatment\" in Article 3 is only limited by the three circumstances enumerated in Article 3(2).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6225, citing *Gas Natural SDG v. Argentina*, ICSID No. ARB/03/10, (Decision of the Tribunal on Preliminary Questions on Jurisdiction, June 17, 2005) (CL-117) (hereinafter \" *Gas Natural* \").\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6227-228, citing *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID No. ARB/07/17 (Award, 21 June 2011) (CL-187) (hereinafter \" *Impregilo* \").\n\n414.\n\nThe Claimant takes issue with the Respondent's characterisation of the Claimant's argument as using the MFN clause as a tool of incorporation. Rather, the Claimant argues that the MFN clause can be used to \"borrow more favourable clauses in other treaties.\"454\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6222.\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant distinguishes the cases cited by the Respondent which rejected using the MFN clause to broaden the dispute resolution clause available, submitting several differences in those cases from the Treaty in the case at hand. First, the Claimant argues that the *RosInvest* tribunal rejected expanding the dispute resolution clause via Article 3(1) of the UK-Soviet BIT because it afforded protection to \"investment\" and not \"investors\". The Claimant submits that the *Renta 4* tribunal denied the use of the MFN clause because of the wording of another article in the Spain-Russia BIT which limited the MFN clause to the realm of the fair and equitable treatment, which the Claimant contrasts with the language of the MFN in the Treaty.455 The Claimant disputes the relevance of the *Plama* decision for the case at hand, arguing that the relevant BIT in that case did not provide for investor-state arbitration and the investor was therefore trying to replace a jurisdictional provision which did not allow investor-state arbitration.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6252, citing *Renta 4*, *supra* note 391.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that, in application of the MFN clause, it may avail itself of treaties adopted before the present BIT.456 Furthermore, the Claimant argues, based on an ordinary meaning interpretation, that Article 3 of the Treaty contains no temporal limitations, since the treatment is \"accorded\", which includes both past and future tenses.457 In the alternative, the Claimant also relies on the Croatia-Slovakia BIT and the Hungary-Slovakia BIT which came into force in 1997 and 1996, respectively, and which make broad provision for the arbitration of disputes.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6261-270.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6263.\n\n417.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that \"[t]he comparator for the purpose of the MFN clause is not a \u2018particular investor' that has in fact been accorded more favourable treatment in the form of access to dispute resolution regarding \u2018the measures challenged here'\" as alleged by the Respondent.458 In any event, the Claimant asserts that there are other investors who have challenged the Amendment and who have benefited from wider dispute resolution clauses, pointing to *Eureko* and *HICEE* who commenced arbitration under the Netherlands-CSFR BIT.459\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6271.\n\n*Ibid*., citing *Eureko*, *supra* note 21, and *HICEE*, *supra* note 308.\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant contends that neither the ability to bring claims before the Slovak courts, nor the fact that it has done so in this case, proves in any way that this is an \"effective recourse.\" The Claimant stresses that it does not argue that national courts are \"inferior\" to international arbitration.460 Even if the courts did have jurisdiction however, the Claimant argues that Austrian investors would face \"an extremely uncertain legal environment.\" In the Claimant's view, this would come at a high cost which investors under more favourable BITs do not have to bear and thus forms an instance of \"concrete discrimination\" covered by the MFN provision.461\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6278.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6279-280.\n\n***(2) The Respondent***\n------------------------\n\n419.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant's invocation of the Article 3 MFN clause as a basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Respondent maintains that such an argument has already been conclusively rejected under the present Treaty in *Austrian Airlines*.\n\n420.\n\nThe Respondent argues that a \"clean reading of the investor-State jurisdictional clause of Article 8\", namely its circumscribed jurisdictional mandate, shows that the Tribunal \"has no power to exercise any authority with respect to Article 3.\"462 The Respondent also submits that, applying basic principles of Treaty interpretation, the Treaty's MFN clause provides no basis for incorporation of provisions from another Treaty to ground jurisdiction.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6401.\n\n421.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the MFN clause of Article 3 must be read in the context of the other provisions of the Treaty, including Article 8. The Respondent submits that Article 8 of the Treaty provides a narrow basis of jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes. According to the Respondent, the question is not whether the \"MFN clause applies to the Treaty's Article 8 dispute resolution provision, but whether in view of the narrowly-construed dispute resolution mechanism, the Tribunal may exercise any authority with respect to the MFN provision of Article 3\". The Respondent then answers in the negative, citing the cases of *Nagel v. Czech Republic*, *EMV*, and *Telenor*.463\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6409-412, 481-490, citing *Nagel v. Czech Republic*, SCC Case 49/2002 (Award, Sept. 9, 2003) (RL-379), *EMV*, *supra* note 391, and *Telenor*, *supra* note 391.\n\n422.\n\nThe Respondent counters the Claimant's reliance on *RosInvest*, submitting that the tribunal in that case \"did not enter into the much more general question [of] whether MFN-clauses can be used to transfer arbitration clauses from one treaty to another\" and that the MFN clause at issue had different wording (specifically the terms \"use\" and \"enjoyment\"), and broader scope.464 The Respondent equally objects to the Claimant's reliance on the *Renta 4* decision, alleging that the award did not extend the MFN clause to \"enlarge the competence of the tribunal\" and that its \"BIT by BIT analysis\" applied to this case demonstrates that \"treatment\" does not extend to dispute settlement.465\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6416, 468-470, citing *RosInvest*, *supra* note 419.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6471-475, citing *Renta 4*, *supra* note 391.\n\n423.\n\nThe Respondent also distinguishes the *Maffezini* decision, submitting that it was based on a broad jurisdictional clause.466 The Respondent further cites the *Plama* award for the proposition that \"an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them\" which it contends is not the case at hand.467 Lastly, the Respondent submits that, where tribunals have applied MFN clauses to dispute settlement matters, they have done so only in respect of waiting periods and other procedural hurdles and not in order to broaden the scope of jurisdiction under the relevant treaty.468\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6476-480, citing *Emilio Augstin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 (Decision of the Tribunal on Objection to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000) (RL-151) (hereinafter \" *Maffezini* \").\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6487, citing *Plama*, *supra* note 377.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6489.\n\n424.\n\nThe Respondent counters the Claimant's argument that Article 3 is a tool of incorporation, which it argues is \"unsupported by the text of the Treaty, as well as fundamental logic and rules of international law.\"469 The Respondent submits that Article 3 sets out a treatment obligation, and does not allow for \"borrowing\" treaty provisions from other treaties.470 In addition, the Respondent argues that customary international law requires that consent to jurisdiction be established by a preponderance of evidence, which standard cannot be met here given the clear intention to limit jurisdiction in Article 8.471\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6420-431.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6421-422.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6427-430.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the \"treatment\" referred to in Article 3 does not include dispute resolution and contests the Claimant's characterisation of Article 3 as a broad MFN clause.472 Rather, the Respondent submits that Article 3 is narrowly phrased in contrast to broad MFN clauses that read \"[i]n all matters subject to this Agreement\", the latter drafting being the basis underlying the decisions that have extended MFN treatment to dispute settlement matters under other treaties.473\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6432-453.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6434, distinguishing, *e.g.*, *Maffezini*, *supra* note 466.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Treaty text itself confirms that \"treatment\" in Article 3(1) pertains only to substantive matters, since where reference is made to the adjudicatory process the Treaty employs the term \"right\", while the term \"privileges\" and \"treatment\" are used in Article 3.474\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6437-440.\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the commentary to the ILC Report on MFN provisions and the *ejusdem generis* rule of interpretation, arguing that unless there is substantial identity between the subject-matter of the MFN clause and dispute resolution clause, an MFN provision may result in imposing obligations on the State which were never contemplated and this violates general principles of treaty interpretation.475\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6441-442, citing Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Thirtieth Session [1978] Y.B.I.C.L. A/CN.4/SER.A/1978/Add.1.\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent also takes issue with the Claimant's argument that the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal did not properly consider the interpretive principle of *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*. The tribunal gave ample consideration to the principle and, in any event, the rule when applied to Article 8, clearly contradicts the Claimant's MFN-based claim to jurisdiction.476\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6448-452, citing *Austrian Airlines*, *supra* note 327, \u00b6\u00b6131, 135.\n\n429.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that, even if the MFN clause is used to incorporate provisions from other treaties, it would not eliminate Article 4(4) and (5), resulting in a pathological arbitration clause.477\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6453.\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's assertion that the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal improperly considered the Treaty's negotiating history. The Respondent argues that Article 32 of the VCLT provides for recourse to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* for treaty interpretation without any need for a formal finding that the treaty terms at issue are ambiguous, and in particular the *travaux* can be referred to in order to confirm an interpretation of the treaty. The Respondent submits that the negotiating history of Article 8 of the Treaty is dynamic and indicates a \"deliberate choice to limit the jurisdiction\". By contrast, the Respondent alleges that the history of the MFN clause is \"static\", which is why it was not considered by the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal.478\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6456-460.\n\n431.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the \"treaty practices of both Slovakia and Austria also confirm the conclusions that the State-Parties did not have dispute resolution in mind when they agreed upon the Article 3(1) MFN obligation\", a conclusion it alleges is supported by the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal.479\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6461-464, citing *Austrian Airlines*, *supra* note 327, \u00b6134.\n\n432.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the MFN clause only operates with regard to later treaties, and it contends that all four specific treaties invoked by the Claimant to supplant the instant Treaty's Article 8 entered into force before the BIT, such that they cannot be relied upon to expand the Tribunal's jurisdictional mandate.480\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6499-503.\n\n433.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that, even accepting *arguendo* that the different dispute resolution mechanisms constitute \"treatment\" under Article 3 of the Treaty, the Claimant has still failed to prove such treatment, as it has not shown that other investors have been accorded more favourable treatment.481 In addition, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant still has an effective recourse available before the Slovak courts and that the Claimant has offered \"no basis to judge the insufficiency of the Slovak courts.\"482\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6504-510.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6506-508.\n\n***2. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin its analysis by disposing of certain arguments which it does not consider to be well-founded.\n\n435.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule upon the Claimant's Article 3 argument, because Article 3 is not one of the provisions specified in Article 8 of the BIT. That argument confuses, or conflates, two entirely different issues. If the Claimant were seeking to advance before the Tribunal a claim that the Respondent had committed a violation of Article 3 of the BIT, as part of the substantive standards of protection prescribed by the BIT, by denying the Claimant recourse to arbitration, then the objection that such a claim is not within the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by Article 8 would be a potent one. However, that is not what the Claimant is seeking to do. The Claimant relies on Article 3 of the BIT, not as the substantive basis for a claim, but rather as indicating that each State Party to the BIT intended to make an offer to arbitrate that was wider than the terms of Article 8483 to the extent that such State Party concluded a treaty with a third State containing an arbitration clause which was wider and more favourable to an investor. The Tribunal agrees with the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal that it has jurisdiction to rule on this argument in the exercise of its *comp\u00e9tence de la comp\u00e9tence*.484 The Tribunal considers that the same confusion is evident in the Respondent's argument that the Claimant must adduce evidence of a specific investor of a third State who has received treatment more favourable than that accorded to the Claimant. The award in the NAFTA case of *Loewen v*. *United States*,485 on which the Respondent bases this argument, is not about the application of an MFN clause but concerns a claim for alleged discrimination. In order to recover damages for discriminatory treatment, a claimant must normally establish the existence of a comparator and then demonstrate that such comparator has received better treatment than that which the claimant has received. But, as explained in the previous paragraph, the Claimant in the present case is not making a claim for relief for an alleged breach of the MFN clause but is arguing that the effect of that clause is that it is entitled to the benefit of higher standards of protection provided for in other treaties. Accordingly, it is not a matter of comparison with the actual treatment accorded to a specific third State investor, but of comparison between the standard of treatment guaranteed to a group of investors by one treaty and the standard of treatment guaranteed to another group of investors by another treaty.\n\n*See Renta 4*, *supra* note 391, \u00b683.\n\n*Austrian Airlines*, *supra* note 327, \u00b6\u00b6117-118.\n\n*Loewen*, *supra* note 340.\n\n436.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal considers that it can derive only limited assistance from the numerous awards of other tribunals to which the Parties referred. While the Tribunal has paid careful attention to the awards in other cases, it is plain that they reveal no clear arbitral consensus on this issue. Indeed, so far from constituting a *jurisprudence constante*, they manifest a complete lack of consistency, which is the product of a fundamental difference of views between various arbitrators.486 Thus, arguments to the effect that an arbitration clause may be affected by the MFN provision have been accepted in *Maffezini v. Spain*, *Camuzzi v. Argentina*, *Gas Natural v. Argentina*, *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas and Interaguas v. Argentina*, *National Grid v. Argentina*, *Siemens v. Argentina*, *RosInvest v. Russian Federation*, *AWG Group v. Argentina*, *Impregilo v. Argentina* (with a dissenting opinion by Professor Stern) and *Hochtief v. Argentina* (with a dissenting opinion by Mr Thomas).487 Such arguments have, however, been rejected by the tribunals in *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales v. Mexico*, *Salini v. Jordan*, *Plama v. Bulgaria*, *Berschader v. Russian Federation* (with a dissenting opinion by Mr Weiler), *Telenor v. Hungary*, *Wintershall v. Argentina*, *Renta 4 v. Russian Federation* (with a separate opinion by Judge Brower), *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru*, *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic* (with a dissenting opinion by Judge Brower), *ICS v. Argentina*, and, most recently, *Daimler v. Argentina* (with a dissenting opinion by Judge Brower).488\n\nFor reviews of the extent of that difference, as manifested in the jurisprudence, see Julie Maupin, \"MFN-based Jurisdiction in Investor-State Arbitration: Is there any Hope for a Consistent Approach?\", 14 Journal of International Economic Law (2011) 157 and the exchange of views between Zachary Douglas, \"The MFN Clause in Investment Treaty Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation off the Rails\", 2 Journal of International Dispute Settlement (2011) 97 and Stephen Schill, \"Allocating Adjudicatory Authority: Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses as a Basis of Jurisdiction\", 2 Journal of International Dispute Settlement (2011) 353.\n\n*Maffezini*, *supra* note 466; *Camuzzi International S.A..v.

Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31 (Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 October 2011) (hereinafter \" *Hochtief* \").\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2 (Award, 29 May 2003) (RL-414); *Salini v. Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13 (Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 November 2004) (RL-403); *Plama*, *supra* note 377; *Berschader*, *supra* note 309; *Telenor*, *supra* note 391; *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v.

Argentina*, PCA Case No. 2010-9 (Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February 2012); *Daimler Financial Services v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/01 (Award, 22 August 2010).\n\n437.\n\nThis lack of a *jurisprudence constante* cannot be explained only by reference to differences between the terms of the BITs involved (although such differences can be significant). Of the four tribunals to have ruled on the effect of the MFN clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT on the requirement in the arbitration clause of that BIT that disputes could be submitted to arbitration only after a period of eighteen months had elapsed from their submission to the local courts, those in *Wintershall* and *Daimler* rejected the MFN argument, while those in *Siemens* and *Hochtief* accepted it. Moreover, even where tribunals have come to the same conclusion, they have often done so for radically different reasons, as a comparison between the awards in *Plama* and *Renta 4* demonstrates. Accordingly, while the Tribunal has drawn on the reasoning in the various awards where appropriate, it has not felt compelled to follow any particular line of awards.\n\n438.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes the Respondent's contention that there is no basis for the Tribunal to \"depart from\" the award of the majority in *Austrian Airlines*. In the view of the Tribunal, that way of putting the point goes too far. There is no doctrine of binding precedent in international law and the present Tribunal is not bound by the award in *Austrian Airlines* (or any other case). Nor is there a presumption in favour of following the award in *Austrian Airlines* in the sense that, unless the Claimant can offer a compelling reason to do so, the Tribunal is in some way obliged to decide the MFN point in the present case in the same way in which the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal decided that point in the case before it. Of course, the Tribunal has paid close attention to the award in *Austrian Airlines*, as will be apparent from the following paragraphs; it is a well reasoned award addressing precisely the point in issue here under the same BIT. It was, however, subject to a dissenting opinion on this point and the Tribunal does not consider that it can simply adopt the reasoning of the majority in *Austrian Airlines* without discussion.\n\n439.\n\nFinally, both Parties suggested that the Tribunal should approach the MFN issue from the standpoint of what they identified as a \"principle\" or \"presumption\" regarding a State's submission to arbitration. The Claimant urged that a broad, \"liberal\" approach was warranted by what it identified as the object and purpose of the BIT. By contrast, the Respondent argued that treaty provisions by which a State agrees to the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal should be restrictively construed. The Tribunal does not agree with either of these submissions. The Tribunal has already stated (in paragraph 326, above) that it does not consider that the object and purpose of the BIT require either a broad or a restrictive approach to the interpretation of its provision for arbitration. Nor does the Tribunal accept that there is any general principle of international law that the acceptance by a State of the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal must be restrictively construed.\n\n440.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considers that its approach to the question before it is not determined by the awards of tribunals in earlier cases or by any general principle or presumption regarding jurisdiction.\n\n441.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether or not the claims for alleged violations of Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT fall within the scope of the agreement to arbitrate. Where an investor initiates arbitration proceedings in reliance on the terms of a BIT, the agreement to arbitrate takes a peculiar form, arising from the fact that the claimant in the arbitration proceedings is relying on the provision for arbitration contained in an instrument \u2013 the BIT \u2013 to which it is not a party.489 The provision for arbitration in the BIT thus operates at two levels: as between the States Parties to the BIT, it is one of several reciprocal undertakings which take effect on the level of treaty commitments between two States, but it also operates as an offer extended by each State Party to investors of the other State Party to submit to arbitration the disputes specified in that provision. By initiating arbitration proceedings, an investor accepts that offer and thus brings into being the agreement to arbitrate from which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is derived. Since it is the terms of the offer which determine the content of the agreement to arbitrate, the limits of that agreement and, therefore, of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, are dictated by the intentions of the States Parties to the BIT as expressed in the provisions of the BIT, provisions which have to be interpreted in accordance with the international law rules on treaty interpretation set out in paragraphs 315-316, above.\n\nJan Paulsson, \"Arbitration without Privity\" 10(2) ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal (1995), p. 232.\n\n442.\n\nIn concluding that BIT, those two States were free to frame their offer of arbitration in whatever way they saw fit. It might be broad (*e.g.* applying to any dispute regarding a qualifying investment) or narrow (*e.g.* confining arbitration to disputes relating only to certain aspects of the treatment of investments required by the other provisions of the BIT). The more than 2000 BITs currently in force include a wide range of arbitration clauses of both kinds, as well as examples which fall between the two extremes and cases in which the BIT contains no provision for arbitration at all.\n\n443.\n\nThe States Parties to a BIT are also free to choose the manner in which they express their consent to arbitration. They may do so in one clause or in more than one. There is no inherent reason why the limits of the consent to arbitrate cannot be ascertained by examination of more than one clause. Nor is there any general principle which precludes an MFN clause from being one of those provisions which determine the extent of the consent to arbitration; if a BIT contained an MFN clause which expressly stated that it was applicable to the disputes settlement provision of that BIT (as is the case with some recent United Kingdom BITs),490 then a tribunal seeking to determine the extent of the consent to arbitrate under such a BIT would have to apply that MFN clause, as well as the arbitration clause in the treaty, in order to determine the scope of the State's consent to arbitration.\n\n*See* United Kingdom Model BIT 2005 (with 2006 amendments), Article 3(3).\n\n444.\n\nThe text of Article 3(1) is neutral in its wording. There is no express provision that the guarantee of most favoured nation treatment is intended to apply to investor-State arbitration but nor is there an express provision excluding that possibility. What the Tribunal is therefore called upon to decide is whether the States Parties to the present BIT intended that Article 3 should widen the offer of arbitration set out in Article 8 so as to include (a) issues regarding expropriation which Articles 4 and 8 taken together assign to the national courts and (b) issues regarding alleged violations of Article 2 of the BIT which are wholly outside the terms of Article 8.\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there is a fundamental difference between Article 8 of the BIT and the other provisions, including Article 3. The difference lies in the fact that the investor-State arbitration clause in a BIT is the only one which creates \u2013 or rather makes possible the creation of \u2013 a direct relationship between one of the States Parties to the BIT and an investor. The inter-State arbitration provision in a BIT operates at the \"normal\" level of relations between the two States Parties to the treaty. The provisions on substantive standards of treatment (such as a provision requiring fair and equitable treatment) confer rights upon investors, but do so entirely through the medium of agreement between the States Parties. By contrast, a clause which provides for the investor of one State Party to arbitrate with the other States Party, although it derives its legal force from the agreement between the two States Parties, operates (as explained in paragraph 441, above) not only as an undertaking between the States Parties but also as an offer by each State Party to qualifying investors of the other State Party. If such an investor opts to accept that offer by commencing arbitration proceedings, the result is the creation of an entirely new, direct, relationship between that investor and the State Party concerned. The resulting dual character of the investor-State arbitration provision was the (very substantial) innovation introduced into international law by the network of BITs and similar treaties and one which many States had difficulty accepting (as the records of negotiations concerning the present BIT and numerous other BITs demonstrate).\n\n446.\n\nThe provision for arbitration in a BIT is thus the gateway through which the investor must pass in order to create an arbitration agreement and confer jurisdiction upon a tribunal to hear its claims regarding breach of the standards of treatment to which it is entitled under the BIT. Applying an MFN clause so as to alter the scope of that arbitration provision is therefore a very different matter from applying an MFN clause to the other provisions of the BIT's legal r\u00e9gime which do not have the same dual character.\n\n447.\n\nThe full extent of that difference may be demonstrated by one example. If a BIT has no provision for investor-State arbitration, there is no offer of arbitration and thus no scope for the creation of an arbitration agreement. Even if that BIT contains a broadly worded MFN clause, that clause cannot substitute for the arbitration provision and make it possible for an investor successfully to bring arbitration proceedings against a State Party to the BIT, no matter what provisions for arbitration that State Party might have agreed to include in its other BITs. By contrast, if a BIT contains no provision on fair and equitable treatment, an investor may nonetheless be able to derive from the MFN clause contained in that BIT a right to be accorded such treatment by one of the States Parties, provided that there is at least one other BIT concluded by that State which contains a provision for fair and equitable treatment.\n\n448.\n\nWhile the present BIT does, of course, contain a provision for investor-State arbitration, the substantive scope of that provision is strictly limited. It encompasses disputes regarding Article 5 of the BIT and certain aspects of Article 4 but, as the Tribunal has found in Chapter V(A) of the Award, it excludes disputes regarding other aspects of Article 4 and alleged violations of the other provisions of the BIT. As regards those categories of disputes, there is no offer of arbitration at all. Acceptance of the Claimant's argument would therefore mean that the MFN clause completely transformed the scope of the arbitration provision.\n\n449.\n\nThat would be to accord the MFN clause a far more dramatic result than that achieved in all but one of the awards (listed in paragraph 436, above) in which a tribunal has upheld an argument that the MFN clause in a BIT affected that treaty's arbitration provision.491 With that one exception, all of those cases concerned, not limits on the substantive scope of the provision for arbitration, but requirements to submit a dispute to national courts for a period of time before that dispute could be brought to an investor-State arbitration tribunal. In those cases, the dispute was one which fell within the substantive scope of the offer to arbitrate. Even so, the issue was a highly controversial one, as demonstrated by the fact that the MFN argument was accepted by some arbitration tribunals and rejected by others. The Tribunal in the present case does not need to enter into that controversy and has no intention of doing so. It expresses no opinion on whether those tribunals which accepted the MFN argument in the time-limit cases were right to do so. For present purposes, the point is not whether those awards are correct but simply that, even if they are so regarded, they were not concerned with the kind of transformation in the scope of the offer to arbitrate which is at issue in the present proceedings.492\n\nThe exception is the *RosInvest* award, *supra* note 419.\n\nThe distinction is the subject of comment by the tribunal in *Hochtief*, *supra* note 487, \u00b6\u00b6 77-99.\n\n450.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that the special character of the provision for investor-State arbitration and the radical nature of the transformation in that provision which acceptance of the Claimant's argument would entail, both militate against attributing to Article 3 of the BIT the effect suggested by the Claimant unless there are clear indications that such was the intention of the States Parties.\n\n451.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find such clear indications in either the language of Article 3 or its place in the context of the BIT, taken as a whole, to warrant the conclusion that the States Parties intended that it should have the potential to transform the scope of the offer to arbitrate in the way suggested by the Claimant. Article 3(1) requires the Respondent to accord to Austrian investors and their investments \"treatment\" no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or investors of third States. The Tribunal is well aware that different tribunals have reached different conclusions regarding the meaning of the term \"treatment\" and, in particular, whether that term should be read as confined to \"substantive\" standards of treatment (such as those addressed in Articles 2 and 4 of the present BIT) or as including also access to investor-State arbitration. While the Tribunal agrees that either interpretation is plausible, it considers that the term \"treatment\" is more apposite to cover substantive standards of treatment than to apply to the provision for investor-State arbitration, given what has already been said above regarding the special character of that provision.\n\n452.\n\nThat conclusion is reinforced by consideration of the place which Article 3 occupies in the context of the BIT. Article 3(1) appears as part of a group of provisions which prescribe the substantive standards to be accorded by one State Party to investments and investors of the other State Party. Thus Article 2(1) requires that such investments shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment; Article 4 accords certain rights in respect of expropriation and similar measures; Article 5 guarantees rights of transfer. Article 3(1), as has been seen, requires that each State Party accord the other's investors \"treatment\" no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or investors of third States. Failure to comply with Article 3(1) would constitute a substantive breach of the BIT in just the same way as would failure to comply with Article 2(1), Article 4 or Article 5. Bearing in mind what has been said above about the differences between the substantive provisions of a BIT and the provision for investor-State arbitration, the fact that Article 3(1) is located in the group of substantive provisions and worded in the same way as the other substantive provisions suggests that it was not intended to be capable of transforming the scope and extent of the investor-State arbitration provision.\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article 3(2) is of no assistance in this matter. That provision excludes from the scope of Article 3(1) privileges granted to investors of a third State in connection with an economic union or similar agreement, taxation instruments and regulations on border traffic. The Claimant argues that, on the principle of *expressio unius exclusio alterius*, this list must be treated as an exhaustive list of the matters excluded from the scope of Article 3(1). Article 3(2) is not, however, dealing with the matters covered by Article 3(1) but rather with the sources to which Article 3(1) refers. Article 3(2) makes clear that, *e.g.*, an investor cannot use Article 3(1) to gain the benefit of a right to better treatment which has its source in an economic union or double taxation agreement. It says nothing about what type of right Article 3(1) was intended to apply to in the first place.\n\n454.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of Articles 3(1) and 8 confirm that the States Parties did not intend the former provision to have the potential for transforming the scope of the latter. The *travaux* of Article 8 show that there was a deliberate decision to narrow the scope of investor-State arbitration. The initial proposal from Austria was a clause which would have given jurisdiction in respect of any dispute regarding investments covered by the BIT. That was replaced, at the insistence of the CSFR, with a text substantially identical to the one finally agreed. By contrast, the *travaux* give no indication that Article 3 was intended to have an effect upon the carefully negotiated scope of Article 8. The Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the majority in the *Austrian Airlines* case that the *travaux* tend to confirm the interpretation of Article 3(1) advanced by the Respondent. What is even more important \u2013 given that the Claimant has to establish that the Parties intended to adopt a MFN provision capable of expanding the scope of their agreement on investor-State arbitration \u2013 is that the *travaux* lend no support to the interpretation advanced by the Claimant.\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, concludes that the MFN provision in Article 3(1) of the BIT does not affect the scope of its jurisdiction under Article 8 and rejects the Claimant's argument to the contrary.\n\n456.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal upholds the Respondent's third jurisdictional objection.\n\n**VI. FOURTH OBJECTION: COMPLIANCE WITH NOTICE AND AMICABLE SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARTICLE 2 CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nThe Respondent's final jurisdictional objection is that the Claimant failed, with respect to its Article 2 claims, to fulfil three pre-conditions for arbitration, namely (i) to give notice of the specific claim; (ii) to allow six months for amicable settlement from the date of that notice; and (iii) to make genuine efforts to engage in good faith negotiations for such a settlement. According to the Respondent, compliance with these conditions is a prerequisite to establishing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of a claim. It therefore maintains that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's Article 2 claims.493\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6274-305; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6562-567.\n\n458.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision in relation to the Respondent's third jurisdictional objection means, however, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Article 2 claims in any event, since Article 8 of the BIT confers jurisdiction only with regard to claims under Article 5 and claims concerning the amount, or arrangements for payment, of compensation under Article 4. That decision means that the conditions regarding notice, negotiations and amicable settlement in Article 8 are not applicable to the claims under Article 2. The Tribunal considers, therefore, that it is not called upon to decide whether or not compliance with those conditions would have been a prerequisite for jurisdiction, since such jurisdiction cannot exist in any event.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n459.\n\nThe effect of the Tribunal's decisions on the different jurisdictional objections is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all of the Claimant's claims, except for those under Article 5 of the BIT. As a result, the present award does not amount to a final disposal of the case. The Tribunal therefore reserves the question of costs to the next phase of the proceedings.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Rejects the Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection;\n\n(2) Rejects the Respondent\u2019s second jurisdictional objection;\n\n(3) Upholds the Respondent\u2019s third jurisdictional objection;\n\n(4) Considers it is not required to rule upon the Respondent\u2019s fourth jurisdictional objection;\n\n(5) Holds that it lacks jurisdiction over all aspects of the Claimant\u2019s claim other than the claim under Article 5 of the BIT; and\n\n(6) Reserves to itself all matters regarding further proceedings in the case."}, {"Title": "Second Award on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2014-06-04T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Second Award on Jurisdiction\n----------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A.** Parties\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this arbitration is the European American Investment Bank Aktiengesellschaft (hereinafter the \"Claimant\" or \"Euram Bank\"), a company established under the laws of Austria with its registered office at Palais Esterh\u00e1zy, Wallnerstrasse 4, 1010 Vienna, Austria. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nDr. Erhard Bohm, Specht B\u00f6hm Rechtsanwalt GmbH\n\nMr. Stanislav Du-rica, Ruzicka Csekes.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent in this arbitration is the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the \"Respondent,\" the \"Slovak Republic\" or \"Slovakia\"). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nMs. Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\nMr. Mark A Clodfelter, Foley Hoag LLP\n\nMr. David A Pawlak, David A Pawlak LLC\n\nMr. Constantinos Salonidis, Foley Hoag LLP\n\nMs. Diana Tsutieva, Foley Hoag LLP.\n\n**B.** Procedural History\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 23 November 2009, Euram Bank commenced arbitration proceedings against the Slovak Republic, pursuant to Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 15 December 1976 (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") and Article 8(2) of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated 15 October 1990 (the \"BIT\"). The BIT entered into force on 1 October 1991. The procedural history of the case and the constitution of the Tribunal are set out in detail in the Tribunal\u2019s First Award on Jurisdiction of 22 October 2012 (\"the First Award\"). Accordingly, the present Award sets out the procedural history prior to 22 October only to the extent necessary for an understanding of the present phase of the proceedings. The authentic Czech and German texts of the BIT, together with the English translations submitted by the Parties are attached to the First Award as Annexes 1-7. In paragraph 292 of the First Award, the Tribunal concluded that the differences between the translations advanced were not such as to affect the outcome of the jurisdictional objections considered then. The Tribunal affirms that the same is true with regard to the new jurisdictional objections that are the subject of this Award. The Tribunal will henceforth for convenience refer to the Respondent\u2019s translation from the German original (attached to the First Award as Annex 7) when quoting the provisions of the BIT in English.\n\n4.\n\nIn its Statement of Claim, Euram Bank claimed that changes in the law on health insurance in the Slovak Republic, adopted in 2007 and entering into force in 2008, had destroyed the value of its investment in a health insurance company called Chemicka zdravotn\u00e1 poist\u2019ov\u00f1a Apollo (\"Apollo\"). Euram Bank maintained that this action amounted to expropriation (within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT), as well as to a violation of the requirement of fair and equitable treatment in Article 2 of the BIT and of the provisions of Article 5 of the BIT regarding transfers. The factual background and the claim are set out in detail in the First Award.\n\n5.\n\nOn 5 November 2010, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence, which raised four objections (\"the original jurisdictional objections\") to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal:\n\n(1) that the arbitration provision of the BIT was no longer valid, because Austria and the Slovak Republic were both Member States of the European Union (\"EU\");\n\n(2) that Euram Bank\u2019s claims did not arise out of a qualifying investment;\n\n(3) that the claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT fell outside the scope of the arbitration provision of the BIT; and\n\n(4) that the claims for alleged breach of Article 2 of the BIT did not comply with conditions which were a prerequisite of jurisdiction.\n\nThese objections are described in greater detail in paragraph 48 of the First Award.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal ordered bifurcation of the proceedings and a hearing on the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections was held on 19 and 20 December 2011. While the Tribunal was considering its decision on the jurisdictional objections, the Respondent submitted, on 26 May 2012, a Supplementary Statement of Defence in which it raised fresh jurisdictional objections (\"the new jurisdictional objections\") arising out of proceedings instituted by the Claimant in the District Court of Bratislava I. Those objections are set out at paragraphs 87-89, below. After hearing the views of the Claimant, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on 8 June 2012, in which it stated that, as the work of drafting an award regarding the original jurisdictional objections discussed at the December 2011 hearing was already well advanced, the Tribunal would defer any consideration of the new jurisdictional objections until it had rendered an award on the original jurisdictional objections.\n\n7.\n\nIn the First Award, adopted on 22 October 2012, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent\u2019s first and second original jurisdictional objections but allowed the third original jurisdictional objection and concluded that it therefore lacked jurisdiction over all aspects of the Claimant's claim other than the claim under Article 5 of the BIT. The Tribunal held that it was unnecessary to pronounce on the fourth original jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal stated that the Award was \"without prejudice to the admissibility or the merits of the objections referred to in the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence\" (First Award, para. 39).\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 14 January 2013, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal schedule a procedural meeting for the purpose of establishing a timetable for the consideration of the new jurisdictional objections and, should the objections be rejected, the remainder of the proceedings up to the final hearing on the merits with regard to the Article 5 claim.\n\n9.\n\nOn 25 January 2013, the Claimant transmitted a joint draft procedural timetable covering the remaining jurisdictional phase and a possible merits phrase. On the same day, the Respondent confirmed its assent to the provisional timetable contained in the Claimant\u2019s letter but clarified that its participation in the proceedings was without prejudice to its continued objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on grounds rejected in the First Award and reserved its rights with respect to post-award remedies.\n\n10.\n\nOn 28 January 2013, the Tribunal conducted a procedural meeting with the Parties by telephone conference call.\n\n11.\n\nOn 31 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, which established a timetable for written submissions and a hearing on the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence as follows:\n\nThe Claimant shall file its Reply to the Supplementary Statement of Defence by 28 March 2013.\n\nThe Respondent shall file its Rejoinder to the Claimant\u2019s Reply by 23 May 2013.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction will be held at the Peace Palace in The Hague on 3 June 2013.\n\nThe precise duration of the hearing will be determined at a later date but it will not last longer than one day.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 March 2013, the Claimant filed its Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence (\"Reply\") and accompanying documents.\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 May 2013, the Claimant submitted a statement from Mr. Per Runeland, one of the Claimant\u2019s legal experts, regarding his \"past and present relations... with any Parties, Counsel or the Members of the Tribunal\" in accordance with the requirement of paragraph 5.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n14.\n\nOn 24 May 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Supplementary Statement of Defence (\"Rejoinder\") and accompanying documents.\n\n15.\n\nBy the letters dated 27 May 2013, and 28 May 2013, the Claimant objected to the scope and content of the Respondent's Rejoinder, submitted a document production request, and requested that the 3 June 2013 hearing be vacated. The Respondent opposed these applications by letter dated 28 May 2013. The Claimant responded by letter dated 29 May 2013.\n\n16.\n\nOn 30 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, recording the orders issued by the Presiding Arbitrator, on behalf of the Tribunal, during a 29 May 2013 telephone conference call as follows:\n\n3. Having carefully considered the [Parties\u2019] correspondence, the Tribunal has decided that the hearing scheduled for 3 June 2013 cannot proceed as planned. That hearing is hereby vacated.\n\n4. Considering the Claimant\u2019s request for an opportunity to make an additional written submission and, in particular, to respond to the Expert Opinions of Prof. Klucka and Prof. Heuman submitted by the Respondent, the Tribunal grants the Claimant leave to submit, by 31 July 2013:\n\n(i) a brief written submission, confined to responding to issues raised in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder that were not expressly dealt with in the Respondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence;\n\n(ii) an expert opinion on Slovak law, confined to responding to issues raised in the Expert Opinion of Prof. Klucka that were not expressly dealt with in the Respondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence; and\n\n(iii) a supplementary expert opinion by Mr. Runeland, confined to responding to issues raised in the Expert Opinion of Prof. Heuman that were not expressly dealt with in the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence or the prior Expert Opinion of Mr. Runeland.\n\n5. The Tribunal considers that, to the extent that Part V of the Respondent's Rejoinder (\"EURAM's Conduct Is Inconsistent With Its Duty To Arbitrate In Good Faith, And As Such Should Be Sanctioned By Dismissal For Lack Of Jurisdiction\") constitutes a separate jurisdictional objection, such objection has not been raised in a timely manner according to Articles 20 and 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules and is hereby dismissed.\n\n6. The Parties shall, by 21 August 2013, submit an agreed chronology of the steps taken in both the Slovak court proceedings and this arbitration, identifying where necessary any points of disagreement between them.\n\n7. The Respondent shall, by 7 June 2013, either produce the \"contract notice\" identified in the Claimant\u2019s letter dated 28 May 2013 or, if that \"contract notice\" does not exist, confirm that such is the case and furnish a brief explanation.\n\n8. By 2 September 2013, each Party shall inform the Tribunal and the other Party of the expert/s that it wishes to cross-examine at the hearing. In the absence of a request for cross-examination, such experts shall not be examined at the hearing.\n\n9. A hearing on jurisdiction will be held at the Peace Palace in The Hague on 16 September 2013, commencing at 9:00 am and finishing no later than 5:00 pm.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 3 June 2013, the Respondent explained that no \"contract notice\" as referred to in paragraph 7 of Procedural Order No. 6 exists. The Respondent at the same time requested that the 31 July 2013 deadline set forth in paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 6 for the Claimant's further submissions in response to the Respondent's Rejoinder be moved up to 15 July 2013. The Claimant opposed this application by letter dated 4 June 2013.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 5 June 2013, the Claimant requested (i) an English translation of Article IV of the Representation Agreement with Mr. Vozar (Exhibit R-18) and (ii) copies and translations of certain cases on which the Respondent\u2019s expert. Prof. Heuman, relied. The Respondent opposed these applications by letter dated 7 June 2013.\n\n19.\n\nOn 11 June 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, that modified the previous Procedural Order No. 6 as follows:\n\n3. Having carefully considered the [Parties\u2019 relevant correspondence], the Tribunal establishes 22 July 2013 as the new deadline for the Claimant\u2019s further submissions. Paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 6 is hereby amended accordingly.\n\n4. Having carefully considered the [Parties\u2019 relevant correspondence], the Tribunal issues the following decisions:\n\n(i) The Tribunal declines to order the Respondent to furnish an English translation of Article IV of the Representation Agreement with Mr. Vozar (R-18). If the Claimant considers that this Article is of significance for the issues currently before the Tribunal, it should submit its own translation of the Article with the further submissions referred to above;\n\n(ii) In order for the Tribunal to be able to assess for itself the cases that are cited by the Parties\u2019 experts on Swedish law (namely, Mr. Runeland and Prof. Heuman), each Party is required to provide the Tribunal with copies and full English translations of all cases cited and relied upon by their respective experts;\n\n(iii) To the extent that a full translation of any given case would be unduly burdensome, the Tribunal invites the Parties to agree on the portion that must be translated and, in case of disagreement, to apply to the Tribunal for a decision;\n\n(iv) Copies and translations of the cases cited in the existing Expert Opinions of Mr. Runeland and Prof. Heuman shall be submitted by the Parties by 2 July 2013; and\n\n(v) Copies and translations of the cases cited in the Supplementary Expert Opinion of Mr. Runeland shall be submitted together with that opinion by 22 July 2013.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 2 July 2013, the Respondent submitted certain updated and new exhibits and legal authorities, including new Exhibits R-33 to R-36.\n\n21.\n\nOn 22 July 2013, the Claimant submitted its Rebuttal to Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder (\"Rebuttal\") and accompanying documents. In its letter enclosing its Rebuttal, the Claimant also objected to the submission by the Respondent of Exhibits R-33 to R-36.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 31 July 2013, the Respondent responded to the Claimant\u2019s objection to its submission of Exhibits R-33 to R-36.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 6 August 2013, the Respondent registered its objections to certain sections of both the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal and the Supplemental Opinion of Mr. Per Runeland dated 19 July 2013 on the basis that these submissions exceeded the scope permitted by Procedural Order No. 6, and requested that these sections be excluded from the record. The Claimant opposed the Respondent\u2019s objections by letter dated 7 August 2013.\n\n24.\n\nOn 9 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, by which it decided as follows:\n\n2. Having carefully considered the [Parties' relevant correspondence], as well as reviewed the said exhibits, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s objection to Exhibits R-33 to R-36 and admits these documents into the record of these proceedings.\n\n3. While the submission of Exhibits R-33 to R-36 was not specifically authorized by the Tribunal, the Tribunal nevertheless admits these documents on the exceptional basis that they were not available to the Respondent at the time that it filed its Rejoinder and that they are relevant to the issues raised at this stage of the arbitration.\n\n4. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant would not be unduly prejudiced by the admission of these exhibits, and may address these documents at the 16 September 2013 hearing to the extent that it has not already done so in its prior written submissions.\n\n5. In relation to the Respondent\u2019s application to exclude from the record certain sections of the Claimant's Rebuttal submission as well as certain sections of Mr. Runeland\u2019s Supplemental Expert Opinion, the Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 6 August 2013 and the Claimant\u2019s letter dated 7 August 2013. The Tribunal invites a substantive response by the Claimant to the Respondent's application by 16 August 2013.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 14 August 2013, the Claimant responded to the Respondent\u2019s application to exclude from the record certain sections of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal and the Supplemental Expert Opinion of Mr. Runeland.\n\n26.\n\nOn 20 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, which stated as follows:\n\n1. The Tribunal notes the Parties\u2019 correspondence regarding the Respondent\u2019s application to exclude from the record certain sections of the Claimant's Rebuttal submission as well as certain sections of the Supplemental Expert Opinion of Mr. Runeland, including the Respondent's letter dated 6 August 2013, the Claimant\u2019s letter dated 7 August 2013, and the Claimant's letter dated 14 August 2013.\n\n2. The Tribunal also recalls the provisions of Procedural Order No. 6, whereby the Claimant was granted leave to make the following further written submissions beyond those foreseen in Procedural Order No. 5:\n\n\"(i) a brief written submission, confined to responding to issues raised in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder that were not expressly dealt with in the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence;\n\n(ii) an expert opinion on Slovak law, confined to responding to issues raised in the Expert Opinion of Prof. Klucka that were not expressly dealt with in the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence; and\n\n(iii) a supplementary expert opinion by Mr. Runeland, confined to responding to issues raised in the Expert Opinion of Prof. Heuman that were not expressly dealt with in the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence or the prior Expert Opinion of Mr. Runeland.\"\n\n3. Having carefully considered all of the above, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s application in respect of paragraphs 36-49, 62-66, 105-106, and 191-200 of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, which are hereby excluded from the record of this arbitration, and rejects the Respondent\u2019s application otherwise, for the following reasons:\n\n(i) As regards paragraphs 4, 9-21, and 28-35 of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, the Tribunal considers that these paragraphs respond to issues raised in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder that were not expressly dealt with in the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, namely the Respondent\u2019s argument that \"Article 20 creates a presumption under which supplementation of defences is permitted as a matter of right\" (paragraphs 189-198 of the Rejoinder). These submissions thus fall within the scope of paragraph 4(i) of Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n(ii) As regards paragraphs 64-66, 83, and 105-106 of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, the Tribunal considers that, with the exception of paragraph 83, these submissions fall outside the scope of paragraph 4(i) of Procedural Order No. 6. The issue of the sameness of the dispute before the Slovak courts and in this arbitration was expressly dealt with in the Supplementary Statement of Defence and was in any event already addressed in detail in the Claimant's Reply. On the other hand, paragraph 83 relates to expert evidence regarding the characterization of a claim as a matter of Slovak law in relation to the Claimant\u2019s argument that its action before the Slovak courts served a conservatory purpose (and the Respondent\u2019s refutation thereof in its Rejoinder), and therefore falls within the scope of paragraphs 4(i) and (ii) of Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n(iii) As regards paragraphs 36-63 of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal and paragraphs 42-51 of the Supplementary Expert Opinion of Mr. Runeland, the Tribunal considers that, with the exception of paragraphs 58-59 of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, these submissions fall outside the scope of paragraphs 4(i) and (iii) of Procedural Order No. 6. As the Claimant itself concedes, the issue of the Respondent\u2019s potential waiver of the right to invoke Claimant\u2019s waiver was not dealt with in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder and was already addressed in detail in the Claimant\u2019s Reply. Nevertheless, the Tribunal exceptionally admits paragraphs 50-61 of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal and paragraphs 42-51 of the Supplementary Expert Opinion of Mr. Runeland on the basis that they relate to a relevant legal authority that was not available to the Claimant at the time that it filed its Reply.\n\n(iv) As regards paragraphs 191-200 of the Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, the Tribunal considers that these paragraphs raise new arguments that were not dealt with in any of the Parties\u2019 prior written submissions and consequently fall outside the scope of paragraph 4(i) of Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n4. The above decision is issued in accordance with Article 22 (regarding further written statements) and Article 25(6) (regarding the admissibility of evidence) of the UNCITRAL Rules, as well the Tribunal\u2019s general discretion as to matters of procedure under Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal is unaware of any mandatory rule applicable to the arbitration which might preclude the Tribunal\u2019s issuance of this order in accordance with the abovementioned provisions of the UNCITRAL Rules, notwithstanding any discretion or duty the Tribunal may have to consider applicable law beyond the confines of the Parties\u2019 submissions. The Parties shall in any event each have a further opportunity to develop their arguments and rebut the other Party\u2019s arguments orally at the hearing.\n\n27.\n\nBy e-mail of 21 August 2013, pursuant to paragraph 8 of Procedural Order No. 6, the Claimant submitted an agreed chronology of the steps taken in the Slovak court proceedings. The Respondent confirmed the Parties' agreement on the chronology by e-mail of the same date.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 23 August 2013, the Respondent sent the Tribunal a letter on behalf of the Parties recording their agreement on the organization of the hearing set for 16 September 2013. The Claimant confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreement by later e-mail of the same date. On this day as well, the Presiding Arbitrator conducted a pre-hearing meeting with the Parties by telephone conference call.\n\n29.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, the Tribunal held a second hearing on jurisdiction at the Peace Palace, The Hague, the Netherlands.

An agreed chronology of the events in both this arbitration and the Slovak court proceedings is appended to this Award as Annex A.\n\n*Commencement of the Arbitration*\n---------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nEuram Bank commenced the arbitration proceedings on 23 November 2009. On 5 November 2010, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence and Request for Bifurcation in the arbitration.\n\n*The Petition for the Commencement of Proceedings in the District Court Bratislava I*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nOn 22 November 2010, the Claimant filed a Petition for the Commencement of Proceedings against the National Council of the Slovak Republic in the Bratislava Court.1 The Petition referred to the same developments in the law on health insurance which form the factual basis for the claim in the arbitration. After reciting those facts, the Petition stated:\n\nIn our opinion, the Slovak Republic breached its obligations under the relevant provisions of the Treaty between the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic and the Republic of Austria concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 15 October 1990 (hereinafter as the \"Investment Protection Treaty\"), which are outlined below in this Petition for the Commencement of Proceedings.2\n\nThe Investment Protection Treaty referred to in this passage is the BIT on which the Claimant bases its case in the present arbitration proceedings. The Petition went on to allege violations of Articles 2, 4 and 5 of the BIT, which were the same provisions relied upon by the Claimant in its 2009 Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim. The sum claimed in the Petition, EUR 131,400,000,\u20193 was the same as the sum claimed in the arbitration.\n\nExhibit RL-344 (\"Petition\").\n\nExhibit RL-344, para. 11.\n\nExhibit RL-344, paras. 12 and 122.\n\n33.\n\nThe Petition made clear that the Claimant had also brought arbitration proceedings regarding the same facts. Thus, immediately after the passage quoted above, the Petition went on to state:\n\nUsing the identical legal reasoning as in this Petition for the Commencement of Proceedings, on 23 November 2009 the Claimant initiated an arbitration proceedings [sic] against the Slovak Republic under Article 8 of the Investment Protection Treaty. Recently, the arbitration tribunal has been successfully set up and the matter in question is pending decision.4\n\nThe Claimant went on to state that it had filed the Petition in reaction to the award in *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic* (9 October 2009), in which an arbitration tribunal had held that it lacked jurisdiction in respect of a claim for alleged expropriation brought under the same BIT5 The Claimant stated that the Respondent in the present arbitration would raise objections to jurisdiction similar to those which had succeeded in *Austrian Airlines.* The Petition continued:\n\nThe Claimant is of the opinion that the Arbitration Tribunal does have the competence to decide on the matter, however, the session of the Arbitration Tribunal that will also deal with the issue of competence will take place as late as in August 2011. The Claimant believes that the primary forum for its claims to be raised and decided on is the Arbitration, however, the decision on the competence of the arbitration tribunal will most likely not be issued before the end of 2011. The Claimant therefore decided to file this Petition for the Commencement of Proceedings in order to protect and reserve its rights, including avoiding the possibility of its right to pecuniary performance from the Slovak Republic becoming statute-barred or extinguished.6\n\nExhibit RL-344, para. 13.\n\n*The Austrian Airlines* award is discussed in paras. 374 and 438 of the First Award.\n\nExhibit RL-344, para. 15.\n\n34.\n\nIn addition to alleging violations of the BIT, the Petition also maintained that the change in the law on health insurance breached the provisions of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic7 and the European Convention on Human Rights.8\n\nExhibit RL-344, paras. 18-26,46-58 and 72.\n\nExhibit RL-344, paras. 27-9, 59-71 and 74.\n\n35.\n\nThe Petition concluded with a Petition for the Suspension of Proceedings.9 This Petition had two parts. First, the Claimant requested the suspension of proceedings under Section 109(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure, \"due to the referral of the case to the Constitutional Court to deliver an opinion whether the generally binding law which is connected with the merits of the dispute is in contradiction with the Slovak Constitution and/or with an international treaty binding for the Slovak Republic.\"10 Secondly, the Claimant sought suspension of the proceedings, under Section 109(2)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure, pending a decision from the Tribunal. This second request was couched in the following terms:\n\nIf the District Court Bratislava I will come to the conclusion that the conditions stated in Section 109(1)(b) of the CCP are not met, we propose that the District Court Bratislava I will, due to grounds described in paragraphs 13 to 15 hereof adopt a resolution pursuant to section 109(2)(c) of the CCP and issue the suspension of this proceedings (sic] until the proceedings described in paragraphs 13 to 15 hereof will be completed.11\n\nThe proceedings described in paragraphs 13 to 15 deal with a question which may have relevance for the decision of the Court, namely the question of expropriation or forced restriction of ownership rights of the Claimant by the interference of the Slovak Republic in the form of adoption of the [Slovak legislation on health insurance], as well as the question concerning the obligation of the Slovak Republic to pay to the Claimant compensation for the breach of certain provisions of the Investment Protection Treaty.12\n\n*Developments between the Filing of the Petition in the District Court and the December 2011 Jurisdiction Hearing of the Tribunal*\n\nExhibit RL-344, paras. 91-121.\n\nExhibit RL-344, para. 116.\n\nExhibit RL-344, para. 120. The translation renders the last clause as \"until the proceedings described in paragraphs 13 to 15 hereof will not be completed.\" The word \"not\" is clearly an error in the translation or the typing of the document.\n\nExhibit RL-344, para. 121.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant did not inform the Tribunal or the Respondent that it had filed the Petition. In its Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, the Claimant stated that:\n\nThe Claimant saw no reason to inform the Tribunal of the Petition, a petition in which it had informed the Court that the Tribunal, and not the Court, had jurisdiction. In November 2011 Claimant considered the Petition as irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as it considers it irrelevant today.13\n\nCounsel for the Claimant repeated this position at the hearing on 16 September 2013.14\n\nReply, para. 39.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 187.\n\n37.\n\nIn accordance with Slovak procedural law, it was for the District Court to serve the Petition upon the National Council. As explained below, that was not done for several months. As a result, at the time that the next steps were taken in the arbitration proceedings, neither the Tribunal, nor the Respondent was aware of the existence of the Petition.\n\n38.\n\nBefore the Respondent became aware of the proceedings in the District Court, the following steps were taken in the arbitration proceedings:\n\n- On 30 November 2010, i.e. one week after the filing of the Petition, the Claimant agreed to the bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n- On 2 December 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which provided for bifurcation and laid down a timetable for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings.\n\n- On 22 February 2011, the Respondent submitted, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, its Memorial on Jurisdiction and accompanying documents.\n\n39.\n\nOn 13 May 2011, the Bratislava Court served the Petition on National Council of the Slovak Republic, the body designated as the defendant in the Petition. The Petition was accompanied by the Court Resolution dated 6 May 2011, and requested that the National Council respond to the Petition within 15 days.15\n\nExhibit RL-399.\n\n40.\n\nOn 14 May 2011, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction in the arbitration.\n\n41.\n\nOn 20 May 2011, the National Council submitted its First Time Extension Request to the Bratislava Court asking for more time to reply to the Petition, owing to its \"seriousness and extent.\"16 On 14 June 2011, the Bratislava Court granted the First Time Extension Request and gave the National Council until 14 July 2011 to reply to the Petition.17\n\nExhibit CL-201.\n\nExhibit R-15.\n\n42.\n\nOn 16 June 2011, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction in the arbitration. In that Reply, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Claimant had commenced proceedings in the District Court of Bratislava I and complained that this conduct was at odds with the Claimant\u2019s position in the arbitration that it had no remedies open to it in the courts of Slovakia.18\n\nReply of 16 June 2011, paras. 5 and 363-366.\n\n43.\n\nOn 7 July 2011, the National Council presented its Second Time Extension Request to the Bratislava Court asking for another extension of time in order to conduct a tender for legal services.\"19 The Bratislava Court granted this request on 14 July 2011 and set a new deadline of 14 October 2011 for the reply.\n\nExhibit CL-203.\n\n44.\n\nOn 18 July 2011, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction in the arbitration. In response to the passages in the Reply regarding its action in the Slovak courts, the Claimant stated that it had initiated the proceedings in the District Court as a precautionary measure and had informed the Court that it considered the arbitration to be the primary forum.20 It added:\n\nFurthermore, in view of the pending arbitration, Euram Bank asked the district court to suspend its proceedings until the Tribunal's award on jurisdiction. Almost eight months have passed now and the district court has not yet decided on Euram Bank\u2019s request. The case is in a state of de facto suspension. Euram Bank\u2019s Statement of Claim was served on the National Council acting on behalf of the Slovak Republic on 13 May 2011. Interestingly, the Slovak Republic requested an extension of the time for filing the Statement in Defence until 14 July 2011 which, coincidentally or not, is the time by which Euram Bank must file his Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.21\n\nRejoinder of 18 July 2011. paras. 202-3.\n\nRejoinder of 18 July 2011, para. 205.\n\n45.\n\nOn 3 August 2011, the Claimant responded to the Second Time Extension Request and requested that the Bratislava Court reconsider its 14 July 2011 decision and set a shorter deadline for the reply.22 The Claimant argued that the extension of time breached its rights in the Slovak proceedings and was contrary to the principle of procedural economy. The Claimant referred to the hearing which was due to take place before the Tribunal on 24-28 August 2011. It did not, however, mention the fact that on 12 July 201 I the Claimant had filed its second challenge to Professor Stern. That challenge was still under consideration by the Secretary-General of the PCA, as the appointing authority, on 3 August 2011. While the challenge was subsequently rejected (on 15 August 2011), at the time that it filed its opposition to the Second Time Extension Request, the Claimant was actively pursuing a challenge which, had it succeeded, would inevitably have resulted in a significant postponement of the jurisdictional hearing before the Tribunal, as the Tribunal would have had to be reconstituted and a new member given time to read the substantial pleadings and more than 1,000 exhibits and legal authorities already filed by the Parties. The Tribunal has not been informed of any response by the District Court to this submission by the Claimant.\n\nExhibit R-I4.\n\n46.\n\nThe jurisdictional hearing was later postponed (by decision of the Presiding Arbitrator notified to the Parties on 10 August 2011) and re-scheduled for 19-20 December 2011. That postponement had been requested by the Respondent on 4 August 2011, i.e. the day after the Claimant filed its opposition to the request for extension of time with the District Court, on account of the delay occasioned by the challenge proceedings. The Claimant opposed that request by letter of 8 August 2011.23\n\nSee the First Award, paras. 17-22.\n\n47.\n\nOn 2 September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 in the arbitration and subsequently invited Austria, the Czech Republic and the European Commission to file *amicus curiae* briefs on the lntra-EU BIT Issue.\n\n48.\n\nOn 12 October 2011, the National Council submitted a Third Time Extension Request to the Bratislava Court.24 On 20 October 2011, the Bratislava Court granted this request and set a new deadline of 29 February 2012 for the reply.25\n\nExhibit R-16.\n\nExhibit R-17.\n\n49.\n\nOn 13 October 2011, 28 October 2011, and 1 November 2011, respectively, the European Commission, the Republic of Austria, and the Czech Republic submitted their observations on the lntra-EU BIT Issue in the arbitration.\n\n50.\n\nOn 21 November 2011, a pre-hearing telephone conference call was held between the Tribunal and the Parties in preparation for the jurisdictional hearing in the arbitration. At this conference call:\n\nThe Respondent informed the Tribunal and the Claimant of the possibility that certain developments in connection with Claimant's lawsuit in the Slovak courts might lead the Respondent to raise further jurisdictional objections related to those new developments.26\n\nMinutes of Pre-Hearing Conference, para. 12.\n\n51.\n\nOn 30 November 2011, the Parties submitted their comments on the *amici curiae* submissions in the arbitration.\n\n52.\n\nOn 19-20 December 2011, the first jurisdictional hearing in the arbitration took place. In response to a question from the Presiding Arbitrator, counsel for the Respondent said, at the outset of the hearing:\n\nwe alluded in our pre-hearing conference call with you to the possibility that facts would emerge which would give rise to a possible objection to jurisdiction. All we can say right now is that those facts have not yet emerged and so we really have nothing more to say on that issue at this point. If they do and when they do, we will promptly inform the Tribunal and of course the Claimant.27\n\nFirst Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (19 December 2011), pp. 4-5.\n\n53.\n\nThe hearing then proceeded without reference to any implications which the Slovak proceedings might have for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n*Developments following the December 2011 Jurisdiction Hearing*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 20 January 2012, the National Council of the Slovak Republic and JUDr. Voz\u00e1r entered into a Contract for Legal Representation and Legal Services for the representation of the Respondent in the Bratislava Court.28 On 27 January 2012, the National Council granted JUDr. Voz\u00e1r Power of Attorney.29\n\nExhibit R-18\n\nExhibit R-19.\n\n55.\n\nOn 29 February 2012, the National Council filed its Reply in the Slovak court proceedings, which was delivered to the Bratislava Court on 1 March 2012.30 In this document, the National Council maintained that it was not the proper defendant in the proceedings, that the Court could not designate a different defendant and that \"this logical contradiction can be eliminated only by the Claimant designating an authority having legal personality as the authority to act on behalf of the Slovak Republic.\"31 The National Council also maintained that the BIT was invalid because it was contrary to European Union law and asserted that this was a matter which could not be decided by the District Court but which should be made the subject of a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") for a preliminary ruling, pursuant to Article 234 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the \"TFEU\"). The Respondent therefore requested that the District Court suspend the proceedings pending a ruling from the CJEU.\n\nExhibit R-20.\n\nExhibit R-20, p. 2.\n\n56.\n\nOn 5 March 2012, the National Council made an additional submission to the Bratislava Court concerning the views of the Commission of the European Union regarding the compatibility of BITs with EU law.32\n\nExhibit R-21.\n\n57.\n\nBy letter dated 3 April 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal in the arbitration of the filing of the National Council\u2019s Reply in the Bratislava Court. In that letter, the Respondent stated as follows:\n\nThe National Council objected to the jurisdiction of the national court on grounds of the incompatibility between the provisions of the treaty and EU law. According to the National Council's submission, that incompatibility affects the validity of the legal basis of the alleged obligation of the Slovak Republic and hence has a preliminary character vis-\u00e0-vis the determination of the latter's liability.\n\n58.\n\nBy letter dated 4 April 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Slovak Republic\u2019s action to set aside the *Eureko B.* V v. *The Slovak Republic* award in the Frankfurt Court.\n\n59.\n\nBy letters dated 13 April 2012, the Parties submitted further comments on the matters raised in the Parties\u2019 letters dated 3 April 2012 and 4 April 2012. The Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 April contained the following statement:\n\nAs announced, the reply statement [see para. 55, above] defends on grounds of the incompatibility between the provisions of the Treaty and EU law, and requested that the national court refer to the Court of Justice of the European Communities... the question whether provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU... prevent the application of the Treaty.\n\n60.\n\nOn 18 April 2012, the Claimant formally accepted service of the Reply in the Bratislava Court proceedings by obtaining a copy of it from the court file. Prior to that date, it had not seen the text of the Reply.\n\n61.\n\nOn 25 May 2012, the Respondent filed its Supplementary Statement of Defence, in which it raised the new jurisdictional objections. In that Statement, the Respondent referred to the Reply in the Bratislava District Court and stated that \"in its Reply, the National Council also objected to the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court on grounds of the incompatibility between the provisions of the Treaty and EU law\".33 However, it went on to refer to \"the National Council's Reply, in which the Slovak Republic submits to the Bratislava Court's jurisdiction over the dispute\".34\n\nSupplementary Statement of Defence, para. 6.\n\nSupplementary Statement of Defence, para. 12.\n\n62.\n\nOn 6 June 2012, the Respondent submitted additional evidence to the Bratislava Court relating to the motion to stay proceedings. [REDACTED]\n\n63.\n\nOn 8 June 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 in which it stated that, as the work of drafting an award regarding the original jurisdictional objections discussed at the December 2011 hearing was already well advanced, the Tribunal would defer any consideration of the new jurisdictional objections until it had rendered an award on the original jurisdictional objections.\n\n64.\n\nOn 16 July 2012, the Claimant submitted a statement to the Bratislava District Court addressing the National Council\u2019s statement that was delivered to the Court on 1 March 2012.36 In this statement, the Claimant maintained that the defendant in the proceedings in the District Court was the Slovak Republic itself (i.e. the Respondent in this arbitration) and that it was not seeking to argue that the National Council was itself liable. It also contended that there was no case for a preliminary reference to the CJEU. The statement concluded:\n\nIt appears to us that we have provided sufficient evidence that the Investment Protection Agreement applies to the legal relation involved in these proceedings, and there is no contradiction between this Investment Protection Agreement and EU law, and therefore we request the District Court of Bratislava to dismiss Respondent\u2019s request to suspend the proceedings and award a decision on the dispute in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Protection Agreement, which governs the legal relationship between Claimant and Respondent, as well as the claim brought by Claimant against Respondent in these proceedings.37\n\nExhibit R-23.\n\nExhibit R-23, p. 10.\n\n65.\n\nOn 8 August 2012, the Claimant submitted a statement to the Bratislava Court addressing the further evidence produced by the National Council in relation to the request to suspend proceedings.38\n\nExhibit R-24.\n\n66.\n\nOn 18 September 2012. the National Council submitted to the Bratislava Court a notice of change of legal representation along with a request for 30 days to review the file.\n\n67.\n\nOn 18 October 2012, the National Council requested the Bratislava Court to issue a decision on the requested suspension of the proceedings.\n\n68.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, the Tribunal issued its First Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n69.\n\nOn 31 October 2012, the Bratislava Court issued a request to the Claimant to inform the Court within 10 days whether it maintained its application for a stay of proceedings under Section 109(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure39 in view of the finding of the Constitutional Court in its judgment delivered on 24 March 2011.40 The request made no mention of the other motion for suspension of the proceedings, which had been made under Section 109(2)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure and asked the District Court to suspend the proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration (see paragraph 35, above).\n\nExhibit R-31.\n\nThis judgment is reviewed in paras. 389-406 of the First Award.\n\n70.\n\nOn 16 November 2012, the Claimant replied to the 31 October 2012 request of the Bratislava Court.41 Its reply confirmed that it still sought suspension of the proceedings under Section 109(1)(b). It did not mention the Section 109(2)(c) motion, nor did it refer to the arbitration proceedings or to the First Award on Jurisdiction.\n\nExhibit R-32.\n\n71.\n\nOn 7 January 2013, the Bratislava Court issued a ruling that (i) rejected the motion of the Claimant under Section 109(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure for the suspension of proceedings and the referral of the action to the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic; (ii) rejected the motion of the Respondent for the suspension of the proceedings and submission of a preliminary reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union; (iii) rejected the motion of the Respondent for the suspension of the proceedings pursuant to Section 109(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure; and (iv) rejected the motion of the Respondent for the suspension of the proceedings pursuant to Section 109(2)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure.42\n\nExhibit R-25.\n\n72.\n\nIn its Judgment, the District Court recited the statement made by the Claimant in its Petition (see paragraph 35, above) regarding the arbitration proceedings but made no mention of the Claimant\u2019s motion for suspension of the proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration. The Court noted that \"the decision on jurisdiction [of the arbitration tribunal] was not yet issued at the time of filing the motion\".43\n\nExhibit R-25, p. 2.\n\n73.\n\nOn 14 January 2013, the Claimant submitted a motion for evidence and the disclosure of information.44 This motion sought disclosure of the award of the arbitration tribunal in *Achmea BV* v. *Slovak Republic* (7 December 2012), which was the merits phase of the proceedings originally known as *Eureko BV v. Slovak Republic,* on the ground that it might be used as evidence in the Bratislava proceedings.\n\nExhibit R-26.\n\n74.\n\nOn the same day, 14 January 2013, the Claimant also wrote to the Tribunal requesting that the Tribunal determine a schedule for addressing the Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence. Having ascertained the views of the Parties, on 31 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order \"No. 5 by which it fixed a schedule for the submission of written arguments regarding the new jurisdictional objections.\n\n75.\n\nOn 31 January 2013, both the Claimant and the Respondent submitted appeals against the 7 January 2013 Ruling of the Bratislava Court.45 Neither appeal mentioned the arbitration proceedings or the First Award. The Claimant\u2019s appeal made no mention of the failure of the District Court to address its motion for the suspension of proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration.\n\nExhibit R-27; Exhibit R-28.\n\n76.\n\nOn 22 February 2013, the Bratislava Court served the Respondent\u2019s appeal on the Claimant, and afforded it an opportunity to submit a response to this appeal within 10 days.\n\n77.\n\nOn 28 February 2013, the Claimant requested an extension of time to submit a response to the Respondent\u2019s appeal.46\n\nExhibit R-33.\n\n78.\n\nOn 4 March 2013, the Respondent submitted a response to the Claimant\u2019s appeal of the ruling of the Bratislava Court, which was delivered to the Court on 6 March 2013.47\n\nExhibit R-29.\n\n79.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, the Respondent submitted a constitutional complaint to the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic.48\n\nExhibit R-30.\n\n80.\n\nOn 28 March 2013, the Claimant submitted its Reply to the Supplementary Statement of Defence in the arbitration proceedings.\n\n81.\n\nOn 3 April 2013, the Claimant submitted a response to the Respondent\u2019s appeal of 1 February 2013.49 The response referred to the award on jurisdiction in *Eureko BV* v. *Slovak Republic* but not to the First Award in the present proceedings.50\n\nExhibit R-34.\n\nExhibit R-34, p. 4 and fn. 8.\n\n82.\n\nOn 16 April 2013, the Constitutional Court issued a ruling on the constitutional complaint submitted by the Respondent in which it dismissed the Respondent\u2019s application.51\n\nExhibit R-35.\n\n83.\n\nOn 24 May 2013, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Supplementary Statement of Defence.\n\n84.\n\nOn 28 June 2013, the Respondent submitted its Supplementary Response to the Claimant\u2019s Appeal against the ruling of the Bratislava Court of 7 January 2013.52\n\nExhibit R-36.\n\n85.\n\nOn 13 September 2013, the Regional Court of Bratislava dismissed the appeals by the Claimant and the Respondent against the District Court\u2019s judgment of 7 January 2013.53 The judgment of the Regional Court recited the statement in the Claimant\u2019s 2010 Petition that it regarded the arbitration proceedings as the primary forum and noted that, at the time the Petition was filed, the Arbitral Tribunal had not decided upon its jurisdiction. It did not refer to the First Award.\n\nExhibit R-37.\n\n86.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, the second hearing on jurisdiction was held in the arbitration proceedings.\n\n**II. THE ISSUES CONSIDERED IN THE PRESENT AWARD**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent raises two jurisdictional objections in the present phase of the proceedings.\n\n88.\n\nFirst, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant\u2019s act of commencing the proceedings in the District Court Bratislava I and the Respondent\u2019s filing of its substantive defence in that case gave rise to an agreement between the Parties that the case should henceforth be resolved in the Slovak courts, not in the arbitration proceedings. According to the Respondent, the result was that the Tribunal was deprived of jurisdiction, since Article 8(2) of the BIT, which is the basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, provides that \"the dispute shall, *unless otherwise agreed,* be decided... by way of arbitral proceedings\" (emphasis added). The Respondent maintains that this agreement was concluded on 18 April 2012 when the Claimant received the Reply which the Respondent had filed with the District Court in response to the Claimant\u2019s Petition (see paragraphs 32-35, 38, 55 and 60, above).\n\n89.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent contends that, irrespective of whether any agreement was concluded between the Parties, the Claimant\u2019s acts constitute a waiver of the right to arbitrate. This second objection is put in two ways: (a) that the filing of the Petition to Commence Proceedings in the District Court was itself sufficient to amount to a waiver; and (b) that the Claimant\u2019s conduct, taken as a whole, constitutes a waiver.\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal render an award:\n\n*i.* in favour of the Slovak Republic and against the Claimant, dismissing the Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction in their entirety and with prejudice; and\n\n*ii.* pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, ordering that the Claimant bear all the costs of the arbitration, including the Respondent\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance, together with interest thereon.54\n\nRespondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 24; Rejoinder, para. 216.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the Respondent\u2019s objections were raised too late. It contends that there is no right for a party to raise jurisdictional objections after it has filed its Statement of Defence and that, even if there were such a right, the Respondent delayed for too long, after becoming aware of the Petition in the District Court and thus waived its right to object.\n\n92.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal should reject its submission that the new jurisdictional objections were raised too late, the Claimant maintains that the objections should be dismissed. It contends that no agreement to resolve the dispute in the Slovak courts was concluded and that its conduct, whether confined to the filing of the Petition or taken as a whole, did not amount to a waiver of its right to arbitrate the dispute.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal render an award:\n\ni. in favour of the Claimant and against the Respondent, dismissing the Respondent's jurisdictional objections raised in the Supplementary Statement of Defence in their entirety and with prejudice; and\n\nii. ordering that the Respondent bear all the costs of this arbitration, including the Claimant\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance, together with interest.55\n\nReply, para. 110; Rebuttal, para. 202.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal will address these issues in the following order. First, the Tribunal will examine the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Respondent\u2019s new jurisdictional objections have been raised too late and thus cannot be entertained (Part III of the Award). Secondly, the Tribunal will consider the first objection, namely that the Parties have \"agreed otherwise\", within the meaning of Article 8(2) of the BIT (Part IV of the Award). Thirdly, the Tribunal will turn to the Respondent\u2019s waiver objection (Part V of the Award). The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions and order are set out in Part VI.\n\n**III. WHETHER THE NEW JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED TOO LATE**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** The Positions of the Parties\n-----------------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant***\n---------------------\n\n95.\n\nArticle 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that jurisdictional objections must be raised \"not later than in the Statement of Defence\".56 The Claimant contends that, while Article 21(3) does not specify when a jurisdictional objection which only arises after the Statement of Defence must be raised, it implicitly requires such objections to be raised at the earliest possible opportunity.57 This applies with special force to an arbitration that is already at an advanced stage and in which the tribunal has bifurcated the proceedings so as to treat jurisdictional objections as preliminary questions.58\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 28.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 29.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 30.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimant discusses three cases in support of this proposition: first, the tribunal in *CME Czech Republic BV* v. *The Czech Republic* found that Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules deemed waived a jurisdictional objection based on a point that had been raised for the first time at the hearing;59 secondly, the *Alucoal* tribunal noted that Article 5(1)(i) of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce Arbitration Rules, which is substantially similar to Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, required a jurisdictional objection based on the waiver of the arbitration agreement to be raised in the Statement of Defence at the latest;60 and thirdly, the tribunal in *Chevron Research Co.* v. *National Iranian Oil Co.* found a jurisdictional objection to have been raised too late under Article 21(3) of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal Rules on the basis that it had only been raised during a pre-hearing conference some months after the Statement of Defence.61\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 31, citing Exhibit RL-134, paras. 378-380.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 32, citing CL-223.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 33. citing CL-224, p. 464.\n\n97.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant notes that the Supplementary Statement of Defence was filed over a year after the Respondent had notice of the allegedly new facts.62 The Claimant rejects the suggestion that what it describes as the Respondent\u2019s \"cryptical allusions\" made in the pre-hearing conference call and at the December 2011 jurisdictional hearing were sufficient to preserve its later ability to object.63\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 34.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, paras. 34-35; Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 104.\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules only provides for amendments to the Statement of Claim or Defence in respect of substantive claims and defences and that it does not apply to jurisdictional objections.\"64 According to the Claimant, none of the cases or other legal materials cited by the Respondent provide otherwise. The Claimant also contends that prejudice to the opposing party is likely to be caused not by amendments that modify arguments but by those that modify either the factual circumstances of the argument or the relief sought.65\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, paras. 9-14, citing David Caron *el al., The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* (Oxford 2006), pp. 470-477 (Exhibit RL-451) (\"Caron (2006)'') (stating that \u2018\u2018the first sentence of Article 20 regulates situations where the amendment alters the subject matter of the original claim as defined in the statement of claim\"). Article 20 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) reads as follows: \"During the course of the arbitral proceedings either party may amend or supplement his claim or defence unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances. However, a claim may not be amended in such a manner that the amended claim falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause or separate arbitration agreement.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 15-21, referring to *Ethyl Corporation* v. *Canada, Riahi* v. *Iran, Malek* v. *Iran, Himpurna California Energy Ltd. v. Indonesia,* and *UPS* v. *Canada.*\n\n99.\n\nBut even were Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules applicable to this issue, the Claimant argues that the Supplementary Statement of Defence should be dismissed because of the undue delay of the Respondent in raising its jurisdictional objections.66\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 22.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's explanation for this delay - which is that the Petition was complex and required a lengthy process of procuring Slovak counsel which culminated in the engagement of Mr. Voz\u00e1r on 20 January 2012 - and alleges that there was, in fact, no public procurement process at all.67 First, the Claimant points out that there is no evidence that the Respondent did anything at all between 13 May 2011, when the Petition was served on the Respondent, and 7 July 2011, which is when the Respondent filed its second time extension request in order to conduct a public procurement process for legal counsel.68 Secondly, the Claimant notes that when the Respondent filed its third extension request on 12 October 2011 (152 days after the service of the Petition), the Respondent still had not commenced a formal public procurement process, but \"made the Court believe it had\" when it said that it had \"dispatched\" a \"preliminary notice of publication of tender.\"69\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 23-24; Claimant\u2019s Reply paras. 6-8, 106, citing Request for Extension of Time of 20 May 2011, Exhibit CL-201 (referring to the fact that Respondent considered the Petition complex) and Request for Extension of Time of 7 July 2011, Exhibit CL-203 (referring to its alleged need to tender for legal services).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 148-150.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, paras. 151-153.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimant submits that a Slovak public procurement process commences with the publication of a \"contract notice,\" which the Respondent admits was never published.70 Instead, the Respondent proceeded to award the contract to Mr. Voz\u00e1r to represent the Respondent in the Slovak court proceedings as well as seven other cases directly by way of the small contract exception under Article 102 PPA which is not subject to any of the procedures, statutory periods, or revision periods invoked in support of its extension requests.71 According to the Claimant, the Respondent could have directly hired Mr. Voz\u00e1r within a few days of the Petition being served in May 2011,72\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 154, citing the Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 28 May 2013, p. 2 and the Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 3 June 2013, p. 1. The Claimant rejects the explanation of the Respondent that there was no contract notice because the newly elected government had opted against a formal tender process as a method for procuring counsel by explaining that the new government of Prime Minister Fico took office on 4 April 2012, which was two and a half months after the contract with Mr Voz\u00e1r was signed. *Id.*\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, paras. 155-158, citing Rejoinder, para. 26; Articles 2, 101, Exhibit R-18; Act No 25/2006 Coll, on Public Procurement and on the Amendment of Certain Acts, as in force until 31 December 2011, Exhibit CL-229.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 159.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Respondent did not in fact need to engage Mr. Voz\u00e1r or any Slovak counsel to assess whether the Petition of the Claimant amounted to a waiver of its right to arbitration.73 The Claimant argues that the Respondent admitted as much in its Rejoinder.74 Moreover, the Claimant submits that no Slovak lawyer was necessary in respect of the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the *lex arbitri* characterizes the mere filing of the Petition to be a waiver of the right to arbitration or that the Parties had agreed that the dispute would be settled otherwise than by arbitration, within the meaning of Article 8(2) of the BIT.75 The Claimant adds that it is inconceivable that the Respondent would have taken a different view on EU law and the validity of the BIT in the Bratislava Court proceedings from the position it had already extensively argued in the arbitration, and these arguments constituted the totality of the Respondent\u2019s eventual Reply to the Petition.76\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 25-26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 25-27, citing Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 199-201.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 188-190; Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 106.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 186-187; Claimant's Reply, paras. 106-107; Second Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), pp. 205:2-11.\n\n103.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent demonstrated its intent to waive any jurisdictional objections based on the Petition by foregoing various opportunities to raise them: (a) after the Petition had been served (13 May 2011); (b) when the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction in the arbitration proceedings (16 June 2011); (c) between the filing of the Reply on Jurisdiction and the filing of the Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (on 18 July 2011); and (d) between the filing of the Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the jurisdictional hearing (on 19 and 20 December 2011).\u201977 In fact, the Claimant notes that the Respondent itself made vague allusions at the pre-hearing conference call on 21 November 2011 and at the hearing in December 2011 to new developments in the Bratislava Court proceedings (which would eventually form the basis of its Supplementary Statement of Defence) and yet did not raise any jurisdictional objections, despite seven months having passed since it received the Petition.78 The Claimant further points to the Respondent's letters of 3 and 13 April 2012 where the Respondent again alludes to supposed new developments including the Respondent\u2019s Reply in the Bratislava Court, but fails to assert any clear jurisdictional objection.79\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras, 101-104.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 14-16. 104.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 17-22, 105.\n\n104.\n\nFinally, the Claimant refers to the recent Swedish Supreme Court decision in *Technopromexport* v. *Mir's Ltd,* where the Court found that Technopromexport had waived its jurisdictional objection on the basis of the invalidity of the arbitration agreement, as it had failed diligently to investigate and then assert a clear and specific jurisdictional objection at the earliest possible time.80 The Claimant argues that the Respondent has similarly failed to show diligence in assessing and asserting any alleged effect of the Bratislava Court proceedings on this Tribunal's jurisdiction and that the Respondent is thereby precluded from now asserting its new jurisdictional objections.81\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 50-54, citing *Technopromexport* v. *Mir's Ltd.,* Judgment dated 14 June 2013, Case No. T2104-12, Swedish Supreme Court, pp. 5, 10 (Exhibit CL-226).\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, paras. 55-61, citing Runeland Supplemental Opinion, p. 5; Claimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 107-108.\n\n***2. The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules permits amendments to claims and defences as of right, and authorizes tribunals to reject these amendments only if these were excessively delayed and have caused prejudice to the opposing party.82 According to the Respondent, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of Article 20 support this interpretation,83 as do the decisions of international tribunals in *Ethyl Corporation v. Canada,84 Riahi v. Iran,85 Malek v. Iran,86 Himpurna California Energy Ltd.,87* and *UPS v. Canada.88* In addition, the Respondent notes that the 2010 version of the UNCITRAL Rules has now explicitly clarified that a tribunal may admit jurisdictional objections later than the Statement of Defence if \"it considers the delay justified.\"89 Accordingly, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal can disallow the jurisdictional objections in the Supplementary Statement of Defence only if it finds (i) undue delay, (ii) prejudice to the Claimant, or (iii) other serious circumstances justifying a denial.90 The Respondent contends that none of these are present in this case.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 190-191, citing UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976), Article 20 and Caron (2006), *supra* note 64, pp. 467-475.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 192, citing Report of the UNCITRAL on the Work of its Ninth Session, UN GAOR, 31st Sess., Supp No. 17, UN Doc.

Indonesia,* the tribunal stated that Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules requires only that amendments as of right fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement and that considerations of \"the fair and efficient administration of arbitral justice\" favoured a liberal approach towards claim amendment and procedural rules that would guard against \"maximalist and confrontational positions.\" Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 196 citing *Himpurna California Energy Ltd and PT.

Mir's Ltd.* According to the Respondent, the case is irrelevant to the one at hand, given that it only concerned the narrow issue of whether a party is deemed to have waived a jurisdictional objection based on the invalidity of the arbitration agreement if it participates in the arbitration without raising this objection.106\n\nSecond Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 77:10-23.\n\n**B.** The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this issue is governed primarily by the provisions of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, which the Parties have agreed should govern the conduct of the arbitration.107 The Tribunal has also considered Swedish law, as the *lex arbitri,* and general principles of law pertaining to the good conduct of arbitral and adjudicative processes. All three adopt what might be described as an approach based upon \"common sense\" and fairness, rather than the application of technical or formalistic rules.\n\nArticle 8(2) BIT; Terms of Appointment, para. 4.1.\n\n114.\n\nArticle 21(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules states:\n\nA plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the statement of defence or, with respect to a counter-claim, in the reply to the counterclaim.\n\nUnlike the corresponding provision in the 2010 Rules (Article 23(2)), Article 21(3) of the 1976 Rules does not expressly confer upon a tribunal the power to allow a later plea.108 The Respondent maintains, however, that such a power is implicit, because Article 20 of the 1976 Rules permits a respondent to amend its defence, although the tribunal may disallow such amendment if it \"considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances.\" The Claimant denies that Article 20 is applicable to jurisdictional objections.\n\nArticle 23(2) of the 2010 Rules states that \"the arbitral tribunal may... admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified\".\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that what is now explicit in Article 23(2) of the 2010 Rules was implicit in the 1976 Rules. To preclude a respondent from making a jurisdictional objection after it submitted its statement of defence when that objection concerned facts which arose only after the date on which that statement was filed would involve a grave injustice. That injustice would be particularly grave where, as here, the new facts involve conduct on the part of the Claimant which the Claimant chose not to notify to the Respondent or the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that the leading commentary on the UNCITRAL Rules points out that the Conference which adopted the 1976 Rules considered that the inclusion of a provision in what became Article 21(3) of the 1976 Rules expressly permitting a tribunal to allow a late jurisdictional plea was unnecessary, because the provision on amendment in Article 20 and the broad general power of the tribunal \"to conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate\" were sufficient. The commentary concludes:\n\nThe last sentence of Article 23(2) [of the 2010 Rules] thus expressly states what was previously only implicit under the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules: that the arbitral tribunal has discretion in limited circumstances to admit justifiably late pleas, such as due to the discovery of new evidence.109\n\nCaron (2012), *supra* note 89, p. 456.\n\n116.\n\nIn consequence, the Tribunal finds that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules do not bar a party from raising a jurisdictional objection based upon facts which came into existence, or which it could have discovered by reasonable inquiry, only after the filing of a statement of defence.\n\n117.\n\nThat is manifestly the case here. The new jurisdictional objections are based upon the action of the Claimant in commencing proceedings in the Slovak courts. Its Petition for the Commencement of Proceedings was only lodged with the District Court on 22 November 2010. That was a little more than two weeks after the Respondent had filed its Statement of Defence in the arbitration and while the Tribunal was considering the request for bifurcation so as to create a separate jurisdiction phase. Moreover, the Petition was only served upon the Respondent on 13 May 2011, which was when the Respondent first became aware of its existence.\n\n118.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal does not consider that a respondent has an unlimited power to add new jurisdictional objections after the statement of defence has been filed. The Caron commentary quoted above makes plain that the Tribunal has discretion to admit \"justifiably late pleas\". That conclusion follows from the general principles of fairness and procedural economy, as well as from the fact that Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules allows an amendment \"unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances\". In deciding whether a plea is \"justifiably late\", the Tribunal must therefore have regard to whether there has been undue delay by the Respondent once it became aware of the facts and to whether there will be undue prejudice to the Claimant if the plea is admitted.110 The Tribunal notes that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Sweden in *Technoprotnexport v. Mir\u2019s Limited,* 14 June 2013, discussed by the Claimant's Swedish law expert, Professor Runeland, also requires that a jurisdictional objection must be raised without undue delay once the facts are - or could reasonably have been - known.\n\nIn the light of its findings below, the Tribunal need not expressly decide the point raised by the Respondent, disputed by the Claimant, that precluding the Respondent from raising its new jurisdictional objections would require a cumulative finding of \"undue delay\" and \"undue prejudice to the other party\" in spite of the text of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules providing that a tribunal may disallow an amendment to the statement of defence on the alternative bases of \"the delay in making it or prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances.\" In any event, the determination of whether the delay is \"undue\" may naturally take into account whether such delay has caused prejudice to the other side, and a tribunal may have regard to both factors in the more global determination of whether a late plea is \"justified\". For the same reasons, the Tribunal need not decide whether Article 20 establishes a presumption of \"amendability\" of defences or a presumption of waiver of jurisdictional objections made after the statement of defence, with the corresponding shift of the burden as to the demonstration of the (non)-justification of the late plea.\n\n119.\n\nIn the present case, the first new fact was the filing of the Petition in the District Court on 22 November 2010 but that fact did not become known to the Respondent until the Petition was served upon it by the Court on 13 May 2011. The Claimant is not, of course, to blame for the delay of almost six months between the filing of its Petition and the service by the District Court of that Petition. Nevertheless, the Claimant chose to inform neither the Respondent nor the Tribunal of its actions. At the time that it filed its Petition, it had just requested an extension of time in which to respond to the Respondent\u2019s request to the Tribunal for bifurcation of the proceedings.111 It agreed to bifurcation on 30 November 2010, eight days after it had filed its Petition. At that point, the Claimant knew what jurisdictional objections were then being raised by the Respondent and the schedule for pleading in respect of those objections. It chose, however, not to mention to either the Tribunal or the Respondent the fact that it had just commenced proceedings in the Slovak courts. The Claimant maintains that \"it saw no reason to inform the Tribunal\"112 of its action in commencing a case the purpose of which it describes as purely conservatory. The Tribunal will say more on this point later. For now, it is sufficient to say that, even accepting for the moment the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the proceedings as purely conservatory, the Claimant must have realized that there was a possibility that its action in the Slovak courts would be relied upon by the Respondent in support of its position that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction. Had the Claimant been frank about its conduct, the Respondent would have had the opportunity to amend its Statement of Defence, had it wanted to do so, very soon after that Statement was deposited. The schedule for the proceedings could have been amended so as to bring this new jurisdictional issue within the scope of the jurisdiction phase and the Claimant would have been able to point to its reference in the Petition to arbitration as the primary forum as a response to any objection taken by the Respondent. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent could not have been expected to inquire into whether any proceedings had been commenced in the Slovak courts.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s request for an extension of time was made by letter of 16 November 2010, six days before it filed its Petition with the District Court; First Award, para. 12.\n\nPara. 36, above.\n\n120.\n\nMoreover, by commencing proceedings in the Slovak courts, the Claimant was advancing a position in those courts (that the BIT was directly effective in the law of the Slovak Republic and enforceable in its courts) that was directly at odds with the argument it was advancing before the Tribunal (where it maintained that the BIT had no effect in Slovak law and denied the possibility of any remedy in the Slovak courts). Again, the Claimant had an explanation it could offer, namely that it had little hope of success in the Slovak courts.\"113 The Tribunal makes no comment on the merits of that explanation but it has no hesitation in saying that the Claimant should have admitted to what it was doing.\n\nAs its counsel explained at the Second Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), pp. 104:25 107:25.\n\n121.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent had no opportunity to raise the points made in the new jurisdictional objections at the time that it submitted its Statement of Defence or when the Tribunal ordered bifurcation and fixed a schedule of pleading for the jurisdiction phase. In deciding whether there was undue delay by the Respondent the Tribunal must, therefore, consider only the period between the service of the Petition on the Respondent on 13 May 2011 and the filing of the Supplementary Statement of Defence on 25 May 2012. The fact that just over a year elapsed between the two dates is inevitably a matter of concern when considering whether a delay was \"undue\".\n\n122.\n\nIn this context, it is necessary to distinguish between the two new jurisdictional objections. The first objection - that the Parties have agreed that the dispute will be decided otherwise than by arbitration - is dependent upon two facts:\n\n(a) the service upon the Respondent of the Claimant\u2019s petition (on 13 May 2011) and\n\n(b) the service upon the Claimant of the Respondent\u2019s Reply (on 18 April 2012)\n\nThe first event is said to constitute the making of the offer and the second the acceptance of that offer.114 Since it is not alleged that any agreement to resolve the dispute otherwise than by arbitration can have come into existence before the occurrence of the second event, the question is whether the Respondent was guilty of undue delay in not raising its objection until some five weeks after that event occurred.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), pp. 21:1-12, 90:8-9, 196:15-23.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this cannot be regarded as an undue delay. At that time the arbitral proceedings were quiet, in the sense that the Parties were awaiting the decision of the Tribunal on the original jurisdictional objections. There was thus no particular urgency and the situation was markedly different from that which existed in November 2010, when the Claimant knew that the Tribunal was in the process of fixing a schedule for dealing with the issue of jurisdiction, yet chose not to disclose that it had commenced proceedings in the Slovak courts. Nor does the Tribunal consider that there was any prejudice to the Claimant as a result of the fact that the Respondent waited until 25 May 2012, rather than filing its Supplementary Statement of Defence in late April or early May.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Claimant\u2019s argument that, even though the act which the Respondent alleges was the acceptance of the Claimant\u2019s offer to settle the dispute otherwise than through arbitration had not yet taken place, the Respondent must have known what position it would take in the Slovak proceedings before the jurisdictional hearing in December 2011. It has also noted the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Respondent obtained extensions of time in the Slovak proceedings on the basis of representations that it had to engage in a tendering process before appointing counsel but actually (according to the Claimant) engaged in no such process.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider these arguments persuasive. Whatever criticism may be made of the time that it took the Respondent to make up its mind what to do about the proceedings in the Slovak courts, the fact is that the argument that there was an agreement depends upon an acceptance of the offer said to have been made by the Claimant and nothing which could be interpreted as such an acceptance occurred before the Claimant received the Respondent's Reply in the Slovak proceedings on 18 April 2012. The Claimant accepts that, if there was a contract between the Parties, it was concluded on 18 April 2O12.115 There cannot be undue delay in raising an objection if the facts which are the essential basis for that objection had not yet taken place. Nor does the allegation that the Respondent misled the Slovak court (and the Tribunal expresses no view as to whether that was in fact the case) affect the position before the Tribunal.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant, Dr Bohrn, told the Tribunal that \"the contract, if there was one, was made on 18th April\", Second Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 136:21-22.\n\n126.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that there is no basis for refusing to admit the first new jurisdictional objection on the basis of prejudice to the Claimant. If the Claimant has been prejudiced by the fact that this objection was not raised ahead of the 2011 jurisdictional hearing, that is largely its own fault. Had it acted with greater candour in November 2010 and informed the Tribunal of the action it had taken in the Slovak courts, the significance of that action for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal could have been considered at the 2011 hearing.\n\n127.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s submission that the first new jurisdictional objection was raised too late and decides to admit that objection.\n\n128.\n\nThe position with regard to the second new jurisdictional objection, which is based not on an alleged agreement between the Parties but upon an allegation of waiver by unilateral act of the Claimant, is more complicated. As has already been explained, that objection is put in two different ways. The first is that the act of filing the Petition to commence proceedings in the District Court was, in and of itself, sufficient to constitute a waiver of the right to arbitrate. The second is that the alleged waiver came about as a result of the whole course of conduct of the Claimant, including its subsequent actions in the Slovak proceedings.\n\n129.\n\nWith regard to the first aspect of the waiver objection, the Tribunal considers that there has been a clear case of undue delay. The Respondent was aware of the Petition commencing the Slovak proceedings in May 2011. If it thought that the Claimant\u2019s action in filing that Petition amounted to a waiver of the right to arbitrate, it could and should have taken action within no more than a few weeks (a period more than sufficient for its experienced counsel to have realized the significance of the action). Instead, it not only stayed its hand, it stated to the Tribunal, at the opening of the jurisdictional hearing on 19 December 201 1 (more than six months after it became aware of the Petition) that no basis for objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction had yet arisen:\n\nwe alluded in our pre-hearing conference call with you to the possibility that facts would emerge which would give rise to a possible objection to jurisdiction. All we can say right now is that those facts have not yet emerged and so we really have nothing more to say on that issue at this point. If they do and when they do, we will promptly inform the Tribunal and of course the Claimant.116\n\nFirst Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (19 December 2011), pp. 4-5.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that the waiver objection, in its first manifestation, has been raised out of time.\n\n131.\n\nThat, however, does not conclude the matter. The Respondent's second way of framing its waiver objection depends not just upon the Petition but upon the subsequent conduct of the Claimant, in particular the following events:\n\n- the Claimant\u2019s opposition to the Respondent's request for an extension of time in the District Court (3 August 2011; para. 45, above);\n\n- the Claimant's response to the Respondent\u2019s defence in the District Court (16 July 2012; para. 64, above);\n\n- the Claimant\u2019s response to the District Court\u2019s enquiry regarding its motion for suspension of the proceedings (16 November 2012; para. 70, above);\n\n- the Claimant\u2019s request for disclosure of the *Achmea* award (14 January 2013; para. 73, above);\n\n- the Claimant\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the District Court (31 January 2013; para. 75, above); and\n\n- the Claimant\u2019s response to the Respondent\u2019s appeal against that judgment (3 April 2013; para. 81, above).\n\n132.\n\nAll of these events occurred long after the Respondent became aware of the Petition in May 2011. To the extent that the waiver objection is based upon the cumulative effect of these acts, it cannot be considered to have been made too late.\n\n133.\n\nIndeed, if there is a question about timing, it is that all but one of the events mentioned in the preceding paragraph occurred after the filing of the Supplementary Statement of Defence and all but two after the issue of the First Award. Although the point was not raised by the Claimant, it could therefore be argued that the Tribunal should not take them into account since, if the Tribunal had addressed the points raised in the Supplementary Statement of Defence at once and then decided on them in the First Award, the last four of these events on which the Respondent now relies would not have taken place when the Tribunal decided the matter. The Tribunal considers, however, that an objection of waiver by conduct has to be considered on the facts as they stand at the date that the decision is taken, not at the date the objection is filed or at the earliest date when a decision could have been taken. The Tribunal does not consider that a respondent must further amend its defence for every new fact which arises in order for these to be taken into account when deciding upon the objection.\n\n134.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s argument regarding undue delay with regard to the waiver objection in so far as that objection is based upon the Petition alone but rejects it in so far as the objection concerns waiver by a course of conduct.\n\n**III. WHETHER THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED UNDER ARTICLE 8(2) OF THE BIT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO THE SLOVAK COURTS INSTEAD OF ARBITRATION**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** The Positions of the Parties\n-----------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, according to the phrase \"unless otherwise agreed\" in Article 8(2) of the BIT. the availability of international arbitration is foreclosed once the Parties agree on an alternative mechanism for settling their dispute.117 Article 8(2) thus operates to prevent \"multiple proceedings in multiple fora in relation to the same investment dispute.\"118\n\nRespondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence, paras. 9-12, citing BIT, Art. 8(2), Exhibits RL-40A, RL-40B\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 11.\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"unless otherwise agreed\" - in the original Czech and German as well as in English - refers to agreement that the dispute be resolved in a forum other than treaty arbitration, including litigation in domestic courts.119 Moreover, the ordinary meaning of Article 8(2) does not impose any particular requirements or formalities for such agreement: the Parties may agree on court jurisdiction tacitly or through their conduct alone.120\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 44-48, citing *Webster's Unabridged Dictionary* (2\"\u20181 edition, 1997), pp. 40, 1372, 2080 (Exhibit RL-493) and P. Peters, *The Cambridge Guide to English Usage* (2004), p. 558 (Exhibit RL-476)\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 49, citing Expert Opinion of Jan Klucka on Selected Legal Questions Arising in the Dispute, 22 May 2013 (\"Klucka Opinion\"), paras. 43-44.\n\n137.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this is consistent with international law and practice, as demonstrated by the principle of *forum prorogatum* and the *Corfu Channel* case, where the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") stated that \"[w]hile the consent of the parties confers jurisdiction on the Court, neither the Statute nor the Rules require that this consent should be expressed in any particular form.\"121 The Respondent further alleges that the notion that agreements can be arrived at implicitly (or via documents, oral statements, or conduct) forms a general principle of law,122 as evinced by Articles 1.2, 2.11, and 3.12 of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (\"UNIDROIT Principles\").123 In particular, the Respondent highlights the *Haya de la Torre Case,* in which the ICJ found that the parties had consented to its jurisdiction because neither had objected to a decision on the merits.124\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 50-57, citing *Corfu Channel (United Kingdom* v. *Albania),* Preliminary Objection, Judgment (25 Mar. 1948), I.C.J.

Paulsson, \"Arbitration without Privity\", 10 (2) ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 232 (Fall 1995) (Exhibit RL-47I) and C. Schreuer, *el al..

This principle is codified, for example, in the Brussels I Regulation,127 which is in force in the European Union generally and is therefore fully integrated in the legal systems of the Slovak Republic, Austria, and Sweden,128 as well as the Bustamante Code of Private International Law of 1928, which recognize tacit submission when a plaintiff files a lawsuit and the defendant makes an appearance without contesting the court\u2019s jurisdiction.129\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 63-65; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 67 citing Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, OJ L 12/1, 16.1.2001, Preamble, para. 6 (Exhibit RL-455).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 66, citing Bustamante Code of Private International Law of 1928, Articles 318322, pp. 48-49 (Exhibit RL-447).\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that any agreement by the Parties that their dispute would be decided by means other than treaty arbitration automatically supersedes the provision for treaty arbitration in Article 8(2) of the BIT.130 The Respondent submits that most private international law systems, as well as Article 3(b) of the 2005 Hague Convention and Article 23 of the Brussels 1 Regulation, presume that an agreement between the Parties designating a dispute resolution forum excludes other dispute resolution fora.131 The Respondent also notes that classic contract law theory mandates that \"in the case of successive agreements on the same matter, the new agreement supersedes the previous agreement\" - which principle is also codified in Article 30(3) of the VCLT and applies to jurisdictional agreements.132\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 103; Second Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), pp. 45:20-47:9, 146:17-150:9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 105-109, citing Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements, Article 3(b) (Exhibit RL-455); Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, OJ L 12/1, 16.1.2001, Article 23 (Exhibit RL-455); U.

It is uncontested that there is an identity of Parties in the arbitration and the court case.139 Both the Statement of Claim in the arbitration and the Petition in the Slovak court proceedings are premised on legislative amendments to the Health Insurance Company Act of 2004, which allegedly breached the Treaty, and this too is uncontested.140 Finally, the causes of action listed in the Notice of Arbitration are duplicated in the Petition,141 and the relief sought is the same for both proceedings.142\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 13; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 77.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 16, comparing the Statement of Claim, para. 22, the Notice of Arbitration, p. 5 and the Petition, paras. 6, 9; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 77.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 14, citing the Notice of Arbitration, para. 35 and the Petition, paras. 76, 82-83.\n\nRespondent's Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 15, citing the Notice of Arbitration, para. 46 and the Petition, para. 122.\n\n145.\n\nAs regards the last point, the Respondent points out that both the Statement of Claim and the Petition involve allegations of breach of Articles 2, 4, and 5 of the BIT,143 which are directly applicable within the Slovak legal order through the joint operation of Article 154c(2) of the Slovak Constitution - under which qualified international treaties are incorporated into domestic law \"if so provided by a law\" - and Section 756 of the Slovak Commercial Code - which states that the Slovak Commercial Code shall apply \"only if an international treaty which is binding on the Slovak Republic and was published in the Collection of Acts does not contain any different regulation.\"144 The Respondent further highlights that the Claimant maintained - and still maintains - its Article 5 claim before the Bratislava Court even after the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction over this claim in its First Jurisdictional Award.145\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 78, citing Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim in accordance with Article 18 UNCITRAL Rules, 23 November 2009, para. 46 and EURAM\u2019s Petition for the commencement of proceedings for the payment of EUR 131,400,000 with accessions, dated 22 November 2010, paras. 13, 30-37, 76, 82-83 (Exhibit RL-344).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 99-100, citing Klucka Opinion, para. 24; Constitution of the Slovak Republic, Article l54c(2) (Exhibit CL-46); excerpt from the Act.

The Respondent first points out that the Petition belies the Claimant\u2019s argument that its BIT claims were made in the alternative to Slovak and European law causes of action when it says at paragraph 76 of its Petition that \"[b]esides the above-stated grounds we believe that the Slovak Republic has breached the Investment Protection Treaty, in particular its Articles 2, 4, and 5.\"146 The Respondent also highlights the Claimant's 16 July 2012 submission to the Bratislava Court in response to the Reply of the Slovak Republic, where the Claimant allegedly clarified that it was claiming damages for the breach of BIT obligations and sought relief on the merits of its Treaty claims.147\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 80, citing Petition, paras. 45, 76, 82-83.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 81, citing EURAM's Statement to Respondent's Statement delivered to the Court on the 1st day of March 2012, dated 16 July 2012, pp. 1-3, 10 (Exhibit R-23).\n\n147.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent dismisses the Claimant's allegation that its causes of action in the arbitration are not duplicated in the Petition. In particular, the Respondent notes that the Claimant has still not withdrawn its Article 5 claim from the Slovak court proceedings.148 It emphasizes that, on 14 January 2013, the same day that the Claimant asked the Tribunal to continue the arbitration with regard to its Article 5 claim, the Claimant submitted a motion to the Bratislava Court to have the Respondent produce a copy of the award in the *Achmea B.V. v. The Slovak Republic* arbitration.149 The Respondent argues that, given that the tribunal in *Achmea B V.* v. *The Slovak Republic* upheld the claimant\u2019s claim for breach of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT'S equivalent to Article 5 in a dispute that shares the same factual background, this motion must be presumed to be made in support of the Article 5 claim in the Slovak court proceedings.150\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 82-83, citing Petition, para. 83 and Klucka Opinion, para. 7.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 84, citing EURAM\u2019s Motion for Evidence and Disclosure of Information, 14 January 2013 (Exhibit R-26).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 84, citing *Achmea B.E. (formerly known as \"Eureko BV\")* v. *The Slovak Republic.* PCA Case No. 2008-13, Final Award (7 December 2012) (Lowe, van den Berg, Veeder), paras. 286-295 (Exhibit RL-446).\n\n148.\n\nThirdly, the Respondent stresses that the claims in the court proceedings are not only based on the same BIT causes of action, but also seek exactly the same relief: EUR 131,400,000 plus interest claimed from this Tribunal and EUR 131,400,000 with accessions that is claimed from the Bratislava Court.151\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 85-86, citing Statement of Claim, para. 46 and Petition, paras. 11-12.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent addresses the Claimant\u2019s objections to this argument in turn. First, and in response to the Claimant\u2019s contention that the Petition clearly prioritizes arbitration as the forum for the resolution of its claims, the Respondent highlights the failure of the Claimant to condition its Petition on the Tribunal\u2019s decision on its own jurisdiction, which was then forthcoming.152 Moreover, the Claimant not only actively pursued its claims before the Bratislava Court153 but also failed to withdraw its Article 5 claim when the Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction over it.154 The Respondent also points out that the Claimant\u2019s second motion to suspend the court proceedings in favour of arbitration was made in the alternative and was conditioned on the result of its first motion.155\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 92; Second Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 34:7-24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 92, citing Claimant\u2019s Statement to Respondent\u2019s Statement delivered to the Court on the 1st day of March 2012, dated 16 July 2012, p. 10 (Exhibit R-23) and EURAM\u2019s Statement to the Further Evidence Produced by Respondent, dated 8 August 2012, p. 3 (Exhibit R-24)\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 92, citing Klucka Opinion, paras. 11-14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 93, citing Petition, para. 120.\n\n150.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent labels as \"absurd\" the argument of the Claimant that its offer to the Respondent could only produce a jurisdictional agreement that was premised on the primacy of arbitration.156 The Respondent stresses that its jurisdictional objections in this arbitration - both its prior ones and its present one - belie its acceptance of such an \"offer\" in favour of arbitration.157 The Respondent highlights, moreover, that it is not contesting, and has not contested, the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court *ratione materiae* or *ratione personae.158* It clarifies that the objection to the designation of the National Council as defendant in the Bratislava Court proceedings does not qualify as an objection to the jurisdiction, but rather a procedural question.159 According to the Respondent, the fact that the National Council has requested that the compatibility of the BIT with EU law be referred to the CJEU and that it has submitted other procedural motions in the Slovak court proceedings presupposes the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court.160 As regards this point, the Respondent further clarifies that its reference to this argument as a jurisdictional objection in its 2 April 2012 letter to the Tribunal and at one point in its Supplementary Statement of Defense were \"misstatements\".161\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 94.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 94, citing Expert Legal Opinion of Professor Lars Heuman, 23 May 2013, para. 38 (\"Heuman Opinion\").\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 94-95.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 97, citing Klucka Opinion, para. 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 96, citing Klu\u00e8ka Opinion, para. 21; Second Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), pp. 157:19-158:9.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), pp. 43:19-45:12, 153:21- 154:2.\n\n***2. The Claimant***\n---------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimant first clarifies that it does not dispute that Article 8(2) of the BIT allows the Parties tacitly to \"agree otherwise\" on a dispute resolution mechanism other than arbitration.162 Nevertheless, the Claimant emphasizes that Slovak law - and not just Article 8(2) of the BIT - applies to this issue, and that Section 37(e)(3) of the Slovak Act of International Private Law, which governs agreements on jurisdiction, requires jurisdictional agreements to be in writing.163 The Claimant also disputes the applicability of the Brussels 1 Regulation to this arbitration on the ground that the scope of Brussels I allegedly expressly excludes arbitration, and, moreover, Brussels I applies only in civil and commercial matters.164\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 160.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 161.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 162, citing Article l(I)(2)(d) of Exhibit RL-455.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimant further clarifies that the jurisdiction of the Slovak courts derives exclusively from the Slovak Code of Civil Procedure, that jurisdiction must be determined by those courts at any stage of the proceedings, and that the Slovak courts' jurisdiction cannot be enlarged by agreement of the Parties.165 As such, \"[i]f the court has no jurisdiction. Respondent\u2019s \u2018acceptance\u2019 is irrelevant.\"166\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 52-54, citing Section 103 of the Slovak Civil Procedure Code (Exhibit CL-206/1); Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 166-167.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 52.\n\n153.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant maintains that the Parties did not agree, in writing or otherwise, to any dispute resolution method other than international arbitration or to confer jurisdiction on the Bratislava Court.167 The Claimant highlights that both Parties have challenged the jurisdiction of the Court168 and that the Claimant had asked the Court to suspend the court proceedings pursuant to Article 106(3) of the Slovak Code of Civil Procedure in view of its prior initiation of the arbitration.169 The Claimant also points out that the Petition expressly states that it considers arbitration to be the primary forum for resolving its dispute.170\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 42; Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para 160.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 55.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 56, citing Section 106(3) of the Slovak Civil Procedure Code (Exhibit CL-206/1).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 57.\n\n154.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Claimant asserts that its Petition cannot be considered an offer to agree to litigate rather than arbitrate its Treaty claims. Under Swedish law -applicable to these proceedings as *lex arbitri -* the intention of the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract is the starting point of contractual interpretation.171 Absent other factors, the written agreement serves as a key indicator of this intention.172\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 58.\n\nClaimant\u2018s Reply, para. 58, citing Runeland Opinion, CL-207.\n\n155.\n\nSimilarly, under general principles, contractual interpretation under the UNIDROIT Principles is based on the common intention of the parties, or if such common intention cannot be established, on the \"meaning that reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties would give to it in the same circumstances\" (Article 4.1).173 Unilateral statements or conduct must also be interpreted \"according to that Party\u2019s intention if the other party knew or could not have been unaware of that intention,\" or if that intention cannot be established, according to the \"meaning that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would give to it in the same circumstances.\"174\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 59.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 60.\n\n156.\n\nThe Claimant explains that under Swedish law, an agreement arises upon a \"meeting of the minds\" or when an offeree accepts the offer of an offeror.175 The law defines neither \"offer\" nor \"acceptance.\"176 In contrast, Article 2.1.2 of the UNIDROIT Principles defines an offer as a \"proposal for concluding a contract... [that] is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance.\"177\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 45-46.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 48.\n\n157.\n\nApplying Swedish law to the present case, the Claimant argues that the Petition plainly discloses its intention to pursue the arbitration of its claims and explains that the Claimant filed the Petition out of necessity (in order to prevent the potential prescription of its claims).178 If the Claimant made any offer in its Petition which the Respondent thereafter accepted, then this offer necessarily includes the designation of arbitration as the primary forum for the resolution of its claims.179\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 61.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 62, citing Runeland Opinion, para. 34 (Exhibit CL-207).\n\n158.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the application of Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the UNIDROIT Principles leads to the same result. The Petition makes clear that the Claimant intended to pursue the arbitration of its claims and only filed the Petition to prevent its claims from becoming time-barred.180 A contrary interpretation would be unreasonable.181\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 63\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 63\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant argues moreover that the Petition cannot constitute an offer by the Claimant to litigate its claims in the Bratislava Court or to submit to the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court, nor can the Reply constitute acceptance, because both contest the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court.182 According to the Claimant, it objected by stating in its Petition that arbitration was the primary forum for its claims and the Respondent objected by arguing the invalidity of the BIT and requesting a referral of the matter to the CJEU.'183\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 66.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 64-66; Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 163-164, 180, citing p. 3, para. I (Exhibit CL-204).\n\n160.\n\nHowever, even if the Respondent\u2019s motion to refer the matter to the CJEU technically constitutes an acknowledgment of the Bratislava Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the claim, the Claimant argues that the Respondent is actively trying to prevent the claims of the Claimant from being heard on the merits, since it is still attempting to get to a CJEU ruling which would void the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court.184 According to the Claimant, given such a *de facto* denial of the Bratislava Court\u2019s jurisdiction and the Petition\u2019s statements as to the arbitration being the primary forum for the Claimant\u2019s claims, no reasonable person would construe this as an acceptance that the Bratislava Court should decide Claimant's case.185\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 166, citing Br\u00f4stl Opinion, para. 30; Second Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), pp 193:16-196:9.\n\nClaimant\u2018s Rebuttal, paras. 166-168, citing Br\u00f4stl Opinion, paras. 28, 30.\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimant further highlights the difference between the causes of action and the relief sought in the arbitration and the court proceedings.186 The Claimant first points out that its primary cause of action in the Bratislava Court proceedings is a *sui generis* claim based on Slovak constitutional law that is not arbitrable.187 As this claim is distinct from that brought by the Claimant in the arbitration188 - and indeed, tribunals in numerous cases have found this distinction significant189 - the operation of the alleged fork in the road clause is precluded.190 [REDACTED]191\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 75.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 76, 80; Claimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 82, citing Br\u00f4stl Opinion, para. 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 80\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 83, referring to *Occidental* v. *Ecuador, supra* note 148, paras. 57-58 (where the tribunal allegedly distinguished between treaty-based issues that had come to arbitration and non-contractual domestic law questions) [Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 83, fn. 50]; *CMS Gas Transmission Company* v. *the Argentine Republic* (Exhibit RL-442), paras. 78-80 (in which the tribunal allegedly distinguished between claims concerning contractual rights under a licence and treaty claims) [Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 83, fn. 51]; *Alex Genin* v. *the Republic of Estonia* (Exhibit RL-15), para. 332 (where the tribunal allegedly distinguished between the investment dispute itself and the revocation of a banking license dispute that could only be resolved in domestic courts) [Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 83, fn. 52]; *Pan American Energy LLC and PP Argentina Exploration Company v. the Argentine Republic* (Exhibit RL-445), para. 157 (where the tribunal allegedly found that a local claim was not based on a BIT violation even if the BIT was mentioned in passing) [Claimant's Reply, para. 83, fn. 53]; and *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets LP* v. *Argentine Republic* (Exhibit RL-154) (where the tribunal allegedly distinguished between the claims made in local courts and those made in the arbitration) [Claimant's Reply, para. 83, fn. 54],\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 82. citing Christoph Schreuer, \"Travelling the BIT Route - Of Waiting Periods, Umbrella Clauses and Forks in the Road\", Journal of World Investment and Trade, April 2004, Vol. 5, No. 2, p. 248 (Exhibit CL-209-1).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 77 citing the Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Petition, para. 8.1.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimant also asserts that the BIT may not enjoy direct effect in the Slovak legal system, arguing that \"(i) the BIT lacks direct effect and that (ii) even if it did have direct effect, Slovak courts of general jurisdiction lacked jurisdiction and (iii) even if the courts had jurisdiction, no remedy was available for an investor.\"192 The Claimant argues that the analyses of the Respondent\u2019s two experts on Slovak law \u2014 in addition to contradicting one other - are erroneously premised on the idea that the Claimant\u2019s treaty claims are civil and commercial in nature or that parties to Slovak court litigation can by agreement create causes of action and confer jurisdiction on the court in contravention of the applicable procedural rules on subject matter jurisdiction.193\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 78-79; Claimant's Rebuttal, paras. 169-172, both citing Claimant\u2019s CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 337-353.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 173-182, citing p. 52 (with reference to the CJEU judgments in *LTU v.

First, the Treaty does not contain a fork in the road clause.194 Secondly, according to scholars and cases cited by the Claimant, a fork in the road clause forecloses the option of international arbitration in favour of domestic courts only when the domestic proceedings were instituted before the arbitration, which is not the case here.195 Thirdly, the Claimant argues that tribunals do not \"assume lightly\" that a claimant has chosen the domestic court system over international arbitration.196 and cites *Occidental* for the proposition that only a choice that is entirely free and not under any form of duress can trigger the operation of the fork in the road clause.197\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 74.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 80-81, citing Christoph Schreuer, \"Travelling the BIT Route - Of Waiting Periods, Umbrella Clauses and Forks in the Road\u2019\u2019, Journal of World Investment and Trade, April 2004, Vol. 5, No. 2, p. 248 (Exhibit CL-209-1).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 82-84, citing *Pan American Energy LLC and PP Argentina Exploration Company* v. *Argentine Republic* (Exhibit RL-445), para. 155.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 85, citing *Occidental v. Ecuador, supra* note 148, paras. 60-61.\n\n164.\n\nIn that case, the tribunal found that the claimant had brought its claim to the courts under duress because the law required a taxpayer to protest a resolution in court in order to prevent that resolution from becoming final and binding.198 Likening its case to that in *Occidental,* the Claimant alleges that it was forced to file the Petition in order to halt the limitation period and protect its rights in case the Tribunal dismissed its claims for lack of jurisdiction.199\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 85.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 67-72, 86, citing Section 101 of the Slovak Civil Code (Exhibit CL-208).\n\n**B.** The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal must begin by considering what is the applicable law. The Parties both made submissions about the interpretation of Article 8(2) of the BIT, but they also submitted expert evidence on both Swedish and Slovak law. The Tribunal considers that the first jurisdictional objection depends upon the construction of the phrase \"otherwise agreed\" in Article 8(2) of the BIT. That issue must be decided in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation under international law. Slovak law is also relevant, however, in that an analysis of the steps taken by the Parties in the Slovak proceedings can be made only in the light of that law. In addition, Slovak law is applicable to the extent that the objection is subsidiarily cast as the conclusion of a choice of forum agreement submitting the dispute to the Slovak courts which supersedes and implicitly terminates the prior arbitration agreement arising under the BIT. As argued by the Respondent, such agreements are presumptively governed by the law of the State to whose courts the dispute is submitted, unless another law is specifically chosen by the parties. Finally, the exact effect of any tacit agreement on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction may also fall to be determined in accordance with Swedish law-as the *lex arbitri* in these proceedings by virtue of the Tribunal\u2019s designation of Stockholm as the legal place (seat) of the arbitration.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s view is that the objection is best characterized as an application of the phrase \"otherwise agreed\" under Article 8(2), which corresponds to the way in which it was first raised by the Respondent in its Supplementary Statement of Defence. Nevertheless, in view of the submissions made by the Parties and the very full and helpful reports of their experts, the Tribunal has also considered whether there was an agreement to decide the dispute otherwise than by arbitration as a matter of Swedish law or Slovak law.\n\n167.\n\nAccordingly, the next step is to determine what the phrase \"otherwise agreed\" in Article 8(2) means. The Tribunal has no doubt that it means what it says. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over a dispute falling within Article 8(2) (in the present case, the dispute under Article 5) unless the Parties have concluded an agreement to settle that dispute by other means. In international law, an agreement need not be contained in a single document - treaties, for example, are frequently concluded by an exchange of notes between two parties - nor is any particular form required. However, the concept of an \"agreement\" requires that the parties do actually agree, in other words that there is a meeting of minds. The natural meaning of the phrase \"otherwise agreed\" in a treaty is thus that there should be an agreement in the sense of a meeting of minds between the parties. There is nothing in the text of the BIT - and the Tribunal has been shown nothing which might fall within the other aids to interpretation recognized by international law - that would point to a different interpretation.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent argued, in its Rejoinder and again at the hearing, that \"a strict offer and acceptance analysis\" was not required. It pointed to a number of judgments of the International Court of Justice regarding the establishment of jurisdiction by means of *forum prorogatum.* It also referred extensively to the case law on fork in the road clauses in other BITs. In so far as these arguments were advanced in support of a theory that an agreement could be found without a meeting of minds manifested in an offer and an acceptance, the Tribunal does not find them persuasive. The establishment of jurisdiction by means of *forum prorogatum* is still based upon the acceptance by a respondent of jurisdiction over the claim brought by an applicant and thus requires an analysis of the terms of that claim and any caveats which might be included therein. The fork in the road cases, though interesting, are of only indirect relevance. There is no fork in the road clause in the present BIT. Moreover, fork in the road clauses deal with unilateral acts and do not require an agreement between the parties for their operation, while the question here is whether or not the Parties have reached an agreement to proceed otherwise than by arbitration.\n\n169.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal considers that, as a matter of interpretation of Article 8(2) of the BIT, what is required is an agreement, in the sense of a meeting of minds. No formalities are required and the agreement may be derived from more than one document. But there must be an analysis of the offer (in this case the Petition) and the supposed acceptance (in this case the Reply of the Respondent in the Slovak proceedings) in order to determine whether the Parties agreed to proceed otherwise than by arbitration.\n\n170.\n\nThe position under Swedish law appears to be the same. Thus, Professor Runeland, the expert relied upon by the Claimant, states in his first opinion that \"under Swedish law, an agreement to amend or suspend or terminate an agreement to arbitrate is made in the same way as any other agreement\".200 He goes on to state that there are no requirements as to form. The Respondent\u2019s expert, Professor Heuman does not disagree.\n\nRuneland First Opinion, para. 33.\n\n171.\n\nAs to Slovak law, the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr Klucka, considers that there are no formal requirements for making an agreement. For him, the test is whether the \"acts or conduct of the parties... confirm without doubt their communal will (basis) to choose judicial \u2018forum\u2019 different from arbitration\" and this consent \"should be manifested with sufficient certainty and indisputability preventing any doubt of the real intention of parties\".201 Professor Br\u00f4stl, the expert on Slovak law relied upon by the Claimant, differs from this view only in that he maintains that there is a greater degree of formality required and that tacit agreements are not recognized. For the reasons stated below, the Tribunal considers that it does not have to resolve this one difference regarding Slovak law on the formation of a jurisdictional agreement.\n\nKlucka Opinion, para. 45.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal will, therefore, analyse the precise nature of the two critical steps taken by the Parties in the Slovak proceedings, namely the Petition filed by the Claimant on 22 November 2010 and served on the Respondent on 11 May 2011 and the Reply filed by the Respondent on 29 February 2012 and received by the Claimant on 18 April 2012.\n\n173.\n\nThe principal features of the Petition are described in paras. 32-35 above. In the present proceedings, the Claimant has sought to minimize the relationship between the proceedings which it commenced in the Slovak courts and its claim in the arbitration. Thus, in its Reply of 28 March 2013 in the arbitration proceedings, it said:\n\nClaimant\u2019s primary cause of action in the Petition is based on the Slovak Constitution, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights (\u2018\u2018ECHR\", a convention that is directly applicable in Slovakia pursuant to Article 154c (I) of the Slovak Constitution) and on the Additional Protocol to the Convention (\"Additional Protocol\"). Claimant devotes 44 paragraphs of its Petition to its primary cause of action based on Slovak law and 28 paragraphs to its alternative treaty based cause of action. Even this alternative cause of action does not duplicate Claimants claims in the arbitration. It neither includes the FET [fair and equitable treatment] claim nor the claim for a breach of Article 5 of the Treaty over which the Tribunal has found it has jurisdiction.202\n\nThe Claimant later added:\n\nMoreover, to the extent Claimant\u2019s claim in the Slovak proceedings is alternatively based on the Treaty, it is formulated as an expropriation claim. It is neither formulated as an FET claim nor is it formulated as a claim for breach of Article 5 of the Treaty, a claim over which the Tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction.203\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 77.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this analysis of the Petition. While the Petition undoubtedly raises claims under the Slovak Constitution and the ECHR, it states at the outset (before it considers the claim under the Constitution or the ECHR) that:\n\n... the Slovak Republic breached its obligations under *the relevant provisions* of the Treaty between the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic and the Republic of Austria concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 15 October 1990... *which are outlined below in this Petition for Commencement of Proceedings.* (Emphasis added.)204\n\nTwo paragraphs later, the Petition stated that the Claimant had instituted the present arbitration proceedings \"using *identical legal reasoning as in this Petition\"* (emphasis added).205 Later, the Petition stated that \"the Slovak Republic has breached the Investment Protection Treaty, in particular its Articles 2, 4 and 5\".206\n\nPetition, para. 11.\n\nPetition, para. 13.\n\nPetition, para. 76.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal has had difficulty in reconciling the different statements which the Claimant has made regarding Article 5 of the BIT. As shown above, Article 5 is expressly mentioned in the Petition as one of the provisions of the BIT which the Slovak Republic has breached. Yet in its Reply in the present phase of the arbitration proceedings, the Claimant twice denies that it has brought *a* claim under Article 5 in the Slovak courts. However, its expert witness on Slovak law, Dr Br\u00f4stl, stated that \"Article 5 is by no means determinative and is explicitly only of tertiary relevance\"207 and then stated:\n\n... EURAM within the support of its claim otherwise also relies upon the wording of the respective BIT Article 5, but it only subsidiarily argues by its violation, not directly requesting any compensation for it.208\n\nAt the hearing in September 2013, counsel for the Claimant responded in rather colourful terms to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant was \"trying to have its cake and eat it!\" Counsel for the Claimant showed the Tribunal a slide of what he described as the relevant slice of cake after the First Award, i.e. the Article 5 claim, being covered by a protective action in the Slovak court. He explained the position in the following terms:\n\nBefore the [first] jurisdictional award, the cake was whole. After the jurisdictional award, what the Tribunal had left of it was a slice, the Article 5 slice.\n\nNow, what happens to the slice? First of all, it lies in the hands of the Tribunal, but that slice may run a risk of being destroyed pending the decision. In the meantime, Claimant had to set up a protective bell jar in the form of the Bratislava proceedings under which it can bring the slice, if the Tribunal grants the jurisdictional objections.209\n\nThe Tribunal reads this passage as an acknowledgment that the Claimant did bring an Article 5 claim in the Slovak proceedings.\n\nBr\u00f4stl Opinion, para 13.\n\nBr\u00f4stl Opinion, para 26.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 116:11-21.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, in its Petition, the Claimant is claiming for breaches of the same provisions of the BIT, including Article 5, on which it relied in its Statement of Claim in the arbitration. Moreover, it is claiming exactly the same amount, 131,400,000 euros, in both sets of proceedings.\n\n177.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n178.\n\n[REDACTED] The question whether it will succeed -either on jurisdiction or on the merits - before the Slovak courts is not a matter which the Tribunal can or need decide. The only point which is relevant for the Tribunal is that the Claimant has commenced proceedings before the Slovak courts in respect of a claim for violations of the BIT, including Article 5. Although it has described this claim as \"hypothetical\u2019' and \"theoretical,\"211 it accepts that its position before the Slovak courts is that those courts have jurisdiction to find in its favour on the merits.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 105.\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts, however, that the Petition was filed in order to protect the Claimant against being time-barred in the event that the Tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction with regard to its claim in the arbitration proceedings. That is explicitly stated in paragraph 15 of the Petition (which is quoted in full at paragraph 33, above), in which the Claimant, having informed the Court about the existence of the arbitration proceedings and the jurisdictional challenge therein, stated that \"the Claimant believes that the primary forum for its claims to be raised and decided on is the arbitration\". The Petition also includes a request that the Court suspend the proceedings pending the decision of the Tribunal (see paragraph 35, above).\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s fears about being time-barred are exaggerated and even the Claimant\u2019s expert, Professor Br\u00f4stl, considered that the Claimant had taken the \"strictest interpretation\" of the Slovak law relating to time limits. The Tribunal considers, however, that this is precisely what any prudent claimant would do, and what this Claimant was entitled to do.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent also argues (and both experts on Slovak law accept) that it is not possible to bring a conditional claim in *a* Slovak court. The Tribunal accepts that this is the case but the critical question, for the purposes of the jurisdictional objection in the present proceedings, is whether the Claimant made clear that it wanted the dispute settled otherwise than in the arbitration. It is the nature of the offer to agree, not the precise position in Slovak law, which determines whether or not the Petition could give rise to an agreement that the dispute be settled otherwise than by arbitration. In view of the statements made in the Petition about the \"primary forum\" and the request for a suspension of proceedings, the Tribunal can only conclude that the Claimant\u2019s Petition did not amount to an offer to settle the dispute otherwise than by arbitration.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal then turns to the Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Petition. That Reply contended, inter alia, that the BIT is invalid, because it conflicts with EU law. That position is entirely consistent with the position adopted by the Respondent before the Tribunal and considered in the First Award. The Respondent maintained that the District Court is not empowered to rule on whether the BIT is contrary to EU law and that it should refer the matter to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 of the TFEU.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that this request is a challenge to the jurisdiction of the District Court. That initially appeared to be the view of the Respondent as well. In a letter to the Tribunal, dated 3 April 2013, the Respondent referred to the Reply which had been filed in the District Court (but which the Claimant had not then seen) and stated that \"the National Council objected to the jurisdiction of the national court on grounds of incompatibility between the provisions of the treaty and EU law\". That statement is repeated, in what the Respondent describes as a \"cut and paste mistake,\"212 in the Supplementary Statement of Defence, although the Supplementary Statement of Defence goes on to state that the Reply involved a submission to the jurisdiction of the Slovak courts.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional Hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 157.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, notwithstanding the way in which the Respondent initially characterised the Reply, it does not entail a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Bratislava District Court. The Reply repeats a point made by the Respondent in the arbitration proceedings, that the BIT is invalid because of what it maintains is a conflict with EL! law. In the context of the arbitration proceedings, that argument was plainly a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Tribunal derives its jurisdiction from the BIT; accordingly if the BIT is invalid, then it necessarily follows that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. The argument has a different character before the District Court. The District Court does not derive its jurisdiction from the BIT but from Slovak Jaw. The EU law argument of the Respondent in the Slovak proceedings was coupled with a request for a preliminary reference to the CJEU. For a national court to make a reference to the CJEU is an exercise of jurisdiction. Moreover, a ruling given under TFEU Article 234 in response to such a reference must then be applied to the facts of the individual case by the national court which made the reference, thus involving yet another exercise of that court\u2019s jurisdiction. As a matter of principle, therefore, the Tribunal cannot view the Reply as a challenge to the jurisdiction of the District Court.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal has also carefully considered the expert evidence submitted by the Parties on Slovak law. Dr Br\u00f4stl, the Claimant\u2019s expert, considered that the Respondent\u2019s EU law argument in its Reply \"de facto denies the jurisdiction of the District Court\".213 The Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr Klucka, on the other hand, concluded that \"the request by the Respondent for referral to the CJEU presupposes the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court. Otherwise, such legal act would have no sense and no legal effects.\"214 The Tribunal is not sure that there is any real difference between the two experts as to the law; it notes the important qualifying term \"de facto\" in Dr Br\u00f3stl\u2019s opinion. However, to the extent that there is a difference between them, the Tribunal prefers the evidence of Dr Klucka on this point, since it seems more logical and more in accord with the principles regarding the relationship between national courts and the CJEU under Article 234 of the TFEU.\n\nBr\u00f4stl Opinion, para. 30.\n\nKlu\u00e8ka Opinion, para. 21.\n\n186.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider that the Respondent challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court by contesting the designation of the National Council as the correct defendant in the action. That challenge is couched in terms that expressly invited the designation of a different defendant and accepted that proceedings could be continued once this had been done.215\n\nExhibit R-20, p. 2.\n\n187.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal cannot simply ignore the fact that the Respondent itself initially characterized its position as a challenge to the jurisdiction of the District Court and even repeated that characterization in its Supplementary Statement of Defence, even though it contradicted itself only a page later. The Tribunal accepts counsel's explanation that this was a misstatement but, at the very least, it demonstrates considerable confusion on the part of the Respondent\u2019s representatives about precisely what steps the Respondent had taken. If the Respondent\u2019s own experienced counsel could be confused on this important point, it is easy to see how the Claimant (or a reasonable person in the same position as the Claimant) could suffer from similar confusion.\n\n188.\n\nThus the Tribunal is faced with deciding whether an agreement to determine the dispute otherwise than by arbitration was concluded on the basis of an offer, contained in the Petition, which expressly stated that the primary forum was arbitration and requested suspension of the proceedings pending the decision of the Arbitration Tribunal, and an acceptance in terms which confused the Respondent\u2019s own legal team about whether the Respondent was accepting or rejecting the jurisdiction of the Slovak courts. The Tribunal has no hesitation in concluding that no such agreement to have the dispute determined by the Slovak court could be, or was, concluded on that basis. The conclusion that no agreement was made renders it unnecessary for the tribunal to consider the difference between the Parties\u2019 experts on Slovak law regarding the degree of formality which would be required for an agreement.\n\n**IV. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT HAS WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO ARBITRATE**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** The Positions of the Parties\n-----------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n189.\n\nUnder Swedish law as *lex arbitri,* the Respondent contends that the Claimant has irrevocably waived its right to arbitration by filing the Petition in the Bratislava Court.216 The Respondent maintains that the right to arbitrate a dispute is not absolute217 and that the initiation of a court action constitutes a waiver of \"the right to invoke an arbitration agreement with respect to the legal relationship to which the claim refers.\"218\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, paras. 18, 20 citing L. Heuman, *Arbitration Law of Sweden: Practice and Procedure* (2003), pp. 127-128 (Exhibit RL-443).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 20 citing L. Heuman, *Arbitration Law of Sweden: Practice and Procedure* (2003), pp. 116-117 (Exhibit RL-443).\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Swedish law - applicable by virtue of the Tribunal\u2019s designation of Stockholm as the place of the arbitration219 - deems that the commencement of court proceedings constitutes a unilateral waiver of the right to arbitration. According to Professor Heuman, the Respondent's expert on Swedish law,\n\n... under applicable Swedish law, upon submitting its Petition to the Bratislava Court, EURAM appears to have waived its right to arbitrate; at least it is clear that EURAM has done so by pursuing the Court proceedings during a long period of time. Thus, even assuming *arguendo* that EURAM\u2019s Petition did not itself constitute a waiver, EURAM thereafter waived its right to arbitrate by virtue of its conduct in the litigation, including given that EURAM\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with its stated conservatory intent upon the filing of its Petition.220\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 119, citing Swedish Arbitration Act, Section 48, available at http://www.chamber, se/?id~23 746 (Exhibit RL-485); Heuman Opinion, para. 23.\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 7.\n\n191.\n\nIn evidence adopted in argument by the Respondent, Professor Heuman maintains that, under the Swedish Arbitration Act (\"SAA\"), a party who commences court proceedings \"commits a fundamental breach of the [arbitration] agreement entitling the other party to terminate the arbitration agreement.\"221 Furthermore, a declaration by the litigant that it wishes to maintain a parallel arbitration proceeding does not avoid such a waiver, since this declaration is irreconcilable with the instigation of litigation, and an act prevails over a statement when there is a conflict between the two.222 The Respondent notes that this principle is also recognized by many leading arbitration jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, France, England, and Germany, as well as prominent international arbitration scholars such as Fouchard, Gaillard & Goldman and Poudret & Besson.223\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 120-122, citing Heuman Opinion, para. 24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 121, 144-146, citing Heuman Opinion, paras. 25-26, 33-34.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 123-125, citing E.

Besson, *Droit Compare de / 'Arbitrage International* (2nd ed., 2007), para. 379 (Exhibit RL-472).\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon the award in *Alucoal v. NKAZ,* where a Stockholm Chamber of Commerce tribunal found that Alucoal had irrevocably waived its right to arbitrate by bringing a court action against NKAZ in New York in order to claim damages based on the same contracts and facts as in the arbitration.224 In so finding, the tribunal distinguished Alucoal's court action from a court action seeking interim measures, which Sections 4(2) and (3) of the SAA do not consider a waiver of the right to arbitrate.225\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 21, citing B.A. Johnsson, *Waiving the Right to Arbitrate by Initiating Court Proceedings.* Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, pp. 1012 (Exhibit RL-441).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 21 citing B.A. Johnsson, *Waiving the Right io Arbitrate by Initiating Court Proceedings.* Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, pp. 1012 (Exhibit RL-441).\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Article 26(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules - which states that \"[a] request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial authority shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate, or a waiver of that agreement\" - implies that \"[i]n a context *other than* a request for interim measures, a petition to a judicial authority regarding matters falling squarely within the scope of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement is [...] an outright waiver of [the arbitration] agreement\" (emphasis in the original).226 The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of this article, as well as the Explanatory Note to the equivalent provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, explicitly acknowledge this possibility.227 The Respondent adds that the Petition is, by definition, not equivalent to a request for interim measures since it seeks a judgment on the merits which could be incompatible with this Tribunal\u2019s own Award.228\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 126-127, citing UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976), Article 26(3) and UNCITRAL Arbitral Rules (2010), Article 26(9).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 126-134 citing Report of the Secretary-General: revised draft set of arbitration rules for optional use in ad hoc arbitration relating to international trade (UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), U.N.

Contrary to the position that the Claimant advanced before this Tribunal, the Claimant invoked the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court based on the direct applicability of the Treaty in the Slovak legal order.229 Moreover, according to the Respondent, the claims made in the Petition are also identical to the claims made in this arbitration, including the Claimant\u2019s claims arising under Article 5 of the Treaty.230 In addition, as expressed by Professor Kl\u00fccka, the Respondent\u2019s expert on Slovak law, the Petition cannot be characterized as a request for interim measures because it seeks to have the Claimant's Treaty claims resolved on the merits.231\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 136, citing First Hearing on Jurisdiction, Transcript (19 December 2011), pp. 2ll:l2to2l2:3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 137 citing Petition, paras. 76, 83 and Klu\u00e8ka Opinion, para. 7; Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Statement of Defence, para. 22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 138 citing Klu\u00e8ka Opinion, paras. 18, 27.\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the Petition is not conditioned on the absence of arbitral jurisdiction to decide the Treaty claims. According to the Respondent, the only condition expressed in the Petition was a request for suspension in deference to the arbitration if a referral to the Constitutional Court was not forthcoming.232 The Respondent also points out that the Claimant persisted with its Article 5 Treaty claim before the Bratislava Court even after the Tribunal had found that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim.233 The Respondent further asserts that it did not contest the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court and in fact promptly accepted its jurisdiction upon the National Council\u2019s procurement of legal counsel.234\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 139 citing Petition, paras. 118. 120.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 140\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 141.\n\n197.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant cannot justify its commencement of the Bratislava Court proceedings by reference to an alleged conservatory purpose, since its claim was not in danger of being prescribed, and even if the Tribunal adopted the reasoning of the *Austrian Airlines* tribunal and dismissed the Claimant's other claims, this would not oust the Article 5 claims.235\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 148-149 citing *Austrian Airlines AG* v. *Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award (9 October 2009) (G. Kaufmann-Kohler, C, Brower, V. Trapl), para. 136 (Exhibit RL-23).\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the four-year statute of limitations of the Commercial Code would apply to this dispute instead of the three-year limitations period under Section 583 of the Civil Code on which the Claimant relied.236 The Respondent also contends that the limitations period would not have started running upon publication of the HICA on 24 November 2007 (as the Claimant had alleged), but only once the HICA took effect (January 2008) or actually prevented the Claimant from carrying out a transfer from Slovakia outwards (April or May 2009).237 Even if the Claimant were correct about when the limitation period began running, however, the Respondent insists that the Claimant filed the Petition \"one year sooner than necessary to avoid [the] time-bar.\"238 The Respondent further points out that the Claimant could have invoked the present arbitration to extend the limitation period under either Commercial Code Section 405(2) - or under Article 10.6(1) of the UNIDROIT Principles, which can be used to interpret and supplement the Slovak Commercial Code - until after the Tribunal had ruled on its jurisdiction.239\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 152-153 citing Klucka Opinion, para. 28.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 154-155, citing Klucka Opinion, para. 30.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 154, citing Klucka Opinion, para. 31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 156-161, citing Klucka Opinion, para. 37; UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (2010), Art. 10.6 (Exhibit RL-490).\n\n199.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s subsequent conduct confirms that its Petition was not merely conservatory. Rather than seeking agreement to defer the Bratislava Court proceedings, the Claimant in fact strongly opposed the Respondent\u2019s requests that the court proceedings be adjourned or extended to give the Respondent the opportunity to seek proper representation.240 The Claimant also failed to embrace two out of the three grounds for suspension of the court proceedings advanced by the Respondent in its 29 February 2012 Reply to the Bratislava Court, whereas the Respondent argues that had the Claimant's object in filing the Petition genuinely been purely conservatory, it would have supported any request for the suspension of proceedings.241\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 164-165 citing *(c.f)* *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A S* v *Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction on 14 November 2005, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29 (G.

In this context, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant never advanced its request for the suspension of the court proceedings in favour of arbitration, nor reiterated that its \"primary forum\" for dispute resolution was arbitration.242 Instead, the Claimant continued pushing its Treaty claims before the Bratislava Court.243 In particular, the Claimant\u2019s 16 July 2012 and 8 August 2012 Statements requested that the Bratislava Court dismiss the Respondent\u2019s suspension request and proceed to a judgment on the merits of the Claimant\u2019s Treaty claims, including its Article 5 claim.244 The Respondent also notes that, on 14 January 2013, three months after the Tribunal had held that it had jurisdiction to decide the Article 5 claim and the very same day that the Claimant asked this Tribunal to resume the arbitration proceedings,245 the Claimant filed a motion in the Bratislava Court seeking the production by the Respondent of the *Achmea v. Slovak Republic I* Final Award.246 According to the Respondent, given that the *Achmea* / tribunal found that the Respondent had violated the transfers provision of the Dutch-Slovak BIT, this request must have been made in order to use the *Achmea* \u2044 award in support of the Article 5 claims in the court proceedings.247\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 167.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 168.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 169-171, citing EURAM\u2019s response to Respondent\u2019s Statement delivered to the Court on I March 2012. dated 16 July 2012, pp. 2, 7, 10 (Exhibit R-23) and EURAM\u2019s Statement to the Further Evidence Produced by Respondent, dated 8 August 2012, p. 3 (Exhibit R-24).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 173, citing EURAM\u2019s Letter to the Tribunal, dated 14 January 2013, p.

A claimant resisting a stay of the court proceedings or the respondent\u2019s application for a respite demonstrates claimant's intention and decision to litigate the dispute.\"249 The Respondent highlights various actions by the Claimant subsequent to the filing of the Petition that it argues can have no conservatory purpose: (i) refusing to stay or defer the court proceedings; (ii) asking the Court to review its Treaty claims on the merits and attempting to accelerate such review; (iii) maintaining its Article 5 claim in the court proceedings even after the Tribunal upheld jurisdiction over that claim; and (iv) requesting the production of evidence in the court proceeding seemingly in support of its Article 5 claim.250\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 178-180, citing Heuman Opinion, para. 35.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 176, citing Heuman Opinion, para. 36.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 177-178, citing Heuman Opinion, para. 36.\n\n***2. The Claimant***\n---------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s exposition of the applicable legal principles. The Claimant initially notes that the present case does not fall under Section 5 of the SAA.251 According to the Claimant, this section comprehensively lists the situations under which a party is deemed to have forfeited its right to invoke the arbitration agreement. Apart from these instances, the initiation of litigation does not constitute a waiver of the right to arbitration unless a traditional contract law analysis evinces an agreement between the Parties to that effect.252 As such, a unilateral statement must be clear and unequivocal in order to be construed as a waiver; otherwise, \"a nuanced approach based on the interpretation of the words used or action taken by a party\" is required, rather than resort to \"unreflected self-serving truism[s] that ignore[] the facts of the case.'\u2019253 An analysis according to general principles such as Article 4.2 of the UNIDROIT Principles would not differ in substance.254\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 88, citing Runeland Opinion, para. 35.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 89. citing Runeland Opinion, para. 36.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 91-92, citing L.

NKAZ.258* The Claimant states that *Alucoal* initiated court proceedings two months before it commenced an arbitration seeking the same relief under the contracts and argued strongly in favour of the jurisdiction of the court while at the same time hiding the existence of the arbitration clauses covering the dispute.259 By contrast, in the present case, not only did both Parties contest the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court, but the Claimant also affirmed its preference for arbitration as the primary means of resolving its claims and expressly reserved its rights in that regard.260 in the present case, the cause of action in the litigation is based on domestic law and alternatively formulated as an expropriation claim, which the present arbitration does not concern.261\n\n*Alucoal* v *NKAZ,* Second Interim Award, dated 14 April 2004, Case No. 022/2001 (Exhibit CL-210).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 96-99 citing *Alucoal,* paras. 10-11,45,55, 65.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 98.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 99.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimant also distinguishes the other Swedish cases cited by the Respondent and its Swedish law expert, Professor Heuman, on the same basis.262 The Claimant points out that in all three cases - namely, *Lebam* v. *Hans Schroder,263 Hytten* v. *Lennart Huhenberger,264* and *Svealand Kanal v. Norska Postverket265 -* the claimants, despite having the option of commencing arbitration under the contract, deliberately chose to pursue their claims through summary court proceedings based on the bills of exchange without making any reservation with regard to the arbitration agreement or having any other compelling reason for doing so.266\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 134-135.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 135, citing (Exhibit LH-5).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 135, citing (Exhibit LH-6).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 135, citing (Exhibit LH-7).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 136-140.\n\n206.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Swedish Court of Appeal further affirmed these principles in the matter of *Arkhangelskoe Geologodobychnoe Predpriyatie* v. *Archangel* *Diamond Corporation,* where it held that Diamond had not waived its right to arbitrate the dispute by commencing proceedings in the Colorado courts while it sought to set aside an arbitral tribunal dismissal of its claims for lack of jurisdiction.267 The Swedish Court of Appeal held that the waiver of the right to arbitrate must be considered on a case-by-case basis and that there was no waiver because Diamond was merely \"seeking different navigable roads in order [to] press its claims\", had consistently upheld the validity of the arbitration agreement, and had not otherwise agreed with Arkhangelskoe that the arbitration agreement would cease to apply.268 Thus, in the Claimant's view, \"even a pursuit of the litigation that is much more active than Claimant\u2019s conservatory approach in the Slovak proceedings does not *per se* imply a waiver of the arbitration agreement,\" as long as the actions of a party cannot be understood as a clear waiver or offer to contract out of an arbitration agreement.269\n\nClaimant\u2018s Rebuttal, para. 126, citing *Arkhangelskoe Geologodobychnoe Predpriyatie* v. *Archangel Diamond Corporation,* Judgment of 20 February 2004.

Anna Stina H271* - are simply inapposite, as they concern situations involving extensive negotiations between the parties.272\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 142, citing *Baladi,* NJA 1977, Nr. 19 (Exhibit LH-16).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 142, citing *Stina-H,* NJA 1992, Nr.38 (Exhibit LH-17).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 141-146.\n\n208.\n\nTurning to the facts of this case, the Claimant rejects the contention that its commencement of court proceedings was inconsistent with the fact of maintaining and pursuing its claims in the arbitration at the same time.273\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 110, citing Heuman Opinion, para. 25.\n\n209.\n\nFirst, the Claimant identifies two facts that would preclude the Respondent from having reasonably understood that the Claimant had intended to litigate rather than arbitrate its claims: (a) the Petition, which was coupled with a request to suspend the proceedings, indicated that arbitration was the primary forum for the Claimant\u2019s claims and that the Petition itself was filed merely to prevent the Claimant\u2019s claims from becoming time-barred; and (b) the fact that the Claimant maintained its opposition to the full range of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections within the arbitration.274\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 111.\n\n210.\n\nHowever, even if the Respondent could have understood that the Claimant intended to abandon the arbitration, the Claimant contends that the Respondent did not in fact rely on this understanding, as it objected to the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court and did not reply to the Petition on the merits.275 Nor did the Respondent suffer any detriment, or alter its position in reliance on the Slovak court proceedings.276\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 113.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 114.\n\n211.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant insists that the Slovak proceedings have a purely conservatory purpose consistent with maintaining its claims in the arbitration.277 According to the Claimant, since the Respondent did not make any statement rejecting the Claimant\u2019s statements regarding the primacy of arbitration for the dispute resolution or the conservatory purpose of the Petition, any offer made by the Claimant through the Petition - and accepted by the Respondent in its Reply to the Petition - necessarily included agreement that the arbitration was the primary forum for resolution of the dispute and that the Petition was merely conservatory in nature.278 This is, in the Claimant\u2019s view, bolstered by the fact that the Respondent objected to the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court.279\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 123.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 123-125, citing Heuman Opinion, paras. 36-38.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 125.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant clarifies that the conservatory purpose for its Petition is not only based on the *Austrian Airlines* case and also covers its Article 5 claim before the Bratislava Court.280 The Claimant alleges that it did not and could not know the full range of jurisdictional objections that the Respondent would raise in the arbitration, which could potentially lead to the dismissal of its Article 5 claim in addition to its other claims.281 That remains the case, since even \"[a]fter the issue of the jurisdictional award, [the] Claimant\u2019s Article 5 claim is still under risk of being dismissed on jurisdictional grounds as much as it was before simply because Respondent's remaining jurisdictional objections are not yet dismissed.\"282 The Claimant thus explains that it did not and cannot withdraw its Article 5 claim from the Bratislava Court proceeding even after the Tribunal had found jurisdiction over this claim without defeating the conservatory purpose of the Petition.283\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 69, citing (Exhibit RL-23).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 69.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 68.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 68.\n\n213.\n\nThirdly, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the four-year limitation period under the Commercial Code is applicable instead of the three-year period under the Slovak Civil Code.284 The Claimant contends that the Commercial Code is inapplicable as a whole to this case because \"a dispute arising from the abuse of sovereign power or a violation of constitutional rights and guaranties by the State is not a commercial matter.\"285 This would also render impossible an application for extension of the applicable period under Article 405(2) of the Commercial Code.286 The Claimant notes that Professor Klu\u00e8ka, the Respondent\u2019s expert on Slovak law, bases his analysis on comparing the Claimant\u2019s activity in the Slovak Republic and the relationship between the Claimant and Respondent as one between a joint stock company and its shareholders when, in reality, \"the Claimant\u2019s claims are not claims against its subsidiary for dividends but claims against the State for the violation of its right to obtain dividends by the abuse of legislative power and/or the violation of constitutional rights and guarantees.\"287\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 70.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 71.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 72.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 73-74, citing Klucka Opinion, para. 28 and Br\u00f4stl Opinion, para. 35.\n\n214.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant notes that it was required to take a precautionary approach and could not rule out the possibility that the Bratislava Court might apply the shorter three-year limitation period under the Slovak Civil Code rather than the four-year limitation period under the Commercial Code.288 The Claimant further argues that it must be assumed that the Respondent would have raised and strongly asserted such defences.289 The Claimant also cites and dismisses the suggestion that the UNIDROIT Principles could be read into the Slovak Civil Code.290\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, paras. 75.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 76.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 77-78.\n\n215.\n\nFourthly, as to the Respondent\u2019s argument regarding Article 26(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimant argues that, although not technically a request for interim measures, its Petition is similar in nature given the uncertainty regarding the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.291 Moreover, the Claimant also emphasizes that this provision envisages one key situation where parallel court proceedings are not incompatible with arbitration, but it does not purport to exclude other instances where a party to an arbitration agreement may be forced to commence court proceedings.292 The Claimant likens its case to that of the investor in the *Occidental v. Ecuador* case, where the investor was forced to make an application before the local courts in order to protect its rights under the Ecuadorian Tax law.293 In the present case, the Claimant submits that it had to file the Petition in order to prevent its claims from being time-barred, and that it requested that the Bratislava Court suspend the proceedings until the Tribunal had issued its first jurisdictional Award.294\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 131.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras 132-133.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 133, citing *Occidental* v. *Ecuador, supra* note 148, paras. 57-58.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 133.\n\n216.\n\nLastly, the Claimant also explains that its Petition is not conditioned on the absence of arbitral jurisdiction because the Slovak legal system does not allow conditional lawsuits.295 The fact that the Claimant filed an unconditional lawsuit cannot therefore support the waiver theory of the Respondent.296\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 82, citing Br\u00f4stl Opinion, para. 35.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para 82.\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that its subsequent conduct in the court proceedings is fully consistent with its conservatory purpose and also does not establish any intention to waive its right to arbitration.\n\n218.\n\nFirst, the Claimant disputes the relevance of the duration or complexity of the litigation or the number of submissions filed, because it encompasses lapsed time and other factors over which the Claimant had no control and the Claimant also points to various submissions filed by both Parties consistent with its position in favour of this arbitration.297\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 119-122, citing Heuman Opinion, paras. 35-36 and Exhibits R-21, R-22, R-23, R-29, and R-30.\n\n219.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant also disputes the relevance of its opposition to the Respondent\u2019s requests for time extensions or to stay the court proceedings, noting that its own request for a stay of the proceedings had been before the Bratislava Court since the filing of its Petition.298 The Claimant further explains that it opposed the Respondent\u2019s extension request in its 3 August 2011 letter to the Bratislava Court because of its concern that these requests were a form of tactical manoeuvring on false pretence of a public procurement process that had not been conducted for two other similar cases (which the Respondent has now admitted was never conducted in this case either).299 It also highlights that this letter informed the Bratislava Court of the August 2011 jurisdictional hearing in this arbitration, which was later rescheduled.300 The Claimant also rejects the Respondent\u2019s insinuation, based on the ICSID case of *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* that the Claimant should have sought an agreement with the Respondent to defer the Slovak court proceedings under Section 110 of the Slovak Civil Procedure Code. The Claimant explains that, in that case, the Parties simply traded a stay of the parallel contract arbitration for a deferral that had the same effect.301 Moreover, the Claimant states that \"it would be fair enough to say that we have not asked Respondent to agree on a suspension as it would be fair to say that Respondent has not asked us to agree on a suspension\"302 and asserts that seeking such an agreement would not have made sense given the discrepancy in the Parties\u2019 positions underlying their respective requests for suspension.303\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 121, citing Heuman Opinion, para. 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 86-89, citing Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 164-165 and Exhibit R-I4, pp. 2-3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 91.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 92, citing Exhibit CL-9, pp. 1-2, 12-13.\n\nTranscript (16 September 2013), 180:10-16.\n\nTranscript (16 September 2013), 181:8-182:11.\n\n220.\n\nThirdly, the Claimant rejects the idea that it was required to push its request for the suspension of the Bratislava Court proceedings or otherwise reiterate that arbitration was its desired primary forum for its claims. According to the Claimant, in Slovak civil litigation, once a request is made it remains on record until resolved and need not be constantly renewed.304 To illustrate this point, the Claimant points to the 7 January 2013 Bratislava Court resolution dismissing all of the Respondent\u2019s pending suspension requests, as well as one of the Claimant\u2019s, and expressly mentioned the Claimant\u2019s stated conservatory purpose and position on the arbitration.305 The Claimant also points to the Bratislava Court\u2019s 31 October 2012 notice asking whether the Claimant maintained its application to suspend the proceedings to which the Claimant responded on 16 November 2012, indicating that it maintained that request.306\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, para. 93 citing Exhibit CL-9. pp. 1-2, 12-13.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 95 citing Exhibit R-25.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 94 citing Exhibits R-31 and R-32.\n\n221.\n\nFourthly, the Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that it should have joined the Respondent\u2019s suspension requests. According to the Claimant, all three requests were equally premised on the invalidity of the BIT, and so it could not agree to them.307 Moreover, the Claimant had already made its own suspension requests under some of the same provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.308\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 96-99.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 99.\n\n222.\n\nLastly, the Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Claimant actively pushed its treaty claims, including its Article 5 claim, before the Bratislava Court. The Claimant notes that the evidence the Respondent relies on - namely, the Claimant\u2019s 16 July 2012 and 8 August 2012 statements - both predate the Tribunal\u2019s Award on Jurisdiction issued on 22 October 2012.309 In addition, both statements also merely defend its position on EU law and the validity of the BIT and partially repeat what was in the Petition, which remained subject to the proviso that the arbitration remains the primary forum.310 The Claimant insists that even litigation based on a solely conservatory purpose must make a request from the court.311\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 100.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rebuttal, paras. 101-103.\n\nClaimant's Rebuttal, para. 101.\n\n**B.** The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe waiver objection is based upon arguments of Swedish law and both Parties have submitted expert reports from experts on Swedish law. The Respondent has relied upon an opinion from Professor Lars Heuman, while the Claimant has relied upon two opinions by Mr. Per Runeland. The Tribunal approaches this objection on the basis that the law applicable to the question whether or not there has been a waiver is Swedish law. The Tribunal will also refer, where appropriate, to Slovak law, as the law which governs the procedure of the Bratislava Court, in assessing the various steps taken by the Parties in the Slovak proceedings.\n\n***(1) The Standard under Swedish Law***\n----------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe two Swedish law experts, whose opinions the Tribunal has found of great assistance,312 agree that under Swedish law the right to arbitrate can be lost by waiver. They also agree that a party does not waive its right to arbitrate by going to a national court for interim measures of protection, though both necessarily accept that this was not what the Claimant did in commencing the Bratislava Court proceedings. Beyond that, they disagree about the circumstances in which commencing court proceedings constitutes waiver. Both consider that, in order to amount to a waiver, an action must be clear. However, Professor Heuman considers that \"a party who starts court proceedings has made a clear waiver\"313 and that \"[i]n light of the principle in Swedish law that instigating litigation means a waiver, it cannot unilaterally be made ineffective by the claimant [...] declaring that the claimant wants to keep its right to arbitration in a case where it has acted contrary to the arbitration agreement\".314 By contrast, Mr. Runeland considers that Swedish law does not altogether exclude the possibility of a party simultaneously litigating and arbitrating the same issue.315 He urges a \"nuanced approach\".316\n\nIt is clear from Mr. Runeland\u2019s Second Opinion, para. 1 that Mr. Runeland\u2019s First Opinion was written without his having seen many of the documents on which the waiver by conduct argument is based and that certain significant papers were shown him only when he was preparing his Second Opinion. It is therefore to that Second Opinion that the Tribunal will chiefly refer.\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 26.\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 33.\n\nRuneland Second Opinion, para. 16.\n\nRuneland Second Opinion, para. 16.\n\n225.\n\nIn fact, there is less difference between the two experts than might at first sight appear. Professor Heuman maintains that, where a party has behaved inconsistently, it is necessary to look at its conduct taken as a whole.317 He notes the Claimant\u2019s statement in the Petition that \"the venue was purely hypothetical and a placeholder to guard against a statute of limitation bar under Slovak law in the event the arbitral tribunal would deny jurisdiction\" and considers that \"this may possibly be an acceptable reason for starting court proceedings in spite of the existence of an arbitration agreement\".318 He concludes:\n\nHowever, EURAM is not allowed under the arbitration agreement to take *substantially more extensive procedural actions in the court proceedings than are needed to prevent its claim from becoming statute-barred.* A claimant resisting a stay of the court proceedings or the respondent's application for a respite demonstrates claimant\u2019s intention and decision to litigate the dispute. Such resolution may also be evident from claimant\u2019s submissions and evidence presented in the case. The number of claimant\u2019s filings and their extensiveness and complexity may be factors speaking in favour of a waiver as well as the duration of the litigation.319 (Emphasis added.)\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 26.\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 36.\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 36.\n\n226.\n\nMr. Runeland\u2019s \"nuanced approach\" led him to the conclusion that\n\n... because EURAM Bank clearly described the background to the Bratislava court action, stating that the arbitral tribunal was the primary forum, brought a broader action in Bratislava, *and did just what was necessary to keep it alive as a precautionary measure,* EURAM Bank did not waive the arbitration agreement.320 (Emphasis added.)\n\nRuneland Second Opinion, para. 38\n\n227.\n\nThe passages which the Tribunal has highlighted in the above quotations suggest that, while the two experts drew different conclusions on the basis of the record of the Bratislava proceedings (to the extent that they had been shown all the relevant documents), the standard which they applied was essentially the same, namely whether the Claimant had gone beyond what was necessary to prevent its claim in Slovakia from becoming statute-barred. The Tribunal will, therefore, apply that standard to the facts before it.\n\n228.\n\nBefore doing so, however, there are a number of other points concerning Swedish law which the Tribunal wishes to emphasise. First, Mr. Runeland referred, in his First Opinion, to the award of the Swedish arbitration tribunal in *Alucoal v. NKAZ,* which was also much discussed by the Parties. He considered that \"the essential difference between *Alucoal* and the case before us is that Alucoal, but not Euram Bank, brought the court action before instigating the arbitration, and did it without any reservation concerning the action under the agreement to arbitrate\".321 The Tribunal has studied the *Alucoal* award with care and is not persuaded that the first difference noted by Mr. Runeland can be regarded as significant. Although the *Alucoal* tribunal referred, in paragraph 55 of the award, to the fact that Alucoal had initiated proceedings in New York before commencing arbitration, there is nothing in the award to suggest that this fact was considered in any way decisive; on the contrary, the reference in paragraph 55 of the *Alucoal* award appears to be descriptive and nothing more. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Runeland did not return to this point in his Second Opinion, even though it was obvious that Professor Heuman considered that litigation commenced after arbitration proceedings had started could constitute a waiver under Swedish law. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Swedish law confines waiver to the initiation of court proceedings before an arbitration has been commenced.322\n\nRuneland First Opinion, para. 44.\n\nMr Runeland\u2019s second ground for distinguishing *Alucoal* from the present case is considered below.\n\n229.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal notes two other aspects of *Alucoal* which are relevant to the present case. The tribunal there was clear that the commencement of court proceedings in a State other than the seat of the arbitration was capable of constituting waiver. Moreover, the *Alucoal* tribunal considered that in order to amount to waiver, the court proceedings did not have to be identical to the arbitration but that it was sufficient that they included the arbitral cause of action. The Tribunal agrees with both points.\n\n230.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal has carefully considered the judgments of the Swedish courts in the case of *Arkhangelskoe Geologodobychnoe Predpriyatie* v. *Archangel Diamond Corporation* (paragraph 206, above). While these judgments are of considerable interest, the Tribunal considers that the facts of the *Arkhangelskoe* case are sufficiently different from those of the present case that they afford little guidance. In particular, Arkhangelskoe had actively contested the jurisdiction of the Colorado courts, whereas the Tribunal has already found (see paragraph 184, above) that the Slovak Republic did not contest the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court.\n\n***(2) Application of Swedish Law to the Facts***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThere is an inevitable degree of overlap between the submissions of the Parties regarding the issue of waiver and those on the Respondent's argument that there was an agreement. It is appropriate, therefore, for the Tribunal to begin by recalling that, in its decision on the latter issue it has already settled a number of the points in issue between the Parties as regards the waiver argument.\n\n232.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has accepted that, in filing its Petition with the Bratislava Court, the Claimant made clear that it considered that the arbitration was the primary forum for the determination of its BIT claims (paragraph 179, above).\n\n233.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal has accepted that the Claimant commenced proceedings in the Bratislava Court in order to guard against the possibility that, if the Tribunal ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the BIT claims, the Claimant would be unable to pursue an action in the Bratislava Court because it would be time barred (paragraph 179, above). In that context, the Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant would in fact have benefitted from a longer period in which to bring proceedings than the one which the Claimant considered to be applicable but repeats that the Claimant was entitled to take a conservative view on this point since its whole purpose was to insure against a risk of being time barred (see paragraph 180, above).\n\n234.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant\u2019s analysis of the Respondent's response to the Petition as a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court. While the Respondent has at times made contradictory and confused remarks about the nature of that response, for the reasons already given, the Tribunal considers that - far from challenging the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Court - the Respondent invoked that jurisdiction by asking the Court to make a preliminary reference to the CJEU (see paragraphs 183 to 184, above).\n\n235.\n\nIt is in the light of these earlier conclusions that the Tribunal will approach the issue of the waiver.\n\n236.\n\nAs the Tribunal has explained, the Respondent puts its waiver objection in two ways (as encapsulated in the passage from Professor Heuman\u2019s Opinion quoted in paragraph 190, above), namely that the very act of filing the Petition amounts to a waiver and that, even if *(arguendo)* the Claimant did not waive its right to arbitrate by that act, its subsequent conduct has to be regarded as a waiver. The Tribunal has already held that the Respondent was not entitled to raise a jurisdictional objection on the first basis, because it had delayed for too long after it became aware of the Petition before raising its waiver objection (see paragraphs 129-130, above). The Tribunal will therefore consider only the argument that the Claimant\u2019s subsequent conduct amounted to a waiver.\n\n237.\n\nThat does not, of course, mean that the Petition becomes irrelevant. It is the background against which all the subsequent procedural steps were taken and thus requires careful consideration. For that reason, and because the Parties and their respective experts have considered the matter in great detail, the Tribunal will begin with an analysis of that Petition.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that the claim advanced by the Claimant in the Petition is substantially the same as the claim advanced in the arbitration; indeed, the Claimant itself, at paragraph 13 of the Petition, described its Treaty claim advanced in the Petition as based upon \"identical legal reasoning\" to that put forward in support of its claim in the arbitration. While the Petition also relied upon the Constitution of the Slovak Republic and the European Convention on Human Rights, it undoubtedly included (to use the terms of the *Alucoal* award) the entirety of the claim in the arbitration proceedings.\n\n239.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant made clear, when filing the Petition, that its action was merely \"a placeholder to guard against a statute of limitation bar under Slovak law in the event the arbitral tribunal would deny jurisdiction\" (paragraph 225, above). The Tribunal agrees that such an action would not constitute a waiver under Swedish law. Moreover, it notes that the Respondent did not appear to treat it as such at the time (see paragraph 129, above). Accordingly, had the Tribunal not already determined that the Respondent\u2019s objection that the act of filing the Petition was, in and of itself, a waiver, was submitted too late, it would in any event have dismissed that objection on the merits.\n\n240.\n\nThat leaves the question whether the Claimant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the filing of the Petition constitutes a waiver. In that regard, the following acts require consideration:\n\n(1) the Claimant\u2019s opposition to the Respondent\u2019s requests for an extension of time in the District Court (3 August 2011 ; see paragraph 45, above);323\n\n(2) the Claimant\u2019s response to the Respondent\u2019s defence in the District Court (16 July 2012; see paragraph 64, above);324\n\n(3) the Claimant\u2019s response to the District Court\u2019s enquiry regarding its motion for suspension of the proceedings (16 November 2012; see paragraph 70, above);325\n\n(4) the Claimant\u2019s request for disclosure of the *Achmea* award (14 January 2013; see paragraph 73, above);326\n\n(5) the Claimant\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the District Court of 7 January 2013 (31 January 2013; see paragraph 75, above);327 and\n\n(6) the Claimant\u2019s response to the Respondent\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the District Court (3 April 2013; see paragraph 81 above).\n\nEach of these will be considered in turn, although it is necessary to bear in mind that it is their cumulative effect, rather than the significance of any one step taken in isolation, which has to be evaluated.\n\nExhibit R-14.\n\nExhibit R-23.\n\nExhibit R-32.\n\nExhibit R-26.\n\nExhibit R-28; the judgment of the District Court is Exhibit R-25.\n\n*(1) the Claimant's opposition to the Respondent's requests for an extension of time in the District Court (3 August 2011)*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe first of these events is significant in that the Claimant, having assured the Bratislava Court in the Petition, that it considered the arbitration to be the primary forum and having requested (on two different grounds) suspension of the proceedings before the Bratislava Court, nevertheless opposed a request by the Respondent which, if not bringing about a suspension as such, would have had a similar effect in that the next step in the proceedings would have been delayed. By itself, that opposition does not amount to much and the Claimant has explained that it was concerned that the Respondent was seeking to delay the proceedings for tactical reasons of its own. Nevertheless, the Claimant\u2019s action on this occasion - when it took the initiative of requesting the District Court to revoke an extension of time that the Court had already granted the Respondent - is the first indication that the Claimant was not determined to take all steps open to it to ensure that the timetable in the Bratislava proceedings did not clash with that in the arbitration. It is also significant that, while the document by which the Claimant opposed the extension of time referred to the arbitration proceedings and mentioned (as was the case) that a hearing on the jurisdictional issues was then scheduled to take place three weeks later, it neglected to mention that the Claimant had filed a challenge to Professor Stem which, had it been successful, would certainly have led to a substantial postponement of the hearing (see paragraph 45, above).\n\n*(2) the Claimant's response to the Respondent 's defence in the District Court (July 16, 2012)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nIn this document, the Claimant opposed the Respondent's motion for a preliminary reference to the CJEU under Article 234 of the TFEU. That was, of course, entirely consistent with the stance taken by the Claimant in the arbitration, since the Claimant has consistently argued that the BIT remains valid and binding upon Austria and the Slovak Republic, notwithstanding any provisions of EU law. The Claimant cannot, therefore, be criticised for not acceding to the Respondent\u2019s request, particularly since at the time that it filed its response (in accordance with the timetable set by the Bratislava Court), the Respondent expected the Tribunal\u2019s award on the original jurisdictional objections within a short time-frame.\n\n243.\n\nHowever, the response concludes with the following request to the Bratislava Court:\n\n...we request the District Court of Bratislava 1 to dismiss Respondent\u2019s request to suspend these proceedings and *award a decision in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Protection Agreement* [i.e. the BIT], which governs the legal relationship between Claimant and Respondent, as well as the claim brought by Claimant against Respondent in these proceedings.328 (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe Claimant made a similar statement in its response of 8 August 2012 to the further evidence produced by the Respondent.329\n\nExhibit R-23, para. 10.\n\nExhibit R-24.\n\n244.\n\nAlthough the Claimant denied that this passage was a \"prayer for relief\u2019,330 it is undoubtedly a request which informs the Court what the Claimant is asking it to do. That was to take a decision on the merits of the Claimant\u2019s BIT claim, something which is expressly singled out in the passage quoted. The Claimant made no mention of the timetable in the arbitration proceedings, of the fact that it had already said in the Petition that it considered the arbitration to be the primary forum or of its extant request for a stay of the proceedings pending the award of the Tribunal.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 110:12-18.\n\n*(3) the Claimant\u2019s response to the District Court's enquiry regarding its motion for suspension of the proceedings (16 November 2012)*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nOn 31 October 2012, the Bratislava Court wrote to the Claimant inquiring whether the Claimant was still requesting a stay of the proceedings and referring to the Constitutional Court judgment of 26 January 2011. No mention was made of the arbitration.331' The Tribunal had given Its First Award on the original jurisdictional objections on 22 October 2012, although the Court was not, of course, aware of that fact. The Claimant replied on 16 November 2012.332 The Claimant informed the Court that it was still requesting a stay of proceedings and referred to what it described as inconsistencies in the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court.\n\nExhibit R-31.\n\nExhibit R-33.\n\n246.\n\nWhile the letter from the Court referred only to the Claimant\u2019s request for a stay under Article 109(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Claimant did not, in its reply, remind the Court that it also had outstanding a second application for a stay. Nor did it inform the Court that the Tribunal had given its Award on the original jurisdictional objections in which it had held that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT, leaving only the Article 5 claim and that subject to the outcome of the new jurisdictional objections.\n\n*(4) the Claimant 's request for disclosure of the Achmea award (14 January 2013)*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nOn 14 January 2013, the Claimant wrote on its own initiative to the Court filing a Motion for evidence and the disclosure of information. In that motion it requested that the Respondent disclose the award on the merits in *Achmea BV* v. *Slovak Republic* on the grounds that it might be used as evidence in the proceedings before the Bratislava Court. The Respondent maintains that this request is of great significance as the *Achmea* award would have been relevant to an Article 5 claim and shows that the Claimant had decided to pursue such a claim before the Bratislava Court. The Tribunal does not consider that the Motion can be so unequivocally linked to the Article 5 claim. The *Achmea* award333 has broader implications for the Claimant\u2019s position on the BIT. Nevertheless, the award could have been relevant in the Bratislava proceedings only if those proceedings were to advance to the merits. Moreover, the Claimant did not take this opportunity to notify the Court of the First Award of this Tribunal or to advise the Court that, on the same day that it filed the Motion, it had notified the Tribunal that it intended to proceed with the Article 5 claim in the arbitration proceedings.\n\nExhibit RL-446.\n\n*(5) the Claimant's appeal against the judgment of the District Court of* 7 *January 2013 (3 J January 2013)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nAs recorded in paragraphs 71 to 72, above, on 7 January 2013, the Bratislava Court gave a judgment in which it dismissed the Claimant\u2019s request for a stay of the proceedings under Section 109(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure and the various motions from the Respondent but said nothing about the request for a stay pending the outcome of the arbitration proceedings. On 31 January 2013, the Claimant filed an appeal against that judgment.334 The appeal reiterated that the Claimant was \"seeking satisfaction regarding a breach of the specific provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty\". No mention was made of the fact that the judgment had not dealt with the request for a stay pending the outcome of the arbitration under Section 109(2)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure; nor did the Claimant mention the Award of 22 October 2012 or its decision to continue with its Article 5 claim before the Tribunal.\n\nExhibit R-28.\n\n*(6) the Claimant 's response to the Respondent 's appeal against the judgment of the District Court (3 April 2013)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Respondent also appealed against the judgment of the District Court.335 On 3 April 2013, the Claimant filed a response to the Respondent\u2019s appeal.336 The response contested the Respondent's argument that the District Court should have made a preliminary reference to the CJEU. In addressing that question, the Claimant referred to the award in *Eureko* but made no mention of the October 2012 Award of this Tribunal, even though it had reached the same conclusion as the *Eureko* tribunal on the EU law issue.\n\nExhibit R-27.\n\nExhibit R-34.\n\n250.\n\nIn addition to the positive steps taken by the Claimant, the Respondent also refers to what it says the Claimant did not do. In particular, it maintains that, once the Tribunal had given its Award of 22 October 2012, the Claimant should have withdrawn its Article 5 claim from the national proceedings as it was continuing to pursue that claim in the arbitration, a point also raised by Professor Heuman.337\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 22.\n\n251.\n\nIn assessing the significance of these steps for the issue of waiver, the Tribunal starts with its earlier finding (paragraph 239, above) that the act of the Claimant in commencing proceedings before the Bratislava Court was not a waiver of the right to arbitrate but only because the Petition made clear that the Claimant regarded the arbitration as the primary forum and brought the Bratislava proceedings only as a safeguard. That feature of the Petition is emphasised by both Mr. Runeland and Professor Heuman (see paragraphs 224 to 227, above). The question that now has to be decided is whether, in the nearly three years between the filing of the Petition and the hearing before the Tribunal in September 2013, the Claimant undertook what Professor Heuman described as \"substantially more extensive procedural actions in the court proceedings than are needed to prevent its claim from becoming statute-barred\"338 or, in Mr. Runeland\u2019s words, went beyond \"what was necessary to keep it alive as a precautionary measure\".339\n\nHeuman Opinion, para. 36.\n\nRuneland Second Opinion, para. 28.\n\n252.\n\nIn seeking to answer that question, it is important to be clear about the effect of the Award of 22 October 2012. In that Award, the Tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction with regard to the claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT but rejected the Respondent\u2019s original jurisdictional objections to the claim under Article 5. That did not mean, however, that the Tribunal had settled the issue of jurisdiction in respect of the Article 5 claim, as the new jurisdictional objections lodged on 22 April 2012 remained. Accordingly, the effect of the 22 October 2012 Award was that jurisdiction over the Article 5 claim remained uncertain.\n\n253.\n\nIn those circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the fact the Claimant did not withdraw its Article 5 claim before the Bratislava Court when it notified the Tribunal, on 14 January 2013, that it wished to pursue the Article 5 claim in the arbitral proceedings cannot be regarded as intrinsically incompatible with the representation that the Bratislava proceedings were intended only as a safeguard. The Claimant still faced the possibility that the Tribunal might uphold one of the new jurisdictional objections and thus put an end to the entire arbitration.\n\n254.\n\nMore problematic, however, is the overall pattern of conduct displayed by the Claimant in the period under consideration. Although it initially informed the Court, in its Petition commencing proceedings, that it had brought the same claim for violation of the BIT in the arbitration and that it regarded the arbitration as the primary forum for the determination of that claim, taken as a whole its later conduct cannot he reconciled with that stance. The first sign that the Claimant might be going beyond the stance taken in the Petition was its decision, in August 2011, to take the initiative of submitting a request to the Bratislava Court asking it to reconsider its earlier decision to grant the Respondent an extension of time. While the Claimant did refer to the arbitration, it did not fully disclose what was then taking place in the arbitral proceedings. Moreover, its opposition to a request for an extension of time, when the Claimant had itself applied for a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration, casts doubt on its earlier assurance that it did not wish to pursue the Bratislava action until the outcome of the arbitration was known.\n\n255.\n\nMore importantly, the Claimant has filed submissions in the Bratislava proceedings in which it has requested a judgment on the merits (in its response of 16 July 2012 to the Respondent\u2019s defence - paragraph 243, above - and its filing of 8 August 2012). While the Claimant has contended that the request at the end of its filings of 16 July 2012 and 8 August 2012 should not be regarded as a \"prayer for relief\u2019, what is inescapable is that both documents concluded with a request that the Bratislava Court give judgment on the merits for the Claimant, notwithstanding that the Tribunal had not yet ruled on the original jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal does not see how that request can be reconciled with the Claimant\u2019s original position that the arbitration was the primary forum for determination of the BIT claims and that proceedings had been commenced in the Bratislava Court only as a safeguard against a claim being statute-barred in the event that the Tribunal were to find that it had no jurisdiction and leave the Claimant with the national courts as its only avenue of redress.\n\n256.\n\nWe come then to the Claimant\u2019s conduct after the Tribunal had given its Award of 22 October 2012. The effect of that First Award has already been explained.340 The position in which it put the Claimant was that the Articles 2 and 4 claims could thenceforth be pursued only in the Bratislava Court, whereas the Article 5 claim *might* be capable of being pursued in the arbitration but only if the new jurisdictional objections were dismissed. The Tribunal appreciates that this decision placed the Claimant in a difficult position. It could still not be certain that the Tribunal would uphold jurisdiction over the Article 5 claim. Moreover, while the Article 5 claim is free-standing in that it is not dependent upon the success or failure of claims under Articles 2 or 4, it is difficult to see how the Claimant could recover damages for breach of Article 5 in addition to any damages or compensation it might be awarded for breach of Article 2 or Article 4. Both in the arbitration and in the Bratislava proceedings, the Claimant has sought a total of 131,400,000 euros in compensation/damages without attempting to apportion this total sum between the different provisions under which it has brought its claim. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the *Achmea* tribunal, while finding that there was a breach of the provision equivalent to Article 5, considered that \"the violation and the injury arising from the temporary adoption of the ban on profits are subsumed within the violation and injury arising from the breach of the \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 obligations\" and concluded that \"it is not necessary to consider the question of losses arising from that breach any further\".341 While that award was not given until six weeks after the 22 October 2012 Award in the present proceedings, it is likely that the Claimant was aware that it might face difficulties in seeking to recover damages for alleged violations of Articles 2 and 4 in the Bratislava Court while simultaneously pursuing a claim - in respect of the same facts - under Article 5 before the Tribunal.\n\nBoth Parties have alluded to the possibility of a challenge to the First Award but, so far as the Tribunal is aware, have taken no steps to initiate such a challenge. In the circumstances, the Tribunal must proceed on the basis that the First Award stands and is binding on both Parties.\n\n*Achmea* v. *Slovak Republic, supra* note 150, para. 286.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal has some sympathy for the Claimant's predicament but it considers that if the Claimant were to pursue claims in both the Bratislava Court and the arbitration, it was essential that it made clear the relationship between the steps taken in the former proceedings and the position in the arbitration if those steps were not to be considered a waiver. The legal position having changed since the Petition was filed, it was incumbent upon the Claimant - if it wished to maintain both sets of proceedings - to update the reference in the Petition to the relationship between the two and to ensure that the national court action was still no more than a safeguarding measure to the extent that the two sets of proceedings still overlapped.\n\n258.\n\nThe course which the Claimant actually followed was very different. First, as the Claimant conceded at the September 2013 hearing before the Tribunal, at no time did it inform the Bratislava Court or the Court of Appeal of the Award of 22 October 2012.342 The Tribunal has to say that it finds this omission quite extraordinary. The Claimant had filed its Petition avowedly to guard against the possibility of the Tribunal finding that it lacked jurisdiction; it had assured the Court and the Respondent that it regarded the Tribunal as the primary forum for the resolution of the BIT dispute and it had made a request for a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration (a request on which the Court had not ruled by the time the Award was delivered). In the summer of 2011, it had taken the opportunity of a submission on a different matter to draw the Court\u2019s attention to what was then the expected timetable for the arbitration (see paragraph 241, above). Yet when it received the Award which dealt with most of the jurisdictional issues in the arbitration, it made no mention of that fact to the Bratislava Court.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional hearing. Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 183.\n\n259.\n\nOn the contrary, the Claimant took several active steps in the Bratislava proceedings after it had received the Award without saying anything about the Award. Thus, on 16 November 2012, it responded to the District Court\u2019s request for clarification of whether it was still seeking a stay under Section 109(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure. While the letter from the District Court - perhaps surprisingly - did not refer to the Claimant's other request, under Section 109(2)(c) for a stay pending the outcome of the arbitration (the request that is relevant for present purposes), the Claimant did not take the opportunity, in responding to the request from the Court, either to inform the Court of the changed position brought about by the Award or to remind the Court of its other outstanding request for a stay. In response to a question about that at the September 2013 hearing before the Tribunal, counsel for the Claimant replied that:\n\nAll I can say here, not being a Slovak lawyer, that\u2019s just not the practice, that\u2019s just not the way it's done in Slovak litigation. That's the only explanation I can give you. 1 mean, when I say it\u2019s not done in Slovak litigation, or that\u2019s not the practice, I mean, to come back to the court and say \"Please decide on the other application as well.\"343\n\nHowever, counsel offered no explanation as to which provision of Slovak law might preclude a party from volunteering relevant information to the court, nor is any such impediment mentioned by the Claimant\u2019s Slovak law expert, Dr Br\u00f4stl. Moreover, the Claimant had shown no hesitation in volunteering information regarding the arbitration proceedings in earlier submissions to the Bratislava Court.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional hearing, Transcript (16 September 2013), p. 190.\n\n260.\n\nOn 14 January 2013, after the District Court had given its judgment on the Section 109(1)(b) request for a stay but before it lodged its appeal against that judgment, the Claimant requested an order for the disclosure of the *Achmea* award on the ground that it might be relevant evidence in the proceedings. However, that award could be relevant evidence only in relation to the merits of the Claimant\u2019s BIT claim. In seeking that evidence, the Claimant did not mention either the Award or its, still unanswered, request for a stay under Section 109(2)(c). The same was true of the Claimant's appeal on 31 January 2013 and its response, on 3 April 2013, to the Respondent\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the District Court.\n\n261.\n\nTaking these various steps as a whole, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant\u2019s conduct of the Bratislava litigation went well beyond what could reasonably be regarded, to borrow Mr. Runeland\u2019s expression, as \"what was necessary to keep it alive as a precautionary measure\". In none of the Claimant\u2019s communications with the Court after the summer of 2011 was the precautionary element so much as mentioned. The Claimant took no steps to progress its application for a stay pending the outcome of the arbitration and, even more significantly, never informed the Court of what the Tribunal had decided regarding jurisdiction in its Award of 22 October 2012, thus leaving before the Court a record that was incomplete and, in certain respects, actually misleading. Even if the Claimant was not in a position to take the initiative and call upon the Court to address its Section 109(2)(c) request for a stay, there was nothing to prevent it from informing the Court of the developments in the arbitration and every reason to expect that it would, and should, do so. Its failure is all the more extraordinary since it referred to the proceedings in *Eureko/Achmea* before the Court and the Court of Appeal but not to the proceedings in the arbitration to which it was itself a party.\n\n262.\n\nIt is true that the Respondent also made no mention of the Award in its communications with the Bratislava Court and the Court of Appeal. However, the request for a stay was the Claimant\u2019s request, the earlier information about the arbitration had been given by the Claimant and it is the Claimant whose conduct of the litigation which it had initiated has to be reconciled with the arbitration claim it is pursuing in such a way as to ensure that it is not seen as a waiver.\n\n263.\n\nIt must also be pointed out that, at the hearing before the Tribunal in September 2013, counsel for the Claimant stated that the Claimant\u2019s application for a stay of proceedings under Section 109(2)(c) pending the outcome of the arbitration is still outstanding and that the Claimant still wishes to obtain such a stay.344 However, the Claimant has taken active steps in the proceedings without any reference to that application.\n\nSecond Jurisdictional hearing. Transcript (16 September 2013), pp. 187-188.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, after the Award of October 2012 was delivered, the procedural steps taken by the Claimant in the Slovak courts, discussed in the preceding paragraphs, went beyond what was necessary to protect the Claimant\u2019s position pending the outcome of the challenges to the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Tribunal. Even though the Tribunal accepts that the Slovak litigation was originally commenced as a precautionary measure, the Claimant\u2019s subsequent conduct of the litigation in the Slovak courts was such that a reasonable person would have concluded that it was no longer treating that litigation as a mere safeguard but was actively pursuing it with a view to obtaining a judgment in its favour irrespective of whatever might happen in the arbitration. On the basis of the evidence of Swedish law put before it by the Parties and considered above, the Tribunal concludes that this conduct amounts to a waiver of the right to arbitrate. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it is without jurisdiction in respect of the claim under Article 5, which is the only claim outstanding after the Award of 22 October 2012.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal adds two comments for the avoidance of doubt. First, it has reached the conclusion set out above on the basis of the Claimant\u2019s conduct taken as a whole and not on the basis that any one incident is decisive in and of itself. Secondly, while the Tribunal is not persuaded that there was no course open to the Claimant by which it could have sought to advance a ruling on its request for a stay under Section 109(2)(c), its decision does not rest upon the Claimant's failure to take such action. Even if the Tribunal had found that there was indeed no means under Slovak law by which the Claimant could have pressed the District Court for a ruling on that request for a stay, the Tribunal would still have concluded that the active steps that were taken by the Claimant, together with the Claimant's failure to inform the Court of the changed circumstances in the arbitration justified the conclusion which the Tribunal has reached.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n266.\n\nIn paragraph 459 of the First Award, the Tribunal reserved the question of costs for the next phase of the proceedings. Article 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules provides in relevant part;\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal considerable discretion regarding costs. In exercising that discretion, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to take account of the following considerations:\n\n(a) the Respondent has been successful in the second phase of the proceedings, with the result that there is no jurisdiction over any part of the claim;\n\n(b) the Respondent was successful in the first phase of the proceedings in establishing that there was no jurisdiction regarding the claim under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT;\n\n(c) the Claimant was successful in the first phase of the proceedings in defeating the Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection (incompatibility of the BIT with EU law) and second jurisdictional objection (indirect investment).\n\nBefore taking a decision, however, the Tribunal wishes to receive details of the costs of legal representation and assistance borne by each Party and to receive brief submissions from each Party regarding the apportionment of costs. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(a) each Party shall submit a detailed statement of the costs it has incurred, stated separately for each of the two phases of the proceedings, together with submissions of not more than five typed pages, not later than 27 June 2014;\n\n(b) each Party shall submit a response of not more than five typed pages to the other Party\u2019s filing under sub-paragraph (a), above, not later than 4 July.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal upholds the Respondent\u2019s objection that the Claimant, by its conduct in relation to the proceedings which it instituted before the Bratislava District Court I, has waived its right to arbitrate, with the result that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claim under Article 5. Costs will be dealt with in a subsequent award as specified in paragraph 266 above.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| PCA Case No. 2010-17 **AGREED CHRONOLOGY (Sect. 6 of Procedural Order No. 6)** |\n| Nr. | DATE |

Costs\n--------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. PARTIES**\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this arbitration is the European American Investment Bank Aktiengesellschaft (the \"Claimant\" or \"Euram Bank\"), a company established under the laws of Austria with its registered office at Palais Esterh\u00e1zy, Wallnerstrasse 4, 1010 Vienna, Austria. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nDr. Erhard Bohm, Specht Bohm Rechtsanwalt GmbH\n\nMr. Stanislav Durica, Ruzicka Csekes.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent in this arbitration is the Slovak Republic (the \"Respondent\" or the \"Slovak Republic\" or \"Slovakia\"). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nMs. Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\nMr. Mark A. Clodfelter, Foley Hoag LLP\n\nMr. David A. Pawlak, David A Pawlak LLC\n\nMr. Constantinos Salonidis, Foley Hoag LLP\n\nMs. Diana Tsutieva, Foley Hoag LLP.\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 23 November 2009, Euram Bank commenced arbitration proceedings against the Slovak Republic, pursuant to Article 8(2) of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated 15 October 1990 (the \"BIT\") and Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 15 December 1976 (\"UNCITRAL Rules\").\n\n4.\n\nThe procedural history of the case is set out in detail in the Tribunal's First Award on Jurisdiction of 22 October 2012 (the \"First Award\") and Second Award on Jurisdiction of 4 June 2014 (the \"Second Award\"). Only those aspects relevant to the Tribunal's decision on costs are repeated here.\n\n5.\n\nIn its Statement of Claim, Euram Bank claimed that changes in the law on health insurance in the Slovak Republic, adopted in 2007 and entering into force in 2008, had destroyed the value of its investment in a health insurance company called Chemick\u00e1 zdravotn\u00e1 poist'ov\u00f1a Apollo (\"Apollo\"). Euram Bank maintained that this action amounted to expropriation (within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT), as well as to a violation of the requirement of fair and equitable treatment in Article 2 of the BIT and of the provisions of Article 5 of the BIT regarding transfers. The factual background and the claim are set out in detail in the First Award.\n\n6.\n\nOn 5 November 2010, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence, which raised four objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal:\n\n*i.* that the arbitration provision of the BIT was no longer valid because Austria and the Slovak Republic were both Member States of the European Union (the \"intra-EU BIT objection\");\n\n*ii.* that Euram Bank's claims did not arise out of a qualifying investment (the \"indirect investment objection\");\n\n*iii.* that the claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT fell outside the scope of the arbitration provision contained in Article 8 of the BIT (the \"Article 8 objection\"); and\n\n*iv.* that the claims for alleged breach of Article 2 of the BIT did not comply with the prior notice requirement under the BIT (the \"procedural objection\").\n\nThese objections are described in greater detail in paragraph 48 of the First Award.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal ordered bifurcation of the proceedings, and a hearing on the Respondent's jurisdictional objections was held on 19 and 20 December 2011 (\"Phase 1\"). While the Tribunal was considering its decision on the jurisdictional objections, the Respondent submitted, on 26 May 2012, a Supplementary Statement of Defence in which it raised further jurisdictional objections arising out of proceedings instituted by the Claimant in the District Court of Bratislava I:\n\n*i.* that, by the Claimant's act of commencing proceedings in the District Court of Bratislava I and the Respondent's filing of its substantive defence in that case, the Parties had constructively agreed to terminate the arbitration and submit their dispute to the jurisdiction of the Slovak courts (the \"constructive agreement objection\");\n\n*ii.* that the filing of the Petition to Commence Proceedings in the District Court constituted a waiver of the right to arbitrate (the \"first waiver objection\"); and\n\n*iii.* that the Claimant's conduct in the litigation before the Slovak courts, taken as a whole, constituted a waiver of the right to arbitrate (the \"second waiver objection\").\n\nThese objections are described in greater detail in paragraphs 87-89 of the Second Award.\n\n8.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, the Tribunal issued the First Award, in which it dismissed the intra-EU BIT objection and the indirect investment objection, but accepted the Article 8 objection and therefore concluded that \"it lack[ed] jurisdiction over all aspects of the Claimant's claim other than the claim under Article 5 of the BIT.\"1 The Tribunal also held that it was unnecessary to pronounce on the procedural objection and \"reserve[d] the question of costs to the next phase of the proceedings.\"2\n\nFirst Award, para. 460(5).\n\nFirst Award, para. 459.\n\n9.\n\nOn 4 June 2014, following a second jurisdictional phase including a second hearing on jurisdiction held on September 16, 2013 (\"Phase 2\"), the Tribunal issued the Second Award, in which it dismissed the constructive agreement objection and the first waiver objection, but accepted the second waiver objection \"with the result that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claim under Article 5.\"3\n\nSecond Award, para. 267.\n\n10.\n\nSection V of the Second Award addressed the issue of costs as follows:\n\nIn paragraph 459 of the First Award, the Tribunal reserved the question of costs for the next phase of the proceedings. Article 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules provides in relevant part:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal considerable discretion regarding costs. In exercising that discretion, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to take account of the following considerations:\n\n(a) the Respondent has been successful in the second phase of the proceedings, with the result that there is no jurisdiction over any part of the claim;\n\n(b) the Respondent was successful in the first phase of the proceedings in establishing that there was no jurisdiction regarding the claim under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT;\n\n(c) the Claimant was successful in the first phase of the proceedings in defeating the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection (incompatibility of the BIT with EU law) and second jurisdictional objection (indirect investment).\n\nBefore taking a decision, however, the Tribunal wishes to receive details of the costs of legal representation and assistance borne by each Party and to receive brief submissions from each Party regarding the apportionment of costs. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(a) each Party shall submit a detailed statement of the costs it has incurred, stated separately for each of the two phases of the proceedings, together with submissions of not more than five typed pages, not later than 27 June 2014;\n\n(b) each Party shall submit a response of not more than five typed pages to the other Party's filing under sub-paragraph (a), above, not later than 4 July.\n\n11.\n\nBy correspondence of 12 June 2014 and 13 June 2014, the Parties agreed and the Tribunal confirmed new deadlines for the Parties' costs submissions, namely, 11 July 2014 for the Parties' submissions on costs and 18 July 2014 for the Parties' responses on costs.\n\n12.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, the Parties exchanged their respective submissions on costs (\"Claimant's Submission on Costs\" and \"Respondent's Submission on Costs\").\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 July 2014, the Parties exchanged their respective response submissions on costs (\"Claimant's Response on Costs\" and \"Respondent's Response on Costs\").\n\n14.\n\nThe sole purpose of this Award is to decide on the allocation of costs.\n\n**II. COSTS INCURRED**\n----------------------\n\n**A. THE COSTS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nIn Phase 1, the Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR 850,000.00 (EUR 425,000.00 each) to cover the costs of arbitration. In addition, the Claimant paid a further EUR 3,000 in appointing authority fees to the PCA for the first challenge to Professor Stern and the appointment of the presiding arbitrator (the fee for the second challenge to Professor Stern being paid from the Claimant's share of the deposit).\n\n16.\n\nThe costs of arbitration disbursed by the PCA for Phase 1 break down as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Fees |\n| Sir Christopher Greenwood | EUR 173,750.00 |\n| Dr. Dr. Alexander Petsche | EUR 223,500.00 |\n| Professor Brigitte Stern | EUR 203,250.00, plus EUR 39,837.00 VAT |\n| Expenses |\n| Court reporting | EUR 8,718.48 |\n| Hearing expenses (incl. catering, AV, IT, etc.) | EUR 12,483.60 |\n| Other expenses (incl. travel, courier, telecommunications, office supplies, bank charges, etc.) | EUR 19,988.78 |\n| PCA |\n| Registry fees | EUR 100,105.00 |\n| Appointing authority fees | EUR 4,500.00 |\n| TOTAL | EUR 786,132.86 |\n\n17.\n\nIn Phase 2, the Parties deposited with the PCA an additional EUR 200,000.00 (EUR 100,000.00 each) to cover the costs of arbitration.\n\n18.\n\nThe costs of arbitration disbursed by the PCA for Phase 2 (including work on this Award on Costs) break down as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Fees |\n| Sir Christopher Greenwood | EUR 53,000.00 |\n| Dr. Dr. Alexander Petsche | EUR 70,500.00 |\n| Professor Brigitte Stern | EUR 48,000.00 plus EUR 9,480.00 VAT |\n| Expenses |\n| Court reporting | EUR 4,352.15 |\n| Hearing expenses (incl. catering, AV, IT, etc.) | EUR 5,874.70 |\n| Other expenses (incl. travel, courier, telecommunications, office supplies, bank charges, etc.) | EUR 5,201.44 |\n| PCA |\n| Registry fees | EUR 49,420.00 |\n| TOTAL | EUR 245,828.29 |\n\n19.\n\nThe total costs of the arbitration disbursed by the PCA therefore amount to EUR 1,031,961.15. These costs include all those costs detailed in Article 38(a), (b), and (f) of the UNCITRAL Rules. There were no costs incurred under Article 38(d), as no witnesses attended either hearing.\n\n**B. THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE PARTIES**\n----------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nA summary of the costs claimed by the Parties for Phase 1 is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Claimant4** | **Respondent5** |\n| Experts | EUR 108,480.00 | EUR 16,084.52 |\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, Section I(F).\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 10.\n\n21.\n\nA summary of the costs claimed by the Parties for Phase 2 is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Legal fees (incl. VAT) and expenses (incl. translation, office, courier, and travel expenses) | EUR 1,107,419.926 | EUR 3,061,324.117 |\n|  | **Total** | **EUR 1,215,899.92** | **EUR 3,077,408.63** |\n|  |\n|  |  | **Claimant8** | **Respondent9** |\n|  | Experts | EUR 68,735.32 | EUR 41,220.00 |\n|  | Legal fees (incl.

THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. APPLICABLE RULES AND PRACTICE**\n------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant***\n---------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, while Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes a presumption that the unsuccessful party should bear the costs of the arbitration, it nevertheless authorizes the Tribunal to apportion costs as it deems reasonable under the circumstances of the case.12 By contrast, Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules contains no presumption and grants the Tribunal total discretion to apportion the costs of legal representation and assistance as it deems reasonable.13 The Claimant argues that, \"ultimately, whether an apportionment is reasonable is a subjective inquiry\", but that certain criteria can be derived from practice, including (i) the parties' degree of success on their claims and defences; (ii) the parties' conduct during the arbitral proceedings; (iii) the nature of the parties to the dispute; and (iv) the nature of the dispute resolution mechanism.14 In particular, the Claimant points to what it describes as \"[t]he prevailing view on costs apportionment in investment treaty arbitration [\u2026] namely that parties to such proceedings shall in principle divide the costs of the arbitral tribunal evenly and bear their own costs of representation, save in cases of frivolous or bad faith claims.\"15 The Claimant adds that, to the extent that the Tribunal chooses to deviate from this rule, \"[a]n apportionment of costs in proportion to a party's level of success is particularly appropriate in cases in which success is split,\" and that \"[i]n the absence of claims expressed in money, the amount of work done and time spent, as reflected in the Parties' submissions, in the hearing time devoted to the objections, and the Tribunal's time spent in deciding on them, may serve as an adequate surrogate and indicator of the importance and value of an objection.\"16\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 6.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 7.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 8.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 24; Claimant's Response on Costs, para. 1, citing D.

The Republic of Argentina*, UNCITRAL/PCA Case No. 20109, Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 340, 342.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 10-11.\n\n***2. The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent submits that only exceptional circumstances \u2013 which it alleges are not present in this case \u2013 can justify the derogation from what it describes as the \"costs follow the event\" rule for arbitration costs as established by Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.17 In addition, despite the absence of any presumption as to the allocation of the costs of legal representation under Article 40(2), the Respondent argues that \"investment treaty-based UNCITRAL tribunals have consistently held that the prime factor in determining how *both* categories of costs shall be reasonably apportioned is the *same*, namely *success in the proceedings* \",18 and that success should be measured in accordance with \"the impact of the Tribunal's decision on the independent components of Claimant's overall case.\"19 The Respondent adds that UNCITRAL tribunals have also taken a party's improper conduct during the proceedings, including the initiation of similar parallel proceedings, into account when allocating the costs of legal representation between the parties.20\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, para. 4, referring to *Canfor Corp. v. USA, Tembec et al. v. USA, and Terminal Forest Prods. Ltd. v. USA*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Joint Order on Costs and Termination, 19 July 2007, \u00b6 139; *Achmea B.V. (formerly Eureko B.V.) v.

APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS FOR PHASE 1**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant***\n---------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant notes that it was successful in defeating the intra-EU BIT objection and the indirect investment objection. Since a preponderance of the Respondent's written and oral submissions and some 64% of the First Award was devoted to these objections, the Claimant submits that it had a 60% success rate in Phase 1.21 Moreover, the Claimant argues that the Respondent raised these objections in disregard of \"a clear line of adverse jurisprudence known to the Respondent\".22\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 13. The Claimant states that this translates into a 20% compensation rate. *See id.* n. 7 (\"Mathematically: compensation rate = success rate (60) x 2 (120) \u2013 100 = 20\").\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 14, referring, in respect of the intra-EU BIT objection, to *Binder v. Czech Republic*, *Easter Sugar v. Czech Republic*, and *Eureko v. Slovak Republic*, all of which had previously rejected similar objections.\n\n25.\n\nAs regards the Respondent's successful Article 8 objection, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent's \"success did not come easy\" given the complex questions of Slovak law and treaty interpretation involved.23 The Claimant's unsuccessful argument based on the MFN provision also \"concerned unsettled matters of international law,\" which other tribunals have found to be sufficient grounds to decline to award costs against the unsuccessful party.24 The above-mentioned factors, the Claimant submits, justify that it be awarded no less than 30% of its costs in Phase 1.25 The Claimant adds that its unsuccessful challenges to Professor Stern were made in good faith and, in any case, involved a negligible amount of the Parties' overall time and costs.26\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 16.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 17; Claimant's Response on Costs, para. 12, noting that the decision in *Austrian Airlines v.

The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it should be considered substantially successful in Phase 1, since its Article 8 objection effectively defeated the claims raised under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT, leaving only a tentative claim under Article 5 that was subject to further jurisdictional objections in Phase 2.29 The Respondent also notes that it defeated the two challenges to Professor Stern.30\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, p. 2; Respondent's Response on Costs, paras. 8-9, referring to Second Award on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 252.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, p. 2.\n\n28.\n\nAs regards the jurisdictional objections on which the Claimant prevailed (namely, the intra-EU BIT objection and the indirect investment objection), the Respondent notes that the Tribunal itself recognized that previous awards had failed to grapple with important aspects of the intra-EU BIT objection, and argues that the indirect investment objection was reasonable on the basis of the precedent in *HICEE v. Slovak Republic*.31 Moreover, these objections could be no more unreasonable than the Claimant\u2019s arguments on the Article 8 objection in spite of the decision in *Austrian Airlines v.

The \"submissions on each issue [were] considerable in both quality and volume; and the detail and rigour of the second Award on Jurisdiction evidence enough that Claimant was not fighting a battle it was bound to lose right [from] the outset.\"34 Moreover, the Tribunal dismissed two of the Respondent\u2019s three alternative formulations of its objections in this phase, including the constructive agreement objection and the first waiver objection.35\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission on Costs, paras. 20-22.\n\n31.\n\nAs regards the conduct criticized by the Respondent, the Claimant submits that its request for a full translation of Swedish court decisions was justified, and notes that the Respondent had never itself pleaded that the Claimant should have informed the Bratislava court of the First Award.36 With respect to its objection to the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, the Claimant asserts that it is the Respondent who should be faulted for having submitted a Rejoinder that exceeded the bounds of what could reasonably have been expected at that stage of the proceedings. According to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s actions in this regard violated the Claimant\u2019s due process rights, led the Tribunal to dismiss a section of it of its own initiative, and necessitated the postponement of the second hearing on jurisdiction.37\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 23; Claimant\u2019s Response on Costs, paras. 16-17.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response on Costs, para. 18. referring to Procedural Order No. 6, 30 May 2013.\n\n***2.

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. APPLICABLE RULES AND PRACTICE**\n------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nArticle 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award\" and defines the \"costs of arbitration\" as follows:\n\nThe term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n39.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules then sets forth the relevant rules as to the allocation of costs. Article 40 provides in relevant part:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n40.\n\nAs already noted by the Tribunal in its Second Award, Article 40 gives the Tribunal considerable discretion regarding costs. There is, however, a clear distinction between the first and second paragraphs of Article 40. The former lays down a general principle that the unsuccessful party should bear the entirety of the costs to which that paragraph applies (i.e. all the costs listed in Article 38 except for the costs of legal assistance and representation of the parties under Article 38(e)). A tribunal may depart from that principle if, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, it considers it reasonable to do so, but the starting point is an assumption that \"costs follow the event\". By contrast, the second paragraph of Article 40, which applies to the costs of legal assistance and representation, contains no general principle to serve as a starting point. The Tribunal does not accept that it should approach the question of apportionment of costs under the second paragraph on the basis that costs should follow the event unless there is a compelling reason to decide otherwise, for that would be to assimilate the second paragraph to the first in spite of the clear difference in language. Nor can the Tribunal accept that it should approach an application for apportionment of costs under the second paragraph on the basis that each party should normally be expected to bear its own costs unless there is a compelling reason to decide otherwise. That would be to read into the second paragraph a presumption that is not there; had it been the intention of those who drafted Article 40 to apply such a presumption, the drafting of the first paragraph strongly suggests that they would have included express language to that effect.\n\n41.\n\nNevertheless, while the starting point for the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is different under the two paragraphs of Article 40, the factors which the Tribunal must take into account in the exercise of that discretion are very similar. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the parties' relative degree of success is the principal consideration. This arises from the basic principle that the successful party \"has in effect been forced to go through the process in order to achieve success, and should not be penalised by having to pay for the process itself.\"49\n\n*SD Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Final Award on Costs, 30 December 2002, \u00b6 15.\n\n42.\n\nAs stated in the Second Award, the Tribunal regards as relevant both the overall result as well as each Party's success in respect of discrete aspects of its case. The party who is successful overall should in principle be made whole, but not necessarily in respect of independent claims, jurisdictional objections, or procedural applications, on which it was not successful and which have contributed to the overall costs of the arbitration in a significant and measurable way. The latter principle is especially appropriate in the apportionment of the cost of legal representation and assistance. Consequently, the Tribunal is inclined to look primarily at the overall result when allocating the costs of arbitration in accordance with Article 40(1), but to look more closely also at the Parties' respective success on the various claims, jurisdictional objections, and procedural applications that materially impacted upon the Parties' legal costs when apportioning these under Article 40(2). The Tribunal considers that this difference in approach under the two paragraphs of Article 40 follows from the difference between the starting point under each paragraph.\n\n43.\n\nSuccess is not, however, the only relevant criterion. The conduct of each party is a material consideration, particularly where it has led to costs being unnecessarily incurred. Thus, if a party advanced a claim (or a jurisdictional objection) that was manifestly untenable or frivolous, that would be a highly pertinent consideration. Time-wasting tactics, failure to meet deadlines, and other procedural misconduct are also relevant.\n\n44.\n\nMoreover, unlike those costs governed by the first paragraph of Article 40, the costs of each party's legal assistance and representation are determined by the choices made by that party and are not controlled by the tribunal. Article 38(e) thus makes clear that the costs of legal assistance and representation constitute costs of the arbitration \"only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the *amount* of such costs is reasonable\" (emphasis added).\n\n**B. ARTICLE 40(1): COSTS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe costs of the Tribunal are set out at paragraphs 15-19, above.\n\n46.\n\nThe outcome of the Respondent's jurisdictional challenges is that the Respondent has succeeded in establishing that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over any part of the Claimant's claims. The starting point under Article 40(1) is, therefore, the principle that the Claimant, as the unsuccessful party, should bear the costs covered by this provision. The question is whether, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, it would be reasonable to depart from that general principle.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Claimant's arguments that departure from the general principle is warranted, but it is not persuaded by them. It is true that the first phase of the proceedings resulted in a decision that rejected the Respondent's first two jurisdictional objections and upheld \u2013 albeit subject to the outcome of the (ultimately successful) additional challenge \u2013 jurisdiction in respect of the Article 5 claim. However, as stated in paragraph 42, above, it is the overall success of a party which is the principal consideration under Article 40(1) and the Respondent has achieved that overall success. Moreover, even if one considers the two phases of the proceedings separately, the Respondent must be considered to have emerged more successfully from the first phase than did the Claimant. The argument on which it succeeded in the first phase established that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT. Those claims had occupied a far more prominent position in the Claimant's case than had the only claim which survived the first phase. In the second phase, the Respondent was entirely successful.\n\n48.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider that the Respondent can be faulted for having brought the first two jurisdictional objections. Neither objection can properly be characterized as frivolous. Although unsuccessful, neither fell into the category of an objection so untenable that it was obviously doomed to fail.\n\n49.\n\nAs for the Respondent's procedural conduct, while the Tribunal held in the Second Award that the Respondent was guilty of undue delay in raising one aspect of its waiver objection, that did not affect the overall outcome of the case and, in any event, has to be considered in the context of a number of criticisms which the Tribunal made of the Claimant's conduct of the proceedings.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimant should bear the entire costs incurred by the Tribunal. Those costs amounted to EUR 1,031,961.15 as set out in paragraph 19, above. The Parties' deposits amounted to EUR 1,050,000 (in equal shares) and the Claimant paid an additional EUR 3000 in appointing authority fees directly to the PCA, leaving an unexpended balance of EUR 21,038.85. That balance will be returned in equal shares (EUR 10,519.43) to each Party.50 The Claimant is, therefore, required to reimburse the Respondent EUR 514,480.58 for the costs met from the Respondent's share of the deposit.\n\nD. Caron & L. Caplan, THE UNCITRAL RULES: A COMMENTARY, 2ND ED. (2013), p. 900 (\"The unexpended portions of these deposits, when no longer required, must be returned to the parties in amounts proportional to the relative percentage of contribution\").\n\n51.\n\nArticle 40(1) is also applicable to costs under Article 38(c), namely \"the costs of expert advice and assistance required by the arbitral tribunal\". This heading includes the costs of experts retained by the parties. The Tribunal considers that the costs of the experts retained by the Parties were reasonable and that the expert reports were of assistance. It follows that these costs fall within Article 38(c) and, in accordance with the principle set out above, the Claimant should reimburse the Respondent for the costs of the experts for whom the Respondent paid. The total costs of experts paid by the Respondent amount to EUR 57,304.52.\n\n52.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes, in the exercise of its powers under Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, that the Claimant shall reimburse the Respondent EUR 571,785.10.\n\n**C. ARTICLE 40(2): COSTS OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND REPRESENTATION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nTurning to the costs of legal representation and assistance incurred by each Party, the Tribunal begins by recalling that its powers under Article 40(2) are not constrained by the same general principle which applies under Article 40(1). While the overall success of the Respondent in its jurisdictional objections is certainly a relevant factor, that overall result is considerably tempered by the mixed success of the Parties on the various jurisdictional objections raised during the first phase of the proceedings. The Tribunal does not believe that any of the arguments put forward by either side were unreasonable. However, the Respondent's two unsuccessful objections, and in particular the intra-EU BIT objection, occupied a very considerable portion of the Parties' written and oral submissions. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's argument that it had a preponderance of success in the first phase of the proceedings. While it succeeded on two of the jurisdictional objections, it failed on the third and, as a result, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was reduced to its Article 5 claim. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers it right to take into account the amount of time and, correspondingly of costs, taken up by the intra-EU BIT objection and the indirect investment objection in the first phase of the proceedings.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent's success in the second phase was also tempered by the fact that it failed on two of the three arguments that it advanced, although this mixed result is less significant than that in the first phase of the proceedings, as the waiver arguments were not entirely separate from one another in the way that the intra-EU BIT objection was separate from the other objections considered in the first phase.\n\n55.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers that it would be reasonable for the Claimant to meet part, but certainly not all, of the Respondent's costs of legal assistance and representation.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered whether the conduct of the Parties was such as to affect the amount which the Claimant should pay to the Respondent but has concluded that the misconduct of which each Party accused the other was not sufficient, where it was established, to make a significant difference for the purpose of apportionment of costs.\n\n57.\n\nThe most serious issue in this respect is the lack of candour shown by the Claimant in relation to its decision to pursue proceedings in the Bratislava Court at the same time that it was pursuing its arbitration claim. The Claimant instituted those proceedings on 22 November 2010, a little more than two weeks after the Respondent had filed its Statement of Defence and Request for Bifurcation, at a time when the Tribunal was still considering that request (the Claimant having sought an extension of time to respond to it). As the Tribunal made clear (in paragraph 119 of the Second Award), had the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent that it had commenced proceedings in the Bratislava Court, it would have made it possible for the Respondent to amend its Statement of Defence and to raise the commencement of those proceedings as an additional jurisdictional objection. However, the Second Award makes clear that the Respondent's objection based on the proceedings in the Bratislava Court succeeded because the Claimant's subsequent conduct of the litigation in Bratislava amounted to a waiver of its right to arbitrate. It cannot, therefore, be said that the Claimant's failure to inform the Tribunal in November 2010 that it had commenced proceedings in the Bratislava Court ultimately increased legal costs. Similarly, although the Claimant's failure to keep the Bratislava Court informed of developments in the arbitration formed part of the context that led the Tribunal to accept the Respondent's second waiver objection, it did not increase the costs of Phase 2.\n\n58.\n\nThere is no reason to hold the Claimant responsible for the increased procedural costs arising from the invitation to Austria, the Czech Republic, and the European Commission to make *amicus curiae* submissions to the Tribunal. While such invitation was prompted by a request from the Claimant, the Tribunal invited these submissions on the basis that they would usefully contribute to the Tribunal's own analysis of the intra-EU BIT objection. Moreover, the Claimant had only requested that Austria be invited to make an *amicus curiae* submission. It was the Respondent's (albeit subsidiary) request that the European Commission and the Czech Republic also be invited to make *amicus curiae* submissions.\n\n59.\n\nWhile it is true that, in the second phase of the proceedings, the Respondent submitted a Rejoinder that exceeded the bounds of what could reasonably have been expected at that stage and thus caused the postponement of the second hearing on jurisdiction,51 the Claimant thereafter submitted a Rebuttal that also exceeded the scope allowed by the Tribunal.52 In addition, full translations of Swedish legal authorities were explicitly requested \"[i]n order for the Tribunal to be able to assess for itself the cases that are cited by the Parties' experts on Swedish law\" and not only for the Parties' benefit.53 The allegations regarding the translations are thus irrelevant to the issue of apportionment of costs.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6, 30 May 2013\n\nProcedural Order No. 9, 20 August 2013.\n\nProcedural Order No. 7, 11 June 2013.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, it should direct the Claimant to reimburse the Respondent for a portion of its costs of legal assistance and representation such as will reflect both the overall success of the Respondent and its failure on some important and time-consuming jurisdictional objections.\n\n61.\n\nIn determining what amount would be reasonable, the Tribunal is compelled, however, to observe that the amounts claimed by the Respondent are far in excess of those costs incurred by the Claimant. While acknowledging the various legitimate reasons that one party's costs may differ from another's, the magnitude of the difference is impossible to ignore in this case. Of particular importance, since it was in this phase that the Respondent achieved the more complete success, the disparity is most marked in respect of the second phase of the proceedings. The Respondent's net legal fees for Phase 2 are more than seven times those of the Claimant. Moreover, the Respondent's costs for legal representation in Phase 2 are approximately two thirds of what it claims in respect of Phase 1. By contrast, the Claimant's costs in Phase 2 are less than one third of those incurred in Phase 1. The Tribunal's costs in Phase 2 are also less than one third of those incurred in Phase 1.\n\n62.\n\nThe issues in the second phase of the case were comparatively limited in scope and the written and oral arguments far shorter than those in the first phase. Moreover, the Tribunal repeatedly expressed its expectation, most notably during the conference calls of 28 January 2013 and 29 May 2013, that the objections to be decided in Phase 2 could and should be dealt with more quickly and efficiently as compared to Phase 1. The Respondent's invocation of its need \"to defend fundamental policy choices that had been settled upon through the democratic process\" is unavailing as a justification for this disparity, especially since those \"policy choices\" pertain to the merits of the dispute between the Parties, which the Respondent has never been required to litigate given its success on jurisdiction. Therefore, while the Respondent was entitled to defend its interests vigorously, it would not be reasonable to require the Claimant to bear more than a portion of these costs under the circumstances.\n\n63.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, Tribunal considers that it is reasonable to direct that the Claimant shall pay to the Respondent the sum of EUR 1,000,000.00 in relation to the costs of legal assistance and representation. The Tribunal considers that this sum represents a reasonable proportion of those costs which were reasonably incurred, taking account of the factors set out above.\n\n**V. DISPOSITIF**\n-----------------\n\n64.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\ni. Under Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimant shall reimburse the Respondent in the amount of EUR 571,785.10 in respect of the costs of arbitration under Article 38(a), (b), (c), and (1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, plus interest at six-month LIBOR plus 2%, compounded bi-annually, from the date of this Award until full payment is made by the Claimant.\n\nii. Under Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimant shall contribute to the Respondent\u2019s costs of legal assistance and representation under Article 38(c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the amount of EUR 1,000,000.00, plus interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2%, compounded bi-annually, from the date of this Award until full payment is made by the Claimant."}]}
