It appears that easy cases do as well.\n\n3.\n\nThis is an easy case. The Czech Republic enacted legislation that provided unambiguous guarantees to investors in the renewable energy sector. These statutory guarantees provided that specified minimum tariffs would be paid for electricity produced by renewable energy sources for a period of 15 (later 20) years. The Claimants relied on these tariffs in making substantia] investments in the Czech Republic. Thereafter, despite its guarantees, the Czech Republic imposed a levy that significantly reduced the tariffs payable to certain renewable energy sources, including the Claimants\u2019 solar plants (the \"Solar Levy\"). That breach of the Czech Republic\u2019s previous guarantees is an obvious violation of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"Treaty\").\n\n4.\n\nThe majority refuses to accept this straightforward conclusion. Instead, the majority proposes a manifestly implausible interpretation of the relevant Czech legislation, which contradicts the plain language and obvious purposes of that legislation and which the Czech Republic itself has repeatedly rejected, including in this arbitration. The majority\u2019s conclusion may be regarded by some as expedient, but it is both demonstrably wrong and, in the long-term, destructive of the rule of law and the authority of the Czech Republic.\n\n**I. THE TREATY\u2019S FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT CLAUSEREQUIRES THE CZECH REPUBLIC TO HONOR ITS STABILIZATION COMMITMENTS TO FOREIGN INVESTORS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees on many issues in this case. The Tribunal agrees, of course, that the Treaty provides an unambiguous guarantee of fair and equitable treatment. Thus, Article 2(1) of the Treaty provides that \"Each Contracting State shall in every case accord investment fair and equitable treatment.\" Unlike many investment protection treaties, this guarantee is unqualified, assuring investors fair and equitable treatment \"in every case.\"1\n\nTreaty. Art. 2(1) (\"Each Contracting State shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors from the other Contracting State and admit such investments in accordance with its legislation. Each Contracting State shall in every case accord investments fair and equitable treatment.\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal is also in agreement that a provision for fair and equitable treatment, like that in Article 2(1) of the Treaty, requires a state to abide by its commitments to investors. In particular, as detailed below, where a state undertakes to provide an investor with specified treatment, protections or rights, whether by contract, statute, or otherwise, then its subsequent denial of that treatment or those rights will generally constitute a denial of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n7.\n\nIt is true that the obligation of fair and equitable treatment does not generally prevent a state from altering its legislative or regulatory regimes in response to changing economic, technological or other circumstances. In the words of one tribunal, \"the fair and equitable treatment standard does not give a right to regulatory stability *per se.* The state has a right to regulate, and investors must expect that the legislation will change, absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurance giving rise to a legitimate expectation of stability.\"2 Put differently, \"[i]n order to adapt to changing economic, political and legal circumstances the State\u2019s regulatory powers still remain in place,\"3 notwithstanding obligations of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*Ioan Micula et al* v. *Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Final Award, 11 December 2013, para. 666. *See also* *Sergei Paushok, et al* v. *The Government of Mongolia,* UNCITRAL Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 28 April 2011, para. 305 (\"An investor, without an agreement which limits or prohibits the possibility of tax increases, should not be surprised to be hit with tax increases in subsequent years and such an event could not be considered as \u2018unpredictable.\u2019\").\n\n*BG Group Plc.* v. *The Republic of Argentina,* UNCITRAL Ad Hoc Arbitration, Final Award, 24 December 2007, para. 298.\n\n8.\n\nNonetheless, it is equally well-established that a commitment to accord fair and equitable treatment provides investors with protections for their legal rights and legitimate expectations, including a right to compensation where a state\u2019s exercise of its legislative or regulatory authority frustrates those rights or expectations:\n\n\"where the investor has acquired rights, or where the state has acted in such a way so as to generate a legitimate expectation in the investor and that investor has relied on that expectation to make its investment, action by the state that reverses or destroys those legitimate expectations will be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and thus give rise to compensation.\"4\n\nOther awards are to the same effect, holding in multiple circumstances that a state\u2019s frustration of an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations gives rise to liability under a fair and equitable treatment obligation.5\n\n*loan Micula et al v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Final Award, 11 December 2013, para. 667. *See also* *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited* v. *The Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, para. 423 (\"The Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s position that the actions taken by it against the Claimants were merely an exercise of its rights under international law to regulate its domestic economic and legal affairs. It is the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of the basic international law principles that while a sovereign State possesses the inherent right to regulate its domestic affairs, the exercise of such right is not unlimited and must have its boundaries. As rightly pointed out by the Claimants, the rule of law, which includes treaty obligations, provides such boundaries. Therefore, when a State enters into a bilateral investment treaty like the one in this case, it becomes bound by it and the investment-protection obligations it undertook therein must be honoured rather than be ignored by a later argument of the State\u2019s right to regulate.\").\n\n*See* *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation* v. *The United Mexican States,* Award, 26 January 2006, para. 147 (\"where a Contracting Party\u2019s conduct creates reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part of an investor (or investment) to act in reliance on said conduct, such that a failure by the NAFTA Party to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer damages.\"); *CME Czech Republic B.

The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award 30 April 2004, para. 98 (\"it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"); *El Paso Energy/ International Company* v. *The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15.

Viewed rigorously, this analysis requires clarification. A state is ordinarily free to alter its \"legal and business environment,\" notwithstanding an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations; nonetheless, if a state does so in a manner that frustrates an investor\u2019s (or category of investors\u2019) legitimate expectations, it will be liable under international law to that investor (or category of investors) for compensation and other relief.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited* v. *Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, para. 173.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* Partial Award, 17 March 2006, para. 329. *See* authorities cited in note 5 above.\n\n10.\n\nOf course, however, these principles necessarily apply even more emphatically where a state provides express or implied assurances of particular treatment or guarantees of particular rights to an investor or a defined category of investors. In these circumstances, the state\u2019s failure to honor its undertakings to an investor (or category of investors) constitutes a denial of fair and equitable treatment, giving rise to liability for compensation under international law. Thus, authorities recognizing a state\u2019s freedom to revise or alter its legislative or regulatory regime also declare that a state may nonetheless make commitments to particular investors (or categories of investors) not to alter aspects of the relevant legal regime, and that the violation of these commitments will constitute a breach of obligations to accord investors fair and equitable treatment.9 Indeed, the Czech Republic correctly recognizes that \"a \u2018stabilization clause\u2019 creates an exception to the general rule that a State is free to amend or pass new laws without incurring BIT responsibility.\"10\n\n*See, e.g,* *Perenco Ecuador Ltd.* v. *Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and Liability, 12 September 2014, para. 586 (\"[I]t is well recognised in investment treaty arbitration that States retain flexibility to respond to changing circumstances *unless they have stabilised their relationship with an investor\")* (emphasis added); *Ioan Micula et al* v. *Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Final Award, II December 2013, para. 529 (\"Investors must expect that the legislation will change from time to time, *absent a stabilization clause or other sp\u00e9cifie assurances* giving rise to a legitimate expectation of stabilization.\") (emphasis added); *Total S.A.* v. *The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, para. 164 (\"[C]hanges to general legislation, in the absence of *specific stabilization promises* to the foreign investor, reflect a legitimate exercise of the host State\u2019s governmental powers that are not prevented by a BIT\u2019s standard and are not in breach of the same.\") (emphasis added). *See also* JAMES CRAWFORD, *Treaty and Contract in Investment Arbitration,* 24(3) ARBITRATION INTERNATIONAL 351 (2008), p. 370 (\"In the absence of *express stabilisation,* investors take the risk that the obligations of the host State under its own law may change\") (emphasis added).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 407.\n\n11.\n\nAs the majority acknowledges, it is also clear that a stabilization undertaking or assurance can arise either from a specific undertaking to an individual investor (for example, in a contract or similar instrument) or from a more general legislative or regulatory instrument (for example, a statute applicable to a class of investors).11 Thus, it is well-settled that a state may, under international law, make a binding commitment to foreign investors in its legislation, rather than in individual contracts or specific representations to individual investors. The Czech Republic itself recognizes this well-settled principle: \"What we\u2019re saying is that [legislation providing a stabilization guarantee] has to be very clear and explicit in terms of constituting a commitment of stabilization. *So, if the Legislature says we \u2019re going to stabilize this legal regime, then, of course, that would apply, certainly.* We\u2019re just saying that was not the case here at all.\"12 This concession was repeated on numerous other occasions.13\n\nAward, at paras. 407 and 409.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 83, lines 12-17 (emphasis added).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 83, lines 5-10 (\"[Arbitrator]:... [W]ould you accept as a general principle that a stabilization commitment or undertaking could be expressed by legislation as well as by contractual arrangement? [Counsel for Respondent]: We don\u2019t dispute that. We don\u2019t dispute that.\"); Transcript, Day 1, page 77, lines 7-12 (\"But mere legislative changes cannot constitute BIT violations unless\u2014unless\u2014the changes actually contravene a genuine stabilization guarantee by the State, and the Czech Republic never issued a stabilization guarantee to the Claimants, *whether in the legislation itself* or in any other fashion.\") (emphasis added); Transcript, Day 1, page 78, lines 17-23 (\"For mere legislative changes to be deemed a violation of any of the three BIT provisions that the Claimants have invoked, you would have to conclude that one or more of *those clauses in the general legislation* actually amounted to \u2018stabilization guarantees\u2019 as that term has been understood in the investment arbitration\u2014investment treaty law...\") (emphasis added); Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 409 (\"When States \u2018stabilize\u2019 legislation, they follow a particular process or procedure.\"). The Respondent argues instead that legislative commitments must be particularly clear and explicit to provide the basis for international liability on the part of a state. *Ibid,* at pp. 82 *et seq.*\n\n12.\n\nThis conclusion is compelled by the nature of fair and equitable treatment analysis, which focuses on the legal framework of a state,14 which seeks to ensure \"fair,\" \"equitable,\" and \"just\" conduct by states,15 and which serves to protect the legitimate expectations of investors.16 The decisive issue is not whether a state\u2019s undertaking is \"specific\" or \"general,\" or statutory or contractual, but whether the statements and actions of the state provide a sufficiently clear commitment to give rise under international law to legitimate expectations or legal rights on the part of an investor.\n\n*See* paras. 15-16 below.\n\nRUDOLF DOLZER, *Fair and Equitable Treatment: Today's Contours,* 12 SANTA Clara.1. INT'L L. 7 (2014), p. 12 (\"The acceptance of the standard is directly linked to the fundamental moral and legal grounding of the notion of fairness, anchored in a universally accepted sense of justice, but also in classic rules of customary law governing the protection of foreign nationals and companies.\"); STEPHAN W.

The Treaty\u2019s arbitration provisions apply to, and protect, all German investors, notwithstanding the absence of any contractual arbitration agreement or other \"specific\" commitment to arbitrate with the Claimants.23 Precisely the same principles and logic apply to other types of guarantees provided by the Czech Republic, including guarantees in its domestic legislation.\n\nRudolf Dolzer & Christoph Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2d ed. 2012), p. 254; Andrea Marco Steingruber, Consent in International Arbitration (2012), p. 202 (\"It has been observed that in investment arbitration arbitral jurisdiction is no longer premised on the privity of contracts, ie on reciprocity of negotiated consent, as under this new concept reciprocity is renounced and replaced by a sort of compulsory jurisdiction against the host state.\");.SGS\u2019 *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 February 2010, para. 70 (\"Although it was the subject of some discussion in the early years of investment treaty arbitration, it is now uniformly accepted that the ratification of a bilateral investment treaty containing such provisions constitutes a State's written consent to arbitration of covered disputes.\"); *Caratube International Oil Company LLP* v. *Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Award, 5 June 2012, para. 331 (\"If a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is based on an investment treaty, claimant does not negotiate an individual agreement with the host State but accepts a non-negotiable offer addressed to persons or entities that fulfil its conditions. That offer is contained in an investment treaty and its conditions are agreed between the parties to that investment treaty. Unlike in the context of investment contracts, the acceptance of an offer contained in an investment treaty cannot create an assumption that the claimant fulfils the conditions of that offer.\"). *See also* JAN Paulsson, *Arbitration without Privity,* 10.2 ICSID Rev. 232 (1995), p. 232 (\"This new world of arbitration is one where the claimant need not to have a contractual relationship with the defendant [state]).\"\n\n15.\n\nIn contemporary market economies, operating under the rule of law, it is both commonplace and essential for states to be able to provide undertakings to private parties by way of \"general\" legislative or regulatory instruments. In many circumstances, modern states cannot as a practical matter negotiate contracts with large numbers of parties, but must instead regulate the conduct of private parties through legislation and regulations. Indeed, this is a distinguishing feature of a system founded on the rule of law, where legislative and regulatory provisions, rather than individual governmental directions, govern private conduct. It would seriously impede the task of governance and regulation, and contradict aspirations for the rule of law, to deny states the ability to make commitments to private parties, including foreign investors, in the form of legislative (or regulatory) guarantees.\n\n16.\n\nPut simply, and unsurprisingly, the Tribunal is in agreement that international law recognizes and gives effect to the power of states to make binding, internationally-enforceable commitments to private parties. Where a state undertakes, by contract, legislation or otherwise, to provide specified treatment to a foreign investor, that undertaking will be given effect under international law, and violations of that undertaking will give rise to claims for compensation by the investor under commitments to provide fair and equitable treatment. In doing so, international law does not constrain the autonomy of states, but rather gives effect to it, by enabling states to provide reliable and enforceable commitments to private parties, in order to obtain necessary investments or other benefits from those parties.\n\n**II. THE CZECH REPUBLIC GUARANTEED THAT IT WOULD MAINTAIN FEED-IN TARIFFS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AT FIXED MINIMUM LEVELS FOR 15 YEARS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe application of the foregoing principles in this case should be straightforward. It is clear that the Claimants made substantial investments in the renewable energy sector in the Czech Republic in reliance on unequivocal statutory guarantees provided by the Act No. 180/2005 Coll., On The Support of Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy Sources (the \"Act on Promotion\" or the \"Act\"). In particular, as the majority acknowledges, the Claimants relied on the guarantees provided by Section 6 of the Act regarding the level of the \"feed-in tariffs\" (\"FiTs\") for electricity produced by photovoltaic solar plants.24 As a consequence, the only question in this arbitration, and the only question that divides the Tribunal, is what these statutory guarantees provided.\n\nAward, at paras. 414 and 417.\n\n18.\n\nIn my view, the plain language and obvious purposes of Section 6(1) of the Act leave no serious doubt that the Claimants were guaranteed a minimum level of FiTs over a specified statutory period (first 15, later 20, years) for electricity produced by the renewable energy sources that they constructed in the Czech Republic. It is also clear, again as the majority concedes,25 that the Czech Republic\u2019s imposition of the Solar Levy reduced the level of FiTs payable under the Act to the Claimants and other investors in the solar energy sector. That reduction in the minimum level of FiTs provided by Section 6(1) of the Act contradicted the Act\u2019s statutory guarantees to solar investors and thereby violated the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment guarantees.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* at para. 271. *See also* Transcript, Day 1, page 115, lines 17 to 19 (\"Of course, you know, [the Claimants] suffered a financial detriment as a result of the Measures 1 believe. That\u2019s uncontested....\") (Counsel for Respondent).\n\n19.\n\nSection 6 of the Act is titled \"*Amounts of Prices for Electricity* from Renewable Sources and Amounts of Green Bonuses.\" The obvious, and express, purpose of Section 6 was to prescribe the *\"amounts of prices\"* payable to electricity producers for electricity produced from a specific category of sources (namely, renewable energy sources). As discussed below, the Act prescribed these prices - which differed from the prices for all other types of electricity in the Czech Republic - for a critical public purpose, namely, to encourage the production of electricity from renewable energy sources and thus to satisfy the Czech Republic\u2019s commitments to the European Union regarding renewable energy.\n\n20.\n\nSection 6 of the Act then goes on to provide, in the Czech Republic\u2019s translation of the Act, that \"[t]he Office [or \"ERO\"] sets, one calendar year in advance, *the purchasing prices for electricity from Renewable Sources (the \u2018Purchasing Prices\u2019),* separately for individual kinds of Renewable Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that...(b) for facilities commissioned... [2] after the effective date of this Act, *the amount of revenues per unit of electricity from Renewable Sources, assuming support in the form of Purchasing Prices, is maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues]26 for a period of 15 years* from the commissioning year of the facility, taking into account the industrial producer price index.\"27 The text of Section 6 is unambiguous. Section 6 provides that the ERO will establish, one year in advance, the \"Purchasing Prices\" for electricity produced from specified renewable energy sources, and then guarantees that these \"Purchasing Prices\" and the \"revenues per unit of electricity\" from the specified energy sources will be *\"maintained as the minimum* for a period of 15 years\" from the date of commissioning of each source, subject only to the possibility of upward (not downward) adjustment of the price for inflation.\n\nText in parentheses appears in the Czech Republic\u2019s original translation.\n\nExhibit R-004 (Respondent\u2019s Translation of Article 6 of Act 180) (emphasis added).\n\n21.\n\nSection 6 is unequivocal. It guarantees that the FiTs for electricity produced from specified renewable energy sources will be maintained for 15 (later 20) years from the date of commissioning of the source. The provision required that the FiTs for electricity produced from renewable energy sources commissioned in a particular year be fixed by the ERO, one year in advance, and then maintained (as a minimum) for a 15-year period following commissioning of a source - that is, *\"for a period of 15 years from the commissioning year of the facility.*\"28 As discussed below, this long-term guarantee of a specific minimum FiT for each renewable energy source, following its commissioning, was essential to the Act\u2019s structure and purposes.29\n\nAct on Promotion, Section 6(1)(b)(2), Exhibit R-004 (Respondent\u2019s Translation of Article 6 of Act 180) (emphasis added).\n\n*See* paras. 27-38 below.\n\n22.\n\nIn my view, these provisions leave no serious question that the Act guaranteed owners of renewable energy sources fixed minimum FiTs for electricity produced by these sources for a period of 15 (later 20) years. There is no other plausible way to read Section 6, and particularly Section 6(1)(b)(2), of the Act. In turn, these guaranteed minimum FiTs were vitally important to the Act\u2019s objective of providing long-term stability for investors in renewable energy and to the Czech Republic\u2019s objective of attracting such investors and developing a renewable energy sector.\n\n23.\n\nDespite the plain language and obvious purposes of the Act, the majority declares that \"Section 6(1) of [the Act on Promotion]... contains no separate guarantee of an absolute level of revenue, set independently of the FIT system that guarantees a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment of at least 7% per year over 15 (later 20) years.\"30 Instead, the majority concludes, the Czech Republic only \"promised that the buy-out on FiT would be set at a level ensuring a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment or profit of at least 7% per year over 15 years for those solar PV plants that met the relevant parameters.\"31\n\nAward, at para. 413.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* at para. 369.\n\n24.\n\nSimply put, the majority concludes that Section 6 of the Act did not guarantee that the FiTs established by the ERO for energy sources commissioned in a particular year would be maintained, as a minimum, for 15 (later 20) years, pursuant to Section 6 (1)(b)(2), but only guaranteed that the FiTs payable for electricity produced by renewable energy sources would allow a return of investment in 15 (later 20) years, pursuant to Section 6(1)(b)(1).32 According to the majority, this interpretation of Section 6(1) follows from reading the Act \"in its entirety,\"33 which supposedly indicates that there is \"no separate guarantee of an absolute level of revenue\"34 and that \"there is no abstract promise of\u2018revenues\u2019 to investors.\"35\n\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation also introduces into its interpretation of Section 6(1)(b)(1) the notion that the Act guarantees a \"profit of at least 7% per year\" or \"a return on investment of at least 7% per year;\" Award, at para. 367. There is nothing in Section 6(1)(b)(1), or any other part of the Act. that refers to a \"7% per year\" profit or return on investment, or to any other return on investment. The figure seized upon by the majority, and converted into a statutory guarantee, is derived exclusively from later administrative rulings of the ERO, which have no basis in the text of the Act or its statutory guarantees.\n\nAward, at para. 367.\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 413.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* at para. 367.\n\n25.\n\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act is impossible to accept. The majority is correct in acknowledging that the Act provides a statutory guarantee to investors, which can be given effect by the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment clause. Nonetheless, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the content of this guarantee is fundamentally wrong. The majority\u2019s interpretation contradicts the unequivocal text of the Act on Promotion, the undisputed purposes of the Act and the Czech Republic\u2019s unambiguous confirmations of the Act\u2019s meaning. Indeed, the majority\u2019s reading of the Act ignores the Czech Republic\u2019s own repeated and explicit statements regarding Section 6 in this arbitration.\n\n26.\n\nIn assessing the majority\u2019s interpretation, it is useful to begin with the language of the Act. Section 6(1) provides:\n\n*\"Amounts of Prices for Electricity* from Renewable Sources and Amounts of Green Bonuses\n\n(1) The Office sets, one calendar year in advance, the *purchasing prices for electricity* from Renewable Sources (the \"Purchasing Prices\"), separately for individual kinds of Renewable Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that...\n\nb) *for facilities commissioned*\n\n1. after the effective date of this Act, there is attained, with the support consisting of the Purchasing Prices, a fifteen year payback period on capital expenditures, provided technical and economic parameters are met, such parameters consisting of, in particular, cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation efficiency of the primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the facility, such parameters being stipulated in an implementing legal regulation,\n\n2. *after the effective date of this Act, the amount of revenues per unit of electricity from Renewable Sources, assuming support in the form of Purchasing Prices, is maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues]36, for a period of 15 years* from the commissioning year of the facility, taking into account the industrial producer price index; the commissioning of a facility is also deemed to include cases involving the completion of a rebuild of the technological part of existing equipment, a change of fuel, or the completion of modernization that raises the technical and ecological standard of an existing facility...\"37\n\nText in parentheses appears in the Czech Republic\u2019s original translation.\n\nExhibit R-004 (Respondent\u2019s Translation of Article 6 of Act 180) (emphasis added). The Claimants submitted a different translation of Section 6 of the Act on Promotion, *see* Exhibit C-31 (Claimants\u2019 Translation of Article 6 of Act 180): Award, at para. 23.\n\n27.\n\nContrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, Section 6 plainly provided two separate, but related, guarantees. It is crystal clear that Section 6(1)(b)(1) guaranteed that the ERO would set FiTs (\"the Purchasing Prices\") intended to achieve at a minimum a 15-year return on investment, while Section 6(1)(b)(2) then guaranteed that those FiTs, once set by the ERO for renewable energy sources commissioned in a particular year, would not be reduced for 15 years for sources commissioned in that year. In the words of Section 6(1)(b)(2), \"the *amount of revenues per unit of electricity* from Renewable Sources, assuming support in the form of Purchasing Prices, *is maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues], for a period of 15 years...*.\" This text, and the combined effect of Section 6(1)(b)(1) and 6(1)(b)(2), unequivocally guaranteed that, once the Purchasing Prices (or FiTs) for electricity produced by a particular category of renewable energy source were set by the ERO for sources commissioned in a particular year, neither those prices nor the resulting revenues per unit of electricity would be reduced for a 15-year period.\n\n28.\n\nThe majority\u2019s award excises Section 6(1)(b)(2)\u2019s guarantee of a fixed minimum FiT, payable for 15 years after commissioning of a source, from the Act. In the majority\u2019s view, the Act does not provide a \"guarantee of an absolute level of revenue.\" Rather, as noted above, in the majority\u2019s view, the Act only guarantees FiTs that would be set at a level that would provide a return of investment in 15 (later 20) years. That conclusion effectively rewrites the Act and is impossible to reconcile with the plain language of Section 6(1)(b)(2).\n\n29.\n\nThe Act did not only provide (as it did in Section 6 (1)(b)(1)) that the ERO would establish FiTs that would provide at least a return of investment in 15 (later 20) years. The Act also provided, unequivocally (in Section 6(1)(b)(2)), that, once the ERO established a FiT, one year in advance, for renewable energy sources commissioned in the following year, that FiT would then be maintained for a 15 (later 20) year period. The majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act rewrites Section 6, deleting Section 6(1)(b)(2), and its fundamentally important guarantee of long-term price stability, from the statute.\n\n30.\n\nThe majority asserts that Section 6 of the Act must be read \"in its entirety.\"38 That is obvious, but does nothing to rescue the majority\u2019s reading of the Act. Instead, this rule confirms that the majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 6 is wrong.\n\nAward, at para. 367.\n\n31.\n\nAs discussed above, Section 6(1) of the Act provides two separate, but related, guarantees to investors: (a) that the ERO would set FiTs to provide a \"return of investment\" within a \"fifteen-year period of time;\" and (b) that once a source was commissioned, \"revenues... per unit of electricity\" and \"Purchasing Prices\" for electricity produced by that source would be \"maintained\" for a 15-year period. These were related, but separate, statutory guarantees. Implausibly, the majority simply reads the latter guarantee out of the Act in violation of the very rules of statutory interpretation that it invokes.\n\n32.\n\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation is also impossible to reconcile with Section 6(4) of the Act. Section 6(4) established a so-called \"5% limit\" or \"5% brake rule,\" requiring the annual FiTs established by the ERO for a particular year to be no less than 5% lower than the FiTs that had been set for the preceding year.39 This rule provided that \"Purchasing Prices set by the Office for the following calendar year shall not be less than 95% of the Purchasing Prices in effect in the year for which the setting decision is made.\"40\n\nAct on Promotion, Section 6(4), Exhibit R-004 (Respondent\u2019s Translation of Article 6 of Act 1 80).\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n33.\n\nSection 6(4) inevitably created the possibility that the FiTs set by the ERO for a particular year (\"the Purchasing Prices\") would provide a higher rate of return than that specified in Section 6(1)(b)(1).41 Indeed, this was the specific and sole purpose of Section 6(4)\u2019s brake rule - namely, to provide FiTs that were *higher* than those prescribed by Section 6(1)(b)(1).\n\nThis was confirmed by the Czech Republic\u2019s fact and expert witnesses: Transcript. Day 2, page 249. line 25 to page 250, line 12 **[REDACTED]** \"[The ERO] was supposed to set the tariffs for the subsequent periods, feed-in tariffs for these sources. As I have said with respect to other sources, there were no problems because there were no extremes. However, with regard to power solar stations, because the costs decreased sharply, the regulatory office was supposed to intervene and proportionately reduce the tariffs for the subsequent period. But that was not allowed by the law because the promotion act in one of the Clauses include the 5% ceiling for the feed-in tariff or for reduction of feed-in tariffs, and, therefore, that created the disproportionate situation.\"); Transcript, Day 2, page 462, line 19 to page 463, line 21 (\u2019\u2019[Arbitrator]: I would like to go back quickly just to your Slide Number 4, where you say that the FITs in the Czech Republic were designed to offer a reasonable rate of return, and what 1 would like you to focus on is this 5% limit on the regression or reduction in the FiTs and tell me if you agree with what I\u2019m about to say. That aspect of the legislation was, in fact, intended to do something more than provide investors with a reasonable return. By definition, it was intended to do something else; is that correct? [Wynne Jones:] Not necessarily to give them a higher rate of return but to protect the level of tariff that is expected for when the plant does come to fruition. [Arbitrator:] But if you\u2019re in a world where technology is reducing the costs of constructing different kinds of plants, quite likely more than 5%, doesn\u2019t that necessarily mean that you will be giving investors more\u2014 [Wynne Jones:] Absolutely. If the 5% degression binds, and that means that the estimate of a fair FIT giving a reasonable return would imply a degression of greater than 5%, then by giving 5%, you\u2019re inevitably giving above the reasonable rate of return. [Arbitrator:] Exactly. *And so, the only time that the 5% ever comes into play will he in circumstances where, by definition, you \u2019re giving the Investor more than a 5%-more than a reasonable rate of return?* [Wynne Jones]: *Yes\")* (emphasis added). *See also* Respondent\u2019s Statement of Defence, para. 274 (\"The inability of the RES Scheme to adjust to such an unanticipated but massive change of the external conditions that determined a key input for the level of the FiTs (due to the maximum 5% variation that was permitted in the FITs year-on-year) created an opportunity for windfall profits. The return on capital invested became significantly in excess of the 7% p.a. that had been communicated to the investors by the regulator as the rate of return anticipated in the RES Scheme. The payback period of the investments dropped dramatically below the 15 years anticipated by the Act on Promotion.\").\n\n34.\n\nDespite this, the majority reads Section 6(1)(b) as only maintaining FiTs at the level prescribed by Section 6(1)(b)(1)\u2019s guarantee of a \"return of investment\" in 15 years. That reading is impossible to reconcile with either the language or the purpose of Section 6(4), which necessarily meant that there would be cases where the FiTs established by the ERO were *higher* than those provided by Section 6(1)(b)(1)\u2019s 15-year return of investment period. By interpreting Section 6(1)(b)(2) as guaranteeing only FiTs that provided a 15-year return on investment, the majority ignores not only the plain language of Section 6(1)(b)(2), but also reads Section 6(4) out of the Act. That once more violates the very rules of statutory interpretation the majority purports to rely upon.\n\n35.\n\nThe majority cites text in Section 6(1)(b)(2) providing that the \"amount of the revenues stays unchanged for the unit of the electricity from the renewable sources with the support of the buy-out prices for the period of time of 15 years.\"42 According to the majority, because the ERO fixed \"the buy-out prices\" with the objective of producing return of investment in 15 years pursuant to Section 6(1)(b)(1), the fixed \"amount of revenues... for the unit of electricity\" under Section 6(1)(b)(2) did nothing more than provide a 15 year return on investment.43 In the majority\u2019s words, which it is necessary to quote in full:\n\n\"Subsection (b)(2) makes reference to the buy-out prices\u2019 mentioned in subsection (b)(1), expressly stating that they are to \u2018support\u2019 the \u2018revenues\u2019 of solar PV plants. The buy-out prices themselves are set following the criteria contained in the Technical Regulation and the ERO methodology, which state that the price will ensure a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment of at least 7% per year over 15 years. Thus, there is no abstract promise of \u2018revenues\u2019 to investors. The revenues are tied to the buy-out prices, and the buy-out prices are, in turn, tied to the guarantee of a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment or profit of at least 7% per year over 15 years.\"44\n\nAward, at para. 366.\n\n*Ibid,* at para. 367.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* at para. 367.\n\n36.\n\nAlthough difficult to follow, this reasoning is plainly wrong. Section 6(1)(b)(2) expressly guarantees that the *\"amount of revenues per unit of electricity from Renewable Sources,* assuming support in the form of Purchasing Prices, *is maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues]45 for a period of 15 years.\"* There is no conceivable way for the \"amount of revenues... per unit of electricity\" to be *\"maintained''* if, as the majority concludes, the Purchasing Prices can be reduced after they have been fixed by the ERO. Rather, as Section 6(1)(b)(2) unequivocally provides, both the \"revenues... per unit of electricity\" and the \"Purchasing Prices\" must be \"maintained\" for the 15 years. The majority\u2019s interpretation again squarely contradicts the statute\u2019s text.\n\nText in parentheses appears in the Czech Republic\u2019s original translation.\n\n37.\n\nThe majority concludes that Section 6 does not provide for fixed minimum FiTs, but only for FiTs that provide a return on investment over 15 (later 20) years at 7% per annum.46 As a consequence, according to the majority, FiTs could change every year, after they were established and applied to a particular source, increasing or decreasing, depending on the ERO\u2019s judgment, production and transmission costs and other factors. That conclusion is wholly contrary to Section 6(1)(b)(2)\u2019s explicit guarantee that the \"amount of revenues per unit of electricity from Renewable Sources\" is *\"maintained as the minimum...* for a period of 15 years *from the commissioning year of the facility.\"* Likewise, the majority\u2019s conclusion is wholly contrary to Section 6(4) of the Act, which specifically provided for FiTs in excess of Section 6(1)(b)(1)\u2019s formula.\n\nAs noted above, the 7% per annum figure relied on by the majority has no basis in the Act. *See* note 32 above, it is based entirely on later administrative regulations.\n\n38.\n\nThe majority asserts that Section 6(1)(b)(2) provides \"no abstract promise of revenues.\" That is again wrong and irrelevant. What Section 6(1)(b)(2) provides is a very specific and concrete promise that the \"revenues... per unit of electricity\" fixed by the ERO under Section 6(1)(b)(1) for sources commissioned in a particular year will be \"maintained\" for that source for 15 (later 20) years. This is not an \"abstract,\" but a very concrete, promise \u2014 a promise that is expressly provided by Section 6(1)(b)(2) and that is vitally important to the Act\u2019s regulatory and commercial purposes.\n\n39.\n\nIn sum, the majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 6 is impossible to reconcile with the language of the Act. The majority\u2019s interpretation contradicts the express terms of Sections 6(1)(b)(2) and 6(4) of the Act, effectively reading both provisions out of the Act. Simply put, the majority rewrites unequivocal statutory language to (supposedly) mean the opposite of what it says.\n\n40.\n\nIt is telling that the majority does not address any of the foregoing points in its reasoning. Nowhere, apart from a conclusory assertion of its views, does the majority engage with the specific guarantees in both Sections 6(1)(b)(1) and 6(1)(b)(2) or the text of Section 6(4). In my view, that silence confirms the plain meaning of the Act\u2019s guarantees.\n\n41.\n\nThe majority also entirely ignores the regulatory and commercial purposes of the Act. It is clear that Section 6(1)(b)(2)\u2019s guarantee of fixed FiTs payable for electricity produced by qualifying renewable energy sources over a specified period of time was central to the Act\u2019s purposes and objectives.\n\n42.\n\nIt is undisputed that the production of electricity from renewable energy sources in the Czech Republic was not economically feasible without very substantial state subsidies; the prices prevailing in the market for electricity, produced by other sources, were significantly below the prices that were required to justify either construction or financing of renewable energy sources.47 This was especially true given the very substantial and disproportionate upfront capital investments, in newly-developed technologies, which were required for renewable energy installations.48\n\nWynne Jones First Report, p. 24, at para. 4.5. *See also* Exhibit 0NYX3 (T. Couture and others, \"A Policymaker\u2019s Guide to Feed-in Tariff Policy Design\"), p. 25, al para. 4.2.1.1; Exhibit R-170 (English language transcript of a television interview by B. Nemecek [Former Vice Chairman of the ERO] to \"Hyde Park,\" Czech Public Television,), p. 4 (\"[W]e could say the agreement across the sector, was that, although it was a risky business of renewable resources, i.e. [power] generation, which depended on numerous external factors, there was, nevertheless, a statutory guarantee and therefore it should be provided with the same profitability as the other regulated activities.\").\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 64, lines 2 to 6 (\"[T]he costs of renewable energies arc high, the capital costs arc high, and, therefore, it made it difficult for producers to compete under normal market circumstances, and that's why they needed the Subsidies regime.\"). *See generally,* Exhibit 0NYX7 (P.

I (\"At the moment, when the owners of the power plants secure the first fifteen years of operation, they will have the possibility to obtain money from non-state sector... according to the Minister of Environment Libor Ambrozek.\").\n\n44.\n\nSpecifically, the Czech government was committed to increasing significantly the amount of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the Czech Republic, both for domestic policy goals and to comply with commitments undertaken to the European Union (which established an indicative national target of 8% of electricity production from renewable energy sources).50 These commitments to renewable energy were the results of a lengthy, sustained process of international cooperation, which included the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (setting forth commitments to the reduction of greenhouse gases), the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (setting forth targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases) and, eventually, the EU\u2019s Renewable Energy Directive of 2001 (setting forth indicative targets for electricity production from renewable energy sources). In order to achieve these objectives, and to realize a significant increase in the use of renewable energy in the Czech Republic, it was clear that substantial governmental support for the renewable energy sector was required.51\n\nExhibit CE-28 (Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market), Art. 3, Annex.\n\n**[REDACTED]** Report, p. 33, at para. 104. *See also* Exhibit CE-32 (Statement by Milan Urban. Minister of Industry and Trade, during the parliamentary deliberations of the support scheme in the Chamber of Deputies on 12 February 2004). p. 1; Exhibit C-35 (Statement of Milan Urban, Minister of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic, during the Parliamentary deliberations of the support scheme in the Chamber of Deputies on 31 March 2005). p.

Only in this manner it is possible to fulfil the requirements of the European Union according to the Minister of Environment Libor Ambrozek.\").\n\n45.\n\nConsequently, in order to encourage private investment, and to facilitate lending, in the renewable energy sector, the Czech Republic guaranteed that investors in renewable energy sources would receive specified FiTs, set in advance, for defined time periods. These FiTs ensured that investors, and their financial lenders, would receive a pre-determined, publicly-disclosed FiT for all electricity produced by qualifying sources over the predicted useful life of their investment - first 15 years, later extended to 20 years. In so doing, the FiTs provide the commercial incentives for investments and the necessary security for lenders that market prices alone would not provide.52\n\nExhibit R-162 (Report on the Achievement of the Indicative Target for Renewable Electricity Production in the Year 2007), p. 3.\n\n46.\n\nAbsent these guarantees of specific minimum FiTs over a defined time period, neither the Claimants nor many other investors - nor their lenders - would have constructed solar and other renewable energy plants in the Czech Republic. Section 6(1)(b)(2) specifically guaranteed that, once fixed by the ERO, FiTs would be maintained for 15 (later 20) years precisely to protect investors against the risk of the ERO (or others) reducing the FiTs payable for electricity from a source after it had been constructed. In so doing, Section 6(1)(b)(2) provided the long-term stability for investors that the electricity market did not provide, but that was essential if a renewable energy sector was to be developed.\n\n47.\n\nIn my view, it is essential to appreciate this background, both regulatory and commercial. Put simply, the entire renewable energy sector in the Czech Republic (as in a number of other states) was based on the commitment of the state, like the commitments of other states, that the prices paid for electricity produced from renewable energy sources would be maintained unchanged (except for upward adjustments to reflect inflation) for a specified period of time, regardless of market conditions or regulatory judgments. In turn, this provided investors and lenders with the security that was otherwise absent in the renewable energy sector.\n\n48.\n\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act is wholly contrary to these straightforward legislative and regulatory objectives. The majority reads Section 6(1)(b)(2)\u2019s guarantee of a fixed minimum FiT for 15 years out of the Act, and instead interprets the Act to allow repeated changes in the FiTs payable to renewable energy sources. Instead, as noted above, under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act, FiTs could be changed every year, or several times a year - so long as the ERO concluded that Section 6(1)(b)(2)\u2019s 15 (later 20) year payback period for return of investment was satisfied. This possibility of continuous price fluctuations and uncertainty is antithetical to the Act\u2019s purposes, as well as the plain language of Section 6(1)(b)(2).\n\n49.\n\nSimply put, the majority\u2019s interpretation makes no commercial sense and would have never attracted the investment in the renewable energy sector that the Czech Republic required. Moreover, the majority\u2019s interpretation produces profound unfairness and inequity. In reliance on Section 6\u2019s express statutory guarantees, the Claimants made substantial investments, providing the Czech Republic with the renewable energy and renewable energy sector that it desired. Once those investments were made, however, the Czech Republic imposed the Solar Levy, abrogating the guarantees it had previously provided. Neither that nor the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act comports with the Treaty or with basic fairness and equity'.\n\n50.\n\nThe majority\u2019s reading of Section 6(1)(b)(2) also ignores the multiple ways in which the Czech Republic itself has consistently described Section 6 and the Act on Promotion as providing a guarantee of minimum FiTs or Purchasing Prices for a 15-year period to investors in renewable energy sources. These various descriptions are impossible to reconcile with the majority\u2019s assertion that the Act only guaranteed a particular \"return on investment\" and not minimum FiTs or Purchasing Prices for electricity. It is important to quote these descriptions in detail to ensure that their meaning is not mistaken or neglected.\n\na. The Czech Minister for Industry and Trade described the Act on Promotion, during the legislative approval process, as follows: \"In the field of the support of electricity from renewable energy sources, the bill brings especially the *long-term guarantee of feed-in tariffs* and therefore it secures a stable business environment, which the potential investors call for intensively.\"53 Other government ministers made similarly explicit statements confirming that FiTs for electricity produced from renewable energy were guaranteed for fixed periods.54 These statements focused specifically on the guaranteed FiTs, over a 15-year period, and not, as the majority suggests, on FiTs that would produce a \"return of investment\" in 15 years.\n\nb. The Czech Republic stated in a revised 2005 Report on the Act on Promotion that: \"Act No 180/2005 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, which *guaranteed the long-term, stable support required for business decisions,* entered into effect on 1 August 2005. As of 1 January 2006 this Act introduced a new support system, the key features of which are:... *the guarantee of revenue per unit of electricity) produced over a 15-year period* as of the date a plant is put into operation [and] the *preservation of the level of feed-in tariffs for 15 years* for plants already in operation.\"55 Again, these statements focused specifically on the guaranteed FiTs (or \"revenue\" and \"feed-in tariffs\"), over a 15-year period, and not, as the majority incorrectly reasons, on guaranteed \"profit\" or \"return of investment.\"\n\nc. The Czech Republic explained in a 2005 Report to the European Commission that the Act on Promotion \"provides for an *unprecedented system of support in the form of fixed purchase feed-in) prices* and, where necessary, supplements to market prices for electricity, and *also guarantees a level of return on each unit of electricity produced for a period of 15 years.\"56* Once more, the Czech Republic\u2019s statements were directed specifically to the guaranteed FiTs, over a 15-year period, and not, as the majority suggests, on \"return of investment.\"\n\nd. The Czech Republic explained in another 2005 report to the United Nations that \"[t]he system of support [under Section 6 of the Act on Promotion] is based particularly on... providing *guarantees to the investors and owners of installations,* producing electricity from renewable sources who are subject to support pursuant to the Act, that *the amount of revenue per unit of produced electricity from renewable sources acquired by the producers from the support will be maintained for a period of 15 years* from bringing the installation into operation (or for a period of 15 years for installations that were brought into operation prior to the date of effect of the Act).\"57 The same report stated that \"Act No. 180/2000 Coll, newly introduced *a fifteen-year guarantee of minimum purchase prices from the date of bringing the installations into operation..*,\"58 Once more, these statements were directed specifically to guaranteed \"revenue\" and \"minimum purchase prices\" for a 15-year period, not to \"profits\" or \"return of investment.\"\n\ne. The ERO\u2019s Pricing Regulation for renewable energy provided, among other things, that *\"Feed-in tariffs* and green bonuses determined pursuant to the [Act on Promotion] *shall apply throughout the entire expected lifetime of the facility producing electricity* as set out by the Public Notice implementing certain provisions of the [Act on Promotion], *Throughout such lifetime of the facility producing electricity,* which falls in the relevant category determined pursuant to the type of renewable source used and date of putting into operation, *the feed-in tariffs shall be increased annually* taking in consideration the price index of industry manufacturers at least by 2% and at maximum by 4%, with the exception of facilities combusting biomass and biogas.\"59 Again, the Czech Republic\u2019s focus was on guaranteed levels of \"feed-in tariffs,\" not just \"profits\" or \"return of investment.\"\n\nf. The Czech Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s website, available to the public, stated that \"The *amount of the feed-in tariffs is guaranteed for period of 15 years* and prices indices of industry products are taken in consideration here. In contrast to green bonuses, the *fifteen-year guarantee of amount of revenues* for electricity unit since the year of putting the facility for production of electricity from renewable energy sources into operation *must not be influenced.\"60* The Czech Renewable Energy Agency also confirmed on its website that the FiTs not only apply during the lifetime of the plant but are also adjusted based on the Index of Industrial Production and thereafter subsequently increased by a minimum of 2%.61 Yet again, this refers unequivocally to guarantees of the \"amounts of the feed-in-tariffs\" and \"amount of revenues for electricity unit,\" not \"profits\" or \"return of investment.\"\n\ng. The ERO stated in a 2007 Report on its activities that \"From the perspective of *guaranteed support for renewable resources,* another major change was the amendment to public notice no. 150/2007, on regulatory methods in the energy industries and procedures for price control. *The new provisions set forth that feed-in tariffs and green premiums shall be applied throughout the service life of electricity generating* plants and also that *feed-in tariffs shall be increased annually to reflect PPI [the Index of Industrial Production],* by at least two per cent but no more than by four per cent, throughout the service life of electricity generating plants, with the exception of those that fire biomass and biogas.\"62 Once more, the focus was unequivocally on guaranteed FiTs, not profits or return of investment.\n\nh. The ERO conducted presentations to foreign investors both inside and outside of the Czech Republic, including presentations in Prague, Warsaw and elsewhere. These road-shows included powerpoint presentations that told potential investors that the Act on Promotion provided a 15-year guarantee of FiTs.63\n\ni. For example, in a 2006 presentation in Prague, the ERO stated that \"[s]upport of electricity production from renewable sources in accordance with Act no. 180/2005 Coll\" included \"economic return 15 years\" and *\"keeping of support for 15 years* in due consideration of price index of industry producers *(regarding feed-in tariffs').\"64*\n\nii. The following year, in a presentation in Warsaw entitled \"Support of Renewable Electricity in the Czech Republic,\" the ERO reiterated that the Act on Promotion \"guaranteed\" a \"15 years payback period of investments.\"65 Similarly, the Czech Energy Agency stated in a presentation given in a 2006 workshop in Beroun that the Act on Promotion provided a *\"guarantee for tariffs for 15 years* (tariff assessments of ER[O]).\"66\n\ni. The Czech Republic\u2019s 2010 Action Plan, submitted to the European Union in July 2010, addressed the question \"[h]ow long is the *fixed tariff guaranteed,\"* by stating *\"[t]ariffs are guaranteed* according to the following table,\" listing a *\"Feed-in price guarantee* (in years)\" for photovoltaic sources as *\"20 [years].\"67* The same Action Plan also stated, in response to a question whether \"any tariff adjustment [is] foreseen in the scheme,\" by stating that \"Feed-in prices for new production installations are calculated on an annual basis, taking into account current investment costs. *For existing sources, i.e. production installations already in operation, the prices are increased by 2 to 4 percent according to the development of the industrial producer price index.\"68* The same document stated that there were no caps on the amounts of electricity eligible for the guaranteed tariffs.69 As with all the Czech Republic\u2019s other statements, the Action Plan referred to guaranteed \"tariffs\" and \"feed-in-prices,\" not \"return of investment.\"\n\nj. A \"Frequently Asked Questions\" section on the ERO\u2019s website reproduces the provisions of Public Notice No 150/2007, including the statements that the \"*feed-in-tariffs and green bonuses apply throughout the useful life of the plants\"* and that the *\"the feed-in tariffs are adjusted annually to the Index for Industrial Production and increased - except for plants producing biomass and biogas energy - by at least 2%, however no more than 4%.\"70* The FAQs also address the question whether \"it [is] correct, that the anticipated useful life for the photovoltaic systems was extended and hence also the time period the feed-in-tariff... to be paid\" by confirming that *\"feed-in-tariffs and green bonus for the photovoltaic systems commissioned after 1 January 2008 may be claimed for 20 years.*\"71 One again, the references are to guaranteed \"feed-in-tariffs,\" not \"return of investment.\"\n\nk. Public statements made throughout the relevant time period by the representatives of the Czech Republic consistently emphasized the government\u2019s commitment to providing a stable legal framework for the investors and guaranteed FiTs for a 20-year period.72 Similarly, Czech authorities repeatedly declared that governmental support under the Act on Promotion provided a \"stable business environment\"73 for specific categories of renewable energy investors,74 including assurances that \"the *amount of the feed-in tariffs is guaranteed for period of 15 years.\"75*\n\nExhibit CE-35 (Statement of Milan Urban, Minister of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic, during the Parliamentary deliberations of the support scheme in the Chamber of Deputies on 31 March 2005), p. 1 (emphasis added).\n\nExhibit CE-42 (Press article of 23 February 2005 available at lHNED.cz), p. 1 (\"At the moment, when the owners of the power plants *secure the first fifteen years of operation, they will have the possibility to obtain money from non-slate sector...* according to the Minister of Environment Libor Ambrozek.\") (emphasis added); Exhibit CE-35 (Statement of Milan Urban, Minister of Industry and Trade, during the parliamentary deliberations of the support scheme in the Chamber of Deputies on 31 March 2005), p. 1. *See also* Exhibit CE-34 (Press article of 12 November 2003 available at www.tzb-info.cz), p. 1 (\"Renewable sources will be supported by the Act on [Promotion], which should create a stable environment for energy producers leading to increased investment from private sources...

There is no other plausible interpretation of these unequivocal representations, made consistently and uniformly over many years, by numerous different governmental representatives in the Czech Republic.\n\n52.\n\nThe majority asserts that \"some representations [by the Czech Republic] admittedly do ambiguously mention preservation of the level of feed-in-tariffs for 15 years.\"76 That is false.\n\nAward, at para. 422.\n\n53.\n\nThe representations of the Czech Republic detailed above do not \"ambiguously\" guarantee minimum FiTs for 15 years: they unequivocally and explicitly do so, as a review of those quotations, set forth in detail above, makes clear. Likewise, it is not \"some\" representations of the Czech Republic that provide this unambiguous interpretation of Section 6(1)(b)(2): it is every single historical statement by the Czech Republic about the Act which is in the record that does so.\n\n54.\n\nNotably, the majority does not quote or address the language of the numerous governmental statements (quoted above at length) or make any effort to explain the repeated and specific references in these various statements to \"feed-in tariffs,\" \"prices,\" \"Feed-in Guarantee Price,\" \"tariffs,\" \"revenue,\" \"Minimum Purchasing Price,\" \"buy-out prices,\" or \"revenue per electricity unit.\" All of these phrases unambiguously refer to the amount of the FiTs for electricity, not merely to return of investments or profits. All of these phrases expressly reiterate, and reinforce, the specific language of Section 6(1)(b)(2) - making it clear that the Act on Promotion provided a statutory guarantee that fixed minimum FiTs would be paid for 15 (later, 20) years from the commissioning of a renewable energy source. It is gain telling that the majority provides no reasoned response to this consistent record of statements by the Czech Republic.\n\n55.\n\nThe majority asserts in passing that these multiple statements \"contain no details of the level of the FIT that is guaranteed.\"77 That is again flatly wrong.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n56.\n\nThe FiT that the Czech Republic assured investors as being \"guaranteed,\" \"maintained,\" \"preserved,\" \"fixed\" or \"applied\" for years was - obviously - the FiT that was established at the beginning of the statutory 15-year period, when a renewable energy source was commissioned. Again, that is crystal clear from the Czech Republic\u2019s repeated assurances of \"the guarantee of revenue per unit of electricity produced over a 15-year period *as of the date a plant is put into operation.* \"preservation of the level of feed-in tariffs for 15 years for plants already *in operation*,\" \"fixed purchase (feed-in-prices),\" a \"guarantee... that the amount of revenues per unit of produced electricity... will be maintained for a period of 15 years *from bringing the installation into operation,\"* \"a fifteen year guaranteed of minimum purchase prices *from the date of bringing the installation into operation,\"* a guarantee that \"[f]eed-in tariffs... shall apply throughout the *entire expected lifetime of the facility,\"* and \"[t]he amount of the feed-in tariffs is guaranteed for period of 15 years.\" The majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act - as allowing reductions of the FiTs during the statutory 15-year period - is wholly impossible to reconcile with these unequivocal statements by the Czech Republic.\n\n57.\n\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act also contradicts other unequivocal statements by the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic itself specifically acknowledged in this arbitration that the text of Section 6(1)(b)(2) required that the Purchasing Price fixed by the ERO be maintained for a 15-year period following commissioning of a Renewable Source. Thus, the Czech Republic conceded that the *\"FITs granted upon commissioning... were to remain constant,* except for an (upward) annual adjustment based on the producer price index of industrial producers (the \"PPI\"), for a period of 15 years from the commissioning of the relevant plant.\"78 Remarkably, despite that concession and the plain language of the Act, the majority interprets Section 6(1) to mean exactly the opposite, effectively reading Section 6(1)(b)(2) out of the statute, in contradiction to the Czech Republic\u2019s interpretation of its own law.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 30 (emphasis added). *See* Transcript, Day 1, page 83. line 21 to page 84, line 5.\n\n58.\n\nSimilarly, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act contradicts the testimony of the Czech Republic\u2019s own representatives and witnesses in this arbitration, who expressly conceded that Section 6(1)(b)(2) contained a statutory guarantee of fixed minimum feed-in tariffs. In the words of Mr. **[REDACTED]**:\n\n\"The Act on Promotion required that, provided the investment met technical and economic benchmarks, the Subsidy level would be sufficient to receive a payback of the investment costs within 15 years. To accomplish this objective, *the Subsidy for each installation was to be fixed at the date of commissioning for a period of at least 15 years, subject to an annual adjustment for inflation.\"79*\n\n\"[Counsel for Claimant]: And if I may, I will read it out to you what Section 6(b).2 says: \u2018After the date of the effect of this act, the amount of revenues stays unchanged for the unit of electricity from Renewable Sources with the support of buy-out prices for the period of 15 years since the year when the device was put into operation as a minimum amount.\u2019...

Respondent\u2019s witness Mr. **[REDACTED]** went on to confirm that because said guarantee was contained in a legislative act, which is published in the collection of laws, it was publicly available to everyone, including investors, *see* Transcript Day 2, page 253, line 19 to page 254, line 15 (\"[Counsel for Claimant): And if I may. 1 will read it out to you what Section 6(b).2 says: 'After the date of the effect of this act, the amount of revenues stays unchanged for the unit of electricity from Renewable Sources with the support of buy-out prices for the period of 15 years since the year when the device was put into operation as a minimum amount.\u2019...

Again, it is impossible to reconcile these explanations with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act, much less to reconcile the majority\u2019s disregard for the Czech Republic\u2019s acknowledgements about the meaning of its own legislation, with the Tribunal\u2019s mandate.\n\n60.\n\nThe majority also suggests that the Claimants may not have reviewed various of the numerous representations made by Czech governmental representatives regarding Section 6(1)(b)(2) (with the award referring to the Explanatory Note on the Act on Promotion).83 That is again wrong, both factually and legally.\n\nAward, at paras. 421 and 423.\n\n61.\n\nFirst, it is uncontroverted that the Claimants, like many other investors, did rely on some of the numerous governmental representations identified above.84 Given the very public character of those representations, and the frequency with which they were repeated, that is hardly surprising.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 30-71. **[REDACTED]** Witness Statement, para. 22 (\"None of these measures, however, were sufficient to prevent the geometric increase in installed solar capacity, as investors, most of them domestic, and many of them with no prior experience in the solar sector, *rushed to take advantage of what was widely perceived as an opportunity to earn very high profits.\")* (emphasis added); Transcript, Day 1. page 167, lines 12-21 (\"[Counsel for Respondent]: You indicated earlier in response to a question from your counsel that the yield of the investment was the determining factor, I think you said, something like that. So, this means that the anticipated rate of return on any investment in the Czech Republic was the critical aspect for you; correct? [Wirtgen]: The yield was--for us, was the reason for taking the overall risk that I just described, and it consisted of several factors. It was the decisive factor for us to consider this investment step.\"): Transcript, Day, 1, page 130, lines 4-8 (\"*[T]his well-intentioned approach effectively resulted in investors taking advantage of it* to pile on as quickly as possible, and so the problem skyrocketed in 2011, effectively by adopting a prospective change that was going to take effect almost a year later.\") (Mr. Evseev) (emphasis added).\n\n62.\n\nMore fundamentally, these representations arc significant because they provide public confirmation by the Czech Republic of the meaning of statutory instruments, and specifically Section 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion.85 The majority\u2019s suggestion that an investor cannot rely on a state\u2019s public statements about the meaning of its own legislation is impossible to reconcile with either common sense or the rule of law.\n\nThe representations here were not ad hoc statements about the exercise of governmental discretion or the treatment of a particular investor.\n\n63.\n\nA state\u2019s explanation of its legislative enactments plays a vital role in ensuring and furthering the rule of law in a democracy; those explanations are routinely relied upon, therefore, in the interpretation of legislation in adjudicative proceedings86 and in the public\u2019s understanding of the meaning of such legislation.87 The majority\u2019s suggestion that the Claimants cannot similarly rely upon such representations by the Czech Republic about the meaning of its own legislation is impossible to accept as a matter of principle. And, as discussed above, those representations make it crystal clear that Section 6 of the Act means precisely what its text provides - and precisely the opposite of what the majority asserts.\n\nThese statements form part of any legislation\u2019s drafting history, which may be described as \"the surrounding corpus of public knowledge relative to [the Act\u2019s] introduction into Parliament as a Bill, subsequent progress through, and ultimate passing by, Parliament,\" FRANCIS BENNION, Bennion ON STATUTORY INTERPRETATION (6th ed. 2013), Section 230. Although the interpretative weight courts accord to such extrinsic sources varies across jurisdictions, judicial reliance on legislative history constitutes an extended practice, *see* Robert J.

V.* v. *Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL Award, 26 June 2009, paras. 252-253, for the proposition that the Claimants cannot rely on the Czech Republic\u2019s public explanations of the Act on Promotion. Although omitted from the majority\u2019s quotations of the *Invesmart* award, the tribunal there dealt only with a claimant\u2019s effort to rely on \"the content of *internal governmental discussions,\"* not public explanations and assurances about the meaning of legislation. *Ibid.,* at para. 253 (emphasis added). Moreover, contrary to the majority\u2019s reasoning, the *Invesmart* award concluded that even internal governmental discussions could \"confirm a claimed expectation.\"\n\n64.\n\nThe majority also refers in passing to decisions of the Czech Constitutional Court and the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, assertedly reaching \"similar conclusions to those of the majority.\"88 As the majority appears to accept, these domestic decisions are of no weight in determining whether Section 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion\" provided a guarantee of a minimum FiT for purposes of the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment protection. Rather, the Tribunal has an independent mandate, and obligation, under international law to apply the Treaty in light of the Act\u2019s provisions.89\n\nAward, at para. 370.\n\n*See ZACHARY* DOUGLAS, THE INTERNATIONAL Law OF INVESTMENT CLAIMS (paperback ed. 2012), pp. 81 *et seq.* (\"The law applicable to the issue of liability for a claim upon an investment treaty obligation is the investment treaty as supplemented by general international law.... Investment treaty obligations are formulated as general concepts of minimum investment protection standards. Those concepts are not controversial because they are formulated at such a general level of abstraction. In defending an investor\u2019s claim based upon the fair and equitable treatment, a state does not insist that foreign investments should be treated unfairly and inequitably. There is, in other words, no dispute that the state must conform to a fair and equitable standard of treatment in its conduct in respect of the foreign investment. The concept itself is not controversial: rather it is the application of that concept to the circumstances of the specific case. What the parties argue about, and what the tribunal must ultimately decide, is the particular conception of the fair and equitable standard of treatment that must be applied to the case.... [I]n arriving at a conception of the investment treaty protection standards, the tribunal must inevitably have recourse to general international law and conventional international law for otherwise it would be interpreting the legal standards into the void.\").\n\n65.\n\nIn any event, the majority also fundamentally mischaracterizes the nature and content of the Czech Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment. That judgment provides no support for the majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 6 of the Act, and instead plainly contradicts the majority\u2019s construction.\n\n66.\n\nIn the judgment on which the majority relies, the Czech Constitutional Court did not reach \"similar conclusions to those of the majority,\"90 i.e., that \"the Czech Republic promised that the buy-out price or FIT would be set at a level ensuring a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment or profit over 15 years for those solar plants that met the relevant parameters.\"91 There is nothing in the Czech judgment that adopts such a statutory interpretation of Section 6 of the Act - as the absence of any quotation in the award supporting the majority\u2019s analysis suggests.\n\nAward, at para. 370.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* at para. 369.\n\n67.\n\nOn the contrary, the judgment of the Czech Constitutional Court makes it clear that the Court held - as a matter of Czech constitutional law - that the expectations of renewable energy suppliers for fixed minimum FiTs for a 15-year period did \"not attain the intensity of a constitutional-law issue.\"92 Thus, the Czech Court\u2019s judgment states that the issue presented to, and decided by, the Court \"involve[d] a challenge of constitutionality of a law, that does not interfere with constitutionally protected rights and freedoms but which *has the effect of reducing the state support stipulated in an earlier law...*.\"93 In response to this question, the Court concluded that \"although the enactment of the challenged provisions *reduced the support provided to operators of PVPP,...* this did not constitute interference that would cause a breach of the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of the affected entities.\"94 In the Court\u2019s view, \"a simple payback period on investment of 15 years\" does not violate the Czech Constitution.95\n\nExhibit R-84 (Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, 15 May 2012, Ref. No. PI. US 17/11), para. 87.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* para. 77 (emphasis added).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 90 (emphasis added).\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* para. 71.\n\n68.\n\nThis conclusion is in no way an interpretation of Section 6 \"similar\" to that of the majority - that is, as not guaranteeing minimum FiTs for 15 years. There is no analysis of the statutory text, history or purposes of Section 6 by the Czech Constitutional Court that adopts or that would support such an interpretation of the Act. The Czech Constitutional Court\u2019s decision is instead a conclusion that changes in the Czech regulatory regime - specifically, \"the enactment of the challenged provisions [which] reduced the support provided to operators\" of solar plants - did not violate the Czech Constitution.96 This is a conclusion about the meaning of the Czech Constitution and its constitutional protections for private parties, not an endorsement of the majority\u2019s statutory interpretation of Section 6 of the Act on Promotion.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* para. 90 (emphasis added).\n\n69.\n\nOn the contrary, the Czech Constitutional Court\u2019s judgments clearly contradict the interpretation of the Act suggested by the majority. Thus, the Czech Court expressly recognizes - contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis - that the Solar Levy \"has the effect of *reducing the state support stipulated in an earlier law,\"97* namely the support guaranteed by Section 6 of the Act. Likewise, the Court declared that \"the enactment of the challenged provisions *reduced the support provided to operators,\"98* Those conclusions by the Czech Constitutional Court are not \"similar\" to the majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 6. They are instead the exact opposite (just as all the other interpretations of Section 6, cited above, are also the exact opposite of the majority\u2019s view).\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* para. 77 (emphasis added).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 90.\n\n70.\n\nEach one of these statements by the Czech Constitutional Court makes clear that the Solar Levy \"has the effect of reducing the state support stipulated in an earlier law,\" and \"reduced the support provided to operators.\" Those statements manifestly recognize -contrary to the majority - that the Solar Levy deprived solar producers of the minimum FiTs guaranteed by Section 6 of the Act on Promotion. The majority\u2019s contrary suggestion is again plainly wrong.\n\n71.\n\nThe majority also refers in passing to the European Commission\u2019s asserted interpretation of the Act on Promotion.99 That reference also provides no support for the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act. The European Commission was permitted to make *amicus curiae* submissions in this proceeding only on limited issues of EU law (where the Commission has special expertise), not on other issues, such as Czech law (where the Commission has no such expertise). The Commission conducted no adjudicative proceedings, and sought no specialized expertise, in arriving at its observations about Czech law. In these circumstances, there is no reason to give the Commission\u2019s apparent views any weight, much less greater weight than the Czech Constitutional Court and Czech government.\n\nAward, at paras. 371 and 373.\n\n72.\n\nIn sum, the majority is wrong about every aspect of the Act on Promotion. Its award ignores the plain language of Sections 6(1)(b)(2) and 6(4), effectively rewriting the unequivocal text of the statute. It disregards the obvious legislative and regulatory purposes of the Act, producing an implausible result that was never imagined by Czech legislators or regulators. It ignores multiple unambiguous statements by the Czech Republic about the Act, including in this arbitration, again adopting a conclusion that was never contemplated. Simply put, the majority rewrites the Act to serve its own purposes - not to faithfully interpret what the Act was really intended and understood to mean.\n\n73.\n\nThe majority does not dispute, however, that the Solar Levy reduced the level of the FiTs payable to the Claimants and other investors in solar power plants. In the majority\u2019s words, \"while the Solar Levy as a matter of law did not directly reduce the FIT, the effect is that the Claimants\u2019 revenue is reduced by the amount of the Levy.\"100 That acknowledgment is plainly correct: the Solar Levy indisputably was intended to, and did, reduce the level of the FiTs payable to investors under the Act.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* at para. 271.\n\n74.\n\nThat conclusion clearly suffices to establish a violation of the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment protection. As discussed above, Section 6 of the Act plainly guaranteed investors in renewable energy fixed minimum FiTs for a 15 (later 20) year period; the majority\u2019s contrary assertions are simply wrong. Likewise, the Solar Levy plainly deprived investors of minimum FiTs guaranteed by the Act. That constitutes a violation of the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment provisions, entitling the Claimants to compensation.\n\n75.\n\nAs discussed in detail above, international law, and Article 2(1) of the Treaty, recognizes and gives effect to the power of the Czech Republic to make binding101 internationally enforceable commitments to private parties. Where the Czech Republic makes, and then breaches, such a commitment, it violates Article 2(1)\u2019s fair and equitable treatment guarantee and international law. Here, the Czech Republic plainly provided, and then breached, guarantees of fixed minimum FiTs for the electricity produced by the Claimants\u2019 solar plants for a 15 (later 20) year period. That plainly violates the Treaty\u2019s guarantee of fair and equitable treatment entitling the Claimants to compensation.\n\n*See* paras. 6-16 above.\n\n**III. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S OTHER DEFENSES ARE WITHOUT MERIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent, but not the majority, raises a number of additional defenses to the Claimants\u2019 fair and equitable treatment claims. In my view, none of these defenses provides a basis for denying relief to the Claimants.\n\n77.\n\nFirst, the Respondent (but not the majority) relies on Section 6\u2019s reference to \"the Office\" or the ERO, reasoning that Section 6 is not directed to, and may not be relied on by, investors because it is only an instruction to the ERO.102 This analysis ignores both the text of the Act and the Czech Republic\u2019s repeated descriptions and explanations of the Act. Notably, the majority does not rely upon this reasoning.\n\n*See* Transcript, Day 1, page 84, line 22 to page 85 line 4 (\"Another important thing to remember about this [Act on Promotion], about this provision and this section, is that these are-and maybe at some point later in this Hearing we will show you the relevant clauses, but these provisions were intended as guidance or directions to the regulator about what to do with the regime. They were not open-ended promises directed to the Investor. So, it\u2019s an important distinction, I think, to keep in mind.\"); Transcript, Day 1, page 111, lines 9-17 (\"Now, we come back again to the Act on Promotion in Section 6. One important point that my colleague has alluded to, Section 6 says what ERO shall do. It says the office sha;l-and some translations are ERO shall as a reference to ERO, so it is a legislative direction to the regulator saying how does the regulator do what it does? So, the regulator is directed to set the subsidies in a way that provides a 15-year payback period on capita! expenditures.\").\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s syllogism - that Section 6 is not directed to investors, because it is an instruction to the ERO - is a classic example of a *non sequitur.* The fact that Section 6 is directed, in the first instance, to the ERO does not suggest that Section 6 is not also directed to investors. The ERO does not set tariffs under Section 6 as an abstract academic exercise o\u00edas an empty bureaucratic formality; the ERO sets tariffs under Section 6 for the very practical purpose of providing producers of electricity from renewable energy with specific minimum prices and revenues for that electricity. As its historical and commercial background make clear, the whole point of Section 6 is to regulate the prices that are paid by consumers to producers of electricity from renewable sources. The fact that Section 6 is directed, in the first instance, to the ERO reflects only the ERO\u2019s initial role in setting the long-term (15 or 20 years) tariffs for producers, and is in no way inconsistent with the provision also guaranteeing that those tariffs will, in the words of Section 6, be \"maintained as the minimum for a period of 15 years.\"\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Section 6 - as not being directed to investors - is also impossible to reconcile with either logic or the commercial purposes of the Act on Promotion. That interpretation produces an implausible, commercially-nonsensical regulatory regime that frustrates the most fundamental purpose of the Act - namely, to provide assurances to investors and lenders in the renewable energy sector.\n\n80.\n\nThat is confirmed by the title of Section 6, which makes clear that the provision addresses the \"Amounts of Prices for Electricity from Renewable Sources and Amounts of Green Bonuses.\" The provision is not directed merely to the ERO\u2019s authority, or the formal terms of the tariffs that the ERO sets, but instead to the fundamental, and commercially-decisive, question of the \"amounts of prices\" that will be paid to producers of electricity from renewable energy sources. That text is precisely consistent with the obvious commercial and regulatory purposes of the Act (and precisely inconsistent with the Respondent\u2019s implausible construction of the statute).\n\n81.\n\nIndeed, considered carefully, the Act on Promotion\u2019s approach to FiTs - by providing for the ERO to set such tariffs based on a legislative requirement that FiTs be maintained at a minimum level for 15 years \u2014 underscored the Czech Republic\u2019s.commitment to the guaranteed levels of Purchasing Prices. The requirement that the ERO - - an independent regulatory authority - fix tariffs enhanced the stability and reliability of the tariff-setting process, by insulating it from political and similar considerations. The fact that Section 6 was directed to the ERO in the first instance therefore in no way suggests that it was less of a commitment to investors in renewable energy; this merely reflected the basic structure of the Act on Promotion and the Czech regulatory regime for electricity prices, and underscored the Czech Republic\u2019s commitment to a 15-year guaranteed minimum FiT.\n\n82.\n\nSecond, the Respondent cites a few examples of legislative provisions which prior arbitral tribunals have held to constitute stabilization guarantees, and notes aspects of those legislative provisions that are absent in the Act on Promotion in this case (for example, legislation containing statements that provisions \"may not be unilaterally modified by law...\" or that \"modifications will not affect the investment receiving companies [whose] tax stability is protected\").103 That analysis is also flawed.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Presentation, slides 22 and 23 (citing *Noble Energy* v. *Ecuador* and *Duke* v. *Peru).*\n\n83.\n\nNone of the awards cited by the Respondent suggested that the presence of the particular language which the Respondent relies upon was necessary for a conclusion that the statutory provision constituted a stabilization guarantee. Instead, these awards all formulated the standards for an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations expansively, without reliance on the particular formulae cited by the Respondent.104 Likewise, other investor-state awards also frame the inquiry into legitimate expectations more broadly, without imposing any form requirement of the sort demanded by the Respondent; instead, these awards expressly contemplate the possibility that stabilization guarantees may arise from statutory text because, as with the Act on Promotion, that text guarantees specific treatment for a prescribed time period.105\n\n*Noble Energy/, Inc. and Machalapower Cia. Ltda. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 5 March 2008, para. 162.

Republic of Lebanon,* Award, ICSID Case No ARB/07/12, 7 June 2012, para. 159; El *Paso Energy International Company* v. *The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, para. 364; *LG&E Energy Corp el al v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, para. 125. *See also* JAMES CRAWFORD, *Treaty and Contract in Investment Arbitration,* 24(3) ARBITRATION INTERNATIONAL 351 (2008), p. 369 (\"In the absence of *express stabilization,* investors take the risk that the obligations of the host State under its own law may change\") (emphasis added).\n\n84.\n\nThis well-settled approach to fair and equitable treatment makes perfect sense (but is incompatible with an insistence on particular statutory formulae). The touchstone for analysis is not the presence or absence of particular formulae in statutory provisions. Instead, the fair and equitable treatment doctrine requires addressing the more straightforward question whether an investor could reasonably understand (that is, legitimately expect) that the state had guaranteed particular treatment for a specified time period. Where the answer to that question is in the affirmative, then a fair and equitable treatment guarantee will ordinarily protect the investor\u2019s expectations.\n\n85.\n\nThere is no room in this analysis for the type of form requirement suggested by the Respondent, demanding that a statutory stabilization guarantee contain text specifically stating that legislative treatment has been \"stabilized.\" Such a form requirement is unsupported by any prior authority, either in the form of arbitral awards or commentary. A form requirement like that demanded by the Respondent is also inconsistent with the basic character of the fair and equitable treatment doctrine,106 which focuses on substance, not form, equity, not formalism, and fairness, not formulae.\n\n*See* paras. 6-10 above.\n\n86.\n\nWhen one focuses on substance and fairness, it is clear that Article 6(1)(b)(2) constitutes a statutory stabilization guarantee of a minimum FiT for the 15 (or 20) year period specified by Czech law. As discussed above, that is what the text of Article 6(1)(b)(2) plainly means when it provides that the Purchasing Price for electricity from renewable energy sources will be *\"maintained as the minimum* for a period of 15 years,\" subject only to the possibility of upward (not downward) adjustment of the price for inflation. It is also what the Czech government plainly meant when it repeatedly referred to the Article 6(1)(b)(2) FiTs as a *\"long-term guarantee of feed-in tariffs,\"* \"an unprecedented system of support in the form of *fixed purchase (feed-in) prices,\"* \"a fifteen-year *guarantee of minimum purchase prices,\"* \"the *fifteen-year guarantee of amount of revenues* for electricity,\" \"[providing that the] *amount of the feed-in tariffs is guaranteed for period of 15 years,\"* and *\"[t]ariffs are guaranteed.\"*\n\n87.\n\nThese representations explicitly addressed the level of feed-in tariffs, not an investor\u2019s rate of return or profitability. These representations were unequivocal guarantees to investors (as the majority\u2019s own analysis of Section 6(1)(b)(1) acknowledges). The language of these representations, like the text of Section 6(1)(b)(2) could not be any clearer.107\n\nI also dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusions regarding the Treaty\u2019s umbrella clause (in Article 7(2)) and full protection and security protection (in Article 4(1)). In each case, the majority\u2019s decision rests on the conclusion that the Czech government did not provide guarantees of minimum FiTs to the Claimants. As discussed in text, that conclusion is, in my view, incorrect.\n\n88.\n\nFinally, the Respondent also contends that regulatory framework for solar PV energy in the Czech Republic was in a state of flux, and therefore that the Claimants should have expected that further changes in the regulatory framework were likely. Notably, the majority again does not appear to accept this argument. In my view, that is because the argument ignores the relevant regulatory actions and governmental statements of the Czech Republic during the decisive time period.\n\n89.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, statements and actions by the Czech government in 2009 and 2010 should have led the Claimants to conclude that the solar PV regulatory framework was imbalanced and that changes were forthcoming. The Respondent cites various statements by various Czech governmental sources between August 2009 and July 2010, supposedly indicating that the Claimants knew, or should have known, that that changes in FiTs were a possibility.\"108\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Presentation, slides 55-61.\n\n90.\n\nPreliminarily, it is important to distinguish analytically between two distinct questions, which the Respondent conflates. First, and as addressed above, did the Act on Promotion provide a guarantee of fixed minimum FiTs (or, put differently, a stabilization undertaking or commitment)? Second, assuming that the Act on Promotion did provide such a guarantee, should the Claimants here have expected this guarantee to be unilaterally withdrawn or abrogated? The Respondent\u2019s analysis confuses these two issues and, as discussed below, arrives at the wrong conclusion with respect to the latter, as well as the former.\n\n91.\n\nIn my view, the Respondent\u2019s description of Czech governmental statements and actions regarding FiTs for renewable energy sources in 2009 and 2010 is inaccurate. In fact, a careful review of the full evidentiary record demonstrates the opposite of what the Respondent asserts - - namely, that the Czech government was aware of the expected imbalances in the renewable energy sector, but repeatedly reiterated from mid-2009 until October 2010 that the FiTs for existing renewable energy sources would not be changed and that changes to address the regulatory imbalances would be directed only to renewable energy sources that were commissioned in the future.109 Far from undermining the Claimants\u2019 case, this directly supports it, confirming that the FiTs for their investments were, as Section 6(1)(b)(2) provided, guaranteed for a 15 (and later, 20) year period.\n\nIn his \"Conclusion on challenges across Europe and PV subsidies,\" the Respondent\u2019s expert offers an explanation for the reason the Czech government could have been tempted not to disclose Its intentions of applying tariff adjustments to existing renewable installations. Wynne Jones First Report, p. 59, at para. 5.50 (\"If [policymakers and regulators] attempt to introduce prospective reductions to the feed in tariff or a tariff mechanism that automatically responds to installed capacity, this will cause PV investors to rush in to qualify their projects under the existing scheme, thereby exacerbating the very problem that the change is trying to solve. Policymakers and regulators simply do not have the option of implementing a smooth adjustment to tariffs or telling investors In advance.\").\n\n92.\n\nIt is important to consider carefully precisely what the Czech Republic said and did during the relevant time period (from mid-2009 to late 2010):\n\na. On 24 August 2009, the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade announced for the first time its intention to seek amendments to the Act on Promotion to reduce incentives for solar energy. The Ministry proposed doing so because of concerns that too many solar installations were being planned and that this would result in a financial burden on the Czech Republic (which, as discussed above, had guaranteed the FiTs payable to such installations). Importantly, in addressing a reduction in incentives for solar energy, the Ministry directed its attention only to the so-called 5% brake rule in Section 6(4) of the Act on Promotion, which it proposed abolishing prospectively (in January 2010), while also making it clear that the proposed changes would not affect the 15-year guarantee of minimum FiTs for existing solar facilities.110 Thus, while expecting imbalances in the renewable energy sector, the Ministry\u2019s proposal was directed only to the level of guaranteed minimum FiTs for *future* solar installations, not for *existing* solar installations.\n\nb. The day after the Ministry of Industry and Trade\u2019s 24 August announcement, the Ministry\u2019s press department clarified the limited scope of the proposed changes in an interview published in a Czech newspaper *(Pr\u00e1vo)* explaining that \"the payback period of the investment will be guaranteed, specifically by *a guarantee which is already included in the law saying that the investment in the solar system has to be paid off within 15 years.\"111* There was again no suggestion by the Ministry that the guaranteed FiTs for existing solar installations under Section 6(1)(b)(2) would be affected.\n\nc. A letter from the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the ERO of 28 August 2009 confirmed the Ministry\u2019s intention to preserve the treatment of existing solar installations, explaining that this was motivated in part by concerns about claims by existing investors in renewable energy. According to the Ministry, \"the goal of section 6(4)... was to ensure the investors in renewable sources *certainty of payback of their investments, transparency, and predictability.* A simple cancellation could thus entail a *risk of suits filed by investors against the Czech Republic on grounds of lost investments.\"112* Again, the Ministry was at pains to emphasize that the rights of existing investors would not be affected by any amendments to the Act on Promotion, which would entail only a prospective amendment to Section 6(4)\u2019s 5% brake rule.\n\nd. In September 2009, the ERO wrote an open letter to the Czech Chamber of Deputies, citing delays in the introduction of any legislative changes to Section 6(4)\u2019s 5% brake rule and again explaining that any amendments to the FiTs would only affect energy sources commissioned after \"7 *January/ 2011*,\"113 The ERO noted that this delay would enable solar investors that were already in the process of completing investments *\"to prepare sufficiently in advance for the change in the conditions for investing which should eliminate entirely the risk of possible lawsuits in the Czech Republic regarding protection of investments.\"114*\n\ne. Adopting the ERO\u2019s recommendations, the Czech government proposed an amendment to the Act on Promotion in November 2009. The Explanatory Report to that Draft Act 137/2010 once more made clear the Czech government\u2019s commitment to preserving the statutorily-guaranteed treatment of solar installations that had already been commissioned. The Report stated that one of the aims of \"[t]he proposed wording...[was] to enable the [ERO] to adjust the prices for solar power... *as of 1 January 2011.\"115* The Report repeated the explanation, provided in the ERO\u2019s earlier statements, that the prospective character of the amendment was intended to provide *\"[i]nvestors...[to] prepare sufficiently in advance for amendment of the conditions for investment, which should entirely eliminate the risk of potential lawsuits against the Czech Republic related to protection of investments.\"116*\n\nf. The proposed amendment to the Act on Promotion was adopted on 21 April 2010. The amendment provided only for the prospective elimination of Section 6(4)\u2019s 5% brake rule for solar facilities commissioned after 1 January 2011 (not January 2010).117 The proposed amendment did not alter the guaranteed FiTs under Section 6(1)(b)(2) for existing solar installations that had already been commissioned or that would be commissioned prior to I January 2011. The Czech Republic\u2019s witnesses confirmed, in cross-examination, that the proposed amendment (and reduced FiTs) would apply only to solar installations commissioned after 1 January 2011, and not to installations previously commissioned.118\n\ng. In February 2010, TSO and DSOs agreed on a moratorium refusing *\"new connection requests\"* for photovoltaic installations.119 The moratorium was intended to address the expected regulatory imbalance in the renewable energy sector, but only affected new installations, not existing investments. This was confirmed by the Czech Republic\u2019s witnesses: \"It was already\u2014in February 2010 there was a Moratorium on grid connection, so no more *new connections* for approval to the grid were being issued. There were still some speculative connections that had been issued in the past that were sort of bought and sold in the market, and that\u2019s why a lot of the Parties were able to commission plants notwithstanding the Moratorium.\"120\n\nh. In July 2010, the Czech Republic\u2019s 2010 Action Plan (submitted to the EU) stated that *\"[t]ariffs are guaranteed according* to the following table,\" listing a *\"Feed-in price guarantee (in* years)\" for photovoltaic sources as *\"20 [years].\"121* The same document contained various further assurances to existing solar investors.122 There was no suggestion that the FiTs which had been guaranteed for existing investors would be changed, notwithstanding the Czech government\u2019s awareness of imbalances in the renewable energy sector.\n\ni. In September 2010, the Czech government again considered legislation that would have reduced the burden of subsidies for renewable energy. In connection with proposed legislation addressing the issue, an Explanatory Report confirmed again that changes to FiTs would only take effect with respect to solar installations commissioned after \"1 January 2011.\" The Report also made clear that the proposed legislation would not be applicable to \"[p]hotovoltaic power plants *already connected to the electric power system\"* and that the investors\u2019 *\"right to claim support [would be]preserved under existing conditions.\"123* Furthermore, the government explicitly stated that \"[f]acilities *not yet connected to the electric power system but which started operation before January I, 2011 will have 12 months to be connected to the electric power system\"* and would also have *\"their right to claim support... preserved.\"124*\n\nExhibit R-175 (\"Ministry of industry and Trade will equalize the support of renewable energy sources,\" Ministry of Industry and Trade Press Release (ww.mpo.cz), p. 1 (\"The Ministry of Industry and Trade is planning to change the maximum 5% limit by which the Energy Regulation Office can reduce the purchase price of electricity from renewable energy sources annually....

All of the Claimants\u2019 investments were made at a time when Section 6(1)(b)(2) explicitly guaranteed fixed minimum feed-in tariffs, when the Czech Republic had repeatedly reiterated that guarantee in its public statements and when steps had been taken to address concerns about expected imbalances in the renewable energy sector, but without in any way questioning the rights of existing solar energy installations under Section 6(1)(b)(2) (or otherwise).125 In these circumstances, it is impossible to see why the Claimants were not entitled to rely on the Czech Republic\u2019s legislative, regulatory and other assurances guaranteeing the levels of feed-in tariffs for their investments.\n\nRespondent\u2019s witness Mr. **[REDACTED]** specified at the Hearing that, in 2009, investors, including the Claimants, whose Struharov plant had already been commissioned at that time, could not possibly have foreseen the enactment of the Solar Levy in 2009 - only the abolition of the 5% brake rule, *see* Transcript, Day 2, page 269, line 15 to page 270, line 9 (\"[Counsel for Claimant]: I would like to take you to Paragraph 19 of your Witness Statement.....

These minutes were, however, not made public and the first draft of Act 402/2010 submitted by the Czech government to the Chamber of Deputies on 14 October 2010 did not contain the disputed provisions, see Exhibit R-212 (Minutes of the 2nd Meeting of the Coordination Committee for the assessment of the impact of support of renewable energy sources on electricity prices), pp. 7-8; Exhibit R-84 (Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, 15 May 2012, Ref.

A prudent investor could not have foreseen any retroactive measure because he has not the insight enough to see these changes in the near future, and I think that only the Government and the regulator have had this level of insight.\" Transcript, Day 2, page 310. lines 17-23.\n\n95.\n\nGiven this history, I sec no factual basis for the Respondent\u2019s conclusion that the Czech government\u2019s statements and actions should have led the Claimants to conclude that the solar PV regulatory framework was imbalanced and that changes were forthcoming. Contrary to the Respondent\u2019s suggestion, none of these statements and actions should have led the Claimants to conclude that the guaranteed FiTs for solar installations that had already been commissioned (or would be commissioned before 1 January 2011) would be withdrawn or reduced. In fact, the Czech government had repeatedly said exactly the opposite - namely, that various steps had been taken to address excess solar capacity in the future, but that guaranteed minimum FiTs for existing facilities would be maintained.\n\n96.\n\nNone of the sources cited by the Respondent does anything to alter this conclusion. Those sources said only that FiTs for *future* solar installations would be reduced, while FiTs for *existing* installations would be maintained.129 Those statements do not support, but instead contradict, the Respondent\u2019s submissions on this point.\n\n*See* Exhibits R-l68 (Explanatory Report to draft Decree No. 409/2009 Coll.), pp. 3-4, R-l97 (\"Legislative environment and the promotion of the electricity produced from photovoltaic power plants in 2009.\" ERO Presentation), R-178 (\"Photovoltaic power plants - installed capacity in 2009, preliminary estimate,\" Czech RE Agency) and R-175 (\"Ministry of Industry and Trade will equalize the support of renewable energy sources,\" Ministry of Industry and 'Trade Press Release).\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent also criticizes the Claimants\u2019 due diligence, asserting that it was inadequate and that the Claimants easily could have discovered that... significant changes to the RES Scheme and the tax regime were likely if they had performed adequate due diligence.130 In my view, this analysis is unsustainable, both legally and factually.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 169 and 172.\n\n98.\n\nFirst, it is not the role of the Tribunal to pass abstract judgment on the quality of the Claimants\u2019 due diligence. Due diligence is only relevant if it would have provided the Claimants with information that contradicted their asserted expectations. If due diligence inquiries by the Claimants would only have confirmed the fixed minimum FiTs that the Act on Promotion, and other Czech governmental statements outlined above, guaranteed, then the failure to have conducted that due diligence is irrelevant.\n\n99.\n\nDue diligence is not a condition to protection of an investment under international law, whether under the fair and equitable treatment standard or otherwise. What is sometimes referred to as an obligation to conduct due diligence is relevant only where particular inquiries would have led an investor to alter its expectations about national law protections.131 An investor is under no abstract duty to conduct due diligence.\n\n*Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Ply Ltd* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016, para. 506 (\"The scope of the due diligence depends on the particular circumstances of each case, such as the general business environment, and includes ensuring that a proposed investment complies with local laws, as well as investigating the reliability of a business partner and that partner's representations before deciding to invest \"). *See also MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A.* v. *Republic of Chile,* Award, ICSID Case No ARB/01/17, 25 May 2004, para. 178.\n\n100.\n\nThis absence of an investor\u2019s abstract duty to conduct a legal due diligence prior to making an investment has recently been highlighted by the *Isolux* tribunal:\n\n\"[A]n investor cannot be required to conduct an extensive legal investigation. To determine whether the expectations invoked by the investor are reasonable, key elements are what every prudent investor needs to know about the regulatory framework before investing and the actual information held by an investor.... In particular, a legitimate investor expectation cannot be induced by a regulatory framework when the investor\u2019s actual information allowed him to foresee and anticipate the unfavorable development of this regulatory framework before making the investment. In order to breach the legitimate expectations of the investor, the new regulatory measures should not have been foreseeable, either by a prudent investor or by an investor who, by reason of his personal situation, had specific reasons to foresee those measures.\"132\n\n*Iso/ux Netherlands. BV v. Kingdom of Spain,* SCC Case V2013/153, Final Award, 17 July 2016, para. 781 (free translation).\n\n101.\n\nHere, as discussed above, due diligence by the Claimants would have shown nothing more than what Section 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion, and the Czech Republic\u2019s multiple representations, made clear: Solar installations commissioned in 2010 would be guaranteed to receive the FiTs prescribed for 2010 by the ERO. As also discussed above, a careful review of the Czech government\u2019s statements between January 2009 and October 2010 would have provided no investor with sound reasons to doubt the Czech Republic\u2019s commitments. As a consequence, the Respondent\u2019s claims about the \"adequacy\" of the Claimants\u2019 due diligence is irrelevant as a matter of principle.\n\n102.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent\u2019s factual assessment of the Claimants\u2019 due diligence is flawed. In particular, the Respondent ignores, or distorts, the due diligence conducted by the Claimants prior to making their investments in the Czech energy sector.\n\n103.\n\nPreliminarily, the Claimants\u2019 investments in this case were not particularly large by the standards of many cross-border investments - involving an aggregate amount of some **[REDACTED]** million euros spread across several different installations.133 In these circumstances, the type of due diligence that is appropriate differs significantly from larger investments. International law protects small investments as well as large ones; equally, neither international law nor the drafters of bilateral investment treaties condition investment protection on unrealistic or uncommercial requirements. Any criticism of the Claimants\u2019 due diligence must take both the nature of their investments, and the clarity of the Czech government\u2019s commitments, into account.134\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 110.\n\n*Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016, para. 506.\n\n104.\n\nMoreover, it is undisputed that the Claimants retained legal advisers in the Czech Republic to advise them specifically regarding the investments at issue in this arbitration and to provide them with formal written legal advice about the stability of the Czech regulatory regime.135 That is hardly a lack of due diligence, particularly in the context of the investments that the Claimants were making. That is particularly true given that the Claimants were investing in a Member State of the European Union, in a legal environment promising certainty, stability and the rule of law.136\n\nExhibit CE-54 (Legal opinion concerning the duration of power feed-in remuneration when erecting photovoltaic systems in the Czech Republic by Ueltzhoffer Balada, 2009).\n\nThe Copenhagen criteria set out in 1993, now embodied in Arts. 2 and 49 of the Treaty on European Union, explicitly require for European Union membership \"that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, *the rule of law,* human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.\" *See* Copenhagen European Council - 21-22 June 1993, Conclusions of the Presidency, p. 13, available at http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/conclusions/1993-2003/ (last visited 11 June 2017). In accordance with the commitment to the rule of law it requires from its Member States, the European Union suggests in its \"Guidance for renewables support schemes\" that \"unannounced or retroactive changes to support schemes should be avoided as they undermine investor confidence and prevent future investment.\" available at http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/support-schemes (last visited 11 June 2017).\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the legal advice obtained by the Claimants regarding their investments, on the grounds that the opinion was only a one and half page due diligence report, prepared by a German lawyer who was not licensed to advise on Czech law matters, and, apparently, that the opinion was (or might be) incorrect. This criticism is mistaken.\n\n106.\n\nThe evidence shows that the legal advice obtained by the Claimants was prepared by a law firm located in the Czech Republic that was fully licensed to practice Czech law and to provide legal advice in the Czech Republic.137 The law firm\u2019s advice was signed by a German lawyer because the advice - for a German client - was in German, but the advice remained advice about Czech law from a Czech law firm. The Respondent\u2019s criticism of the Claimants\u2019 action in this regard is unwarranted (and would come as a surprise to the numerous lawyers around the world who practice, successfully and constructively, outside their home jurisdictions).\n\nExhibit CE-96 (Letter from Ueltzhoffer to Mr. **[REDACTED]** of 18 August 2015), para. 9.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent also impliedly criticizes the length of the legal advice obtained by the Claimants. Again, that criticism ignores the context and magnitude of the Claimants\u2019 investments and the substance of the advice received, while instead imposing unrealistic and artificial requirements on practical advice provided in the ordinary course of business affairs. Investment arbitration awards may run to hundreds of pages, but that provides neither guidance for practical business counsel nor a model of good practice for commercial advisers.\n\n108.\n\nFinally, the Respondent also suggests that legal advice provided to the Claimants was wrong, on the apparent theory that it was questionable whether the principle of *\"Bestandsschutz\"* exists in Czech law. In fact, the evidence shows that Czech law does recognize the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations, including the principle cited in the Claimants\u2019 legal advice (with the Czech Constitutional Court expressly relying on that principle138). In these circumstances, criticism of the Claimants\u2019 due diligence falls particularly far from the mark. More fundamentally, it would be wrong to require the Claimants not only to conduct due diligence, but to conduct due diligence that reaches the \"right\" result. Even assuming that the Claimants\u2019 legal advisers made a mistake, much less reached a \"questionable\" conclusion, that is no grounds for denying the Claimants the protections of the Treaty or international law.\n\nExhibit R-84 (Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, 15 May 2012, Ref. No. PI. \u00daS 17/11), para. 53 (\"While true retroactivity is admissible only in exceptional cases, in the case of pseudo retroactivity it can be said that such retroactivity is generally admissible. In this case, legal theory in fact acknowledges exceptions consisting of situations where pseudo retroactivity is not admissible in view of the principle of protection of confidence in the law. Such a situation is involved if\u2018this interferes with confidence in factual circumstances and the significance of the lawmakers\u2019 wishes for the public does not outweigh, or does not attain the level of, an individual\u2019s interest in the continued existence of the existing law\u2019 (Pieroth, B. R\u00fcckwirkung und Obergangsrecht. Verfassungsrechtliche MaBstabe f\u00fcr intemporale Gesetzgebung, Berlin, 1981, pp. 380-381, c.f. also the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany dated 19 December 1961 File No. 2 BvR 1/60; BVerfGE 13,274, 278). This view is also reflected in the settled case-law of the German Federal Constitutional Court, according to which pseudo retroactivity is in compliance with the principle of protection of confidence in the law if it is suitable and necessary to achieve the objective pursued by the law and when the bounds of what is tenable are not exceeded when one weighs the \"betrayed\" confidence against the importance and urgency of the legal change (Cf. the decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court dated 7 July 2010 File No. 2 BvL 14/02, paragraph 58).\"). Confidence in the law and in the protection of acquired rights have been relied upon by the Czech Constitutional Court since its inception. *See* MAHULENA HOSKOV\u00c1, *Rechlsslaallichkeit in der Tschechischen Repubiik [Rule of Law in the Czech Republic]* in Rechtsstaatlichkeit in Europa [Rule of Law in Europe] 251 (Rainer Hoffman et al. eds. 1996), pp. 262-263.\n\n109.\n\nIn sum, the majority ignores, and effectively rewrites, the plain language of the relevant Czech legislation. It also ignores, and thereby gravely distorts, the obvious legislative and regulatory purposes of the Czech legislation, as well as the repeated, unequivocal representations of the Czech Republic, including in this arbitration, about the meaning of this legislation.\n\n110.\n\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act might be regarded by some as expedient. But that decision ultimately contradicts both the Tribunal\u2019s mandate and the rule of law, denying the Czech Act on Promotion the meaning it was manifestly intended and understood to have. In so doing, the majority not only frustrates the intentions of the Treaty and the Czech legislature, but also undermines the ability of the Czech Republic to provide meaningful legislative guarantees to investors and others in the future. Put simply, if Czech legislation can be ignored or rewritten here, then the same can happen in other cases. Neither future investors nor others will ignore that unfortunate fact. The majority\u2019s decision thus effectively deprives the Czech Republic of the ability to provide reliable legislative guarantees to investors or others in the future.\n\n111.\n\nIn doing so, the majority gravely undermines the rule of law and the authority of states to address pressing economic and social problems. It is critical, in societies governed by the rule of law, for states to have the authority to make binding commitments to private parties. The majority denies both the Czech Republic, and by analogy, other states, that ability. That betrays both the Claimants in this case and, in the long-term, the people of the Czech Republic.\n\n112.\n\nI dissent from that result."}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| Act 180 / Act on Promotion | Act No. 180/2005 Coll., on Promotion of Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources and on Amendments to Certain Laws |\n| Act 165/2012 | Act No. 165/2012 Coll., on Promotion of Sources of Energy and Amending Certain Acts |\n| Act 310/2013 | Act No. 310/2013 Coll. |\n| Act 346/2010 | Act No. 346/2010 Coll., Amending the Income Tax Act, as amended, and Other Related Acts |\n| Act 586/1992 / Income Tax Act Amicus Curiae Submission | Act 586/1992 Coll. on Income Tax EC\u2019s Amicus Curiae Submission of 11 December 2015 |\n| BIT / Treaty | Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 2 October 1990 |\n| Commission\u2019s Application | EC\u2019s Application to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party of 11 July 2014 |\n| Commission Decision | European Commission\u2019s decision of 2 December 2016 |\n| Commission\u2019s Submission | European Commission\u2019s submission of 17 February 2017 |\n| EC / Commission | European Commission |\n| ECJ | European Court of Justice |\n| ER | Expert report |\n| ERO | Energy Regulatory Office |\n| EU | European Union |\n| Exh.

MAIN FACTS**\n------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe following summary is meant to give a general overview of the present dispute. It does not include all the facts which may be of relevance, particularly as they emerged from the extensive evidence gathered at the hearing. To the extent relevant and useful, additional facts will be addressed in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n**A. BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Czech Republic came into existence on 1 January 1993 upon the dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation. It acceded to the European Union (\"EU\") on 1 May 2004.\n\n12.\n\nAs a result of the accession, the Republic was required to harmonize its legal system with EU law and transpose existing EU Directives into its national legislation.\n\n13.\n\none area where such transposition was required was the renewable energy sector. In 2001, through Directive 2001/77/EC,2 the EU had set non-binding indicative renewable energy production targets for its Member states. These targets envisaged that the share of renewable energy should be at or above 8% by 2010.3 In 2009, through Directive 2009/28/EC, these targets were raised to 13% by 2020.4\n\nExh. RLA-016, Directive 2001/77/EC.\n\nExh. C-28, Directive 2001/77/EC, Article 3.2, Annex.\n\nExh. C-29, Directive 2009/28/EC, Annex I.\n\n14.\n\nThe Czech Republic undertook to achieve an 8% share of production of electricity from renewable sources of energy (\"REs\") in its gross energy consumption by 2010.5 Discussions for devising the appropriate framework to meet this target started in 2002, even before accession. These discussions continued in 2003 and 2004 when a draft bill was prepared.\n\nExh. RLA-016, Directive 2001/77/EC.\n\n**B. SUPPORT SCHEME**\n---------------------\n\n15.\n\nIn March 2005, a \"support scheme\" for renewable energies came into effect.6 It broadly consisted of two parts: the continuation of existing tax incentives (1) and the enactment of Act 180 entitled \"on the support of Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy sources\"7 (\"Act 180\") (2).\n\nThe Claimants use the term \"support scheme\" as a collective term for Act 180, the tax exemption and the depreciation provisions of the Income Tax Act (soC, \u00a75).\n\nExh. C-31, Act 180/2005 sb on the support of Electricity Generation from Renewable sources of Energy and on Amendment of some other Acts (the Act on the support of Use of Renewable sources); Exh. R-4. The Respondent titles Act 180 as \"Act No. 180/2005 Coll., on Promotion of Electricity Production from Renewable Energy sources and on Amendments to Certain Laws\" or \"The Act on Promotion\".\n\n**1. Tax Incentives**\n---------------------\n\n16.\n\nAct No. 586/1992 Coll. on Income Taxes (the \"Income Tax Act\"),8 in force since 1993, provided specific rules for calculating the corporate income tax of producers of electricity from renewable sources of energy (\"REs producers\"). REs producers were exempt from income tax in the year the plant was put into operation and for the following five years.9 Further, the Act provided preferential depreciation periods for certain intangible assets of REs producers (the tax exemption and the preferential depreciation period are collectively referred to as \"the Tax Incentives\").\n\nExh. R-5, Act 586/1992 Coll.\n\nExh. C-30, The Income Tax Act, Part 1, section 4(1)(e) (\"Exempted from taxation shall be: [\u2026] e. revenues from [\u2026] solar facilities [\u2026] in the calendar year in which they were put into operation for the first time, and the five years immediately following.\").\n\n17.\n\nAn Explanatory Report to a draft of a legislation that eventually became Act 180 dated 12 November 2003 (the \"2003 Explanatory Report\") referred to these income tax exemptions for REs producers.\n\n**2. Act 180**\n--------------\n\n18.\n\nAct 180 was enacted on 31 March 2005 and entered into force on 1 August 2005. Act 180 supported the production of electricity from REs through a combination of tariff and non-tariff mechanisms.\n\n19.\n\nFirst, operators of the electricity grid were obliged to primarily connect facilities that generated electricity from renewable energy sources:\n\n\"The operator of the transmission system or the operators of distribution systems are obliged to primarily connect the devices according to section 3 (hereinafter referred to as the \"devices\") to the transmission system or to the distribution systems on their locality [...]\".10\n\nExh. C-31, Act 180/2005, section 4(1).\n\n20.\n\nGrid operators were also under an obligation to purchase all the electricity generated by REs producers for fixed prices or so-called feed-in tariffs:\n\n\"The operators of the local distribution systems and the operator of the transmission system are obliged to buy out every electricity from the renewable sources, to which the support applies, and to enter into the contract on supply [\u2026]\".11\n\n*Id.,* section 4(4).\n\n21.\n\nThe Act did not contemplate compensating grid operators for the feed-in tariffs (\"FITs\") which they were to pay to the REs producers. These tariffs were funded through a compulsory surcharge set by the Energy Regulatory office (the \"ERO\") in its yearly price decisions and invoiced to all electricity consumers by the grid operators as part of the electricity bill.12\n\nExh. R-031 ERO price decision No. 9/2008 of 18 November 2010; Exh. R-033 ERO price decision No. 7/2009 of 25 November 2009; Exh. R-037, ERO price decision No. 14/2005 of 30 November 2005; Exh. R-038 ERO price decision No. 9/2006 of 27 November 2006; Exh.

C-031, Act 180/2005, Section 4(3).\n\n23.\n\nEach year the ERO was to determine the rate of FITs and green bonuses for plants connected to the grid in the following year. Specific considerations were to be taken into account by the ERO while setting these tariffs, as provided in Article 6 of Act 180, for which the Parties provided different translations:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Claimants\u2019 Translation of Article 6 of Act 180 (Exh.C-031) | Respondent\u2019s Translation of Article 6 of Act 180 (Exh.R-004) |\n| Level of the prices for the electricity from the renewable sources and the green bonuses | Amounts of Prices for Electricity from Renewable Sources and Amounts of Green Bonuses |\n| (1) The Authority defines the buy-out prices for the electricity from the renewable sources (hereinafter referred to as the \"buy-out prices\") separately for individual types of the renewable sources and the green bonuses always for the calendar year in advance in such way that | (1) The Office sets, one calendar year in advance, the purchasing prices for electricity from Renewable Sources (the \"Purchasing Prices\"), separately for individual kinds of Renewable Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that |\n| a) the conditions are created for the fulfilment of the indicative target of the share of the generation of the electricity from the renewable sources in the gross consumption of | a) the conditions are created for the achievement of the indicative target so that the share of electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| electricity from the renewable sources on the market with the electricity. | electricity from Renewable Sources in the electricity market. |\n| (3) When defining the buy-out prices and the green bonuses, the Authority starts out from various costs for acquisition, connection and operation of individual types of devices including the time development thereof. | (3) When setting Purchasing Prices and green bonuses, the Office proceeds on the basis of differing costs for the acquisition, connection and operation of individual types of facilities, including the development thereof over time. |\n| (4) The buy-out prices defined by the Authority for the next calendar year may not be lower that 95 % of the value of the buy-out prices valid in the year, in which the new decision is to be taken.

This provision shall be used for the first time for the prices set for 2007. |\n\n24.\n\nSection 6(3) clarified that the ERO should set tariffs based on the differing installation and operating costs of different sources of RES, \"including the development [of those costs] over time\", recognizing that changes in costs over time would lead to an adjustment of the tariffs. Moreover, the FIT for electricity generated by a plant newly put into operation could not be lower than 95% of the tariff applicable to the electricity generated by the plants connected in the previous year (Section 6(4)) (so-called \"5% brake rule\"). Finally, pursuant to Public Notice No. 150/2007, the FITs would be increased annually to reflect the producers\u2019 price index, by at least 2% but no more than 4%.16\n\nExh. C-036, Public Notice 150/2007 Coll. of 19 June 2007 on price regulation in the energy sectors and on price regulation methods, Section 2(11) provides: \"[...] Throughout the lifetime of the facility producing electricity, which falls in the relevant category determined pursuant to the type of renewable source used and date of putting into operation, the feed-in tariffs shall be increased annually taking in consideration the price index of industry manufacturers at least by 2% and at maximum by 4%\".\n\n25.\n\nFurther guidance for calculating the FIT was provided by means of Decree No. 475/2005 Coll., on Implementation of Certain Provisions of the Act on Promotion of Exploitation of Renewable Energy Sources (the \"Technical Regulation\"), which established the specific technical parameters to be used by the ERO:\n\n\"In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured through the support by Purchasing Prices of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and economic parameters of an installation producing electricity from renewable sources must be satisfied, where the producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve, with the given level of Purchasing Prices\n\na) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the installation, such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and\n\nb) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero\".17\n\nExh. R-013, Decree No. 475/2005 Coll., implementing certain provisions of the law on support for the use of renewable sources (\"Technical Regulation\"), \u00a74(1).\n\n26.\n\nThe formula to calculate the net present value required by Section 4(1)(b) of the Technical Regulation and the weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") was published on the ERO\u2019s website.18 Until the end of 2010, the WACC used by the ERO in calculating the tariffs was 7% per year.19\n\nExh. R-014, ERO Methodology for Determination of Purchasing Prices and Green Bonuses.\n\n*Id*.\n\n27.\n\nAnnex 3 to the Technical Regulation specified the individual technical parameters that would be applied in calculating the FIT. These included (i) the assumed lifetime of the installation; (ii) the assumed level of efficiency of the solar panels used; (iii) the assumed investment costs per installed kilowatt peak (\"kWp\"); and (iv) the assumed annual usage in kilowatt hours of installed kWp. The levels of these parameters were set for a representative hypothetical installation and were modified as appropriate by the ERO prior to calculating tariffs for the coming year.\n\n28.\n\nThe period for which the producers would be eligible to receive the FIT calculated on the basis of Act 180 and its supporting framework was set through Public Notices:\n\no Under Public Notice No. 150/2007, the FIT was to apply \"throughout the lifetime of the facility producing electricity\";20\n\no Through Public Notice No. 475/2005, the \"lifetime of the facility producing electricity\" was set at 15 years;21\n\no Through Public Notice No. 364/2007, this period was increased to 20 years.22 The reasons for the increase were described as follows:\n\n\"[T]he lifespan of the facilities shall be modified; owing to the progress in the industry, the lifespan has increased from 15 years to 20-25 years; it is proposed to count on 20 years. However, this involves the issue of the ageing of the panels because the panel output at the end of its lifespan is not the same as its output once it is installed. This is why it is proposed to count on the year-on-year decline in the panel output by 0.8% of the nominal output per year\".23\n\nExh.

THE CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nIn 2009, Mr. [REDACTED] t, the managing director of [REDACTED], a company engaged in the search, management and operation of PV projects, approached the Claimants with investment opportunities in the Czech solar sector. With [REDACTED] \u2019s co-operation, the Claimants invested in three solar PV plants in the Czech Republic, Struharov (1), Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 (2), and Vern\u00e9rov (3).\n\n**1. Struharov**\n----------------\n\n30.\n\non 14 August 2009, [REDACTED] provided Claimants 1 and 2 with a proposal for a PV project in the municipality of Struharov.\n\n31.\n\nOn 25 August 2009, Claimant 4 purchased plots of land in the Struharov municipality through [REDACTED], a project developer. One month later, on 25 September 2009, it entered into a turnkey contract with [REDACTED] for the construction of a solar PV plant. The construction permit for the plant was subsequently issued on 27 November 2009. Thereafter, on 14 December 2009, ERO issued a license for the generation of electricity at the Struharov plant. The plant was put into service on 16 December 2009 and connected to the grid on the same day pursuant to a contract with the grid operator [REDACTED].\n\n32.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Claimants could choose to be paid for the electricity generated through a FIT or through a green bonus. The Claimants chose the former. At the time, the tariff was 12.79 CZK per kWh (EUR 0,492 per kWh) in accordance with ERO\u2019s Price Decision No. 8 of 18 November 2008 for plants commissioned in 2009.\n\n**2. Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1**\n-------------\n\n33.\n\nAfter the commissioning of the Struharov plant, Claimants 1 and 2 considered further investments in the Czech Republic. Eventually, they invested in two other PV plants along with their [REDACTED], Claimant 3.\n\n34.\n\nIn February 2010, [REDACTED] advised the Claimants that the city of Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 was seeking to sell property development rights by way of tender. The city intended to participate in the profits of a PV plant without committing capital. On 12 February 2010, [REDACTED] responded to the tender. Its bid was successful and a development contract was signed between [REDACTED] and the city of Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 on 26 March 2010. The contract provided that, besides the purchase price, the city would receive a fee [REDACTED] of the tariffs paid by the grid operator for the electricity produced.\n\n35.\n\nTwo months later, on 7 April 2010, the Claimants set up JSW Solar (zwei) k.s., a company directly owned by Claimant 4 (99.9%) and by JSW Solar (zwei) Verwaltungs GmbH (0.01%), and indirectly owned by Claimants 1, 2 and 3 who are shareholders of both companies. The development contract entered into by [REDACTED] was assigned to JSW Solar (zwei) k.s. by trilateral agreement.\n\n36.\n\nThe construction permit for the Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 plant was granted on 18 May 2010, and a turnkey contract was entered into with [REDACTED] on 26 May 2010. The license for the generation of electricity at the plant was issued by ERO on 22 September 2010. The plant was put into service on 13 October 2010 and connected to the grid on the same day.\n\n37.\n\nAs in the case of the Struharov plant, the Claimants opted for compensation in the form of FIT. At the time, the tariff was 12.15 CZK per kWh (EUR 0.48 per kWh) in accordance with ERO\u2019s Price Decision No. 5 of 23 November 2009 for plants commissioned in 2010.\n\n**3. Vern\u00e9rov**\n---------------\n\n38.\n\nWhile the investment in Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 was ongoing, the Claimants received information from [REDACTED] about a project at Vern\u00e9rov. On 28 May 2010, JSW Solar (zwei) k.s. signed a turnkey construction contract with [REDACTED] for a PV plant at that location.\n\n39.\n\nSomewhat later, on 7 July 2010, to develop the PV plant at Vern\u00e9rov, JSW Solar (zwei) k.s. together with JSW Solar (zwei) Verwaltungs-GmbH acquired all shares in FVE Verne s.r.o.24 FVE Verne s.r.o. was owned by JSW Solar (zwei) k.s. (99.9%) and by JSW Solar (zwei) Verwaltungs GmbH (0.01%), which were in turn owned by Claimants 1-3.\n\nThe project rights were held by a special purpose vehicle FVE Verne s.r.o, which was owned by another company Windenergie s.r.o.\n\n40.\n\nThe construction permit for the Vern\u00e9rov plant was granted on 20 September 2010. The license for the generation of electricity at Vern\u00e9rov was issued by ERO on 11 October 2010. The plant was put into service on 17 December 2010 and connected to the grid on the same day.\n\n41.\n\nLike for their other plants, the Claimants chose a FIT rather than a green bonus. At the time, the tariff was 12.15 CZK kWh (approximately EUR 0.48 per kWh) in accordance with ERO\u2019s Price Decision No. 5 of 23 November 2009 for plants commissioned in 2010.\n\n**D. CHANGES IN THE PV SECTOR**\n-------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent contends that a \"fundamental change\" in the global market for solar panels occurred in 2009 and 2010. The price of solar panels - which form the bulk of a producer\u2019s investment costs - fell dramatically. As the FIT was set on the basis of a higher investment costs, a \"perfect storm\" was in the making: while the investment costs of RES plants decreased substantially, the Respondent could not reduce the tariffs proportionately due to the 5% brake rule. The result, so says the Respondent, was that producers stood to earn windfall profits at the expense of the Czech consumers.\n\n43.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Respondent argues that it \"had no choice\" but to modify the Support Scheme, which it did.\n\n**E. AMENDMENTS TO THE SUPPORT SCHEME**\n---------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Support Scheme was amended on several occasions in 2009 and 2010. The principal amendments are outlined below.\n\n**1. Abolishing the 5% Brake Rule**\n-----------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nOn 21 April 2010, the Respondent enacted a first amendment of its Support Scheme through Act 137/2010, which ended the 5% brake rule. As a result, ERO could reduce the FIT by more than 5% for plants connected in the following year, i.e. 2011. This amendment did not affect the Claimants,25 other than it allegedly \"made it extremely important that [the Claimants\u2019 projects] would be concluded within 2010 in order to be entitled to the 2010 feed-in tariff\".26\n\nThe Claimants have submitted that the 5% limit is one of the \"three independent guarantees\" to which they were entitled under Act 180 (Reply, \u00a729). However, as the 5% brake rule did not apply to tariffs for existing investments, it could not impact the Claimants\u2019 investments. See also Tr. (Day 1) 31:13-15 (\"[The] 5% brake clause. Not relevant for Claimants. They managed to bring their plants online on time.\").\n\nSoC, \u00a788.\n\n**2. Limiting the Support Scheme to Small PV Plants**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nOn 3 November 2010, in Act 330/2010, the Respondent limited, as from 1 March 2011, the Support Scheme to small PV plants that had an installed capacity of up to 30 kWh. This Act, in effect from 1 January 2011, applied to all plants connected from 2011 onwards. It did not affect the Claimants\u2019 plants as these were all put into operation in 2009 (Struharov) or 2010 (Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 and Vern\u00e9rov).\n\n**3. Abolishing the Tax Incentives**\n------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nStill on 3 November 2010, through Act No. 346/2010 Coll., Amending the Income Tax Act, as amended, and Other Related Acts (\"Act 346/2010\"), the Respondent amended the Income Tax Act. More specifically, it terminated the Tax Incentives as of 1 January 2011. The reasons for the amendment were set out in the Explanatory Report accompanying Act 346/2010:\n\n\"The proposed changes are in response to the need to eliminate all legal means for the indirect support of electric power generation from renewable resources (mainly solar power plants) that is no longer justified, and therefore they are making taxation on environmentally friendly power generation sources and facilities stricter and eliminating the tax-exempt status of income from the operation of environmentally friendly power generation facilities. In order to simplify legal regulation and enable easier administration, the elimination of this exempt status for other environmentally friendly facilities has also been proposed\".27\n\nExh. R-221, Government\u2019s proposal for adoption of a bill amending Act No. 586/1992 Coll., on income tax, as amended, and other related acts.\n\n**4. Introducing the Solar Levy**\n---------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nOn 14 December 2010, the Respondent adopted Act 402/2010 Coll., (\"Act 402/2010\"),28 which limited the contribution of consumers to the RES subsidies (FIT or green bonus) to CZK 370/MWh. This created a shortfall between the funds raised from the final consumers and the amount of subsidy to be paid to RES producers. Act 402/2010 provided that this shortfall would be financed from the state budget. The state budget, consequently, needed additional revenues to fund this expenditure.\n\nExh. R-123, Act 402/2010 Coll., amending Act No. 180/2005 Coll., on promotion of electricity production from renewable energy sources (the Act on Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources), as amended, and certain other acts.\n\n49.\n\nThese additional revenues were to come from multiple sources, one of which was a 26% so-called solar levy (the \"Solar Levy\") which was introduced through Act 402/2010.29 The Solar Levy was to remain in force for a period of three years and applied to PV plants put into operation between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010:\n\n\"Subject-Matter of Levy from Electricity from Solar Radiation\n\nThe subject-matter of the levy for the electricity from the solar radiation (hereinafter referred to as the \"levy\") is the electricity generated from the solar radiation in the period of time from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 in the device that was put into operation in the period of time from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010\".30\n\nIn 2013, the Levy was reduced to 10%. See Exh. C-077, Act 310/2013.\n\nExh. C-065, Act 402/2010, Section 7(a).\n\n50.\n\nThe Solar Levy was imposed on PV producers, but was to be remitted by the grid operators:\n\n\"Persons subject to the Levy\n\n(1) The payer of the levy is the producer, if he generates the electricity from the solar radiation.\n\n(2) The payer remitting the levy is the operator of the transmission system or the operator of the local distribution system\".31\n\nExh. C-065, Act 402/2010, Section 7(b).\n\n51.\n\nThe Solar Levy was withheld at source. The grid operator continued to pay the FIT to the RES producers, but after deduction of the Solar Levy.\n\n52.\n\nA formal order providing for the deduction of the Solar Levy was never issued to the Claimants. They therefore complained about it to the grid operator [REDACTED].32 They also filed complaints with the relevant offices, but their complaints were dismissed.33 They appealed these dismissals, but later withdrew their appeals on the basis of the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court which is discussed below. The Solar Levy continues to be deducted from the monthly payments by [REDACTED] to the Claimants\u2019 plants in Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 and Vern\u00e9rov.\n\nExh. C-018, Letter from Claimants to grid operator [REDACTED] of 6 April 2011.\n\nExh. C-020, Complaint from Claimants to tax office of 29 June 2011; Exh. C-021, Decision by D\u00e9c\u00edn Tax Office of 1 July 2011.\n\n**F. CONSOLIDATION OF THE SUPPORT SCHEME AND FURTHER LEGISLATION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn 30 May 2012, the Respondent published Act 165/2012 Coll., on Promotion of Sources of Energy and Amending Certain Acts (\"Act 165/2012\"), which repealed and replaced Act 180. Act 165/2012 came into effect partly from the date of publication and partly as of 1 January 2013. It incorporated the FIT as set out in Act 180 and the Solar Levy introduced in Act 402/2010.\n\n54.\n\nAct 165 was itself amended with effect from 2 October 2013 by Act No. 310/2013 Coll. (\"Act 310/2013\"). Act 310/2013 extended the Solar Levy at a rate of 10% of the FIT for the plants commissioned in 2010 for the entire period of time during which these plants would have right to electricity support.34\n\nExh. C-077, Act 310/2013, Art. I(8)-(9) of (amending \u00a7\u00a714 and 18 of Act 165/2012).\n\n55.\n\nThe provisions of Acts 346/2010 and 402/2010 applied to all of the Claimants\u2019 plants. The prolongation of the Solar Levy under Act 310/2013 applies to the Claimants\u2019 plants in Sv\u00e9tl\u00e1 and Vern\u00e9rov.\n\n**G. DECISIONS OF THE CZECH COURTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1. Decision of the Czech Constitutional Court**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nOn 10 March 2011, a group of 20 senators (members of the upper chamber of the Czech Parliament) filed a petition with the Czech Constitutional Court asking the Court to repeal, *inter alia*, the Solar Levy. The withdrawal of the tax exemption was challenged as well. The petition was subsequently modified and supplemented on several occasions.\n\n57.\n\nThe Constitutional Court defined the legal question before it as follows:\n\n\"[W]hether there existed on the part of the affected operators of [solar plants] such a strong, constitutionally-relevant interest in the keeping of the existing stipulated-in-law price for electricity from renewable sources, and the stipulated amounts of green bonuses, without having such support curtailed by the levy, that such interest would outweigh the public interest in reducing the stipulated electricity prices\".35\n\nExh. R-084, Decision of the Constitutional Court, case no. Pl. \u00daS 17/11, 15 May 2012, \u00a756.\n\n58.\n\nOn the Solar Levy, the Court observed that under Act 180 RES producers were at most entitled to expect that their investment would be paid back in 15 years, which time was maintained despite the Solar Levy:\n\n\"The Constitutional Court consequently concurred with the conclusion that the consequence of the enactment of the parts of Act No. 402/2010 Coll. that were challenged by the petitioners consists, in the case of investors that commissioned their installations during the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010, merely of the fact that the extent of their profits was temporarily affected by the amount of the newly-introduced levy and the resulting extension of the payback period on their investment. However, the system of support and the principles for setting regulated prices, as regulated in Act No. 180/2005 Coll., continue to guarantee such conditions as to enable investors to achieve a simple payback period on investment of 15 years. In relation to the payback period, the change is merely reflected in the fact that the payback will be achieved in a longer time horizon (but one that is maintained by the act) than the producers of electricity from renewable sources had expected.\"36\n\n*Id.,* \u00a771.\n\n59.\n\nThe Constitutional Court also observed that the introduction of the Solar Levy was proportionate to the \"entirely legitimate\" objective of \"averting the social and economic impacts of a substantial rise in electricity prices for end consumers, and regulating state support in response to an extreme fall in capital expenditure costs\":37\n\n\"The means that were selected for attaining such objectives seem to be reasonable and appropriate, since as follows from the materials presented, the levy on electricity from solar radiation was set so as to continue to guarantee a fifteen year payback period on investment, the period guaranteed by the law. [T]his was not an extreme measure, the production of electricity from renewable sources continues to be subsidized to a significant extent\".38\n\n*Id.,* \u00a772.\n\n*Id.,* \u00a772.\n\n60.\n\nOn the withdrawal of the tax exemption, the Court made the following observations:\n\n\"[T]he challenged provisions responded to the need to eliminate, through the use of all legal means, the indirect support provided for the production of electricity from ecological sources, support that was no longer justified at that time, particularly as concerned solar installations, and such provisions therefore made the tax regime applicable to ecological sources and installations stricter by ending the tax exemption on income from the operation of ecological installations.\n\nThe relevant legal regulation concurrently aimed to fulfill a major public interest (that of keeping energy prices stable, keeping the public debt from rising etc.), an aim which, in the spirit of the case-law of the Constitutional Court, can be used to justify even potential interference with the legitimate expectations of taxpayers.\n\nIt is therefore evident that the reasons and objectives of the challenged legal regulation, which was used to cancel the exemption from income tax with regard to income from the operation of solar installations [\u2026] are identical to the reasons and objectives that led to the enactment of the legal regulation stipulating the levy on electricity from solar radiation, and accordingly the Constitutional Court makes reference to paragraphs [above] that fully fit this issue. For the sake of completeness, the Constitutional Court would like to add that the income tax exemption was also cancelled with regard to other ecological installations. Taxpayers could use this exemption for the last time in the tax period that commenced in 2010, which means that the change also applies to taxpayers that commissioned their ecological energy sources and installations before these amendments entered into force\".39\n\n*Id.,* \u00a7\u00a783-84.\n\n61.\n\nIn conclusion, the Court emphasized:\n\n\"The principle of legal certainty cannot be viewed as being identical to a requirement of absolute unchangeability of legal regulation, since legal regulation is subject to, among other things, social and economic changes and the requirement of ensuring that the state budget remains stable.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n[T]he Constitutional Court has not ignored the fact that it had been the state that guaranteed, by means of a law, a fifteen year payback period on investment and a certain amount of revenues per unit of electricity produced from renewable sources, thereby motivating the affected entities to undertake entrepreneurial activities in the area of energy production from renewable sources.\n\nAs was stated above, however, the Constitutional Court concurrently feels that it is legitimate for lawmakers, after objectively ascertaining that a change has occurred in the investments in PVPP, to take the step of regulating support for the production of electricity from RES, to regulate it in a manner so as to maintain the balance between inputs and revenues that had been established by the original version of [the Act on Promotion], a balance that was expressed by the fifteen year payback period [\u2026] and a firmly-established amount of revenues\".40\n\n*Id.,* \u00a7\u00a785-86.\n\n62.\n\nThese principles were subsequently upheld by a later decision of the Court.41\n\nExh. R-234, Decision of the Czech Constitutional Court, case no. 2216/14, 13 January 2015.\n\n**2. Decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nAlthough the Constitutional Court held that the contested measures were not unconstitutional, it recognized that they could harm individual investors in a disproportionate manner. It therefore opened the way for investors who could demonstrate that the measures had a \"strangling effect\" on their business to seek judicial redress or apply to the relevant tax authority for tax deferrals.\n\n64.\n\nConsequently, a large number of solar generators brought proceedings against the local tax administrations, arguing that the Solar Levy had a \"strangling effect\" in their particular cases.\n\n65.\n\nMost of these cases were dismissed on the basis that solar investors had no legitimate expectations beyond the 15-year payback guarantee. In its decisions, the Supreme Administrative Court confirmed that the guarantee under the Act 180 did not include a guarantee of sufficient cash flow or of a certain level of profitability:\n\n\"The fact that the investment made is not capable in certain years of its existence of generating a sufficient cash flow to cover the repayment of interest and the principal amount of the loan that is provided for a period shorter than the expected payback period does not mean that such investment cannot be expected to be paid back - there is only a problem with cash flow, resulting from various requirements pertaining to its amount in the course of the lifespan of the investment, not from the fact that the investment as a whole would not be paid back. Therefore, not only the issue of simple payback of the investment (in the sense of statutory guarantees), but also another issue of adequate profit from carrying out business on a regulated market must be perceived in relation to the overall period of the expected 20-year lifespan of photovoltaic panels. The Constitutional Court has addressed the issue of profitability in a comprehensive manner (i.e. also with respect to the method of determining the purchase prices) and has not found any defects in the amended version of [the Act on Promotion] that would automatically collide with any constitutionally guaranteed rights of photovoltaic plant operators\".42\n\nExh. R-124, Decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, case no. 2 Afs 13/2013-28, 15 August 2013, p. 8.\n\n66.\n\nThe Supreme Administrative Court further clarified that a \"strangling effect\" was one that would cause the liquidation or affect the substance of the producer:\n\n\"In certain specific, individually assessed cases, the application of [the Solar Levy] could indeed, in the opinion of the Constitutional Court, be contrary to the Constitution; however, these would only be cases where the charges would have liquidation effects and or would affect the very substance of the electricity producer in terms of its assets\".43\n\n*Id.,* p.10.\n\n67.\n\nA Grand Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court later held that the Ministry of Finance should grant tax relief to solar generators which demonstrated that, in their individual circumstances, the effect of the Solar Levy was \"suffocating\" in the sense of the 2012 Constitutional Court judgment. It also set the parameters for obtaining relief.44\n\nExh. R-225, Decision of the Grand Chamber of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, case no. 1 Afs 76/2013-57, 17 December 2013.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. WRITTEN PHASE**\n--------------------\n\n68.\n\nOn 24 June 2013, Claimants 1 and 2 served the Czech Republic with a Request for Arbitration under Article 10 of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments of 2 October 1990 (\"the Treaty\" or \"the BIT\")45 accompanied by exhibits.\n\nBy exchange of notes of 18 December 1992 and 1 January 1993 respectively, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic agreed that the Treaty would remain applicable between the two States after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.\n\n69.\n\nOn 23 August 2013 Mr. Gary Born was appointed as co-arbitrator by the Claimants. On 26 August 2013 Judge Peter Tomka was appointed as co-arbitrator by the Respondent. With the consent of the co-arbitrators and the Parties, Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler was appointed as President of the Tribunal.\n\n70.\n\nOn 3 March 2014, the Parties and Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment (\"Terms of Appointment\"). In the Terms of Appointment, the Parties agreed to the choice of Geneva as the seat of the arbitration and to the rules that would govern the arbitration. Further, they consented to the appointment of Ms. Eva Kalnina, an attorney in the firm of the President as Secretary to the Tribunal. Mr. Rahul Donde, also an attorney in the firm of the President, later replaced Ms. Kalnina with the consent of the Parties. The Parties also approved the tasks which the Secretary would perform in the course of the arbitration as described in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 19 August 2014.\n\n71.\n\nOn 12 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO 1\") in which it set the procedural calendar and other procedural rules for the arbitration. The proceedings were bifurcated, it being provided that the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections would be heard first. The bifurcation was later undone with the consent of the Parties as it arises from the following account.\n\n72.\n\nOn 18 July 2014, the Claimants filed their Statement of Claim (\"SoC\") accompanied by factual and legal exhibits, witness statements of Messrs [REDACTED], and an expert report of Mr. [REDACTED] of Alvarez and Marsal on quantum.\n\n73.\n\nOn 21 July 2014, the Tribunal received a letter dated 11 July 2014 from the European Commission (\"EC\") containing an application by the Commission to intervene as a nondisputing party in the arbitration.\n\n74.\n\nOn 23 July 2014, the Tribunal forwarded the application to the Parties, inviting them to comment. It also advised the Commission that it would hear the disputing parties on the application and revert to the Commission with its decision. An amended application filed by the Commission was subsequently conveyed to the Parties (the \"Commission\u2019s Application\").\n\n75.\n\nOn 15 August 2014, the Parties submitted their comments on the Commission\u2019s Application.\n\n76.\n\nOn 25 August 2014, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that since it intended to raise only a single jurisdictional objection regarding the lack of standing of Claimant 4, it did not wish to proceed with the bifurcation of the present arbitration. Further, it had initiated discussions with the Claimants on a new calendar for the arbitration where jurisdiction, merits and quantum issues would be heard together.\n\n77.\n\nOn 27 August 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to propose a new calendar for the arbitration, and suspended the preparation of its decision on the Commission\u2019s Application. It also separately informed the Commission that, due to likely changes in the calendar of the arbitration, its decision may be delayed.\n\n78.\n\nOn 8 September 2014, the Tribunal noted that the Parties had been unable to agree on a procedural calendar, principally because the Claimants maintained that the proceedings should remain bifurcated - a position which the Respondent opposed. On the basis of the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal decided to de-bifurcate the arbitration. The Claimants later objected to this decision.\n\n79.\n\nOn 26 September 2014, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to submit its Objections to Jurisdiction as contemplated by PO 1, and to make any additional comments on bifurcation/de-bifurcation by 27 October 2014. The Claimants were then to state whether they maintained their objections to the de-bifurcation of the arbitration and to the Commission\u2019s Application.\n\n80.\n\nOn 27 October 2014, the Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Objections to Jurisdiction\") accompanied by legal authorities.\n\n81.\n\nOn 31 October 2014, the Claimants agreed to the de-bifurcation of the arbitration. However, they maintained their opposition to the Commission\u2019s Application.\n\n82.\n\nFollowing the Claimants\u2019 approval of de-bifurcation, on 6 November 2014, the Tribunal advised the Parties that, since both Parties now consented, jurisdiction, admissibility and merits (liability and quantum) would be heard together. Accordingly, it invited the Parties to submit (preferably joint) proposals for the calendar of the arbitration, specifying that they were not to take into account the (possible) effect of the Commission\u2019s Application. If the Tribunal allowed the Commission\u2019s Application, it would insert the Commission\u2019s submission and the Parties\u2019 related comments into the calendar in parallel to other steps such that the calendar would not be affected.\n\n83.\n\nOn 13 November 2014, the Respondent contended that the Claimants had provided limited information on their purported investments \"indicat[ing] licensing irregularities that may warrant an objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the grounds of illegality of Claimants\u2019 investment\". Accordingly, it requested that document production should precede the filing of its Statement of Defense (\"SoD\") because otherwise it would be precluded from raising its illegality objection. It also submitted a proposal for the procedural calendar and commented on the Claimants\u2019 objections of 31 October 2014 to the Commission\u2019s Application.\n\n84.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimants insisted that document production should occur in the usual course after the first round of submissions. They also submitted their own proposal for the procedural calendar in the arbitration.\n\n85.\n\nTo facilitate the decision on the timing of the document production, on 24 November 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent \"to identify the documents that it seeks from the Claimants and the reasons why it does so\". At the same time, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent had agreed to the Claimants\u2019 proposal that the Tribunal rule on the Commission\u2019s Application only after the first round of submissions, i.e. after the SoD. As a result, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it would address the Commission\u2019s Application, its power to accept an *amicus* intervention, and, if applicable, the merits of such intervention and practicalities, after the submission of the SoD.\n\n86.\n\nOn 4 December 2014, the Respondent produced a table listing its document requests and explaining their relevance and materiality.\n\n87.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s submission.\n\n88.\n\nOn 16 December 2014, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request for a document production phase, and set a schedule for document production. This schedule was revised on 6 January 2015.\n\n89.\n\nOn 16 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO 2\"), in which it decided the Respondent\u2019s document production requests. It appended a revised procedural calendar.\n\n90.\n\nOn 20 March 2015, the Respondent filed its SoD accompanied by factual exhibits, legal authorities, an expert report of Ms. Kelyn Bacon, QC and an expert report by Mr. Michael Peer. The Respondent advised the Tribunal that it was seeking a decision from the Commission on whether the State aid granted for installations put into operation before 1 January 2013 was compatible with the EU internal market. It requested the Tribunal to stay the present proceedings until the Commission\u2019s decision.\n\n91.\n\nIn their reply of 13 April 2015, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s request for a stay. They argued that the Commission\u2019s decision would not affect the outcome of the case and, therefore, could not justify a stay of the proceedings. According to them, the decision was a matter outside these proceedings that would \"very likely arise only after the award was rendered\".46 Further, the decision would likely be issued only in mid to late 2016, not counting time for challenges.\n\nClaimants\u2019 communication of 13 April 2015.\n\n92.\n\nOn 24 April 2015, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s request. It noted that the request was belated and that, in any event, the Respondent had not shown how itself or the arbitration proceedings would be prejudiced if the stay was not granted. It further noted that \"[i]f the Commission\u2019s decision is rendered while the arbitration is ongoing, then the Tribunal will, of course, entertain the submissions the Parties choose to make on the effect of the decision on the arbitration. If the time comes for the Tribunal to render the award and the decision has still not been issued, the Tribunal will see at that time whether that requires it to delay the award\".\n\n93.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it was about to rule on the Commission\u2019s Application and that, before doing so, it would consider any additional comments the Parties wished to make.\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their comments on 29 April 2015, maintaining their objections of 15 August and 31 October 2014. The Respondent submitted its comments on 4 May 2015, also reiterating its earlier position.\n\n95.\n\nOn 27 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO 3\") in which it decided on the Parties\u2019 document production requests submitted to the Tribunal on 10 April 2015.\n\n96.\n\nOn 16 September 2015, the Claimants filed their Reply (the \"Reply\") accompanied by factual exhibits, legal authorities, the second witness statement of Mr. [REDACTED], as well as the second expert report of Mr. **[REDACTED].**\n\n97.\n\nOn 22 September 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"PO 4\"), in which by majority it granted the Commission\u2019s Application, and set out a timetable for the Commission\u2019s non-disputing party submission and the Parties\u2019 responses thereto. Mr. Born issued a dissenting opinion on 8 October 2015.\n\n98.\n\nOn 12 November 2015, upon a request by the Commission and after consulting the Parties, the Tribunal confirmed that the Commission\u2019s understanding of the nature of the dispute as stated in the Commission\u2019s communication of 30 October 2015 was correct. It also advised the Commission that Acts No. 165/2012, No. 310/2013 and No. 346/2010 Coll. (in respect of the latter, specifically Article I(36) and Article I(75) and transitional provisions being Articles II(2), II(9), and II(10) thereof) could be relevant to the dispute.\n\n99.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, the Commission filed its non-disputing party submission (the \"Amicus Curiae Submission\") accompanied by annexes.\n\n100.\n\nOn 17 December 2015, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder (the \"Rejoinder\" or \"Rej.\") accompanied by factual exhibits, legal authorities, a witness statement by Mr. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] the expert reports of Mr. Wynne Jones of Frontier Economics and Ms. Kelyn Bacon, QC, and the second expert report of Michael Peer of KPMG.\n\n101.\n\nOn 14 January 2016, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to disregard the witness statement of Mr. [REDACTED] and the expert report of Mr. Wynne Jones (the \"New Evidence\") on the basis that they contained evidence that should have been submitted earlier. In its response of 20 January 2016, the Respondent opposed the exclusion of the New Evidence. In its ruling of 25 January 2016, the Tribunal (i) admitted the New Evidence into the record, (ii) gave the Claimants an opportunity to file rebuttal evidence and brief explanatory comments limited to the New Evidence, and (iii) gave the Respondent an opportunity to file sur-rebuttal evidence and brief explanatory comments limited to the Claimants\u2019 just preceding submission.\n\n102.\n\nOn 15 February 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their replies to the Amicus Curiae Submission (the \"Claimants'/Respondent\u2019s Comments on the Amicus Curiae Submission\").\n\n103.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, the Claimants filed their \"Reply to the New Evidence Submitted in Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder\" (the \"Claimants\u2019 Comments on the New Evidence\"), accompanied by factual exhibits and an expert report of Mr. [REDACTED] of Onyx Energy Consulting.\n\n104.\n\nOn 29 March 2016, upon receipt of the Parties\u2019 comments, the Tribunal advised the Parties and the Commission that, as it had the benefit of the Commission\u2019s extensive submission, it did not require Commission representatives to attend the hearing.\n\n105.\n\nOn 14 April 2016, the President, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, and the Parties held a telephone conference to discuss the outstanding issues pertaining to the organization of the hearing.\n\n106.\n\nOn 18 April 2016, the Respondent filed its \"Sur-Rebuttal Comments on 'New Evidence'\", accompanied by factual exhibits, legal authorities and the second expert report of Mr. Wynne Jones.\n\n107.\n\nOn 19 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (\"PO 5\") in which it set out certain organizational issues for the hearing. Further directions were issued subsequently.\n\n**B. HEARING ON JURISDICTION AND MERITS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nFrom 9 to 12 May 2016, a hearing on jurisdiction and merits was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague. In addition to the Tribunal and the Secretary, the following persons attended the hearing in whole or in part:\n\n\u2022 For the Claimants:\n\no Counsel\n\n[REDACTED], Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft\n\n[REDACTED], Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft\n\no Party Representative\n\n[REDACTED] Wirtgen\n\no Experts:\n\n[REDACTED] Onyx Energy Consulting\n\n[REDACTED] Onyx Energy\n\n[REDACTED] Alvarez & & Marsal\n\n[REDACTED] Alvarez & & Marsal\n\no Witnesses:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\u2022 For the Respondent:\n\no Counsel\n\nPaolo Di Rosa, Arnold & Porter LLP Dmitri Evseev, Arnold & Porter (UK) LLP Mallory Silberman, Arnold & Porter LLP Peter Nikitin, Arnold & Porter (UK) LLP Bart Wasiak, Arnold & Porter (UK) LLP Aim\u00e9e Reilert, Arnold & Porter LLP Dara Wachsman, Arnold & Porter (UK) LLP\n\nKarolina Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1, Weil, Gotschal & Manges s.r.o.

(colleague of Mr. Peer)\n\no Witness\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n109.\n\nExcept for Messrs [REDACTED] and Urban, whose cross-examination was not requested, all the fact witnesses and experts listed above were heard.\n\n110.\n\nOn the penultimate day of the hearing, the Tribunal posed several questions to the Parties, which they answered in their closing oral statements on the last day of the hearing.\n\n**C. POST-HEARING PHASE**\n-------------------------\n\n111.\n\nOn 17 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (\"PO 6\"), reproducing the directions given by the Tribunal at the end of the hearing with regard to post-hearing matters. It noted the Parties\u2019 agreement that there would be no post hearing briefs.\n\n112.\n\nOn 31 May 2016, the Parties submitted their joint revisions to the hearing transcripts.\n\n113.\n\nOn 15 June 2016, the Parties submitted their cost submissions.\n\n114.\n\nOn 20 June 2016, in response to an allegation made by the Claimants in their cost submission concerning double recovery, the Respondent confirmed that \"the costs for which the Czech Republic seeks recovery in this case are ones that are solely allocated to this proceeding, and shall not be included in cost submissions in any other matter. In consequence, there is no risk of \"double recovery\".\n\n115.\n\nOn 21 October 2016, the Tribunal advised the Parties and the Commission that it had deliberated and determined that it had all necessary information to proceed to draft its award. Subject to any comments to be made by 4 November 2016, the Tribunal would thus close the proceedings.\n\n116.\n\nOn 29 October 2016, the Commission advised the Tribunal that the German *Bundesgerichtshof* had requested the European Court of Justice (\"ECJ\") to issue a preliminary ruling on whether a provision similar to Article 10 of the Treaty appearing in an intra-EU BIT was compatible with EU law. It suggested that the Tribunal stay the arbitration pending a decision by the ECJ. It also advised the Tribunal that the Commission had adopted the second step of the infringement procedure against five EU Member States for not having formally terminated their intra-EU BITs.\n\n117.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent confirmed that they did not have any comments to make before the Tribunal closed the proceedings.\n\n118.\n\nOn 7 November 2016, the Tribunal conveyed the Commission\u2019s submission of 29 October 2016 to the Parties, giving them the opportunity to comment on the submission by 14 November 2016.\n\n119.\n\nOn 7 November 2016, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to instruct the Commission to submit an English language translation of Annex 1 of the Commission\u2019s submission.\n\n120.\n\nOn 11 November 2016, the Tribunal advised the Parties that they could submit their comments referring to their own translation of Annex 1 if at all necessary.\n\n121.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, the Claimants responded to the Commission\u2019s submission, opposing the Commission\u2019s suggestion of staying the proceeding. They pointed out that the *Bundesgerichtshof* had approached the ECJ on 3 March 2016, two months before the oral hearing in the present arbitration. The Commission had thus approached the Tribunal belatedly, in an attempt to delay the award. Further, they submitted that the Commission\u2019s submission should be rejected as it was inadmissible and had no legal basis.\n\n122.\n\nIn its response of the same day, the Respondent too opposed the Commission\u2019s suggestion of staying the proceeding. It submitted that, while the Czech Republic shared many of the Commission\u2019s concerns about the possible incompatibility of intra-EU investor-state dispute settlement with EU law, the pendency of the preliminary ruling proceeding did not justify staying the present arbitration as neither disputing Party had asked the Tribunal to declare that the Treaty was incompatible with EU law. It also pointed out that a decision by the ECJ would take a long time, and that the court could limit the effect of the ruling to the period after the ruling, in which case it would not affect the present dispute.\n\n123.\n\nOn 2 December 2016, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to reopen the proceedings. They noted that on 28 November 2016, the Commission had decided that the Support Scheme did not constitute unlawful State aid (the \"Commission Decision\"). The Claimants also requested leave to introduce into the record the press release of the Commission and, once available, the Commission Decision.\n\n124.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants\u2019 request by 13 December 2016.\n\n125.\n\nIn its response of 13 December 2016, the Respondent did not object to the Claimants\u2019 request to reopen the proceedings, or their request to file the Commission Decision and accompanying press release into the record. Instead, it offered to submit an unredacted version of the Commission Decision into the record, on the condition that it be treated as confidential. It also submitted that the Parties should only be given a limited opportunity to comment on the Commission Decision.\n\n126.\n\nOn 15 December 2016, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it would accept submissions on the Commission Decision and that, subject to these submissions, the proceedings were closed. The Respondent was invited to introduce the un-redacted version of the Commission Decision and accompanying press release into the record on the understanding that the un-redacted version of the Commission Decision would be treated as confidential. Moreover, the Parties were invited to make simultaneous submissions on the Commission Decision by 6 January 2017. There would be a second round of simultaneous submissions if a Party so requested or if the Tribunal so directed.\n\n127.\n\nThe next day, the Claimants agreed to the procedure proposed by the Tribunal and requested that the Respondent produce the Commission Decision by 19 December 2016, or else they would need more time to prepare their submission.\n\n128.\n\nOn 19 December 2016, the Respondent confirmed that it would submit the Commission Decision on 19th or 20th December 2016, and subsequently did so on 20 December.\n\n129.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Tribunal advised the Parties that as the Commission Decision was filed a day later than requested by the Claimants, and having due regard to the intervening holidays, the time limit for submission of the Parties\u2019 comments on the Commission Decision was extended to 10 January 2017 and the subsequent time limit for advising the Tribunal if either Party wished a second round was deferred to 17 January 2017.\n\n130.\n\nOn 10 January 2017, the Parties submitted their comments on the Commission Decision (the \"Claimants'/Respondent\u2019s Comments on the Commission Decision\").\n\n131.\n\nOn 17 January 2017, the Parties advised the Tribunal that they did not seek a second round of submissions. The next day, the Tribunal confirmed that it too did not require further submissions.\n\n132.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, the Commission wrote to the Tribunal attaching its submission on its Decision (the \"Commission\u2019s Submission\").\n\n133.\n\nOn 1 March 2017, the Tribunal conveyed the Commission\u2019s Submission to the Parties. It advised them that while the Tribunal did not expect any further submissions from the Parties, if either Party considered that the Commission\u2019s Submission called for further comments, it could file such comments by 10 March 2017.\n\n134.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, the Claimants commented on the Commission\u2019s Submission, stating that it did not agree with the Commission\u2019s views. On its part, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that it did not intend to provide comments.\n\n135.\n\nOn 23 March 2017, the Claimants asked the Secretary for a status update on the issuance of the award. The Secretary replied on 27 March 2017 stating that the Tribunal would advise the Parties of the status of the award shortly.\n\n136.\n\nOn 27 March 2017, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it anticipated being in a position to issue its decision in principle in late June or early July.\n\n137.\n\nOn 7 July 2017, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it was well advanced in its deliberations and that it anticipated issuing its award no later than September. It stated that the Parties would be given three days advance notice before sending out the award.\n\n138.\n\nOn 25 August 2017, the Tribunal advised the Parties that the award was ready to be issued. However, one member of the Tribunal was preparing an opinion that would not be ready before late September. The Parties could therefore choose to jointly receive the award first and the opinion later, or to receive the award and the opinion together at a later time.\n\n139.\n\nOn 28 August 2017, the Claimants advised the Tribunal that they would prefer receiving the award and opinion together. The Respondent wrote on 1 September 2017 that \"the Czech Republic would prefer that the Award be issued as soon as possible, and [...] any separate opinion be distributed at a later time.\"\n\n140.\n\nOn 11 September 2017,the Tribunal advised the Parties that it would follow the usual practice in international arbitration and issue award and opinion together.\n\n141.\n\nOn 6 October 2017, the Parties were notified that the award would be issued on 11 October 2017.\n\n**IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimants have summarized their case as follows:\n\n\"Claimants invested in 2009 and 2010 in three PV-plants in the Czech Republic. Their investment decision was based on explicit guarantees contained in the Support Scheme, among others, that the feed-in tariff given at the time of commissioning the plants would be guaranteed for twenty years. The Support Scheme also preserved long-term income tax exemptions and shortened depreciation periods. The Czech Republic endorsed these benefits at home and abroad in order to attract foreign investors.\n\nBased on these guarantees, Claimants, having procured due diligence reports to assess the factual and legal risks involved, proceeded with their investment. At the time of their investments, the introduction of the solar levy was in no way foreseeable. Claimants relied on the explicit guarantees that the Czech Republic itself deemed to be in full compliance with EU law.\n\nRespondent has tried to argue that the guarantee for a return on investment within fifteen years [was the] \"operative basis\" of the Support Scheme. Claimants have shown that this term coined by Respondent for the purpose of these proceedings finds no basis whatsoever in the wording of the Support Scheme, the legislative history, the representations of the Czech Republic or the decisions of domestic courts. Respondent also failed to show that Claimants or any other investors received \"windfall profits\" as a result of an alleged drop in prices for solar panels between 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, Respondent has not submitted any evidence suggesting that the solar levy was introduced to curb \"windfall profits\". Instead, the legislative documents show that the solar levy was simply introduced to reduce the effect of the solar subsidies on the national budget and on the consumer prices.\n\nFinally, Respondent has failed to explain what any other due diligence, besides the extensive due diligence reports obtained from three law firms by Claimants, should have brought to light and why this should have discouraged Claimants to invest in the Czech Republic. All of Claimants three PV-plants are currently operating and there are no pending disputes with Czech authorities regarding the permits or licenses of those plants.\n\nThis is not a dispute about naive or negligent investors rushing-in to benefit from \"windfall profits\". It is a dispute about experienced businessmen investing in the Czech Republic on the basis of highly specific legislative guarantees which they were invited to rely on by the Czech Republic. In essence, the question that has to be decided is whether states should be allowed to open the honeypot to attract foreign investors and then, once those investors commit serious capital to the host country, to retract and circumvent long-term guarantees and simply fail to hold-up their end of the bargain\".47\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7125-129.\n\n143.\n\nIn so far as they are relevant to resolve the issues in dispute, the Claimants\u2019 detailed arguments will be summarized in the introduction to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of each disputed issue. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal emphasizes that, while it has only referred to the aspects of the Claimants\u2019 case which are most pertinent to its decision, it has considered all of the Claimants\u2019 submissions and evidence.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANTS' REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nIn their SoC, the Claimants sought the following relief:\n\n\"I.

C-115, Claimants\u2019 Closing Presentation, 12 May 2016.\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondent opposed the revision of the Claimants\u2019 requests for relief as untimely.\n\n**C. SUMMARY OF THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent has summarized its case as follows:\n\n\"Like thousands of other investors, Claimants raced to take advantage of the massive decline in solar panel costs [...], before the price drop could be reflected in the regulated subsidy price. In doing so, Claimants hoped to earn substantially more than the rate of return targeted by the regulation. However [\u2026] Claimants never received any assurances of stabilization of the regime, or assurances that the State would refrain from measures that could reduce their excess profits. Unlike a traditional business, Claimants\u2019 investments were (and remain) almost wholly shielded from market risk for a period of 20 years. This does not mean, however, that they were also shielded from the risk of legislative change. To the contrary, in a subsidy-based regulated environment and in the absence of market forces, it is the State and its energy regulator that must protect the public interest by ensuring that industry subsidies do not result in windfall profits at the expense of electricity consumers and taxpayers.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nClaimants\u2019 [arguments] are largely divorced from reality. Some of these arguments rely on the denial of basic facts, including the dramatic decline in solar panel prices by mid-2009 and the resulting imbalance between the fixed subsidies and the profit levels targeted by the regulation. Other arguments attempt to shift focus away from the key benchmarks of investment return (within 15 years) and reasonable profit (over the 20-year lifetime of the solar plants), by emphasizing other provisions, such as those providing for fixed tariff rates, which in fact were not modified at all by the Tax Measures. By the same token, Claimants\u2019 repeated references to \"contracts and licenses\" embodying their supposed guarantees lose sight of the fact that none of these documents contained any guarantees whatsoever with respect to taxation, profitability, or even the RES Scheme more broadly.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply also fails to acknowledge the clear relevance of EU law to the core issues in this case. [T]he EU Treaties remain part of the applicable law in this arbitration, regardless of the fact that the seat of this arbitration is outside the EU [\u2026] EU law is important both to the merits of the dispute and to the issue of enforceability of the award\n\n[\u2026]\n\nClaimants fail to establish that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain claims for alleged injury to Claimant JSW Solar KG, because that entity does not qualify as an \"investor\" within the meaning of the BIT. The fact that JSW Solar KG does not qualify as an investor under the BIT means that all claims for alleged injury to that entity must be excluded from this arbitration.\n\nIn any event, all of the Claimants have utterly failed to substantiate their merits claims. As discussed below, Claimants assert claims under three different provisions of the BIT \u2014 the umbrella clause, the fair and equitable treatment clause, and the full protection and security clause \u2014 which ultimately boil down to two unfounded theories of liability: first, that the Government supposedly altered domestic law in circumstances when it was internationally-bound not to do so; and, second, that the measures are flawed because they allegedly were intended to deliberately harm Claimants. Each of these theories founders on both law and fact\".52\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a75 et. seq.\n\n149.\n\nIn so far as they are relevant to resolve the issues in dispute, the Czech Republic\u2019s detailed arguments will be summarized below just before the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of each disputed issue. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that, while it has only referred to the elements of the Respondent\u2019s case which are most important for its decision, it has considered all of the Respondent\u2019s submissions and evidence.\n\n**D. THE RESPONDENT'S REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIn the SoD, the Respondent sought the following relief:\n\n\"For the foregoing reasons, and reserving the right to further develop and expand its submission and request for relief, the Czech Republic respectfully requests the Tribunal to:\n\na) order a stay of the present proceedings until the European Commission issues a decision in the proceedings regarding state aid represented by the RES Scheme as applicable to installations commissioned before 1 January 2013 (the other requested relief thus being in the alternative);\n\nb) declare that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Claimant JSW Solar (zwei) GmbH & Co. KG;\n\nc) declare that the Czech Republic has not breached the Treaty;\n\nd) dismiss all of the Claimants\u2019 claims in their entirety;\n\ne) order the Claimants to pay the costs of these arbitral proceedings, including the cost of the Tribunal and the legal and other costs incurred by the Czech Republic, on a full indemnity basis; and\n\nf) order the Claimants to pay interest on any costs awarded to the Czech Republic, in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal\".53\n\nSoD, \u00a7317.\n\n151.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent sought the following relief:\n\n\"For the reasons set forth above, the Czech Republic respectfully reiterates its request that the Tribunal (a) reject Claimants\u2019 claims in their entirety because (with regard to JSW Solar KG) they are outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and, in any case, are entirely lacking in merit; and (b) issue an award of costs and fees (including all legal fees and expenses), and interest thereon, in favor of the Czech Republic\".54\n\nRej., \u00a7487.\n\n152.\n\nThese requests were not changed at the hearing.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n**A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n153.\n\nPrior to entering the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal will address the applicable procedural law (1), the law governing jurisdiction (2) and the merits of the dispute (3) as well the maxim *jura novit curia* (4) and the relevance of previous decisions or awards (5).\n\n**1. Applicable Procedural Law**\n--------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThis *ad hoc* investment arbitration is governed by (i) the procedural rules contained in the BIT and, as it is seated in Geneva and involves non-Swiss parties, by (ii) Chapter 12 of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law Act (PILA).55 As for the Treaty, Article 10(2) contains some basic provisions on the constitution of an arbitral tribunal for settlement of an investment dispute. It further provides that \"[i]nsofar as the parties do not agree otherwise, the provisions of Article 9, paragraphs 3 to 556 shall be appropriately applied\" in an investment arbitral proceeding. In accordance with Article 9(5), the arbitral tribunal shall reach its decisions by a majority of votes and the decisions of the Tribunal shall be binding. This Article also gives some guidance on costs and provides that the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure in respect of other matters.57\n\nArt. 176(1) PILA.\n\nArticle 9 applies to the settlement of disputes between the Contracting States of the Treaty.\n\nArticle 9(5) of the Treaty: \"Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in arbitration proceedings; the cost of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may decide on a different allocation of costs. The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure as regards other matters.\"\n\n155.\n\nIn implementation of Article 9(5) of the Treaty and taking account of the seat of the arbitration, Section 8 of the Terms of Appointment provides as follows:\n\n\"APPLICABLE PROCEDURAL RULES\n\nThis arbitration shall be governed by (in the following order of precedence):\n\na) The mandatory rules of the law on international arbitration applicable at the seat of the arbitration;\n\nb) These Terms of Appointment and the procedural rules issued by the Arbitral Tribunal, as will be reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 and any amendments thereof.\n\n44. If the provisions therein do not address a specific procedural issue, the applicable procedural issue shall be determined by agreement between the Parties or, in the absence of such agreement, by the Arbitral Tribunal\".\n\n**2. Law Governing Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nIt is generally accepted that an investment tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by international law, first and foremost by the BIT. In addition, the Tribunal may look to other rules of international law which may apply as between the Contracting Parties. National law may be relevant to jurisdictional requirements depending on the issue in question, particularly if the Treaty contains a reference to national law58 or uses a term that can only be understood by reference to national law.59\n\nSee for e.g. *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2012 (\"*Quiborax*\"), \u00a747.\n\nThis determination is in line with Article 178 PILA. As to its form, there is no question that the arbitration agreement is in writing under Article 178(1). As to the law governing substantive validity, the determination accords with the first two options of Article 178(2) PILA, being specified that the Contracting States consent to jurisdiction and applicable law when concluding the treaty and the investor when starting an arbitration under it.\n\n**3. Law Governing the Merits**\n-------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nWhile they agree on the application of the BIT to the merits of the dispute, the Parties and the EC diverge on the applicability of EU law. In light of this divergence, it falls on the Tribunal to determine whether EU law may find application. It will do so (d) after having summarized the Parties\u2019 ((a) and (b)) and the Commission\u2019s positions (c).60\n\nThe Commission\u2019s argument that the applicability of EU law deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction is considered below.\n\n**a. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Parties agreed that the law relevant to the present dispute is the Treaty and public international law. Had the Parties intended for any law to apply additionally, they would have said so. The Claimants further submit that although the Treaty does not define the applicable law, its existence is governed by public international law. Thus, where the Treaty provides no guidance, deficiencies in the Treaty can be remedied by turning to principles of public international law.\n\n159.\n\nAs to the application of EU law, it is the Claimants\u2019 position that EU law is irrelevant to the resolution of the dispute. The application of EU law would \"exceeds the commitments as agreed by the parties to the BIT, as well as the parties to this dispute\",61 which is underscored by the agreement of the Parties to arbitrate outside of the EU.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Comments on the Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a712.\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimants are further of the view that, while EU law may be applied as international or supranational law within the EU, this does not mean that EU law is international law within the international legal order. The Tribunal cannot place EU law at the same level as the rules set in the Treaty. In the event that the Tribunal considers it necessary to take EU law into account, the Claimants argue that it should apply as national law. Other international tribunals have treated national law as fact and there is no reason to deviate from that approach here.\n\n161.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants submit that the closest connection test provided in Article 187 of the PILA is irrelevant for present purposes. Domestic conflict law rules, they contend, play no role in an investor-State arbitration under a BIT. They further underline that the Treaty provides for both state-to-state arbitration in Article 9 and for investor-State arbitration in Article 10, and that the latter refers to the former in respect of procedural matters. They contend that \"[i]t is evidently absurd to assume that proceedings under Article 9 should be subject to national law. It is equally absurd to assume that proceedings under Article 10, which refer to the same subject matter, should be subject to national law\".62\n\nClaimants\u2019 Comments on the Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a724.\n\n162.\n\nIn any event, they submit that the closest connection test is only relevant where the parties have not chosen the applicable law. Here, as the Parties have chosen the Treaty and public international law, the closest connection test does not come into play.\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent submits that for issues that are not expressly regulated in the Treaty, the Tribunal must look to the Treaty\u2019s governing law. Since the Treaty offers no guidance, the Tribunal must determine \"the rules of law with which the case has the closest connection\" in accordance with Article 187 of the PILA.\n\n164.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s submission, the \"rules of law\" with the closest connection in this case are the rules and principles of international law. This is because the Treaty is an international instrument and because the Claimants allege that the Czech Republic has breached international law. Further, as the Claimants invested in the Czech Republic and because they are German nationals, Czech law and, to some extent, German law are also relevant. Swiss law too is relevant as it provides the procedural rules that the Tribunal must follow in the absence of an agreement between the Parties. In sum, the Tribunal must first have regard to the rules and principles of international law, supplemented if necessary by the rules of Czech and German law as applicable.\n\n165.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that because of the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the EU, \"[t]he EU Treaties, and the general principles, rules and regulations comprised therein [\u2026] constitute applicable rules and principles of international law in force between the Contracting Parties to the BIT\".63 Consequently, EU law too forms part of the \"rules of law\" applicable in this dispute.\n\nRej., \u00a7306.\n\n166.\n\nFor the Respondent, EU law itself is highly relevant in multiple ways. First, EU law forms part of the international law applicable to this dispute and is a source of international obligations. Second, to the extent the Tribunal finds that the municipal law of the Czech Republic or Germany are applicable to any issue in dispute, EU law is relevant as it forms an integral part of these legal systems. Third, EU law must also be taken into account when interpreting the obligations contained in the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"). Fourth, as part of the legal order binding on the Czech Republic, EU law is relevant as a fact when assessing the rationality of the Czech Republic\u2019s conduct, as well as the legitimacy of the Claimants\u2019 expectations. Fifth, EU law is relevant to the enforceability of the award.\n\n167.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that, as a matter of international law, the Treaty must be interpreted harmoniously with EU law to the extent possible. If harmonious interpretation is not possible, the Treaty must be \"disapplied\". This is so because of the fundamental principle of \"primacy\" of the EU legal order over all conflicting norms including treaties concluded between EU Member States. If this were not so, EU Treaties would be unable to function as its Member States could enter into new international agreements amongst themselves that would derogate from EU law. The Treaty does not allow its Contracting Parties to escape obligations imposed by EU law.\n\n**c. The Commission\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Commission observes that, like other German BITs, the Treaty contains no choice of law. Thus, the governing law must be determined in conformity with the rules under which the arbitration is conducted. Arbitral tribunals have generally considered that BITs are governed by international law. Further, EU law is also applied as part of international law binding on Germany and the Czech Republic. The outcome would be the same under the \"closest connection\" test: EU law would apply because the Czech Republic transposed EU directives into the Czech legal order as part of its obligations under EU law.\n\n169.\n\nFinally, the Commission shares the view of the Respondent that Member States cannot invoke international agreements which they have concluded between themselves to justify a failure to comply with EU law.\n\n**d. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n170.\n\nSection 7 of the Terms of Appointment records that the Parties consent to the application of the BIT.64 Indeed, this arbitration has been initiated under Article 10 of the Treaty. The Claimants\u2019 seek damages for the Czech Republic\u2019s alleged breaches of the Treaty. In the circumstances, the Treaty is the primary source of applicable law.\n\nSee also Claimants\u2019 Reply to Commission\u2019s Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a710 (\"[T]he dispute should be governed by the provisions of the BIT.\") and Rej., \u00a7299 (\"[I]n resolving this dispute, the Tribunal must, first and foremost look to the provisions of the BIT itself.\").\n\n171.\n\nBeyond the application of the BIT, Section 7 of the Terms of Appointment notes that the Tribunal will determine the governing law:\n\n\"APPLICABLE SUBSTANTIVE LAW\n\nThe applicable law, in addition to the application of the BIT which is uncontroversial, will be subject to briefing by the Parties and determined by the Tribunal\".\n\n172.\n\nFrom the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal understands that there is no dispute - and rightly so - on the applicability of international law in addition to the Treaty.65\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 Comments on the Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a711; SoC \u00a7168; Rej. \u00a7\u00a7299 et. seq.\n\n173.\n\nBy contrast, there is no common ground on the status and applicability of EU law. The Claimants argue that EU law cannot be categorized as international law. Only if relevant or necessary, may EU law be applied as domestic law. The Respondent takes a contrary position, arguing that EU law forms part of the applicable international law.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus focus its choice of law analysis on determining the role of EU law if any. Doing so, it bears in mind Article 187 of the PILA, which provides that, failing a choice of law, the tribunal must apply the rules of law with the closest connection with the dispute in accordance with the so-called principle of proximity. Here, the BIT contains no choice of law and the disputing Parties have not agreed on the application of EU law. Hence, the Tribunal will assess the applicable law under the principle of proximity, being specified that it enjoys substantial discretion in doing so.66\n\nGabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler/Antonio Rigozzi, International Arbitration - Law and Practice in Switzerland, OUP 2015, \u00a77.47.\n\n175.\n\nThe status and applicability of EU law in investment treaty arbitration were exhaustively discussed in *Electrabel v. Hungary.67* Essentially, *Electrabel* considered that EU law was \"a *sui generis* legal order, presenting different facets depending on the perspective from where it is analysed\". Accordingly, it found that EU law was on the one hand an \"international legal regime\" and, on the other, \"once introduced in the national legal orders of EU Member States\",68 it became \"part of these national legal orders\".69 This being so, EU law should not be confined to the national legal order: \"[i]n the international setting in which this Tribunal is situated and from which it necessarily derives its perspective\",70 so continued the ICSID tribunal, \"EU law has to be classified first as international law\",71 \"because it is rooted in international treaties\".72 It added that \"EU law as a whole is part of the international legal order\"73 and that \"EU legal rules are part of a regional system of international law and therefore have an international legal character\".74 In other words, the fact that EU law is also applied within the national legal order of an EU Member State does not deprive it of its international legal nature, whereby it is irrelevant from the perspective of international law \"whether such application within a national legal order take effect directly or indirectly\".75 As a result, the *Electrabel* tribunal concluded that there was no \"fundamental difference in nature between international law and EU law that could justify treating EU law, unlike other international rules, differently in an international arbitration requiring the application of relevant rules and principles of international law\".76 Finally, *Electrabel* noted that, \"when it is not applied as international rules [...], EU law must in any event be considered as part of the Respondent\u2019s national legal order, i.e. to be treated as a \"fact\" before this international tribunal\".77\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012 (\"*Electrabel*\"), \u00a7\u00a74,117ff.\n\n*Id.,* \u00a74,118.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* \u00a74,119.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* \u00a74,120.\n\n*Id.,* \u00a74,122.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* \u00a74,125.\n\n*Id.,* \u00a74,126.\n\n*Id.,* \u00a74,127.\n\n176.\n\nTribunals in *Achmea v. Slovak Republic78* and *Euram v. Slovak Republic79* have reached similar conclusions.\n\n*Achmea B.V. (formerly Eureko B.V.) v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2008-13, Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010 (\"*Achmea*\").\n\n*European American Investment Bank v. Slovakia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 October 2012 (\"*Euram*\").\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the reasoning and conclusions of the *Electrabel* tribunal persuasive, and sees no reason to depart from them in the present proceedings. It concludes that international law, which applies in addition to the Treaty, encompasses EU law. Further, on some occasions, the Tribunal may take EU law - which otherwise forms part of a national legal system of an EU Member State - into account as a relevant fact.80\n\nThe Parties\u2019 agree. See Respondent\u2019s Comments on the Amicus Curiae submission, \u00a74 (\"this Tribunal [should] take account of EU law as both a relevant fact and applicable law to the merits of the dispute.\"); Claimants\u2019 Comments on the Commission Decision, \u00a71 (\"Claimants maintain their position that EU law, including EU state aid law, must be treated as domestic law and thus as part of the factual matrix.\").\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these conclusions are sufficient for the present purposes and that it can dispense with addressing the arguments concerning the so-called \"primacy\" of EU law over the Treaty. Indeed, for the reasons mentioned below [\u00a7\u00a7250 et. seq.], the Tribunal has found no relevant conflict between EU law and the Treaty. Therefore, the question of primacy, if any, simply does not arise.\n\n**4. Jura Novit Curia**\n-----------------------\n\n179.\n\nWhen applying the governing law as it was just identified, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments or sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim *jura novit curia* -or, better, *jura novit arbiter* - the Tribunal is required to apply the law of its own motion, provided always that it seeks the Parties\u2019 views if it intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate. This is a principle followed by international courts and tribunals81 and is also the rule under Swiss international arbitration law.82\n\nE.g. among others *Quiborax*, \u00a747.\n\n*Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, \u00a7295 (\"[\u2026] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, sua sponte, rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\"). See also *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case* (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, 25 July 1974, \u00a718 (\"[i]t being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court.\"); *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL Case (\"*Oostergetel*\"), Award, 23 April 2012, \u00a7141; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013 (\"*Metal-Tech*\"), \u00a7287.\n\n**5. Relevance of Previous Decisions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nIn support of their positions, both sides have relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a solution reached by another tribunal.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of other arbitral tribunals. At the same time, however, the Tribunal considers that it should pay due respect to such decisions. Unless there are reasons to the contrary, the Tribunal will adopt the approach established in a series of consistent cases, subject, of course, to the specifics of the Treaty and to the circumstances of the actual case. By doing so, the Tribunal is of the view that it will act in conformity with its duty to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.\n\n**B. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n182.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Treaty is in force. Through the Exchange of Notes on 18 December 1992 and 1 January 1993, the Governments of the Czech Republic and of the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed that the treaties concluded between the latter and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic would remain in force with respect to the Czech Republic as long as both parties would not agree otherwise. No such contrary agreement has been concluded.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants initiated the present arbitration under Article 10 of the Treaty which provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"(1) Disputes concerning investments between a Contracting State and an investor from the respective other Contracting State should as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(2) If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the date on which it was raised by one of the parties to the dispute, it shall, at the request of the investor from the other Contracting State, be submitted to arbitration.\n\n[\u2026]\"\n\n184.\n\nIt is undisputed83 that the following requirements set in Article 10 have been complied with:\n\n\u2022 The Parties \"numerous\" attempts to settle the dispute amicably have failed.84 Hence, the requirement of Article 10(1) of the Treaty is met.\n\n\u2022 Each of the Claimants has accepted the Respondent\u2019s offer to arbitrate contained in Article 10(2) of the Treaty:\n\no Claimants 1, 2 and 4, i.e. J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen, Stefan Wirtgen and JSW Solar (zwei) GmbH & Co. KG, have accepted the offer by filing the Request for Arbitration on 24 June 2013;\n\no Claimant 3, i.e. Ms. Gisela Wirtgen, has accepted the offer to arbitrate by her letter of 6 January 2014.\n\n\u2022 The present dispute concerns \"investments\". Article 1(1) of the Treaty contains a broad definition of \"investment\", which includes \"ownership of movable and immovable property\" and \"shares of companies and other kinds of interest in companies\". Moreover, there is common ground that the Claimants made an allocation of resources for a long duration at their risk when they invested through JSW Solar v.o.s., JSW Solar (zwei) k.s. and FVE Verne s.r.o. in the construction and operation of three PV plants in the Czech Republic.\n\n\u2022 The Respondent does not dispute that Claimants 1, 2 and 3 qualify as \"investors\" as defined in Article 1(3) of the BIT.\n\nIn its initial submissions, the Respondent mentioned that it would challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on three separate grounds: (i) that the Claimants had violated the six-month waiting period under Article 10(2) of the Treaty with respect to the application of the 10% Solar Levy to the Claimants\u2019 solar plants commissioned in 2010 through Act 310/2013; (ii) that the Claimants had violated the six-month waiting period also with respect to the claims of Ms. Gisela Wirtgen, Claimant 3, and (iii) that JSW lacked standing in this arbitration. However, it later explained that the first two objections relating to the Claimants\u2019 violation of the six month waiting period had become moot through the passage of time (see, for instance, Respondent\u2019s letter of 25 August 2014). Hence, the Respondent decided to proceed only with the third jurisdictional objection concerning Claimant 4, which is considered below. Further, in its Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent noted that the \"little information\" provided by the Claimants in respect of their investments led the Respondent to believe that there may be \"licensing irregularities\". Accordingly, the Respondent reserved the right to raise a jurisdictional objection on the grounds of illegality of the Claimants\u2019 investment. However, no such objection was made.\n\nSoC, \u00a7\u00a7160-164.\n\n185.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent contends that Claimant 4, i.e. JSW, is not an investor within the meaning of Article 1(3) of the BIT (1). Further, in its Amicus Curiae Submission, the Commission argues that EU law deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction (2). Both these arguments are considered below.\n\n**1. Is Claimant 4 an Investor?**\n---------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants bear the burden of establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the Treaty and that they have failed to meet this burden with respect to JSW.\n\n187.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the wording of Article 1(3) of the Treaty is clear. The Claimants must meet three cumulative requirements for JSW to be considered as an \"investor\" within the meaning of Article 1(3): (i) JSW is a \"juridical person\", (ii) JSW has its seat in \"the territory covered by\" the Treaty, and (iii) JSW is \"authorized to act as an investor\". For the Czech Republic, JSW fails to meet the first requirement. It is not a \"juridical person\", because it is a \"limited partnership\" (Kommanditgesellschaft or \"KG\"), which lacks legal personality under German law.85\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, \u00a742.\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimants\u2019 translation of Article 1(3) of the Treaty and submits that the term \"juristische person\" in the German version and \"pr\u00e1vnick\u00e1 osoba\" in the Czech version \"unequivocally translate as juridical person\",86 and not as \"legal entity\". Thus, despite the Claimants\u2019 submissions to the contrary, the Treaty only covers investors who are \"juridical persons\", a requirement that JSW does not satisfy.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, \u00a734.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent denies the Claimants\u2019 submissions that the term \"juridical person\" must be interpreted autonomously. For the Respondent, the Claimants have advanced no \"principled reason\" why the Tribunal should ignore German law for purposes of determining whether JSW can be deemed a German \"investor\" under the Treaty. Indeed, a treaty is not a self-contained legal system and reference may be made to a \"wider juridical context\".87 The absence of express *renvoi* to domestic law is not determinative, as tribunals have frequently relied on definitions of domestic law to give content to treaty terms, even absent an express reference.\n\nRej., \u00a7380.\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent also refutes the Claimants\u2019 submission that an entity only needs legal capacity, but not legal personality to fall within the ambit of Article 1(3) of the Treaty. This view is not in line with the text of the Treaty. Neither is it supported by German treaty practice or international law. It is irrelevant in the Respondent\u2019s submission that resort to domestic law may yield different results for Czech and German entities. Indeed, a BIT is not meant to standardize nationality requirements or corporate formalities of the two Contracting Parties.\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants\u2019 argument that this approach would not respect the object and purpose of the Treaty. According to it, \"if a person or entity does not qualify as an \"investor of the other Contracting Party\", by definition the exclusion of that person or entity from the BIT\u2019s protection cannot contradict the object and purpose of the BIT. In fact, the precise opposite is true: it would contradict such object and purpose to include such a person within the BIT\u2019s scope of coverage\".88\n\nRej., \u00a7383.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent also refutes the Claimants\u2019 argument that the exclusion of KGs from treaty protection would entail that a majority of German entities would be deprived of investment protection. It submits that, when entering into the Treaty, Germany may\n\n193.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent observes that other German BITs contain broader notions of the term \"investor\", expressly including entities other than juridical persons. Therefore, if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimants\u2019 arguments, \"the express extension to German law partnerships in other investment treaties concluded by Germany would be rendered meaningless\".89\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, \u00a753.\n\n194.\n\nShould the Tribunal deny jurisdiction over Claimant 4, the Respondent argues that all claims for alleged injury suffered by that entity must be discarded from the scope of this arbitration. Claimants 1-3 cannot be substituted for Claimant 4 as the Claimants suggest. According to the Respondent, this is so for several reasons, including \"(1) JSW Solar KG cannot assert such claims itself, (2) the remaining Claimants have not asserted claims for injury to JSW Solar KG, and (3) the remaining Claimants could not assert claims for injury to JSW Solar KG without effectively undoing any decision to decline jurisdiction over JSW Solar KG\".90 Further, the Claimants have not asserted or established any damages for their indirectly held investments.\n\nRej., \u00a78.\n\n**b. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants challenge the Respondent\u2019s position. According to them, Article 1(3) of the Treaty \"leads to the conclusion that an '[i]nvestor' only needs legal capacity, but not legal personality: it needs to be able to invest, i.e. to buy and sell, conclude contracts, sue and be sued\".91 As it is undisputed that a KG has these attributes, JSW is an \"investor\" within the scope of Article 1(3).\n\nReply, \u00a7139.\n\n196.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants submit that the term \"juridical person\" has to be interpreted autonomously; a position which they say is supported by decisions of other investment tribunals. They also note that KGs acted as claimants in three ICSID proceedings in the past without their standing being questioned. In addition, two proceedings brought by KGs are currently pending. According to the Claimants, \"if KGs can pass the hurdle under ICSID, then [...] they should also be considered juridical persons under the BIT\".92\n\nTr. (Day 4) 602:12-15.\n\n197.\n\nFor the Claimants, the very premise of the Respondent\u2019s argument is incorrect. The Respondent assumes that the Contracting Parties intended to refer to different definitions of \"juridical person\" under their national laws. That is not the case. First, a review of German BITs shows that, when Germany wished to refer to national law, it did so explicitly. Second, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation would lead to \"nonsensical\" results. A KG would be an investor in Germany, but not in the Czech Republic, which would be contrary to the reciprocal protection expressly stated in the preamble of the BIT. Finally, the Claimants stress that \"it [\u2026] is possible that a company from another EU member state which transferred its seat to Germany is an investor within the terms of the Treaty. Applying German law standards to these companies clearly is impossible\".93\n\nReply, \u00a7136.\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants insist that about one third of all German companies are KGs; they are the \"heart\" of the German economy. The Respondent \"[hasn't] put forward a single quotation, a single document from the [Treaty] negotiations which could explain why Germany suddenly should have wanted to waive protection for one third of its companies\".94\n\nTr. 45:24-46:1.\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute that German treaty practice supports the Respondent\u2019s case. While some German BITs explicitly refer to \"companies or associations with or without legal personality\", these treaties define the term \"investor\" differently for each contracting state. This is not true of the German-Czech BIT, which contains one definition for both Contracting Parties. Of the seven German BITs (including the Treaty) that contain a single definition, in four treaties the definition explicitly includes legal entities without legal personality. However, all four were concluded after the German-Czech BIT. The two other BITs, concluded in 1989, do not address the question of legal personality.95 Thus, in all but three BITs, Germany protects companies with or without legal personality. For the Claimants, there is no reason why Germany should have excluded companies without legal personality from the scope of investor protections in the German-Czech BIT.\n\nReply, \u00a7146 relying on Exh. C-094 (Definition of \"investor\" under German BITs).\n\n200.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that, the exclusion of Claimant 4 would in any event have no \"major relevance\" for the resolution of their dispute. Claimants 1-3, all of whom are natural persons, invested their own money into the solar plants through Claimant 4. In the circumstances, as the Treaty does not exclude investments held indirectly, the claims of Claimant 4 could be brought by Claimants 1-3.96\n\nTr. (Day 4) 604-605.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n201.\n\nArticle 10 of the BIT refers to disputes between a Contracting State and an \"investor\". The term \"investor\" is defined in Article 1(3), being specified that the German and Czech texts are equally authentic.97 In the German text, Article 1(3) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"[F\u00fcr die Zwecke dieses Vertrag] bezeichnet der Begriff \"Investor\" eine nat\u00fcrliche Person mit standigem Wohnsitz oder eine juristische Person mit Sitz im jeweiligen Geltungsbereich dieses Vertrags, die berechtigt ist, Kapitalanlagen zu tatigen\".98\n\nRLA-001 (\"Done at Prague on 2 October 1990, in duplicate in the German and Czech languages, both texts being equally authentic.\").\n\nExh. RLA-002.\n\n202.\n\nIn the Czech text, Article 1(3) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"[Pro \u00facely t\u00e9to Dohody] Pojem \"investor\" znamen\u00e1 fyzick\u00e9 osoby se st\u00e1lym bydlist\u00e9m nebo pr\u00e1vnick\u00e9 osoby se s\u00eddlem v okruhu p\u00fcsobnosti t\u00e9to Dohody, jez jsou opr\u00e1vn\u00e9ny jednat jako investori\".99\n\n*Id.*\n\n203.\n\nSeveral English translations are in the record:\n\n\u2022 In the Request for Arbitration, the Claimants translated Article 1(3) as:\n\n\"[For the purposes of this Agreement] an \"Investor\" is either a natural person who has its permanent residence in a contracting state *or a juridical person* with its seat in one of the Contracting States\".100\n\n\u2022 In the SoC, the Claimant then translated Article 1(3) somewhat differently:\n\n\"investor\" means a \"natural person with permanent residence *or a legal entity* with registered office in the respective area of jurisdiction of this Treaty who or which is entitled to make investments.101\n\n\u2022 In the SoD, the Respondent provided its translation:\n\n\"\"investor\" shall mean a natural person with permanent residence *or a juridical person* with its seat in the territory covered by the application of this Treaty and authorized to act as an investor\".102\n\n\u2022 In the Reply, the Claimant appeared to agree103 with the Respondent\u2019s translation just quoted:\n\n\"the term \"investor\" means a natural person with permanent residence or *a legal entity [read \"juridical person\"]* with registered office in the respective area of jurisdiction of this Treaty who or which is entitled to make investments (emphasis supplied)\".104\n\nRfA, \u00a715.\n\nSoC, \u00a7152; Exh. C-078.\n\nExh. RLA-001, Article 1(3).\n\nReply, \u00a7140 and fn.75 (\"Claimants reject the contention that they might have tampered with the wording of the translation. They did not do the translation themselves. [\u2026] Claimants will adopt \u2014 for the sake of argument \u2014 Respondent\u2019s terminology.\").\n\nReply, \u00a7140.\n\n204.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal understands that the Parties are in principle in agreement that the term \"investor\" in the Treaty is defined as:\n\n\"a natural person with permanent residence or a *juridical person* with its seat in the territory covered by the application of this Treaty and authorized/entitled to act as an investor\".\n\n205.\n\nFrom its own reading of the original versions of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers this translation accurate being specified that the word \"berechtigt\" in German or \"opr\u00e1vn\u00e9ny\" in Czech is more precisely reflected by \"entitled\" to invest or \"act as investor\" than by \"authorized\", which may convey the idea that a specific approval or permission is required, a requirement not implied in the original version. It follows that \"investors\" under the Treaty are (1) \"natural persons\" with permanent residence or (2) \"juridical persons\" that have a seat in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and are entitled to act as an investor.\n\n206.\n\nJSW is not a \"natural person\". Thus, in order for it to fall within the scope of the Treaty, it must be (i) a \"juridical person\" (ii) that has its seat in \"the territory covered by\" the Treaty. Further, it must be entitled to act as an investor (iii). The latter two requirements - that JSW has its seat in Germany and that it be entitled to act as an investor - are not contested.105\n\nSee, for instance, SoD, \u00a7\u00a7146-71, alleging that JSW cannot be considered an \"investor\" because, under German law, a KG does not have legal personality and is not considered a \"juridical person.\" See also Rej., \u00a7167 stating that JSW is a limited partnership registered in Germany \"as a vehicle for the Wirtgen Claimants\u2019 investment in the Czech Republic\".\n\n207.\n\nBy contrast, the Parties disagree whether JSW is a \"juridical person\". The Respondent submits that the term \"juridical person\" must be understood by reference to German law. As German law does not confer legal personality to KGs such as JSW, JSW is not a \"juridical person\" for purposes of Article 1(3) of the Treaty. The Claimants object, stating that the term \"juridical person\" must be interpreted autonomously. As JSW can invest, conclude contracts, acquire property and sue and be sued in its own name, it must be deemed a \"juridical person\" within the meaning of the Treaty.\n\n208.\n\nTo resolve this dispute, the Tribunal must interpret Article 1(3) of the Treaty in which the term \"juridical person\" appears. For doing so, the Tribunal turns to the rules of interpretation of treaties contained in Articles 31106 and 32107 of the VCLT, which applies because both Czechoslovakia108 and Germany became parties to it in 1987, some three years prior to the conclusion of the Treaty in 1990. Accordingly, it will interpret Article 1(3) of the Treaty giving the term \"juridical person\" its ordinary meaning, in its context, and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty.\n\nAccording to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The starting point of the interpretation is the \"ordinary meaning\" of the text. The latter must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty\u2019s object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties.\n\nPursuant to Article 32 of the VCLT, one may resort to supplementary means of interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 or (ii) to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31 \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure\" or \"leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\".\n\nThe Czech Republic notified its succession to the VCLT on 22 February 1993 with effect as of 1 January 1993.\n\n(i) Ordinary meaning and context\n--------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe threshold question here is whether the term \"juridical person\" is to be interpreted by reference to German law as the Respondent suggests, or interpreted autonomously, as the Claimants propose. For the following reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the term \"juridical person\" is an autonomous or treaty-specific concept.\n\n210.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that the definition in Article 1(3) of the Treaty recognizes two kinds of investors. \"Natural persons\" who must have a \"permanent residence\" and \"juridical persons\" with a seat in a territory covered by the Treaty and entitled to invest. No recourse to national law is provided in respect of either type of investors.\n\n211.\n\nBy contrast, other provisions of the Treaty do refer to national law. Thus, Article 1(1) of the Treaty which defines the term \"investments\", expressly refers to the \"internal legislation\" of the Contracting States:109\n\n\"the term \"investments\" covers assets of any kind which are invested by investors from one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State *in accordance with the internal legislation of the respective other State.*\"\n\nExh. C-078.\n\n212.\n\nSimilarly, Article 2(1) of the Treaty which considers investment promotion and fair and equitable treatment, too contains an express reference to the Contracting States\u2019 domestic legislation:110\n\n\"Each Contracting State shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by investors from the other Contracting State and *admit such investments in accordance with its legislation*. Each Contracting State shall in every case accord investments fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\n*Id*.\n\n213.\n\nOther provisions of the Treaty also contain references to the Contracting States\u2019 domestic legislation. This is so in Article 7(1) (\"*If the legislation of either Contracting State* or international obligations existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting States in addition to this Treaty contain any provisions, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors from the other Contracting State to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Treaty, such provisions shall prevail over this Treaty to the extent that they are more favourable\"); Article 8 (\"This Treaty shall also apply to investments made since 1 January 1950 but prior to the Treaty\u2019s entry into force by investors from either Contracting State in the territory of the respective other Contracting State *consistent with the latter\u2019s legislation*\"); and paragraph 3(c) of the Protocol to the Treaty (\"Within the framework *of their internal legislation* [\u2026]\").\n\n214.\n\nIt is evident that when the Contracting Parties wished their municipal laws to govern, they included an express reference to this effect. In the absence of such reference, it is reasonable to conclude that the Contracting Parties intended to give a term a treaty-specific meaning \"for the purposes of this Agreement\", as the chapeau of Article 1 expressly states. It is not unusual for contracting states to give a term used in a treaty an autonomous meaning which may differ from its significance under national law. It is a technique used to achieve the uniform applications of a treaty. So for instance, terms used in the New York Convention in principle have an autonomous meaning.111 This conclusion is strengthened when one examines the object and purpose of the Treaty, as well as the relevant treaty practice which the Tribunal does below.\n\nICCA\u2019s Guide to the Interpretation of the 1958 New York Convention, p.13 (\"In principle, the terms used in the [New York Convention] have an autonomous meaning (Article 31 Vienna Convention.).\"\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal is sensitive to the Respondent\u2019s submission that tribunals should consider national law in interpreting treaty terms and that an express *renvoi* is not required. This is uncontroversial. It does not mean, however, that a tribunal should turn to national law in all cases. If it appears, taking into account the object and purpose112 of a treaty that the parties to it did not wish to give to the term used therein a particular or specific meaning which it may have in national law, but rather a general one, a treaty term can be interpreted independently from the national law of the parties to the treaty.\n\nThe object and purpose of a treaty can be ascertained in particular from its preamble. Here, the parties to the Treaty in its Preamble \"recogniz[e] that the encouragement and reciprocal protection of such investments are suitable means to strengthening all forms of economic activities, especially those associated with private enterprise\".\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal is equally sensitive to the Respondent\u2019s contention that \"a tribunal does not have authority to autonomously articulate rules for the creation or establishment of nationality\".113 This too is uncontroversial. The Tribunal certainly considers German law to identify the characteristics or attributes of a KG under the law of its constitution. Being so informed about national law, it must then examine whether an entity with the characteristics given by its national law falls within the autonomous concept of a \"juridical person\" under the Treaty.\n\nRej., \u00a7382.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that the term \"juridical person\" must be interpreted autonomously. The next question is for the Tribunal to determine what this term means.\n\n218.\n\nThe first thing that strikes the interpreter when reading Article 1(3) is the opposition between \"national persons\" on one side and \"juridical persons\" on the other. A \"juridical person\" is an \"artificial person\". However, such an artificial person can be an investor like a natural one. Hence, it must have similar legal attributes, such as the capacity to invest, enter into contracts, acquire property, and sue and be sued in its own name.\n\n219.\n\nThis understanding is confirmed when looking at dictionary definitions. For instance, The Legal Dictionary defines the term \"juridical person\" as:\n\n\"a body recognized by the law as being entitled to rights and duties in the same way as a natural or human person, the common example being a company\".114\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Juridical+person.\n\n220.\n\nThe *Abaclat* tribunal came to the same conclusion interpreting the same term \"juridical persons\", which also appears in Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention.115 It was faced with associations formed under Italian law, which under such law lack legal personality, but enjoy the attributes specific to legal entities:\n\n\"Based on the wording of Article 1(2)(b) BIT and the situation under Italian law, it has to be concluded that not only entities with full legal capacity qualify as \"juridical persons\" under Article 1(2)(b) BIT. Under Article 36 Italian Civil Code [\u2026] associations not recognized as legal entities (hereinafter \"non-recognized associations\") have the procedural capacity to stand in court and to be represented by their president or director. In other words, whilst non-recognized associations may not have legal personality, they possess certain attributes of legal personality and in particular the right to sue and to be sued. To the extent that the relevant Claimants had the capacity to make the relevant investment, and that they also have the statutory right to litigate in their own names, and that their constituents all have the requisite nationality, the \"juridical person\" requirement of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention must be considered satisfied\".116\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the Convention reads as follows: \"(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means: [\u2026] (b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State [\u2026]\".\n\n*Abaclat and Others v. the Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 4 August 2011 (\"*Abaclat*\"), \u00a7417(i).\n\n221.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that, under German law, KGs have legal capacity to invest, conclude contracts, acquire property, and sue and be sued in their own name.117 In the Tribunal\u2019s view and as will further be seen below, the fact that German KGs are not \"juristische person\" under German law does not alter this conclusion. Indeed, the reason for the lack of legal personality lies in the mode of creation of the entity. A corporation with legal personality comes into existence through registration, while a KG is constituted by agreement. Beyond this difference, the legal capacity of these entities is identical when it comes to entering into legal transactions, owning assets, or standing to sue or to be sued in court.118\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, \u00a747, stating that Claimant 4 is a limited partnership, and referring to Weipert, L., Handelsgesetzbuch (Commercial Code), Ebenroth/Boujong/Joost/Strohn, C.H. Beck, 2014, 3rd Edition, RLA-011 which sets out the rights and duties of a limited partnership (\"By becoming a limited partnership\u2014i.e., an exoteric partnership [an entity] acquires [\u2026] the ability (i) to acquire rights; (ii) to enter into liabilities, (iii) to acquire property and other in rem rights in real property; (iv) to file complaints before courts of law; and (v) to have complaints filed against it before courts of law\u2014all in its own name. Limited partnerships are, therefore, acknowledged by law as being a legally independent investment fund (Sondervermogen) of its collectively affiliated partners without being a legal person itself.\"); Reply, \u00a7139.\n\nSee Exh. RLA-009, Judgment of the German Federal Court of Justice dated 29 January 2001, II ZR 331/00, (\"It is therefore practically without contention that general partnerships (offene Handelsgesellschaften) and limited partnerships (Kommanditgesellschaften) are capable of being bearers of rights and duties and are, by extension, sui juris without the collective unit having the status of a legal person.\").\n\n222.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing discussion that the ordinary meaning of the term \"juridical person\" used in Article 1(3) of the Treaty taken in its context refers to an entity which can invest, enter into contracts, acquire property, sue and be sued in its own name.\n\n(ii) Object and purpose of the Treaty\n-------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nAfter the ordinary meaning and context, the Tribunal turns to object and purpose. The overall objects and purposes of the Treaty are set out in its Preamble, which provides that Germany and the Czech Republic enter into the Treaty to \"intensify economic cooperation between the two States\" and to \"create favourable conditions for investments by investors from either State in the territory of the other State\".119\n\nExh. C-078.\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Claimant 4 not being a \"juridical person\" is not an \"investor\" and thus cannot initiate an arbitration under Article 10 of the BIT. At the same time, the Czech Republic does not dispute that Claimants 1, 2 and 3 are the limited partners (Kommanditisten) of Claimant.120 Claimants 1, 2 and 3 have the capacity to make the relevant investment and also have the right to litigate in their own names. In other words, the Respondent contends that an entity (such as a KG) whose constituents are fully entitled to make a protected investment under the Treaty and who can both sue and be sued in their own name in respect of their investment, are not allowed to initiate an arbitration under the Treaty. The Tribunal does not see why this should be the case. As above, the object and purpose of the Treaty is not only to \"intensify economic cooperation\", but also to \"create favourable conditions for investment\". It would be contrary to the object and purpose of the Treaty to deny entities that have made protected investments under the Treaty the right to invoke protection for violation of the rights concerning such investments.\n\nExh.

KG), 9 May 2014; Exh. 025b, Excerpt from the Commercial Register for JSW Solar (zwei) Verwaltungs-GmbH, 9 May 2014; Exh. 025c, List of Shareholders filed with the Commercial Register for JSW Solar (zwei) Verwaltungs-GmbH, 15 July 2010.\n\n225.\n\nThe *Abaclat* tribunal came to the same conclusion in respect of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Spain BIT:\n\n\"Where a non-natural investor falls within the definition of juridical persons provided for in the BIT, and where such investor has under the law applicable to it the legal capacity to acquire an investment protected under the BIT and to sue and to be sued, it would be contrary to the purpose of the BIT and the ICSID Convention to deny such investor the capacity to initiate ICSID arbitration. Indeed, it would make no sense to allow on one hand an investor to make an investment protected under the BIT, and deny on the other hand such investor the right to invoke protection under the BIT for violation of the rights attached to such investment\".121\n\n*Abaclat,* \u00a7417(iii).\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Czech law also knows the concept of a KG. However, unlike German law, Czech law does not treat KGs differently from other corporate entities. Under Czech law, a corporate entity, entered into a register, be it a KG or another form, is considered a juridical person.122 Thus, if the Respondent\u2019s argument is followed, it would mean that a Czech KG investing in Germany would benefit from the protections of the Treaty, but a German KG investing in the Czech Republic would not. Such distinct treatment of German and Czech KGs would be contrary to the principle of reciprocal protection expressly stated to be the object and purpose of the Treaty as stated in the Preamble of the Treaty:\n\n\"recognising that the encouragement and reciprocal protection of such investments are suitable means to strengthening all forms of economic initiatives, especially those associated with private enterprise\".123\n\nReply, \u00a7137, relying on Exh. C-091, Letter of Rodl & Partner, advok\u00e1ti, k.s.to Mr [REDACTED] p.2, 2 December 2014.\n\nExh. C-078.\n\n227.\n\nMoreover, unlike in other treaties the object and purpose of which are neutral towards economic initiatives, the BIT\u2019s Preamble just quoted, expressly records the Contracting States\u2019 wish to strengthen \"all forms\" of economic initiatives, \"especially those associated by private enterprises\".\n\n228.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants\u2019 observation that one third of all German companies are KGs124 was not disputed. If the Respondent\u2019s arguments are followed, it would mean that one third of all private enterprises in Germany would not be covered by the Treaty. This can hardly be said to meet the object and purpose of the Treaty just stated. No cogent reason has been advanced why the Contracting Parties would have intended such a result.\n\nExh. C-097, Chart on Business Register.\n\n229.\n\nAn analysis of the ordinary meaning, context, and object and purpose of the Treaty leads the Tribunal to conclude that a \"juridical person\" in Article 1(3) is an entity with the legal capacity to invest, conclude contracts, acquire property and sue and be sued. It is not disputed that KGs have these attributes. Thus, KGs are \"juridical persons\" falling within the ambit of Article 1(3) of the Treaty. The supplementary means of interpretation provided in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, to which the Tribunal now turns, confirm this interpretation.\n\n(iii) Treaties with third States\n--------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on other treaties concluded by Germany in support of their respective submissions. The Respondent draws attention to the fact that Germany has entered into BITs that contain a broad definition of investor which includes German law partnerships like KGs.125 Hence, it argues that when \"[i]n accordance with the *effet utile* principle of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal must give effect to the express words of the Treaty in Article 1(3) by giving effect to the limitation inherent in this formulation for the definition of an \"investor\" for otherwise the express extension to German law partnerships in other investment treaties concluded by Germany would be rendered meaningless\".126 By contrast, the Claimants point out that the treaties invoked by Respondent are those in which the term \"investor\" is defined specifically for each contracting state. Therefore, they cannot be compared to this Treaty which has a single definition of investor for both Contracting Parties. They further note that some German BITs require that an entity be \"incorporated/organized\" under the laws of Germany,127 which purportedly shows that when German BITs are meant to refer to national law, they do so explicitly.\n\nExh. RLA-012, Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People\u2019s Republic of Bulgaria on the Mutual Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments of 12 April 1986 (\"any legal person and any partnership (Handelsgesellschaft), or other company and association with or without a legal personality having its seat in the territory to which this Treaty is applicable and lawfully existing under the laws regardless of whether the liability of the partners, shareholders, or members is limited or unlimited and whether its business is intended to be for profit or not\".).\n\nSoD, \u00a7170.\n\nExh. RLA-013, Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and Federal Republic of Brazil on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 21 September 1995 (\"legal persons, partnerships (Handelsgesellschaften), or other companies and associations with or without a legal personality, which (i) have their seat in the Sovereign Territory of one of the contracting parties and (ii) have been incorporated/organized under their legal regime regardless of whether their business is intended to be for profit or not and (iii) make any capital investment within the Sovereign Territory of the other contracting party.\").\n\n231.\n\nTreaties addressing the same subject matter entered into with third States may be of some assistance in the interpretation exercise. Tribunals in *Churchill Mining*,128*AAPL*129, *Plama*130*, Metal-Tech131 and ICS132* have for instance referred to other treaties concluded by the contracting parties with third States.\n\n*Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 February 2014 (\"*Churchill Mining*\"), \u00a7182 (\"Treaties on the same subject matter concluded [\u2026] with third States can legitimately be considered as part of the supplementary means of interpretation. For instance, in *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ had recourse to treaties on the same subject-matter concluded by one disputing party with third States. This approach also found resonance in investment treaty arbitration [\u2026]\".).\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Final Award, 27 June 1990 (\"*AAPL*\"), \u00a740.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005 (\"*Plama*\"), \u00a7195 (\"It is true that treaties between one of the Contracting Parties and third States may be taken into account for the purpose of clarifying the meaning of a treaty\u2019s text at the time it was entered into.\").\n\n*Metal-Tech*, \u00a7159.\n\n*ICS v Argentina **,*** Ad Hoc Arbitration, UNCITRAL Arbitral Rules, PCA Case No 2010-9, Award, 10 February 2012 (\"*ICS*\"), \u00a7296.\n\n232.\n\nHaving reviewed the German treaty practice invoked by the Parties with respect to the definition of the term \"investor\",133 the Tribunal makes the following observations:\n\n\u2022 While some German BITs contain a separate definition of \"investor\" for each Contracting State, 13 German BITs (including the German-Czech BIT) do not;\n\n\u2022 Out of these 13, two treaties (Germany-Poland (1989) and Germany-Russia (1989)) pre-date the Treaty and have definitions of \"investor\" similar to the one of the Treaty;134\n\n\u2022 9 of the remaining 10 treaties that post-date the Treaty contain language \"[association/organization] with or without legal personality\".135 The Germany-Mexico BIT employs an altogether different formulation speaking of \"commercial companies or other companies or associations\";136\n\n\u2022 All of the treaties examined that contain a separate definition of \"investor\" for each Contracting State whether they pre-date or post-date the Treaty, use the wording \"[association/organization] with or without legal personality\" within that definition.\n\nNeither Party supplied information on Czech treaty practice. Further, the Claimants submitted a table reproducing the various definitions of \"investor\" in some German BITs (Exh. C-094). The Respondent did not contest the correctness of this table.\n\nGermany-Poland BIT (\"The term \"investor\" shall mean a natural person with permanent domicile or a juridical person with its seat in the respective area of application of this Treaty, entitled to engage in investments.\"); Germany-Russia BIT (\"The term \"investor\" means an individual having a permanent place of residence in the area covered by this Agreement, or a body corporate having its registered office therein, authorized to make investments.\").\n\nGermany-Latvia (1993); Germany-Slovenia (1993); Germany-South Africa (1995); Germany-Macedonia (1996); Germany-Croatia (1997); Germany-Venezuela (1998); Germany-Thailand (2002); Germany-Ethiopia (2004); Germany-Guinea (2006).\n\nGermany-Mexico (1998): \"The term \"companies\" refers to any juridical person, as well as any commercial companies or other companies or associations, constituted or organized under the applicable law of a Contracting State whether or not for profit, whose territorial seat is located in the territory of any of the Contracting States.\"\n\n233.\n\nIt follows from these indications that German treaty practice changed after 1990, the year of the Treaty, to expressly include in the definition of \"investor\" the mention of \"associations/organizations with or without legal personality\". After 1993, the treaties examined with common definitions consistently use \"with or without personality\".137 This appears as an evolution of treaty drafting clarifying the meaning present in earlier BITs, rather than - as the Respondent suggests - a sign that Germany wished to exclude entities without legal personality from the ambit of the Treaty. No cogent reason is indeed advanced why German KGs investing in the Czech Republic would not benefit from treaty protection when German KGs investing in other countries would.\n\nExcept for Germany-Mexico BIT, which uses \"commercial companies or other companies or association\", which is a broader formulation.\n\n234.\n\nThus, German treaty practice confirms the meaning arising out of the ordinary meaning of the term \"juridical person\" in its context and taking into account the object and purpose of the Treaty.\n\n(iv) Decisions of other tribunals\n---------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nIn support of its submissions, the Respondent relies on the majority view of the tribunal in *Renta4*.138 There, the claimants were three Spanish investment funds and four variable stock companies. As the Russia-Spain BIT required that an \"investor\" be a \"corporate body\", and as the investment funds could not be considered \"corporate bodies\" under Spanish law, the tribunal declined jurisdiction over the funds.139 The Tribunal is unable to see the relevance of this decision to the present case.\n\n*Renta4 S.V.S.A. et al. v. Russia*, SCC Case No. 24/2007, Award on Preliminary Objections, 20 March 2009 (\"*Renta4*\"), \u00a7\u00a7121-31.\n\n*Renta4*, \u00a7\u00a7121-131.\n\n236.\n\nFirst, the definition of \"investor\" in the Spain-Russia BIT is materially different from that of the Treaty. It includes two references to domestic legislation (\"in accordance with the legislation of either Party\", \"under the legislation in force there\").140 As was discussed above, Article 1(3) of the Treaty does not refer to national law. Second, the Tribunal has reached its conclusion after conducting a thorough analysis. It has examined the context, object and purpose of the Treaty and considered the supplementary means of interpretation as well. In the circumstances, and in view of the materially different treaty provisions, this Tribunal cannot simply follow the views of the *Renta4* tribunal.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the Russia-Spain BIT: \"The term \"investor\" shall mean: [\u2026] (b) Any corporate body established in accordance with the legislation of either Party, domiciled in its territory, and allowed under the legislation in force there to make investments in the territory of the other Party.\"\n\n237.\n\nFor similar reasons, the dicta in *Impregilo*141 and *LESI*142 are unavailing as well.\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005 *(\"Impregilo\")**.*\n\n*Consorzio Groupement L.E.S.I.-DIPENTA v. People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08, Award of 10 January 2005 (\"*LESI*\"), \u00a7\u00a737 et. seq.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal does, however, agree with the conclusions of the tribunal in *Abaclat.* There, the tribunal was called to interpret the words \"persona jur\u00eddica\" (Spanish) or \"persona giuridica\" (Italian) found in the definition of the term \"investor\" in the Italy-Argentina BIT.143 The tribunal concluded that although some of the claimants were not \"persona giuridica\" under Italian law, they were nevertheless protected by the Italy-Argentina BIT as they could make investments, and litigate in their own name. While the wording in the Italy-Argentina BIT was admittedly broader than the one applicable in this case,144 the reasoning of the tribunal is enlightening to the extent it focuses on an entities\u2019 capacity to make investments and sue and be sued:\n\n\"With regard to the nature of the capacity necessary for corporations to benefit from the protection of the BIT and be a party to the present arbitration, the Tribunal is of the opinion that neither Article 1(2)(b) BIT nor Article 25 ICSID Convention limits the scope of eligible entities to those having full legal capacity, and also encompasses entities which enjoy limited civil capacity to the extent that such entities have the capacity to make an investment under the BIT and further to sue and to be sued\".145\n\nSpanish Original: \"2. El termino \u2014 \"inversor\" comprende toda persona f\u00edsica o jur\u00eddica de una Parte Contratante que haya realizado, realice o haya asumido la obligaci\u00f3n de realizar inversiones en el territorio de la otra Parte Contratante. Por \u2014 \"persona jur\u00eddica\" se entiende, con relaci\u00f3n a cada una de las Partes Contratantes, cualquier entidad constituida de conformidad con la legislaci\u00f3n de una Parte Contratante, con sede en el territorio de esa Parte y por esta ultima reconocida, tales como entidades p\u00fablicas que realizan actividades econ\u00f3micas, sociedades de personas o de capitales, fundaciones y asociaciones, independientemente de que su responsabilidad sea limitada o no.\"\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Abaclat*, \u00a7\u00a7416 et. seq.\n\n(v) Conclusion\n--------------\n\n239.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal holds that the term \"juridical person\" in Article 1(3) of the Treaty includes KGs. As a result, Claimant 4 is an \"investor\" under the Treaty. Consequently, the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection in respect of Claimant 4 must be rejected. The Tribunal does have jurisdiction over Claimant 4.\n\n240.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal need not address the Respondent\u2019s submission that Claimants 1-3 cannot assert the claims of Claimant 4. Similarly, the Claimants revised request for relief reproduced above [\u00a7146] has become moot. Accordingly, the Tribunal can dispense with ruling on the Respondent\u2019s objections to this revised request.\n\n**2. Does EU Law Deprive this Tribunal of Jurisdiction?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Commission\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the \"decisive question\" for this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is whether, on the day on which the Claimants filed the Request for Arbitration, the Czech Republic\u2019s offer to arbitrate contained in Article 10 of the Treaty was valid under public international law. The EC submits that the Respondent\u2019s offer was invalid for several reasons: first, because the Treaty as a whole must be regarded as terminated, since the conclusion of the Treaty on Accession of the Czech Republic to the EU implied the termination of the BIT pursuant to Article 59 of the VCLT; second, because the relevant provisions of the Treaty cannot be applied in light of Article 351 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\") as they are incompatible with the TFEU; and, third, because it results from the operation of the conflict rules in Article 30(3) of the VCLT.\n\n242.\n\nWhile these arguments have been rejected by other arbitral tribunals, the Commission submits that this Tribunal should undertake a \"fresh analysis\" as \"there are three new elements that those Arbitral Tribunals have either overlooked (the relevance of Article 351 TFEU), or that constitute new elements that could not have been known to them because they post-date the awards (the judgment of the ECJ in *Pringle*), or were not yet relevant for their decision (the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in particular the new exclusive competence of the Commission in the field of investment protection)\".146\n\nCommission\u2019s Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a775.\n\n**b. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the Treaty has been terminated due to the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the EU or rendered inapplicable due to the Lisbon Treaty. Investment tribunals, so say the Claimants, have repeatedly concluded that BITs remain in force following a State\u2019s accession to the EU. The Treaty grants specific protections to investors and EU law cannot interfere with either the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or those protections.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Contracting States have not terminated the Treaty. A third party such as the Commission cannot insist that the Treaty is terminated, nor can the Tribunal consider the Treaty terminated without hearing Germany. Moreover, the EU\u2019s acknowledgement that it has proceeded to the second step of the infringement procedure against five EU Member States for their failure to terminate their intra-EU BITs, \"underlines once again that the Intra-EU BITs are valid and can only be terminated by the contracting states\".147\n\nClaimants\u2019 communication of 14 November 2016.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants refute the Commission\u2019s submission that there is a conflict between the Treaty and EU law that affects the Treaty\u2019s validity. The Parties to the EU treaties and the BIT are distinct as are the protections provided. Other investment tribunals have come to the same conclusion.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the reliance on Article 344 of the TFEU is misplaced. First, Article 344 only applies between two Member States of the EU. It does not apply between a Member State and an investor. Second, as Article 344 is limited to issues of interpretation and as EU law only applies as fact in this case, \"any issue of interpretation, application or compatibility is irrelevant\".148\n\nClaimants\u2019 Comments on the Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a757.\n\n247.\n\nSimilarly, the Commission\u2019s invocation of Article 351 of the TFEU is inapposite. According to the Claimant, that provision applies to agreements between a Member State and a third country. Agreements concluded between a Member State and a State that only later becomes an EU Member are excluded.\n\n248.\n\nFinally, the Claimants also dispute that there is a conflict with EU competences. Article 2(2) of the TFEU provides that, where there is a shared competence, Member States may act, provided that the EU has not acted. The EU has not exercised its competence in a way that would deprive the investor of its rights and protections arising under the Treaty. As such, there is no conflict with the substantive provisions of EU law.\n\n**c. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nUnlike the Commission, the Respondent does not consider that the applicability of EU law deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction. Indeed, the Czech Republic \"does not join the Commission\u2019s objections to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\".149\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a74.\n\n**d. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n250.\n\nThis jurisdictional objection has not been raised by the Parties to the present dispute, but by the Commission, an *amicus curiae*. Ordinarily, it is not open to a non-disputing party to raise a defense of lack of jurisdiction. However, because the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction arises from a treaty as opposed to a contract, the Tribunal believes that it can and should review its jurisdiction *ex officio*.150 As a result, the Tribunal will address this objection.\n\nSee, for instance, *ICAO Council*, Judgment of 18 August 1972, ICJ Rep. 1972, p.52, \u00a713 (\"[T]he Court must [...] always be satisfied that it has jurisdiction, and must if necessary go into that matter proprio motu.\").\n\n251.\n\nArticle 10 of the Treaty sets out the Czech Republic\u2019s standing offer to arbitrate disputes with German investors. In the Commission\u2019s opinion, this provision has become inoperative upon the Czech Republic\u2019s accession to the EU in 2004, or, at the latest, when the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. The Tribunal notes that - as the Commission itself recognizes - its principal arguments are not new. They have been rejected by other arbitral tribunals.151\n\nSee among others *Binder v. Czech Republic*, Ad Hoc, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2007 (\"*Binder*\"); *Eastern Sugar B.V. v. The Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007 (\"*Eastern Sugar*\"); *Achmea* ; *Euram*. For a summary of the tribunals\u2019 treatment of the Commission\u2019s amicus arguments, see Exh. R-250, \"Further attempts by the European Commission to eradicate intra-EU BITs\", Volterra Fietta, October 2015.\n\n252.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s first objection is that the Treaty as a whole must be regarded as terminated pursuant to Article 59 of the VCLT. The Tribunal does not share this view. Article 59 of the VCLT provides the following rules applicable in a situation where a later treaty covers the same subject matter as an earlier treaty:\n\n\"1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter and: (a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or (b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\n\n2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intentions of the parties\".\n\n253.\n\nArticle 59 of the VCLT thus comes into operation only if *inter alia* the treaty under consideration and the later treaty have the same subject matter. In the present case, this means that Article 59 of the VCLT will only come into play if the Treaty and the TFEU relate to the same subject matter.152 This is obviously not the case. To take but one example, Article 10 of the Treaty allows an investor to sue a host state. No parallel provision exists in the TFEU.153 Similarly, EU law does not provide a protection similar to the FET found in the BIT entered into by the Czech Republic.154 Tribunals in *Eastern Sugar155* and *Oostergetel156* conducting a similar analysis came to the same conclusion.157 Both tribunals went on to observe that the other prerequisites for applying Article 59 were not met either.158\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the finding of the *Achmea* tribunal on the notion of \"identity\" in Art. 59 of the VLT: \"Nothing in Article 59 requires that the two treaties should be in all respects coextensive; but the latter treaty must have more than a minor or incidental overlap with the earlier treaty.\" *Achmea,* \u00a7242.\n\nSee for instance *Eastern Sugar*, \u00a7\u00a7164-165 (\"The BIT also provides for a special procedural protection in the form of arbitration between the investor state and the host state and, especially arbitration of a \"mixed\" or \"diagonal\" type between the investor and the host state, as in the present case [...] From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the arbitration clause is in practice the most essential provision of Bilateral Investment Treaties [...] EU law does not provide such a guarantee.\").\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the *Achmea* tribunal which observed the following in respect of the Dutch-Slovak BIT: \"The Tribunal does not accept the submission that the protection afforded by the BIT provision on fair and equitable treatment is entirely covered by [EU law]. Respondent does not allege that there is any principle of EU law that specifically forbids treatment that is not fair and equitable. The Tribunal does not consider that any such principle independent of concepts of non-discrimination, proportionality, legitimate expectation and of procedural fairness, is yet established in EU law.\" *Achmea*, \u00a7250.\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, \u00a7\u00a7159-160 (\"the Arbitral Tribunal does not accept the Czech Republic\u2019s argument that the EU treaty as the later treaty (as between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands) covers the same subject matter as the BIT, the earlier treaty. While it is true that European Union law deals with intra-EU cross border investment, say between the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, as does the BIT, the two regulations do not cover the same precise subject-matter.\").\n\n*Oostergetel*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 April 2010, \u00a774.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, \u00a7\u00a7167-168 (\"the Czech Republic has not established that the common intention of the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands was that the EU Treaty should supersede the BIT. Third, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that the BIT and the EU Treaty are not incompatible\"); *Oostergetel*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 April 2010, \u00a774 (\"there is no indication that the Parties would have intended for the BIT to be superseded by the EC Treaty [\u2026] the Tribunal does not see any direct conflict between the BIT and the relevant EU law provisions that would impede it from applying the two sets of legal norms simultaneously, should such a need arise.\").\n\n254.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s second objection is that the relevant provisions of the Treaty cannot be applied in light of Article 351 of the TFEU, which mandates the primacy of EU law in relation to international agreements. Here too, the Tribunal cannot follow this line of argument.\n\n255.\n\nArticle 351 of the TFEU (earlier Article 307 of the TEU) states that the EU treaties do not affect the international obligations of Member States assumed before a State\u2019s accession to the EU:\n\n\"The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Treaties\".\n\n256.\n\nIt is clear from such provision that Article 351 of the TFEU applies only to States. Here, the Claimants are not States. Further, the provision applies only between Member States and non-Member States. Here, both Germany and the Czech Republic are Member States. In the circumstances, Article 351 of the TFEU simply does not apply, and the Commission\u2019s argument must be rejected. The tribunal in *AES Summit* reached a similar conclusion.159\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erom\u00fc Kft v. The Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010 (\"*AES Summit*\"), \u00a77.6.10-7.6.11 (\"the Tribunal concludes that Article 307 [\u2026] is not applicable, as such, in this arbitration [\u2026] Article 307 only applies to agreements between member states and non-member states, and Hungary and the United Kingdom are both member states. Moreover, the Claimants are not states, and even if sometimes individuals are granted rights under international law, Article 307 of the EC Treaty specifies that it only applies to states.\").\n\n257.\n\nAs a further ground related to its second objection, the Commission submits that Article 10 of the Treaty is incompatible with Article 344 of the TFEU. Here too, the Tribunal does not agree. Article 344 TFEU reads as follows:\n\n\"Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein\".\n\n258.\n\nOn its face, this provision only applies to disputes involving two or more EU Member States. Further, Article 344 of the TFEU does not exclude the possibility of referring intra-EU investor-State disputes to international arbitration. As was held in *Mox Plant*, Article 344 prohibits EU Member States from submitting inter-State disputes regarding the interpretation and application of EU law to a method of settlement not contained in the EU Treaties. It does not prohibit the submission of investor-State disputes to another method of settlement not contemplated in the EU Treaties.160\n\nSee also for instance *Electrabel*, \u00a74,151 (\"there is no provision equivalent to Article 292 EC (now Article 344 TFEU) dealing with arbitration between two or more private parties, nationals of Member States, or with mixed disputes settlement mechanisms such as investor-state arbitration between individuals, nationals of EU Member States and an EU Member State under the ICSID Convention or other international instruments. Article 292 EC is not applicable to these arbitration tribunals\").\n\n259.\n\nThe third objection advanced by the Commission concerns the conflict rules in Article 30(3) of the VCLT. Here the Commission argues that specific provisions of the Treaty, including Article 10 (from which the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction) cannot be applied as they are incompatible with EU law, with the result that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the present case. Once again, the Tribunal disagrees. Article 30 of the VCLT reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under Article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty\".\n\n260.\n\nArticle 30(3) is thus concerned with the priority between particular provisions of an earlier and a later treaty, as opposed to Article 59 which deals with the termination of an entire treaty. While Article 30(3) may thus be triggered \"by the slightest incompatibility\", Article 59 requires that the earlier treaty be \"so far incompatible\" with the later treaty that both treaties cannot be applied at the same time.161\n\n*Achmea*, \u00a7\u00a7240-241.\n\n261.\n\nAs mentioned above, Article 10 of the Treaty is compatible with EU law, which is limited to inter-State disputes concerning the interpretation and application of EU law, and does not extend to investor-State arbitration as contemplated in Article 10 of the BIT. There is thus no question of incompatibility which would call for the application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT. The tribunal in *Binder v. Czech Republic*, which, like the Tribunal in the present case, was called upon to apply the provisions of the German-Czech BIT at issue here came to the same conclusion.162\n\n*Binder*, \u00a765 (\"The Arbitral Tribunal does not find either that Article 10(2) of the Czech-German BIT, which provides for a specific procedural protection in the form of arbitration between the investor and the host State, is in conflict with EC law.\").\n\n262.\n\nTribunals have repeatedly taken the view that the offer to arbitrate embodied in a treaty concluded between an EU Member State and a then Non-Member State which later acceded to the EU, i.e. an intra-EU BIT by virtue of accession, remained valid after the date of accession.163 The Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this line of cases. None of the \"three new elements\" advanced by the Commission serves to alter that position.\n\nSee, for instance, *Eastern Sugar* ; *Achmea* ; *Binder* ; *Oostergetel*, Decision on Jurisdiction of 30 April 2010.\n\n263.\n\nFirst, contrary to the Commission\u2019s submission, the operation of Article 351 of the TFEU (or its predecessor, Article 307 of the TEU) has not been \"overlooked\". As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, this Tribunal has considered and rejected its application. Other tribunals have done the same.164\n\nSee, for instance, *Electrabel*, \u00a74,178 et. seq.\n\n264.\n\nSecond, the Commission has not shown how the *Pringle* decision of 2012 would apply in the present case. The Tribunal understands that it only applies to the conclusion of future agreements between Member States. Since the Treaty has been in force since 1992, it is difficult to see how the decision could apply here, in the absence of any reason being provided to the contrary.\n\n265.\n\nFinally, the Commission points out that after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU has exclusive competence for concluding international agreements on investment protection. As a result, pursuant to Article 59 or Article 30(3) of the VCLT, the relevant provisions of the Treaty on which the present case is founded, are inapplicable and the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. The Tribunal has difficulty accepting this proposition. For Articles 59 or 30(3) of the VCLT to apply, the Commission would have to establish that the EU\u2019s new competence over \"foreign direct investment\" after the Lisbon Treaty covers the same subject matter as the Treaty. The Commission has not done so. In any event, as noted, one of the reasons for rejection of the Commission\u2019s intra-EU jurisdictional objections is that EU law contains no equivalent of the arbitration clause in the Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty has not changed this situation. Accordingly, for the same reasons as those mentioned above [\u00a7\u00a7252 et. seq.], the Commission\u2019s argument must be rejected.165\n\nThe tribunal in *WNC Factoring*, relying on *Eureko* reached the same conclusion (*WNC Factoring Limited v. The Czech Republic*, Award, 22 February 2017, \u00a7307).\n\n266.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Commission\u2019s arguments opposing this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction are not well-founded.\n\n267.\n\nIt follows from the analysis above that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute before it. The Tribunal must therefore review the merits of the dispute. It will first consider the Respondent\u2019s arguments in respect of the police powers doctrine (section (C) below) and then the Claimants\u2019 allegations in respect of the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Treaty (sections (D)-(E) below).\n\n**C. APPLICATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF POLICE POWERS**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is \"beyond doubt\" that obligations in investment treaties must be interpreted against the background of the doctrine of police powers in general international law. This doctrine, so says the Respondent, applies especially to measures of taxation such as the Solar Levy, in respect of which international law permits only a \"limited degree of scrutiny\".\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimants oppose the Respondent\u2019s submissions, contending first that as the Solar Levy effectively results in a reduction of the FIT, which the Czech Republic could not have otherwise achieved, the Solar Levy is not a good faith taxation measure. Further, the Claimants point to the lack of indications that the Contracting States intended protections offered by general international law, to restrict the application of the BIT. In any event, the Respondent cannot rely on the doctrine of police powers to justify its breaches of the Treaty, because the doctrine \"finds its limits [in cases] where the State has undertaken very specific commitments of stability\".166\n\nReply, \u00a7296.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes the Parties\u2019 disagreement on whether the Solar Levy is a \"good faith\" taxation measure. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the true nature of the Solar Levy would be relevant if the BIT contained a tax carve out ruling out or restricting the application of the treaty to tax measures. This is not the case, save for the limited exception in Article 3(4)167 which has no relevance here. In the absence of any cogent argument that the Treaty precludes the application of the umbrella clause, and the FET and FPS standards to tax measures, the Tribunal considers that it need not decide whether the Solar Levy is a \"good faith\" taxation measure or not. Further and in any event, the real nature of the Solar Levy is immaterial to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis. The dispute is principally on whether the relevant framework contains a stabilization commitment giving rise to legitimate expectations as claimed by the Claimants. As will be seen from the discussion that follows, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the applicable legal framework guarantees to solar PV investors a FIT level that provides (i) an adequate return on investment equal to at least 7% per year over the 15-year (later 20-year) life of the installation, and (ii) a payback of investment costs in no more than 15 years. These guarantees continue to be maintained in respect of the Claimants. This conclusion is indifferent to the characterization of the Solar Levy as a true taxation measure or otherwise.168\n\nArticle 3(4) of the Treaty: \"The treatment granted under this Article shall not relate to advantages which either Contracting State accords to investors from third States by virtue of an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation in the field of taxes on income and assets or other agreements regarding matters of taxation.\"\n\nThe Claimants agree. See Reply, \u00a7162 (\"[E]ven if the solar levy was considered a taxation measure, then it would still be fully subject to the Respondent\u2019s obligations under the BIT. The same applies to the Respondent abolishing the tax regulations which were part of the Support Scheme.\").\n\n271.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that the imposition of the Solar Levy - whether a true taxation measure or otherwise - did not affect the Claimants\u2019 revenue as a matter of fact. Indeed, while the grid operators continue to pay the FIT to solar RES producers, they do so after withholding the Solar Levy. Thus, while the Solar Levy as a matter of law did not directly reduce the FIT, the effect is that the Claimants\u2019 revenue is reduced by the amount of the Levy. The Constitutional Court came to the same conclusion,169 which the Respondent also accepts.170\n\nExh. R-084 \u00a745, (\"The Constitutional Court notes that although the provisions of Section 6 of Act No.180/2005 Coll., on Promotion of Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources and on Amendments to Certain Laws (Act on Promotion of Exploitation of Renewable Energy Sources), as amended by Act No. 137/2010 Coll., that set the amount of price of electricity from renewable sources and the amount of green bonuses were not affected by the amendments of Act No. 402/2010 Coll., there is no doubt that in consequence of the insertion of the new provisions of Section 7a and the following sections, which introduced the levy on electricity from solar radiation, this in effect changed the amount of support provided to operators of PVPP.\").\n\nTr. (Day 4) 680:9-16 (\"I think there is this lingering question of is the Solar Levy really any different from a FIT reduction? And, you know, it depends on who you ask; right? We accept that it has similar limits on a similar impact on the cash flows for the investor, except, of course, you know, a FIT reduction would apply permanently and reduce your cash flow, but here the Solar Levy applied for three years at the 26% level.\").\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal must apply the doctrine of police powers in its analysis, to which the Claimants object. Again, the Tribunal can dispense with resolving this issue.171 As already mentioned, the Tribunal is of the view that the regulatory framework contains no stabilization commitment of the content put forward by the Claimants. To reach this conclusion, the Tribunal need not to examine the status, role or applicability of the doctrine of police powers.\n\nThe Claimants appear to agree. Tr. (Day 1) 35:4-20 (\"Respondent contends that the introduction of the Solar Levy was a reasonable exercise of their regulatory power [\u2026] This defense is not only without merit, *it\u2019s also legally irrelevant*. We do not dispute that the State has the power to regulate for the good of its people. That\u2019s the purpose of a State but that power finds its limits in international law obligations (emphasis supplied).\").\n\n273.\n\nHaving addressed the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of police powers to excuse it from liability, the Tribunal will now examine the Claimants\u2019 submission that, by abrogating the Tax Incentives and introducing the Solar Levy, the Respondent violated Article 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment), Article 4(1) (full protection and security) and Article 7(2) (umbrella clause) of the Treaty.\n\n**D. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Article 2(1) of the Treaty requires a State \"[n]ot to deliberately cause damage to foreign investors; and [t]o protect their legitimate expectations relied on when investing\".172 The Respondent has breached both these aspects of Article 2(1) of the Treaty.\n\nSoC, \u00a7185.\n\n**a. The Respondent attracted and then deliberately harmed solar PV investors**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Support Scheme was created to attract foreign investors to the Czech Republic for the purpose of complying with the Republic\u2019s obligations under EU law. Once foreign investors had been attracted, the Respondent changed course and abrogated the Support Scheme. Doing so, it specifically targeted solar PV investors and required them to pay for a tariff deficit which was caused by the government\u2019s own prior actions. The Respondent\u2019s conduct was neither fair nor equitable.\n\n**b. The Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 submission that they legitimately expected to benefit from the Tax Incentives and the fixed FIT for at least 15 years. They relied on these expectations when making their investments. By abrogating the Support Scheme, the Respondent breached the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.\n\n277.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their legitimate expectations arose from the Support Scheme itself. Besides the terms of Article 6(1)(b), the 5% brake rule provided \"additional stability and an additional guarantee for investors that there would be no unexpected changes, and it strengthened the value of the tariff guarantee given in Article 6(1)(b) [of Act 180]\".173 In addition, the Claimants also rely on a series of public statements by senior government officials, explanatory notes to the relevant laws and official communications, all of which, they submit, affirmed the existence of the guarantees conveyed by the Support Scheme.\n\nTr. (Day 4) 630:18-21.\n\n278.\n\nIn answer to the Respondent, the Claimants specify that they do not claim that every statutory provision gives rise to legitimate expectations. Rather, their position is that the very specific, long-term guarantees contained in the Support Scheme did create expectations. They also clarify that they do not rely on political statements as the primary source of their legitimate expectations. Yet, these statements confirm the \"stability guarantee\" contained in the Support Scheme.\n\n**c. Specific guarantees or representations made to the Claimants**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Support Scheme is a \"very specific targeted legislation\". In order to receive the benefits of the Support Scheme, producers were required to follow a number of steps including obtaining construction permits, signing construction contracts, fulfilling technical requirements, and entering into contracts with grid operators. Addressed only to investors who built a solar plant authorized and licensed by the Respondent and connected to the grid within a certain year, the Support Scheme is \"the institutional equivalent of what [a] contractual stabilization clause would be, just in terms of modern regulation, where the actual contracts closing is delegated to private operators, in this case, the transmission system operators\".174\n\nTr. (Day 1) 30:2-7.\n\n280.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, through (i) the investors\u2019 right to choose between feed-in tariffs and green bonus, (ii) \"[o]fficial price setting by the ERO for specific plants\", (iii) grid operators\u2019 statutory duty to enter into contracts with qualifying RES producers, and (iv) ERO licenses, the \"Support Scheme\" created a \"system of reliance\", on which the Claimants precisely relied when making their investment.\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that the 2003 Explanatory Report issued by the Respondent \"confirms the already unambiguous wording of the Support Scheme and underscores \"that the profit\" for the energy sold to the grid operators \"shall be guaranteed for 15 years\"\".175\n\nReply, \u00a731.\n\n**d. The Solar Levy effectively ended the feed-in tariffs**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with the Respondent\u2019s submission that the feed-in tariffs remained intact in spite of the Solar Levy. Since grid operators are under an obligation to deduct the Levy from the payments due to the solar PV producers, the Claimants effectively receive 26% less than the amount to which they are entitled under Act 180. Through the Solar Levy, so say the Claimants, the Respondent has \"blatantly tried to mask a de facto reduction of the guaranteed feed-in tariffs\".176\n\nSoC, \u00a7214.\n\n**e. Guarantees in respect of taxation**\n----------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimants are in agreement that the tax exemptions already existed at the time when Act 180 entered into force. However, relying on the 2003 Explanatory Report issued by the Respondent, the Claimants submit that these incentives were made an \"integral part\" of the Support Scheme. The Claimants therefore legitimately expected \"that an exemption that is part of the Support Scheme is not suddenly amended to reduce the impact of long term price guarantees contained in the Support Scheme and thereby circumventing the actual benefits received under the Support Scheme\".177\n\nReply, \u00a766.\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimants also rebut the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimants could not rely on the prospective five year income tax exemption contained in Act 586/1992 Coll. on Income Tax (\"Act 586\"), because the Act was amended several times. They reply that only five amendments abolished tax exemptions and that none of these five amendments retroactively affected tax exemptions that were granted for a set period, save for the one presently in dispute. They maintain, therefore, that the abolition of the Tax Incentives was unprecedented.\n\n**f. Expectation to receive a 15-year payback**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nFor the Claimants, the 15-year payback is only one of three independent guarantees which ERO was to respect when setting the tariff for the following year. The other two were the set tariff and the 5% brake rule. ERO must comply with all three guarantees cumulatively, not, as the Respondent suggests, with only one to the detriment of the others. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s argument that the 15-year payback period was the \"operative basis\" of the Support Scheme is \"smoke and mirrors\". This term is not found in the law itself and is \"irreconcilable with the plain wording of the Support Scheme, the explicit intent of the legislator and the representations made by the Czech Republic at the time\".178 In fact, in its own documents, the Respondent made no mention of the 15-year pay-back guarantee as the \"operative basis\" of the Support Scheme.\n\nReply, \u00a76.\n\n286.\n\nThe Claimants further challenge the Respondent\u2019s position as incompatible with the purpose of Act 180, which was meant to attract private investment into renewables, thereby helping the Respondent meet its indicative EU targets for renewable energy. According to the Claimants, \"[n]o reasonable investor would have invested considerable sums of capital in a foreign country if they were only guaranteed a return of their investment within 15 years and nothing more\".179\n\nReply, \u00a736.\n\n**g. \"Windfall profits\"**\n-------------------------\n\n287.\n\nIn reply to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the drop in investment costs led to \"windfall profits\" for investors which could legitimately be curbed in order to alleviate budgetary constraints, the Claimants argue that there is no evidence that the Claimants benefited from that alleged drop. At least for the Claimants, the reduction of the feed-in tariff by 5% in 2010 meant that they only hypothetically benefited from a reduction in investment costs of around [REDACTED] %.\n\n288.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants deny that they received any \"windfall profits\". Their preamendment rate of return was between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] % compared to the 7% allegedly promised by ERO. For the Claimants, \"[t]his is not a case where the gold price escalated two or three times over the old price, increased six-fold within a couple of years only\".180 Furthermore, the level of the present rate of return is \"currently irrelevant\". After all, one cannot know what the situation will be in five or ten years -the plants may break down and there may be other technical issues.\n\nTr. (Day 4) 642:18-20.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute that they profited from the alleged price decrease in solar panels. The engineering, purchasing and construction contracts concluded between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] for the construction of the three PV plants specified the costs for the purchase of solar panels. The contracts show that the overall investment costs between 2009 and 2010 were reduced by only [REDACTED] % compared to the alleged [REDACTED] % price drop for solar panels.\n\n290.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent has failed to explain the link between the alleged windfall profits and the Solar Levy. In fact, the Explanatory Report to Act 402/2010 briefly mentioned a drop in investment prices, but did not correlate Solar Levy and \"windfall profits\". The real reason for the introduction of the Solar Levy, so say the Claimants, was that the Respondent considered solar power plants to be inefficient in relation to their cost.\n\n**h. Decisions of the Czech courts**\n------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimants object to the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the decisions of its local courts. They regard these decisions as irrelevant for the issues of international law which have to be decided here. The Claimants also point out that these decisions were rendered after the Respondent abrogated its guarantees. Therefore, any interpretation of the Support Scheme by the domestic courts \"[cannot] be reliably used to test Claimants\u2019 *ex ante* legitimate expectations\".181\n\nReply, \u00a744.\n\n**i. Tariff reduction in the [REDACTED] lease**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the tariff reduction provision in the [REDACTED] lease agreement (see below \u00a7330) is misguided. That provision was meant to address decreases in tariffs resulting from a failure to complete the [REDACTED] plant before the end of the calendar year. It is, therefore, inapposite to refer to it in the present dispute.\n\n**j. The Claimants\u2019 due diligence**\n-----------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Claimants oppose the Respondent\u2019s submission that they could have no legitimate expectations because they failed to conduct a proper due diligence (see below \u00a7\u00a7331 et. seq.). In any event, they contend that the Respondent has not explained what the Claimants ought to have discovered as part of their due diligence. In addition, the Claimants point out that \"none of the changes to the Support Scheme were foreseeable\".\n\n**k. Opinion of Ueltzhoffer Balada**\n------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nPrior to investing in the Czech Republic, the Claimants secured a legal opinion signed by Mr. Andreas Ueltzhoffer, a partner at the Czech law firm Ueltzhoffer Balada. On the letterhead of this firm, Mr. Ueltzhoffer confirmed to the Claimants that the principle of \"Bestandsschutz\" that prohibits retroactive changes in the law exists in Czech law. It was, *inter alia*, on the basis of this opinion that the Claimants eventually invested in the Czech Republic.\n\n295.\n\nIn answer to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimants should not have relied on the opinion of Mr. Ueltzhoffer because he is a German lawyer, the Claimants observe that the advice was given by the Czech law firm Ueltzhoffer Balada (now Ueltzhoffer Klett Jakubec & Partneri), which was authorized to advise on matters of Czech law. They note that, in a subsequent letter of 18 August 2015, Ueltzhoffer Klett Jakubec & Partneri confirmed that Mr. Jan Balada, the second partner of the law firm at the time, was a fully qualified legal professional under Czech law and therefore entitled to advise on matters of Czech law.\n\n296.\n\nThe Claimants add that, although the opinion was only signed by Mr. Ueltzhoffer, it was given on the official letterhead of the law firm in the name of the firm, Mr. Ueltzhoffer having signed because the opinion was issued in German.\n\n**l. State aid**\n----------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the legitimacy of their expectations cannot be questioned on the ground that the Support Scheme constitutes State aid. First, they contest that the Scheme can be characterized as State aid as it was initially financed by the ultimate consumers of electricity only. Second, they point out that, in its Decision, the Commission held that the Support Scheme was not incompatible with EU law on State aid.\n\n298.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants submit that what matters to assess their legitimate expectations is their knowledge when making the investment. At that time, there was no decision of the Commission declaring a feed-in tariff scheme to be incompatible State aid. In fact, while examining draft legislation which was later adopted as Act 180, the Commission itself concluded that the act would not constitute State aid. Further, in its 2003 Explanatory Report, the Czech Republic also considered that the Support Scheme was compatible with EU law.\n\n299.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Commission\u2019s submission that this Tribunal is bound by the Commission\u2019s decision on legitimate expectations is \"evidently nonsense\". The Commission does not have jurisdiction to decide this dispute.\n\n**m. The legislative changes were not foreseeable**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nFor the Claimants, the contested measures were not foreseeable. Four small German investors cannot be expected to foresee retroactive legislative changes which even the government had not contemplated. No information was publicly available on the retroactive changes at the time of the investments. Only one document dated November 2010 envisaged such a change, but at that time the Claimants had already made their investments. The only change discussed at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investment was the removal of the 5% brake rule, which is why the Claimants took efforts to get their plants online in 2010.\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that Mr. [REDACTED] admitted that ERO itself had no proper information available. It received details about the rise in capacity only in 2010. As the regulator itself did not have the relevant information, it was unreasonable to expect an investor to do so. The 2010 ERO Report only summarized ERO\u2019s activities in 2009 and explained ERO\u2019s efforts in abolishing the 5% brake rule. The retroactive changes were not addressed.\n\n302.\n\nIt is wrong, so say the Claimants, for the Respondent to draw a comparison with the changes introduced in the German solar PV framework. While it was true that the amendment to the German Renewable Energy Act was passed in August 2010 and entered into force retroactively as of July 2010, such amendment served to implement a decision of the Federal Supreme Court of December 2009. Thus, since December 2009, operators in the German PV sector knew that changes were likely. In any event, the Claimants emphasize that the German framework is different and cannot be compared with that of the Czech Republic.\n\n303.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that both ERO and the government should have taken action to inform investors of possible retroactive changes. Yet, no action was taken.\n\n**n. The Decision**\n-------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that, in its Decision, the Commission has commented on possible breaches of the FET standard of the Treaty. For the Claimants, these views are irrelevant as \"[t]he EU Commission has no jurisdiction to assess legitimate expectations of investors under the German-Czech BIT\".182\n\nClaimants\u2019 Comments on the Commission Decision, \u00a71.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent essentially submits that the Claimants have not established (i) that the Czech Republic made \"specific commitments\" that its laws would not change, (ii) that the Claimants reasonably relied on such alleged specific commitments when making their investment, and (iii) that the Czech Republic abrogated these alleged commitments when it introduced the challenged measures. As a result, the FET claims should be dismissed.\n\n**a. The Respondent did not deliberately attract PV investors**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Czech Republic denies the Claimants\u2019 suggestion that it deliberately attracted PV investors in order to fulfill its obligations *vis-a-vis* the EU. Solar power is by far the most expensive source of renewable energy. Therefore, the legislature could never have anticipated that Act 180 would prompt any significant growth in the production of solar energy. The Explanatory Report to Act 402/2010 emphasized that the environmental conditions in the Czech Republic were unsuitable for solar generation and instead envisioned growth in other RES like wind mills. Further and in any event, the 8% target had already been superseded by a new target for 2020, and \"it is hardly plausible that the Czech Republic would have intentionally committed electricity consumers and taxpayers to pay enormous subsidies for a period as long as 20 years simply to achieve a non-binding target\".183\n\nRej., \u00a75(f).\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Act 180 was intended to provide cost-efficient subsidies for investment in renewable energy sources. Thus, the Claimants\u2019 \"core\" premise, i.e. that the Czech Republic deliberately attracted \"large investments\" into the PV sector and then \"shortchanged\" the investors once this goal was attained, is not correct. The Czech Republic never sought to attract foreign investors to investment in solar RES production in the first place.\n\n308.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Czech Republic required solar investors to pay for a tariff deficit which was caused by the government\u2019s own actions, the Respondent submits that austerity measures designed to protect the State budget - in and of themselves - cannot constitute a violation of the FET standard. Moreover, the Claimants\u2019 argument effectively turns that standard into a mechanism by which investors can defeat any tax assessment, and that cannot be correct. States enjoy the sovereign right to change domestic laws, so long as such changes are not manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable, or discriminatory. The fact that, in retrospect, some aspects of the regulation proved difficult to manage does not mean that the Czech Republic acted wrongly.\n\n**b. The Claimants\u2019 expectations**\n----------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent submits that, EU law being part of the applicable law under the Treaty, the legitimate expectations standard under the Treaty must be interpreted in line with that standard under EU law. If the Treaty were to provide for a different standard than that known in EU law, then the latter should prevail.\n\n310.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent submits that the measures complained of did not breach the Treaty because they did not violate a stabilization commitment owed to the Claimants or legitimate expectations held by them, and because the measures were reasonably tailored to achieve legitimate State objectives. For the Respondent, \"[i]nvestment treaties [are not intended] to protect investors from what is properly business risk; to serve as the functional substitute of a stabilization clause or to fetter the power of [a] State to adopt rational and proportional measures in the public interest\".184\n\nRej., \u00a79.\n\n311.\n\nTo give rise to legitimate expectations, so says the Respondent, statements must be \"clear\", \"definitive\" and \"unambiguous\". This is not so here. The Solar Levy did not change the feed-in tariffs and, therefore, the question of stabilization does not arise. As for the Tax Incentives, \"the 2003 Explanatory Report simply cannot be read as a promise to investors to maintain the [tax exemption], and it makes no mention at all of depreciation\".185 In addition, neither the Income Tax Act nor the 2003 Explanatory Report were \"specific\" to the Claimants.\n\nRej., \u00a7437.\n\n312.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent points out that Section 6(1) of Act 180 begins with the words \"[t]he Office\" which is a reference to ERO. It then specifies the tariff-setting framework which ERO is bound to apply. Contrary to the Claimants\u2019 assertions, Section 6 contains no commitment that such section will not be amended. Nor does it include a stabilization guarantee guarding against other changes in law. The contested measures were adopted through primary legislation and did not involve an amendment of Section 6 of Act 180.\n\n**c. Specific guarantees or representations made to the Claimants**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it provided specific guarantees or representations to the Claimants. More specifically, it refutes the Claimants\u2019 argumentation as follows:\n\n(i) Choice of two forms of subsidies\n------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is difficult to discern anything \"specific\" about the right of eligible RES investors to choose between tariffs and green bonus, a choice which was open to all investors.\n\n(ii) ERO price decisions\n------------------------\n\n315.\n\nContrary to the Claimants\u2019 submissions, the Respondent is of the view that the ERO price decisions were not issued \"for specific plants\", but merely for different categories of RES plants, depending on the date of commissioning, the method of production of electricity, and the size of the plant.\n\n(iii) Contracts with grid operators\n-----------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nFor the same reasons, argues the Czech Republic, the contracts with the grid operators are also unhelpful to the Claimants\u2019 case. These contracts do not relate to the feed-in tariffs at all. They contemplate connections to the grid and the producer\u2019s entitlement to supply electricity. Moreover, the counterparty to the contract was one of the three regional grid operating companies, not the State.\n\n(iv) ERO licenses\n-----------------\n\n317.\n\nSimilarly, continues the Respondent, the ERO licenses issued to the producers do not assist the Claimants either. The licenses only list details, such as the license holder\u2019s address, the name of the responsible representative, and the installed capacity of the plant. They do not confer on license holders any right other than the right to generate electricity. They do not mention the entitlement to the feed-in tariffs or to other elements of the Support Scheme. Their general format is universal, not specific to any particular license holder.\n\n(v) Other documents\n-------------------\n\n318.\n\nFinally, according to the Respondent, most of the other documents relied upon by the Claimants are not contemporaneous with the Claimants\u2019 investment. More importantly, the Claimants do not allege that they reviewed any of them prior to making their investment. In any event, none of these documents contain specific assurances or \"guarantees\" given by the Czech Republic.\n\n**d. The Solar Levy did not end the feed-in tariffs**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that the Solar Levy impacts the cash flows of PV producers such as the Claimants. However, it does not agree that the Solar Levy ended the feed-in tariffs altogether. First, the Solar Levy applied at the 26% level for three years only, when a tariff reduction or suppression would apply permanently. Second, there is a difference from the perspective of the State budget, in the sense that, the general budget benefits from the revenues from the Solar Levy, but not from a reduction in tariffs. Third, there is also a difference from the perspective of the electricity consumers, as a cut in tariffs would reduce the burden on electricity consumers, which was not directly the case with the Solar Levy.\n\n**e. Guarantees in respect of taxation**\n----------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nContrary to Claimants\u2019 submissions, the Respondent submits that neither Act 180 nor its implementing regulations specified any limitations on the taxation of RES producers. The Tax Incentives were part of the Income Tax Act for more than a decade before Act 180 entered into force. Nothing in the Czech legislation excludes or limits the legislator\u2019s ability to amend the Income Tax Act. In reality, it is amended frequently.\n\n321.\n\nThe Czech Republic also observes that there is nothing \"unprecedented\" about withdrawing tax exemptions. For instance, Act No. 338/1992 Coll., on Real Estate Tax provided a 15 year property tax exemption for owners of new dwellings who used them for permanent residence. That exemption, which existed since 1993, was subsequently withdrawn without providing any exceptions for existing homeowners.\n\n322.\n\nThe Respondent further draws attention to the fact that the only basis for the Claimants\u2019 position that they received guarantees in respect of taxation is (i) a single sentence in the 2003 Explanatory Report and (ii) the words \"'tax holiday' - 1 + 5 years\" in an October 2006 presentation by an ERO official at a workshop dedicated to the promotion of biogas. For the Respondent, neither of these documents is equivalent to a guarantee restricting the fiscal powers of the Czech legislature. Further and in any event, both the 2003 Explanatory Report and the ERO presentation were publicly available, and the Claimants have not alleged that they reviewed, let alone relied on these documents prior to investing in the Czech Republic.\n\n**f. Expectation to receive a simple return on investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the 15-year payback period was the operative basis of the Support Scheme. In its submission, two benchmarks must be considered in this connection: (i) an adequate return over the useful life of the investment (also referred to as \"reasonable profit\") and (ii) a simple return of capital expenditure within 15 years (also referred to as \"payback\"). Both benchmarks were met under the Support Scheme and continue to be met despite the Solar Levy and the changes to the income tax regime. In fact, the Claimants\u2019 plants continue to be profitable despite the adoption of the impugned measures.\n\n324.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the Claimants\u2019 position that nothing in the Support Scheme limits the returns of PV producers. It points to the Technical Regulation which sets the tariff as a function of costs to enable an adequate return, defined as a function of the WACC. For the Respondent, \"any sophisticated investor who did adequate legal due diligence would have seen those references to the WACC and to the reasonable rate of return, and would not have assumed that they had no limit on the returns\".186\n\nTr. (Day 1) 63:16-20.\n\n325.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 only legitimate expectation could have been to receive a 15-year return on their investment, an expectation which was met. The Solar Levy was set at 26% to maintain the 7% rate of return over the 20-year useful life of the plant in accordance with the criteria specified in the Technical Regulation. With the Solar Levy, it was estimated that the payback would be achieved in approximately 11 years, considerably less than the 15-year period mentioned in Section 6 of Act 180.\n\n326.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent argues that Section 6(1)(b)(1) of Act 180 directed ERO to set the tariff \"so that [...] there is attained [...] a fifteen year payback period on capital expenditures [...]\"187, which was the key to setting the appropriate tariff. The highest courts in the Czech Republic too found that under Act 180, the Claimants could legitimately expect a \"simple return\" of investment, i.e., a full return of capital, without profit. In fact, a reference to a guarantee of \"reasonable profit\" in addition to the 15-year return of capital contained in an early version of the draft Act was not taken over in the final version.\n\nSoD, \u00a7\u00a729-31.\n\n**g. \"Windfall profits\"**\n-------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that it introduced the Solar Levy on revenues of solar plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010 to partially offset the State\u2019s direct contribution to the costs of renewable electricity subsidies. The Solar Levy curtailed only the producers\u2019 windfall profits, leaving intact the guarantee of return contemplated in Act 180 and related regulations. The Tax Incentives too were revoked as part of a broader set of austerity measures, especially in light of the high profits earned by producers. In any event, the Respondent was under no obligation to maintain the existing tax regime.\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the Solar Levy or the revocation of the Tax Incentives breached any legislative promise or guarantee. To the contrary, these measures \"struck an appropriate balance between protecting the long-term profitability of [\u2026] investments and the interests of other investors, consumers and the public at large\".188 They were carefully calibrated to preserve the original payment guarantees, as well as to provide a reasonable profit level over the 20-year life of the PV plants. Indeed, the tariff rate remained unaffected. Contrary to the Claimants\u2019 arguments, the challenged measures merely did \"align profitability closer to the regime\u2019s original target and the level of return deemed acceptable for other regulated activities\".189\n\nRej., \u00a75(k).\n\nRej., \u00a75(j).\n\n**h. Decisions of the Czech courts**\n------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent submits that most of the Claimants\u2019 submissions in respect of legitimate expectations, legal stability, non-retroactivity, and the alleged lack of justification of the challenged measures were exhaustively heard - and rejected - by the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Administrative Court. While conclusions under domestic law are not determinative for the Tribunal, the rationale of the Czech Courts is nonetheless relevant.\n\n**i. Tariff reduction in the [REDACTED] lease**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the operator of the [REDACTED] plant, [REDACTED], and the local municipality agreed on a risk-sharing provision applying to a scenario in which feed-in tariffs would fall by over [REDACTED] % during the term of the lease.190 For the Czech Republic, the existence of such a provision shows that the Claimants knew that the feed-in tariffs could be reduced at any time.\n\nExh. R-241, Lease agreement between [REDACTED] and the city of [REDACTED], 5 March 2010, Article IV(7) (\"If at any time during the term of this lease [i.e., approx. 20 years] the feed-in tariff applicable to the electricity produced in the PV plant shall be decreased by more than [REDACTED] %, as compared to the feed-in tariff in effect when this lease had been concluded, i.e. the feed-in tariff announced in the ERO Price Decision for the year 2009, the Lessee shall be entitled, subject to delivering a prior written notice to the Lessor, to demand a pro rata reduction of the amount of the agreed rent for the future, or to rescind this agreement.\").\n\n**j. The Claimants\u2019 due diligence**\n-----------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the Claimants had no prior experience in the solar PV sector. Had they acquired a proper understanding of the legal framework or given due regard to the circumstances at the time, they would not have formed the expectation that they would continue to benefit from excessive profits without any regulation limiting these profits.\n\n332.\n\nThe due diligence undertaken by the Claimants before investing in the Czech PV sector was, so says the Respondent, \"woefully inadequate or non-existent\". The decision to invest was based solely on: \"(1) marketing materials provided by, and discussions with, a representative of a Spanish company that had no prior experience in the Czech solar market and little knowledge of the country\u2019s legal environment; (2) a one-and-a-half page legal opinion on Czech law signed by a German lawyer; and (3) Claimants\u2019 overall 'good experience with the Czech Republic'\".191\n\nRej., \u00a7169.\n\n333.\n\nAccording to the Czech Republic, had the Claimants carried out a proper due diligence exercise, they would have understood that the legislative and regulatory framework gave no guarantee of profitability, apart from seeking to ensure a 15-year return of capital and a reasonable profit for plants that met the parameters set. In particular, no guarantee was given that solar investments would not be subject to changes in taxation. Through a proper due diligence, the Claimants would have also discovered that the Support Scheme was out of balance with its underlying objectives, and that significant changes were thus likely.\n\n334.\n\nThe Respondent additionally notes that the Claimants\u2019 own Czech counsel (i) acknowledged the unexpected fall in the price of solar panels, (ii) noted that the feed-in-tariffs would be modified to adapt to economic conditions; and (iii) warned about the possibility of further changes in the law. What is more, the Claimants themselves were skeptical about the advice they received from their lawyers. For instance, even though the Claimants were told that the feed-in tariffs would remain in place for 20 years, they used a shorter period of 15 years in their business forecasts.\n\n**k. Opinion of Ueltzhoffer Balada**\n------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the one and a half page opinion prepared by Mr. Ueltzhoffer does not suggest that the Claimants\u2019 investment would be free from regulation. The opinion says nothing of substance about the 'Bestandsschutz' or about its potential application to the measures at issue. Further, the Claimants could derive no expectation of \"legislative stasis\" from a statement about the Czech legal system by a German lawyer not qualified to give advice on Czech law. In fact, Mr. Ueltzhoffer was not even authorized to provide legal advice on matters of Czech law and could not be presumed to meet the conditions required to qualify as a Czech lawyer.\n\n336.\n\nThe letter from Ueltzhoffer, Klett, Jakubec & Partneri (the successor firm to Ueltzhoffer Balada) of August 2015 does not assist the Claimants. It has no evidentiary value as its authors have not presented themselves as experts or witnesses. Furthermore, Mr. Ueltzhoffer claims that his earlier advice was validly given because it was on the letterhead of Ueltzhoffer Balada, a \"general partnership\", and must be regarded as legal advice provided by the firm. Yet, Ueltzhoffer Balada is an \"association (sdruzen\u00ed)\", which lacks legal personality. As such, it cannot itself practice law. Finally, under Czech law, the presumption is that foreign registered lawyers like Mr. Ueltzhoffer do not have the necessary experience and knowledge in matters of Czech law.\n\n**l. State aid incompatible with EU Law**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Decision makes clear that the Support Scheme constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the TFEU. The Claimants\u2019 submissions to the contrary must thus be rejected.\n\n338.\n\nThe Czech Republic further submits that, in its Decision, the Commission found that the Support Scheme constituted \"unapproved\" State aid since it was introduced in 2006. The Commission further found that under EU law, there was no \"right\" to State aid and no legitimate expectation to receive unapproved State aid.\n\n339.\n\nUnder EU State aid law, so says the Respondent, the Czech Republic is prohibited from paying subsidies to solar investors in excess of their cost of capital. Thus, beneficiaries of State aid - like the Claimants - cannot \"invoke any 'legitimate expectations\u2019 to claim entitlement to more aid than currently granted\".192 The Commission held that the level of State was admissible only because it took into account the Solar Levy, the tax exemption and the reduced depreciation periods. Had it not done so, the \"approval of the State aid by the Commission likely would have been impossible\".193\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the Commission Decision, \u00a731.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the Commission Decision, \u00a719.\n\n340.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the Claimants are sophisticated businessmen with access to specialist legal advice. They cannot ignore EU State aid law. By investing in a subsidized regime within the EU, the Claimants accepted the risk that this regime may be contrary to EU law.\n\n341.\n\nThe Czech Republic also argues that the Claimants have not shown that they invested on the basis of assurances that the Support Scheme would not be characterized as incompatible State aid. The 2003 Explanatory Report dates from a time well before the Claimants\u2019 investment and was not addressed specifically to the Claimants. In any event, there is no evidence that the Claimants even reviewed the Report before investing in the Czech Republic. Further, the 2003 Explanatory Report was based on the Czech Republic\u2019s then understanding of State aid, which has since been considerably clarified.\n\n342.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 reliance on the Czech Republic\u2019s views in 2003 as to the characterization of the Support Scheme under State aid law was misguided. State aid is an EU matter which the Czech Republic lacks the competence to assess. The Czech legislators are not the \"competent authority\" and their statements cannot give rise to legitimate expectations in this respect.\n\n**m. The legislative changes were foreseeable**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondent first submits that the impugned measures were not retroactive. It notes that, in its Decision, the Commission expressed the same view.\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimants are said to have misunderstood the Respondent\u2019s case on foreseeability: \"[t]he Czech Republic has never argued that the Solar Levy was specifically foreseeable prior to middle of 2010\".194 Rather, the Respondent\u2019s position is that \"investors who invest in a regime involving subsidized regulated tariffs must understand that regulatory intervention is possible to recalibrate a regime if it is known to be in imbalance with the purpose of the law\".195\n\nTr. (Day 4) 662:6-8.\n\nTr. (Day 4) 662:9-12.\n\n345.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, an imbalance did exist: the reasonable rate of return set out in the Technical Regulation was 7% per year over 20 years. Therefore, in respect of any solar installation commissioned after 1 January 2008, ERO sought to achieve (i) a reasonable rate of return equal to 7% per year over the 20-year life of the installation, and (ii) a payback of justified investment costs in no more than 15 years. However, the solar boom in combination with the 5% brake rule made it impossible for ERO to comply with these benchmarks, resulting in faster payback and higher rate of return for solar installations commissioned in 2009-2010. In these circumstances, the Claimants should have foreseen changes in the regulatory regime.\n\n**n. The measures taken by the Czech Republic were reasonable**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent finally insists that the measures at issue were taken after earlier measures had failed to stop the ever-increasing investments in the solar sector. By late 2010, the Czech Republic was suffering from the effects of the global financial crisis and had a serious budget deficit. Given the Republic\u2019s efforts to put an end to the solar boom as quickly as possible, at the time they invested, the Claimants \"could not have had any legitimate expectations of legislative stasis\".196 This is all the more true as there was then a moratorium on new connections.\n\nRej. \u00a75(e).\n\n347.\n\nFor the Respondent, a State measure is \"reasonable\" if it \"bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy\". In assessing \"reasonableness\", two elements must be considered: \"(1) the existence of a rational policy; and (2) the reasonableness of the act of the state in relation to the policy\".197 Here, the measures taken by the Czech Republic were reasonable.\n\nRej., \u00a7455.\n\n348.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, \"[g]iven the significant 'mismatch of production and subsidies for PV', it was entirely rational for the Czech Republic to craft measures aimed at correcting the system and easing the burden on consumers. The solution adopted by the Czech Republic was appropriately tailored because it (1) allowed investors to continue making reasonable returns on their investments; (2) taxed only the \"windfall\" profits (i.e., those profits that were above the reasonable level of return), in an effort to mitigate the effects upon consumers, and the economy generally; (3) leveled the playing field among all RES producers generally; and (4) leveled the playing field among solar energy producers specifically (by targeting the amendments at the groups that were receiving the largest windfalls)\".198\n\nRej., \u00a7462 (internal citations removed).\n\n349.\n\nThe Czech Republic also acted reasonably to rectify the good faith mistake in the mechanism established to calibrate the RES subsidies, the mistake being the 5% limit on FIT decreases for the solar plants commissioned in the following year. Moreover, rather than applying a blanket measure to all RES producers or to all PV producers, the Respondent carefully recalibrated the Support Scheme to target only those producers who benefited from the \"greatest imbalance\" between subsidy and costs.\n\n350.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the \"realignment\" of the Support Scheme was needed not only to respond to surging energy prices in circumstances of \"economic turmoil\", but was also needed to avoid overcompensation contrary to EU State aid law. This can hardly be considered arbitrary or unreasonable. Indeed, the Treaty cannot be interpreted as requiring the Czech Republic to maintain support to solar RES production contrary to its international obligations under EU law.\n\n**o. The Decision**\n-------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Respondent finally submits that, in its Decision, the Commission considered whether the impugned measures breached the FET standard under the Treaty. The Commission concluded that there was no violation, a conclusion which this Tribunal should reach as well.\n\n**3. The Commission\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nOn its part, the Commission submits that the Czech Republic has not violated its obligations under the Treaty. This is because under EU law, an investor cannot have legitimate expectations with regards to future payments of State aid, save in exceptional circumstances.\n\n353.\n\nThe Commission observes that producers of renewable energy had argued before the Commission that it should not approve the contested measures on the basis of Article 108(3) TFEU, or else it would violate the general principle of legitimate expectations under Union law and the Energy Charter Treaty, which forms part of Union law. These arguments were rejected. If renewable energy producers like the Claimants so wished, they could challenge the Decision before the Courts of the EU.\n\n**4. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n354.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"Each Contracting State shall in every case accord investment fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\n355.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Claimants allege that by abrogating the Tax Incentives and introducing the Solar Levy, the Respondent breached Article 2(1) of the Treaty.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the claims under Article 2(1) of the Treaty are based on \"the protection of Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations\" and on \"the obligation not to deliberately cause harm to Claimants\u2019 investments\".199 The Claimants have not precisely challenged the impugned measures as being arbitrary or discriminatory.\n\nReply, \u00a7216.\n\n357.\n\nBefore analyzing the Parties\u2019 arguments ((c) and (d) below), the Tribunal considers it useful to set out its understanding of the guarantees provided in Act 180 ((a) below) and describe the circumstances in which the contested measures were introduced ((b) below).\n\n**a. Act 180**\n--------------\n\n358.\n\nAs mentioned above, Act 180 was adopted in March 2005 to support the production of electricity from all forms of RES sources through tariff and non-tariff measures.\n\n359.\n\nSection 6(1) of Act 180 starts by providing that the ERO will set the \"buy-out price\" or FIT,200 for solar RES one calendar year in advance in the following terms:\n\n\"Level of the prices for the electricity from the renewable sources and the green bonuses\n\n(1) The Authority defines the buy-out prices for the electricity from the renewable sources (hereinafter referred to as the \"buy-out prices\") separately for individual types of the renewable sources and the green bonuses always for the calendar year in advance in such way that [\u2026]\"201\n\nThe Claimants understand the term \"buy out price\" to refer to the FIT. See SoC, \u00a7206 (\"Pursuant to Section 6(1) of Act 180, this guaranteed feed-in tariff (in the Act given the term \"buy-out prices\") [\u2026]\".).\n\nExh. C-031, Claimants\u2019 Translation of Article 6 of Act 180.\n\n360.\n\nSubsection 6(1)(a) then stipulates that the buy-out prices or FIT must be set to allow the Czech Republic to meet its indicative target of 8% of energy from renewable sources out of the total electricity production by 2010:\n\n\"[\u2026] conditions are created for the fulfilment of the indicative target of the share of the generation of the electricity from the renewable sources in the gross consumption of the electricity amounting to 8 % in the year 2010 [\u2026]\"202\n\nExh. C-031, Claimants\u2019 Translation of Article 6 of Act 180.\n\n361.\n\nSubsection 6 (1)(b) then provides that the \"buy-out price\" or FIT for solar RES must be such that the solar PV plants that fulfil technical and economic parameters can achieve a \"return of investment\" in 15 years. It identifies some of these parameters, and refers to the implementing regulation for others:\n\n\"b) for the devices put into operation\n\n1. after the date of the effect of this Act, the fifteen-year period of time of return of investment is reached with support of the buy-out prices under the condition of the fulfilment of the technical and economic parameters, that are especially the costs for the installed unit of the output, the efficiency of the use of the primary content of the energy in the renewable source and the period of time of the use of the device and that are defined in the implementing regulation [\u2026]\"203\n\n*Id.,* Section 6 (1)(b)(1).\n\n362.\n\nThe \"implementing regulation\" mentioned in Section 6(1)(b) refers to the Technical Regulation, which reads as follows:\n\n\"In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured through the support by Purchasing Prices of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and economic parameters of an installation producing electricity from renewable sources must be satisfied, where the producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve, with the given level of Purchasing Prices\n\na) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the installation, such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and\n\nb) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero.\"204\n\nExh. R-013. Technical Regulation, Section 4(1).\n\n363.\n\nIn other words, the Technical Regulation provides that the FIT called here \"Purchasing Prices\" must be set at a level that ensures a return of the investment in 15 years (a) with an \"adequate return\" determined on the basis of WACC (b).\n\n364.\n\nThe methodology for calculating such adequate return is in turn contained in the ERO Methodology available on the ERO website, which reads as follows:\n\n\"When determining purchasing prices [the ERO] proceeds on the basis of the fundamental rules stipulated in [Act 180] and related implementing legal regulations.\n\n1.1 Methodology for deriving purchasing prices\n\nPurchasing prices for electricity are set for individual types of RES [\u2026] from data on reference projects. [\u2026]\n\n1.2 Input data for projects - breakdown\n\n[\u2026] Useful life period and replacement period for parts of investments\n\nThe minimum prices are calculated for the period of the useful life of the relevant investments. Such useful life period is stipulated for individual kinds of RES in the ERO Decree No. 475/2009 Coll., which implements certain provisions of [Act 180]\n\n1.3 Assumptions concerning common economic parameters in the calculations\n\n[\u2026] Discount rate - return on capital\n\nThis is a key assumption. The methodology used assumes an after-tax WACC of 7%, used as the discount rate (the IRR of projects = 7%). [\u2026]\n\n1.4 Methodology for calculation of green bonuses for individual categories of RES [\u2026]\n\nThe ERO has thus far used a nominal discount rate of 7% for setting purchasing prices.\"\n\n365.\n\nThe Technical Regulation and the ERO Methodology thus established that the ERO would set the FIT so as to allow producers to achieve a return on investment of 7% p.a. Applying these texts and taking into account that Act 180 set the duration of the payback period at 15 years, this meant that the level of the FIT to be set by the ERO was such that it would ensure (a) a 15 year simple payback of capital expenses and (b) a rate of return or profit of 7% per year for 15 years for those plants that could satisfy the ERO\u2019s technical and economic parameters.\n\n366.\n\nSubsection 6(1)(b)(2) then provides that \"the amount of revenue\" will remain unchanged for electricity from renewable sources \"with the support of the buy-out prices\" for a period of 15 years from the date when the solar plant is put into operation \"as a minimum\":\n\n\"2. after the date of the effect of this Act, the amount of the revenues stays unchanged for the unit of the electricity from the renewable sources with the support of the buy-out prices for the period of time of 15 years since the year, when the device was put into operation as minimum amount whilst taking the price index of the industrial producers into consideration; also the completion of the reconstruction of the technological part of the existing device, the change of the fuel or the completion of the modernisation, that increases the technical and ecological level of the existing device, are also regarded as putting the device into operation [\u2026]\"205\n\nExh. C-031, Claimants\u2019 Translation of Article 6 of Act 180, Section 6 (1)(b)(2).\n\n367.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, when subsection 6(1)(b) is read in its entirety, it is clear that the language \"amount of revenue stays unchanged\" in section 6(1)(b)(2) was not an absolute guarantee of revenues to solar PV plants. Subsection (b)(2) makes reference to the \"buy-out prices\" mentioned in subsection (b)(1), expressly stating that they are to \"support\" the \"revenues\" of solar PV plants. The buy-out prices themselves are set following the criteria contained in the Technical Regulation and the ERO Methodology, which state that the price will ensure a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment of at least 7% per year over 15 years. Thus, there is no abstract promise of \"revenues\" to investors. The revenues are tied to the buy-out prices, and the buy-out prices are, in turn, tied to the guarantees of a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment or profit of at least 7% per year over 15 years.\n\n368.\n\nThis conclusion derives from the text of Act 180 and its supporting framework. Indeed, the only mention of the term \"revenue\" in Act 180 is in section 6(1)(b)(2), where it is used in the context of the buy-out prices. Further, neither the Technical Regulation nor the ERO Methodology provide a basis for calculating \"the amount of revenues\" of solar PV plants, as something different from the buy-out prices. By contrast, they do provide instructions on the calculation of the buy-out prices, specifying that these prices are to be set at a level that guarantees a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment of at least 7% per year over 15 years.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, through section 6(1) of Act 180 and its implementing regulations, the Czech Republic promised that the buy-out price or FIT would be set at a level ensuring a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment or profit of at least 7% per year over 15 years for those solar PV plants that met the relevant parameters.\n\n370.\n\nThe Constitutional Court reached a similar conclusion,206 and its decision was cited with approval by the Supreme Administrative Court.207\n\nExh. R-084, Decision of the Constitutional Court, case no. Pl. \u00daS 17/11, 15 May 2012, \u00a768.\n\nExh. R-124, Decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, case No. 2 Afs 13/2013-28, 15 August 2013, pp. 6 et. seq.\n\n371.\n\nThe Commission also concluded that Act 180 did not guarantee a fixed FIT:\n\n\"Act No. 180/2005 Coll. did not guarantee a certain purchase price or green premium, but only a simple payback of the investment over a period of 15 years. The levy on photovoltaic producers has been calculated so as to ensure such simple payback, but no more.\"208\n\nExh. R-277, \u00a7135.\n\n372.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimants\u2019 and the Dissent\u2019s suggestion of a separate guarantee of an absolute FIT price level in the abstract, set independently of the guarantees of a 15 year payback of capital expenses and an annual return on investment of at least 7% over 15 years. As was discussed above, the \"revenues\" of solar PV plants are dependent on the \"buy-out\" prices, which must be fixed at a level that guarantees a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a 7% profit over 15 years. Thus, so long as these two guarantees continue to be maintained, investors obtain the level of revenue promised by the Czech Republic and there cannot be a breach of section 6(1) of Act 180.\n\n373.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the suggestion of the Claimants and the Dissent, these guarantees were sufficient to attract investment in solar RES production. [REDACTED], on whose advice the Claimants invested in the Czech Republic, found the guarantees of the Czech Republic \"sufficiently attractive\",209 namely sufficient to attract investors\u2019 interest.210 Similarly, while pursuing its own analysis, the Commission also deemed the rates of return guaranteed in Act 180 reasonable and in line with the renewable support schemes of other EU member States.211\n\n[REDACTED] WS I, \u00a712 (\"In conjunction with the solar radiation in the Czech Republic and the then existing investment costs per megawatt peak for PV plants, the guaranteed feed in tariffs resulted in a rate of return which was sufficiently attractive.\").\n\nTr. (Day 1) 230:19-20.\n\nCommission Decision, \u00a799.\n\n374.\n\nIt follows from this review that neither the legislation nor the implementing framework capped the returns of solar RES producers at 7%. If investors were able to invest and operate efficiently, their returns could well be over 7% per year. The Claimants\u2019 own returns were in excess of 7% per year, both before and after the contested measures.\n\n**b. Context of introduction of Solar Levy and withdrawal of income tax incentives**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nAs was stated earlier, the Respondent adopted Act 180 in March 2005 to support the production of electricity from all RES sources including windmills, biomass plants and solar energy.212 Solar electricity generation was not foreseen to contribute a significant part of RES generation: it was predicted that solar RES production would account for 15 GWh of electricity generation in 2010, as compared to 2,200 GWh from power plants using biomass.213 Further, the solar sector was generally expected to consist of \"small producers\" with a \"very low economic rate of return.\"214 This is not surprising, as the geographic location and climatic conditions of the Czech Republic make solar electricity generation there relatively inefficient.215 Finally, while prices were expected to rise because of the subsidies given to RES producers through Act 180, the Czech Republic expected this increase to be \"manageable\", in the range of 1% per year.216\n\nExh.

R-147, 2003 Bill and Explanatory Report (Respondent\u2019s translation), p.24.\n\n376.\n\nIn the years following the adoption of Act 180 until about September 2008, there was no significant increase in solar electricity generation.217 The vast majority of electricity from RES was generated by hydro and biomass power plants, with wind power growing in importance towards the end of that period.218\n\nExh. R-162, 2007 Report on the Achievement of the Indicative Target for Renewable Electricity Production, September 2008, \u00a77.\n\n[REDACTED] WS, \u00a710.\n\n377.\n\nAs was seen earlier, the parameters for calculating the FIT for solar RES producers were set out in the Technical Regulation219 and included the cost of solar panels, which was the largest capital expense associated with solar power projects.220 By late 2008, the cost of solar panels had decreased by approximately 40% from the levels in 2005.221 As a result, solar RES producers could set up generation facilities at a considerably lower cost, which is depicted in a study of the Czech Renewable Energy Agency:222\n\nExh. R-013, Technical Regulation.\n\nSolar panels take up to 74% of the capital outlays required to construct a solar generation facility. See Jones ER 1, \u00a75.15, relying on Annex 3, Solar panel price data from PVExchange.com.\n\nJones ER 1, Figure 7, Annex 3. The Claimants dispute this position, contending that the Respondent\u2019s submission is \"completely devoid of any substantiation\" and pointing out that the Respondent has not explained whether and to what extent investors benefited from the decrease in prices of solar panels (Reply, \u00a7\u00a771-72). The Tribunal does not find this to be the case.\n\nExh. R-178, Photovoltaic power plants - installed capacity in 2009, preliminary estimate, Czech RE Agency, September 2009, p.4.\n\n378.\n\nThe Agency observed that the reduction in the cost of solar panels could go down to 50% of the levels seen before 2008. It also noted that the fall in prices should lead to a decline of the FIT by 30% for large installations and 10% for small installations.\n\n379.\n\nPursuant to Section 6(3) of Act 180 and Section 4 of the Technical Regulation, the FIT was determined once a year - for plants to be commissioned in the year ahead - by reference to the producers\u2019 costs. As the principal capital expense for solar power projects was the price of the solar panels, the reduction in solar panel prices should have led to a lower FIT for the solar producers in the range identified by the Czech Renewable Energy Agency.\n\n380.\n\nHowever, the Czech Republic could not reduce FIT prices because of the 5% brake rule, which required that the FIT for any new plant put into operation would not be lower than 95% of the FIT payable to plants put into operation in the previous year. Accordingly, the ERO was unable to reduce the FIT by more than 5% for plants commissioned in 2009 and further no more than 5% for those commissioned in 2010. As a result, the FIT remained high, even though producers\u2019 costs had dropped by over 30% since 2008.\n\n381.\n\nThe resulting imbalance between the cost of setting up solar generation facilities and the profits generated from such facilities meant that solar RES producers who invested in the Czech Republic in 2009 and 2010 stood to benefit from a level of profitability that exceeded the rate of return that was originally contemplated by the Support Scheme. As a result, solar producers rushed in to set up solar plants in the Czech Republic, which is described as a \"solar boom\". The Claimants made their investment in this period.\n\n382.\n\nThe resulting solar energy production vastly exceeded original expectations; it was 40 times higher than envisioned when enacting Act 180.223 Instead of the expected 15 GWh production,224 the actual production in 2010 was 616 GWh and the actual production in 2011 was 2,182 GWh, more than three and a half times higher than the 2010 figure.225 Similarly, while in September 2008 installed capacity was predicted to be 10 MW by the end of 2010, the real figure turned out to be almost 200 times higher, at 1,960 MW.\n\nJones ER 1, \u00a76.16, Table 4.\n\nExh. R-162, \u00a77, The 2007 Report on the Achievement of the Indicative Target for Renewable Electricity Production, September 2008, estimated an annual production of 6GWh.\n\nJones ER 1, Table 4.\n\n383.\n\nThe \"solar boom\" had several deleterious effects, which were noted by Mr. [REDACTED], the then chairman of the ERO:\n\n\"First, a geometric growth in the highest-priced RES electricity generation would greatly increase the price of RES support paid by consumers, leading to unsustainably high electricity prices for households and businesses, which were already suffering from the effects of the financial crisis. Second, the situation would result in significant and unjustified profit increase of solar investors vis-a-vis other RES producers and other price-regulated entities. Third, a solar boom would threaten the stability of the grid, given the unpredictable and volatile nature of solar electricity production.\"226\n\n[REDACTED] WS, \u00a713.\n\n384.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Czech Republic took several measures to curb the solar boom. First, in or before July 2009, the national transmission system operator and the regional distribution system operators responsible for handling applications to connect new photovoltaic installations to the electricity grid started refusing applications.227 Later, in February 2010, they agreed to a moratorium on approving applications to connect new photovoltaic installations to the grid.228\n\nRej. \u00a794, relying on Exh. R-171, Letter from J. Firt to the Minister of Industry and Trade, V. Tosovsky, 1 July 2009.\n\n[REDACTED] WS, \u00a721.\n\n385.\n\nSecond, after more than a year of discussion, by amending Act 180 on 21 April 2010, the 5% brake rule was abolished. As a result, the ERO could reduce the FIT by more than 5% for plants connected in the following year i.e. in 2011. The reasons for doing so were stated in a press release of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of 24 August 2009:229\n\n\"The reason for the amendment of the act is primarily the situation in the area of photovoltaic devices, where the grant policy from the part of the state has ceased to fulfil its primary function\n\n[...]\n\nThe ongoing reduction in the prices of photovoltaic panels is leading to the uncontrolled development of solar power stations. Whereas technological advances have reduced the price of photovoltaic panels by more than 40%, by law the Energy Regulation Office can only reduce the purchase price of electricity for new renewable sources by 5% per year. So at present a significant advantage is being provided to newly built photovoltaic power stations compared to other sources of renewable energy.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n[I]f the current state were maintained the price for the delivery of electricity would rise by more than CZK 50/MWh for all customers in the Czech Republic just as a result of increase in photovoltaic devices. In 2011 the price for customers would be even higher.\n\nThe purchase prices for electricity from photovoltaic devices are guaranteed for 15 years, but thanks to new technology in certain cases the return on the investment is a mere 5 years. The level of the purchase price for electricity from a photovoltaic device is almost CZK 13/kWh, whereas the market price for electricity is around CZK 2/kWh.\"230\n\nThe press release stated the intent of the Ministry to abolish the 5% brake rule starting from 1 January 2010, but the limit was eventually abolished from 1 January 2011 by Act 137/2010.\n\nExh. R-175, Ministry of Industry and Trade will Equalize the Support of Renewable Energy Sources, Ministry of Industry and Trade Press Release (www.mpo.cz), 24 August 2009.\n\n386.\n\nThird, through its National Renewable Energy Action Plan of July 2010, the State indicated that hardly any additional solar generation capacity would be added during the entire decade from 2010 until 2020.231 It was said that the Plan \"would basically exterminate the development of solar energy.\"232\n\nExh. R-142, Czech National Renewable Energy Action Plan, July 2010, pp. 77-79 (projecting 1650 MW of installed solar capacity in 2010 and 1695 MW installed by 2020).\n\nExh. R-198, J. Vlkov\u00e1, \"Solar business will slow down, yet the price of electricity will soar,\" Mlada Fronta Dnes, 16 September 2010.\n\n387.\n\nFourth, in September 2010, the Government submitted a draft Act 330/2010 Coll. for Parliament\u2019s approval calling for a withdrawal of subsidies from all solar RES producers except the smallest rooftop solar installations that had an installed capacity of up to 30 kWh.233 The draft was approved by Parliament on 3 November 2010 and the Act came into effect from 1 January 2011; however, the provisions limiting the support only to the producers with that small capacity entered into force on 1 March 2011.\n\nExh. R-201, Explanatory Report to Draft Act No. 330/2010 Coll., 15 September 2010, p. 8. Act 330/2010 Coll. The Act did not affect installations put in operation before March 2011 and therefore is not one of the measures challenged in this dispute.\n\n388.\n\nYet, these measures failed to stem the tide of investment in solar RES. By contrast they led to a \"perverse dynamic\" - to use the Respondent\u2019s words - which saw an increase in the number of solar PV projects before 1 January 2011, when most of the measures just mentioned would come into effect.\n\n389.\n\nAs mentioned above, the FIT was funded through a compulsory surcharge set by the ERO in its yearly price decisions and invoiced to all electricity consumers by the grid operators as part of the electricity bill.234 The increased number of solar PV investments thus meant that Czech electricity consumers (including businesses and households) would face considerable increases in electricity prices. On its part, the Government would have to contribute to a portion of the FIT from its general budget at a time when the Czech Republic was not only struggling with the effects of the global financial crisis, but also suffering from a political crisis, which resulted in the appointment of a technocratic caretaker government from May 2009 to July 2010, as the early elections planned for 9 and 10 October 2009 had to be postponed to 29 and 30 May 2010, as a result of the Constitutional Court decision rendered on 10 September 2009.\n\nExh. R-037, ERO Price Decision No. 14/2005, 30 November 2005; Exh. R-038, ERO Price Decision No. 9/2006, 27 November 2006; Exh. R-039, ERO Price Decision No. 9/2007 26 November 2007; Exh.

R-033, ERO Price Decision No. 7/2009, 25 November 2009.\n\n390.\n\nThe problems caused by the rising costs to the State of supporting the solar PV plants as a consequence of the solar boom experienced in 2009 and 2010, were highlighted in an \"Explanatory Report to a proposed Act amending the Act on Promotion\" dated 13 October 2010:\n\n\"According to the analyses of ERO made in cooperation with distribution system operators in September [...] there would be increase in the electricity prices by 12.7 % for households and by 18.4 % for industrial consumers as a result of the annual increase in the amount of the contribution from the present CZK 166 per MWh to CZK 547 per MWh.\n\nIt is clear from the analysis of the impact of the contribution in the amount of CZK 500 per MWh, which was prepared by the Coordination Committee established by the Government on 22 September 2010, that this level of contribution becomes liquidating for the Czech industry. If this amount of contribution is actually included [in] the price of electricity, there will be:\n\n- A massive drop in tax revenues of the State, because due to the increased costs for electricity numerous businesses will end up in loss instead of having a planned profit;\n\n- Immediate layoffs in major industrial enterprises amounting to tens of thousands of employees who will be subsequently entitled to unemployment benefits, housing assistance, etc. (the chemical industry estimates up to 10 000 employees);\n\n- Termination of business activities of some large industrial enterprises in the Czech Republic and transfer of production to other countries.\"235\n\nExh. R-028, Explanatory Report to a proposed Act amending the Act on Promotion, 13 October 2010, pp. 2-3.\n\n391.\n\nIt was therefore thought necessary to take additional financial measures to limit the rise of electricity prices and alleviate the burden on the Czech economy. Discussions on these issues had commenced in November 2009.236 In fact, already on 23 September 2010, the Minister of Finance mentioned the three measures at issue in this arbitration, i.e. the Solar Levy, the withdrawal of the tax exemption and the change to the depreciation period:\n\n\"[t]he budget is the priority for the minister and new losses will be filled by the novelty called solar tax.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nMy proposal cancels the 5-year tax exemption. This applies to all facilities, not only those that are yet to be connected. The last year when this tax exemption can be applied is 2010. In addition, I am moving the technology which is now in the second or third depreciation group [to] the fourth depreciation group. This means that things that used to depreciated over 5 to 10 years, will be depreciated over 20 years.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn some places we tightened the screws, in others we released them and the result [on the budget] is zero.\"237\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. R-202, \"Additional payments for solar energy reached three billion; the state may curtail their boom\" (Novinky.cz), 2 November 2009.\n\nExh. R-206, P. Vasek, \"We made concessions but it will not put the budget at risk,\" Hospod\u00e1rsk\u00e9 Noviny, 24 September 2010.\n\n392.\n\nIt was in these particular circumstances that the Czech Government withdrew the Tax Incentives (i) and introduced the Solar Levy (ii).\n\n(i) Withdrawal of the Tax Incentives\n------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nOn 8 December 2010, through Act 346/2010, the Czech Republic adopted changes to the Income Tax Act, abolishing the five-year income tax exemption and amending the tax depreciation period for solar panels.\n\n394.\n\nThe reasons for withdrawing the tax exemption were mentioned in the Explanatory Report accompanying Act 346/2010:\n\n\"The proposed changes are in response to the need to eliminate all legal means for the indirect support of electric power generation from renewable resources (mainly solar power plants) that is no longer justified, and therefore they are making taxation on environmentally friendly power generation sources and facilities stricter and eliminating the tax-exempt status of income from the operation of environmentally friendly power generation facilities. In order to simplify legal regulation and enable easier administration, the elimination of this exempt status for other environmentally friendly facilities has also been proposed.\"238\n\nExh. R-221, Explanatory Report to Draft Act No. 346/2010 Coll., 26 October 2010, pp. 27-28.\n\n395.\n\nSimilarly, the rationale for amending the depreciation provisions were stated as follows:\n\n\"Since more than three quarters of costs need to be spent for the technological part of solar power facilities and only one quarter needs to be spent for the construction part of solar power facilities, and the construction part is usually included in depreciation group 4 with a depreciation period of 20 years (and in the case of construction projects for a definite period even 30 years), the specified changes have been proposed only for the technological part of the assets. For the purpose of easier application of the proposal, the technological part, which consists particularly of solar panels, converters and switches, is defined by its inclusion in the Standard Production Classification groups with code 31.10, 31.20 or 32.10. The change has been proposed in view of the fact that in the case of solar technology there has been a sharp decrease in acquisition prices, particularly for solar panels, and an increase in their efficiency.\"239\n\nId., p.28.\n\n396.\n\nBoth the withdrawal of the tax exemption and the amendment to the depreciation provision of the Income Tax Act were measures that had been taken before by the Czech Republic in different contexts.240\n\nSee Rej., \u00a7164, and the examples cited therein.\n\n(ii) Introduction of the Solar Levy\n-----------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nOn 14 December 2010, through Act 402/2010, the Czech Republic introduced the Solar Levy. When doing so, it was careful not to alter the framework of Act 180.\n\n398.\n\nFirst, only those producers who benefited the most from the solar boom, i.e. solar plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010 were subject to the Solar Levy. Initially, the Solar Levy only applied for three years from 1 January 2011 for the PV plants put into operation between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010.\n\n399.\n\nSecond, when setting the Solar Levy, care was taken to ensure that the initial payback period of 15 years for capital expenses and the reasonable profit of 7% promised through Act 180 would be retained. As Mr. [REDACTED] explained:\n\n\"Before settling on a Solar Levy, the Ministry of Industry and Trade requested ERO to assess whether simple payback and return on investment parameters would still be met. We assessed the proposed levy and determined that investors would still receive simple payback of their investment in less than 15 years and that return over the life of the investment would remain appropriate, i.e. above the 7% WACC. We therefore considered that the levy was properly calibrated to reduce the excessive profit provided by the Subsidies.\"241\n\n[REDACTED] WS, \u00a725.\n\n400.\n\nEventually, the Solar Levy was set at 26% initially for a period of three years to ensure that these elements of Act 180 were maintained. The Government resolution accompanying Act 402 explained this as follows:\n\n\"The ERO in the determination of the purchase prices mainly acts according to Act No. 180/2005 Sb. on support of electricity production from RES, as well as related implementing regulations. One of the significant documents is Decree of ERO No. 475/2005 Coll., as amended, which among other things stipulates the technical and economic parameters applied to the calculation of the prices for a given type of plant for production of electricity from RES and the concerned calendar year. Typically this concerns measurable investment costs, assumed period of usage and lifecycle of the given type of source.\n\nThe ERO last time amended this Decree in mid-2009 under Decree No. 409/2009 Coll.), in which it responded to the decline in the prices of solar technology and on the basis of evaluation of concrete projects from the first half of 2009, it set reference investment costs for installed sources with an output above 30 kWp in the amount of 90 thousand CZK/kWp, respectively 90 million CZK/MWp.\n\nIf we use this binding legislative condition to calculate the purchase price and if we set the next ROI parameter at 11 years at 7% discount, we get a purchase price of CZK 9000/MWh. This value is 26 % lower than the purchase price set for 2010 in the amount of CZK 12150/MWh (due to the limitation of decline to only 5 %). While the ROI guaranteed by law is 15 years.\n\nThe simple ROI of 11 years for calculation of the size of the withholding tax was chosen in view of the fact that the same period was chosen in the amendment bill to Act No. 180/2005 Coll. (No. 137/20101 Coll.) as the threshold value, which if exceeded makes it possible to choose an extraordinary (steeper) drop of the price, than the standard maximum of 5%\".242\n\nExh. R-216, Draft Government resolution on the problem of electricity price increases due to RES support presented by Ministry of Finance for Government session of 20 October 2010, p. 4.\n\n401.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Czech Constitutional Court observed that despite the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives and the introduction of the Solar Levy, a PV plant meeting the ERO\u2019s technical parameters would achieve a simple payback of capital expenses within 15 years and a 7% adequate return.243\n\nExh. R-084, \u00a768.\n\n402.\n\nThis conclusion was confirmed by the Respondent\u2019s expert Mr. Peer. He replicated the model used by the ERO in setting the FIT and assessed whether, following the adoption of the contested measures (including the Solar Levy), a model PV plant with the technical parameters specified by the ERO would achieve (i) simple payback of capital expenses within 15 years; and (ii) the 7% adequate return. According to his analysis, a plant commissioned in 2010 and meeting the ERO\u2019s technical parameters would achieve a simple payback in [REDACTED] years and would obtain a rate of return of [REDACTED] % per year over its 20-year useful life.244 His analysis was not refuted. Thus, even after the introduction of the Solar Levy, the rate of return and the payback period mentioned in Act 180 and its implementing regulations remained for those solar PV plants that met the ERO\u2019s technical parameters.\n\nPeer ER 1, Table 3; Peer ER 2, Table 1 (showing the simple payback period and rates of return for the Claimants\u2019 plants as well as the ERO reference plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010).\n\n403.\n\nThird, as mentioned above, the Czech Republic also provided an opportunity for individual solar producers to seek relief if the Solar Levy affected them adversely. Indeed, the Ministry of Finance established a procedure under which solar RES producers on whom the Solar Levy had a \"strangling effect\" could pay the Solar Levy over a longer period of time.245\n\nExh. R-225, Decision of the Grand Chamber of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, case No. 1 Afs 76/2013-57, 17 December 2013.\n\n404.\n\nThe withdrawal of the Tax Incentives and the introduction of the Solar Levy did produce the intended effects. Indeed, while the ERO first set the surcharge for electricity support at CZK 578 per MWh,246 after Act 402 was published, it reduced the surcharge by 36% to 370 CZK per MWh, limiting electricity price growth to around 5%247 and bringing it in line with the expectations of the Government when Act 180 was enacted.\n\nExh. R-035, ERO Price Decision No. 04/2010, 30 November 2010, Art. 5.1.\n\nExh. R-220, \"Energy Regulatory Office amended its November decision as expected,\" ERO Press Release, 29 December 2010.\n\n405.\n\nAs mentioned above, Act 180 was repealed and replaced by Act 165/2012 as of 1 January 2013. Act 165 did not address the Solar Levy. Act 310/2013, however, which amended Act 165/2012, extended the Solar Levy for solar plants commissioned in 2010 at a rate of 10%, for the whole period during which the solar PV plant was entitled to the support. The possible extension of the Solar Levy had been contemplated when it was introduced.248 In any event, despite the extension of the Solar Levy, it was anticipated that a plant operating in accordance with the parameters set by the ERO would achieve a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return of 7% as guaranteed in the framework of Act 180.249\n\nExh. R-108, R. Sitner and Z. Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1, \"The state will tax the solar power plant operators only for three years,\" Hospod\u00e1rsk\u00e9 Noviny, 3 November 2010.\n\nPeer ER 2, \u00a72.2.2 and Table 3.\n\n406.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal concludes that under the framework established through Act 180, the Czech Republic guaranteed solar RES producers meeting specific technical and economic parameters a level of revenue through a FIT system ensuring a 15 year payback of capital expenses and an annual return on investment of at least 7% for 15 years. The contested measures were reasonable, being a carefully calibrated response to developments in the Czech solar sector at a time of economic and political uncertainty.250 The foregoing analysis shows that the measures left the guarantees of payback and return intact for plants meeting the required parameters.\n\nThis was also the conclusion of the Czech Constitutional Court (Exh. R-084). The Commission observed that the Levy was introduced by the Czech Republic to ensure that solar RES producers were not overcompensated (Exh. 277, Commission Decision, \u00a751).\n\n**c. Legitimate expectations**\n------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nIt is common ground that the FET obligation is breached when the legitimate expectations of an investor are not met. These expectations must arise from representations made by the state, on which the investor relied at the time of its investment. They must be objectively reasonable251 and must take into account all relevant circumstances:\n\n\"To be protected, the investor\u2019s expectations must be legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest\".252\n\n*Charanne B.V. and Construction Investments S.A.R.L. v. Kingdom of Spain,* SCC Case No 062/2012, Final Award, 21 January 2016, (\"*Charanne*\"), Exh. RLA-165, \u00a7495.\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, \u00a7340.\n\n408.\n\nIt is also common ground that an investor can have no legitimate expectation that the host State\u2019s laws will not change.253 Indeed, as observed by the tribunal in *Micula* :\n\n\"The state has a right to regulate, and investors must expect that the legislation will change, absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurance giving rise to a legitimate expectation\".254\n\nTr. (Day 1) 25:11-15 (\"[I]t is not our contention that an investor can legitimately expect that the laws at the time of investment will not be changed. That would be foolish to expect. Even investment treaties do not cause a freezing of the law.\").\n\n*Micula et al. v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013 (\"Micula\"),* \u00a7666 *.*\n\n409.\n\nTo ascertain whether the state has granted a stabilization commitment or given a specific assurance, the form, the content and the clarity of the alleged promise are of critical relevance.255 As observed in *Total v. Argentina* :\n\n\"the form and specific content of the undertaking of stability invoked are crucial. No less relevant is the clarity with which the authorities have expressed their intention to bind themselves for the future\".256\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, \u00a7121. See also *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00a7547 (stating that the state\u2019s promise or representation must be \"precise as to its content and clear as to its form\").\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, \u00a7121.\n\n410.\n\nIn line with this jurisprudence, the Claimants admit that \"any general legal provision\" cannot give rise to legitimate expectations,257 and that \"commitments must [\u2026] be specific to have such effect\".258\n\nReply, \u00a7227.\n\nReply, \u00a7227.\n\n411.\n\nAccordingly, all relevant circumstances must be taken into account to determine whether an investor\u2019s expectations of stability are legitimate, including the form and content of the promise of stability. The investor\u2019s expectations are to be examined objectively, and the investor must have relied on the state\u2019s promises of stability at the time of making its investment.\n\n(i) Solar Levy\n--------------\n\n412.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the plain language of Article 6(1)(b)(2) of Act 180 relating to revenues per unit of electricity amounts to a stabilization guarantee.259 For them, Act 180 contains \"a statutory promise that plants connected to the grid would receive a fixed tariff for 20 years\"260 and \"investors could expect that the Support Scheme gave price guarantees on specific revenues for 20 years.\"261 On the basis of the Respondent\u2019s commitment in Act 180, the Claimants, so they say, legitimately expected the FIT to be stable for the first 20 years of operation. However, the Respondent introduced the Solar Levy, which, in effect, reduced the FIT by the amount of the Levy, thereby breaching the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.\n\nReply, \u00a7175, (\"Act 180/2005 provided [\u2026] an express stabilisation: the tariffs applicable at the time of connecting a solar plant to the grid would remain unchanged for 15[20] years. It is an express promise by the State that a certain status of the law would not be changed, i.e. remain stabilized.\").\n\nReply, \u00a793.\n\nReply, \u00a742.\n\n413.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants\u2019 position. The Tribunal has extensively reviewed Section 6(1) of Act 180 above [\u00a7\u00a7358 et. seq.] and concluded that it contains no separate guarantee of an absolute level of revenue, set independently of the FIT system that guarantees a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment of at least 7% per year over 15 (later 20) years. Indeed, section 6(1)(b)(2), particularly the words \"amount of the revenues stays unchanged\", cannot be read in isolation. The provision must be read in context with the rest of section 6(1). As explained above [\u00a7\u00a7358 et. seq.], section 6(1) of Act 180 guarantees, through a FIT system, solar PV plants put into operation after Act 180 (such as the Claimants\u2019 plants), a level of revenue ensuring a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a profit of 7% per year over a period of 15 (later 20) years, provided these plants meet specific parameters. Interpreting this provision in any other fashion would do violence to the text of the provision, and to the broader context of section 6(1).262\n\nThe 5% brake rule does not alter the guarantees contained in Act 180 and its supporting framework. Indeed, even if any expectations was created by this provision, it remains that through Act 180 and its supporting framework, the Czech Republic only promised a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment of at least 7% per year over a period of 15 (later 20) years.\n\n414.\n\nThe Claimants should have been aware that the Support Scheme only guaranteed a 15 year payback of capital expenses and at least a 7% return for 15 years.263 This is because both Act 180 and the Technical Regulation were referred to in the legal opinion of Ueltzhoffer Balada.264 Further, Mr. [REDACTED] \u2019s presentation of June 2009 also mentioned the Technical Regulation.265\n\nSoC \u00a764 (\"The presentation by Mr. [REDACTED] [\u2026] made also explicit reference to the Public Notices 475/2005 and 150 of the ERO specifying the implementation of the Support Scheme. In other words, the full Support Scheme was discussed and deliberated, allowing Stefan and J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen to get the full picture of the legal framework in force at that time.\").\n\nExh. C-054, Legal opinion concerning the duration of power feed-in remuneration when erecting photovoltaic systems in the Czech Republic by Ueltzhoffer Balada, 2009, p.2.\n\nExh.C-53, p.9.\n\n415.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Claimants continue to receive a FIT that ensures a 15 year payback of capital expenses and at least a 7% return on investment per year. In his First Report, Mr. Peer estimated the Claimants\u2019 payback period and rate of return on the basis of the 7% WACC provided by the ERO, as well as the lower WACC used by the Claimants\u2019 expert Mr. [REDACTED]. He concluded that even after the contested measures, the Claimants\u2019 revenue remained at a level that would allow a payback within less than 15 years and a rate of return exceeding 7%.266 In his Second Report, Mr. Peer calculated the payback period and the rate of return on the basis of the Claimants\u2019 own inputs for OPEX growth, tax rates and PV panel degradation rates in lieu of utilizing the regulatory rates assumed by the ERO for these parameters, as he had done in his First Report. Like in his First Report, he again found that the Claimants\u2019 plants achieved a level of revenue that would allow a payback of capital expenses in less than 15 years and a profit above 7%.267 The Claimants did not seek to rebut these findings; they gave no instructions to opine on them to their expert Mr. [REDACTED].268 Neither did they question them during Mr. Peer\u2019s cross-examination. In fact, Mr. [REDACTED] himself did confirm that the Claimants were satisfied with their investment:\n\n\"Q. Now, you're a very seasoned businessman, I think, and you must have an idea whether this was a good investment or was it not. Can you share with us what your present impression is?\n\n\"A. Well, basically, I would say that, up till now, we are satisfied with the investment but looking at the technical part of the plants, now, in the first years we had not a lot of repairs to do\".269\n\nPeer ER 1, \u00a7\u00a74.4.2-4.4.3.\n\nPeer ER 2, \u00a7\u00a73.3.6, 3.3.8.\n\nTr. (Day 3) 531:25-532:1-5 (\"I have not been instructed to review Mr. Peer\u2019s calculations of payback periods or implied rate of returns. I have read the Report but I have not done anything to scrutinize the results or even reviewed the inputs going into that calculation. So I, from the bottom of my heart, I just don't know.\").\n\nTr. (Day 1) 192:11-18.\n\n416.\n\nOn the basis of this analysis, the Tribunal concludes that, even after the contested measures, the Claimants\u2019 revenue remains within the parameters set by Act 180 and its supporting framework, i.e. the Claimants continue to receive a level of revenue through the FIT system that ensures a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a return on investment of at least 7% per year over a period of 15 (later 20) years. In the circumstances, as the guarantees given by the Czech Republic continue to be complied with in respect of the Claimants, there can be no breach of the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.\n\n417.\n\nThe Claimants have specifically referred to the Support Scheme as the basis of their alleged expectations.270 The Tribunal has held that the Support Scheme could not legitimately have given rise to such expectations. It has also held that the expectations that the Support Scheme could have legitimately created continue to be met. Thus, the Tribunal could dispense with reviewing the other alleged representations on which the Claimants rely as a source of their expectations, especially in circumstances where the latter consider this exercise unnecessary and view these other representations as merely confirming their expectations arising out of the Support Scheme.271 For the sake of completeness however, the Tribunal nevertheless proceeds to examine these representations.\n\nSoC, \u00a7205, cited in Reply, \u00a7238 (\"Claimants specifically referred to this Suport [sic] Scheme as the basis of their legitimate expectations.\").\n\nReply, \u00a7238 (\"Even though, in view of the unambiguous language of the Support Scheme itself, there was no further need to show that these provisions were objectively to be understood to contain a guarantee to remain unchanged, Claimants also pointed to a series of public statements by senior government members, explanatory notes to the relevant laws and official communications which affirmed the existence of these guarantees.\").\n\n418.\n\nBesides the text of Act 180, the Claimants submit that the \"intention of the legislator\" confirms that solar RES producers were to be guaranteed a fixed FIT, for which they rely on an \"Explanatory Report to Act 180\".272 The Tribunal sees no merit in this submission. First, there is no \"Explanatory Report to Act 180\". The 2003 Explanatory Report which the Claimants invoke was submitted to the Czech Parliament along with the initial bill which evolved into Act 180 16 months later. In any event, while the wording and in part the content273 is different, section 8(1)(b)(1) of the bill referred to a \"guarantee\" of return of investment costs within 15 years and \"reasonable profit.\"274\n\nSee, for instance, Claimants\u2019 Closing Presentation, p.14 citing Exh. C-041, Explanatory Report (\"These conditions were designed in the way so that the provided support created a favorable climate for investors with a sufficiently long and effective guarantees (15 years) [\u2026].\").\n\nSee, for instance, Rej., \u00a758 where the Respondent points out that the bill contemplates a system of tradeable green certificates, which the Explanatory Act considers as one of the \"bases\" of the \"Promotion System.\" Act 180 however introduces a system of green bonuses instead of tradeable certificates.\n\nExh. C-041, Explanatory Note of November 12, 2003 to Act 180/2005.\n\n419.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the following language in the 2003 Explanatory Report :\n\n\"[The] Promotion system is based on: [...] Provision of guarantees to investors and owners of facilities producing electricity from renewable sources which are beneficiaries of the promotion pursuant to the bill that the profit for one unit of energy produced from renewable sources, for the benefit of producers, shall be guaranteed for 15 years since the putting into operation (or 15 years for facilities which were put into operation before the act comes into effect, respectively).\"275\n\nExh. C-041, Explanatory Note of November 12, 2003 to Act 180/2005, p. 7.\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal fails to discern in that report and the bill a commitment that goes beyond the guarantee of a FIT at a level permitting a 15 year return of capital expenses and a \"reasonable profit\" which later became the \"adequate return\" measured at a WACC of 7%. As was just seen above, the Claimants continue to benefit from these guarantees despite the Solar Levy.\n\n421.\n\nThis being so, even if one were to accept that the 2003 Explanatory Report had a different content, *quod non*, the Claimants have not alleged that they had reviewed, let alone relied on the report when making the investment. At the same time, they themselves recognize that an investor must rely on the alleged representations at the time it makes its investment.276 The requirement that an investor must have relied on a representation was well-explained in *Invesmart v. Czech Republic* :\n\n\"there is a temporal dimension to evaluating a claimed expectation [\u2026]\n\n[I]t is not appropriate to base a claimed expectation upon the content of [documents/discussions] to which the investor was not privy at the time. [\u2026] [I]f [an investor] was not privy to [documents/discussions] nor informed of its results, the investor cannot use [them] as proof of its expectation at the time. Such documents can confirm a claimed expectation, but they cannot be used to establish a particular factual element of a claimed expectation if such element was unknown to the investor at the time\".277\n\nSoC, \u00a7194 (\"It should be common ground between the parties that [the FET] standard is breached if [t]he investor relied on certain expectations when making the investment.\"). See also for e.g. Reply, \u00a7225 where the Claimants rely (for the second time) on *CME v. Czech Republic*, \u00a7611: \"[legitimate expectations are violated] by evisceration of the arrangements in reliance upon which the foreign investor was induced to invest.\"\n\n*Invesmart B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 June 2009 (\"*Invesmart*\"), \u00a7\u00a7252-253.\n\n422.\n\nThe Claimants also invoke other documents, which - according to them - show that the Czech Republic made \"specific representations\" guaranteeing a fixed FIT.278 Here again, the Claimants\u2019 arguments fail to convince. Most of these \"representations\" state that Act 180 guarantees a FIT for a period of 15 (later 20) years.279 This says nothing more than what the Tribunal understands the regulatory framework to guarantee. It does not refer to a promise exceeding a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a 7% rate of return. The statements invoked by the Claimants contain no details of the level of the FIT that is guaranteed; that information is found in Act 180 and the supporting framework, which was publicly available and which any potential investor would refer to when deciding whether to invest in the Czech Republic. While some representations admittedly do ambiguously mention \"preservation of the level of feed-in tariffs for 15 years for plants already in operation\",280 this language cannot change the text of Act 180 and its supporting framework.\n\nFor instance, the 2006 Report on Meeting the Indicative Target for the Production of Electricity from Renewable Sources (Exh. C-100), which mentioned that a \"key feature\" of the Support Scheme was \"the preservation of the level of feed-in tariffs for 15 years for plants already in operation\". See also Exh. C-035, Statement of Mr. Urban, the Minister of Industry and Trade, during the parliamentary deliberations of the Support Scheme on 31 March 2005 (\"In the field of the support of electricity from renewable energy sources, the bill brings especially the long-term guarantee of feed-in tariffs and therefore it secures a stable business environment, which the potential investors call for intensively.\").\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. CE-035 (Statement of Milan Urban, Minister of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic, during the Parliamentary deliberations of the support scheme in the Chamber of Deputies on 31 March 2005), p. 1: \"In the field of the support of electricity from renewable energy sources, the bill brings especially the long-term guarantee of feed-in tariffs and therefore it secures a stable business environment, which the potential investors call for intensively.\"; Exh. CE-099 (2004 Report on the Achievement of the Indicative Target for Renewable Electricity), p. 3: \"[Act 180] guarantees a level of return on each unit of electricity produced for a period of 15 years.\"; Exh. CE-044 (Information from the Czech Renewable Energy Agency about the support system of the Act on Support), p. 2: \"The amount of the feed-in tariffs is guaranteed for period of 15 years [\u2026]. In contrast to green bonuses, the fifteen-year guarantee of amount of revenues for electricity unit since the year of putting the facility for production of electricity from renewable energy sources into operation must not be influenced.\"; Exh. CE-046 (Presentation given by the ERO in Prague on 26 January 2006), p. 2: \"keeping of support for 15 years in due consideration of price index of industry producers (regarding feed-in tariffs).\"; Exh. CE-048 (Presentation given by the Czech Energy Agency), p. 1: \"guarantee for tariffs for 15 years (tariff assessments of ER[O]).\"; Exh. CE-040 (Excerpt from the FAQ section on the Energy Regulatory Office\u2019s homepage dated 15 November 2009), p. 1: \"feed-in-tariffs and green bonus for the photovoltaic systems commissioned after 1 January 2008 may be claimed for 20 years.\"\n\nExh. CE-100, 2006 Report on Meeting the Indicative Target for the Production of Electricity from Renewable Sources, p.19.\n\n423.\n\nFurther, the Claimants again have not alleged that they reviewed and relied on these documents before making their investments in the Czech Republic. As a result, assuming that the content of these statements contained promises beyond those accepted by the Tribunal, *quod non*, the Claimants could have derived no legitimate expectations from these sources. In fact, the Claimants admit, that *ex post* interpretations of the Support Scheme cannot be used to test the Claimants\u2019 *ex ante* legitimate expectations.281\n\nReply, \u00a744.\n\n424.\n\nFinally, the Claimants rely on what they call \"acts of state\" as a source of their expectations. They submit that they received guarantees through the licences, price decisions made by the ERO, and individual contracts. However, these instruments provide no representation of the sort claimed by the Claimants.\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that Act 180 did not guarantee fixed revenues as alleged by the Claimants. Hence, the Claimants had no legitimate expectations and there can be no issue of breach of any such expectations.\n\n426.\n\nHaving thus examined - and rejected - the Claimants\u2019 arguments concerning the breach of their legitimate expectations in respect of the Solar Levy, the Tribunal proceeds to examine the Claimants\u2019 submissions in respect of the Tax Incentives.\n\n(ii) Tax Incentives\n-------------------\n\n427.\n\nThe second set of measures challenged by the Claimants concern the discontinuation of the Tax Incentives granted by the Czech Republic. As in the case of the Solar Levy, the Claimants submit that the Czech Republic had made a commitment that the Tax Incentives, i.e. the preferential depreciation period and the tax exemption, would remain unchanged for the life of the PV plants:282 \"[the Tax Incentives] amount to a prospective guarantee promising an investor a certain tax treatment for a certain number of years\".283\n\nThe Tribunal understands the Claimants\u2019 submission to address both the tax exemption and the preferential tax depreciation period.\n\nRej., \u00a7407.\n\n428.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Tax Incentives existed before the Support Scheme came into force. In respect of the preferential depreciation period, the Claimants assert that \"the tax depreciation provisions [that apply] prospectively for a certain period into the future [\u2026] amount to very clear stabilization assurances.\"284 The Respondent opposes this position and points out that because solar panels did not fall under any of the defined asset classes under the original provisions of the Income Tax Act, they fell under a residual category of \"other tangible assets\" for which the Act simply lists the depreciation period.285\n\nReply, \u00a7303.\n\nExh. R-006, Act 586/1992 Coll. on Income Tax, \u00a730 and Annex 1 (original depreciation provisions).\n\n429.\n\nThe Claimants have not relied on any statutory language promising that solar panels would be depreciated over a particular period of time and there is indeed no mention that the provisions would not be changed. In fact, the depreciation provisions of the Act have frequently been amended and the Claimants initially appeared uncertain about the precise regime applicable to solar panels.286 In the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept that the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the depreciation periods would not be altered.\n\nSoC, fn. 39 (\"the distinction between parts falling under the 5 year or 10 year depreciation period is not always entirely clear\").\n\n430.\n\nIn respect of the tax exemption, the Claimants rely on Section 19(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Section 19. Tax Exemptions (1) Exempted from Tax shall be [\u2026]\n\n(d) revenues from [\u2026] solar facilities [\u2026] in the calendar year in which they were put into operation for the first time and the five years immediately following.287\n\nSoC, fn. 104 (citing Act 586/1992 Coll. On Income Tax, \u00a719(d) (original tax exemption provision)).\n\n431.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the \"Explanatory Report to Act 180\" \"unequivocally confirmed and indeed preserved the already existing tax exemptions\"288, as a result of which the tax exemption \"became an integral part of the Support Scheme\".289\n\nReply, \u00a763.\n\nReply, \u00a764.\n\n432.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above [\u00a7\u00a7418 et. seq,], the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to rely on the so-called Explanatory Report of Act 180. In any event, even if it were to do so, the Tribunal would find nothing in that report resembling a stabilization guarantee. Indeed, the 2003 Explanatory Report merely states that:\n\n\"[The] Promotion System is based on: [\u2026] [the] Preservation of tax allowances in the extent determined in the Income Tax Act, Real Estate Tax Act, Value Added Tax Act, [\u2026]\"290\n\nExh. C-041, Explanatory Note of November 12, 2003 to Act 180/2005.\n\n433.\n\nThe Explanatory Report contains no representation that the tax exemption would continue to apply throughout the lifetime of the solar PV plants. The Claimants have not cited any rule of Czech law excluding or limiting the legislators\u2019 powers to amend a tax exemption. In reality, the Czech tax legislation has frequently been amended, including, as Claimants admit, through no less than five withdrawals of tax exemptions.291\n\nReply, \u00a769.\n\n434.\n\nAs a source of their expectations that the tax exemption would continue, the Claimants also refer to a presentation which the ERO made in October 2006 which had a mention \"'tax holiday' - 1 + 5 years\".292 For the same reasons as those mentioned above, the Tribunal cannot see a stabilization guarantee in these words. The presentation simply notes the existence of a \"tax 'holiday'\" without more. This note cannot be read as a promise on the part of the Czech legislators not to change the country\u2019s tax laws in the future.\n\nSoC, \u00a749, citing Exh. C-048, \"Support of renewable energy sources and energy saving\", ERO Presentation, slide 1. The Claimants also refer to another ERO presentation of 26 January 2006 (Exh. C-047), but that presentation does not mention of the Income Tax Act.\n\n435.\n\nThe Czech Constitutional Court too rejected the challenge on the tax exemptions for the same reasons that it upheld the imposition of the Solar Levy.293\n\nExh. R-084, \u00a784.\n\n436.\n\nIn any event, as was already noted earlier, legitimate expectations can only arise if the investor relies on the representations made by the State at the time of its investment. Here, the Claimants have not shown that they relied on the 2003 Explanatory Report or the ERO presentation when they made this investment.\n\n437.\n\nIn the absence of a commitment by the Respondent that the Tax Incentives would not be altered, the Claimants should expect that the laws in force at the time of its investment would change. The expectations which the Claimants might have had cannot be deemed legitimate and, therefore, cannot benefit from the protection of the Treaty. As the Claimants recognize: \"an investor can[not] legitimately expect that the laws at the time of investment will not be changed.\"294\n\nTr. (Day 1) 25:12-14.\n\n**d. Deliberate harm**\n----------------------\n\n438.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 allege that the Respondent \"deliberately caused harm to Claimants\" in violation of the Treaty\u2019s FET standard.295 They insist that the Czech Republic attracted investors in the solar PV sector on the basis of the guarantees provided in Act 180 in order to meet the EU\u2019s targets and, once those targets were met, the Republic revoked those guarantees, a conduct that is neither fair nor equitable. The situation was \"self-inflicted\" and the Respondent \"can hardly plead ignorance\".296 These claims were not specifically addressed at the hearing.\n\nReply, \u00a7269.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Comments on the New Evidence, \u00a732.\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimants. While it is, of course, true that the FET standard may be breached if a state\u2019s conduct is not \"substantively proper\" - to use the words of the *Micula* tribunal - the Tribunal sees no impropriety here.297 The circumstances of this case are not those contemplated by the tribunal in *Waste Management v. Mexico,* when it observed that a \"deliberate act\" by a state to \"set out to destroy or frustrate\" an investment by \"improper means\" could constitute a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the North American Free Trade Agreement.298 Neither are the circumstances here comparable with those in *Vivendi II*, where the Tribunal concluded that the respondent \"improperly and without justification\" pursued an \"illegitimate campaign\" against the investment. The circumstances here are quite different.299\n\n*Micula,* \u00a7529 (\"In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the correct position is that the state may always change its legislation, being aware and thus taking into consideration that: (i) an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations must be protected; (ii) the state\u2019s conduct must be substantively proper (e.g., not arbitrary or discriminatory); and (iii) the state\u2019s conduct must be procedurally proper (e.g., in compliance with due process and fair administration\").\n\nSoC, \u00a7188 relying on *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, \u00a7138.\n\nSoC, \u00a7189 relying on *Compania de Aguas de Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00a7\u00a77.4.19 and 7.4.39.\n\n440.\n\nFirst, there is no evidence that Act 180 was designed to promote \"foreign\" investment, or that the Respondent attracted the Claimants\u2019 investment in particular. In reality, the Czech legislature did not anticipate that the Act would prompt significant growth in solar PV plants among a much larger group of electricity producers from other RES. It is thus not correct to say that the Czech Republic \"deliberately\" offered a high FIT to attract solar PV investors like the Claimants. Neither is it correct to say that solar PV investors were \"specifically targeted\" so that the Czech Republic could meet the targets required by the 2001 EU Directive. Indeed, this Directive is not strictly binding, as Mr. [REDACTED], the Claimants\u2019 expert admitted.300 The Czech Republic was thus under no obligation to increase its solar PV capacity in 2005 when Act 180 was introduced. Further, the National Renewable Energy Action Plan of July 2010 made clear that the targets set under the 2009 EU Directive would not be met by increased investments in solar PV plants.\n\n[REDACTED] ER 1, \u00a717 (\"Mr. Jones makes a point in his report that the First EU Directive targets were not legally binding. While this is true, based on the regulatory developments put in place, there is no doubt that the Government was committed to reaching this target, be it a legally binding one or not.\").\n\n441.\n\nSecond, the Claimants have not made a case that they were discriminated against.301 The withdrawal of the Tax Incentives and the imposition of the Solar Levy equally affected all domestic and foreign producers that had commissioned solar PV plants in 2009 and 2010. They did not single out the Claimants.\n\nSee, for e.g. SoC, \u00a7165, where the Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 7(2) (umbrella clause), 2(2) (fair and equitable treatment) and 4(1) (full protection and security) of the Treaty. See also Tr. (Day 1) 91:24-25 where the Respondent noted that the Claimants have not asserted a discrimination claim under the BIT. This submission was not specifically refuted.\n\n442.\n\nThird, the contested measures are not - as the *Vivendi II* tribunal would have it -\"improper and without justification\". The Tribunal has reviewed the context in which these measures were introduced above. It has found that the Czech Republic introduced the measures in pursuit of legitimate objectives including restoring equilibrium in the solar sector, protecting consumers from substantial electricity bill increases and augmenting budgetary resources in a time of global financial crisis. The measures were carefully tailored to limit their effects to those solar RES producers that had benefited from the solar boom. In the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot agree that the disputed measures were either arbitrary or unreasonable.\n\n443.\n\nIn conclusion, no \"deliberate harm\" was caused to the Claimants. As a result, the Claimants\u2019 FET claims in this respect cannot succeed.302\n\nIn their RfA, the Claimants alleged that the contested measures \"also violated the prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory treatment\" (\u00a762), repeated this allegation in a one line sentence in their SoC (\u00a717). This claim was not reiterated in their later submissions or at the hearing. Further, the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Claimants had not asserted a discrimination claim under the Treaty was not specifically refuted. Thus, the Tribunal believes that the Claimants no longer pursue this claim. To the extent that they do, the reasoning above would equally apply to reject the claim.\n\n444.\n\nIn their later submissions and in course of the hearing, the Claimants appeared to suggest a different breach of the FET standard. They contended that the Czech Republic failed to act promptly and adequately address the solar boom.303 They also suggested that the Respondent knew earlier that it would introduce the contested measures, but chose not to do so, a conduct which \"would be the equivalent of bad faith and be squarely incompatible with the [FET] obligation\". Neither argument was fully substantiated. In the absence of further detail, the Tribunal cannot but reject both arguments. In any event, as mentioned above, the measures complained of were introduced in 2010 pursuant to discussions that had begun in 2009, and were taken in response to the solar boom of late 2008, 2009 and 2010, which is when the Claimants\u2019 invested. Thus, it is unclear to the Tribunal how the challenged measures could have been introduced earlier. Further and in any event, it is not the role of this Tribunal to second-guess the Czech Republic\u2019s discretion in the manner in which it carries out its policies. Its role is to examine the propriety of the impugned measures, which it has done above.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Comments on the New Evidence, section B.II.\n\n445.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the FET claims. It finds that the Czech Republic had not furnished any guarantees of the kind alleged by the Claimants. Neither had the Czech Republic \"deliberately attracted\" and then harmed solar RES producers.\n\n446.\n\nThe Claimants accept that, absent a stabilization guarantee, changes to domestic law for a legitimate public purpose would not entail liability.304 As the Tribunal has found no stabilization guarantee of the kind suggested by the Claimants and has held that the contested measures were introduced for a legitimate purpose, the Tribunal could stop its analysis here. Indeed, on the Claimants\u2019 own case, it need not review the other alleged violations of the Treaty. For the sake of completeness however, the Tribunal will briefly review the Claimants\u2019 full protection and security and umbrella clause claims below.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7297-301 (\"[A]rbitral tribunals clearly emphasize the following: on the one hand, the legislator may exercise its sovereign regulatory powers by changing the law for a legitimate public purpose. On the other hand, it cannot do so with respect to the foreign investor to whom, in the exercise of the same sovereign powers, it has promised the contrary, otherwise compensation for damages is due.\").\n\n**E. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nThe Claimants submit that many tribunals have accepted that the standard of full protection and security includes the obligation to provide legal security, as well as the obligation \"not to (partially) rescind rights granted under the respective legal regime\".305 On this basis, they claim that by taking the impugned measures, the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\nReply, \u00a7280.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nThe Respondent denies the Claimants\u2019 submissions. According to it, the FPS standard cannot serve to hold a State liable for changes in its domestic law.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n449.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"Investments by investors from either Contracting State shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the respective other Contracting State\".\n\n450.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the full protection and security obligation reflected in Article 4(1) of the Treaty requires the Respondent to provide both physical and legal security. The latter contains an obligation \"not to (partially) rescind rights granted under the respective legal regime\".306 The Respondent breached Article 4(2) of the Treaty when it abrogated the \"legal protection\" offered to the Claimants which consisted of \"the [Tax Incentives] and the guarantees of Act 180/2005\".307\n\nReply, \u00a7280.\n\nSoC, \u00a7218. See also Reply, \u00a7277.\n\n451.\n\nThe full protection and security standard requires a state to provide a framework that protects an investment from adverse interference. On the basis of the analysis above, there has been no adverse interference with the Claimants\u2019 investment. Indeed, the Tribunal has found that the Czech Republic had not furnished any guarantees of the kind alleged by the Claimants. What it had guaranteed was that solar PV plants that met specific technical and economic parameters could expect a FIT set at a level that allowed a 15 year payback of capital expenses and at least a 7% rate of return over a period of 15 years. These guarantees continue to be met for the Claimants. As a result, the question of the Respondent breaching its guarantees does not arise.308\n\nTo the extent relevant, the Tribunal notes that both the introduction of the Solar Levy as well as the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives were reasonable.\n\n**F. UMBRELLA CLAUSE**\n----------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------\n\n452.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Treaty, the Respondent is under an obligation to comply with its contractual and statutory obligations. By abrogating and circumventing the guarantees given in Act 180, the Respondent has breached such obligations.309\n\nSoC, \u00a7170.\n\n453.\n\nFor the Claimants, the wording of Article 7(2) of the Treaty is clear. It applies to both contractual and statutory commitments of the Respondent. This is all the more evident when one looks at the language, which speaks of other obligations \"entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors\", which only requires that the Respondent\u2019s obligations relate to investments. It does not require that such obligations be entered into with a particular investor. This interpretation is supported by Article 7(1) of the Treaty, which identifies legal obligations under domestic law as a potential source of obligations.\n\n454.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the Respondent\u2019s argument according to which, read with Article 7(1), Article 7(2) is limited to contractual obligations. They contend that Article 7(1) is a \"conflict clause\" that \"regulates conflicts between - potential conflicts between the Treaty and national laws which have treatment in line with the Treaty but which is more favorable or conflicts between the treaty and other treaties which are more favorable\".310 Article 7(1) and 7(2) thus address different issues. Furthermore, the Claimants emphasize that Article 7(2) refers to \"any\" other obligation, which shows that statutory obligations fall under Article 7(2) of the Treaty.\n\nTr. (Day 4) 609:5-10.\n\n455.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants challenge the Respondent\u2019s view that the umbrella clause only applies to a specific obligation vis-a-vis an investor or to an obligation relating to an individual investment. According to them, the umbrella clause applies whenever a statutory commitment is made to induce investments. Article 7(2) in particular applies in respect of obligations \"entered into with regard to investments\". In any event, even accepting the Czech Republic\u2019s position, by granting the ERO licenses, the Respondent entered into a specific obligation with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investments. According to the Claimants, \"Section 6(1)(b)(2) of Act 180/2005 is the functional equivalent of an offer. It\u2019s not made directly an offer to conclude a contract because Respondent chose to regulate renewables differently, but nevertheless it is an offer made to investors because it\u2019s not valid immediately for everyone [...] you first have to fulfill certain conditions\".311\n\nTr. (Day 4) 615:18-24.\n\n456.\n\nThe Claimants further reject the Respondent\u2019s position that the impugned measures cannot constitute a breach of the umbrella clause because the Respondent was \"entitled\" to change its laws. They assert that the umbrella clause would be deprived of meaning if a state could simply change its laws. According to the Claimants, \"what is crucial is whether the State lawfully invokes the law as it existed at the time of investment - or whether it changes the law subsequently in order to escape its obligations. In the former case, there is no breach of the umbrella clause. In the latter case, and in the case at hand, there is such a breach\".312\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7212-213.\n\n457.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants deny that the Constitutional Court settled the issue, as the Court undertook a limited review and did not address individual cases.\n\n458.\n\nFinally, for the Claimants, the legal authorities invoked by the Respondent are irrelevant because they merely distinguish contractual obligations from \"general commitments\" or \"general requirements\" under domestic law. The authorities do not consider \"whether specific guarantees for a specific period given in a law qualify as an obligation in terms of the given umbrella clause\".313\n\nReply, \u00a7167.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 7(1) of the Treaty contains the words \"legislation\" as well as \"obligations\". If the Contracting Parties had meant the term \"obligations\" to include \"legislation\", they would not have used two different terms in Article 7(1). Doing so, they showed that the term \"obligations\" used in Article 7(2) of the Treaty cannot be understood to include \"legislation\". This is further demonstrated by the use of the word \"other\" in Article 7(2), which excludes \"legislation\" identified in Article 7(1).\n\n460.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the obligations allegedly breached must first exist under Czech law. The Claimants have failed to identify any relevant obligation. In particular, the Claimants have not shown \"that they ha[ve] either a vested or actionable right to: (1) freedom from any measures that would affect a solar plant\u2019s excess profits but leave intact the targeted profitability benchmarks and tariff levels; and (2) freedom from any changes at all to the Income Tax Provisions (either for a particular period of time, or indefinitely\").314\n\nRej. \u00a7425.\n\n461.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, even if Article 7(2) of the Treaty were to apply to the breach of a statutory provision, such provision should be directed to specific investments and investors. Here, the Claimants have identified Act 180 as the only source of the obligations which the Czech Republic entered into with respect to their investments. Yet, Act 180 was neither directed specifically to the Claimants, nor to their investments. Section 6 of Act 180 was merely a direction given to the regulator, namely to the ERO.\n\n462.\n\nThe Respondent finally asserts that, even assuming that obligations under general Czech law were covered by Article 7(2), the Claimants must establish that these obligations were breached, which they have not done. In addition, the alleged breach of a statutory provision must be assessed \"in the context of the legal order of which it forms a part\"315. As the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Administrative Court have both held that the Czech Parliament did not breach Act 180, it would be incorrect to consider that the Respondent breached Article 7(2) of the Treaty by introducing the Solar Levy.\n\nSoD, \u00a7240.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n463.\n\nArticle 7 of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) If the legislation of either Contracting State or international obligations existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting States in addition to this Treaty contain any provisions, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors from the other Contracting State to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Treaty, such provisions shall prevail over this Treaty to the extent that they are more favourable.\n\n(2) Each Contracting State shall fulfil any other obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors from the respective other Contracting State\".316\n\nExh. C-078, Art. 7. The translation offered by the Respondent is substantially similar: \"Each Contracting Party shall fulfil any other obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors from the respective other Contracting Party.\" SoD, \u00a7216. In any event, the Respondent seems to accept the Claimants\u2019 translation. See Rej., \u00a7418.\n\n464.\n\nArticle 7(2) of the Treaty imposes an obligation on each Contracting Party to fulfill its \"other obligation[s]\" with regard to investments. If a Contracting Party does not fulfill its obligations, an investor may claim a breach of Article 7(2) of the Treaty. In other words, for Article 7(2) to come into operation, the Contracting Party must first be obliged to do something. If there is no obligation, *a fortiori*, there can be no breach. In the words of the *Oxus Gold* tribunal:\n\n\"For a claim to be based on an umbrella clause [\u2026] the claimant must establish, among others, that it is the creditor of the \"obligation\" at stake and this requirement has two aspects:\n\nFirst of all, the obligation which is alleged to be breached must exist. If the obligation brought forward by the claimant does not exist, it can a fortiori not be breached.\"317\n\n*Oxus Gold plc v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 17 December 2015, \u00a7\u00a7366-367.\n\n465.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"[t]he 20-year fixed feed-in tariff established by Act 180/2005 and Public notices 150/2007 as well as the tax exemption constitute \"obligations\" covered by Article 7(2) BIT.\"318 However, the Tribunal has already held that Act 180 imposes no obligation on the Czech Republic to set or retain the FIT at a level above that which allows a 15 year payback of capital expenses and a 7% return for solar RES producers that met prescribed conditions. The Tribunal has also held that the Respondent was not obliged to maintain the Tax Incentives as they existed at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investment. Consequently, in the absence of an obligation of the Respondent, the claim for breach of such (non-existing) obligation must fail. Accordingly, the Claimants\u2019 umbrella clause claim is dismissed.\n\nSoC, \u00a7179.\n\n466.\n\nIn closing, the Tribunal notes that the decision in *Invesmart v. Czech Republic* also dismissed the umbrella clause claim on the basis that the claimant had not established the existence of an obligation of the Czech Republic to provide state aid *.*319\n\n*Invesmart*, \u00a7526 (\"The Tribunal is of the opinion that the claim founded on Article 3(4) of the BIT cannot succeed. Even if the existence of an \"umbrella clause\" elevates breaches of a contract to breaches of the BIT, a point on which tribunals before and after Eureko have reached opposite conclusions, or extends beyond contractual breaches, the Claimant has not established that there was any firm, unconditional undertaking, whether contractual or not, to provide state aid. An \"obligation\" to provide aid would require the establishment of a clear, unconditional commitment which would specify its essential terms including the amount of aid, the date to be provided and so on. No such obligation has been proven by the Claimant.\").\n\n**G. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n467.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Respondent did not breach the substantive standards invoked by the Claimants, i.e. FET, FPS, and the umbrella clause.\n\n468.\n\nHaving reached the conclusions above, the Tribunal need not decide on the Respondent\u2019s arguments that \"even if Claimants succeed to persuade the Tribunal on issues of liability, the Tribunal would still be precluded under the applicable EU law from rendering a binding damages award in Claimants\u2019 favor\".320\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the Amicus Curiae Submission, \u00a742. The Commission made similar arguments (Commission\u2019s Application, \u00a7\u00a7186 et. seq.), which need not be addressed for the same reasons.\n\n469.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the majority has considered the content of the dissenting opinion. Expressed in no uncertain terms, the dissenter\u2019s arguments have given the majority the opportunity to test the resilience of its legal analysis and the validity of its conclusions. Having revisited its views in light of the dissent, the majority cannot but confirm the result of its analysis, according to which the Czech Republic guaranteed to the Claimants (i) a return of their investment or payback of capital expenses in 15 years and (ii) a return *on* investment or profit of at least 7% p.a. over 15 and later 20 years, which guarantees were met in the present case. This result derives from Section 6 of Act 180 and the implementing regulation to which it refers, and is shared by the Czech Republic\u2019s highest courts.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n470.\n\nIn their cost submission, the Claimants sought the following relief:\n\n\"Claimants seek the reimbursement of its costs incurred in this arbitration until 15 June 2016 in the value of:\n\nCosts of legal representation: [REDACTED] \u20ac\n\nExpert fees: [REDACTED] \u20ac\n\nCosts for translations: [REDACTED] \u20ac\n\nTravel and accommodation expenses for legal team and witnesses: [REDACTED] \u20ac\n\nTotal costs as of June 15, 2016: [REDACTED] \u20ac\"\n\n471.\n\nThe Claimants subsequently added the costs incurred by them since their submission. The total costs claimed by the Claimants increased to EUR [REDACTED].321\n\nClaimants Comments on the Commission Decision, p.6.\n\n472.\n\nFor their part, the Respondent sought the following relief:\n\n\"[The] Claimants be ordered to pay all of the Czech Republic\u2019s costs and expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding (including attorney fees and expenses), in the amount of USD [REDACTED] as well as the Czech Republic\u2019s share of the costs incurred by the Tribunal and the PCA, in the amount of EUR [REDACTED] to date.\"\n\n473.\n\nSection 13 of the Terms of Appointment provides that the members of the Tribunal shall be paid at the rate of EUR [REDACTED] per hour for the time spent on the arbitration, but in any event not in excess of EUR [REDACTED] in the aggregate. Computed at these rates but then significantly reduced so as not to exceed the capped amount, the fees of the members of the Tribunal amount to: Mr. Gary Born EUR [REDACTED] Judge Peter Tomka EUR [REDACTED] and Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler EUR [REDACTED].322 The fees of the Secretary of the Tribunal amount to EUR 30,000 reduced from EUR [REDACTED], to comply with the agreed cap.\n\nThe recording of the time spent was stopped in the summer of 2017, in view of the fact that there were no funds advanced by the Claimants left.\n\n474.\n\nArbitrators and Tribunal Secretary expenses amount to EUR [REDACTED]. The PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR [REDACTED] for its registry services. Other costs of the arbitration amount to EUR [REDACTED]. The PCA will shortly provide the Parties with a final statement of account.\n\n475.\n\nAs a consequence, the total of arbitration costs amounts to EUR [REDACTED] rounded to EUR [REDACTED].\n\n476.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to order the Respondent to bear the Claimants\u2019 costs for legal representation and assistance of EUR [REDACTED], while, on their part, the Respondent insists that the Claimants should bear the Respondent\u2019s costs of USD and EUR [REDACTED].\n\n477.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is an *ad hoc* investment arbitration governed by the procedural rules contained in the Treaty and Chapter 12 of the PILA. Article 10(2) of the Treaty provides that the procedural rules contained in Article 9(5) of the Treaty in respect of interstate disputes \"appropriately\" apply in investor-states cases. Article 9(5) provides the following guidance regarding costs:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in arbitration proceedings; the cost of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may decide on a different allocation of costs.\"\n\n478.\n\nArticle 9(5) of the Treaty applies if the Parties have not agreed otherwise. The coincidence that each Party claims that its opponent should bear the costs of the arbitration cannot be regarded as a meeting of the minds to deviate from the solution agreed by the Contracting States. Noting that Chapter 12 of the PILA contains no guidance on cost allocation either, the Tribunal considers that the Treaty governs the cost allocation.\n\n479.\n\nArticle 9(5) means that, in addition to the costs which it incurred in connection with the arbitration, each side bears (i) 50% of the fees of the President of the Tribunal; (ii) 50% of all costs and expenses of the arbitration (which includes the fees and expenses of the institution and of the Secretary); and (iii) 100% of the fees of the arbitrator whom it appointed. Article 9(5) also empowers the Tribunal to apply a different allocation, for which the Tribunal sees no reason under the circumstances.\n\n480.\n\nAccordingly, in application of the BIT and taking into account the caps agreed with the Parties, the Claimants shall bear, in addition to their own legal fees and other expenses, the following costs:\n\n(i) 50% of the president\u2019s fees, i.e. EUR [REDACTED] ;\n\n(ii) 100% of its party-appointed arbitrator\u2019s fees, i.e. EUR [REDACTED] and expenses of EUR [REDACTED].\n\n(iii) 50% of all other expenses, comprising EUR [REDACTED] (Secretary\u2019s fees), EUR (PCA fees), EUR [REDACTED] (President and Secretary\u2019s expenses) and other expenses of EUR [REDACTED].\n\nTotal: EU [REDACTED] Rrounded to [REDACTED]\n\n481.\n\nAs for the Respondent, it shall bear, in addition to its own fees and expenses, the following costs:\n\n(i) 50% of the president\u2019s fees, i.e. EUR [REDACTED] ;\n\n(ii) 100% of its party-appointed arbitrator\u2019s fees, i.e. EUR [REDACTED] and expenses of EUR [REDACTED] ;\n\n(iii) 50% of all other expenses, as set out in subparagraph 480 (iii);\n\nTotal: EUR [REDACTED] rounded to.\n\n482.\n\nEach side has advanced EUR [REDACTED] on account of fees and expenses. From such deposits, the PCA shall pay the fees and expenses of the Arbitrators, the Secretary and its own fees and costs, in accordance with the provisions of the BIT, as implemented above. The remaining balance of EUR [REDACTED] shall be returned to the Respondent.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n483.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\ni. Decides that it has jurisdiction over Claimant 4 JSW Solar (zwei) GmbH & Co. KG;\n\nii. Decides that the Respondent has not acted in breach of Articles 2(1), 4(1) or 7(2) of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 2 October 1990;\n\niii.
