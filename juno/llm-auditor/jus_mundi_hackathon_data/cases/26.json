For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without prejudice to Article 10 of this Agreement (Disputes between Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n2. If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months, the dispute shall upon request of the investor be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. Such arbitral tribunal shall be established as follows:\n\na) The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case. Unless the parties to the dispute have agreed otherwise, each of them shall appoint one arbitrator and these two arbitrators shall nominate a chairman who shall be a national of a third State. The arbitrators are to be appointed within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration and the chairman is to be nominated within further two months.\n\nb) If the periods specified in paragraph (a) of this Article have not been observed, either party to the dispute may, in the absence of any other arrangements, invite the President of the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to make the necessary appointments. If the President is prevented from carrying out the said function or if he is a national of a Contracting Party the provisions in paragraph (5) of Article 10 of this Agreement shall be applied mutatis mutandis.\n\nc) Unless the parties to the dispute have agreed otherwise, the tribunal shall determine its procedure. Its decisions are final and binding. Each Contracting Party shall ensure the recognition and execution of the arbitral award.\n\nd) Each party to the dispute shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the costs of the chairman and the remaining cost shall be borne in equal parts by both parties to the dispute. The tribunal may, however, in its award decide on a different proportion of costs to be borne by the parties and this award shall be binding on both parties.\n\n3. In the event of both Contracting Parties having become members of the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, disputes under this article may, upon request of the investor, as an alternative to the procedure mentioned in paragraph 2 of this article, be submitted to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n4. The Contracting State which is a party to the dispute shall at no time whatever during a procedure specified in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article or during the execution of the respective sentence assert as a defense the fact that the investor has received compensation under an insurance contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage.\n\n5. Neither Contracting State shall pursue through diplomatic channels a dispute submitted to arbitration, unless the other Contracting State does not abide by or comply with the award rendered by an arbitral tribunal.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 7 April 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever s.r.o. against the Czech Republic (the \"Request\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 14 April 2017, ICSID asked the requesting parties to provide further information in support of the Request. That information was submitted on 2 May 2017.\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 May 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, as supplemented, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding, arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a national of Spain, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; John Beechey, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Claimants; and Vaughan Lowe, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n14.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Ms. Gastrell was subsequently replaced by Ms. Anna Holloway, Legal Counsel.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 24 January 2018 by teleconference.\n\n16.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 23 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed schedule for the proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 28 June 2018, the Claimants filed a Memorial on the merits, together with the Witness Statements of Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, Mr. Milan Coller, Dr. Robert Zugar, Mr. Marek Tich\u00fd, and Mr. Martin Langmajer, the Expert Reports of Dr. Veronica Tomoszkov\u00e1 (including Exhibits VT-0001 through VT-0024), Mr. Kai Schumacher of AlixPartners GmbH (including Exhibits AP-001 through AP-074), Exhibits C-0016 through C-0100, and Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0048).\n\n18.\n\nOn 25 July 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it would not request bifurcation of the proceeding.\n\n19.\n\nOn 14 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning production of documents.\n\n20.\n\nOn 6 November 2018, the Respondent requested a three-week extension for filing of its Counter-Memorial citing difficulties in meeting the original deadline due to a number of departures at the division of the Ministry of Finance in charge of investment arbitration and other parallel filings that the state had to manage.\n\n21.\n\nOn 7 November 2018, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s request for extension noting that no compelling reason was stated to justify such an extension which would unduly disrupt the procedural calendar. In the event that the extension were granted to the Respondent, the Claimants argued, a corresponding extension for the Claimants would serve no practical purpose as the Claimants\u2019 counsel would be engaged in another hearing at that time.\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 November 2018, the Tribunal decided to grant an additional three weeks to each Party for preparation of their briefs. The Tribunal gave the Parties the liberty of choosing how they each wished to allocate the total additional time between the two written submissions each Party still had to present.\n\n23.\n\nOn 19 November 2018, the Parties submitted agreed amendments to the procedural timetable and the Tribunal adopted those amendments on 28 November 2018.\n\n24.\n\nIn accordance with the amended timetable, on 5 December 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Preliminary Objections, together with the Witness Statements of Dr. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hude\u010dek and Ms. V\u011bra Topi\u010dova, the Expert Reports of KPMG (including Exhibits KPMG-1 through KPMG-6) and Prof. Stanislav Kade\u010dka (including Exhibits SK-1 through SK-84), Exhibits R-1 through R-26, and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-143).\n\n25.\n\nOn 13 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning production of documents.\n\n26.\n\nOn 3 July 2019, the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, together with the Witness Statements of Mr. Bo\u0159ek Votava, Mr. Franti\u0161ek Nov\u00e1\u010dek, Mr. Jaroslav Mal\u010d\u00e1nek, and Mr. Martin Turnovsk\u00fd, the Second Witness Statements of Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, Mr. Milan Coller, Mr. Martin Langmajer, and Mr. Marek Tich\u00fd, Second Expert Reports of Prof. Dr. Veronika Tomoscov\u00e1, (including Annexes 1 through 6 and Exhibits VT-0025 through VT-0083) and Mr. Kai Schumacher of AlixPartners GmbH (including Appendices AP-G through AP-L and Exhibits AP-075 through AP-121), Exhibits C-0076a, C-0106 through C-0212, and Legal Authorities CL-0049 through CL-0108.\n\n27.\n\nOn 6 November 2019, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and a Reply on Preliminary Objections, together with the Witness statements of Ms. Silvie \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1, Mr. Ondr\u011bj Boh\u00e1\u010d, and Mr. Mat\u011bj Stropnick\u00fd, the Second Witness statements of Ms. V\u011bra Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and Dr. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hude\u010dek, the Second Expert Reports of Prof. Stanislav Kade\u010dka (including Exhibits SKII-1 through SKII-36) and KPMG (including Exhibits KPMG-7 through KPMG-37), Exhibits R-27 through R-76, and Legal Authorities RL-144 through RL-212.\n\n28.\n\nOn 28 November 2019, the Claimants requested leave to submit new evidence into the record. The Respondent confirmed that it had no objection on 5 December 2019, following which, on 8 December 2019, the Tribunal instructed the Claimant to file new exhibits.\n\n29.\n\nOn 4 December 2019, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, together with Legal Authorities CL-0109 and CL-0110.\n\n30.\n\nOn 11 December 2019, the Claimants submitted additional Exhibits C-0213 through C-0215 in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions.\n\n31.\n\nOn 16 December 2019, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n32.\n\nOn 17 December 2019, the Claimants requested leave to submit additional evidence and indicated that the Respondent did not object to the request.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal granted leave to the Claimants to submit two new additional exhibits on 19 December 2019, pursuant to which, on 20 December 2019, the Claimants submitted further Exhibits C-0216 and C-0217.\n\n34.\n\nOn 6 January 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n35.\n\nOn 7 January 2020, in response to a request from the Respondent, the Claimants submitted replacement versions of the Exhibits AP-083 and AP-084 to Mr. Schumacher\u2019s Second Expert Report, containing additional translations.\n\n36.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum was held in Paris, France from 26 January to 30 January 2020 (the \"Hearing\").

The Claimants cited Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1\u2019s alleged \"untruthful testimony\" as an exceptional circumstance to justify the admission of new evidence.\n\n46.\n\nAfter invitation from the Tribunal, on 3 June 2020, the Respondent submitted its comments upon the Claimants\u2019 request. The Respondent maintained that the request was \"belated and unwarranted.\" It argued that the Claimants\u2019 request should be rejected noting that the allegedly new evidence had been available to the Claimants since before this arbitration proceeding began. The introduction of the proposed new evidence would cause prejudice to the Respondent since Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 would not be able to respond to it.\n\n47.\n\nOn 16 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 allowing the Claimants to submit the requested new evidence and allowing the Respondent, in turn, to submit an affidavit from Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 addressing the new evidence. The Tribunal also granted the extensions on the remaining procedural submissions.\n\n48.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, on 18 June 2020, the Claimant filed an additional exhibit C-219. The Respondent submitted the Affidavit of Ms. Silvie \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 on 29 June 2020.\n\n49.\n\nThe Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 15 July 2020, and their submissions on costs on 6 August 2020.\n\n50.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 5 October 2021.\n\n**III.** **FACTS**\n------------------\n\n51.\n\nMr. Sebastian Pawlowski, a citizen of Switzerland, is the 100% shareholder and sole statutory representative of Pawlowski AG; he is also the executive director of Projekt Sever s.r.o, which is 100% owned by Pawlowski AG.1\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 1.\n\n52.\n\nMr. Pawlowski was among the first foreigners to begin investing in the Czech Republic in the early 1990s.2 Over time, Mr. Pawlowski became involved in a variety of entrepreneurial and non-profit activities in the Czech Republic, primarily through Pawlowski AG. These activities included his involvement and participation in numerous large scale property developments, his co-founding of a business with retail locations throughout the Czech Republic and his investment in several news and media companies in the country. Mr. Pawlowski has also been involved in the development of cultural centers in the country. He is the founder of the Franz Kafka Museum and the Alphonse Mucha Museum, both of which are located in Prague.3\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 4.\n\nPawlowski WS I, paras. 7-9.\n\nThe City of Prague\n------------------\n\n53.\n\nFollowing a peaceful transition of power, the country then known as Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections in half a century in the summer of 1990. Not long thereafter, in 1993 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the independent countries of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The Czech Republic\u2019s new government implemented a number of economic reforms, including the privatization of state-owned industry and the removal of price controls, as the country worked towards the goal of establishing a robust market economy.\n\n54.\n\nDue to these changes, the City of Prague developed rapidly and became an important economic centre. Today it is one of the most economically developed areas within the European Union.4 Prague\u2019s economic growth has attracted many people to move to the city, resulting in consistent high demand for residential real estate.5 This demand is expected to continue to grow, as the city\u2019s strong economy and very low unemployment attract new residents, with estimates forecasting a 20% population increase by 2050.6\n\nSchumacher ER I, para. 51, referring to AP-33 (European Commission, Region Prague).\n\nSchumacher ER I, chapter 6.4.\n\nSchumacher ER I, para. 52, referring to: AP-30; AP-35, p. 5.\n\n55.\n\nThe City of Prague is the highest municipal authority. It is headed by three democratically elected bodies: the Mayor, the Prague City Council and the Prague City Assembly. Management, directed by a Chief Executive, is divided into various sections, including the Spatial Planning and Development Sections (the latter subsequently renamed Prague Institute of Planning and Development), which is responsible for zoning issues.7\n\nOECD, \"The Governance of Land Use in the Czech Republic: The Case of Prague\", OECD Publishing, Paris 2017, pp. 95-96, **R-6**.\n\n56.\n\nWithin the City of Prague there are 57 Municipal Districts - or boroughs - each with its own legislative branch (the District Assembly) and executive branch (the District Council and District Mayor). Prague's Municipal Districts are congregated into 22 numbered administrative districts, which perform administrative functions for the Municipal Districts within their zone.8 One such administrative district is \"Prague-22 Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves\" - which performs administrative functions for itself and four neighbouring Municipal Districts, including the District of Benice9.\n\nColler WS I, para. 3.\n\nColler WS I, para. 5.\n\n57.\n\nThe dispute in the present case relates to the change of the zoning regulation affecting a certain tract of land, with an area of approximately 270,000 m210 located in the Municipal District of Benice and bordering the District of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves (the \"**Project Area**\"). The Project Area is shown on this cadastral map:11\n\nJudgment of the Prague Supreme Administrative Court, 6 Aos 2/2013, 26 February 2014, p.2, **C-95**; note, as pointed out by Claimants in C-II, fn. 121: the precise total land area is stated differently in various planning and official documents. See, e.g., Study for New Benice Residential Complex, KAAMA s.r.o. architects, June 2004, **C-137**, p. 11 (276,030 mXXXX2); Study of the Municipal Districts of Prague Benice Skalka and Part of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves (submitted as an attachment to Application for zoning plan change by Prague- Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves), dated 2 October 2003, **R-8**, p. 3 (270,000 mXXXX2); TaK, First Architectural Concept, 12 October 2007, **C-18**, p. 3 (284,829 mXXXX2); Tichy wS, para. 8 (the project area spanned \"almost 285,000 mXXXX2 of land\"); EIA Screening Decision of the Environmental Division of the Municipal Office of Prague, 17 July 2009, **C-53**, p. 1 (\"approximately 290,300 mXXXX2\").\n\nCadastral map illustrating plots of land owned by Projekt Sever, **C-32**.\n\n58.\n\nTo properly understand the dispute, the Tribunal will first explain how zoning plan changes are procured and approved in the City of Prague [**1.**] and thereafter it will describe how the zoning plan of the Project Area changed over time [**2.**].\n\n**1.** **T****he procurement of zoning plans**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nLand use planning in the Czech Republic is administered through a combination of state administration and territorial self-governance.12 Generally, the designated use for land in the Czech Republic is established through two higher planning norms: the \"Spatial Development Policy\", which coordinates the land planning activities of the different regions, and the \"Regional Development Principles\", which establishes a strategic plan for the development of a specific territory.13\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER I, paras. 33, 40, 44.\n\nKade\u010dka ER I, para. 56.\n\n60.\n\nThe procurement of a zoning plan change typically proceeds through several established steps, with each stage involving notification to and comment from various authorities, city Districts and the public. Proposed changes to Prague's land use plan are so frequent that they are grouped together into so-called \"waves\", which proceed through the process together.14 Overall, the process for a zoning change of the land use plan is a long and democratic administrative process, which is divided into several consecutive steps and which requires decision-making from the Prague City Assembly (the highest political body, elected by the citizens of Prague) at all relevant stages.15\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER I, para. 42.\n\nBoh\u00e1\u010d WS, para. 24.\n\n61.\n\nFirst Phase - Decision to Procure: the initial step is a formal act (a \"**Decision to procure**\") in which the Prague City Council initiates a zoning plan change. This may be made at the request of any municipal District, acting on its own initiative, or on the initiative of a private individual. However, any initiative for a zoning plan change by a private individual still must be submitted via the municipal District in which the area is located.16\n\nArticle 17(2), Act No. 50/1976 Coll. on spatial planning and building regulations, **VT-13**; Tomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 166.\n\n62.\n\nSecond Phase - Approval of an \"**Outline**\": the second phase requires the Zoning Plan Division of the Prague Municipal Office (the \"**Procurer**\") to prepare a draft Outline, which is made available for review and comment by all interested Authorities and city Districts, as well as by the public; thereafter, the Prague City Assembly must approve the Outline.17\n\nArticle 20(2) and (6), Act No. 50/1976 Coll. on spatial planning and building regulations, **VT-13**; Article 11(3) of the Decree of the Ministry of Regional Development No. 135/2001 Coll., on land use planning background materials and land use planning documentation, **VT-14**.\n\n63.\n\nThird Phase - the \"**Concept**\": If the Outline includes a requirement for an environmental impact assessment, the elaboration and approval of a zoning change Concept is the next stage of the procurement process.18 During the procurement of the Concept, the environmental authority must approve the environmental impact assessment. The Concept is again subject to public discussion.19\n\nArticle 48(1) of the Building Act 2006 (version valid till 31 December 2012), **VT-12**.\n\nArticle 48(2) of the Building Act 2006 (version valid till 31 December 2012), **VT-12**; Article 25(4)-(6) of the Generally Binding Ordinance No. 55/2000 Coll. of capital city of Prague, by which the Statute of the capital city of Prague is enacted (\"the Prague Statute\") (version valid till 31 October 2009), **VT-15**.\n\n64.\n\nFourth Phase - the preparation of a \"**Draft**\": Based on public discussion and all the submitted statements, comments and objections, the Procurer prepares a Draft.20 Then, the Draft zoning change is subject to public discussion and all interested authorities and the superior planning authority submit their statements.21 After the public discussion, the Procurer assesses the results of the public discussion and, if necessary, weighs competing views, reviews the compliance of the draft with the law and superior land use planning documents and prepares the reasoning for the zoning change.22\n\nArticle 49(1) of the Building Act 2006 (version valid till 31 December 2012), **VT-12**.\n\nArticle 50(2) of the Building Act 2006 (version valid till 31 December 2012), **VT-12**; Article 25 (7-9) of the Prague Statute (version valid till 31 October 2009), **VT-15**.\n\nArticle 53(4-5) of the Building Act 2006 (version valid till 31 December 2012), **VT-12**.\n\n65.\n\nFinal Phase - Approval: The Prague City Assembly considers the Draft, including the reasoning, and approves it by majority.

There were two attempts to obtain such re-zoning.\n\nResolution of the Benice District Assembly, 13 March 2002, **C-19**; Resolution of the Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves District Assembly, 10 July 2002, **C-20**; Application for zoning plan change by Prague-Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, 2 October 2003, **C-21**.\n\n**2.1 F****irst rezoning attempt** **: Z 0592/04**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nSometime in the early 2000s a first change in the zoning plan of the Project Area was formally initiated and discussed within the administration of the City of Prague; the request, which received the number Z 0592/04, proposed that the use of the land be reclassified as residential with housing for approximately 800 residents.25 The map below, taken from file Z 0592/04, establishes that this first attempt affected the Project Area:26\n\nAnnex to Draft Zoning Change Z 0592/04, **R-37**, p. 1\n\nAnnex to Draft Zoning Change Z 0592/04, **R-37**, p. 4.\n\n68.\n\nThe first attempt was unsuccessful: in August 2002, file Z 0592/04 received a negative opinion from the Environmental Division, because of its proximity to a natural park:\n\n\"From the viewpoint of the interests protected by us, the change is inadmissible - the Boti\u010d - Mil\u00ed\u010dov natural park.\"27\n\nOpinion of Environmental Division of the Municipal Office of the City of Prague on Draft Change Z 0592/04, 30 August 2002, **R-39**.\n\n69.\n\nOn the basis of this negative opinion, the proposed change was rejected by the Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2003.28\n\nPrague City Assembly Resolution 08/13, 29 May 2003, **R-38**.\n\n**2.2 S****econd rezoning attempt****: Z 1294/06**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe second attempt to re-zone the Project Area, instigated by the owners of 17 real estate units29, was filed before the first zoning change had been formally rejected. On 13 March 2002, the Benice District Assembly approved this second proposal.30 A few months thereafter, on 10 July 2002, the Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves District Assembly ratified the request.31\n\nR-I, para. 36; Resolution of the Benice District Assembly, 13 March 2002, **C-19**; Resolution of the Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves District Assembly, 10 July 2002, **C-20**.\n\nResolution of the Benice District Assembly, 13 March 2002, **C-19**.\n\nResolution of the Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves District Assembly, 10 July 2002, **C-20**.\n\n71.\n\nA year later, on 2 October 2003, when Z 0592/04 had already been formally dismissed, the Deputy Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, Mr. Martin Langmajer, transferred the proposed zoning amendment (Z 1294/06) to the Development Section of the Municipal Office of Prague32. A later submission, dated 26 April 2004, specified that what was being requested was a change in the use of the Project Area from agricultural use to \"purely residential use\", consisting of \"low buildings with envisaged use rate code C.\"33 The reason given for the proposed change was:\n\n\"[t]he possible development of the territory on the border of Prague Benice and Prague Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves boroughs, i.e. the creation of a new residential complex surrounded by nature with the possibility of connecting it to commercial, cultural and sporting facilities in Prague Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and simultaneously within reach of the \u010cestlice - Pr\u016fhonice commercial zone.\"34\n\nApplication for zoning plan change by Prague-Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, 2 October 2003, **C-21**.\n\nApplication for zoning plan change by Prague-Benice, 26 April 2004, **C-22**.\n\nApplication for zoning plan change by Prague-Benice, 26 April 2004, **C-22**.\n\n72.\n\nThe Districts' proposals were included in \"wave 6\" of the various proposed changes being considered for Prague's land use plan.

In the course of their discussions, Mr. Coller and Mr. Langmajer informed Mr. Pawlowski of the ongoing efforts by the district of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves to find a developer to construct a residential project (the \"**Benice Residential Complex**\", or the \"**Project**\") in the Project Area.54\n\nPawlowski WS I, paras. 11-12; Zugar WS, paras. 6, 9; Coller WS I, paras. 13-14.\n\n**4.** **C****laimants****\u2019** **purchase of land**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nFollowing these enquiries, Pawlowski AG acquired the shelf company Projekt Sever s.r.o. in February 2007 for the purpose of realising the project.55 Projekt Sever then hired a real estate lawyer, Dr. Robert Zugar, who began to work towards concluding purchase agreements for the land in the Project Area.56 Projekt Sever eventually concluded all of the relevant land purchases between June 2007 and December 2008,57 at a time when the re-zoning was still underway (it would only be approved two years later in 2010).\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 21; Excerpt of Municipal Court Registry for Projekt Sever s.r.o., **C-5**; Long Form Extract of Municipal Court Registry for Projekt Sever s.r.o., **C-12**.\n\nZugar WS, paras. 5-22.\n\nSee *infra,* sectionsXXXX III.4.2 -XXXX III.4.4.\n\n85.\n\nProjekt Sever acquired the Project Area from different owners.

They included structures such as workshops, fencing, and outdoor lighting.65 By 1992, the military had mostly abandoned the complex and returned much of the land beneath the buildings to private individuals, but the buildings and related structures remained.

The land sold was located in the District of Benice, but it was administered by the District of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves.

For example, Projekt Sever was obliged to confirm that the residential complex could be connected to the municipal sewage system. This involved discussions with local authorities, and ultimately led to the solution that Projekt Sever would cooperate with another developer in the area, constructing a new wastewater pumping station and pressure line, at their own cost.85\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 31.\n\n102.\n\nAnother extensive process was the preparation of the documentation related to the environmental impact assessment for the project. For this, TaK had to obtain statements from a number of authorities. TaK adapted the Project\u2019s design to incorporate the comments received from and the agreements reached with the authorities.86 However, before the formal application for a planning permit could be filed, an application for an increase in density was required.\n\nTich\u00fd WS, paras. 13-14.\n\n**7.** **A****pplication for an increase in density**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nAs mentioned previously, on 16 April 2010, Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 was approved by the Prague Assembly and the Project Area was zoned as residential land87 within the category \"OB-B\", *i.e.,* residential use with a density coefficient of 0.3. This implied that Projekt Sever could build approximately 100,000 m2 of apartments and houses on the site, subject to obtaining planning and building permits.88\n\nMeasure of General Nature no. 9/2010, 26 March 2010, **C-45**.\n\nC-I, para. 80; Position statement by the Environmental Division of the Municipal Office of the City of Prague, 9 April 2008, pp. 1, 9-11, **C-36**.\n\nProposal for an increase in the density coefficient\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nSix months later, on 19 January 2011, Projekt Sever submitted a proposal to increase the density coefficient from 0.3 (\"OB-B\") to 0.5 (\"OB-C\")89 - which was the density coefficient that had originally been sought in the applications for the zoning plan change submitted by Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, but which had been reduced to OB-B by the Prague City Assembly in its resolution approving Draft Change Z 1294/07.90\n\nGuidelines for the Land Use Plan for the Capital City of Prague, 1 November 2002, **C-135**, p. 24.\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 29; Application for zoning plan change by Prague-Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, 2 October 2003, **C-21**; Application for zoning plan change by Prague-Benice, 26 April 2004, **C-22**; Approval of the increase of density coefficient by the Construction Department of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, 24 January 2011, **C-56**; City Assembly Resolution 35/38, 26 March 2010, **C-44**, p. 3; Guidelines for the Land Use Plan for the Capital City of Prague, 1 November 2002, **C-135**, p. 23.\n\n105.\n\nThe process for the increase of the density coefficient was simpler than for the zoning plan change, since it qualified as an adjustment and not as a change.91 Approvals were sought from the relevant authorities, including the Districts of Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, the Construction Department of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, the Development Section of the Municipal Office of Prague, and the Environmental Division.92\n\nC-I, para. 102.\n\nApproval of the increase of density coefficient by Uhrin\u00e8ves, 1 February 2011, **C-57**; Approval of the increase of density coefficient by Benice, 9 May 2011, **C-58**; Approval of the increase of density coefficient by the Development Section of the Municipal Office of Prague, 29 July 2011, **C-60**; Approval of the increase of density coefficient by the Environmental Division of the Municipal Office of the City of Prague, 27 May 2011, **C-59**.\n\n106.\n\nThe Construction Division of Prague 22 and the Deputy Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, Mr. Martin Turnovsk\u00fd, both approved the density increase.93\n\nApproval of the increase of density coefficient by Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, 1 February 2011, **C-57**; Approval of the increase of density coefficient by the Development Section of the Municipal Office of Prague, 29 July 2011, **C-60**; Approval of the increase of density coefficient by the Environmental Division of the Municipal Office of the City of Prague, 27 May 2011, **C-59**.\n\n107.\n\nBenice, however, opposed the density increase and on 7 March 2011 issued a negative opinion, noting that it stood by its original statement on the project from December 2008:\n\n\"Prague-Benice Borough stands by its original statement on the investment project from December 2008.

According to Claimants, there followed a number of face-to-face meetings between their representatives and Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, although she ultimately refused the request for consent and told Mr. Mal\u010d\u00e1nek that Mr. Pawlowski should meet with her in person.105\n\nLetter from Jaroslav Mal\u010d\u00e1nek to Benice, 30 January 2012, **C-70**; Mal\u010d\u00e1nek WS, para. 7.\n\nMal\u010d\u00e1nek, para. 8; HT 469:14-471:15, 490:6-18, 493:23-494:6.\n\n115.\n\nAlthough in her witness statement Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 denied having met with Mr. Mal\u010d\u00e1nek,106 during the Hearing she admitted that, in fact, she had met with Mr. Mal\u010d\u00e1nek with respect to the connection to the gas lines.107\n\nTopi\u010dov\u00e1 WS II, para. 34.\n\nHT 717:5-17.\n\n116.\n\nEventually, the Prague Property Records, Management and Use Division sent a letter warning Benice that if it failed to issue the requested statement and failed to follow the standard procedure for the planning permit process, the City, as landowner, would respond to the request. Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 also noted her irritation that Claimants continued to negotiate with Prague 22 Borough, rather than with Benice, even though the Project area was located on Benice\u2019s cadastral area.108\n\nLetter from Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 to the Municipal Office of the City of Prague, 24 September 2012, **C-74**.\n\n**9.** **T****he** **B****enice** **L****awsuit is dismissed**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nBy early 2012, the development of the Project seemed to be proceeding as planned: the zoning change had been approved, the increase in density had been accepted and the planning permit application had been submitted by Claimants\u2019 architects to the relevant authorities.\n\n118.\n\nAt that time, the Benice Lawsuit, Benice\u2019s judicial challenge against the Prague Purchase Contract was still pending. On 8 March 2012, the District Court issued its decision: it dismissed the Benice Lawsuit, with the result that the purchase price paid by Projekt Sever would flow to Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and that Benice would not be entitled to receive any funding.109 In its decision, the Court considered that Benice lacked standing to bring the case, because Municipal Districts cannot own property and act only as managers of entrusted property.110 Additionally, the Court rejected the argument that Benice was in charge of the administration of the plots of land and confirmed that Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves was the rightful administrator.111\n\nDistrict Court Judgment in file 28 C 349/2009-78, 8 March 2012, **C-64**.\n\nDistrict Court Judgment in file 28 C 349/2009-78, 8 March 2012, **C-64,** pp. 12-13.\n\nDistrict Court Judgment in file 28 C 349/2009-78, 8 March 2012, **C-64,** p. 14.\n\n119.\n\nBenice\u2019s Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 promptly decided to appeal the decision.112 On 29 May 2012, Projekt Sever sent a letter to Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, objecting to the filing of the appeal and protesting once again that Projekt Sever could not be held hostage in the dispute between Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves.113\n\nZugar WS, para. 27.\n\nLetter by Projekt Sever to the Mayor of Benice and Benice Assembly members, 29 May 2012, **C-71**.\n\n120.\n\nThe appeal was eventually dismissed,114 and Projekt Sever\u2019s purchase of land owned by the City of Prague under the Prague Purchase Contract became unassailable.\n\nZugar WS, para. 29.\n\n**10.** **B****enice****\u2019****s** **A****nnulment** **R****equest**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe extent of the Residential Complex planned by Projekt Sever was causing concern to neighbours who owned real estate in the proximity.

On 4 December 2014 the Constitutional Court confirmed the Municipal Court's decision and dismissed the complaint.127\n\nConstitutional Court Resolution, 4 December 2014, **R-15**.\n\n132.\n\nIn the second, later, case, Projekt Sever challenged the merits of the Annulment Decision itself. This case was likewise dismissed by the Constitutional Court on 21 February 2017, with the Court finding that Projekt Sever\u2019s fundamental rights under the Constitution and international treaties binding upon the Czech Republic had not been breached.128\n\nConstitutional Court Resolution, 21 February 2017, **R-13**.\n\n**11.** **D****evelopments after the** **A****nnulment** **D****ecision**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Annulment Decision had a devastating effect on the Project: the use of the land reverted to the previous category (agriculture, forest, and recreation), making any residential development impossible. Projekt Sever\u2019s application for a planning permit became moot.\n\n134.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the partial or total annulment of a zoning plan is a frequent occurrence in the Czech Republic.129 The Building Act has a specific provision, Section 55(3), establishing the principles which a Municipal authority must follow in such cases.130 Claimants say that Section 55(3) required the Prague City Assembly to take up the question of re-procurement without delay (**11.1**) - an interpretation which was initially contested by the Municipality (**11.2**; **11.3** and **11.4**). When Claimants\u2019 interpretation was supported by the Ministry of Regional Development (**11.5**), the City changed tack and in 2015 submitted the issue of re-procurement to the City Assembly - which eventually decided not to start a new zoning change procedure, leaving the Project Area with its original status of agricultural and recreational land, on which residential development is impossible (**12**).\n\n\"Changes affected by a court decision\", **R-60**.\n\nSection 55(3) of the Building Act (unofficial translation), **R-58**.\n\n135.\n\nThese events will be explained in more detail in the following sub-sections.\n\n**11.1 C****laimants****\u2019** **letter to** **M****ayor** **H****ude\u010cek**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nTwo months after the Supreme Court decision, Mr. Pawlowski (in the name of Projekt Sever) sent a letter to Mayor Hude\u010dek, explaining that the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change had caused massive damage to Projekt Sever (quantified at a minimum of CZK 2.5 billion) and requesting that the matter be included on the agenda of the next session of the City Assembly.131\n\nLetter from Projekt Sever to Mayor of the City of Prague, 7 April 2014, **C-80**.\n\n137.\n\nThe following month, Mayor Hude\u010dek reacted. By letter dated 19 May 2014, he informed Projekt Sever that Section 55(3) did not apply to this case, and that the only possible course of action was the filing of a new application for a zoning plan change.132\n\nLetter from Mayor of Prague to Projekt Sever, 19 May 2014, **C-82**.\n\n**11.2 D****iscussion at the** **C****ity** **A****ssembly** **M****eeting of** **29 M****ay** **2014**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nAt the meeting of the Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2014 (10 days after Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s letter), Assembly member Dr. Bla\u017eek asked Mayor Hude\u010dek about the delay in bringing the matter of the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change before the Assembly, noting the potential exposure to damages that the City of Prague was facing.133 (Dr. Bla\u017eek was an important figure in the \"ODS\" party, a rival and opponent of Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s \"TOP09\" party).134\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, pp. 1-2.\n\nHude\u010dek WS I, para. 16; Tomoszkov\u00e1 ER I, para. 78.\n\n139.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek responded by asserting that:\n\n\"[t]he error is not in the official procedure [of the zoning change]; the error is that the Prague City Assembly ever approved it.\"135\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 2.\n\n140.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek suggested that there had been improper conduct in obtaining the Zoning Plan Change: the Zoning Plan Division initially had a negative opinion, and undue pressure had been exerted upon it to change its opinion. He also told the Assembly that files relating to the approval of the Zoning Plan Change had been sent to the Police.136 Mayor Hude\u010dek further insinuated that there had been criminality involved in the re-zoning process.137\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 2.\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 3.\n\n**11.3 D****iscussion at the** **C****ity** **A****ssembly** **M****eeting of** **19 J****une** **2014**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nOne month later, at the 19 June 2014 City Assembly meeting, Dr. Bla\u017eek once again brought up the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, proposing that the City restart the re-procurement process, and noting the potential future risks that the City Assembly members could face if they did not act. Dr. Bla\u017eek proposed placing the matter on the agenda.138\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 19 June 2014, **C-97**, pp. 1-2; Tomoszkov\u00e1 ER I, para. 78.\n\n142.\n\nIn response to Dr. Bla\u017eek\u2019s concerns, Mayor Hude\u010dek replied that:\n\n\"If part of a zoning plan is annulled and there is no valid zoning plan in the given part of the city or territory, the assembly has to act without delay. That means that we have here the opinion of lawyers from the zoning plan division headed by Mrs. Engineer Cvetlerov\u00e1. Based on this opinion I think that we really don\u2019t have to deal with this situation now and consequently I won\u2019t submit the prints either.

Mayor Hude\u010dek then once again urged the Assembly members not to give in to pressure from Mr. Pawlowski, suggesting that all of Prague was against the Zoning Plan Change and questioning Dr. Bla\u017eek\u2019s motivations for raising the issue.141\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 11 September 2014, **C-98**, pp. 2-3.\n\n**11.5 O****pinion of the** **M****inistry of** **R****egional** **D****evelopment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn the meantime, Mayor Coller of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves had approached the Ministry of Regional Development for a legal opinion regarding the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change. The Ministry reacted on 27 October 2014, with a letter addressed to Mayor Coller, in which it explained the Ministry\u2019s position.142 The interpretation given by the Ministry to existing Czech legislation was that, upon annulment of a zoning plan change, the matter must be submitted to the relevant Municipal Assembly, which was obliged to assess the situation and to adopt a reasoned decision\n\n- to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change (which would require amending the shortcomings established in the annulment judgement) or\n\n- to confirm the annulment, in which case the previous zoning rules would apply.143\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development re Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development re Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, pp. 3-4.\n\n**12.** **T****he** **C****ity** **A****ssembly terminates the re****-****procurement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s mandate ended in November 2014. Thereafter, at some unspecified time, the City of Prague decided to change tack. The City abandoned the position that no new discussion in the Assembly was required and accepted the Ministry\u2019s interpretation of the Building Law, namely: if a zoning plan change is annulled by the Courts, the Municipal Assembly is bound to assess the annulment *(i.e.* to re-procure the file), and to adopt a reasoned decision either remedying the shortcomings found by the Courts or finding that the post-annulment situation is satisfactory.\n\n148.\n\nBy this time, Deputy Mayor Mat\u011bj Stropnick\u00fd of the Green Party had assumed responsibility for spatial planning issues in Prague. As a first step, he put the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change on the agenda of the Committee on Spatial Development meeting to be held on 15 February 2015. Subsequently, the City Council discussed the issue at its 31 March 2015 meeting and instructed Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd to submit the matter to the Assembly, with the recommendation that the procurement of Change Z 1294/07 be terminated *(i.e.* that the procurement should not be reinitiated, to correct the shortcomings found by the Court).144\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100,** p. 9.\n\nDecision of the Assembly\n------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe annulment of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 was placed on the agenda for the Prague City Assembly meeting of 14 April 2015.\n\n150.\n\nAt this meeting, Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd proposed the termination of the procurement of Change Z 1294/07.145 Mayor Krn\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 then called for a vote from the City Assembly members.146\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100,** p. 1.\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100,** p. 5.\n\n151.\n\n51 members voted in favor of the motion to terminate, and none abstained or voted against it.147\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 1.\n\n152.\n\nThus, on 14 April 2015 - 13 years after the initial idea for the re-zoning, five years after the Zoning Plan Change had been approved and 14 months after the Supreme Court\u2019s Annulment Decision - the Prague City Assembly terminated the procurement of the re-zoning of the Project Area. Thus, the land purchased by Projekt Sever to develop the Benice Residential Complex reverted to its original use as agricultural, forest and recreational land.\n\n**13.** **L****egal remedies**\n------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Parties have debated the legal remedies that Claimants could theoretically have pursued in order to resolve the situation. As summarized below, Respondent says that Claimants did not make use of all of the potential remedies available to them by law, including their ability to re-initiate the procurement for the zoning change or their ability to challenge the City Assembly\u2019s resolution itself. Claimants considered both alternatives to be futile.\n\nClaimants\u2019 ability to re-initiate the procurement of the zoning change\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAccording to Respondent\u2019s expert, Projekt Sever, as an owner of the plots affected by the Zoning Plan Change to the Prague land use plan, had the right to submit a proposal under the 2006 Building Act to procure a change to the Prague land use plan either on its own or by petitioning the District Assembly. Respondent\u2019s expert acknowledges, however, that the Prague City Assembly was not bound to accept such proposals.148\n\nKade\u010dka ER, para. 169.\n\n155.\n\nClaimants\u2019 expert, on the other hand, explains that although it is true that, following the Prague City Assembly\u2019s vote to terminate the procurement, Claimants could, in theory, have applied for a new zoning change, but they were not obliged to do so.149 Claimants\u2019 expert explains that since neither Benice, nor the Prague City Assembly supported the zoning plan change following its annulment, an application by the Claimants would have had no chance of success.150 Rather, it was the Prague planning authorities, who were obliged to promote the re-procurement, preparing a better substantiation in order to remedy the deficits identified by the Courts.151\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 165.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 166.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 165.\n\nClaimants\u2019 ability to challenge the Assembly\u2019s resolution\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants\u2019 ability to challenge the Assembly\u2019s Resolution of 14 April 2015, which terminated the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, Respondent\u2019s expert explained that if Projekt Sever considered this resolution to be an illegal interference with its rights, it could hypothetically have brought an action before the administrative courts of the Czech Republic. However, Respondent\u2019s expert also noted that because (in his view) Projekt Sever is not vested with any public subjective right that could have been curtailed, a challenge of the resolution of the Prague Assembly would not have been likely to succeed.152\n\nKade\u010dka ER, paras. 191-195.\n\n157.\n\nClaimants\u2019 expert agreed that there would have been little to no chance of success in challenging the City Assembly\u2019s resolution.153 Furthermore, Claimants\u2019 expert noted that, based on the Administrative Procedure Act, the Claimants would only have been able to submit a request, which would not actually bind the Ministry of the Interior to take action or to set the resolution of the Prague City Assembly aside.154\n\nKade\u010dka ER, para. 190.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, paras. 165-170.\n\n**IV.** **REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-------------------------------\n\nClaimants' request for relief\n-----------------------------\n\n158.\n\nIn their Memorial, Claimants submitted the following request for relief:\n\n\"For the reasons set out in this Memorial, Claimants respectfully request that the Arbitral Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n1.

They insist that the Tribunal has jurisdiction for the following reasons:\n\n- Both Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever qualify as protected investors under Article 1(1) of the BIT;\n\n- Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever made investments that qualify for protection under the BIT; and\n\n- Both Claimants have fulfilled all other obligations required under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n170.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s objection to admissibility and aver that their claims are for violations of the BIT.\n\n**VI.1.** **JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE PERSONAE***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nIn the following sections, the Tribunal will summarize Respondent's *ratione personae* objection to jurisdiction [**1.**], followed by Claimants' position [**2.**], and finally make its decision [**3.**].\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Claimant 1 (Pawlowski AG), because Pawlowski AG does not qualify as a protected investor under Article 1(1) of the BIT.161 Respondent does not raise objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Claimant 2 (Projekt Sever).\n\nR-PHB, para. 132; R-II, 3.2; R-I, 3.2.\n\n173.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Pawlowski AG does not qualify as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, because it has neither real economic activities, nor its seat, in Switzerland [**1.1**],162 and it is not protected under Article 1(1)(c), because an investor that fails to qualify under Article 1(1)(b) cannot requalify as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(c) [**1.2**].163\n\nR-PHB, para. 133.\n\nR-PHB, para. 136.\n\n**1.1 P****awlowski** **AG** **is not a protected investor under** **A****rticle** **1(1)(****b****)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT requires a protected investor to demonstrate that it has \"real economic activities\" in Switzerland [**A.**] and that it has its \"seat\" in Switzerland [**B.**].164\n\nR-PHB, para. 133.\n\nA. **Pawlowski AG does not carry out \"real economic activities\" in Switzerland**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nRespondent argues that Pawlowski AG is an \"investment holding company\",165 that does not carry out real economic activities, and that it is only Pawlowski AG's subsidiaries that carry out such activities.166\n\nR-PHB, para. 134, referring to Claimants\u2019 Opening Statement, **H-1**, p. 4.\n\nR-PHB, para. 134.\n\n176.\n\nRespondent refers to a \"seven-prong\" test, set forth by the *Alps Finance* tribunal, to assess whether an investor meets the requirements of \"real economic activities.\"167 It is the Respondent's view that Pawlowski AG cannot satisfy this test.\n\nR-II, para. 243, referring to *Alps Finance,* **RL-18**, paras. 219-223.\n\n177.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant 1 relies not on its own economic activities, but on the activities of an entirely different company, Dmura AG, for the alleged economic activities of Pawlowski AG.168\n\nR-II, para. 243.\n\nB. **Claimants have not established a Swiss \"seat\" for Pawlowski AG**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nWith respect to the company\u2019s \"seat\", Respondent argues that a company\u2019s \"seat\" must be interpreted as the effective place of management and administration of its business operations. Respondent notes that this was the definition adopted by the *Alps Finance* tribunal - which is the only other tribunal to have been constituted under the BIT and called upon to apply Article 1(1)(c).169\n\nR-PHB, para. 135, referring to *Alps Finance,* **RL-18**, para. 217.\n\n179.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Mr. Pawlowski was unable to identify a \"given Swiss place\" from which the company was managed and administered.170 Respondent notes that Mr. Pawlowski identified the seat of another company, Dmura AG, which is located in Zuoz, Switzerland, as the place where he usually works. Additionally, Respondent notes that Pawlowski AG has its registered offices in the care of an investment fund, Quadris AG, which is where Pawlowski AG has its registered place of business as well as available office space.171\n\nR-PHB, para. 135.\n\nR-PHB, para. 135, referring to HT 194, 196.\n\n**1.2 P****awlowski** **AG** **is not a protected investor under** **A****rticle** **1(1)(****c****)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nRespondent argues that Article 1(1)(c) is not intended to cover companies, which, while registered in Switzerland, fail to pass the test of Article 1(1)(b).172 Thus, according to Respondent, because Pawlowski AG is not a protected investor under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, it cannot requalify as an investor under Article 1(1)(c).173\n\nR-PHB, para. 136; HT 126.\n\nR-PHB, para. 136.\n\n181.\n\nRespondent argues that Article 1(1)(c) cannot be read in isolation, because such a reading would render meaningless the restrictions of Article 1(1)(b) in contravention of the principle of *effet utile.*174 Respondent notes the *Alps Finance* finding that Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT is a \"special and uncommon clause\", included specifically \"to exclude from treaty protection 'mailbox\u2019 or 'paper\u2019 companies.\" According to Respondent, Pawlowski AG is such a company.175\n\nR-II, para. 247.\n\nR-II, para. 249, referring to *Alps Finance,* **RL-18**, para. 224.\n\n182.\n\nAdditionally, according to Respondent, Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT only covers two types of companies:\n\n- those which are Czech-registered but ultimately Swiss-controlled, and\n\n- those which are registered in any country outside of the two Contracting Parties, yet are ultimately Swiss-controlled (Respondent notes that the reverse would be true in the case of a claim brought against Switzerland).176\n\nR-II, para. 246.\n\n183.\n\nSince Pawlowski AG is neither Czech-registered but ultimately Swiss-controlled, nor registered in a third country but Swiss-controlled, it cannot be considered an investor under Article 1(1)(c).177\n\nR-II, fn. 359.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s *ratione personae* jurisdiction objections.

Claimants explain that Pawlowski AG acts as an investment holding company, and thus does not have direct operational responsibilities and does not require large offices and staff - but that this does not mean that Pawlowski AG is not engaged in real economic activities in Switzerland.184\n\nC-III, para. 53.\n\n190.\n\nClaimants note that it is in the nature of holding companies to conduct business through their subsidiaries. Claimants also note that Respondent does not refute that Dmura AG is Pawlowski AG's subsidiary, or that Pawlowski AG is a substantial shareholder of Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz. According to Claimants, Pawlowski AG brings benefit to the Swiss economy through its daughter company and through its holding in Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz.185\n\nC-III, para. 56.\n\n191.\n\nClaimants explain that Pawlowski AG has more than a modest turnover, pays substantial fees for various legal and bookkeeping services, and has handled payments and contributions via its Swiss bank accounts, including the payment of remuneration to former board members.186\n\nC-III, para. 57, referring to C-II, para. 63, and *Alps Finance,* **RL-18**, paras. 219, 223.\n\n192.\n\nClaimants additionally note that accepting Respondent's interpretation would lead to the untenable result of excluding holding companies from the BIT's protection entirely, and that this result would contradict both the purpose of the BIT as well as jurisprudence and doctrine.187\n\nC-III, para. 59; C-II, para. 52, referring to *Tenaris,* **CL-91**, para. 199.\n\nB. **Pawlowski AG has its \"seat\" in Switzerland**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Swiss statutory seat of Pawlowski AG is sufficient to fulfill the BIT's requirement of a seat in Switzerland.188 Claimants refer to case law for the proposition that a company's seat shall be interpreted by way of *renvoi* to municipal law.189 Claimants assert that, pursuant to Article 56 of the Swiss Civil Code, the seat of a legal entity is located where its administration is carried out, unless its articles of association provide otherwise.190\n\nC-III, para. 41; C-PHB, para 8, referring to *Mera,* **CL-85**, para 89; *Barcelona Traction,* **CL-87**, para. 38; *Wirtgen,* **RL-20**, para. 215.\n\nC-II, para. 38, referring to *Mera,* **CL-85**, para. 89.\n\nC-II, para. 39, referring to Swiss Civil Code, Article 56, **CL-88**.\n\n194.\n\nClaimants explain that Pawlowski AG\u2019s articles of association name Zug, Switzerland, as its seat.191 Claimants also explain that, according to the Swiss Private International Law Act, the seat of a company is the place specified in the articles of association or the partnership agreement.192 Finally, Claimants note that the Zug Commercial Registry lists Zug as the seat of Pawlowski AG.193\n\nC-II, para. 39, referring to Pawlowski AG Articles of Association, Article 1, **C-106**.\n\nC-II, para. 39, referring to Swiss Private International Law Act, Article 21, **CL-89**.\n\nC-II, para. 39, referring to Swiss Commercial Registry for Pawlowski AG, **C-3**.\n\n195.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the BIT is wrong.\n\n196.\n\nClaimants note that Respondent relies upon the *Wirtgen* tribunal in support of the proposition that the definitions contained in Article 1 are meant to be autonomous and treaty-specific, and hence, according to Respondent, \"seat\" should be read in accordance with international law rather than Swiss law.194 However, according to Claimants, the *Wirtgen* position is not that a term such as \"seat\" should be interpreted in accordance with international law; rather, the *Wirtgen* tribunal explained that when it appears that the contracting parties did not wish to give a term a particular meaning which it may have in national law, then a treaty term may be interpreted independently from the national law of the parties. Claimants assert that in the present case there is no indication that the Contracting Parties did not wish tribunals to consider national law in interpreting the BITs terms.195\n\nC-III, para. 44, referring to R-II, para. 239.\n\nC-III, para. 46.\n\n197.\n\nClaimants note that, as a practical matter, it does not make a difference whether the Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 or Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the interpretation of the term \"seat\" in the BIT. According to Claimants, even if Respondent\u2019s interpretation of \"seat\" (meaning the effective place of management and administration of a company) were correct *(quod non),* Claimants have submitted evidence sufficient to demonstrate that Pawlowski AG is effectively managed and administered in Zug and Zuoz, Switzerland, notably that:196\n\n- The general meetings of shareholders are held in Switzerland;\n\n- Corporate and accounting records are maintained in Switzerland;\n\n- All administrative services, including bookkeeping and accounting, have been provided in Switzerland;\n\n- At all material times, an active bank account has been maintained, and is still maintained, in Switzerland;\n\n- The office in Zug is the only office worldwide, with substantive administrative work being done in Zuoz; and\n\n- The auditors have always been companies with their seat in Switzerland.\n\nC-III, para. 42; C-II, paras. 50 *et seq.*\n\n**2.2 P****awlowski** **AG** **also qualifies as an investor under** **A****rticle** **1(1)(****c****)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nClaimants argue that, regardless of the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, Pawlowski AG separately and independently qualifies as an investor under the BIT under Article 1(1)(c), because Pawlowski AG is 100% owned and controlled by a Swiss national, Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski.197\n\nC-III, paras. 61, 79.\n\n199.\n\nClaimants explain that Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT applies to two types of potential investors:\n\n- legal entities that are controlled by Swiss nationals, and\n\n- legal entities that are controlled by Swiss entities that also have real economic activities in Switzerland.198\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Pawlowski AG in the present case by virtue of Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s citizenship as a Swiss national and his ultimate control of Pawlowski AG.199\n\nC-II, para. 22.\n\nC-III, para. 64.\n\n200.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s argument that Article 1(1)(c) only applies to Swiss-controlled companies registered either in the Czech Republic or in any country other than Switzerland or the Czech Republic. According to Claimants, this argument goes against the terms of the BIT, particularly since the text of Article 1(1)(c) states that it applies to \"legal entities established under the law of **any** country.\"200\n\nC-III, para. 66, referring to BIT Article 1(1)(c) [emphasis added by Claimants].\n\n201.\n\nClaimants additionally reject Respondent\u2019s argument that granting jurisdiction under Article 1(1)(c) would be in contravention of the principle of *effet utile*. According to Claimants, the principle of *effet utile* aims to make the object and purpose of the BIT possible or effectuated through interpretation. Claimants explain that the object and purpose of the BIT is, *inter alia,* to \"create and maintain favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\" Thus, in order to qualify as an \"investor of one Contracting Party\", Pawlowski AG is required to show a sufficient link to Switzerland. According to Claimants, by including both Article 1(1)(b) and Article 1(1)(c) in the BIT, it follows that the Contracting Parties deemed these to be different links, satisfaction of either one of which is sufficient to secure qualification as a protected investor.201\n\nC-III, para. 70.\n\n202.\n\nThus, according to Claimants, Pawlowski AG qualifies as an investor either if it\n\n- has its seat, together with real economic activities in Switzerland (under Article 1(1)(b))\n\n- or alternatively, if, in conformity with Article 1(1)(c), it is controlled by a Swiss national (under Article 1(2)(c)).\n\nClaimants' position is that Pawlowski AG has demonstrated sufficient links to Switzerland to satisfy the conditions to qualify as an investor under both possible avenues.202\n\nC-III, para. 71.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Pawlowski AG does not fulfil the requirements under Article 1(1) of the BIT and therefore does not qualify as a protected investor under the BIT. Specifically, Respondent asserts that:\n\n- Pawlowski AG does not qualify under Article 1(1)(b), because it has not established that it has real economic activities and its \"seat\" in Switzerland; and\n\n- Pawlowski AG cannot requalify under Article 1(1)(c), because this clause is not intended to apply to investors who otherwise fail to meet the requirements under Article 1(1)(b).\n\n204.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Pawlowski AG qualifies as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(b) and, separately, under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT.203\n\nC-III, paras. 37-79.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties with respect to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Projekt Sever. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will quickly go over the facts pertinent to its jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Projekt Sever.\n\n206.\n\nClaimants have shown that:\n\n- Projekt Sever is a company established in 2007 under the laws of the Czech Republic, registered with the Municipal Court in Prague under Company ID No. 278 61 503204;\n\n- 100% of the shares of Projekt Sever have been held by Pawlowski AG at all times relevant to this dispute205; and\n\n- Pawlowski AG is a Swiss established company206 fully owned and controlled by Mr. Pawlowski - himself a Swiss Citizen.207\n\nExcerpt of Municipal Court Registry for Projekt Sever s.r.o.

(printed on 9 June 2016), **C-5**.\n\nPawlowski AG Articles of Association, **C-106**.\n\nPassport of Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, **C-14**.\n\n207.\n\nArticle 1(1)(c) of the BIT provides protection to investors, who are defined as:\n\n\"legal entities established under the law of any country which are, directly or indirectly, controlled by nationals of that Contracting Party or by legal entities having their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of that Contracting Party.\"\n\n208.\n\nProjekt Sever is a legal entity established under the law of the Czech Republic. Projekt Sever also fulfills the additional requirements for protection under Article 1 (1)(c): it is a legal entity which is (i) controlled directly by the Swiss company Pawlowski AG through its 100% share ownership, and (ii) controlled indirectly by Mr. Pawlowski, who is a national of Switzerland.\n\n209.\n\nThus, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Projekt Sever.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to Respondent\u2019s objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Pawlowski AG. The Tribunal will begin by establishing the facts [**A.**] and will then explain why it dismisses Respondent\u2019s objection [**B.**].\n\nA. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n211.\n\nAs previously noted, Pawlowski AG is fully owned and controlled by Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, who is a Swiss citizen.208\n\nPawlowski AG Articles of Association, **C-106**; Passport of Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, **C-14**.\n\n212.\n\nPawlowski AG is a company which was incorporated under the laws of Switzerland on 20 September 1996.209 Pawlowski AG\u2019s Articles of Association establish that its seat is in Zug and that:\n\n\"The purpose of the company is to acquire and manage all types of investments in domestic and foreign companies.\n\nThe company may acquire, hold and dispose of real estate and engage in all commercial, financial and other activities related to the purpose of the company.\"210\n\nExcerpt of Swiss Commercial Registry for Pawlowski AG (printed on 17 March 2017), **C-3**.\n\nPawlowski AG Articles of Association, Article 2, **C-106**.\n\n213.\n\nPawlowski AG\u2019s activities are consistent with the above. It acts primarily as a holding company, which, through its subsidiaries, owns and controls investments in Switzerland and abroad, *inter alia*:\n\n- Besides its ownership and control of Projekt Sever, Pawlowski AG also owns 100% of the shares of the Swiss company Dmura AG;211\n\n- Dmura AG, in turn, runs the Swiss hotels Parkh\u00fctte Varusch,212 Hotel Engiadina,213 and Hotel Crusch Alva,214 all of which employ significant numbers of personnel;215\n\n- Dmura AG is also active in the real estate business in Switzerland, having engaged in the construction and sale of apartment buildings, especially in the Canton of Graubunden;216\n\n- Pawlowski AG has also directly invested in the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz, a well-known Swiss international boarding school, where Mr. Pawlowski serves as the chairman of the board of directors.217\n\nShare Purchase Agreement (Dmura AG), 31 December 2008, **C-110**, Letter from Credit Suisse AG for Pawlowski AG re Securities Receipt Notification, 3 March 2009, **C-111**; Excerpt of Commercial Register (Dmura AG), 27 June 2019, **C-112**.\n\nExtract from Website of Parkh\u00fctte Varusch, 22 June 2019, **C-113**.\n\nExtract from Website of Hotel Engiadina, 22 June 2019, **C-114**; Department of Food Safety Inspection Report (Hotel Engiadina), 22 September 2016, **C-115**.\n\nExtract from Website of Hotel Crusch Alva, 3 July 2019, **C-116**; Department of Food Safety Inspection Report (Hotel Crush Alva), 15 April 2019, **C-117**.\n\nLetter from AXA Winterthur to Hotel Engiadina regarding Final Premium statement UVG (AXA), 9 April 2008, **C-119**, (Insurance for Employees); Letter from Hotela Foundation to Dmura AG regarding Final Account Year 2009, 6 May 2010, **C-120**; Letter from Municipal Tax Office of Zouz to Dmura AG regarding Account of Withholding Tax, 14 December 2009, **C-121**.\n\nSee *e.g.*, Contract of Sale regarding Condominium ownership, 29 October 2010, **C-122**; Letter from Municipality Zuoz to Dmura AG re Final Account, 15 August 2014, **C-123**.\n\nLetter from Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz AG to Pawlowski AG regarding Share Certificate of Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz, 2 February 2005, **C-124**; Excerpt of Commercial Register (Lyceum Alpinum), 22 June 2019, **C-125**.\n\nB. **Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n214.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT explains that:\n\n\"(1) In the case of either Contracting Party, the term \"investor\" refers to:\n\n(a) natural persons who are nationals of that Contracting Party in accordance with its laws;\n\n(b) legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organisations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of the same Contracting Party;\n\n(c) legal entities established under the law of any country which are, directly or indirectly, controlled by nationals of that Contracting Party or by legal entities having their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of that Contracting Party.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n215.\n\nRespondent argues that Pawlowski AG cannot qualify as an investor under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT, because this provision is not intended to extend to companies registered in Switzerland which fail to pass the test of Article 1(1)(b).218\n\nR-PHB, para. 136; HT 126.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree.\n\n217.\n\nUnder the rules of interpretation set forth in Article 31 of the VCLT:\n\n\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"219\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May1969, **CL-72**.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see any language in the text of Article 1(1) of the BIT which suggests that a failure to qualify under one clause would prohibit qualification under the other. Thus, the Tribunal finds that Pawlowski AG may qualify as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(c) independently of the requirements of Article 1(1)(b).\n\nArticle 1(1)(c)\n---------------\n\n219.\n\nTwo elements are required for Pawlowski AG to qualify as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT:\n\n- First, it must be a legal entity established under the law of Switzerland; and\n\n- Second, it must be controlled, directly or indirectly, by: (i) nationals of Switzerland, or (ii) legal entities which are seated and have real economic activities in Switzerland.\n\n220.\n\nIt has already been shown that Pawlowski AG was incorporated under the laws of Switzerland in 1996,220 satisfying the first requirement.\n\nExcerpt of Swiss Commercial Registry for Pawlowski AG (printed on 17 March 2017), **C-3**.\n\n221.\n\nIt has also been established that Pawlowski AG is fully owned and controlled by a Swiss national, Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski,221 meeting the second requirement.\n\nPawlowski AG Share Register, **C-13**; Passport of Mr. Sebastian Pawlowski, **C-14**.\n\n222.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to Pawlowski AG under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n223.\n\nHaving determined that Pawlowski AG qualifies as a protected investor under Article 1(1)(c), the Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s objections with respect to Article 1(1)(b) are moot.\n\n**VI.2.** **JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE MATERIAE***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nClaimants submit that they made investments under the BIT and the ICSID Convention by undertaking several interrelated economic activities which lead to the implementation of a project. In particular:\n\n- Pawlowski AG invested in all the shares and capital of Projekt Sever;\n\n- Projekt Sever, in turn, invested in 276,134 m2 of real property in Prague in order to construct the Project; and\n\n- Projekt Sever also invested capital in the planning process of the Project.\n\n225.\n\nIn the following sections the Tribunal will summarize Respondent's *ratione materiae* objection to jurisdiction [**1.**], followed by Claimants' position [**2.**], and finally make its decision [**3.**].\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nRespondent argues that, under the BIT and under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, a protected investment involves contribution, duration and risk. According to Respondent, the Claimants' submissions focused solely on the criterion of contribution and they have thus failed to prove that their investments meet all of these criteria.222 Respondent presents *ratione materiae* objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the investments of both Pawlowski AG (Claimant 1) [**1.1**] and Projekt Sever (Claimant 2) [**1.2**].\n\nR-PHB, paras. 130-131.\n\n**1.1 P****awlowski** **AG\u2019****s shareholding is not a protected investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nRespondent notes that Pawlowski AG\u2019s investment consists solely of its shares in, and payment for those shares to, Projekt Sever. Respondent argues that this shareholding is insufficient to qualify as a protected investment, because Claimants paid only an admittedly nominal price of CZK 200,000 for the shares in Projekt Sever.223 According to Respondent, the payment of a purely nominal price for shares puts in doubt the existence of a contribution and, in turn, that of a protected investment.224 Furthermore, Respondent argues that Pawlowski AG cannot possibly hold a protected investment, since it only holds shares in Projekt Sever, which itself does not hold a protected investment.225\n\nR-II, para. 227, referring to C-II, para. 75.\n\nR-II, para. 227, referring to *Phoenix Action,* **RL-5,** para. 119; *Caratube,* **RL-31**, para. 435; *Saba Fakes,* **RL-32**, para. 139.\n\nR-II, para. 228.\n\n**1.2 P****rojekt** **S****ever****\u2019****s alleged investments are not protected**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nAccording to Respondent, none of the three components of Projekt Sever's alleged investment is protected, namely:\n\n- the purchase of land;\n\n- the capital spent on the planning process; or\n\n- the expectation that the Project would finally be implemented.226\n\nR-II, para. 229.\n\n229.\n\nRespondent argues that Projekt Sever's purchase of land is a one-off commercial transaction, devoid of any risk and duration, which thus does not fulfil the inherent criteria of a protected investment.227 Respondent also argues that, because the Claimants' project never materialised, any pre-investment expenditures or capital spent on the planning process cannot form a part of a protected investment.228 Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to prove that Projekt Sever's investment can consist of the expectation that the Project would finally be implemented - an impossible task, since such expectation does not fulfil the criteria of contribution, duration and risk.229\n\nR-II, para. 230, referring to *Joy Mining,* **RL-21**, paras. 54-58; *Romak,* **RL-17**, paras. 178-188; *Global Trading,* **RL-9**, paras. 55-57.\n\nR-II, para. 233.\n\nR-I, para. 184; R-II, para. 233.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nClaimants dismiss Respondent's objections with respect to both Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever. As a preliminary matter, Claimants note that Respondent does not contest that Pawlowski AG's investments (its purchase of the shares in Projekt Sever, its capital contributions to Projekt Sever, Projekt Sever's purchase of the real estate at issue, and the costs incurred by Projekt Sever in connection with the planning and development of Residential Complex Benice) would not have come about but for Claimants' decision to develop and dedicate Projekt Sever's resources to the Project. According to Claimants, this by itself is sufficient to establish the existence of a protected investment.230\n\nC-III, para. 10.\n\n231.\n\nClaimants have presented submissions arguing that both Pawlowski AG [**2.1**] and Projekt Sever [**2.2**] made protected investments as defined in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and in the BIT.231\n\nC-PHB, para. 9.\n\n**2.1 P****awlowski** **AG** **made protected investments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nClaimants note that it is not in dispute that Pawlowski AG purchased 100% of the shares of Projekt Sever for CZK 200,000.232 According to Claimants, this alone qualifies as an investment by Pawlowski AG under Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, regardless of the amount paid for such shares.233 Claimants note that Pawlowski AG also made additional capital contributions and loans to Projekt Sever totaling CZK 649,027,000 as of 31 December 2018.234\n\nExcerpt of Municipal Court Registry for Projekt Sever s.r.o.

Thus, in the Claimants view, all costs incurred from the moment of the first land purchase were investments in a development project that commenced with that land purchase.240\n\nC-PHB, para. 11, referring to Agreement on Design Work and Engineering Activities between Projekt Sever and TaK, 23 December 2007, **C-50**; Letter from PVS confirming construction of wastewater pumping station, 7 May 2014, **C-208**; Various Invoices to Projekt Sever from 2007 to 2017, **C-132**.\n\nC-PHB, para. 11.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether the investments made by Claimants qualify as \"protected investments\" under the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n237.\n\nClaimants rely on the following investments:\n\n- Pawlowski AG\u2019s invested CZK 200,000.00 in purchasing its 100% shareholding in Projekt Sever;\n\n- Pawlowski AG made capital contributions and loans to Projekt Sever for the purpose of purchasing the land for development of the Project;\n\n- Projekt Sever invested CZK 343,693,031.00 in its purchase of 276,134 m2 of real estate in Prague;241 and\n\n- Projekt Sever invested additional capital in the planning and designing of the Project.\n\nC-I, para. 237.\n\nA. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n238.\n\nClaimants have provided evidence that Pawlowski AG paid CZK 200,000 for its 100% share ownership of Projekt Sever.\n\n239.\n\nThe contract concerning the assignment of Projekt Sever\u2019s shares declares that:242\n\n\"The seller paid his contribution of CZK 200,000,- to the company\u2019s nominal capital in full. His share, which is determined by the ratio of his contribution to the company\u2019s nominal capital, is 100%.\n\n[...]\n\nThe seller assigns its entire share in the above-mentioned Company, corresponding to a contribution of CZK 200,000,-, to the Buyer [identified as Pawlowski AG].\n\n[...]\n\nThe seller assigns its company share at a price of CZK 200,000,- (in words: two hundred thousand Czech crowns).\"\n\nContract concerning the Assignment of a Company share (Projekt Sever), 21 February 2007, **C-131**.\n\n240.\n\nThe extract from the Commercial Register of the Municipal Court in Prague lists Pawlowski AG as the sole shareholder of Projekt Sever, showing a 100% paid contribution of CZK 200,000 equating to a 100% business share in Projekt Sever.243\n\nExcerpt of Municipal Court Registry for Projekt Sever, **C-5**.\n\n241.\n\nDocumentary evidence submitted by Claimants shows that Pawlowski AG provided significant funding to Projekt Sever, including (as of 31 December 2018):\n\n- Equity contributions totaling CZK 414,707,000;244\n\n- Loans totaling CZK 649,027,000.245\n\nFinancial statements of Projekt Sever for the Year 2018, Balance Sheets, Payables to Partners, **AP-117**.\n\nFinancial statements of Projekt Sever for the Year 2018, Balance Sheets, Payables to Partners, **AP-117**; Loan Contract between Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever, 16 February 2007, **C-127**; Addendum 1 to Loan Contract between Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever, 29 December 2013, **C-128**; Financial statements of Projekt Sever for the Years 2007 to 2017, Balance Sheets, Liabilities to Partners and Participants in an Association - Payables to Partners, **AP-74**; Financial statements of Projekt Sever for the Year 2018, Balance Sheets, Payables to Partners, **AP-117**; Bank statements of Projekt Sever from 2008 to 2016, **C-133** (Contributions); Capital Contribution from Pawlowski AG to Projekt Sever (Bank statement), 26 June 2007, **C-134**.\n\n242.\n\nWith respect to Projekt Sever's alleged investments, it is undisputed that Projekt Sever purchased the land for the Project from private landowners, the City of Prague and the Czech Republic's Ministry of Defense.246\n\nColler WS I, para. 16; Zugar WS, paras. 11-14; Purchase Contract with Ministry of Defense, 8 December 2008, **C-31**; Purchase Agreement between Prague 22 district Uhrin\u00e8ves and Projekt Sever, 20 June 2007, **C-26**.\n\nB. **Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n243.\n\nArticle 1(2) of BIT provides the following definition of \"investments\":\n\n\"The term \"investments\" shall include every kind of assets and particularly:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as servitudes, mortgages, liens, pledges;\n\n(b) shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in companies;\n\n(c) claims and rights to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, utility models, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, indications of origin), know-how and goodwill;\n\n(e) concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n244.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting state (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting state designated to the Centre by that state) and a national of another Contracting state, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal will assess the investments of each Claimant in turn.\n\nPawlowski AG\u2019s investments\n--------------------------\n\n246.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the BIT makes clear that \"investments\" includes \"shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in companies.\"\n\n247.\n\nIt has already been established that Pawlowski AG paid the sum of CZK 200,000.00 for its 100% shareholding in Projekt Sever. There is therefore nothing to cause the Tribunal to doubt that Pawlowski AG\u2019s shareholding in Projekt Sever qualifies as a protected investment.\n\n248.\n\nPawlowski AG also indirectly invested in the Project through its equity contributions to Projekt Sever.\n\n249.\n\nWith respect to the question of whether loans and other equity contributions could be considered an investment, the tribunal in *Standard Chartered* noted that:\n\n\"The Tribunal accepts that loans and financial instruments standing alone without any link to some economic venture intended to provide for the improvement of the State\u2019s development would not be considered an *'investment \u2019*.\"247\n\n*Standard Chartered,* **CL-111**, para. 220.\n\n250.\n\nHowever, the *Standard Chartered* tribunal also noted that it had no doubt that such loans, when made in the context of financing the construction and operation of a facility, clearly carried inherent investment risks, thus satisfying the requirement of \"investment risk\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. As noted by the tribunal in *Standard Chartered,* this finding has been confirmed by numerous other tribunals.248\n\n*Standard Chartered,* **CL-111**, para. 221 (itself referring to *Fedax N. V. v. Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997; *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. Slovak Republic.* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999; *MNSS B. V. and Recupero Credito Acciaio N. V. v. Montenegro,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/8, Award, 4 May 2016).\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the loans and contributions extended by Pawlowski AG to Projekt Sever were analogous to those contemplated by the *Standard Chartered* tribunal, as they were made for the direct purpose of financing the purchase and development of the Project.\n\n252.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that Pawlowski AG\u2019s loans and equity contributions, made to Projekt Sever to support the purchase of land and the development of the Project, also qualify as protected investments under the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nProjekt Sever\u2019s investments\n---------------------------\n\n253.\n\nProjekt Sever\u2019s alleged investments include its direct investments in the purchase of land for the Project, and its direct investment in designing and planning the Project, as well as associated costs.\n\n254.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the BIT states explicitly that \"investments\" shall include \"movable and immovable property.\"\n\n255.\n\nProjekt Sever\u2019s purchases of land for the purpose of realising the construction of a residential development has been well established. These land purchases clearly fall within the meaning of \"investments\" provided by the BIT.\n\n256.\n\nProjekt Sever\u2019s expenditures in connection with the design and planning of the Project have likewise been established, and the Tribunal considers that these expenditures also qualify under the terms of the BIT, as they constitute \"claims and rights to any performance having an economic value.\"\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the purchase of land is a perfectly legitimate first step in an incremental investment intended to be realised in a multi-unit development. Indeed, Projekt Sever's further expenditures towards the design and planning of the Project prove that they were not \"one-off commercial transactions\", but rather a series of distinct expenditures all made for the purpose of realising the development of the Project.\n\n258.\n\nIn this case, Pawlowski AG assumed the legal and financial risk of being the 100% shareholder of the Czech company Projekt Sever. Pawlowski AG then contributed capital in the form of equity and loans extended to Projekt Sever in order to enable it to carry out entrepreneurial activity in the Czech Republic - consisting in the purchase of land for, and the design and planned development of, the residential project in Benice. The Tribunal thus finds that Respondent\u2019s *ratione materiae* objections are inapposite; however \"investment\" is defined, there is no question that foreign direct investment, where the foreign investor directly owns and manages an enterprise situated in the host country, and where said enterprise carries out entrepreneurial activities in the host country, qualifies as such.249\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nSee *e.g.*, *OIEuropean,* **RL-64**, para. 224; *Edenred,* para. 177.\n\n259.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal finds that\n\n- Pawlowski AG\u2019s shareholding in, and its equity contributions to, Projekt Sever, and\n\n- Projekt Sever\u2019s land purchases and expenditure towards the design and development of the Project,\n\neach qualify as protected investments under the BIT.\n\n260.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent\u2019s *ratione materiae* objection.\n\n**VI.3.** **DOMESTIC LAW OBJECTION**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 claims are inadmissible, because they are purely domestic claims involving Czech urban planning law, over which the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.250\n\nR-PHB, para. 137; R-II, para 263, referring to *Generation Ukraine,* **RL-45****.**\n\n262.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent argues that Claimants have merely listed several Treaty standards that they say were breached, and that they have not clarified which act or omission of the Czech Republic, if proven, could constitute a breach of the BIT, nor have they established any actual interrelationship between their domestic claims and Treaty claims.251\n\nR-PHB, para. 140.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s objection to admissibility and aver that their claims are for violations of the BIT. According to Claimants, Czech domestic law provides relevant factual context, but Claimants\u2019 claims do not depend on proving any violation of Czech law.252\n\nC-PHB, para. 15.\n\n264.\n\nClaimants refute the relevance of the case law cited by Respondent, noting that the *Generation Ukraine* tribunal, in coming to the conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction, found that the claimant in that case had raised no international law claims.253\n\nC-III, para. 83, referring to *Generation Ukraine,* **RL-45**, paras. 8.9-8.12.\n\n265.\n\nClaimants assert that in the present case it is obvious from reading Claimants\u2019 submissions on the merits that their claims are for violations of the BIT, not for violations of domestic Czech law.254 Claimants explain that this case does not turn on the question of whether the district of Benice was required under Czech law to refrain from filing a lawsuit to challenge the re-zoning of the Project Area to residential, or whether the Prague City Assembly was required under Czech law to restore the zoning plan change after it had been annulled by the Czech courts. Rather, according to Claimants, the relevant question pertinent to the claims in this arbitration is whether Respondent\u2019s treatment of Claimants violated international law, and, in particular, the BIT.255\n\nC-III, para. 84.\n\nC-II, para. 383.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nClaimants have made several claims under the BIT. Specifically, Claimants allege that:\n\n- Respondent has violated the BIT's Article 4 obligations, including the requirements to provide fair and equitable treatment, to refrain from unreasonable, arbitrary and bad faith measures, and to refrain from discriminatory and less favorable treatment;\n\n- Respondent has breached its obligation pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT to \"provide the necessary permits\" in connection with Claimants' investment; and\n\n- Respondent's actions resulted in an indirect expropriation of Claimants' investment, in violation of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, while several of Claimants' arguments refer to Czech domestic law, such references are made in order to provide context for Claimants' claims under the BIT. This conclusion is consistent with the finding in *Binder,* where the tribunal noted that:\n\n\"390. The BIT is an international treaty and should be interpreted in accordance with the principles of international treaty law, as codified in the Geneva Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Arbitral Tribunal derives its competence exclusively from the BIT and is not competent to decide how Czech law ls to be interpreted, this being a matter for the Czech courts. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot review the interpretation of domestic law in Czech court decisions. Nor can the Tribunal express an opinion on the interpretation of Czech law on matters which have not been decided by Czech courts.\n\n391. However, in this arbitration Czech law is one of the factual elements which the Tribunal must take into account when establishing whether the Czech Republic has observed its undertakings in the Czech-German BIT. It is the Tribunal's task to examine whether Czech Law, as it was applied to the Claimant and his company CARGO, may have violated the obligations of the Czech Republic in the BIT. In other words, if it should be found that Czech law had such contents, or was applied in such manner, as to violate any of these treaty obligations, the Tribunal is competent to establish that a violation occurred and to draw the legal conclusions following from it. The Tribunal's examination may not only concern specific acts by the Czech authorities but also extend to general questions of whether the Czech legal system, including the availability of judicial and administrative remedies, was sufficient to provide the Claimant with adequate protection for his investment in the Czech Republic.\"256 [Emphasis added]\n\n*Binder,* **CL-119**, paras. 390-391.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have any doubt that Claimants' claims arise under the BIT. Indeed, each of Claimants' claims requires the Tribunal to determine whether Respondent has violated the BIT with respect to Claimant's protected investments.\n\n269.\n\nWhile the Tribunal may have to undertake an examination of Czech Law or the Czech legal framework, such analysis is only undertaken in order to enable the Tribunal to make determinations as to the merits of Claimants' international law claims arising under the BIT.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses Respondent\u2019s domestic law objection.\n\n**VII.** **Merits**\n-------------------\n\n271.\n\nHaving determined that it has jurisdiction, the Tribunal now turns to the merits and to Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Czech Republic\u2019s conduct towards their investments was in breach of Articles 3, 4, and 6 of the BIT.\n\n272.\n\nClaimants make four general points with respect to the merits:\n\n273.\n\nFirst, Claimants ask that the Tribunal consider the Preamble of the BIT, which records the Contracting States\u2019 desire \"to intensify economic cooperation\" and \"to promote and protect foreign investments\" as well as their desire to \"create and maintain favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"257\n\nC-PHB, para. 18; BIT, p. 1.\n\n274.\n\nSecond, Claimants note that they are not required to prove fault in the sense of intention to harm. Claimants quote *Mondev,* which found that \"it is only the act of a state that matters, independently of any intention.\"258\n\nC-PHB, para. 19, referring to ILC Articles, **CL-5**, Article 2, Commentary, para. 10. See also *Mondev,* **CL-13**, para. 116.\n\n275.\n\nThird, Claimants argue that a violation of a treaty obligation is not excused by the fact that the acts in question may have complied with the internal laws of the state.259\n\nC-PHB, para. 20, referring to ILC Articles, **CL-5**, Article 3 and Commentary; also Article 32 (re the lack of relevance of internal law); *Watkins Holdings,* **CL-112**, para. 505 (local law \"should not be used as a tool to override [a state's] international obligations\"); *Hopkins v. Mexico* (1926), cited in *S.D. Myers,* **CL-49**, paras. 259-261; *CME,* **CL-25**, para. 611; *Flemingo DutyFree,* **CL-37**, para. 531; C. Schreuer and R. Dolzer, *Principles of International Investment Law,* Oxford University Press 2012, **CL-50**, p. 133.\n\n276.\n\nFourth, Claimants argue that the Tribunal does not need to decide whether each of Benice\u2019s and the City of Prague\u2019s individual actions was wrongful; the events should be considered \"cumulatively in context to each other,\"260 with the ultimate question being whether the cumulative effect of Respondent\u2019s actions amounts to a violation of the BIT.261\n\nC-PHB, para. 21, referring to *Stati,* **RL-130**, para. 1095.\n\nC-PHB, para. 21, referring to *Rompetrol,* **RL-40**, para. 271.\n\n277.\n\nRespondent rejects all of the claims, arguing that Claimants not only misconstrue the legal standards applicable to Articles 3, 4, and 6 of the BIT, but also that they fail to demonstrate facts that could amount to a treaty violation; the claims, it says, are nothing more than alleged breaches of Czech domestic law.\n\n278.\n\nFirst, according to Respondent, it is a foundational principle of international law that its norms are separate and distinct from those of domestic law. A breach of domestic law does not, therefore, automatically amount to a breach international law.262\n\nR-I, paras. 244-245.\n\n279.\n\nSecond, Respondent explains that Claimants' claims centre around the Municipal Court of Prague's and the Supreme Administrative Court's annulment of the Zoning Plan Change and the City of Prague's subsequent failure to override those court judgments. Claimants are only submitting breaches of domestic law and they have failed to include arguments that could convert their claims into breaches of international law.263\n\nR-I, para. 252.\n\n280.\n\nThird, Respondent argues that, even if the Tribunal were to find that Claimants presented international law claims, the Czech Republic did not violate Articles 3, 4, or 6 of the BIT.264\n\nR-I, paras. 265-266.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by analysing whether the Czech Republic has breached Article 4 of the BIT [**VII.1**], Claimant's main claim, and it will devote separate sections to the two ancillary claims submitted: the breach of the obligation to grant the necessary permits under Article 3 [**VII.2**] and the breach of the prohibition to expropriate under Article 6 [**VII.3**].\n\n**VII.1. BREACH OF ARTICLE 4 OF THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nClaimants\u2019 principal claim is that the Czech Republic breached its duty to guarantee \"fair and equitable treatment\" (\"**FET**\") as required by Article 4(2) and the prohibition against \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures\" provided for in Article 4(1) of the BIT.265\n\nC-II, para. 398.\n\n283.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and liquidation of such investments. [...]\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party. This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by its own investors or than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments within its territory by investors of the most favoured nation, if this latter is more favourable. [...]\" [Emphasis added]\n\n284.\n\nThe rule thus imposes both a positive and a negative obligation upon the Czech Republic:\n\n- The positive obligation is to accord within its territory FET to the protected investments of Swiss investors; and the standard applied must not be less than the treatment given to its own investors or those of the most favoured nation;\n\n- The negative obligation is to abstain from impairing any protected investment through the adoption of measures which are either unreasonable or discriminatory.\n\n285.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent breached the FET standard enshrined in Article 4 in three ways:\n\n- By adopting unreasonable measures [**VII.1.2**];\n\n- By adopting discriminatory measures, which provided less favorable treatment to Claimants\u2019 investments [**VII.1.3.**] and\n\n- By violating Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations [**VII.1.4.**].\n\n286.\n\nBefore analyzing each of the alleged breaches, the Tribunal will devote a section to analyse Article 4 in general [**VII.1.1**].\n\n**VII.1.1.** **A****pplicable law****: A****rticle** **4** **of the** **BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nClaimants say that Respondent\u2019s conduct resulted in a breach of Articles 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n**1.** **T****he** **FET** **standard**\n---------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe first sentence of Article 4(2) of the BIT is a rule of laconic brevity and delphic obscurity: it simply obliges the Contracting States to ensure \"fair and equitable treatment\" to investments of protected investors.\n\n289.\n\nThe FET standard requires that the host state treat the protected investment in an even-handed and just manner, avoiding intentional harassment and denial of justice. The precise scope of protection is intimately related:\n\n- to the legitimate and reasonable expectations on which the investor relied, including the stability of the host State\u2019s legal framework; and\n\n- to the specific undertakings and representations proffered by the host State at the time when the investment was made.\n\n290.\n\nThe legitimacy or reasonableness of the investor\u2019s expectations must be assessed in conjunction with the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions in the host State, and in particular, balancing the right of the State under international law to regulate within its borders.\n\n291.\n\nThe obligation to provide FET binds the State as a whole. It can be breached by the conduct of any branch of government. In principle, then, the FET standard can be breached:\n\n- by the executive or administrative branch or its separate agencies by means of administrative acts that directly target the investment;\n\n- by the State\u2019s judicial system as a whole, when it is responsible for a denial of justice which affects the investment; or\n\n- by the enactment of laws or regulations of general application, which radically modify the applicable legal framework to the detriment of the investment.\n\n292.\n\nThe threshold of propriety required by FET must be determined by the Tribunal in light of all the relevant circumstances of the case. To this end, the Tribunal must carefully analyse and take into consideration all the relevant facts, and, *inter alia,* weigh the following factors:\n\n- whether the State made specific representations to the investor before the investment was made and then acted contrary to such representations;\n\n- whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework, in breach of the investor's legitimate expectations;\n\n- whether the host State has engaged in harassment, coercion, abuse of power, or other bad faith conduct against the investor266;\n\n- whether the State has respected the principles of due process, consistency and transparency when adopting the measures at issue.\n\nBad faith conduct is a factor which must be taken into consideration by the Tribunal, but the Claimant is not required to prove fault in the sense of intention to harm; See *Mondev,* **CL-13**, para. 116.\n\n293.\n\nIn evaluating the State's conduct, the Tribunal must balance the investor's right to be protected from improper State conduct against other legally relevant interests and countervailing factors. First among these factors is the principle that legislation and regulation are dynamic, and that (absent a treaty obligation to the contrary) States enjoy a sovereign right to amend their laws and regulations and to adopt new ones in furtherance of the public interest. Other countervailing factors affect the investor: it is the investor's duty to perform an appropriate pre-investment due diligence review and to conduct itself in accordance with the law both before and during the investment.267\n\n*Rusoro,* **RL-79**, para. 525; *Lemire,* **RL-83**, para. 285.\n\n**2.** **U****NREASONABLE MEASURES**\n------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nUnder Article 4(1) of the BIT, the Czech Republic has assumed the negative obligation to abstain from unreasonable or discriminatory measures affecting protected investments. A literal interpretation of the rule shows that for a measure to amount to a violation of the BIT it is sufficient if it is either unreasonable or discriminatory; it need not be both.\n\n295.\n\nAny unreasonable or discriminatory measure may, by definition, also be said to be unfair and inequitable. The reverse is not true, though. A government measure may fall short of the FET standard, for reasons other than that it is discriminatory or unreasonable.268\n\n*Lemire*, **RL-83**, para. 259.\n\n296.\n\nAn interesting feature of Article 4(1) of the BIT is the drafters' choice of terminology. Other BITs include a prohibition against \"arbitrary or discriminatory\" measures. The Swiss-Czech BIT however uses the expression \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" measures.\n\n297.\n\nAre \"unreasonable measures\" and \"arbitrary measures\" synonymous?\n\nArbitrary measures\n------------------\n\n298.\n\nArbitrariness has been described as \"founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact\";269 \"[...] contrary to the law because: '[it] shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety'\";270 or (in very similar terms) \"willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of judicial propriety\";271 or as conduct which \"manifestly violate[s] the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination.\"272\n\n*Occidental,* **RL-134**, para. 162, quoting *Lauder,* para. 221.\n\n*Tecmed,* **CL-17**, para. 154, quoting *ELSI,* **RL-56,** para. 128.\n\n*ELSI,* **RL-56,** para. 128; quoted in *Loewen,* **RL-53**, para. 131.\n\n*Saluka,* **RL-84**, para. 307.\n\n299.\n\nIn *EDF,* Professor Schreuer, appearing as an expert, defined as \"arbitrary\":273\n\n\"a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;\n\nb. a measure that is not based on legal standards, but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;\n\nc. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;\n\nd. a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.\"\n\nAnd the *EDF* tribunal seemed to accept his definition in its analysis and ultimate rejection of the claim that Romania had adopted arbitrary measures.274\n\n*EDF*, **RL-180**, para. 303.\n\n*EDF*, **RL-180**, para. 303.\n\nUnreasonable measures\n---------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe BIT does not refer to \"arbitrary measures.\" It prohibits \"unreasonable measures\", *i.e.,* measures adopted by the host State that are irrational in themselves or result from an irrational decision-making process. All arbitrary measures are, by definition, unreasonable, because rational State action cannot result in the substitution of the rule of law by prejudice, preference or bias.275 The opposite is not necessarily true: an irrational decision-making process may result in an unreasonable measure, but the content of the measure does not have to be arbitrary (although in most cases, unreasonable decision-making will result in arbitrary results). In any case, the exposure to irrational processes may by itself be a breach of the duty to act in accordance with the FET standard.\n\n*Lemire*, **RL-83**, paras. 262-263.\n\n301.\n\nThe tribunal in *LG&E* said that the contracting states (in that case Argentina and the United States)276\n\n\"wanted to prohibit themselves from implementing measures that affect the investments of nationals of the other Party without engaging in a rational decision-making process.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n*LG&E,* **CL-68**, para. 158.\n\n302.\n\nThe *LG&E* tribunal added:\n\n\"Certainly a State that fails to base its actions on reasoned judgement, and uses abusive arguments instead, would not 'stimulate the flow of private capital\u2019.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n303.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the treaty under consideration in *LG&E* contained a prohibition in respect of \"arbitrary or discriminatory measures\", and that the tribunal concluded that unreasonable or irrational measures breached such prohibition - proving the proximity of and overlap between both concepts. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants\u2019 conclusion that in investment arbitration cases, the term \"unreasonable\" is often used interchangeably with the terms \"unjustified\" or \"arbitrary.\"277\n\nC-I, para. 297, referring to C. Schreuer, \"Protection Against Arbitrary or Discriminatory Matters\", in C. Rogers and R. Alford (eds.), The Future of Investment Arbitration, Oxford 2009, **CL-29**, p. 183.\n\n304.\n\nBe that as it may, in the present case, Claimants plead the higher standard: they say that the measures adopted by the Czech Republic were not only unreasonable, but that they also meet the arbitrariness test.\n\n**3.** **D****iscriminatory measures**\n--------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the BIT also prohibits the adoption by the Czech Republic of discriminatory measures against a protected investment. Article 4(2) provides an additional rule: the treatment must not be less favourable than the treatment granted to investments made by Czech investors, or by investors of the most favoured nation, if this latter treatment is more favourable.\n\n306.\n\nDiscrimination means unequal or different treatment. But this, in itself, is insufficient. To amount to discrimination, the protected investment must be treated differently from similar cases without justification278 such that the host State \"expos[es] the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice\"279 or \"target[s] Claimants\u2019 investments specifically as foreign investments.\"280\n\n*Saluka,* **RL-84**, para. 313.\n\n*Waste Management II,* **CL-14**, para. 98.\n\n*LG&E,* **CL-68**, para. 147.\n\n307.\n\nDiscrimination is a relative standard, which requires a comparative analysis between the measures applied to the protected investment and the measures applied to investments in similar situations. One leading commentator provides the following guidance by which to establish whether similar cases are being treated differently281:\n\n\"... start by looking at a narrow circle of comparators that are closest to the case at hand. In other words, the treatment of other investors in the same line of business will have to be looked at first. If there are clear indications of discrimination already on that basis, the matter may be regarded as settled. But the absence of discrimination within this narrow group is not necessarily conclusive. For instance, if the particular sector of the economy is small or is strongly dominated by foreign interests, it would not be sufficient for the tribunal to satisfy itself that no discrimination has occurred within that group of investors. The circle may be widened to a broader sector of activity that includes a variety of economic actors until a workable basis for comparison can be found.\"\n\nC. Schreuer, \"Protection Against Arbitrary or Discriminatory Matters\", in C. Rogers and R. Alford (eds.), The Future of Investment Arbitration, Oxford 2009, **CL-29,** p. 196.\n\nNational Treatment and Most Favored-Nation treatment\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the BIT defines the National Treatment (\"**NT**\") and the Most Favored-Nation (\"**MFN**\") standards:\n\n\"This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by its own investors or than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments within its territory by investors of the most favoured nation, if this latter is more favourable.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n309.\n\nThe NT and MFN standards, which are closely related to the wider and overreaching FET standard,282 prohibit discrimination based on nationality. Under these standards the Czech Republic may not subject protected investors or their investments to a treatment which is \"less favourable\" than that which the host State accords to investments owned by other investors - either Czech or from other countries. To establish that the treatment effectively is \"less favourable,\" a comparator in like circumstances must be defined.283 It is also widely accepted that there must be no objective reason which justifies the differential treatment.284\n\nA.

It thereby violated the protection against unreasonable treatment in Article 4(1) and the guarantees of FET under Article 4(2), as explained below.\n\nC-I, paras. 66-68; an argument which Respondent does not deny.\n\n**1.1 T****he conduct of** **B****enice****\u2019****s** **M****ayor and the** **B****enice** **D****istrict** **A****ssembly was** **ARBITRARY****,** **UNREASONABLE AND IN BAD FAITH**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nClaimants point to three particular actions of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and the Benice District Assembly which they argue were arbitrary, unreasonable and in bad faith:\n\n- Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's multiple attempts to extract payment from Claimants [**A.**];\n\n- Benice's filing of the Annulment Request, seeking to annul the Zoning Plan Change [**B.**]; and\n\n- Benice's opposition to reprocuring the Zoning Plan Change [**C.**].\n\n314.\n\nClaimants also argue that these actions taken by officials of Benice and of the City of Prague were not only arbitrary, unreasonable and taken in bad faith, but that they also violated the FET standard for want of transparency.286 According to Claimants, the lack of transparency stems from Respondent's inconsistent application of its own laws and from its incoherent behaviour surrounding the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change.287\n\nC-II, para. 482.\n\nC-II, para. 479.\n\nA. **Benice\u2019s attempts to extract payment from Claimants violated the FET standard**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nClaimants assert that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 was the driving force behind Benice's attempts to annul the zoning plan change and thereby destroy the Project. According to Claimants, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 exercised her power as Mayor of Benice to try to extort unjustified payments from Claimants. When these efforts were unsuccessful, she retaliated by filing the Annulment Request.288\n\nC-PHB, para. 80.\n\n316.\n\nClaimants identify three actions taken by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 in violation of the FET standard:\n\n317.\n\nFirst, Claimants say that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 attempted to extort funds from them with the 2009 Benice Lawsuit, which challenged Projekt Sever\u2019s title to the land it had purchased from the City of Prague. Claimants note that Ms. Topi\u010dov\u00e1 has not denied that Benice made these payment demands, and that she refused to answer when asked at the Hearing whether she would have challenged the zoning change if Projekt Sever had paid what Benice demanded in 2009.289\n\nC-PHB, para. 81, referring to Topicov\u00e1 WS I, paras. 28-29; Topicov\u00e1 WS II, para. 26; HT 699:7-700:4, 744:9-12; HT 700:22-701:22; See also C-II, paras. 245-252.\n\n318.\n\nSecond, Claimants say that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 tried again to extort payment from them by withholding Benice\u2019s approval of the density increase from OB-B to OB-C in early 2011. In this case Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 withheld approval while asking for a payment from Claimants of CZK 15 million in exchange for Benice\u2019s \"smooth cooperation in the permitting stages.\" Claimants note that Ms. Topi\u010dov\u00e1 does not deny this, and that she admits having met with Mr. Pawlowski and asking him to contribute to \"civil amenities.\"290\n\nC-PHB, para. 83.\n\n319.\n\nThird, Claimants point to Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s lack of response regarding the connection of the Project to gas lines and to the sewer system. Claimants argue that while such requests are normally acted on within a matter of days, in this case Benice did not respond. Claimants believe that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 was again attempting to extract payments from Mr. Pawlowski by using this request as leverage.291\n\nC-PHB, para. 84.\n\nB. **Benice\u2019s Annulment Request was unreasonable**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nClaimants argue that Benice\u2019s filing of the Annulment Request to prevent residential development of the area altogether was a use of legal process for a purpose for which it was not intended, in violation of the FET standard.292 According to Claimants, this would still be the case even if the Tribunal were to find that Benice had filed the Annulment Request due to its alleged concerns about the scale of the Project293; the filing of an annulment lawsuit should still be considered a disproportionate measure in light of available alternatives (such as seeking to reduce the scope of the Project) and that it was thus a violation of the FET standard.294\n\nC-PHB, para. 104, referring to *Tecmed,* **CL-17**, para. 154; *Frontier Petroleum,* **CL-21**, para. 300; See also C-II, paras. 253-262.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 106-107.\n\nC-PHB, para. 106, referring to *Watkins Holdings,* **CL-112**, para. 601; *SolEs Badajoz,* **CL-114**, para. 328.\n\n321.\n\nFurthermore, since Benice acted to destroy the Claimants\u2019 investment without providing any advance notice, this also violated the FET standard transparency requirement.295\n\nC-PHB, para. 106, referring to *Glencore,* **CL-113**, para. 1448.\n\nC. **Benice\u2019s opposition to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change was unreasonable**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Benice\u2019s insistence that there should be no residential development of the Project Area whatsoever was entirely unreasonable and disproportionate in the context of the achievement of the policy aims claimed by Respondent. This subsequent behaviour both confirms that Benice\u2019s filing of the annulment lawsuit was not brought in good faith and for proper purposes and is itself a violation of the FET standard.296\n\nC-PHB, para. 113.\n\n323.\n\nClaimants assert that after the Annulment Decision was issued, Benice could, and should, have supported re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, while at the same time addressing its alleged concerns with respect to the scope and potential impact of the Project on the local community.\n\n**1.2 T****he actions of the** **C****ity of** **P****rague were unreasonable**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nClaimants also maintain that the City of Prague acted unreasonably. Specifically, Claimants allege that Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s blocking of the normal re-procurement process [**A.**] and the City Assembly\u2019s decision to terminate the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change [**B.**] amounted to breaches of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\nA. **Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s refusal to allow the normal re-procurement process to proceed**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nAccording to Claimants, if the landowner wanted to pursue the change, the normal course of action following the Annulment Decision would have been for the City of Prague\u2019s Zoning Plan Division (the Procurer) promptly to remedy the deficiencies.297 Claimants assert that this would have only required drafting a more detailed substantiation for approval by the City Assembly, and there were no substantive reasons why the zoning plan change could not have been re-procured.298\n\nC-PHB, para. 117, referring to Nov\u00e1cek Police statement, 17 June 2015, **C-84**, p. 3; Nov\u00e1\u010dek WS, paras. 19-20, 38; Langmajer WS I, paras. 22-26; Langmajer WS II, para. 12; Votava WS, para. 23.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 116-117.\n\n326.\n\nClaimants allege that the normal course of action was interrupted by Mayor Hude\u010dek, who prevented the City from moving forward with the re-procurement during his entire term in office.299\n\nC-PHB, para. 118, referring to Nov\u00e1cek WS, para. 21; HT 412:24-413:10, 414:5-415:5, 415:23-416:13.\n\nB. **The City\u2019s decision to terminate the procurement**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, not only was it standard practice for the City Assembly to re-procure zoning changes annulled by Czech Courts, it was also outside the City Assembly\u2019s discretion to decide whether or not to proceed with the procurement.300 Thus, Claimants argue that the Prague City Assembly\u2019s decision to terminate the procurement was unreasonable, arbitrary and disproportionate.301\n\nC-II, paras. 263-289.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 133-153.\n\n328.\n\nClaimants allege that Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd acted arbitrarily and unreasonably, because he opposed the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change without visiting the site or examining the substance or history of the Project. According to Claimants, in all other cases where a request had been made for re-procurement, the re-procurement was initiated without being subjected to a vote of the City Assembly.302\n\nC-PHB, para. 135, referring to City Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, pp. 7-8; HT 790:10-795:7.\n\n329.\n\nClaimants also note that the City of Prague\u2019s treatment of Claimants was different from what would usually be expected, since it marked the first time in the history of the Czech Republic that an applicant for a zoning change had requested annulment of the zoning change after it had come into effect, and that a zoning change was annulled for formal reasons and not re-procured again, notwithstanding the landowner\u2019s request.303\n\nC-PHB, para. 146.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nRespondent denies that Benice [**2.1**] or the City of Prague [**2.2**] acted arbitrarily, unreasonably or in bad faith, and makes the following preliminary clarifications regarding both bad faith and transparency:\n\nBad faith\n---------\n\n331.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 description of the requirement of good faith is flawed. Respondent argues that Claimants have in any event failed to prove any bad faith on the part of the State, while noting that the standard of proof for allegations of bad faith is \"a demanding one.\"304\n\nR-I, para. 282, referring to *Bayindir Insaat,* **RL-76**, paras. 143, 223.\n\n332.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it cannot have acted in bad faith, since there were legitimate and objective reasons which led the City Assembly to terminate the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, including:\n\n- The non-applicability of Section 55(3) to the annulled Zoning Change with the consequence that the Prague Assembly had no obligation to resume the procurement process;\n\n- The fact that the annulment of the Zoning Change had restored the land to its original functional use;\n\n- Benice\u2019s opposition to the procurement process;\n\n- The various substantive and procedural defects of the annulled Zoning Change, as determined by the Municipal Court and the Supreme Administrative Court; and\n\n- The fact that Projekt Server was specifically advised of the possibility of filing a new application for a zoning change.\n\n- Projekt Sever had bought the land while it was zoned for agricultural purposes, the same use to which the land was restored.305\n\nR-I, para. 289.\n\nTransparency\n------------\n\n333.\n\nRespondent argues that there is no basis for Claimants\u2019 assertions of non-transparency. According to Respondent, the simple fact that the Czech Republic might have departed from usual practice does not establish a lack of transparency or arbitrariness.306\n\nR-II, paras. 412-413.\n\n**2.1 N****either** **B****enice****\u2019****s** **M****ayor nor the** **B****enice district assembly acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the threshold for a finding of arbitrariness is very high, requiring conduct which \"shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.\"307\n\nR-PHB, para. 186, citing *Crystallex,* **CL-12**, para. 577.\n\n335.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 allegations are unfounded. It maintains that Mayor Topicova never tried to extort money from Claimants [**A.**] and Benice\u2019s actions were within its prerogatives and neither unreasonable, nor unjustifiable [**B.**].\n\nA. **The Mayor of Benice never tried to extort money from Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nRespondent rejects the assertion that Mayor Topicova improperly attempted to extract payments from Claimants. Rather, Mayor Topicova\u2019s main concern was ensuring that Benice had sufficient resources to adapt its infrastructure to the anticipated large influx of new residents.308\n\nR-I, para. 285; R-II, para. 413.\n\n337.\n\nWith respect to Mayor Topicova\u2019s request for CZK 15 million, Respondent claims that Mayor Topicova was simply defending the interests of her community by attempting to negotiate with Mr. Pawlowski and thereby obtain funds to renovate Benice\u2019s civic amenities and infrastructure.309\n\nR-PHB, para. 45.\n\n338.\n\nAs regards Mayor Topicova\u2019s requests for CZK 20 and 30 million, Respondent argues that Mayor Topicova was simply negotiating (through Benice\u2019s lawyers) to recover the proceeds of the land sale through a settlement.310\n\nR-PHB, para. 46.\n\nB. **Benice did not act in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nRespondent avers that there was no abuse of legal process in Benice seeking annulment of the Zoning Change, and that Benice was simply exerting its legal right before the Czech courts.311\n\nR-II, paras. 291-292; R-PHB, para. 191.\n\n340.\n\nRespondent also notes that there were no improper motives behind Benice\u2019s exercise of its legal right to seek annulment of the Zoning Change. Respondent asserts that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 had no personal animosity against Mr. Pawlowski or any reason to \"retaliate\" against him. Rather, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 simply acted in the interests of Benice, due to the impact that Claimants\u2019 huge Project would have had on the municipality and its inhabitants.312\n\nR-PHB, para. 192.\n\n341.\n\nRespondent rejects the notion that it was unheard of for a municipality to propose, and later to challenge, the same zoning plan change. To the contrary, Respondent argues that, as zoning plan changes are the subject of a long and democratic process, it is in fact a frequent occurrence that a borough, after having applied for a zoning change, will then change its mind and withdraw it.313\n\nR-PHB, para. 193, referring to: HT 544:1-545:10 (Boh\u00e1\u010d, Direct).

However, Respondent argues, in this case Benice had no alternative way to avoid the construction of the Project - which would have had a negative impact on Benice and its inhabitants.314\n\nR-PHB, para. 194.\n\n343.\n\nRespondent says that Benice would not have been able to influence the Project\u2019s development during the permitting stage: once a zoning change comes into force, from that moment on, the local government \"does not interfere into the permitting process in the way it could during the procurement of the zoning change.\"315 Thus, Benice\u2019s only means of alleviating its concerns was to seek annulment of the Zoning Plan Change through the Czech Courts.\n\nR-PHB, para. 195, referring to HT 896-897.\n\n**2.2 T****he** **C****ity of** **P****rague did not act unreasonably or arbitrarily**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nRespondent rejects the complaint that the City of Prague acted arbitrarily or unreasonably.\n\nA. **Mayor Hude\u010dek acted appropriately**\n----------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nRespondents aver that neither the Mayor, nor his Deputy Mayor, acted arbitrarily. Respondent rejects the claim that Mayor Hude\u010dek \"refused\" to address the Zoning Plan Change at the meetings of the City Assembly. According to Respondent, both Mayor Hude\u010dek and Mr. Boh\u00e1\u010d have confirmed that the regular practice in dealing with zoning changes was followed, and that the Mayor adhered to the technical advice of the Zoning Plan Division.316\n\nR-PHB, para. 105; R-II, paras. 130-134.\n\n346.\n\nRespondent also rejects the allegation that Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd made statements to the Assembly inimical to the interests of Mr. Pawlowski or the zoning plan change.317 To the extent that the Deputy Mayor may have been opposed to the Claimants\u2019 Project in principle, Respondent argues that this was not the result of any animosity or arbitrary action against Mr. Pawlowski, but due to Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd\u2019s political views, which were in line with those of the Green Party which he represented, and which were generally against developers, who have sought to develop the outskirts of the City of Prague for maximum profit and at the expense of the City.318\n\nR-PHB, para. 109.\n\nR-PHB, para. 118.\n\nB. **The Prague City Assembly also acted appropriately**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nWith respect to the actions of the Prague City Assembly, Respondent argues that these actions cannot be construed as arbitrary or unjustifiable, since in all instances, the Assembly acted in full compliance with Czech law, demonstrating no abuse of administrative discretion.319\n\nR-II, para. 208; R-PHB, para. 197.\n\n348.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 claim is based on the premise that, following the Annulment Decision, the Prague City Assembly acted abusively and in breach of the applicable law, particularly Section 55(3) of the 2006 Building Act. However, according to Respondent, the Prague City Assembly was never in breach of Section 55(3) of the Building Act, since320:\n\n- this section of the Building Act applies to annulled zoning plans, and not annulled zoning changes321;\n\n- the Prague City Assembly nevertheless decided \"without delay\" on the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change322; and\n\n- irrespective of whether Section 55(3) applied in the circumstances, it did not impose any obligation on the Prague City Assembly to re-procure an annulled zoning change.323\n\nSee also R-II, paras. 121-126.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 63-70.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 71-75.\n\nR-PHB, para. 76.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nClaimants argue that certain measures adopted by the Czech Republic, or by agents and institutions for which the State is responsible under international law, were not only unreasonable, but that these measures also met the test of being arbitrary, and even in bad faith, in breach of the general prohibition of \"unreasonable measures\" contained in Article 4(1) (and of the FET standard enshrined in Article 4(2) of the BIT).\n\n350.\n\nClaimants single out the following measures:\n\n- Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s attempts to extract payment from Claimants;\n\n- Benice\u2019s filing of the Annulment Request, by which it sought to annul the Zoning Plan Change;\n\n- Benice\u2019s opposition to the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change;\n\n- Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s refusal to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change; and\n\n- The City Assembly\u2019s decision to terminate the procurement.\n\n351.\n\nRespondent disagrees:\n\n- It says that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 never tried to extort money from Claimants and that Benice\u2019s actions were within its prerogatives and neither unreasonable nor unjustifiable;\n\n- As regards the actions of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd, Respondents aver that neither the Mayor, nor the Deputy Mayor acted arbitrarily;\n\n- With respect to the actions of the Prague City Assembly, Respondent argues that these actions cannot be construed as arbitrary or unjustifiable, since in all instances the Assembly acted in full compliance with Czech law, demonstrating no abuse of administrative discretion.324\n\nR-II, para. 208; R-PHB, para. 197.\n\n352.\n\nIn the following subsections, the Tribunal will analyze Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s conduct with respect to the requests for payment [**3.1.**], the filing by Benice of the annulment [**3.2.**], Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s refusal to support the re-procurement [**3.3.**] the City Assembly\u2019s decision to terminate the procurement [**3.4.**] and Benice\u2019s opposition to the re-procurement [**3.5.**].\n\n**3.1 T****he requests for payment**\n------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal will first briefly recall the facts [**A.**] and will then analyse whether such conduct violates the BIT [**B.**].\n\nA. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe proven facts show that Benice\u2019s Mayor requested funds from the investor on two occasions. Claimants also refer to certain other instances,325 where the conduct of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 allegedly was detrimental to Claimants\u2019 interests, but the Tribunal has found no evidence that these incidents resulted from improper requests for the disbursements of funds.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 84 *et seq.*\n\nFirst attempt\n-------------\n\n355.\n\nIn October 2009, Benice filed the Benice Lawsuit against Project Sever, contesting the validity of Projekt Sever\u2019s purchase of land from the City of Prague. Benice asseverated that its District, and not the District of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, should have represented the City of Prague in the sale of the land326 and that the purchase price should have been received by Benice and not by Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves.327\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 33; Topi\u010dov\u00e1 WS I, para. 27.\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 34; Topi\u010dov\u00e1 WS I, para. 18.\n\n356.\n\nShortly after Benice filed the lawsuit, a lawyer representing the District of Benice informed Dr. Zugar (Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s lawyer) that Benice would be willing to withdraw the Court case if Claimants paid the District CZK 20 million.328 Mr. Pawlowski met with Benice\u2019s Mayor Topi\u010dova, who explained that the District had been deprived of the funds that the City of Prague had received for the land purchased and that CZK 30 million (an increase from the CZK 20 million previously mentioned by Benice\u2019s lawyer to Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s lawyer) would be an adequate compensation to reach an amicable settlement.329 Mr. Pawlowski refused to make the payment and protested against what he saw as an the attempt to hold him hostage in these circumstances.330\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 35; Topi\u010dov\u00e1 WS II, para. 31.\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 37; Topi\u010dov\u00e1 WS II, para. 31.\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 38.\n\nSecond attempt\n--------------\n\n357.\n\nOn 19 January 2011, Projekt Sever submitted a proposal to increase the density coefficient from 0.3 (\"OB-B\") to 0.5 (\"OB-C\").331 The Construction Division of Prague 22 and the Deputy Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves both approved the proposal. Benice, however, issued a negative opinion, noting that it stood by its original statement on the project from December 2008.332\n\nGuidelines for the Land Use Plan for the Capital City of Prague, 1 November 2002, **C-135**, p. 24/89.\n\nNegative statement of Benice on Zoning Plan Modification U969, 7 March 2011, **C-65**.\n\n358.\n\nShortly thereafter, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 informed Dr. Dobrohru\u0161kov\u00e1, a lawyer with DLA Piper hired to assist Claimants on planning issues, that the District could accept a density increase, but requested a payment from Projekt Sever to the District of Benice, as consideration for its cooperation.333 On 6 May 2011, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, using her private email address, sent an email to Dr. Dobrohruskov\u00e1, confirming that a meeting had taken place and that the matter discussed had been \"retracting our original negative opinion\" to the modification of the Zoning Plan from OB-B to OB-C. She requested Mr. Pawlowski to make a concrete proposal.334\n\nC-I, paras. 119-122; C-II, para. 219; Pawlowski WS I, para. 42; E-Mail from Mayor Topicova to Dr. Dobrohru\u0161kov\u00e1, 6 May 2011, **C-68**.\n\nE-Mail from Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 to Dr. Dobrohru\u0161kov\u00e1, 6 May 2011, **C-68.**\n\n359.\n\nNo such proposal was made.\n\nB. **Decision**\n---------------\n\n360.\n\nThe proven facts can be summarized as follows:\n\n- On two occasions, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, acting on behalf of the District of Benice, asked Claimants for certain payments; the first request was made in 2009 and the second in 2011;\n\n- The first request was for an amount of initially CZK 20 million, thereafter increased to CZK 30 million; the second request was apparently for CZK 15 million (this is the amount averred by Claimants; the Mayor, although acknowledging that the request took place, does not recall the specific amount);335\n\n- It is acknowledged that the suggestion was that Projekt Sever should pay the funds to the District of Benice - not personally to Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1;\n\n- Projekt Sever was under no legal obligation to make these payments; Respondent has not drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to any legal provision creating such obligation. To the contrary, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 presented the payments as a *quid pro quo;* if Projekt Sever made the first payment, the District would withdraw the Benice Lawsuit, and if it made the second payment, the District would abandon its opposition to the increase in the density coefficient;\n\n- Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 explained in her witness statements that the purpose of the first payment request was \"to reach an amicable settlement in the context of the lawsuit that contested the sale\"336 of the land to Projekt Sever, and the purpose of the second request was to \"renovate Bernice\u2019s civic amenities\";337\n\n- Mr. Pawlowski and Claimants rejected both payment requests.\n\nTopi\u010dov\u00e1 WS II, para. 31.\n\nTopi\u010dov\u00e1 WS II, para. 31.\n\nHT 711:16-17; Topi\u010dov\u00e1 WS II, para. 31.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n361.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether the payment requests made by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, on behalf of the District of Benice, constitute an unreasonable measure, in breach of the specific prohibition and of the general FET standard guaranteed in Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Benice\u2019s conduct does indeed constitute a breach of Article 4 of the BIT. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal finds the following arguments compelling:\n\n363.\n\nFirst, public authorities are vested with wide ranging powers, to be exercised in the furtherance of the common good; to prevent misuse, it is a generally accepted principle of the rule of law that such powers should be established by law and exercised in accordance with proper procedure. The risk of misuse is especially severe when powers are used to impose on citizens payments to the benefit of the State; taxation, and any other measures requiring citizens to contribute funds to public institutions, must strictly respect the principles of legality and proper administrative procedure.\n\n364.\n\nIn the present case, these principles have not been adhered to:\n\n- Respondent has failed to refer to any Czech law, authorising the Mayor of Benice to condition the withdrawal of a lawsuit or the consent to a change in the zoning requirements upon the making of payments by the affected private individuals; the necessary conclusion is that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 acted on her own initiative, her conduct being neither foreseen in, nor authorized by, any legal norm;\n\n- The proven facts also show that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 did not adhere to any proper administrative procedure; there is no evidence in the file that she sought the authorisation of the Benice District Assembly or of any other administrative body, nor that she initiated any administrative procedure to document and formalise the payment requests. She informally convened meetings with Mr. Pawlowski or with his counsel, which were not recorded or summarised in writing, and in the course of these meetings she informed the investor that if certain amounts were paid, the District would amend its conduct to the benefit of the investor. It is telling that the only communication in the file which Mayor Topi\u010dova sent to Claimants or their counsel regarding the requests for payment was issued from her private gmail account, and not from her official account at the Municipality;\n\n- There is no evidence in the file that the amounts requested (CZK 15 million, CZK 20 million and eventually CZK 30 million) were established on the basis of rational analysis or by reference to the specific costs and benefits to the District of Benice to which the Project would give rise; to the contrary, the figures seem to have been estimated by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 as the highest amounts which the investor was likely to accept; in the email sent to Dr. Dobrohru\u0161kov\u00e1 (Claimants\u2019 counsel), the Mayor went so far as to request the developer to make a counter-offer:\n\n\"[...] we would like to see at least some concept of the agreement, so that we can discuss it. Could I ask you to inform me of Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s view of the matter?\"338\n\nE-Mail from Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 to Dr. Dobrohru\u0161kov\u00e1, 6 May 2011, **C-68**.\n\nArbitrariness\n-------------\n\n365.\n\nAs the Tribunal has noted at para. 299 above, Professor Schreuer has defined as \"arbitrary\" measures which fall into four categories:\n\n\"a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;\n\nb. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;\n\nc. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;\n\nd. a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.\"339\n\n*EDF,* **RL-180**, para. 303.\n\n366.\n\nMayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s actions fall within two of Prof. Schreuer\u2019s categories:\n\n- the requests for payments were not based on any legal standard and had no objective rational basis, and\n\n- they were made in total disregard of due process and proper procedure.\n\nThe necessary consequence is that these measures must be considered arbitrary - and by extension unreasonable; all arbitrary measures are by definition unreasonable, because rational action on the part of a State cannot result in the substitution of the rule of law by prejudice, preference or bias.340\n\n*Lemire,* **RL-83**, paras. 262-263.\n\n367.\n\nSecond, Claimants say that Mr. Pawlowski was faced with a classic \"red flag\" situation, in which it appeared that a public official was demanding corrupt payments for doing a job that should be done anyway, as required by law, and that for this reason he (properly) refused to make a payment.341 Mr. Pawlowski adds that he became suspicious, because the amount asked for was very high compared with the annual budget of the Benice District, which only amounted to CZK 3 million (most of the administration being done by the District of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves).342\n\nC-PHB, para. 98; HT 178:1-179:3; Pawlowski WS I, paras. 40, 43-44; Pawlowski WS II, paras. 61-62.\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 40.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal has sympathy for Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s predicament, even accepting that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s aim was to obtain monies for the benefit of Benice District.\n\n369.\n\nThe request made by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 did constitute a \"red flag.\" Investors should not be required to make, and they are entitled to, and should, abstain from making, ostensibly facilitative payments in favour of public institutions of the host State, as a *quid pro quo* for administrative measures which, by law, such institutions are obliged to provide for free -especially if such payments have no support in law and the amount has been essentially plucked out of the air by the public official concerned. Had Mr. Pawlowski paid, he would have opened the floodgates to a possible challenge or even incrimination that the investment was procured through corrupt means.\n\n370.\n\nThird, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s decision to file the Benice Lawsuit against Projekt Sever, the buyer of the land, but not against Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, the seller, might seem counterintuitive and legally flawed. In fact, there are indications that, by suing Projekt Sever but not Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, Benice\u2019s real aim was to force a negotiation with the investor and to extract additional payments:\n\n- Benice\u2019s main argument in the Benice Lawsuit was that the purchase price of the land should flow to Benice and not to Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves; Projekt Sever, the buyer, had already paid the full purchase price to Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, and the reasonable way to proceed would have been to request that the recipient of the funds disgorge the allegedly ill-gotten proceeds;\n\n- At the Hearing, when questioned about the payment required from Claimants in order to drop the lawsuit, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 admitted to instructing Benice\u2019s lawyers \"to get the sum of money for the sale of the land located in our cadastral territory\",343 and refused to comment further;344\n\n- The Benice Lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, in the first instance by the District Court and thereafter on appeal, due to Benice\u2019s lack of standing: Municipal Districts cannot own property and only act as managers of entrusted property;345 additionally, the Court rejected the argument that Benice was in charge of administering the plots of land and confirmed that Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves was the rightful administrator.346\n\nHT 700:2-4.\n\nHT 700:20-21.\n\nDistrict Court Judgment in file 28 C 349/2009-78, 8 March 2012, **C-64**, pp. 12-13.\n\nDistrict Court Judgment in file 28 C 349/2009-78, 8 March 2012, **C-64**, p. 14.\n\n371.\n\nSumming up, while the Tribunal is prepared to accept that the requests for significant payments from Projekt Sever as a condition for the withdrawal of the Benice Lawsuit filed by the District and for the District\u2019s change of opinion with regard to the increase in the density coefficient, were made for the benefit of the residents of Benice, the fact remains that the requests were made without any support in Czech law and outside any established administrative procedure. The investors were entitled to consider such requests to be irregular, improper, and even indicative of, or as an invitation to engage in, conduct that is unlawful.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it fair that investors should be put in a position where they are requested by a public authority to make payments to secure the progress of their projects, unless the invitations are made within an established and transparent legal and administrative framework. That is so regardless of the motives or the intended use of any funds paid or sought to be procured. For this reason, the Tribunal considers that the requests made to Projekt Sever on behalf of Benice District do not meet the standard of reasonableness mandated by Article 4(1) and fall short of the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment that Article 4(2) requires the Respondent to ensure.\n\n373.\n\nThe Mayor of Benice represents an organ of the Czech Republic at a territorial level, and in accordance with Article 4 of the ILC Articles her conduct must be attributed to the Czech Republic. The necessary consequence is that the Czech Republic has committed an internationally wrongful act in breach of the BIT.\n\n**3.2 F****iling of the** **A****nnulment** **R****equest by** **B****enice**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nClaimants argue that Benice\u2019s 2012 filing of the Annulment Request of the Zoning Change was an arbitrary347 and disproportionate348 measure in violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT. Respondent avers that there was no abuse of legal process in Benice seeking annulment of the Zoning Change, and that Benice was simply exerting its legal right before the Czech Courts.349\n\nC-II, paras. 253-262; C-PHB, para. 104.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 106-107.\n\nR-II, paras. 291-292; R-PHB, para. 191.\n\n375.\n\nIn order to determine whether Benice\u2019s filing of the Annulment Request constitutes a violation of the BIT, the Tribunal will first briefly set out the facts [**A.**], and will then discuss and decide the issue [**B.**].\n\nA. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n376.\n\n*Pro memoria,* by early 2012, the development of the Project seemed to be proceeding as planned: the Zoning Change had been approved by the Prague Assembly, the increase in density had been accepted by the Municipal authority and the planning permit application, the last step before the building permit, had been submitted by Claimants\u2019 architects.\n\n377.\n\nBut then the District of Benice, led by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, and two residents of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves (and immediate neighbours to the Project area),350 decided to file the Annulment Request. On 21 June 2012 Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 informed the Benice District Assembly of her meeting with the two neighbours and of her proposal to file the Request. Upon Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s proposals, the Assembly decided to cooperate with the two neighbours and to submit the Request to the Municipal Court of Prague, seeking annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, in order to \"prevent the realization of the [Project] or at least to minimize its scale.\"351\n\nTopi\u010dov\u00e1 WS I, para. 38; Minutes of the Benice District Assembly, 21 June 2012, **C-75**; Resolution of the Benice District Assembly, 21 June 2012, **C-76**.\n\nResolution of the Benice District Assembly, 21 June 2012, **C-76**.\n\n378.\n\nA week thereafter, on 28 June 2012, the Annulment Request against the City of Prague was presented, seeking the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 on grounds of substantive and procedural shortcomings.352 In particular, the complainants alleged that the Zoning Plan Change:\n\n- Did not respect the high-speed rail VR1 and the railway corridor that would run through the Project Area;353\n\n- Failed to respect protected natural areas and impaired the green belt surrounding Prague;354\n\n- Created a new zone of supra-local significance, which had no support in the Prague Spatial Development Principles;355\n\n- Defined a new developable area, without sufficient assessment of the need for new construction zones according to Section 55(3) of the Building Act 2006;356\n\n- Was incompatible with the case law of the Supreme Administrative Court;357\n\n- Was in conflict with the requirements of two Authorities (the Regional Organizer of Prague Integrated Transport and the Railway Infrastructure Administration);358\n\n- The allocation of Change Z 1294 from wave 06 to wave 07 was illegal;359\n\n- The Project did not properly reflect the environmental impact assessment;360\n\n- It conflicted with the nature park Botic-Mil\u00ed\u010dov;361 and\n\n- It contravened the law on protection against noise pollution and the law on protection of farmland.362\n\nJudgment of the Prague Supreme Administrative Court, 6 Aos 2/2013, dated February 26, 2014, **C-95**, p. 1.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 3.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 4.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 4.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 5.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 5.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 6.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 6.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 7.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 7.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 7.\n\n379.\n\nProjekt Sever was invited to take part in the proceedings through a notification sent by the Municipal Court on 25 July 2012. However, by the time Projekt Sever attempted to take part in the proceedings in March 2013, the deadline had already passed, and the Court denied Projekt Sever's request to participate.363\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 29. (See also paras. 406-408 *infra).*\n\n380.\n\nThe City of Prague, as respondent in the annulment action, replied and opposed the arguments made by the complainants.364\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, pp. 8-10.\n\nDecision of the Municipal Court\n-------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nThe Municipal Court reviewed the case, and on 26 April 2013 issued the Annulment Decision, finding that the Zoning Plan Change (Change Z 1294/07) should be annulled, because\n\n- it had been issued in contravention of the law and\n\n- lacked proper reasoning.365\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 28.\n\n382.\n\nThe Municipal Court held that the Zoning Plan Change \"was issued in contravention of the law\", because:\n\n- Change Z 1294/07 conflicted with Prague's Special Development Principles;366\n\n- The Boti\u010d-Mil\u00ed\u010dov nature park was affected by Change Z 1294/07 and it had been established as a \"construction freeze\" area;367\n\n- Change Z 1294/07 created a new developable area, but failed to demonstrate that the already delimited developable areas could not be used and it was, thus, in violation of the Building Act;368\n\n- The area subject to Change Z 1294/07 was a \"zone of supra-local significance\", since it affected more than one Municipality, and therefore the re-zoning required the amendment of the Spatial Development Principles (and not just the zoning plan);369 and\n\n- Change Z 1294/07 did not demonstrate its compliance with the Prague-Bene\u0161ov-\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice railway corridor, established both in the Spatial Development Policy and Spatial Development Principles.370\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, pp. 19-20.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 23.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 24.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, pp. 22-23.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 19.\n\n383.\n\nThe Court additionally determined that the proceedings had been procedurally flawed, because the transfer from \"wave 06\" to \"wave 07\" had not been properly publicised.371\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, pp. 26-27.\n\nDecision of the Prague Supreme Administrative Court\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nInitially, the Mayor of Prague, Mr. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hude\u010dek, stated publicly that the City of Prague would not file a cassation complaint to the Prague Supreme Administrative Court.372 However, the City did eventually file a cassation complaint,373 which was dismissed by the Supreme Administrative Court one year later, on 26 February 2014, thus confirming the annulment of the Zoning Change.374\n\n\"Sebastian Pawloski not allowed to build in Benice\", E15.cz News, 2 May 2013, **C-78**.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Supreme Administrative Court, 6 Aos 2/2013, 26 February 2014, **C-95**.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Supreme Administrative Court, 6 Aos 2/2013, 26 February 2014, **C-95**.\n\nB. **Decision**\n---------------\n\n385.\n\nUnder Czech law, the approval of a zoning change in Prague entails a long and democratic administrative process, divided into several consecutive steps, which culminates in a Measure of General Nature adopted by the Prague City Assembly (the highest political body, elected by the citizens of Prague).375 But this political decision is not final: it is subject to review by the Courts, which are authorised to scrutinise the procedure and the content in order to safeguard that no breach of law has been committed.\n\nSee paras. 55-60 *supra.*\n\n386.\n\nThis is precisely what happened in the present case: the Zoning Plan Change was approved by Prague\u2019s City Assembly. Thereafter, two private individuals, owners of properties directly affected by the Project, and the District of Benice, the Borough where the Project was located, filed a challenge against the approval before the Municipal Court. The District was duly authorised to participate by a decision passed by the District Assembly - its highest political body.376 In due course, the Municipal Court issued its judgment, accepting that the complainants had proper standing to file the case, and, on the merits, finding that the Zoning Plan Change should be annulled\n\n- because it had been issued in contravention of Czech law and,\n\n- furthermore, because it lacked proper reasoning.377\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER I, paras. 63-64.\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 28.\n\n387.\n\nThe first instance decision of the Municipal Court was eventually confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\nThe judgments do not infringe Article 4 of the BIT ...\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nClaimants do not contend that the judgments of the Municipal Court and of the Supreme Administrative Court constitute a denial of justice. Absent an allegation of denial of justice, the Zoning Plan Change must be deemed properly annulled, and the judgments rendered by the Municipal Court and by the Supreme Administrative Court cannot, and do not, constitute a breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n... nor does the decision of the District to file the Annulment Request\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nThe decision by the District of Benice to file the Annulment Request does not result in a violation of the BIT either.\n\n390.\n\nThe system of checks and balances developed by Czech law worked as any investor could and should have expected: the political decision of the Prague City Assembly was conditional upon review as to its legality by the Czech Courts. Any aggrieved party had the right to request such review. Two affected citizens plus the District of Benice did so. The District acted under the instruction of its highest organ, the Assembly; it exercised its legal right to challenge the Zoning Plan Change, and it did so adhering to proper administrative procedure.\n\n391.\n\n*Qui iure suo utitur neminem laedit.*378\n\nHe who uses a right injures no one.\n\nC. **Claimants\u2019 counterarguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nClaimants make two counterarguments.\n\na. **First counterargument**\n----------------------------\n\n393.\n\nClaimants argue that Benice\u2019s decision to file the Annulment Request in an attempt entirely to prevent the residential development of the Project Area was an arbitrary act, a personal retaliation of Mayor Topi\u010dova, that inflicted damage on the investor without serving any purpose;379 legal process was used for a purpose for which it was not intended, in violation of the FET standard.380\n\nC-PHB, paras. 103-110.\n\nC-PHB, para. 104, referring to *Tecmed,* **CL-17**, para. 154; *Frontier Petroleum,* **CL-21**, para. 300; See also C-II, paras. 253-262.\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by that argument.\n\n395.\n\n*Pro memoria:* in 2002 the Districts of Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, upon approval of their respective District Assemblies, had initiated the administrative procedure for the Zoning Plan Change. Eight years later, in 2010, the procedure had culminated in political approval by the Prague City Assembly. The decision of the District Assembly of Benice, which authorised the filing of the Annulment Request, was adopted in June 2012 - ten years after the initial decision to proceed. Since District Assemblies are elected democratically, it is likely that the composition of the Benice Assembly had undergone significant changes between the initial decision to proceed and the final decision to seek annulment of the Zoning Plan Change.\n\n396.\n\nClaimants say that the decision to file the Annulment Request was a personal decision of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, adopted as a retaliation for Claimants\u2019 refusal to pay the additional sums that she had sought to extract from them.\n\n397.\n\nIf this were indeed the case, such conduct could constitute a breach of the FET standard enshrined in Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n398.\n\nThere are, however, three reasons which undermine Claimants\u2019 argument:\n\n- First, the decision to file the Annulment Request was taken by the democratic organ of the District of Benice, its Assembly, not by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 singlehandedly; there is no evidence that the Assembly was aware of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to extract funds from the developer and there is no evidence that the Assembly\u2019s motives were to retaliate against the investor;\n\n- Second, the Assembly justified its decision with the following arguments:\n\n\"To prevent the execution of the submitted Benice Residential Complex project or at least to minimise its scale to a level that will not constitute a significant traffic growth in the area, will not disrupt aesthetic and natural features of value of the Boti\u010d-Mil\u00ed\u010dov nature park, and will not be an urbanistically and socially disproportionate intervention in the development of Prague \u2014 Benice borough.\"381\n\nThe justification rings true. The construction of a new, very large, housing estate is often an unwelcome development for existing home-owners, who fear a deterioration of the environment and a reduction in the quality of public services;\n\n- Third, the subsequent judgments rendered by the Courts retroactively justified the District\u2019s decision: the Zoning Plan Change was indeed held to be illegal and lacking in proper reasoning, as the District had been claiming.\n\nResolution of the Benice District Assembly, 21 June 2012, **C-76**.\n\nb. **Second counterargument**\n-----------------------------\n\n399.\n\nClaimants submit a second counterargument.\n\n400.\n\nClaimants say that even if the Tribunal were to find that Benice had a legitimate reason to oppose the Project, the filing of an Annulment Request should still be considered a disproportionate measure in light of available alternatives (such as seeking to reduce the scope of the Project),382 and was thus a violation of the FET standard.383 Further, since Benice acted to destroy Claimants\u2019 investment without providing any advance notice, this also violated the FET standard\u2019s transparency requirement.384\n\nC-PHB, para. 106.\n\nC-PHB, para. 106, referring to *Watkins Holdings,* **CL-112**, para. 601; *SolEs Badajoz,* **CL-114**, para. 328.\n\nC-PHB, para. 107, referring to *Glencore,* **CL-113**, para. 1448.\n\n401.\n\nClaimants rely on the opinion of their legal expert, Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1. In her second report, Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1 says that Benice could have used any of the many rights that city Districts have to object to, or at least influence, the scale of a building project:385 Benice did not comment on or object to the Zoning Plan Change,386 thus missing several opportunities to influence the scale of the Project and in 2011, it did not even object to the increase in the density coefficient. Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1 also suggests387 that Benice could have limited its request to the annulment of the increase in the density coefficient, without asking for the annulment of the totality of the Zoning Plan Change.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, paras. 46- 66.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 66.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 66.\n\n402.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 contradicted Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1\u2019s assertions. She explained that in her view, the only way to prevent the impact of the Project on the Benice borough was to file for the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change in its totality; if the Zoning Plan Change remained in force, and the permits process was authorised to commence, Benice would have had no opportunity to minimise the Project\u2019s impact on the municipality and its inhabitants388:\n\n\"MS TOPI\u010cOV\u00c1: Because we did not manage to negotiate a reduction in the size of the project to a level that would be acceptable to us as the borough, we were looking for a solution how to cancel the project. [...]\n\nPROF DASSER: [...] Now, I just heard you say that your goal was to prevent the project. What was the goal when you decided to annul the filed lawsuit?\n\nMS TOPI\u010cOV\u00c1: I think I answered the question. We did not manage to reduce the scope that would be acceptable to our municipality.\n\nPROF DASSER: So, at the end of paragraph 29, what you really wanted to say was that the consensual goal was now to prevent the development, is that what you are now saying?\n\nMS TOPI\u010cOV\u00c1: Yes, to prevent the size of the project. We did not find any other way.\"\n\nHT 731:16-732:18 (Topi\u010dov\u00e1, Cross).\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1\u2019s conclusion that the District could have been more vocal in its opposition, and that alternative courses of action may have been available, such that the challenge could have been limited to certain aspects of the Project. But these hypothetical alternatives cannot detract from an undisputed fact: the Zoning Plan Change did indeed breach Czech law, as confirmed by the decisions of the Courts. The District\u2019s decision to challenge it was a decision taken in observance of proper procedures and in conformity with the rule of law. Such a decision (or a proper and regular judgment ruling upon it) cannot be labelled as disproportionate, arbitrary or unreasonable, or in breach of the FET standard.\n\nAdvance notice\n--------------\n\n404.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Claimant\u2019s subsidiary argument that Benice failed to provide advance notice, in violation of the FET standard\u2019s transparency requirement.\n\n405.\n\nProjekt Sever was in due course informed, through a notification sent by the Municipal Court on 25 July 2012, that the District had filed the Annulment Request. However, by the time Projekt Sever attempted to participate in the proceedings in March 2013, the applicable legal deadline to appear had lapsed, and the Court denied Projekt Sever\u2019s request.389 Projekt Sever challenged the decision of the Municipal Court, but on 4 December 2014 the Constitutional Court confirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s decision and dismissed the complaint.390\n\nJudgment of the Prague Municipal Court, no. 9A 113/2012, dated 26 April 2013, **C-94**, p. 29.\n\nConstitutional Court Resolution, 4 December 2014, **R-15**.\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no violation of the FET standard. Public authorities are not under an obligation to provide advance notice of their intention to launch lawsuits which affect protected investors; what due process requires is that the respondent in a lawsuit be properly notified, and that the respondent be afforded a reasonable time within which to appear.\n\n407.\n\nThese requirements were met: when the Annulment Request was filed, Projekt Sever was duly notified through the Court. For reasons which are not to be imputed to Respondent, Projekt Sever then failed to appear within the time frame established by Czech procedural law. Its subsequent request, filed once the time period for appearance had already lapsed, was denied. Projekt Sever appealed the decision up to the Constitutional Court, but it was unsuccessful.\n\n408.\n\nClaimants are not submitting that the decision of the Constitutional Court implied a denial of justice.\n\n409.\n\nIn the absence of any such allegation, much less any evidence of a denial of justice, the Tribunal concludes that there is no breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n**3.3 M****ayor** **H****ude\u010dek****\u2019****s opposition to re****-****procurement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the City of Prague could have re-procured the annulled Zoning Plan Change promptly, there being no substantive reason why the deficiencies identified by the Court in its Annulment Decision could not have been remedied; all that was required was the drafting of a more detailed substantiation and obtaining an approval by the City Assembly.391 Instead, Claimants say that Mayor Hude\u010dek did not advance the re-procurement during his term in office, and his conduct was unreasonable and arbitrary, in breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 116-117.\n\n411.\n\nRespondent denies that Mayor Hude\u010dek engaged in improper conduct and avers that he followed standard procedure in addressing the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change.392\n\nR-PHB, para. 105; R-II, paras. 130-134.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal will again summarise the proven facts relevant to this issue [**A.**]. It will then take a decision [**B.**] leading to its conclusion that Claimants\u2019 counterarguments should be dismissed [**C.**].\n\nA. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n413.\n\nTwo months after the Cassation Decision, Mr. Pawlowski (representing Projekt Sever) sent a letter to Mayor Hude\u010dek. He stated that the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change had caused massive damage to Projekt Sever (quantified at a minimum of CZK 2.5 billion) and he requested that the matter be included in the agenda of the next session of the City Assembly.393 Projekt Sever sent another letter in May 2014 to Prague\u2019s Zoning Plan Division, citing the City\u2019s obligations under Section 55(3) of Building Act and requesting that the City Assembly continue the process of re-procuring Zoning Plan Change Z-1294/07.394\n\nLetter from Projekt Sever to Mayor of the City of Prague, 7 April 2014, **C-80**.\n\nLetter from Projekt Sever to the Zoning Plan Division of the City of Prague, 19 May 2014, **C-81**.\n\n414.\n\nA few days later, on 19 May 2014, Mayor Hude\u010dek reacted, informing Projekt Sever that Section 55(3) did not apply to this case and that the only possible course of action was the filing of a new application for a zoning plan change.395 Mayor Hude\u010dek explained that any such instigation of a zoning plan change could originate from the original applicants (in this case, the two Municipal Districts), but he also noted that if Projekt Sever applied for the Zoning Plan Change itself, discussion of the Zoning Plan Change could be commenced, but it would only apply to Projekt Sever.396\n\nLetter from Mayor of Prague to Projekt Sever, 19 May 2014, **C-82**.\n\nLetter from Mayor of Prague to Projekt Sever, 19 May 2014, **C-82**.\n\nMeeting at the Spatial Development Division\n-------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nMr. Nov\u00e1cek, a Municipal lawyer working for the City Spatial Development Division, participated in a meeting held around the same time, involving Mr. Pawlowski, his lawyers, and civil servants from that Division.397 Mr. Nov\u00e1cek describes the meeting in the following terms:\n\n\"I did not sense any effort on the part of Prague City Hall to support the project or the zoning plan change itself: it was kind of like 'it\u2019s happened, nothing we can do about it\u2019. In response to an enquiry from Mr Pawlowski, a reply was sent saying that the annulment of the change automatically restored the previous state of regulation. In other cases where a zoning plan change was annulled, a possible solution was proactively offered; only in this case that did not happen. The only option the City of Prague offered Mr Pawlowski at this meeting was that he himself could ask for a new zoning plan application to be processed.\"398\n\nNov\u00e1cek WS, para. 18.\n\nNov\u00e1cek WS, para. 21.\n\n416.\n\nMr Nov\u00e1\u010dek recalled that this treatment contrasted with that granted to other investors in equivalent situations:\n\n\"I remember that many equivalent meetings were also held with other investors if zoning plan changes or modifications were annulled by a court. We usually discussed the situation that had arisen with the investor and offered a solution, which consisted in a re-submission of the application, with the understanding that in the new processing of the application we would eliminate the errors identified by the court as the grounds for annulment.\"399\n\nNov\u00e1cek WS, para. 19.\n\n417.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Mr. Nov\u00e1\u010dek was questioned about what would normally happen when a zoning plan change was annulled by a Court. He stated that:\n\n\"[T]here would be a meeting with the investor, the land owner. It would be explained to him what was the cause of the annulment of the zoning plan change, what are the reasons, and he would be asked whether he wants to insist on the change. If he says yes, then we take a step or two back; we go back to the point which is not covered by the decision of the court; what was annulled would be processed again, and the change could be adopted again.\"400\n\nHT 410:15-24.\n\n418.\n\nMr. Nov\u00e1\u010dek clarified what he found to be \"non-standard\" about the procedure applied to Projekt Sever\u2019s case. Rather than going back to the last valid step in the zoning process and resuming from there, Mr. Nov\u00e1\u010dek explained:\n\n\"[I]n this specific case it was requested that Mr Pawlowski make a new application himself, and the change would be reprocessed from the very beginning again.\"401\n\nHT 391:18-22.\n\nDiscussion at the City Assembly Meeting of 29 May 2014\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n419.\n\nAt the meeting of the Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2014 (10 days after Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s letter), Assembly member Dr. Bla\u017eek asked Mayor Hude\u010dek about the delay in bringing the matter of the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change before the Assembly, noting the potential damages that the City of Prague was facing.402 (To recall, Dr. Bla\u017eek was an important figure in the \"ODS\" party, a political rival of Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s \"TOP09\" party403).\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, May 29, 2014, **C-96**, pp. 1-2.\n\nHudecek WS I, para. 16; Tomoszkova WS I, para. 78.\n\n420.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek responded by asserting that\n\n\"[t]he error is not in the administrative procedure [of the zoning change]; the error is that the Prague City Assembly ever approved it.\"404\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 2.\n\nAllegations of improper conduct\n-------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek added that there had been improper conduct in obtaining the Zoning Plan Change: the Zoning Plan Division initially had a negative opinion, and undue pressure had been exerted to cause it to change its opinion. He also told the Assembly that files relating to the approval of the Zoning Plan Change had been sent to the Police:405\n\n\"A zoning plan change was approved that conflicted with the Spatial Development Principles at the time. The Institute of Urban Planning and Development, then known as the Development Section, did not consent, but director Votava subsequently changed the opinion to an affirmative one. That is documented. That was part of the 'Blue Files\u2019 and was sent to the police. The Railway Infrastructure Administration, as a concerned state authority, did not consent. ROPIT did not consent. The Zoning Plan Division did not consent, but then, under pressure from Councillor Manhart, had to change its opinion, but even so the Prague City Assembly, which you were a part of, approved it on 26 March 2010.\"406 [Emphasis added].\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 2.\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 2.\n\n422.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek further insinuated that there had been criminality involved in the process. Noting the City of Prague\u2019s cassation appeal against the Municipal Court\u2019s first instance decision, Mayor Hude\u010dek stated:\n\n\"It is not true that we then did nothing. The City of Prague then filed a cassation complaint against it for the very reason that the city could say 'we did something\u2019 in the event of the kind of litigation that followed. I cannot say that I personally agree with the cassation complaint. Not a bit. After what I read, it would be quite enough for me if someone was locked up, not that it was discussed further. I remind you that the Prague City Assembly that voted on it is the main argument.\"407 [Emphasis added].\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 3.\n\n423.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek also referred to \"legal opinions\" supporting his view that the City had no responsibility to act, and finally added:\n\n\"For that reason, if I were to summarise, the city did everything to ensure that any court fine or arbitration was basically out of the question. At the same time Mr Pawlowski wants us, as assembly members, to immediately start to issue a new zoning plan change. To tell you the truth, having acquainted myself with it and after what I read here, I personally cannot imagine that I personally would initiate that change. The change can be initiated by a city borough, however. We have received no such instigation, so I think that the Prague City Assembly literally has no work to do at this moment.\"408\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, **C-96**, p. 3.\n\nDiscussion at the City Assembly Meeting of 19 June 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nOne month later, at the 19 June 2014 City Assembly meeting, Dr. Bla\u017eek once again brought up the annulment of Change Z-1294/07. He proposed that the City restart the procurement process, and he noted the potential future risks that the City Assembly members could face if they did not act. Dr. Bla\u017eek proposed placing the matter on the agenda for full discussion.409\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 19 June 2014, **C-97**, pp. 1-2; Tomoszkov\u00e1 ER I, para. 78.\n\n425.\n\nIn response to Dr. Bla\u017eek\u2019s concerns, Mayor Hude\u010dek replied that:\n\n\"If part of a zoning plan is annulled and there is no valid zoning plan in the given part of the city or territory, the assembly has to act without delay. That means that we have here the opinion of lawyers from the zoning plan division headed by Mrs. Engineer Cvetlerov\u00e1. Based on this opinion I think that we really don\u2019t have to deal with this situation now and consequently I won\u2019t submit the prints either. I consequently will not second Doctor Blae\u017eek\u2019s motion.\"410 [Emphasis added].\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 19 June 2014, **C-97**, p. 2.\n\n426.\n\nDr. Bla\u017eek responded to Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s remarks, noting that he was:\n\n\"[G]lad that you say here that they are lawyers from the zoning plan division, which is great, because four years ago the same lawyers, the same division, guaranteed the Assembly here that everything is *de lege*, that everything is in order, and when the Assembly voted on the change four years ago, we were persuaded and it was also drawn up by this division, these lawyers, and I guess the same people, when we were told that it is absolutely in order. Today, four years later, we are in a situation where it has been annulled and so we are repeatedly being called on by the investor to act.\"411\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 19 June 2014, **C-97**, p. 3.\n\n427.\n\nNevertheless, Mayor Hude\u010dek refused Dr. Bla\u017eek\u2019s motion to place the matter on the agenda for discussion. Additionally, Mayor Hude\u010dek did not correct any of the statements made at the 29 May 2014 meeting.\n\nDiscussion at the City Assembly Meeting of 11 September 2014\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThree months later, at the 11 September 2014 meeting of the City Assembly, Dr. Bla\u017eek accused Mayor Hude\u010dek of being motivated by personal *animus* against Mr. Pawlowski, stating:\n\n\"Perhaps I even understand that you don\u2019t like Mr Pawlowski. Personal feelings are a fundamental driving force of your actions, but that\u2019s all right. You will happily play it down in six months\u2019 time [...]\"412\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 11 September 2014, **C-98**, p. 2.\n\n429.\n\nDr. Bla\u017eek also accused Mayor Hude\u010dek of having previously misled the City Assembly by relying on a legal assessment which, he said, did not exist, and by having claimed that the City Assembly acted under pressure from Councilor Manhart - who did not even know about the Assembly meeting, nor the issues being discussed.413\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 11 September 2014, **C-98**, p. 2.\n\n430.\n\nFinally, Dr. Bla\u017eek questioned Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s prior statements claiming reliance on a legal opinion. Dr. Bla\u017eek asked Mayor Hude\u010dek:\n\n\"[E]xplain to me, please, when you said in June 2014 that it is evident, it is clear, on the basis of legal assessments, why you didn\u2019t submit a single legal assessment. It\u2019s because you didn\u2019t have any; you had the opinion of the zoning plan division, that\u2019s all right. But I am just putting it out there and reminding you that that was the same division that submitted its opinion to the assembly that [the zoning plan change] can be voted for and that it is in order.\"414 [Emphasis added].\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 11 September 2014, **C-98**, p. 2.\n\n431.\n\nIn reply, Mayor Hude\u010dek noted that the land in question belonged to Mr. Pawlowski and he alleged that Mr. Pawlowski was trying to force the Assembly to take up the issue of the re-procurement.\n\n432.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek insisted that he had commissioned a legal opinion, stating:\n\n\"So the legal opinion is here. That means that it is an opinion by the law firm of \u010calfa, Barto\u0161\u00edk a partne\u0159i. [...] The only thing that was annulled is the discussion of a certain zoning plan change. And here this assessment by the law firm that originated in the zoning plan division - it therefore does not follow from a simple linguistic interpretation of the said provision that the Assembly\u2019s obligation to decide without delay on the procurement of the zoning plan or a change thereto and on its substance applies to the case of the annulment of a change to a zoning plan or a part thereof.\"415 [Emphasis added].\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 11 September 2014, **C-98**, pp. 2-3.\n\n433.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek then once again urged the Assembly members not to give in to pressure from Mr. Pawlowski, suggesting that all of Prague was against the Zoning Plan Change, and questioning Dr. Bla\u017eek\u2019s motivations for raising the issue:\n\n\"So, ladies and gentlemen, I recommend not yielding to the pressure from the investor who is seeking the annulment of a zoning plan change against which that entire part of Prague protested. And of course I understand Doctor Bla\u017eek, who is probably somehow linked to this investor, but the law and the assessment state clearly that the necessity does not follow.\"416 [Emphasis added].\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 11 September 2014, **C-98**, pp. 2-3.\n\nProjekt Sever files a complaint, alleging abuse of office\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nOn 22 October 2014, Projekt Sever filed a criminal complaint (which was investigated by the \"Corruption and Financial Crime Detection Unit of the Czech Police\") against Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, Mayor Hude\u010dek, and other relevant persons. The complaint alleged, *inter alia*, conspiracy and abuse of office by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and Mayor Hude\u010dek in seeking to annul Change Z-1294/07 and blocking the construction of Claimants\u2019 planned Residential Complex.417\n\nC-I, paras. 184-185; R-I, para. 171; Hude cek WS I, para. 18. (The Tribunal notes that the Complaint itself has not been submitted as evidence.)\n\n435.\n\nUltimately, the police investigation did not proceed. Projekt Sever included in its Constitutional Court challenge a complaint over the discontinuation of the police investigation; the Constitutional Court, however, found all of Projekt Sever\u2019s complaints inadmissible.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nIn the meantime, Mayor Coller of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves had approached the Ministry of Regional Development, requesting a legal opinion regarding the annulment of Zoning Plan Change Z-1294/07. The Ministry reacted on 27 October 2014, with a letter addressed to Mayor Coller, in which it explained the Ministry\u2019s position:418\n\n- First, the letter states that if a zoning plan change is annulled, the previous zoning plan is applied;419\n\n- Second, the letter explains that if the annulment is made because the proposed change lacks reasoning, it is possible to remedy such shortcoming; the same applies to procedural defects; if the annulment is for substantive reasons, the original project will have to be modified to expunge the offending elements;420\n\n- Third, Section 55(3) of the Building Act \"imposes an obligation on the Municipal Assembly to act in these extraordinary situations\";421 it is the right and the duty of the Assembly to assess the situation as it stands after the annulment and adopt the proper decision, which must be duly substantiated;422\n\n- Fourth, the Ministry finally explains that it cannot \"be ruled out that a Municipal Assembly will decide, having weighed up all facts, that the state of affairs after the annulment of the change is satisfactory and no change will be made.\"423\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development regarding Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development regarding Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p. 2.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development regarding Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p. 3.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development regarding Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p. 3.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development regarding Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p. 4.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development regarding Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p. 4.\n\n437.\n\nSumming up, the interpretation given by the Ministry to existing Czech legislation was that, upon annulment of a zoning plan change, the matter must be submitted to the relevant Municipal Assembly, which must assess the situation and adopt a reasoned decision:\n\n- to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change (amending the shortcomings established in the annulment judgment); or\n\n- to confirm the annulment, in which case the previous zoning rules will apply.\n\n438.\n\nThree months thereafter, in December 2014, the Ministry issued a \"Methodological Recommendation\" regarding zoning plan changes,424 which confirmed that the proper interpretation of Section 55(3) of the Building Act requires that, when a zoning plan change is annulled, \"the municipal assembly decides without delay on the procurement of the zoning plan or of the change and on its substance.\"425\n\nMethodological Recommendation of the Ministry of Regional Development, December 2014, **H-3**, p. 2.\n\nMethodological Recommendation of the Ministry of Regional Development, December 2014, **H-3**, p. 2.\n\nThe re-procurement is finally tabled\n------------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nIn November 2014, Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s term of office ended. At some unspecified time, probably when Mayor Hude\u010dek was no longer Mayor, the City initiated the formal procedure for re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change. The decision whether to re-procure or not was finally placed on the agenda of the Prague City Assembly meeting of 14 April 2015, when the Assembly decided to reject the re-procurement as will be analysed separately in section [**3.4**] below).\n\nB. **Decision**\n---------------\n\n440.\n\nThe final Cassation Decision, annulling the Zoning Plan Change, was issued on 26 February 2014. The re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was debated (and dismissed) by the Prague City Assembly more than one year thereafter, on 14 April 2015. The Tribunal must decide whether Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s initial reluctance even to debate the re-procurement, based on an interpretation of Section 55(3) of the Building Act, which led to a delay of more than one year, was conduct that can be considered unreasonable, arbitrary or in contravention of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\nSection 55(3) of the Building Act\n---------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nPartial or total annulment by the judiciary of a zoning plan change approved by a Municipality is a frequent occurrence in the Czech Republic.426 The Building Act has a specific provision, establishing the principles which a Municipal authority must follow in such cases. The precise wording of the Building Act has changed several times over the past ten years. From 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017, Section 55(3) of the Building Act provided as follows:\n\n\"If a part of a zoning plan is annulled or it cannot serve as a ground for a decision pursuant to Section 54 paras. 4 and 5, the municipal assembly shall without delay decide on the procurement of the zoning plan or its change and its content. [...] If an entire zoning plan is annulled, the process of procuring shall continue from the last action, which was not challenged by the annulment.\"427 [Emphasis added]\n\n\"Zoning Changes affected by a court decision\", City of Prague, **R-60**.\n\nSection 55 of the Building Act, wording effective from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2017, (unofficial translation), **R-58**.\n\n442.\n\nProjekt Sever argued that Section 55(3) required the Prague City Assembly to take up the question of re-procurement without delay. That interpretation was initially contested by Mayor Hude\u010dek and by the Municipality, which considered that Section 55(3) was only applicable to zoning plans annulled in part or in their entirety, but not to the annulment of zoning plan changes.428 This construction was based on a literal reading of the law - the Parties\u2019 legal experts agree that from a textual perspective, Section 55(3) does not explicitly refer to the annulment of a zoning plan change.429\n\nLetter from Mayor of Prague to Projekt Sever, 19 May 2014, **C-82**; R-PHB, para. 63.\n\nHT 1004:17-21. (Tomoszkov\u00e1, Cross) (\"Mr. Silva Romero: [...] I don't like to put these types of questions, but the word 'change\u2019 that was added to the last -- the word change was only added to the last sentence of Article 55(3) in 2018, correct? Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1: Yes. That is correct.\"). See also HT 933:10-950:14 (Tribunal\u2019s questions to the legal experts).\n\n443.\n\nMr. Boh\u00e1\u010d, who was the Director of Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s office, explained in his witness statement the background to Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s opinion: while evaluating Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s case, the Mayor\u2019s office had approached the Spatial Development Department. It had received a written opinion, explaining that Section 55(3) of the Building Act dealt with a situation in which a part of a zoning plan had been annulled, but it did not provide for a situation, as in the case of the Project, where a change to an existing zoning plan had been annulled.430 Both Mayor Hude\u010dek431 and Mr. Boh\u00e1\u010d432 aver that this was the regular practice in dealing with zoning changes.433\n\nBoh\u00e1\u010d WS, para. 48.\n\nHT 837:17-839:23 (Hude\u010dek Cross)\n\nHT 586:2-588:7 (Boh\u00e1\u010d Cross, questioned by the President of the Tribunal).\n\nR-PHB, para. 105; R-II, paras. 130-134.\n\n444.\n\nTo settle the different interpretations of the law, Mayor Coller of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves approached the Ministry of Regional Development and asked for a legal opinion regarding the annulment of Zoning Plan Change Z-1294/07. In October 2014, the Ministry issued its decision, supporting Claimants\u2019 interpretation.434\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development regarding Section 55(3) of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**.\n\nThe City changes tack\n---------------------\n\n445.\n\nThe City accepted the Ministry\u2019s interpretation, abandoned its prior position and initiated the procedure for the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change. In April 2015, the decision whether to accept or to dismiss the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was submitted to a vote by the City Assembly.\n\n446.\n\nSince the City eventually instigated the procedure for re-procuring the Zoning Plan Change, the complaint that Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s conduct deprived Projekt Sever of the right to have the Zoning Plan Change re-procured cannot be sustained. The only outstanding question is whether the delay which occurred in instigating the re-procurement could give rise to a breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\nDelay\n-----\n\n447.\n\nThere was indeed a period of 14 months between the Cassation Decision (26 February 2014), and the decision of the City Assembly on re-procurement (14 April 2015). But there are circumstances which justify this delay: in all jurisdictions, zoning and re-zoning decisions are lengthy procedures, requiring that different authorities with sometimes conflicting mandates canvass and analyse the opinions of stakeholders and that environmental, social and political factors be weighed.\n\n448.\n\nIn the present case, the Zoning Plan Change had been initiated by the Districts in 2006. It had been approved by the Assembly in 2010 and annulled by the judiciary in 2014. It took Mr. Pawlowski two months following the annulment to send his first communication to the Municipality, requesting re-procurement. And it was October 2014 before the Ministry for Regional Development informed the City that its interpretation was wrong, and that Section 55(3) should also be applied to the annulment of zoning changes. In December 2014, the Ministry finally issued a \"Methodological Recommendation\" regarding zoning plan changes, which confirmed the proper interpretation of Section 55(3) of the Building Act.435 The decision of the Assembly was issued four months thereafter.\n\nHT 293:25-294:2 (Coller, Cross) (\"MR SILVA ROMERO: And it is my understanding, Mr Coller, that you requested that opinion from the Ministry after the annulment of the zoning change that concerned Mr Pawlowski's project, yes or no? MR COLLER: Yes[\u2026]\").\n\n449.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the delay in submitting the re-procurement to the City Assembly was not so unreasonable as to constitute a breach of the BIT and an international delict of the Czech Republic.\n\nC. **Claimants\u2019 counterarguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nIn reaching that decision the Tribunal has considered Claimants\u2019 three counterarguments and rejected them for the following reasons.\n\na. **First counterargument**\n----------------------------\n\n451.\n\nFirst, Claimants argue that Mayor Hude\u010dek, during his entire term in office, which ended in November 2014, prevented the City from moving forward with the re-procurement;436 he refused Claimants\u2019 repeated requests to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change, even suggesting that Claimants should start the process all over again and from the very beginning.437\n\nC-PHB, para. 118.\n\nC-PHB, para. 118.\n\n452.\n\nThe Tribunal sees things differently.\n\n453.\n\nIt is true that Mayor Hude\u010dek supported a literal interpretation of Section 55(3) of the Building Act, which eventually was abandoned by the Municipality, upon the recommendation of the Ministry. It is also true that the Mayor left office in November 2014, at a time when the re-procurement had still to be tabled before the Assembly. But from the point of view of the international responsibility of the Czech Republic, what is relevant is not the personal opinion of a single officer, but the fact that, within a period of time which cannot be labelled as unreasonable, the City of Prague finally submitted the re-procurement for approval by the City Assembly.\n\nb. **Second counterargument**\n-----------------------------\n\n454.\n\nSecond, Claimants also assert that Mayor Hude\u010dek acted out of personal opposition to the Zoning Plan Change and hostility to Mr. Pawlowski438 and made tendentious statements to the Assembly.439\n\nC-PHB, para. 121.\n\nHT 16:3-17; 655:1-657:22.\n\n455.\n\nThe evidence does show that Mayor Hude\u010dek personally opposed the initial approval of the Zoning Plan Change and that on several occasions he made inaccurate statements before the City Assembly.\n\nPersonal opposition\n-------------------\n\n456.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Mayor Hude\u010dek personally opposed the development of the Project in general, and the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change in particular. But opinions are free: that a political representative holds the view that a certain real estate development is not in the interest of the City by itself does not give rise to an international delict of the Czech Republic.\n\nInaccurate statements\n---------------------\n\n457.\n\nDid Mayor Hude\u010dek make inaccurate statements to the City Assembly?\n\n458.\n\nAt the meeting of the Prague City Assembly on 29 May 2014, Mayor Hude\u010dek suggested that there had been improper conduct in obtaining the Zoning Plan Change and that Councillor Manhart had exercised undue pressure. He also told the Assembly that files relating to the approval of the zoning change had been sent to the Police440 and further insinuated that there had been criminality involved.441\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, p. 2, **C-96**: \"A zoning plan change was approved that conflicted with the Spatial Development Principles at the time. The Institute of Urban Planning and Development, then known as the Development Section, did not consent, but director Votava subsequently changed the opinion to an affirmative one. That is documented. That was part of the 'Blue Files' and was sent to the police. The Railway Infrastructure Administration, as a concerned state authority, did not consent. ROPIT did not consent. The Zoning Plan Division did not consent, but then, under pressure from Councillor Manhart, had to change its opinion, but even so the Prague City Assembly, which you were a part of, approved it on 26 March 2010.\" [Emphasis added].\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 29 May 2014, p. 3, **C-96**. \"It is not true that we then did nothing. The City of Prague then filed a cassation complaint against it for the very reason that the city could say 'we did something' in the event of the kind of litigation that followed. I cannot say that I personally agree with the cassation complaint. Not a bit. After what I read, it would be quite enough for me if someone was locked up, not that it was discussed further. I remind you that the Prague City Assembly that voted on it is the main argument.\" [Emphasis added].\n\n459.\n\nIn direct contradiction to his statements made before the City Assembly, Mayor Hude\u010dek later admitted that no Police investigation had actually taken place. In a letter dated 5 August 2014 addressed to Mrs. Kube\u0161ov\u00e1, a member of the Committee of Bonum Commune, Mayor Hude\u010dek explained that no representations had been made to the criminal justice authorities442 and he corrected his statement with respect to Councilor Manhart having exercised undue pressure.443\n\nLetter from the Mayor of Prague to Committee Bonum Commune, 5 August 2014, **C-93**: \"The Municipal Office of Prague did not address any submissions to the authorities responsible for criminal justice police. The Municipal Office of Prague performed an in-depth check, the outcome of which is that there is reasonable suspicion of unethical, immoral procedure, but evidence of a breach of the law was not found. Unfortunately, the problem is therefore merely ethical and political, not unlawful.\" [Emphasis added].\n\nLetter from the Mayor of Prague to Committee Bonum Commune, 5 August 2014, **C-93**: \"There was no pressure placed on officials in the matter of zoning plan change no. 1294/07 by Councillor Manhart. It was my mistake, as I erroneously mixed up his name with the name of the former councilor for spatial development in the years 2007 -2010, Martin Langmajer (ODS), when I addressed the Prague City Assembly.\"\n\n460.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mayor Hude\u010dek provided additional information: the files had in fact been sent to the police, because he had found irregularities in the documents submitted for the approval of the Zoning Plan Change. Such irregularities included multiple instances of amendments to documents which had previously been marked \"for this reason we disagree.\" The original notation had been crossed out and replaced with \"we agree\" and signed by Director Votava.444 Ultimately, however, the Police determined that there was insufficient proof of any wrongdoing and the investigation was dropped.445\n\nHT 852.\n\nHT 853-854.\n\n461.\n\nThe record seems to bear out the fact that at the 29 April 2014 Assembly meeting, Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s statements regarding the alleged illegality of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07, even if not outright false (the City had indeed sent certain files for the Police to investigate), were at least inaccurate and exaggerated (because Councillor Manhart was not involved, and no criminality was found).\n\n462.\n\nMayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s conduct cannot be lauded. There are however certain mitigating factors to consider:\n\n- The 29 April 2019 discussion in the Prague Assembly was of a political character; no specific resolution with regard to the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was tabled or discussed. The re-procurement was only put on the agenda of, and discussed in, the Assembly on 14 April 2015, almost one year thereafter (at a time when Mayor Hude\u010dek was no longer in office).\n\n- Mayor Hude\u010dek explained at the Hearing that his statements were part of a political strategy necessary to survive at the City Assembly:446\n\n\"[A]t the Assembly I act as leader of the ruling coalition, and I have to make sure that the procedure agreed, or order agreed by the coalition is maintained. So anyone, even Mr Bla\u017eek -- and if you are not a politician you may find this odd -- Mr Bla\u017eek is not saying that it should be included on the agenda; his purpose is that this is said there. If he would like to include it on the agenda he would have approached me a week earlier and we would have agreed to include on it the agenda. So on his part it is a bit of political game, and it is up to me to play this political game as well as I can. So it is quite apparent here that what I am saying here: 'Mr Bla\u017eek, you are the causer of this change being approved, in spite of the fact that here were a number of opinions saying no, this change shouldn't have been approved\u2019. And in this political game, I am smiling while I say this, even though it is quite sad, but in this political game it is much easier to beat someone over the head with this political argument, rather than bother the 65 Assembly members with expert opinions and details, when they are bored and want to get on with voting. In spite of that, when I see what I was saying, I think I actually did a good job, that there is the explanation why the reason is what we say [...].\"\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHT 845:11-846:13; See also HT 838:16-839:3.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that position to be credible. Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s stance opposing re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was in essence motivated by political considerations. He considered that the development would be detrimental to the future of the City, and he vigorously defended his position at the City Assembly, a political body, using the exaggerations and inaccuracies common in political speech. These exaggerations and inaccuracies\n\n- had no influence on the Assembly\u2019s eventual decision to dismiss the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change (a decision which was taken a year later, when Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s term had already come to an end) and\n\n- did not constitute an offence under Czech municipal law (Claimants\u2019 criminal complaint having been dismissed).\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Mayor Hude\u010dek\u2019s economies with the truth are not of such gravity as to provoke an international delict on the part of the Czech Republic.\n\nc. **Third counterargument**\n----------------------------\n\n464.\n\nFinally, Claimants make a third counterargument.\n\n465.\n\nClaimants argue that rather than following standard procedure and requesting advice from the appropriate Municipal authority, Mayor Hude\u010dek tasked a compliant law firm with generating an opinion that supported his refusal to move forward with re-procurement.447\n\nC-PHB, para. 130.\n\n466.\n\nAt the 29 May 2014 Assembly meeting, Mayor Hude\u010dek stated that he was relying on legal assessment from the law firm Calfa, Barto\u0161\u00edk a partne\u0159i. But the evidentiary record demonstrates that such legal opinion was only commissioned and issued at a much later date. A letter from the Director of the Building and Zoning Plan Division to Projekt Sever establishes that the legal opinion was commissioned on 23 June 2014 and delivered on 30 July 2014:\n\n\"[W]e are sending you a copy of the legal assessment of 30 June 2014 done by the law firm of Calfa, Barto\u0161\u00edk a partne\u0159i; [...]\n\nRe 3) the assessment was commissioned on 23 June 2014\n\nRe 4) the said assessment was handed over by employees of the law firm on 30 July 2014 (see submission stamp of the copy of the assessment).\"448 [Emphasis added].\n\nLetter from Zoning Plan Division to Projekt Sever, 31 October 2014, **C-92**, p. 1.\n\n467.\n\nThis letter confirms Dr. Bla\u017eek\u2019s final remarks directed to Mayor Hude\u010dek during an Assembly Meeting, where Dr. Bla\u017eek stated:\n\n\"You [Mayor Hude\u010dek] commissioned that legal opinion after the June Assembly session, because you didn\u2019t have one before then. That is a declaration, it is the truth, it is a statement of fact.\"449\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript, 11 September 2014, **C-98**, p. 3.\n\n468.\n\nThe record shows that Mayor Hude\u010dek made an untrue statement before the City Assembly: he referred to an outside legal opinion which had yet to be commissioned and issued.\n\n469.\n\nThe inaccuracy is to be lamented. But an incidental inaccuracy by a public authority, in a speech before a political body, which is not directly related to a protected investor or investment, does not constitute a breach by the Czech Republic of the duty to refrain from acting in an unreasonable manner, as required under Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n**3.4 T****he** **A****ssembly****\u2019****s decision not to re****-****procure**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n470.\n\nClaimants argue that the decision of the Prague City Assembly dismissing the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was unreasonable, arbitrary and disproportionate.450\n\nC-PHB, paras. 133-153.\n\n471.\n\nRespondent counters that the Assembly acted in full compliance with Czech law, without abuse or arbitrariness.451\n\nR-II, para. 208; R-PHB, para. 197.\n\n472.\n\nThe Tribunal will first make a summary of the relevant facts [**A.**], explain its decision [**B.**], and dismiss Claimants\u2019 counterarguments [**c.**].\n\nA. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n473.\n\nThe re-procurement of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 was finally placed on the agenda for the Prague City Assembly meeting of 14 April 2015. The Assembly was presented with an extensive summary of the underlying facts, including a reference to the letter of the Ministry of Regional Affairs dated 27 October 2014, and with two alternatives from which it had to choose:\n\n- to consent to continuation of the re-procurement or\n\n- to consent to its termination.452\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 5.\n\n474.\n\nDeputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd made a short introductory remark, acknowledging that the City Assembly \"could comply with the Court\u2019s recommendation\" and \"commence the procurement of the change on the basis of the Court\u2019s recommendations\", but he proposed to the Assembly that the re-procurement be dismissed.453\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 5.\n\n475.\n\nMayor Krn\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 then called for a vote.\n\n476.\n\nThe totality of the 51 members of the City Assembly members voted in favour of terminating the procurement of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 *(i.e.,* of dismissing the re-procurement); not a single member of the Assembly voted against termination or abstained.454\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 1.\n\n477.\n\nThus, on 14 April 2015, the Prague City Assembly finally terminated the procurement of Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07 and the land purchased by Projekt Sever to develop the Benice Residential Complex reverted to agricultural, forest and recreational use.\n\nB. **Decision**\n---------------\n\n478.\n\nThe issue before the Tribunal is whether the City of Prague, in deciding not to re-procure Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07, acted unreasonably or arbitrarily in breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n479.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no unreasonable or arbitrary decision, nor a breach of the FET standard.\n\n480.\n\nSection 55(3) of the Building Act - as interpreted in the 27 October 2014 letter from the Ministry of Regional Development - imposes an obligation on the Municipal Assembly to act when a zoning change plan has been annulled by the Courts;455 but the City Assembly is empowered to assess the new situation and adopt the most appropriate decision.456 As the Ministry acknowledged, it cannot \"be ruled out that a municipal assembly will decide, having weighed up all facts, that the state of affairs after the annulment of the change is satisfactory and no change will be made.\"457 The only requirement which the Assembly must meet is that its decision must be substantiated.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development re Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p.3.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development re Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p.4.\n\nOpinion of the Ministry of Regional Development re Section 55 of the Building Act, 27 October 2014, **C-99**, p.4.\n\n481.\n\nIn accordance with Section 55(3), the City of Prague Assembly, faced with the decision of the Courts to annul the Zoning Plan Change, was under an obligation to review the situation without unreasonable delay, and, after weighing up all facts, to issue a discretionary decision either re-procuring the Zoning Plan Change, with the modifications necessary to satisfy the Court ruling, or terminating the procurement. To avoid arbitrariness, the decision had to be \"duly substantiated\" or \"informed\", i.e., properly reasoned, weighing all countervailing factors.458\n\nHT 951:4-18; HT 952:19-953:6; See also HT 906:9-13.\n\n482.\n\nMr. Langmajer (who was Deputy Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and who appeared as a witness for Claimants) acknowledged that the decision of the Assembly \"can be positive or negative.\"459\n\nHT 345:15-16.\n\nProper substantiation\n---------------------\n\n483.\n\nWhen asked at the Hearing about the standard under Czech law by which a decision may be deemed to be substantiated or informed, Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1, Claimants\u2019 legal expert, referred the Tribunal to her legal opinion.460 It states that the Assembly was required to:\n\n\"(1) [...] assess the nature of the defect for which the zoning change was annulled, to evaluate the impacts of the City Court\u2019s decision on the conceptual design of the Prague Land Use Plan, and to consider its consequences, including its impact on the legitimate expectations of any affected persons. [...]\"461\n\nHT 951:6-952:10.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER I, para. 77.\n\n484.\n\nDr. Kade\u010dka, Respondent\u2019s legal expert, agreed that the decision of the Assembly had to be informed, but pointed out that there is no \"specific process for this,\"462 a statement which Claimants\u2019 expert did not contradict.\n\nHT 953:2-3.\n\n485.\n\nIn the present case, the decision of the City Assembly to terminate the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change included the following reasoning:\n\n\"- assent to termination\n\n- one of the applicants for the change filed an action against the issued zoning plan change and expresses no interest in new procurement after its annulment by the court\n\n- the new procurement would take place against the will of the relevant city borough as the party that filed the action for the annulment of the zoning plan change\n\n- the substantiation of the court judgment is of such a nature that the outcome of further procurement of the change would be uncertain in terms of attaining compliance with the court\u2019s legal opinion\n\n- the annulment of the change restored the territory to its original functional use, which can form the basis for decision-making in the territory at this moment; from the point of view of consequences for the substance (conceptual solution) of the zoning plan, the procurement of change Z 1294/07 is not essential\n\n- Projekt Sever, s.r.o., as the owner of most of the land in the territory in question demanding the continuation of the procurement of the zoning plan change on the grounds of minimising the damages it has incurred, became the owner of the land at a time when the procurement of Z 1294/07 had not been completed and its functional use corresponded to the current functional use of the area in the zoning plan, i.e. the functional use of the area after the annulment of the zoning plan change.\"463\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 3.\n\n486.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the reasoning provided by the Assembly covers the most significant issues: it explains that the District of Benice, which had been one of the applicants of the Zoning Plan Change, had at a later stage requested its judicial annulment, and now opposed the possibility of re-procurement; that the re-procurement faced difficulties in trying to comply with the deficiencies identified by the Court; that the land would be restored to its original designated use under the zoning plan, the same use which had been applicable when Projekt Sever had made the purchase.\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the reasoning meets the requirements set forth by Dr. Tomoszkov\u00e1 in her report:\n\n- It assesses the nature of the defects, and concludes that it is \"uncertain\" whether re-procurement could \"[attain] compliance with the court\u2019s legal opinion\";\n\n- It evaluates the impact on the conceptual design, explaining that the territory will be restored to its \"original functional design\" and that the re-procurement is not essential for the conceptual solution of the zoning plan;\n\n- It considers the consequences, including the legitimate expectations of the affected persons, pointing out that Projekt Sever had acquired the Project Area when the zoning change had yet to be approved and that the land now had the same use than it had at the time the investor acquired it,464 adding that the developer could start the procedure anew and provide better substantiation.465\n\nResolution of the Prague City Assembly no. 6/12 of 14 April 2015, **C-100**, Annex I, p. 3.\n\nResolution of the Prague City Assembly no. 6/12 of 14 April 2015, **C-100**, Annex I, p. 5.\n\n488.\n\nSumming up, Claimants argue that the decision of the Prague City Assembly dismissing the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change was unreasonable, disproportionate and arbitrary. The Tribunal disagrees. The unanimous decision of the Assembly to dismiss the proposal to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change was properly substantiated and consequently it was a reasoned decision, which did not breach the prohibition of unreasonable measures provided for in Article 4 of the BIT.\n\nC. **Counterargument**\n----------------------\n\n489.\n\nIn reaching that decision the Tribunal has considered Claimants\u2019 counterargument and rejects it for the following reasons.\n\n490.\n\nClaimants argue that Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd, who was responsible for spatial planning issues at the City of Prague, made less than candid statements to the Assembly to ensure that the re-procurement was not approved.466\n\nHT 58:18-24; C-PHB, paras. 133-141.\n\n491.\n\nThe facts do not support Claimants\u2019 argument.\n\n492.\n\nBy early 2015, Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd of the Green Party was responsible for spatial planning issues in Prague, the area of the Municipality in charge of the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change. In this capacity, he put the re-procurement on the agenda of the Committee on Spatial Development meeting (on 15 February 2015) and of the City Council (on 31 March 2015). The Council discussed the issue and instructed Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd to submit the matter to the Assembly, with the recommendation that the Assembly vote to dismiss the re-procurement.467\n\nCity Assembly Meeting Transcript and Resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 9.\n\n493.\n\nImmediately thereafter, the City published a press release, stating that the City Council had proposed that the Assembly should not re-procure Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07. In the release, entitled \"Sebastian Pawlowski\u2019s big residential complex between Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves is not going to happen\", Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd is quoted as saying:\n\n\"This means that the intent for a residential complex in this location is cancelled. At the same type this is a systemic step. The practice ends where developers speculate on the purchase of cheap farmland and afterwards claw back from the City the change to lucrative land for construction. Who buys farm land will have farm land [...].\"468\n\n\"Sebastian Pawlowski's big residential complex between Benice and Uhrineves is not going to happen\", City of Prague announcement, 1 April 2015, **C-181**.\n\n494.\n\nHe then added:\n\n\"The majority owner of the land of the zoning change (Z-1294/07), the company Projekt Sever s.r.o was informed about the court decision. At the same time the company was asked, should it wish a new procurement, to request this through the City borough concerned. [...] The owner is threatening with arbitration for lost investment but the City Council did not react to the threat. There is no legal right to have the zoning changed.\"\n\n495.\n\nTwo weeks later, on 14 April 2015, the re-procurement was tabled on the agenda of the Prague Assembly, and Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd presented the matter making a short introduction:\n\n\"This is about the relatively well-known land belonging to Projekt Sever, which is owned by the well-known businessman Sebastian Pawlowski, and it is about land plots, which were bought as a field and the owner of the land has afterwards sought to have the land judicially transformed into building land, which we judged to be unacceptable pressure; there is no legal entitlement to the procurement of zoning plan changes. [...]\n\nWe therefore propose that the termination of the procurement of this change be approved. I would add that the change was annulled by a court, but we could now actually comply with the court\u2019s observations, recommended in respect of this change, and we could commence the procurement of the change again, on the basis of the court\u2019s recommendations.\n\nHowever, I do not propose that we pay any more attention to this change. I propose that we do not procure it at all, i.e. I propose that the termination of the procurement of this change be approved.\"469\n\nCity Assembly meeting transcript and resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 1.\n\n496.\n\nAfter this short speech, the debate was opened. Only one Assembly member took the floor, to state, in a two-line declaration, that he fully agreed with the proposal to dismiss. Thereafter the vote was taken, resulting in a 51:0 result in favour of dismissing re-procurement.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n497.\n\nThe record establishes that Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd was firmly opposed to the possibility of re-procuring the Zoning Plan Change. But it does not show that he made false statements in the press release (i) or that he 'manipulated\u2019 the Assembly (ii).\n\n498.\n\n(i) Claimants take issue with the fact that in the quote included in the press release, the Deputy Mayor stated that developers speculate by buying \"cheap farmland\", while Projekt Sever had bought the land from the Ministry of Defense, the Municipality and from private landowners at a price which exceeded that for farmland.\n\n499.\n\nThe criticism is misguided: Claimants bought the land for an average price of CZK 1,253 per sqm, which is well below the maximum prices paid for developed land, which could reach CZK 2,900 per m2, as confirmed by Claimants\u2019 valuation expert, Mr. Karl Schumacher of AlixPartners:\n\n\"The Claimants\u2019 site was prospective building land and priced accordingly; the Claimants paid an average price of about CZK 1,253 per sqm. As a comparison, according to Respondent\u2019s data, in 2007 the official prices for already developed land (with buildings and infrastructure) in the larger area around Claimants\u2019 site most often ranged from CZK 510 per sqm to CZK 2,900 per sqm.\"470\n\nSchumacher ER I, para 127 [internal footnotes omitted].\n\n500.\n\n(ii) Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd\u2019s words before the Assembly can also not be faulted. He expressed his preference for the Assembly to dismiss the re-procurement option, but he also explained that the alternative to continue with the procurement, abiding by the Court Decision, was available. The Assembly unanimously voted for the first alternative.\n\n501.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no \"manipulation.\"\n\n**3.5 B****enice****\u2019****s opposition to the re****-****procurement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nClaimants finally submit that Benice\u2019s insistence, after the Annulment Decision, that there should be no re-procurement was highly unusual, unreasonable and disproportionate to achieve its policy aims.471\n\nC-PHB, para. 113.\n\n503.\n\nRespondent rejects the notion that it was unheard of for a municipality to propose and later challenge the same zoning plan change. To the contrary, Respondent argues that in the course of zoning plan changes, a long and democratic process, it is in fact a frequent occurrence that a borough, after having applied for a zoning change, then changes its mind and withdraws the application(s).472\n\nR-PHB, para. 193.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n504.\n\nThe underlying facts are straightforward: In the spring of 2015, when the Prague City finally took up the issue whether to re-procure Zoning Plan Change Z 1294/07, a representative of Benice attended the Prague City Council where the issue was being discussed and insisted that Benice was opposed to re-procurement.473\n\nCity Assembly meeting transcript and resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 1; HT 812:8-813:20.\n\n505.\n\nDistricts have a very limited role in the re-procurement of a zoning plan change which has been annulled by the Courts. The decision must be taken by the Prague City Assembly, upon a proposal of the Council. In this case a representative of the District was invited to attend the Council, and there expressed the District\u2019s position that the re-procurement should be rejected.474 In his speech before the Assembly, Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd then publicly stated that the District did not agree with the re-procurement (as was the case).475\n\nHT 812:13-813:24.\n\nCity Assembly meeting transcript and resolution no. 6/12, 14 April 2015, **C-100**, p. 1.\n\n506.\n\nThere is no evidence that Benice\u2019s opposition to the re-procurement swayed the (unanimous) decision of the City Assembly. But even if it had, the District\u2019s conduct in this case could not constitute a breach of the BIT. The District took the position that the Zoning Plan Change was illegal, and its position had been upheld by the Courts. When the possibility of re-procurement was tabled, it was only coherent for the District to voice opposition.\n\n**VII.1.3.** **D****iscriminatory measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nClaimants allege, and Respondent denies, that the Czech Republic breached the BIT\u2019s prohibition against \"discriminatory measures\" and \"less favourable treatment\" under Articles 4(1) and 4(2), because it approved (and re-procured) zoning changes for other projects while simultaneously terminating Claimants\u2019 Project.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize Claimants\u2019 and Respondent\u2019s position [**1.** and **2.**] and then adopt a decision [**3.**].\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n509.\n\nClaimants say that Benice and the City of Prague singled out Claimants and prohibited the Zoning Plan Change, while numerous other developers were authorised to construct new residential complexes near Claimants\u2019 Project Area.476\n\nC-II, para. 487.\n\n510.\n\nClaimants explain that they are in the same line of business as five other investors (Skanska, CPI, Ekospol, Vivius, and Central Group), noting that these entities were all similarly placed in the market and all were developing residential buildings in the immediate vicinity of Prague during the same period of time.477\n\nC-II, para. 490, referring to *Invesmart,* **RL-2**, para. 415; C. Schreuer and R. Dolzer, *Principles of International Investment Law'\",* Oxford University Press 2012, **CL- 50**, p. 200.\n\n511.\n\nAdditionally, Claimants assert that it is sufficient if the investors themselves - and not necessarily the investors\u2019 projects - are comparable. Claimants argue that it is not necessary to prove that all of the projects are of the same scale or are located in the exact same area.478\n\nC-II, paras. 491-492, referring to *Nycomb,* **CL-60**, p. 53; *Olin Holdings,* **CL-61**, para. 207 (where the fact that two factories operated in the same business sector was an appropriate comparator, reinforced by the existence of a similar location.)\n\n512.\n\nClaimants allege that both Benice [**A.**] and the City of Prague [**B.**] subjected Claimants and their investments to discriminatory and less favorable treatment in violation of the BIT.\n\nA. **Benice\u2019s conduct discriminated against Claimants**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nClaimants argue that Benice treated Claimants\u2019 investment less favorably than it did other investments. According to Claimants, at the same time as Claimants\u2019 Project was being destroyed, other zoning changes were being approved and permits were being granted which allowed development of numerous projects by other investors in direct proximity to Claimants\u2019 Project Area. Claimants maintain that several companies in the immediate area (Skanska, CPI, Ekospol, Vivius, and Central Group) received more favorable treatment than they did.479\n\nC-I, para. 207.\n\n514.\n\nAdditionally, Claimants note that of those companies, only one (Skanska) is a non-Czech company. According to Claimants, this suggests that Mr. Pawlowski was singled out in part because he is a foreigner.480\n\nC-I, para. 208.\n\n515.\n\nClaimants allege that Benice\u2019s reasons for opposing Claimants\u2019 Project are not legitimate and reveal their less favorable treatment of Claimants\u2019 investments. At the same time that Benice acted to prevent Claimants\u2019 Project, it did nothing to oppose a zoning change (Z-1278) which converted an area of land designated for a kindergarten, a primary school and a secondary school into an area zoned for the development of a multi-story hotel tower and complex owned by a private investor.481\n\nC-II, paras. 322-323, referring to Langmajer WS II, para. 17.\n\nB. **The City of Prague treated Claimants less favorably**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nClaimants argue that by refusing to apply its standard procedure after the Annulment Decision, the City of Prague treated Claimants less favorably than other investors, in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT.482\n\nC-PHB, para. 120, referring to *Pope & Talbot,* **CL-108**, para. 42.\n\n517.\n\nAccording to Claimants, upon the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, the normal course of action would have been for the Zoning Plan Division promptly to remedy the deficiencies identified by the Court, assuming that the applicant wanted to pursue the Zoning Plan Change.483\n\nC-PHB, para. 118.\n\n518.\n\nClaimants rely on the testimony of Dr. Nov\u00e1\u010dek, in which he explained that the City\u2019s decision to terminate the procurement of the Zoning Change Plan was political. Dr. Nov\u00e1\u010dek also noted that while in other cases the City worked proactively with the developer to eliminate errors identified by a court, it refused to do so in Claimants\u2019 case.484\n\nC-PHB, para. 118, referring to Nov\u00e1cek WS, para. 21; HT 412:24-413:10, 414:5-415:5, 415:23-416:13.\n\n519.\n\nClaimants allege that the City of Prague\u2019s treatment of the Project was unique: it marked the first time in the history of the Czech Republic that a zoning change was annulled for formal reasons and not procured again, in a case in which the applicant required that the procurement continue.485\n\nC-PHB, para. 146.\n\n520.\n\nClaimants identify Central Group a.s. (\"**Central Group**\") as one of the Czech developers which was in a similar situation (having had its zoning plan change annulled) and which was treated more favorably than Claimants by the City of Prague. According to Claimants, the City repeatedly re-procured Central Group\u2019s zoning plan change Z-1424/07, after it had been annulled multiple times.486\n\nC-PHB, paras. 149-151.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n521.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 allegations and avers that the Czech Republic did not discriminate against Claimants or treat their investments \"less favorably\" than those of Czech investors.487\n\nR-I, paras. 341-357; R-II, paras. 416-425.\n\n522.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants have not identified an appropriate comparator upon which to base their allegations of discrimination: it maintains that Claimants are required to identify a Czech real estate developer, which had applied for a zoning plan change under conditions substantively similar to those of Claimants. Respondent additionally notes that such conditions include the size and location of the comparator project, and the applicant\u2019s conduct in the re-zoning process.488\n\nR-PHB, para. 203, referring to *Invesmart,* **RL-2**, para. 415 (finding adequate comparators \"requires more than an identification of single points of similarity [...]. There must be a broad coincidence of similarities covering a range of factors. The comparators be similarly placed in the market and the circumstances of the request [...] must be similar\"); *Al Tamimi,* **RL-104**, para. 463 (\"The Claimant must point to evidence that a domestic operator which possessed the same or substantially similar approvals as the Claimant, and carried out the same or substantially similar material conduct was treated less harshly or according to a different standard*.*\").\n\nA. **Benice did not discriminate against Claimants**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nRespondent argues that Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s Project was not singled out by Benice or by its Mayor. Respondent notes that most of the projects referred to by Claimants are not within Benice\u2019s territory, and Benice therefore could not have opposed them.489\n\nR-PHB, para. 206.\n\n524.\n\nWith respect to the two projects within Benice, Respondent argues that they are not relevant comparators, because Claimants have not shown that they belonged to Czech investors, and so they are irrelevant to Claimants\u2019 discrimination claims based on national treatment. Additionally, Respondent notes that the two projects were vastly different from Claimants\u2019 project in terms of their size: one of the projects comprised 49 low-rise houses and the other comprised a single hotel building with less than 50 rooms. Claimants\u2019 Project, in contrast, would have added 4,000 permanent residents to an area currently housing 500 residents.490\n\nR-PHB, para. 207, referring to Cpi Residence Family houses Benice, **R-26**; Rooms - Park Holiday Congress & Wellness Hotel Praha, **R-76**.\n\nB. **The City of Prague did not discriminate against Claimants**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nRespondents also reject Claimants\u2019 allegation that the City of Prague discriminated against Claimants or their Project. The decision to terminate the re-procurement complied with Czech law, was thoroughly justified, and was not impacted by the fact that Mr. Pawlowski was a foreigner.491\n\nR-PHB, para. 218.\n\n526.\n\nRespondent adds that none of the other developers to which Claimants refer was in a situation similar to that of Claimants or their Project. Respondent explains that of the developers to which Claimants refer, only one, Central Group, had its zoning change annulled by the Czech courts and later re-procured.492\n\nR-PHB, paras. 210-211, referring to HT 62:8-14.\n\n527.\n\nRespondent notes that Central Group is a Cypriot company, and it should not therefore impact on Claimants\u2019 national treatment claim.493 Additionally, Respondent explains that the land impacted by Central Group\u2019s project comprised a far smaller area than that affected by Claimants\u2019 project.494 Respondent emphasises a further distinction: following the annulment of the zoning change affecting Central Group\u2019s project, Central Group itself swiftly applied for its re-procurement. Respondent notes that in this case, Claimants were entitled to apply for the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, but they chose not to do so.495\n\nR-PHB, para. 212.\n\nR-PHB, para. 213.\n\nR-PHB, para. 215.\n\n528.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that even if Claimants had identified an appropriate comparator, any alleged difference in treatment was justified by the particularities of each zoning change. According to Respondent, tribunals have consistently found that reasonable distinctions between domestic and foreign investors do not constitute a breach of the national treatment standard.496\n\nR-I, paras. 358-362.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nClaimants argue that the Prague Municipality discriminated against them and treated their investment less favorably than the investments of other domestic and foreign investors: during the relevant time period, other zoning changes were approved and permits were granted, which allowed the development of numerous projects by other investors in direct proximity to Claimants\u2019 Project Area. Furthermore, Claimants argue that by refusing to follow its standard procedure after the Annulment Decision, the City of Prague treated Claimants less favorably than other investors, in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT.497\n\nC-PHB, para. 120, referring to *Pope & Talbot,* **CL-108**, para. 42.\n\n530.\n\nRespondent denies any discrimination or less favourable treatment to Claimants\u2019 detriment: Claimants\u2019 Project was not singled out by Benice or its Mayor and the Prague City Assembly\u2019s decision to terminate the re-procurement was in compliance with Czech law, was justified and was not influenced by the fact that Mr. Pawlowski was a foreigner.498\n\nR-PHB, para. 218.\n\nDiscrimination\n--------------\n\n531.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the BIT prohibits \"discriminatory measures\", which impair the use or enjoyment of a protected investment. Discrimination is a relative standard, which requires a comparative analysis between measures applied to the protected investment and measures applied to other investments in similar situations.\n\n532.\n\nArticle 4(2) defines the NT and MFN standards, which prohibit discrimination based on nationality: the Czech Republic may not subject protected investors or their investments to treatment which is \"less favourable\" than that accorded to investments owned by other investors - either Czech or from other countries. To establish that the treatment effectively is \"less favourable\", a comparator in like circumstances must be defined.499\n\n*Parkerings,* **CL-8**, para. 369.\n\n533.\n\nIt is also widely accepted that there must be no objective reason which justifies the differential treatment.500\n\n*Bayindir Insaat,* **RL-76**, para. 399. See also C. Schreuer and R. Dolzer, *Principles of International Investment Law,* Oxford University Press 2012, **CL-50**, p. 202.\n\n534.\n\nSumming up, if a claim based on discrimination or breach of the NT and MFN standards is to succeed, the following three-pronged test must be satisfied:\n\n- First, an appropriate comparator must be identified, *i.e.,* an investor which is in a situation similar to that of Claimants (or an investment which is in a situation similar to Claimants\u2019 investment in the Czech Republic);501\n\n- Second, Claimant must prove that the Czech Republic has applied to this comparator a treatment more favourable than that accorded to Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever, or to their investment in the Czech Republic;\n\n- Third, there must be a lack of a reasonable or objective justification for the difference of treatment.502\n\n*Invesmart,* **RL-2**, para. 415; *Al Tamimi,* **RL-104**, para. 463.\n\n*Parkerings,* **CL-8**, para. 368; *Marvin Feldman,* **RL-108**, para. 170.\n\n535.\n\nThe burden of proving these three elements lies with Claimants.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n536.\n\nClaimants argue that Mr. Pawlowski was singled out because he was a foreigner,503 and that at the same time that Claimants\u2019 Project was being destroyed, other zoning changes were being approved and permits were being granted, allowing the development of numerous projects by other investors in direct proximity to Claimants\u2019 Project Area. Claimants specifically aver that several companies in the immediate area (Skanska, CPI, Ekospol, Vivius, and Central Group) received more favorable treatment than Claimants themselves.504\n\nC-I, para. 208.\n\nC-I, para. 207.\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that several other residential projects in the surrounding area of the Project were being promoted during the same period: in 2015 different real estate projects were underway near the Claimants\u2019 holdings, including projects being developed by the five developers identified by Claimants.505\n\nC-I, paras. 207-208.\n\n538.\n\nBut Claimants have not established that the treatment given to these investors was discriminatory or in breach of the FT and MFN standards:\n\n539.\n\nFirst, two of the aforementioned investors were Czech (Ekospol and Vivus), while the other three were foreigners (Skanska is from Sweden, CPI Group is from Luxembourg, and Central Group is owned and controlled by a Cypriot investor).506 This fact alone is sufficient to dispose of any notion that the Czech Republic singled out Mr. Pawlowski because he was a foreigner, and there is no suggestion of any discrimination specifically against Swiss investors.\n\nSkanska AB Company Profile (Reuters), **R-22**; Cpi Property Group SA Company Profile (Reuters), **R-23**; Central Group a.s., **R-24**.\n\n540.\n\nSecond, Claimants have failed to prove that the projects developed by these companies constitute adequate comparators to the Residential Complex envisaged by the Claimants in Benice:\n\n- in the case of Ekospol, the scale of the project (176 apartments)507 is not comparable with Claimants\u2019 proposed Residential Complex with housing for 4,000 residents;\n\n- CPI\u2019s project, the only development located in Benice and owned by a foreign investor, consisted in 49 low-rise houses;508 again, that is not comparable with Claimants\u2019 Project;\n\n- Claimants have failed to provide further information on the Skanska and Vivus projects.\n\nEkocity Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves I - ZipReality.cv, **R-25**.\n\nCpi Residence Family houses Benice, **R-26**.\n\nCentral Group\n-------------\n\n541.\n\nAs regards Central Group, the project was located in a different district of Prague (Komorany, which is twice the size and has twice the population of Benice) and concerned the re-zoning of an area eight times smaller than that of Claimants\u2019 Project.509 In 2009, Central Group had bought agricultural land in the district of Komorany, which was undergoing a zoning change procurement process. Central Group, much like Projekt Sever, invested while awaiting the completion of a zoning plan change (\"**Z-1424/07**\").510\n\nR-PHB, para. 213, referring to HT 910:7-13; C-II, para. 106.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 156.\n\n542.\n\nAfter the approval of zoning change Z-1424/07, Central Group initiated the planning permit procedure. In 2013 the District Prague 12 filed an action before the City Court requesting annulment. The City Court annulled zoning change Z-1424/07 on 5 February 2014, due to insufficient substantiation of the density coefficient increase and insufficient public discussion. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision on 24 October 2014.511\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 158-159.\n\n543.\n\nUpon annulment of its zoning change, Central Group applied for re-procurement, but it did so on the basis that it withdrew its prior request for increase in the density coefficient (the cause of the annulment).512 The Prague Municipality prepared a new substantiation and held a new public discussion. Thereafter, zoning change Z-1424/07 was approved by the Prague City Assembly for the second time on 15 September 2016.513\n\nR-PHB, para. 215; referring to HT 149:15-19.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1, ER II, para. 159.\n\n544.\n\nIn 2017, the zoning change was challenged again, this time by the civic association \"Spolek pro Komoa\u0159any\" and by a private citizen. Despite a better substantiation, on 20 June 2017 the City Court annulled the zoning change once again for other deficits in the substantiation.514 The re-procurement process was again initiated515 and on 19 September 2019 the Prague City Assembly approved the re-procurement of zoning change Z-1424/07 for the third time.516\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 160.\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 161.\n\nPrague City Assembly Resolution 9/11, 19 September 2019, **C-213**.\n\n545.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Claimants\u2019 expert that the case of Central Group shows that the Prague City Assembly is authorised to re-procure an annulled zoning change.517 But this is beside the point. The fact that Central Group\u2019s zoning change was annulled and re-procured twice does not make the case comparable to Claimants\u2019, there being significant differences between both:\n\n- The grounds on which the Czech Courts based their decisions to annul the respective zoning plan changes are different: Projekt Sever\u2019s Zoning Plan Change (Z-1294/07) was annulled because it had been approved in contravention of the law and lacked proper reasoning, while Central Group\u2019s zoning change Z-1424/07 was annulled only for formal reasons (deficit of substantiation);518\n\n- The reaction of the two developers was also different: upon annulment of its zoning change, Central Group voluntarily withdrew its prior request to increase the density coefficient and applied for re-procurement, while Claimants never changed the scope of the Residential Complex and never formally applied for the initiation of a new procurement procedure.519\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 162; HT 909:24-910:3.\n\nHT 910:7-911:3 (Tomoszkov\u00e1, Presentation).\n\nTomoszkov\u00e1 ER II, para. 165.\n\n546.\n\nBut even assuming *arguendo* that Central Group was a suitable comparator, Claimants\u2019 allegation of discrimination would still fail, because there may be valid reasons which justify the difference in treatment. Investment tribunals have consistently held that reasonable distinctions between domestic and foreign investors do not imply discrimination.520 Furthermore, the threshold applied to establish whether a State\u2019s conduct was justified has been low.521\n\n*Parkerings,* **CL-8**, para. 375; *Marvin Feldman,* **RL-108**, para. 170; *S.D. Myers,* **RL-98**, para. 246.\n\n*Parkerings,* **CL-8**, para. 371; *Gami,* **RL-47**, para. 114.\n\n547.\n\nIn establishing and amending zoning rules, municipal authorities take into consideration a variety of geographical, environmental and social reasons, and in weighing these factors they must enjoy a certain margin of discretion. The authorisation granted to develop a certain plot of agricultural land situated in Prague Komorany, does not of itself imply discrimination against Projekt Sever if its agricultural land in Benice is denied similar treatment; each project has its own characteristics, each project is situated in another environment and these differences can legitimately influence the authorities\u2019 decision.\n\n548.\n\nIn the present case, the Czech Courts found that Claimants\u2019 Project in Benice was contrary to the law, because it\n\n- affected the Boti\u010d-Mil\u00ed\u010dov nature park and was located in a \"construction freeze\" area;\n\n- was located in a zone of supra-local significance and required amendment of the Spatial Development Principles;\n\n- was situated on, or close to, the Prague-Bud\u011bjoviceu Bene\u0161ova railway corridor.\n\nThere is no evidence that Central Group\u2019s development was confronted with similar obstacles and constraints.\n\n549.\n\nIn sum: Claimants have failed to prove that the City of Prague\u2019s decision to treat the two investments differently, accepting the re-procurement of Central Group\u2019s project but denying that of Claimants\u2019, was not based on the existence of disparities between both developments, which justified such difference in treatment.\n\n550.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the evidence marshalled by Claimants is insufficient to prove their case: Claimants have been unable to identify a comparator in a similar situation, which received a more favourable treatment. And even if Central Group were to be considered an appropriate comparator (*quod non*), Claimants have not shown that the disparities between the two projects did not justify the difference in treatment in any event.\n\n**VII.1.4.** **FET: L****egitimate expectations**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n551.\n\nClaimants argue that their legitimate expectations were frustrated by the Czech Republic\u2019s conduct - an allegation which is rejected by Respondent.\n\n552.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarise the Parties\u2019 positions [**1.** and **2.**], and then provide its decision [**3.**].\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nClaimants note that transparency is \"closely related to protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations\" and requires that the legal framework for the investor\u2019s operations is readily apparent and that decisions which affect the investor can be traced back to that legal framework.522\n\nC-I, para. 286, quoting C. Schreuer and R. Dolzer, *Principles of International Investment Law,* Oxford University Press 2012, **CL-23**, p. 149.\n\n554.\n\nAccording to Claimants, in this case, there was a clear legal framework for approving changes to the Prague zoning plan, which the authorities followed during the early stages and up to the approval of the Zoning Plan Change in 2010. Thereafter, instead of following the standard process, officials reversed course and failed to uphold the Zoning Plan Change, which had been implemented in order to attract the investment of a developer such as Projekt Sever.523\n\nC-I, para. 287.\n\nLegitimate expectations\n-----------------------\n\n555.\n\nAs regards the applicable standard for legitimate expectations, Claimants argue that explicit promises (on the part of the host state) are not actually necessary in order to create legitimate expectations. Claimants refer to case law in support of the proposition that legitimate expectations may also arise through implicit assurances or representations upon which an investor reasonably relies.524\n\nC-II, paras. 407-410; C-PHB, paras. 24-26, referring to *Micula I,* **CL-26**, paras. 667-669; *Frontier Petroleum,* **CL- 21**, para. 224; *United Utilities,* **RL-183**, para. 576; *Saluka,* **RL-84**, para. 301.\n\n556.\n\nUltimately, according to Claimants, legitimate expectations may arise as a result of explicit or implicit representations of the State - representations which can themselves be based on statements or conduct. Importantly, such expectations may arise irrespective of whether the state actually intended to create reasonable expectations. The important question, argue Claimants, is whether, from the perspective of a reasonable investor, the conduct could be understood as a representation, by the state, on which the investor could rely.525\n\nC-II, paras. 409-410, referring to *Saluka,* **RL-84,** para. 329; *JSW Solar* (dissenting opinion), **CL-53**, para. 12.\n\n557.\n\nClaimants specifically assert that at the time they invested in the land they had a legitimate and reasonable expectation that they would be able successfully to develop the Residential Complex Benice [**1.1**], and at the time they invested in the design and planning of the Project, that the development would be successfully realised [**1.2**]. Finally, Claimants explain how they say the Czech Republic\u2019s actions violated said expectations [**1.3**].\n\n**1.1 C****laimants legitimately expected to develop a residential complex**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nClaimants elaborate on several facts and circumstances which, they argue, constitute implicit assurances by Respondent that the Project would be permitted to proceed to fruition:\n\n559.\n\nFirst, the timing of the Project.\n\n560.\n\nClaimants argue that when Projekt Sever purchased the land for the Project in 2007,526 it was reasonable to expect that it would be able successfully to complete the development of the Residential Complex Benice. Claimants note that the two City Districts in which the land was located - Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and Benice - had resolved to seek the Zoning Change in 2002 and had then applied for the Zoning Change in 2003 and 2004, respectively.527\n\nC-I, para. 55.\n\nC-PHB, para. 28, referring to Resolution of the Benice District Assembly, 13 March 2002, **C-19**; Resolution of the Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves District Assembly, 10 July 2002, **C-20**; Application for zoning plan change by Prague-Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, 2 October 2003, **C-21**; Application for zoning plan change by Prague-Benice, 26 April 2004, **C-22**.\n\n561.\n\nSecond, the Districts marketed the investment idea to Claimants.\n\n562.\n\nClaimants assert that, after the districts of Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves initiated the Zoning Change, they actively marketed the idea of developing a residential complex to potential developers. As such, in late 2006 and early 2007, Mayor Coller and Deputy Mayor Langmajer of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves encouraged Mr. Pawlowski to purchase the land for the development of a residential complex.528\n\nC-PHB, para 29.\n\n563.\n\nClaimants maintain that the several months of time which they dedicated to due diligence efforts was more than adequate. They note that it is typical for real estate developers to conduct due diligence quickly. Claimants emphasise that this is especially true in light of the fact that Mr. Pawlowski was an experienced developer, who had already successfully realised numerous development projects in Prague.529\n\nC-PHB, para. 33.\n\n564.\n\nClaimants refer to the recent decision in *SolEs Badajoz v. Spain,* wherein the tribunal held that legitimate expectations are to be determined with reference to the knowledge that a hypothetical prudent investor is deemed to have had as of the date of the investment, and also that the extent of inquiry that it is incumbent on a prudent investor to undertake depends on the particular circumstances of the case at hand.530\n\nC-PHB, para. 32, referring to *SolEs Badajoz,* **CL-114**, para. 331.\n\n565.\n\nThird, the purchase price paid for the plots of land for the Project.\n\n566.\n\nClaimants highlight the fact that Projekt Sever purchased land from citizens of Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves in 2007 for the price of CZK 1250 per square meter, a price some 25 times higher than the price of agricultural land. According to Claimants, this reflected the common understanding and expectation that the land would be developed for residential housing.531\n\nC-PHB, paras. 37-38.\n\n567.\n\nFourth, the authorities\u2019 assistance in the execution of the purchase agreements.\n\n568.\n\nClaimants emphasize Mayor Coller\u2019s and Deputy Mayor Langmajer\u2019s roles in coordinating the private land sales, and their hosting of a signing ceremony in the municipal office of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves. Claimants note that the signing ceremony was also attended by representatives of Benice, including former Mayor Miroslav Cubr, under whose leadership the rezoning and development project had been launched.532\n\nC-PHB, para. 37.\n\n569.\n\nFifth, the authorities\u2019 continued support from 2007 to 2012.\n\n570.\n\nClaimants explain that their expectations were not based on a single representation or a few individual representations, but on the fact that representatives of both Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and Benice continued to act in accordance with the perceived assurances throughout the period from 2007 to 2012.533\n\nC-PHB, para. 30.\n\n571.\n\nFor these reasons, while Claimants acknowledge that the Project Area had not yet been zoned for residential development when Projekt Sever purchased the land, they assert that they legitimately and reasonably expected that the Zoning Plan Change would be approved, and that Claimants would be able to carry out the development of a housing project of the scale of Residential Complex Benice.534\n\nC-PHB, para. 41.\n\n572.\n\nClaimants point to the fact that the Prague City Assembly voted in March 2010 to approve the zoning plan change as further evidence confirming the reasonableness of their expectations in 2007 and 2008 that such approval would be granted.535\n\nC-PHB, para. 43.\n\n**1.2 C****laimants legitimately expected the project would be successfully realised**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nClaimants assert that their legitimate expectations were maintained and even bolstered in the years following the land purchases, which led them to continue investing in the realisation of the Residential Complex Benice for five years, until Benice filed its annulment lawsuit in 2012. Thus, Claimants argue that the Tribunal must also assess Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations throughout this period.536\n\nC-PHB, para. 48, referring to *Frontier Petroleum,* **CL-21,** para. 287; *Crystallex,* **CL-12**, para. 557.\n\n574.\n\nClaimants maintain that their expectations were legitimate, because:\n\n575.\n\nFirst, following the land purchases, Claimants hired the Prague architect Marek Tich\u00fd (and his firm TaK) and paid for the design and planning of Residential Complex Benice. Claimants explain that TaK\u2019s work included designing the Project, drafting the Project documentation, preparing the numerous studies required to assess infrastructure requirements and environmental impacts and meeting with City and District officials regarding these issues.537 Claimants explain that they were presented with no obstacles during this period, and they note that, following its approval in March 2010, the Zoning Plan Change was not challenged until June 2012, when Benice filed its annulment lawsuit.538\n\nC-PHB, para. 52.\n\nC-PHB, para. 49.\n\n576.\n\nSecond, although Benice filed a lawsuit in 2009 challenging Projekt Sever\u2019s title to the land it had purchased from the City, Claimants considered that the lawsuit had no chance of success. Claimants note that the only communication received from Benice at the time was a proposal that Projekt Sever pay to settle the lawsuit, not an objection to construction of a large residential complex on the land.539\n\nC-PHB, para. 56.\n\n577.\n\nThird, Benice\u2019s May 2011 approval of the increase in density from level \"B\" to level \"C\" confirmed that it supported the development of a large residential complex and, along with prior approvals by various authorities, further confirmed that there were no substantive reasons why a residential complex of that density could not be realised in the Project Area.540\n\nC-PHB, paras. 57-58.\n\n578.\n\nClaimants explain that the OB-C zoning designation allowed for construction on the scale of 823 housing units in buildings as high as four floors. According to Claimants, TaK worked to refine the design of the project well within the limits of density coefficient OB-C, underscoring the fact that, at the time that work was stopped due to Benice\u2019s annulment lawsuit, the plans called for only 796 units.541\n\nC-PHB, paras. 59-60.\n\n579.\n\nClaimants additionally argue that during this period in which they continued to invest in the project, they had no reason to anticipate542:\n\n- that Benice would file a lawsuit in June 2012, seeking annulment of the Zoning Plan Change;\n\n- much less, that such a lawsuit would be successful; or\n\n- that the City of Prague would fail to remedy any defects found by the Court in the City\u2019s procurement process.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nC-PHB, para. 61.\n\nClaimants\u2019 due diligence efforts\n--------------------------------\n\n580.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s argument543 that their alleged expectations were objectively unreasonable, given the insufficiency of their due diligence efforts prior to investing.\n\nR-I, para. 298; R-PHB, para. 176, referring to *Gavrilovic,* **RL-81**, para. 986.\n\n581.\n\nAccording to Claimants, who rely on *SolEs Badajoz,* legitimate expectations are determined with reference to the knowledge that a hypothetical prudent investor is deemed to have had as of the date of the investment, and that the extent of inquiry that is incumbent on a prudent investor depends on the particular circumstances of the case.544\n\nC-PHB, para. 32, referring to *SolEs Badajoz,* **CL-114**, para. 331*.*\n\n582.\n\nClaimants assert that it is typical for real estate developers, especially those working in booming markets, to conduct due diligence quickly. Claimants note that Mr. Pawlowski was an experienced developer who had already successfully realized numerous development projects in Prague, and they argue that the several months of time taken by Claimants was more than adequate to conduct thorough due diligence.545\n\nC-PHB, paras. 32-33.\n\n**1.3 R****espondent****\u2019****s actions violated** **C****laimants****\u2019** **legitimate expectations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n583.\n\nClaimants consider that their legitimate expectations were violated by Benice, when it filed a lawsuit in 2012, seeking to annul the Zoning Plan Change [**A.**] and by the City of Prague\u2019s termination of the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change following its annulment [**B.**].\n\nA. **Benice\u2019s 2012 Annulment Request**\n--------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Benice\u2019s officials actively supported the development of a large residential complex in the Project Area for a decade, through the sale of the land at residential prices, which included \"an element of inducement\", thus requiring the state to stand by its statements and its conduct.546 By filing the Annulment Request, Benice failed to stand by its statements and conduct, reversed course and actively set out to destroy the Zoning Plan Change and prevent the realisation of the Project. Claimants thus argue that Benice\u2019s filing of the Annulment Request was a violation of the FET standard in Article 4 of the BIT.547\n\nC-II, paras. 441-451; C-PHB, para. 70, referring to *Micula I,* **CL-26**, para. 686.

According to Claimants, this reversal of position violated Article 4 of the BIT551.\n\nC-PHB, para. 167.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nRespondent asserts that the Republic\u2019s conduct did not frustrate Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, because under international law an investor\u2019s expectations are protected only when they satisfy very specific requirements, which Claimants do not satisfy.552 In particular, Claimants could not have held any legitimate expectations of developing a huge residential complex, since their land purchases for the Project involved non-residential lands [**2.1**]. Thus, Respondent argues that the actions of the Czech Republic did not, and could not, frustrate Claimants\u2019 alleged expectations [**2.2**].\n\nR-I, paras. 292-313.\n\n**2.1 C****laimants could not have held any legitimate expectations of developing**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n589.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 position and argues that Claimants could not have held any legitimate expectations, because:\n\n- Respondent did not make any specific and unambiguous representations [**A.**];\n\n- Claimants base their alleged expectations on promises that were not made by a competent person [**B.**] ; and\n\n- Claimants\u2019 alleged expectations were unreasonable in light of the Czech legal framework [**C.**] and the insufficiency of Claimants\u2019 due diligence efforts [**D.**].\n\nA. **No specific and unambiguous representations**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nAccording to Respondent, an investor cannot legitimately expect that a State\u2019s regulatory framework will not change, unless there has been a specific and unambiguous commitment by the State on which the investor reasonably relied at the time of investing.553\n\nR-II, paras. 345-346, referring to *Micula I,* **CL-26**, para. 666.\n\n591.\n\nRespondent argues that legitimate expectations can only exist within limited circumstances, which it explains as follows:\n\n- First, legitimate expectations can only arise from specific promises or representations from the State to an individual investor, on which the investor has relied in making its investment554;\n\n- Second, the existence of legitimate expectations must be assessed at the time of the investment - and cannot be founded on subsequent actions555;\n\n- Third, an investor\u2019s expectations must have been legitimate and reasonable in light of the circumstances, and not based on the investor\u2019s subjective motivations and considerations.556\n\nR-I, para. 296, referring to *Rusoro,* **RL-79**, para. 524; *White Industries,* **RL-80**, para. 10.3.7 (citing Newcombe and Paradell, Law and Practice of Investment Treaties, Standards of Treatment (2009) pp. 281-282); *Gavrilovic,* **RL-81**, para. 984; *Crystallex,* **CL-12**, para. 547.\n\nR-I, para. 297, referring to *Lemire,* **RL-83**, para. 264; *Gavrilovic,* **RL-81**, para. 984; *Micula I,* **CL-26**, paras. 672-673; *Tecmed,* **CL-17**, para. 154.\n\nR-I, para. 298, referring to *Jan de Nul,* **RL-70**, para. 186; *Rumeli,* **CL-15**, para. 609; *Saluka,* **RL-84**, para. 304.\n\n592.\n\nRespondent argues that there is no evidence in this case of any sufficiently specific and unambiguous representation made by the Czech Republic. According to Respondent, any representations invoked by Claimants, whether explicit or implicit, must be \"precise as to [their] content and clear as to [their] form\", in order to amount to the type of identifiable quasi-contractual commitment capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations.557\n\nR-PHB, para. 169, referring to *Crystallex,* **CL-12**, para. 547; *Mamidoil,* **RL-49**, para. 643; *Glamis Gold,* **RL-95**, paras. 766, 799.\n\n593.\n\nRespondent asserts that the alleged representations on its part and upon which Claimants purport to rely were all vague, ambiguous, or not even specifically addressed to them. Additionally, Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to provide evidence which supports their claim that they were encouraged to invest.558\n\nR-PHB, para. 170, referring to C-II, paras. 414-415.\n\nB. **The alleged promises were not made by competent persons**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n594.\n\nAccording to Respondent, for an investor\u2019s expectations to be objectively reasonable - and thus legitimate - they must arise out of representations made by a competent organ of the State.559\n\nR-II, para. 353; R-PHB, para. 172, referring to *Micula I,* **CL-26**, para. 669.\n\n595.\n\nThe final decision regarding the Zoning Plan Change came from the Prague City Assembly, and Claimants have neither claimed, nor demonstrated that the Assembly ever made any promise or representation to them that their lands would be rezoned.560\n\nR-PHB, para. 173.\n\nC. **Claimants\u2019 alleged expectations were unreasonable in light of the Czech legal framework pertaining to zoning changes**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n596.\n\nRespondent asserts that for an investor\u2019s expectations to be \"legitimate\", they must also be objectively reasonable in light of the surrounding legal and factual circumstances.561\n\nR-II, paras. 352-359; R-PHB, para. 175, referring to *Total,* **RL-85**, paras. 149, 178.\n\n597.\n\nAccording to Respondent, when Mr. Pawlowski purchased the land before it was zoned as residential, he chose to speculate on the outcome of the zoning process. Respondent argues that Mr. Pawlowski may have hoped, but could not have reasonably expected, to develop his residential complex there.562\n\nR-PHB, para. 175.\n\n598.\n\nRespondent explains that when Claimants purchased the land for the Project, they acquired the rights to agricultural land - the fact that the Zoning Change was initially approved by the Prague City Assembly before being annulled did not create an acquired right or a legitimate expectation.563\n\nR-PHB, para. 89.\n\n599.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent avers that at all stages, the actions taken by Benice and the City of Prague were within the legal framework pertaining to zoning changes. Respondent notes that Czech law provides for a two-year period during which any change to the zoning plan can be challenged before the Czech courts.564\n\nR-PHB, para. 91.\n\nD. **Claimants\u2019 alleged expectations were unreasonable given the insufficiency of their prior due diligence**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n600.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 due diligence was inadequate and contends that, in general, investors\u2019 prior due diligence plays a central role in evaluating the reasonableness of their expectations.565\n\nR-PHB, para. 176, referring to *Gavrilovic,* **RL-81**, para. 986. R-I, para. 307.\n\n601.\n\nRespondent argues that had Claimants conducted proper due diligence, they would have easily uncovered multiple important facts including:\n\n- that a zoning change (Zoning Change Z-592/04) covering Mr. Pawlowski\u2019s land plots had already been rejected by the Prague City Assembly, despite having the support of Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves566; and\n\n- that some authorities had already voiced concern as to the environmental impact of a residential development in the area.567\n\nR-PHB, para. 21, referring to Area affected by proposed zoning change Z 0592/04, Annex to Draft Zoning Change Z 0592/04, **R-37**, p. 1; Area affected by Zoning Change Z 1294/07, Graphic description of the history of zoning change Z 1294, **C-48**.\n\nR-I, para. 303, referring to position statement on round 06 zoning plan changes by the Environmental Division of the Municipal Office of the City of Prague, 17 March 2005, **C-35**.\n\n602.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent argues that Mr. Pawlowski never seriously investigated the expectations of the Benice Assembly for the development of the land. Respondent notes that Benice originally conceived of residential expansion in the area which would raise the population by approximately 600 people from among citizens living in the area.568 Thus, Mr. Pawlowski should have expected that developing a residential complex which would bring 4,000 new people into a borough with a population of 465 inhabitants, would likely lead the local population to oppose the project.569\n\nR-I, para. 307, referring to \"Benice is expanding\", Euro.cz, 28 June 2004, **C-17**.\n\nR-PHB, para. 24.\n\n603.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s view that, for the reasons stated above, Claimants\u2019 expectations that they would be able to develop a large residential complex were not objectively reasonable or legitimate. Respondent adds that the Claimants cannot use the BIT\u2019s FET clause as an insurance policy for risky business decisions.570\n\nR-PHB, para. 177, referring to *MTD,* **CL-9**, para. 178.\n\n**2.2 T****he** **C****zech** **R****epublic did not frustrate** **C****laimants****\u2019** **alleged expectations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nRespondent maintains that the Czech Republic did not frustrate Claimants\u2019 alleged expectations because: Benice was entitled to pursue the Annulment Decision [**A.**], and the City of Prague\u2019s actions were not outside of the norm [**B.**].\n\nA. **Benice was entitled to seek the Annulment Decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n605.\n\nRespondent asserts that no treaty protection could prevent Benice from exercising its right to request the annulment of a zoning plan change that might affect it. According to Respondent, the exercise of that right was appropriately enforced under Czech law by the Czech Courts and it did not violate Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.571\n\nR-PHB, para. 7.\n\n606.\n\nRespondent acknowledges Claimants\u2019 explanation that FET requires a balancing between the investors\u2019 legitimate expectations on one hand and the host State\u2019s legitimate regulatory interests on the other.572 According to Respondent, however, Benice had legitimate concerns after becoming aware of the scale of the Project. Additionally, Respondent argues that Benice\u2019s challenge to the Zoning Plan Change was within its legal rights and was exercised as part of its prerogatives.573\n\nR-II, para. 384, referring to C-II, para. 453 (itself referring to *Saluka,* **RL-84**, paras. 297, 306).\n\nR-I, para. 309.\n\nB. **The City of Prague did not behave unexpectedly**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nRespondent argues that, even if Claimants\u2019 expectations were somehow considered legitimate *(quod non),* the facts demonstrate that the City of Prague did nothing to frustrate them.574\n\nR-II, paras. 402-404; R-PHB, para. 178.\n\n608.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants\u2019 case relies on the standard set by the *Foresight* tribunal, which found that the frustration of legitimate expectations requires \"an unprecedented and wholly different regulatory approach, based on wholly different premises that amounted to a total and unreasonable change\" of the regulatory regime surrounding an investment.575\n\nR-PHB, para. 180, referring to *Foresight Luxembourg,* **CL-52**, para. 397. See also *Eiser,* **CL-56**, para. 365.\n\n609.\n\nAccording to Respondent, however, this case is not *Foresight.* There is nothing unprecedented about the Prague City Assembly\u2019s decision not to re-procure an annulled zoning plan change. Respondent points out that there are still at least twice as many annulled zoning changes that the Assembly did not re-procure (at least six) than changes that it has re-procured (three).576\n\nR-PHB, para. 181 and fn. 239, referring to: HT, 1015:6-1017:6; \"Changes affected by a court decision\", **R-60***.*\n\n610.\n\nUltimately, according to Respondent, the Prague City Assembly\u2019s regulatory approach in deciding not to re-procure the Zoning Change was neither unprecedented, nor out of the norm. Rather, it was made in accordance with Czech law and in line with its standard procedures.577\n\nR-PHB, para. 183, R-I, para. 312.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nClaimants allege that the Czech Republic breached its duty to guarantee FET as required by Article 4(2) of the BIT by violating Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations. Article 4(2) reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.\"578\n\nBIT, **C-1**, Article 4(2).\n\n612.\n\nIt is uncontentious that the obligation to accord FET to investments encompasses the protection of an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. Such expectations arise when a State (or its agencies) makes representations or commitments or gives assurances, upon which the foreign investor (in the exercise of an objectively reasonable business judgment) relies, and the frustration occurs when the State thereafter changes its position as against those expectations in a way that causes injury to the investor.579 The protection of legitimate expectations is closely connected with the principles of good faith,580 estoppel and the prohibition encapsulated in the maxim *venire contra factum proprium.*\n\n*Tecmed,* **CL-17**, para. 154; *Cervin,* **RL-97**, para. 509; *ECE,* **RL-55**, para. 4-762; *Parkerings,* **RL-66**, para. 331.\n\n*Thunderbird*, **RL-48**, para. 147.\n\n613.\n\nA State can create legitimate expectations *vis-\u00e0-vis* a foreign investor in two different contexts:\n\n- In the first context, the State makes specific representations, assurances, or commitments directly to the investor (or to a narrow class of investors or potential investors) (\"direct legitimate expectations\");\n\n- but legal expectations can also be created in some cases by the State\u2019s general legislative and regulatory framework: an investor may make an investment in reasonable reliance\n\nupon the stability of that framework, so that in certain circumstances a reform of the framework may breach the investor\u2019s regulatory legitimate expectations.\n\n614.\n\nIn this case, Claimants submit that the Czech Republic gave implicit assurances and thus created a direct legitimate expectation that the Zoning Plan Change would be approved, and that the investor would be able successfully to develop the Residential Complex; after having created this legitimate expectation, and induced Claimants to purchase land and to continue investing in the Project, the Czech Republic, without justification, changed its position and withdrew the Zoning Plan Change, causing injury to the investor and breaching the FET standard.\n\n615.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal must determine whether Claimants indeed had a direct legitimate expectation that the Project would materialise and whether this expectation was unlawfully breached by the Czech Republic. The Arbitral Tribunal will briefly recall the relevant facts concerning this issue [**A.**] and will then issue its decision [**B.**].\n\nA. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n616.\n\nIn 2007 *(i.e.*, three years before the City Assembly\u2019s approval of the zoning change) Mr. Pawlowski was introduced to the Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, Mr. Coller and to the Deputy Mayor, Mr. Langmajer. Mr. Pawlowski was actively looking for investment opportunities. In the course of their discussion Mr. Coller and Mr. Langmajer informed him of the ongoing efforts by the district of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves to find a developer to construct a residential complex in Benice.\n\n617.\n\nThe Mayor and Deputy Mayor informed Mr. Pawlowski that the Project Area was in the process of being re-zoned to allow residential construction. Mr. Pawlowski was also informed that the Concept for the re-zoning had already been approved and that private citizens as well as the City of Prague wanted to sell their plots of land to a developer who would pursue the development of the Project.581 Mr. Pawlowski met with the leadership of the local governments of Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, including the head of the construction division of the Prague 22 Administrative District (which covered both Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and Benice).\n\nPawlowski WS I, paras. 11-12; Zugar WS, paras. 6, 9; Coller WS I, paras. 13-14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 purchase of land\n---------------------------\n\n618.\n\nProjekt Sever eventually concluded all of the relevant land purchases between June 2007 and December 2008 at a time when the re-zoning was still underway (a Concept had been approved by the City Assembly, but the Assembly\u2019s final approval would only come two years later in 2010).\n\n619.\n\nProjekt Sever acquired the Project Area from different owners: private citizens, the City of Prague, and the Ministry of Defense of the Czech Republic.\n\n620.\n\nThe majority of the Project Area involved land previously owned by private landowners. The purchase process went smoothly, because from the outset, Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves\u2019 Mayor Coller and Deputy Mayor Langmajer offered the District\u2019s assistance in coordinating the transactions.582\n\nZugar WS, paras. 6, 10.\n\n621.\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the district of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves organised and hosted a signing ceremony in the Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves town hall for the private property owners, with a scheduled time slot for each family. Among the officials present were Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves\u2019 Mayor Coller, Deputy Mayor Langmajer and the former mayor of the district of Benice, Mr. Cubr, under whose leadership the re-zoning and development project had been launched.583\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 25; Coller WS I, para. 16; Zugar WS, paras. 12-13.\n\nProjekt Sever\u2019s purchase of land from the City of Prague\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n622.\n\nClaimants also pursued the purchase of certain plots of land owned by the City of Prague and located within the District of Benice.584 The Benice District Assembly had since June 2000 delegated the administration of these plots to the neighboring District of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves,585 and Claimants therefore negotiated directly with officials from Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves.\n\nZugar WS, paras. 15-16.\n\nResolution by the Benice District Assembly, 28 June 2000, **C-25**.\n\n623.\n\nA tender was launched, and the only bidder was Projekt Sever. Its \"envelope\" was opened on 23 May 2007 before the Council of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, and Mr. Langmajer, the Deputy Mayor, explained to the Council the buyer\u2019s intention, which was \"to build a residential complex on an extensive area.\"586 The Council agreed to the sale, and three weeks thereafter, on 16 June 2007, the Assembly of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves formally approved the sale of the land, which was described as \"arable land\" and \"forest land.\" The Assembly\u2019s Resolution made no reference to the zoning situation of the land plots, nor to the investor\u2019s intention.587\n\nUh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves Council Resolution regarding sale to Projekt Sever, 11 June 2007, **C-66**, p. 1/7.\n\nUh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves Assembly Resolution regarding approval of sale to Projekt Sever, 13 June 2007, **C-67**, p. 1/3.\n\n624.\n\nOn 20 June 2007, Projekt Sever and Prague 22 District signed the Prague Purchase Contract, which simply described the asset as \"arable land\"; the buyer paid CZK 43,820,000 for the 43,784 m2 of land owned by the City of Prague. There is no reference to the pending Zoning Plan Change, nor any representation or warranty regarding the possibility to develop a housing complex on the land.588\n\nPurchase Agreement between Prague 22 district Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and Projekt Sever, 20 June 2007, **C-26**.\n\nPurchase of military owned land\n-------------------------------\n\n625.\n\nIn addition, Projekt Sever also purchased a small portion of land (about 8% of the total) from the Czech Ministry of Defense, which owned several small plots of land in the Project Area as well as old buildings that had once served as housing for military personnel, and included structures such as workshops, fencing, and outdoor lighting.589 By 1992 the military had mostly abandoned the complex, but the buildings and related structures remained. As of 2007 the majority of the military owned buildings and fixtures were in a state of disrepair.590\n\nPawlowski WS I, para. 27; Cadastral map illustrating ownership of plots of land prior to the acquisitions by Projekt Sever, **C-24**; Appraisal for the Department of Defense, 19 May 2008, **C-29**.\n\nZugar WS, para. 19; Appraisal for the Department of Defense, 19 May 2008, **C-29**.\n\n626.\n\nOn 8 December 2008 Projekt Sever signed the Defense Purchase Contract with the Ministry of Defense. The buyer paid CZK 10,854,281 to the Ministry for 1,135 m2 of land, and for the right to tear down the structures and dispose of the spoil.591 The Defense Purchase Contract describes the object of the sale as \"structures\" and \"miscellaneous\" and \"unfertile\" land. Again, there is no reference to the pending Zoning Plan Change, nor any representation or warranty regarding the possibility to develop a housing complex on the land.592\n\nZugar WS, para. 21; Appraisal for the Department of Defense, 19 May 2008, **C-29**; Email communication between Petr B\u011blovsk\u00fd and Petr Fryc, 24 and 25 November 2008, **C-30**; Purchase Agreement between the Czech Republic -Czech Ministry of Defense and Projekt Sever, 8 December 2008, **C-31**.\n\nPurchase Agreement between the Czech Republic - Czech Ministry of Defense and Projekt Sever, 8 December 2008, C-31, p. 2/12.\n\nB. **Decision**\n---------------\n\n627.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined593 that direct legitimate expectations - the type of expectations allegedly violated by Respondent in this case594 - can only result in the breach of the FET standard if the following criteria are met:\n\n- The host State must have made specific and unambiguous representations, assurances or promises,\n\n- These declarations must have been made to an investor prior to, or at the time of, the investment; and\n\n- the expectations must be reasonable and legitimate in light of the circumstances.\n\nSee para. 612 *supra*.\n\nSee para. 614 *supra*.\n\n628.\n\nA careful review of the facts shows that neither the Czech Republic, nor any of its territorial divisions (including the Districts of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and Benice and the City of Prague) made any specific and unambiguous representations, assurances, or promises to Claimants that the procurement of the Zoning Plan Change would be authorised or that the development of the Project would be successful:\n\n629.\n\nFirst, Projekt Sever signed two contracts with the Czech Republic for the purchase of land for the development of the Project:\n\n- the Prague Purchase Contract with the City of Prague and\n\n- the Defense Purchase Contract with the Ministry of Defense.\n\n630.\n\nThe object of both Contracts was \"agricultural land\", \"forest land\", \"miscellaneous land\", \"unfertile land\" and \"structures.\" There is no reference to the pending Zoning Plan Change - let alone a specific and unambiguous representation or assurance that the Zoning Plan Change would be successfully procured and that the terrain would become suitable for the development of a housing complex.\n\n631.\n\nThe absence of a specific representation in both Contracts is specially telling, because in the meeting of the Council of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, which declared that Projekt Sever had won the tender to purchase the land, Mr. Langmajer, the Deputy Mayor, explained to the Council that the buyer had the intention to build a residential complex.595 The subsequent resolution of the Assembly of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves, however, lacks any reference to the residential complex and simply authorises the sale of parcels of \"arable land.\" And the same language is then used in the Prague Purchase Contract.\n\nUh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves Council Resolution regarding sale to Projekt Sever, 11 June 2007, p. 1/7, **C-66**.\n\n632.\n\nClaimants were perfectly aware that they were buying land zoned as \"arable\" and \"forest\", and that while the Zoning Plan Change was being procured, it had not yet been authorised. It would be remarkable if Mr. Pawlowski, a seasoned real estate developer, had not sought contractual assurances from the City of Prague and from the Ministry of Defense, guaranteeing that the Zoning Plan Change would be procured; the absence of any such assurance in either the Prague and the Defense Purchase Contracts would suggest that if any such request was made, it had been turned down. Yet, notwithstanding the absence of any express commitment, Claimants were prepared to proceed with the purchase and to assume the contractual risk that, if the Zoning Plan Change was dismissed, Project Sever would remain the owner of agricultural and forest land, without any recourse against the public sector sellers.\n\n633.\n\nIt lies ill in Claimants\u2019 mouths now to protest the explicit distribution of risks agreed in the Contracts, and to claim that the Czech Republic, through an alleged breach of the FET standard, should assume a risk which, by agreement, fell to be borne by Claimants themselves.\n\n634.\n\nSecond, the facts show that, although the municipal authorities of both Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves supported the investment, they were careful never to make a specific and unambiguous declaration binding either of the Municipalities.\n\n635.\n\nMr. Coller - Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves - had the following recollection:\n\n\"The investor asked for assurance that the boroughs\u2019 support would not cease if he became involved in the project. The two boroughs constantly expressed support for the project they themselves had initiated.\"596 [Emphasis added]\n\nColler WS II, para 14.\n\n636.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Tribunal asked Mr. Coller, who was called as a witness by the Claimants, what he had promised Mr. Pawlowski in exchange for payment of a higher price for the land. Mr. Coller replied:\n\n\"[...] I cannot say that I promised anything because I was in an office; I wasn't running a company. This wasn't my promise. These were negotiations and discussions with the heads of departments and construction departments, et cetera. There were some materials about our agreement with starting the process of the required change. It was more or less an assurance that both boroughs desired the change, and, as I said, it had never happened that a change approved by both boroughs would not get through the Prague City Assembly, so we could as it were promise that the path we started on would be successful and it was inconceivable that this wouldn't be so.\"597 [Emphasis added]\n\nHT 313:15-314:3.\n\n637.\n\nThe words of the Mayor show that the District \"supported\" the Zoning Plan Change and the development, that the two boroughs \"desired\" the Zoning Plan Change to be successful and that previous experience showed that procurement in general was successful. General assurances of this type, made orally by politicians at the municipal level, and not reflected in the contractual documents signed with the very Municipality, are incapable of creating legitimate expectations on which an investor is entitled to rely, and even less of engaging the international responsibility of the Czech Republic.\n\n638.\n\nThird, even if it is assumed *arguendo* that the Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves made specific promises to the protected investor that the Zoning Plan Change would be procured *(quod non*), such conduct would still not give rise to a legitimate expectation, because it would have been rendered by an authority incompetent to make such a commitment.\n\n639.\n\nUnder Czech Law, zoning changes entail a long and democratic administrative process, which at its conclusion requires the approval by a body politic, the Prague City Assembly. Although the Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves Districts initiated and supported the Zoning Plan Change, the Mayor of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves had no competence over the approval. As for the City of Prague Assembly, Claimants are not claiming that the Assembly ever made any promise or representation that the Zoning Plan Change would be procured or re-procured.598\n\nR-PHB, para. 173.\n\n640.\n\nFourth, for an investor\u2019s expectations to be \"legitimate\", they must also be reasonable in light of the surrounding legal and factual circumstances.\n\n641.\n\nWhen Mr. Pawlowski purchased the Project Area, he made a business decision to invest in agricultural land, without requesting the City of Prague and the Ministry of Defense to provide contractual commitments or representations and warranties to the effect that the use of the land would be amended to his benefit. At that time there already existed reasonable doubts regarding the success of the Zoning Plan Change: a previous zoning change (Zoning Change Z-592/04) affecting the same area had already been rejected by the Prague City Assembly, despite having the support of Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves599 and some authorities had already voiced concern as to the environmental impact of a residential development in the area.600\n\nR-PHB, para. 21, referring to Area affected by proposed zoning change Z 0592/04, Annex to Draft Zoning Change Z 0592/04, **R-37**, p. 1; Area affected by Zoning Change Z 1294/07, Graphic description of the history of zoning change Z 1294, **C-48**.\n\nR-I, para. 303, referring to Position Statement on round 06 zoning plan changes by the Environmental Division of the Municipal Office of the City of Prague, 17 March 2005, **C-35**.\n\n642.\n\nMr. Pawlowski was perfectly aware, when he bought the real estate, that the Zoning Plan Change had not been authorised, and that there was a chance - even if then thought remote - that successful procurement would be thwarted by unforeseeable future developments.\n\n643.\n\nThis uncertainty was reflected in the purchase price which Claimants paid. Claimants bought the land for an average price of CZK 1,253 per sqm, which, while higher than that of agricultural land, was well below the maximum prices paid for developed land, which could reach CZK 2,900 per m2, as confirmed by Claimants\u2019 valuation expert, Mr. Karl Schumacher of AlixPartners.601\n\nSchumacher ER I, para 127, internal footnotes omitted.\n\n644.\n\nFifth, the fact that the Zoning Plan Change was initially approved by the Prague City Assembly did not create an acquired right. Czech law provides for a two-year period during which any change to the zoning plan can be challenged before the Courts.602 Claimants could have had no legitimate expectation that those with legal standing (the Districts or associations, or particular interested parties affected by the measure, *etc.)* would not exercise their legal right to challenge the procurement.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHT 961:9-20.\n\n645.\n\nIn summary, the conduct of the Districts of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and Benice, and of the Municipal authorities of Prague, did not generate a legitimate expectation, to the benefit of Claimants, that the Zoning Plan Change would be authorised by the Prague Assembly and that the Residential Complex could be successfully promoted.\n\n**VII.2.** **BREACH OF ARTICLE 3(2) OF THE BIT**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n646.\n\nClaimants allege that the City of Prague violated the obligation to \"grant the necessary permits\" under Article 3(2) of the BIT, by failing to cure the defects in the substantiation for the Zoning Plan Change.603\n\nC-I, paras. 265-272; C-II, paras. 546-557; C-PHB, para. 186, referring to BIT, Article 3(2).\n\n647.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize the Parties\u2019 positions [**1.** and **2.**] and then render its decision [**3.**].\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n648.\n\nClaimants assert that Article 3 of the BIT must be interpreted in accordance with the BIT\u2019s object and purpose of promoting investments.604 According to Claimants, the City\u2019s failure to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change blocked them from making the additional investments they would have made in order to complete the construction and sale of the Project. Thus, Claimants argue that this constituted a failure by the City to \"promote investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments.\"605\n\nC-II, paras. 548-554; C-PHB, para. 189, referring to VCLT, Article 31, **CL-72**; *Philip Morris,* **CL-10**, para. 168 (when a state enters into a treaty requiring it to create favorable conditions for and foster investments, this includes the obligation to grant \"the necessary permits and authorizations concerning the activities to be carried out by investors\").\n\nC-I, paras. 269-272; C-PHB, para. 187, referring to BIT, Article 3(1).\n\n649.\n\nAdditionally, according to Claimants, the reference in Article 4 of the BIT to the Article 3 obligation \"to issue the necessary authorizations\" confirms that the Contracting Parties did not intend to limit the scope of Article 3 to the issuance of \"permits\" as defined at the local level. Instead, Claimants argue that the approval of the Zoning Plan Change through the re-procurement process was itself a \"necessary authorization\" that was required to be granted in order for Claimants to proceed with the realisation of their Project.606\n\nC- II, paras. 550-554; C-PHB, para. 190.\n\n650.\n\nClaimants aver that because there were no legal obstacles standing in the way of the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, Respondent was required by Article 3 of the BIT to pursue said re-procurement. Claimants emphasize that re-procuring and approving the Zoning Plan Change in this case required no changes to the current laws and regulations and was therefore an obligation under Article 3 of the BIT.607\n\nC -II, paras. 555-557; C-PHB, para. 192.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 allegations.608\n\nR-I, paras. 267-276; R-II, paras. 300-334; R-PHB, para. 155.\n\n652.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that the allegations made by Claimants do not relate to \"permits\", but to a zoning plan change, and that the claim is therefore outside the scope of Article 3(2) of the BIT.609 Respondent emphasises that Article 3(2) applies to \"permits\", and in this case the Claimants did not reach the permitting stage, such that this provision of the BIT became relevant.610\n\nR-PHB, para. 158.\n\nR-PHB, para. 162, referring to *MTD,* **CL-9**, paras. 205-206.\n\n653.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that even if permits and zoning changes could be equated *(quod non*), Claimants\u2019 claim would nevertheless fail, because there has been no violation of Article 3(2).611\n\nR-II, paras. 324-334.\n\n654.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Article 3(2) requires that permits be granted \"in accordance with the host state\u2019s laws and regulations\", which places an obligation of conduct on the Contracting Parties - and not an obligation of result.612 Respondent explains that, in the present case, such obligations as it might have pursuant to Article 3(2) were honoured: the issuance, challenge and annulment of the Zoning Plan Change and the termination of its procurement all occurred in full conformity with Czech law.613\n\nR-PHB, para. 164, referring to *MTD,* **CL-9**, para. 206 (\"Article 3(2) of the Croatia BIT [...] is an assurance to the investor that the laws will be applied, and to the state a confirmation that its obligation under that article is confined to grant the permits in accordance with its own laws.\").\n\nR-PHB, para. 164.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n655.\n\nClaimants allege that the City of Prague violated the obligations under Article 3 of the BIT by failing to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change, which would have permitted the land purchased by Claimants to be used for residential purposes.\n\n656.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 arguments. According to Respondent, Article 3 refers specifically to the issuance of permits, not the approval of zoning plan changes, and even if Article 3 were applicable to zoning changes, there still would be no violation, since at all times, Respondent acted in conformity with Czech law.\n\n657.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT addresses the promotion and admission of investments:\n\n\"(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.\"\n\n658.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the BIT specifies one of the ways in which the host State can guarantee the promotion and admission of investments. In particular, the host State shall grant the necessary \"permits\" and \"authorizations\" in connection with investments, in accordance with its laws and regulations:\n\n\"(2) When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment on its territory, it shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment and with the carrying out of licensing agreements and contracts for technical, commercial or administrative assistance. Each Contracting Party shall, whenever needed, endeavour to issue the necessary authorizations concerning the activities of consultants and other qualified persons of foreign nationality.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n659.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the BIT (already referred to in previous sections) prohibits the impairment of investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures. In particular, Article 4(1) requires that the host State issue the necessary \"authorizations\" mentioned in Article 3(2):\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and liquidation of such investments. In particular, each Contracting Party shall issue the necessary authorizations mentioned in Article 3, paragraph (2) of this Agreement.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n660.\n\nThus, the BIT contains a double mandate regarding the issuance of the necessary permits and authorisations:\n\n- A positive obligation under Article 3(2): the host State shall grant \"permits\" in connection with the investment, subject to its laws and regulations; additionally, the host State shall \"endeavour\" to issue the \"authorizations\" required by consultants and other qualified persons; and\n\n- A negative obligation under Article 4(1) in relation to Article 3(2): the host State shall not impair investments by refusing to issue the necessary \"authorizations\" - an obligation which (at least in a literal interpretation) seems to refer to those authorizations required by consultants and other qualified persons to carry out their profession.\n\n661.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent should have applied its existing procedures to re-procure and approve the Zoning Plan Change.614 Claimants emphasise that re-procuring and approving the Zoning Plan Change in this case required no changes to the current laws and regulations and was therefore an obligation under Article 3 of the BIT.615\n\nC-PHB, para. 185.\n\nC -II, paras. 555-557; C-PHB, para. 192.\n\n662.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, argues that Article 3(2) of the BIT applies only to \"permits\", but not to \"zoning changes\", which are rules of general application.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n663.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent.\n\n664.\n\nFirst, the approval by the Prague Assembly of a Zoning Plan Change does not fit within the ordinary definition of \"permit\" or \"authorization.\"\n\n665.\n\nA \"permit\" or \"authorization\" is an administrative act, issued by an administrative authority, granting the beneficiary the right to perform a certain regulated activity.\n\n666.\n\nA zoning plan is a rule of general application approved by the Municipal Assembly (a democratically elected political body), establishing the rules (binding on all citizens) for the proper use of land. Zoning plan changes are, from a legal point of view, amendments to rules of general application, which also require approval by the Municipal Assembly.\n\n667.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the distinction between rules pertaining to land use planning and the issuance of permits has been discussed by prior ICSID tribunals. In *UAB E Energija,* for example, the tribunal explained:\n\n\"it is doubtful that the concept of a 'necessary permit\u2019 or 'necessary authorisation\u2019 'in connection with the investment\u2019 is to be interpreted and construed so as to include the heat supply development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne, which is part of the management and planning duties of the Municipality; this document was not, in any event, issued by the Municipality as a permit and does not represent an authorisation allowing any particular action on the part of the Operator.\"616\n\n*UAB,* **RL-72**, para. 1107; See also *MTD*, **CL-9**, para. 205.\n\n668.\n\nSecond, even if it is accepted *arguendo* that the re-procurement of a zoning plan change can be equated with the issuance of a permit *(quod non),* the only obligation which Article 3(2) puts on the shoulders of the host State is to grant such permits \"in accordance with its laws and regulations.\" If, in accordance with municipal law, the investor is not entitled to the permit, no breach of the BIT obligation is committed. Article 3(2) thus creates a simple obligation of conduct on the Contracting Parties - and is not a guarantee of any particular outcome.617\n\nR-PHB, para. 164, referring to *MTD,* **CL-9**, para. 206 (\"Article 3(2) of the Croatia BIT [...] is an assurance to the investor that the laws will be applied, and to the State a confirmation that its obligation under that article is confined to grant the permits in accordance with its own laws.\").\n\n669.\n\nIn the present case, the Czech Republic did adhere to the obligations imposed by Article 3(2): the issuance, challenge and annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, and the termination of its procurement, all occurred in full conformity with Czech law.618\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nR-PHB, para. 164.\n\n670.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants\u2019 claim that the Respondent violated the obligation to \"grant the necessary permits\" under Article 3(2) of the BIT.\n\n**VII.3.****BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n671.\n\nClaimants argue that the City of Prague\u2019s termination of the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change amounted to an indirect expropriation in violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT.619\n\nC-I, paras. 306-322; C-II, paras. 133-142; C-PHB, para. 168.\n\n672.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarise the Parties\u2019 positions [**1.** and **2.**] and then set out its decision [**3.**].\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n673.\n\nAccording to Claimants, it is common ground that the BIT\u2019s protections extend to indirect expropriation - which includes the taking of the commercial value of an investment by measures that \"neutralize the benefit of the property of the foreign owner.\"620 Claimants refer to case law in support of the view that a deprivation or taking of property may occur through interference by a State with the use of the property or with the enjoyment of the benefits of the property.621\n\nC-PHB, para. 169, referring to *CME,* **CL-25**, paras. 591, 604. Also referencing *Goetz,* **CL-67**, para. 124 (measures depriving investors of the benefit which they could have expected from their investments qualify as measures \"having the same effect\" as an expropriation).\n\nC-PHB, para. 169, referring to *Wena Hotels,* **CL-64**, para. 98; *Tippets,* **CL-65**, para. 225.\n\n674.\n\nClaimants argue that if Benice had not filed the Annulment Request, and if the City of Prague had not terminated the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, then the Project Area would have remained zoned for residential development and Claimants would have realized their investments.622\n\nC-PHB, para. 169.\n\n675.\n\nClaimants argue that this is enough to establish expropriation, which only requires that an investor show \"that the rights that it would otherwise enjoy have been substantially impacted or that it has been deprived of control over or access to the economic use of its investment.\"623\n\nC-PHB, para. 172, referring to *Standard Chartered,* **CL-111**, para. 277. See also *Metalclad,* **CL-33**, para. 103 (indirect expropriation includes \"interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property\") [emphasis added]; *Middle East Cement*, **CL-66**, para. 107; C. Scheurer, Rapport: \"Concept of Expropriation under the ECT and other Investment Protection Treaties\" in: C.

Myers,* **CL-49,** para. 283.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n679.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 allegations and argues that the Czech Republic did not expropriate Claimants\u2019 alleged investments in violation of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n680.\n\nRespondent emphasises the fact that Claimants\u2019 purchase of land took place before the land was zoned for residential development. This is critical, argues Respondent, because it means that Claimants allege the expropriation of rights that they had never actually acquired.627\n\nR-PHB, para. 223; R-II, paras. 442.\n\n681.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the creation and acquisition of rights (which are later protected by the BIT) is a matter of Czech law. Respondent notes that Czech Courts have consistently confirmed that there is no subjective right of an owner to have its property included within a certain zoning category.628 Claimants\u2019 expropriation claims must be dismissed, since the only rights acquired by Claimants were property rights over agricultural lands and brownfield sites.629\n\nR-PHB, para. 225, referring to *Vestey Group,* **RL- 16**, para. 194; *Emmis,* **RL-109**, para. 162.\n\nR-PHB, para. 224.\n\n682.\n\nRespondent adds that, even assuming Claimants held vested rights capable of being expropriated *(quod non),* Claimants have still failed to prove any interference with their property rights of a sufficiently restrictive, permanent, and irreversible nature to justify a finding of indirect expropriation.630\n\nR-II, paras. 443-476; R-PHB, para. 227\n\n683.\n\nFurthermore, even if there had been a restrictive interference with Claimants\u2019 alleged property rights, this was neither permanent nor irreversible, as would be required to establish expropriation.631 Moreover, Respondent notes that Claimants have acknowledged that they consider that the development of the Project is still possible.632\n\nR-PHB, para. 229, referring to *Tza Yap Shum,* **CL-69**, para. 163.\n\nR-PHB, para. 124-127, referring to HT 222:2-8.\n\n684.\n\nFinally, Respondent notes that Claimants remain the owners of the exact same agricultural land and brownfield sites that they purchased in 2007, and that they remain entitled to initiate a procedure that could lead to a future zoning change.633\n\nR-PHB, para. 231.\n\n685.\n\nRespondent argues that, in any event, the police powers doctrine - which stipulates that regulatory activity of a State is not compensable - would further prevent any finding of a compensable expropriation.634\n\nR-II, paras. 477-492; R-PHB, paras. 234-235, quoting *Quiborax*, **RL-110**, para. 202.\n\n686.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Prague City Assembly\u2019s decision to terminate the procurement was a legitimate exercise of its democratic mandate and was taken as part of the State\u2019s regulatory powers over land use and development. Thus, according to Respondent, the police powers doctrine prevents any finding of a compensable expropriation in this case.635\n\nR-PHB, para. 237.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n687.\n\nClaimants submit that if Benice had not filed the Annulment Request, and if the City of Prague had not terminated the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change, then, first, the Project Area would have remained zoned for residential development and Claimants\u2019 property would not have lost almost all of its value, and, second, that these developments constitute an indirect expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in violation of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n688.\n\nRespondent disagrees. It alleges that Claimants never acquired rights capable of being expropriated, and even if they had, they never suffered a substantial or permanent or irreversible deprivation of their assets sufficiently serious to constitute an indirect expropriation.\n\n689.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin by establishing the proper interpretation of Article 6(1) [**A.**] and will thereafter provide its reasoning for dismissing Claimants\u2019 claims of expropriation [**B.**].\n\nA. **Interpretation of Article 6(1)**\n-------------------------------------\n\n690.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the BIT records the guarantee provided to investors against unlawful expropriation in the following terms:\n\n\"Neither Contracting Party shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, and under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation. The amount of compensation, interest included, shall be settled in the currency of the country of origin of the investment and paid without delay to the person entitled thereto without regard to its residence or domicile.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n691.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the BIT contains a general prohibition against three types of taking by the host State:\n\n- expropriation,\n\n- nationalisation, and\n\n- other measures having the same nature or the same effect.\n\n692.\n\nThe term \"measures\" is not defined in the BIT, but it is generally accepted that it encompasses all\n\n- administrative acts taken by the Czech State, including its agencies and territorial bodies; and\n\n- legislative acts of general application formalised as laws approved by Parliament or as decrees or other regulations authorised by the Government, and\n\n- judicial decisions.\n\nExpropriation and nationalisation\n---------------------------------\n\n693.\n\nThe BIT does not provide a definition of \"expropriation\" or \"nationalisation\", but the terms are well established international law concepts.\n\n694.\n\nIn an \"expropriation\" a State, exercising its sovereign powers, dispossesses an investor of a protected investment, depriving the investor of the use and benefit (but not necessarily of the ownership or title) of the investment. The definition of expropriation is centered on the taking suffered by the investor: there is no requirement that the investor\u2019s loss should translate into enrichment of the State (or of the State\u2019s designee) - although typically expropriations will result in wealth passing from the investor to the State, to a public entity, or to a private beneficiary favored by the State.\n\n695.\n\n\"Nationalisation\" is a concept analogous to expropriation, whereby control of the expropriated assets, usually entire industrial sectors of the economy, or covering certain types of natural resources, is taken over by the State or by a State-controlled entity.636\n\n*OI European,* **RL-64**, para. 328, referring to I. Brownlie, *Principles of Public International Law,* 7th Ed., 2008, p. 532.\n\nIndirect expropriation or equivalent measures\n---------------------------------------------\n\n696.\n\nIn the past, takings of alien property usually took the form of direct expropriations, *i.e.,* by overt administrative or legislative measures declaring the State\u2019s decision to dispossess the foreign investor. Such direct expropriations have, however, become less frequent,637 while the number of so-called \"indirect expropriations\" has increased.638 These \"indirect expropriations\" are characterized by State interferences - sometimes formalised as legislative acts of general application, other times as administrative or tax measures - which result in the destruction or significant erosion of the value of the investor\u2019s assets, without the outright taking of the property.639\n\nB. Stern, \"In Search of the Frontiers of Indirect Expropriation\" in A.W. Rovine, *Contemporary Issues in International Arbitration and Mediation,* Fordham Paper 2007, pp. 31-53.\n\nA.K. Hoffmann, \"Indirect Expropriation\" in A Reinisch, *Standards of Investment Protection,* 2008, p. 151.\n\nUNCTAD, *Taking of Property,* Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements, 2000, p. 20.\n\n697.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the BIT acknowledges this shift and (like most bilateral and multilateral investment treaties) extends the scope of protection to cover indirect expropriations, defined as \"measure[s] having the same nature or the same effect\" as an expropriation or nationalisation. Other treaties use similar definitions, referring to \"measures equivalent to\" or \"tantamount to\" expropriation.640 Whatever the precise wording, when treaties use these terms, they refer to measures which substantially deprive the investor of the fundamental attributes of property, including the right to use, enjoy and dispose of its investment, without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.641\n\nThere is widespread inconsistency in the terms used to describe these legal concepts; but it is commonly held that \"indirect\", \"creeping\", \"*de facto*\", \"disguised\", and \"regulatory\" expropriation are used interchangeably. See P Muchlinski, F Ortino and C Schreuer, *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law,* 2008, p. 422; C McLachlan, L Shore, and M Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles,* Oxford 2007, CL-1, p. 292.\n\nSee *e.g.,* the definition contained in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada, and the European Union and its Member States, 30 October 2016, Annex 8-A, 1(b).\n\nB. **Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n698.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent.\n\n699.\n\nNeither the decision of Benice to request the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change, nor the decision of the Assembly to terminate the procurement provoked an indirect expropriation of Claimants\u2019 protected investments. The Tribunal grounds its decision on the following reasons:\n\n700.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that Claimants purchased the land before it was re-zoned for residential use. The land the subject of the purchases was land designated as agricultural, forest and for recreational use.\n\n701.\n\nThe Zoning Plan Change, which would have authorised residential development, was approved in 2010, two years after the purchases, but the decision of the Assembly never became final and definitive, there being a two-year statute of limitations for annulment requests. Within that period of limitations, Benice and two affected neighbours filed the Request for Annulment, and the Courts eventually decided that the Zoning Plan Change was contrary to Czech law and it had to be annulled. The Assembly then decided not to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change, leaving the land with the same zoning designation which it had at the time of the purchase.\n\n702.\n\nThe summary of the facts shows that Projekt Sever never had an acquired right that the Project Area be considered as residential. At best, after the initial approval of the Zoning Plan Change by the Assembly, it had an expectation that, if the period of limitation lapsed and no annulment request was filed (or the request was filed but rejected), the approval would become final, and the land would then definitively be considered as zoned for residential use.\n\n703.\n\nBut that expectation did not materialize.\n\n704.\n\nThus, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent, and finds that the only rights acquired by Claimants through their land purchases were property rights over agricultural, forest and recreational land.642\n\nR-PHB, para. 224.\n\n705.\n\nSecond, even if Claimants had acquired a specific right for the Project Area to be zoned for residential use *(quod non),* Claimants have still failed to prove any interference with their property rights that would be sufficiently restrictive, permanent and irreversible to justify a finding of indirect expropriation.\n\n706.\n\nAs noted by Respondent, Claimants remain the owners of the same land that they purchased in 2007 and they remain entitled to initiate a procedure that could lead to a future zoning change.643 Although the short-term political climate may have worked against Claimants, there is still a possibility that the land may eventually be designated as residential.644 The Tribunal notes that Claimants themselves acknowledge that the new draft Metropolitan Plan designates at least 10% of the Project Area as susceptible to development.645\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nR-PHB, para. 231.\n\nR-PHB, para. 124-127, referring to HT 222:2-8.\n\nC-PHB para. 180.\n\n707.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants\u2019 claims of indirect expropriation under Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n708.\n\nIn summary, the Arbitral Tribunal has only found one violation of the BIT attributable to the Czech Republic: the payment requests made to Projekt Sever on behalf of Benice District were unreasonable pursuant to Article 4(1) of the BIT. They also fall short of the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment that Article 4(2) requires the Respondent to ensure.\n\n**VIII.** **REPARATION**\n------------------------\n\n709.\n\nIn this section the Tribunal will discuss the reparation due to Claimants as a consequence of the breach committed by the Czech Republic in violation of its Treaty obligations.\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **C****laimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nAccording to Claimants, a State must make full reparation if it commits an international wrong. Reparations must wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.646\n\nC-I, paras. 323-335; C-II, para. 560, referring to *Chorz\u00f3w,* **CL-73**, para. 124.\n\n711.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent must pay monetary compensation sufficient to compensate them in full for the loss caused by the Respondent\u2019s violations of the BIT, including compensation for lost profits.647\n\nC-II, para. 560, citing to *Flemingo DutyFree,* **CL-37**, para. 865.\n\n712.\n\nClaimants rely on their economic expert, Mr. Kai F. Schumacher of AlixPartners, for their assessment of the quantum of the damages caused by their inability to realise the development of the Residential Complex Benice.648\n\nC-I, para. 356.\n\n713.\n\nMr. Schumacher\u2019s analysis concluded that the Claimants\u2019 total damages amount to CZK 4,950,382,717 as of the valuation date specified in the report (31 July 2020).649\n\nC-I, para. 357; Schumacher ER I, pp. 1-2.\n\n714.\n\nAccording to Claimants, these damages represent the lost profits that Claimants would have received, had the Residential Complex Benice been successfully developed, as well as damages suffered by the Claimants due to the loss in the value of the land acquired for the development.650\n\nC-I, para. 356 *et seq.*; C-III, paras. 575 *et seq.*\n\n715.\n\nIn their Post Hearing Brief, Claimants updated the quantum of their claim for damages, requesting that the Tribunal award compensation, including pre-award interest as of 31 July 2020, in the amount of CZK 5,266,622,342.651\n\nC-PHB, p. 2.\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **R****espondent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n716.\n\nAccording to the Czech Republic, the damages alleged by Claimants are not recoverable under the settled principle of international law that hypothetical or speculative damages are not recoverable.652\n\nR-I, paras. 397-399; R-II, para. 493.\n\n717.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 claims for loss of profit are purely speculative, noting that those claims are dependent on at least six successive steps and that Claimants have not proven that those steps would have more likely than not been fulfilled.653\n\nR-PHB, para. 243.\n\n718.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants\u2019 arguments on damages skip over two critical steps:\n\n- that losses must be proven with \"sufficient certainty to be compensable,\"654 and\n\n- that the harm must be caused by the respondent State.655\n\nR-II, para. 496, referring to International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries, 2001, **CL-5,** Article 36, comment 27 (\"In cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable\"); M. Whiteman, Damages in International Law, Vol. III, Government Printing Office Washington (excerpts), 1943, **RL-120**, p. 1837; UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, 2010, **RL-121**, Article 7.4.3(1); United Nations Compensation Commission, \"Governing Council Decision 9\", 6 March 1992, **RL-122**, paras. 8, 19.\n\nR-II, para. 496.\n\n719.\n\nThus, according to Respondent, Claimants have failed to prove that they actually suffered any loss, because the Project and its realisation remained nothing more than a concept.656\n\nR-II, paras. 497-529.\n\n720.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2019 claims for loss of land value, Respondent argues that these claims must also fail, because there has been no actual loss: Claimants purchased agricultural land in 2007-2008 and they still own that agricultural land today. While it is true that Claimants paid a higher price for that land as prospective building land, it still may be considered as prospective building land.657\n\nR-II, para. 532.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n721.\n\nThe Tribunal has accepted one of Claimants\u2019 claims, while it has dismissed the remainder.\n\n722.\n\nThe claim accepted by the Tribunal relates to Mayor Topicova\u2019s requests, on behalf of the District of Benice, demanding significant payments from Projekt Sever as *quid pro quo* for the withdrawal of the Benice Lawsuit filed by the District against Projekt Sever, and for the District\u2019s change of position regarding the increase in the density coefficient. In the opinion of the Tribunal, this conduct resulted in the breach of the specific prohibition of unreasonable measures established in Article 4(1) and of the general FET standard guaranteed in Article 4(2) of the BIT.\n\nThe consequences of internationally wrongful acts\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n723.\n\nArticle 30 of the ILC defines the first obligation arising from internationally wrongful acts:\n\n- the State is obliged to cease that act, if it is ongoing, and\n\n- the State must offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances so require.\n\n724.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the wrongful act is not ongoing, and that Claimants do not seek assurances or guarantees that it will not be repeated.\n\n725.\n\nAs a second consequence, Article 31 of the ILC Articles requires that the delinquent State make \"full reparation\" for the \"injury caused\":\n\n\"Article 31 Reparation\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the international wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State\"\n\n726.\n\nArticle 36 of the ILC Articles then establishes that full reparation may take three forms:\n\n- Restitution, which in accordance with Article 35 requires the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed to be re-established;\n\n- Compensation for the damages caused, which under Article 36, include loss of profits insofar as they are established; and\n\n- Satisfaction, which may consist in an acknowledgement of the breach, an expression of regret, a formal apology, or another appropriate modality, as established in Article 37.\n\n727.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants are requesting full reparation in two forms:658\n\n- First, Claimants are requesting compensation for the damages caused, including the loss in the value of the land acquired for the development and loss of profits and interest, in an amount of CZK 5,266,622,342 (**A.**), and\n\n- Second, Claimants also seek a declaration by the Tribunal that \"the Czech Republic\u2019s actions and omissions at issue, including those of its instrumentalities for which it is internationally responsible\" violated Article 4 of the BIT by \"failing to treat Claimants\u2019 investments fairly and equitably\" and by \"impairing Claimants\u2019 investments through unreasonable and discriminatory measures\" (**B.**).\n\nC-PHB, p. 2/76.\n\nA. **Compensation**\n-------------------\n\n728.\n\nThe duty to make reparation extends only to those damages which have been proven by the injured party and which are legally regarded as the consequence of the wrongful act. It is a general principle of international law that injured claimants bear the burden of demonstrating:\n\n- That the claimed *quantum* of damage was actually suffered, and\n\n- that such damages flowed from the host State\u2019s conduct, and that the causal relationship was sufficiently close *(i.e.,* not \"too remote\").659\n\n*Lemire,* **RL-83**, para. 155.\n\n729.\n\nArticle 36.1 of the ILC Articles reflects this general principle:\n\n\"The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby [...]\" [Emphasis added]\n\n730.\n\nClaimants fail on both counts:\n\n731.\n\nFirst, Claimants have failed to prove that the wrongful acts of the Czech Republic caused any damage at all.\n\n732.\n\nThe wrongful conduct attributable to the Czech Republic consists in the Mayor of Benice\u2019s irregular and improper requests demanding that Claimants make significant payments in return for the withdrawal of the Benice Lawsuit filed by the District against Projekt Sever, and for the District\u2019s change of position with respect to the increase in the density coefficient. Claimants (to their credit) refused to make the wrongful payments.\n\n733.\n\nThere is no evidence that the internationally wrongful conduct attributable to the Czech Republic caused any harm to Claimants:\n\n- Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 did not withdraw the Benice Lawsuit, but the action was dismissed on 8 March 2012 by the District Court, and Benice\u2019s subsequent appeal was also dismissed;660 Projekt Sever does not allege that it has suffered any harm due to the filing and subsequent dismissal of the Benice Lawsuit, nor is there any evidence in the file to suggest that it did;\n\n- Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 voluntarily changed her position regarding the density coefficients, and Benice finally supported Projekt Sever\u2019s request for an increase in May 2011- preempting any claim for damages.661\n\nSee paras. 118-120 *supra.*\n\nSee paras. 110-112 *supra.*\n\n734.\n\nSecond, Claimants seek compensation for the damages allegedly caused, including loss of profits and interest, in an amount of CZK 5,266,622,342 - a *quantum* established with the support of their expert, AlixPartners.\n\n735.\n\nClaimant\u2019s alleged damages are based on the premise that the Annulment Decision adopted by the Czech Courts, and the subsequent decision by the Prague City Assembly to terminate the re-procurement of the Zoning Change, destroyed the value of Claimants\u2019 investment and left Projekt Sever with agricultural and forest land and land for recreational use that could not be used for the development of the Benice Housing Complex.662\n\nSee paras. 713-715 *supra.*\n\n736.\n\nThe problem with this quantification is that it assumes that the damage was caused by two events, which the Tribunal has found do not constitute internationally wrongful acts attributable to the Czech Republic:\n\n- The filing by the District of Benice of the Annulment Request, and the subsequent adoption of the Annulment Decision by the Czech Courts, which annulled the Zoning Plan Change,663\n\n- And the decision by the Prague City Assembly not to re-procure the annulled Zoning Plan Change, with the consequence that the Project Area would continue to be zoned for agricultural, forest and recreational use.664\n\nSee paras. 385-391 *supra.*\n\nSee paras. 478-488 *supra*.\n\n737.\n\nThus, the Tribunal does not find any causal link between the internationally wrongful conduct attributable to Respondent and the damages claimed by Claimants.\n\nB. **Satisfaction**\n-------------------\n\n738.\n\nA State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused, if requested by the injured, and insofar as the injury cannot be remedied by restitution or compensation. The only limitation (identified in Article 37(3) of the ILC Articles) is that the satisfaction shall not be out of proportion to the injury and may not take a form humiliating to the responsible State.\n\n739.\n\nThe Tribunal has already dismissed Claimants\u2019 request for compensation, and notes that restitution has not been requested (and is not feasible, given the nature of the wrongful act). Claimants do request a form of satisfaction, a declaration by the Tribunal that the Czech Republic has committed a violation of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n740.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that such a declaration is proportionate to the injury caused, is not humiliating for the responsible State, and consequently agrees to give satisfaction to Claimants, by making the appropriate declaration in the *dispositif* of this Award (excluding any reference to discriminatory conduct, since the Tribunal has dismissed Claimants\u2019 claims regarding discrimination).\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n741.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants\u2019 claim for compensation, due to a lack of substantiation and the absence of causation. Conversely, the Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 claim for satisfaction in the form of a declaration by the Tribunal, to be inserted in the *dispositif* of this Award, that the Czech Republic has committed an internationally wrongful act consisting of a violation of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n**IX.** **COSTS**\n-----------------\n\n742.\n\nRule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules establishes that:\n\n\"The award shall be in writing and shall contain [...] (j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n743.\n\nThe Parties submitted their statements of cost on 6 August 2020.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis annulment proceeding concerns an application for annulment (\"Application\") of the award rendered on November 1, 2021, in the arbitration proceeding between Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever s.r.o. and the Czech Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/11) (\"Award\" in the \"Arbitration\") rendered by a Tribunal composed of Prof. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, Mr. John Beechey, and Prof. Vaughan Lowe KC (\"Tribunal\").1 The Applicants and the Respondent on Annulment are collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n*Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever s.r.o. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/11, Award, November 1, 2021, **A-1** (\"***Pawlowski*** **Award**\") (available at https://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C6327/DS16910\\_En.pdf).\n\n2.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal decided a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the Swiss Confederation on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed on October 5, 1990 (\"BIT\" or \"Treaty\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\").\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute in the original proceeding related to the Applicants' investment in a large-scale real estate development project (the \"Project\") in the borough of Benice in Prague, Czech Republic (\"borough of Benice\" or \"Benice\").\n\n4.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction over the dispute, declared that the Czech Republic violated Article 4 of the BIT, and dismissed all other claims. The Tribunal awarded no compensation to the Claimants. It also declared that each Party was to bear its own legal fees and expenses and in equal parts the costs of the proceeding.\n\n5.\n\nThe Applicants applied for partial annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, identifying two grounds for annulment: (i) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (ii) failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn February 26, 2022, ICSID received an application for annulment of the Award from Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever s.r.o. of the Award (\"Application\").\n\n7.\n\nOn March 9, 2022, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary- General of ICSID registered the Application.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated May 23, 2022, in accordance with Rules 6 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Jacomijn van Haersolte-van Hof, a national of the Netherlands, appointed to the Panel by the Netherlands, and designated as President of the Committee, Yoshimi Ohara, a national of Japan, appointed to the Panel by Japan, and David Pawlak, a national of Ireland and the United States of America, appointed to the Panel by the Slovak Republic had been constituted (\"Committee\"). On the same date, the Parties were notified that Mr. Alex B. Kaplan, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n9.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a first session with the Parties on July 19, 2022, by video conference. The following participants attended the session:\n\n*Members of the Committee:*\n\nProf. Dr. Jacomijn J. van Haersolte-van Hof, President of the Committee  \nMs. Yoshimi Ohara, Member of the Committee  \nMr. David A.

PO1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. PO1 also sets out a procedural calendar for the proceeding.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with PO1, on December 1, 2022, the Applicants filed a memorial on partial annulment, together with Exhibits A-1 through A-46, and Legal Authorities ALA-1 through ALA-21 (\"Memorial\").\n\n12.\n\nOn April 3, 2023, the Respondent filed a counter-memorial on partial annulment, together with Exhibits RA-1 through RA-7 and Legal Authorities RLA-1 through RLA-34 (\"Counter-Memorial\").\n\n13.\n\nOn July 3, 2023, the Applicants, filed a reply on partial annulment, together with Exhibit A-47 and Legal Authorities ALA-22 through ALA-34 (\"Reply\").\n\n14.\n\nOn October 3, 2023, the Respondent filed a rejoinder on partial annulment, together with Exhibit RA-0008 to RA-0011 and Legal Authorities RLA-0035 to RLA-0046 (\"Rejoinder\").\n\n15.\n\nOn November 27, 2023, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the then-scheduled hearing.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, ICSID notified the Parties of the Applicants' default on the payment of the advance requested on October 12, 2023. Either Party was invited to pay the outstanding advance pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 16. The Committee notified the Parties in the same communication that if the payment was not received, \"a deferral of the January hearing is likely\" to ensure \"that the funds presently held in trust are not eroded by non-refundable hearing expenses.\"\n\n17.\n\nOn December 5, 2023, the Committee notified the Parties of cancellation of the hearing since no payment was received. The Committee indicated that the hearing would be rescheduled once the outstanding payment was received.\n\n18.\n\nOn January 17, 2024, ICSID Secretary-General suspended the proceeding for non-payment of the required advances pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 16(2)(b).\n\n19.\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the proceeding was resumed following the Applicants' payment of the required advance.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing resumption of the proceeding, on April 22, 2024, the Committee indicated its availability to reschedule the hearing. Following discussions with the Parties, a new hearing date was set.\n\n21.\n\nA rescheduled hearing on partial annulment was held at Hotel Almanac X Alcron, Prague, Czech Republic, on September 10, 2024 (\"Hearing\").

LEGAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO THE APPLICATION**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nBefore addressing the Applicants' individual grounds for annulment, the Committee considers the positions of the Parties regarding the standards of review to be applied to the grounds invoked; namely, Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention for a failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based.\n\n**A. General Principles Applicable in Annulment Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Applicants explain that the grounds for annulment are circumscribed by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and each ground should be interpreted in its ordinary meaning and informed by the decision-making of annulment committees. According to the Applicants, there is consensus among prior committees that Article 52 is to be interpreted \"neither narrowly nor broadly,\" or put another way, \"neither restrictively nor extensively.\"2\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b642-43, citing *Perenco Ecuador Limited v.

Saint Lucia* where the committee stated, \"The provisions in Article 52 may be described as exceptional in the sense that Article 52 provides limited grounds for annulment but that has no impact on the way the provisions are to be applied by the Committee.\"5\n\nReply, \u00b642.\n\nReply, \u00b646, quoting *RSM*, \u00b6151, **ALA-25**.\n\n28.\n\nThus, for the Applicants, interpretation of Article 52 is neither restrictive nor broad, and there is no presumption in favor of or against annulment. The Applicants point also to *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, where the committee observed that \"[s]ome commentators have suggested that in case of doubt, an annulment committee should decide in favour of the validity of the award. Such presumption, however, finds no basis in the text of Article 52 and has not been used by annulment committees.\"6\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b647-48, quoting *Soufraki*, \u00b622, **ALA-12**.\n\n29.\n\nWhile the Applicants acknowledge that the Committee does possess discretion not to annul the award or to decide whether an award is annulled in part or in whole7, they maintain that\u2014in line with consistent ICSID *ad hoc* committee practice\u2014if a ground for annulment is established, then the Committee \"should always\" annul in whole or in part.8\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b649-51, quoting *Rumeli*, \u00b677.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b652-53, quoting *Perenco* \u00b6 63, RLA-9.

Reisman, \"The Breakdown of the Control Mechanism in ICSID Arbitration,\" *Duke Law Journal*, Issue 4 (1989), p. 761, **RLA-36**.\n\n33.\n\nThe Applicants, therefore, are wrong to rely on the few annulment committees, such as *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, which denied that awards are presumed to be valid. The Respondent says that these authorities ignore that \"Article 52 of the ICSID Convention itself provides that annulment is an exceptional mechanism in that it strictly limits annulment to five defined grounds.\"15 It is in this context that committees and scholars have stressed that annulment is \"an extraordinary remedy reserved for cases involving 'egregious violations of certain basic principles.'\"16\n\nRej., \u00b642.\n\nRej., \u00b642, quoting *Cortec Mining Kenya Limited, Cortec (Pty) Limited and Stirling Capital Limited v.

The Respondent again insists, however, that the Applicants are wrong that a committee must annul in whole or in part if a ground for annulment is established. For the Respondent, it is the opposite, in that \"committees may choose not to annul the award even if a ground for annulment is found.\"17 The Respondent relies on the view of the committee in *Orascom v. Algeria* that \"[i]f one of the grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention is established, an *ad hoc* committee still has to consider whether that ground had a material impact on the party seeking annulment.\"18\n\nRej., \u00b643, *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v.

For example, the Respondent cites *AMCO v. Indonesia*, where the committee refused to annul because the error was determined to be *de minimis*. The Respondent also recalls that between 2011 and 2020, there were only eight annulments among 117 annulment proceedings.19\n\nRej., \u00b645.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Committee has carefully considered all the submissions of the Parties and presents herein a non-exhaustive summary of the Parties' primary positions to provide context for the decision.\n\n37.\n\nBefore addressing the specific annulment grounds invoked by the Applicants and the scope of these individual grounds, the Committee briefly addresses the basic framework of an application for annulment. Although certain general concepts and considerations may help shape the Committee's review, ultimately, the scope of review is dictated by the individual legal standards for annulment and the specific grounds invoked. In addition, the Committee observes that both Parties' submissions on the general principles applicable in annulment proceedings are fairly brief and high level, presumably reflecting the limited guidance these general considerations can provide.\n\n38.\n\nA fundamental goal of the ICSID Convention is to assure the finality of awards and to provide limited exceptions to the concept of finality in the interest of fundamental procedural integrity. Annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and annulment proceedings cannot be equated with appeal proceedings. Article 53 of the ICSID Convention makes clear that there are no rights of appeal against awards rendered pursuant to the Convention and that the only remedies are the ones set forth in the Convention itself. Under Article 52(1), the Committee may not engage in an assessment of whether it agrees with the reasoning or conclusions of the Tribunal, but only whether one of the grounds for annulment listed in that Article has been established.20\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b674(1), **ALA-3.**\n\n39.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Applicants that there is no presumption either in favor of or against annulment.21 Furthermore, there is no basis for either an extensive or restrictive interpretation of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.22 Here again, the starting point of the annulment process is the finality of awards.\n\nReply, \u00b647; citing *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v.

Article 52(1)(d): Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIt is the Applicants' position that both Parties agree that the Committee should employ a three-part test in deciding the ground for annulment of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: (i) the procedural rule must be fundamental; (ii) the tribunal must have departed from it; and (iii) the departure must be serious.23\n\nReply, \u00b658, citing to C-Mem., \u00b637; Mem., \u00b6157. See also Applicants' Opening Statement, slide 8.\n\n41.\n\nAs to the relationship between the annulment grounds contained in Article 52(1)(d) and (e), the Applicants submit that while the failure to deal with \"every question submitted to the tribunal\" may result in annulment for lack of reasons under subsection (e), such a failure with respect to, for example, a specific defense, may in certain circumstances also amount to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure regardless of whether such failure also meets the ground under subsection (e).24 The Applicants clarify that a failure to state reasons does not automatically entail a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.25\n\nReply, \u00b680 and Applicants' Opening Statement, slides 12-13, citing *Kl\u00f6ckner*, \u00b6115, **ALA-9**; *Continental Casualty Company v.

The Applicants maintain that the content of the right must be informed by rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.32 According to the Applicants, the right to be heard means that a tribunal \"is not required to provide a detailed answer to every argument and address every piece of evidence but is, on the other hand, required at least to provide reasons why it does not consider these arguments and evidence relevant.\"33\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6188-189.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6188-189; *cf.* Rej., \u00b656.\n\nMem., \u00b6249; Reply, \u00b672, citing *Joksas v.

Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 42.\n\nRej., \u00b650.\n\n47.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Committee must determine whether a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure had a material impact on the outcome of the award, causing the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.36 The Respondent submits its view is not outdated and supported by numerous committees, including the recent *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich v. Venezuela* Committee, \"this Committee considers that 'serious' should be interpreted not as a potential effect but, on the contrary, as a distinguishable material effect on the award.\"37\n\nC-Mem., \u00b639; Rej., \u00b648, citing *Wena Hotels Ltd. v.

Tribunals are entitled to make their own decisions regarding the evaluation and the relevance of the evidence presented by the parties.41 The Respondent here refers to the annulment decision in *Tulip Real Estate v. Turkey*:\n\n*[T]he fact that an award does not explicitly mention an argument or piece of evidence does not allow the conclusion that a tribunal has not listened to the argument or evidence in question. A refusal to listen, amounting to a violation of the right to be heard, can only exist where a tribunal has refused to allow the presentation of an argument or piece of evidence. Therefore, absence in an award of a discussion of an argument or piece of evidence put forward by a party does not mean that a tribunal has violated the right to be heard.*42\n\nTribunals are under no obligation to mention, analyze and comment on each and every piece of evidence.43 The Respondent goes on to state that adopting the Applicants' view\u2014 that all arguments and evidence must be addressed is impractical and would lead to annulment of all awards.44\n\nC-Mem., \u00b641.\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 43.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b646, quoting *Tulip*, \u00b682, **ALA-8** (emphasis added by the Respondent); See also Rej., \u00b658; Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 45, citing *Bernhard von Pezold and others v.

Both Parties agree that the Committee should employ a three-part test in determining whether there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: (i) the rule must be fundamental; (ii) the tribunal must have departed from it; and (iii) the departure must be serious.45 The Parties also agree that the right to be heard qualifies as a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nReply, \u00b658, citing to C-Mem., \u00b637; Mem., \u00b6157. See also Rej., \u00b648\n\n51.\n\nThe Parties differ, however, as to the concrete implementation of the test, first, in relation to the level of the required \"seriousness\" of the departure from the rule in question. Specifically, in advocating what they refer to as a more \"permissive\" approach,46 the Applicants argue that it is enough for an applicant to prove that a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure could potentially have a material impact on the outcome of an award, in which case the seriousness criterion would be fulfilled.47 The Respondent invokes the *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich v. Venezuela* committee decision for the proposition that it is not sufficient that the breach would potentially have a material effect on the award; rather the applicant must show a \"distinguishable material effect on the award.\"48 The Respondent states that even those committees that have deemed a potential different outcome to be sufficient have underscored that the applicant must demonstrate a \"distinct possibility\" that the departure may have made a difference in the tribunal's decision, such that the potential impact on the award must, at least, be evident.49\n\nReply, \u00b665.\n\nReply, \u00b668.\n\nRej., \u00b653.\n\nRej., \u00b655, citing *Perenco \u00b6*137, **RLA-9**.\n\n52.\n\nThis Committee considers that a distinction between a departure from a rule of procedure that potentially would have a material effect on an award from a departure that is shown to have a distinguishable effect is in practice not necessarily clear cut or practicable. Under either interpretation, the analysis involves the comparison of an actual and a hypothetical situation, which brings elements of uncertainty and speculation.\n\n53.\n\nThe second area where there is high level consensus between the Parties, but a diversion in implementation and application, is the scope of the right to be heard, constituting a fundamental rule of procedure. Neither party maintains that the right to be heard requires a detailed review of every argument nor the need to address every piece of evidence. The Applicants further acknowledge that while there is no explicit support in decisions of other *ad hoc* committees for the contrary view, jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights is instructive in determining the boundaries of what constitutes the right to fair trial. Relying on this jurisprudence, the Applicants submit that a tribunal's prerogative not to address specific arguments or evidence should be mitigated by providing reasons for not doing so.50\n\nReply, \u00b680, citing *Kl\u00f6ckner*, \u00b6115, ALA-9\n\n54.\n\nThis Committee does not follow the Applicants in this interpretation. First, several ICSID committees have rejected the notion that tribunals are required explicitly to mention every argument or piece of evidence. As the Respondent submits, the right to be heard does not provide an unlimited opportunity to be heard.51\n\nRej., \u00b657, citing *Von Pezold*, \u00b6255, **RLA-5**.\n\n55.\n\nThe tribunal is required to deal with all claims and/or defenses specifically raised for the tribunal's determination.52 It is the tribunal's prerogative to assess the relevance and importance of the issues at stake and evidence submitted. That does not, however, imply a requirement that *\"a tribunal **[ ]** give express consideration to every argument or issue advanced by a party in support of its position in relation to a particular question*.\"53 The arbiter of relevance is the tribunal, not the parties.54\n\nRej., \u00b661, citing *Continental Casualty*, \u00b692, **RLA-7**.\n\n*Continental Casualty*, \u00b692, **RLA-7**.\n\nSee *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 1, 2009, \u00b6 244, **RLA-8**; *Continental Casualty*, \u00b6 97, **RLA-7****.**\n\n56.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded that this approach amounts to a restrictive interpretation of the right to be heard, nor that the Respondent espouses a restrictive approach.55 Rather, referring to the committee in *Von Pezold*, the Respondent argues that the right to be heard aims to provide parties with a reasonable and fair opportunity to present their case.56 While a \"reasonable and fair\" opportunity provides discretion not to mention, analyze and/or comment on each and every piece of evidence,57 that does not amount to a restrictive interpretation.\n\nReply, \u00b672.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b643.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b644, citing *InfraRed*, \u00b6 771, **RLA-2**.\n\n57.\n\nThe Committee is also not persuaded by the Applicants' reliance on case law of the European Court of Human Rights to assert that the right to be heard imposes an obligation on a tribunal to provide reasons for its determination as to why certain arguments and evidence were deemed irrelevant. Such reasoning would appear to be circular. Requiring a tribunal explicitly to provide reasons why it does not consider arguments and/or evidence to be relevant erodes the tribunal's prerogative to determine which elements are relevant building blocks for its decision, and conversely, which are not. As the committee in *Enron v. Argentine Republic* observed, albeit in the context of Article 52(1)(e), \"[t]he tribunal is required to state reasons for its *decision*, but not necessarily reasons for its *reasons*.\"58\n\n*Enron Creditors et al. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, July 30, 2010, \u00b6222, **RLA-18** (\"***Enron***\").\n\n58.\n\nTo conclude, under Article 52(1)(d) a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure extends to the right to be heard. A tribunal is not required, however, explicitly to consider every argument, issue or evidentiary submission addressed by the parties, or to provide reasons why the tribunal has not done so. At the same time, while the tribunal has discretion to determine which arguments, issues or evidence are relevant, this does not provide a tribunal with *carte blanche* to ignore questions submitted to it, such as specific claims and defenses.\n\n59.\n\nConsequently, it is not possible to provide comprehensive guidance in the abstract regarding the standard contained in Article 52(1)(d). Ultimately, it requires an analysis of each annulment ground invoked, in particular to distinguish between a genuine \"question\" or a claim presented to the tribunal, as opposed to a mere argument, or reference to a particular piece of evidence. The Committee must assess the context, the factual circumstances, and the legal rights invoked, in its interpretation and evaluation of each scenario.\n\n60.\n\nIn some cases, an applicant invoking a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure may also invoke the failure to state reasons on which the award is based pursuant to Article 52(1)(e), which standard will be addressed below. Reasons or the failure to provide reasons, may conceivably be a component of the analysis whether in a particular case a tribunal has violated a fundamental rule of procedure. However, the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) and (e) are distinct and it cannot be said, nor have the Applicants suggested, that the requirement to provide reasons is in and of itself a fundamental rule of procedure. Rather, to justify annulment of an award on the basis of a failure to state reasons, the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) must be fulfilled.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(e): Failure to State Reasons on Which the Award Is Based**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Applicants state that the Parties are in agreement regarding the basic premise that the Article 52(1)(e) ground for annulment relates to the requirement enshrined in Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) that the award contain the decision of the tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons on which the award is based.59\n\nMem., \u00b6168; Rej. \u00b692.\n\n62.\n\nFor the Applicants, a tribunal must provide reasons for the factual and legal premises leading to its decision. Reasons may be implicit \"provided they can reasonably be inferred from the terms used in the decision.\"60 But the Applicants state that a committee's authority to discern implicit reasons is limited. \"[A]n *ad hoc* committee should not construct reasons in order to justify the decision of the tribunal.\"61\n\nReply, \u00b695, quoting *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v.

Applicants' Opening Statement, slide 17.\n\n64.\n\nThe Applicants also catalogue the deficiencies that they say fall within the rubric of this ground for annulment, as follows:\n\n\u2022 *Insufficient reasons*: According to the Applicants, insufficient or inadequate reasons, which are insufficient or inadequate to explain the result arrived at by the tribunal, warrant annulment. Here the Applicants rely on the committee in *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes v. Venezuela*, which observed that this reasoning \"is not substantially different from the holding of the *MINE* annulment committee.\"63\n\n\u2022 *Frivolous reasons*: The Applicants refer to *Perenco v. Ecuador* for the proposition that \"irrelevant or absurd arguments [] supporting a conclusion do not amount to reasons.\"64\n\n\u2022 *Contradictory reasons*: Nor can reasons be contradictory, according to the Applicants. \"Insofar as there are alleged inconsistencies in an award, these cannot lead to annulment unless they are so contradictory that they cancel each other out.\"65 In *Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, the committee added that \"for genuinely contradictory reasons to cancel each other out, they must be such as to be incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the decision.\"66\n\n\u2022 *Failure to address a particular question*: The Applicants agree with the Respondent that it is unreasonable to require a tribunal to address each and every argument made. But the Applicants say that a tribunal is, however, required to address all \"outcome-determinative,\" crucial questions and arguments, meaning those that would have \"altered the Tribunal's conclusions in the Award.\"67\n\nCritically for the Applicants, where \"nothing in the text of the award makes it possible to say with certainty that the tribunal actually considered [the] question and resolved it,\" there has been a failure to address a particular question.68\n\n\u2022 *Failure to address certain evidence*: While the Applicants confirm that a tribunal has no duty to address in the award all evidence on record, it must nonetheless address evidence that is \"highly relevant\" or \"outcome determinative.\" Nor should the tribunal \"simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis\" without analysis or explanation.69\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6106-108, quoting *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Application for Annulment, July 3, 2002, \u00b665, **ALA-13** (\"***Vivendi I***\"). Respondent disagrees with the Applicants' contention that Vivendi lowered the threshold. *See* Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 56.\n\nRej., \u00b665.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent takes particular issue with three points raised by the Applicants. First, committees need not assess the adequacy of a tribunal's reasoning. According to the Respondent, all that is required, as held by authorities on which Applicants rely, is that the tribunal explain its decision in a manner that makes it possible for the parties to understand it. For example, the *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* committee reached this very conclusion when it rejected an annulment application where one could \"easily [ ] understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusion.\"74\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b666-68; Rej., \u00b667, quoting *Soufraki*, \u00b6134, **ALA-12**.\n\n67.\n\nSecond, there is no obligation that a tribunal address all questions and arguments raised by a party.75 It is telling, the Respondent says, that even though ICSID Convention Article 48(3) requires a tribunal to deal with every question submitted to it and state the reasons on which the award is based, only the failure to comply with the latter requirement was elevated to a ground for annulment. The Respondent observes that other breaches of Article 48(3) may be addressed *via* a supplementary decision under ICSID Rule 49.76\n\n*See* C-Mem., \u00b661, citing *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 \u0130n\u015faat \u0130thalat \u0130hracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1, Decision on Annulment, July 14, 2015, \u00b6133, **RLA-19** (\"***K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7***\"). See also Rej., \u00b6 69.\n\nRej., \u00b670; Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 47.\n\n68.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent states that the obligation to deal with every question refers to claims and not each argument put forward in support. Tribunals possess discretion to determine which arguments in support of claims they must address expressly. Citing the decisions of prior committees, the Respondent's view is that tribunals are therefore not required to address arguments that one of the parties deems relevant to the outcome of the award.77\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b671-72, *citing Enron*, \u00b6222, **RLA-18**; Rej., \u00b6 74. See Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 59, citing *Se\u00f1or Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Decision on the Application for Annulment, February 12, 2015, \u00b6110, **ALA-11** (\"***Tza Yap Shum***\").\n\n69.\n\nThird, the duty to provide reasons does not require a tribunal to address all arguments\u2014 even those on which the Parties have placed a significant emphasis\u2014or each piece of evidence. The Respondent says that the Applicants have not rebutted this contention. The Respondent explains that it is in the tribunal's discretion to determine the probative value of evidence and to select which evidence is outcome-determinative. No authority proffered by the Applicants establishes otherwise.78\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b673-79, citing *Global Telecom*, \u00b680, **ALA-22** (\"[i]f a tribunal provides reasons on how and why it reached its decision, there is no room for annulment under Article 52(1)(e)\"); *Rumeli*, \u00b684, **RLA-17** (\"there is no need explicitly to address each and every one of the arguments raised in support of the particular claims, and it is in the discretion of the tribunal not to do so\"); *F\u00e1brica*, \u00b6116, **ALA-31** (\"lack of consideration of a question submitted to a tribunal could amount to a failure to state reasons if no reasons are given by the tribunal for not addressing the question and such question would be determinant for understanding the reasoning of the award\"). See also Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 52.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention provides that a party may request annulment where \"the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\" This annulment ground corresponds to Article 48(3) of the Convention, in its second part: \"the award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons on which it is based.\" Implementing these requirements, Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) reads that \"[t]he award [\u2026] shall contain [\u2026] the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based.\"\n\n71.\n\nAs addressed above in Section III(A), the ICSID Convention favors the finality of awards and provides only limited exceptions to that principle in the interest of fundamental procedural integrity. An annulment is not an appeal, which is of particular relevance in relation to the interpretation and application of the fifth ground for annulment, namely the failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e). The obligation to provide reasons for an award is a cornerstone of a tribunal's obligation. At the same time, in the ICSID system, it is not a function of a committee to conduct a review of the adequacy or correctness of the reasoning of the tribunal in rendering the Award.\n\n72.\n\nAs the committee in *Vivendi I* reasoned:\n\n*[T]he ground of \"failure to state reasons[]\" \u2026 is not qualified by any such phrase as \"manifestly\" or \"serious.\" However, it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an ad hoc committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.*79\n\n*Vivendi I*, \u00b6\u00b664-65, **ALA-13**.\n\n73.\n\nThe decision of the committee in *MINE v. Guinea*, which both Parties have cited, refers to the obligation to state reasons as a \"minimum requirement\" that is not satisfied by \"contradictory or frivolous\" reasons.80 Similarly, the committee in *Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan*, cited by the Applicants, held that reasons that are \"unintelligible or contradictory or frivolous\" fall short of the Article 52(1)(e) standard as does the absence of any reasons.81\n\n*MINE*, \u00b6\u00b65.08-5.09, **ALA-5** (\"[T]he requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention [\u2026] In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\").\n\n*Dogan,* \u00b6262, **RLA-24**.\n\n74.\n\nIn *TECO v. Guatemala*, another case on which the Applicant relies, the *ad hoc* committee observed that\n\n*[A]nnulment of an award for failure to state reasons can only occur when a tribunal has failed to set out the considerations which underpinned its decision in a manner that can be understood and followed by a reader. Article 52(1)(e) may not be used so as to obtain the reversal on the merits of an award for allegedly providing* 82 *incorrect or unconvincing reasons.*\n\n*TECO*, \u00b687, **ALA-16***.*\n\n75.\n\nWhile the reader should thus be able to follow the decision, *ad hoc* committees should not impose a particular mode of expression on tribunals but should defer to their way of expressing the basis for their decisions. As articulated by the committee in *Wena v. Egypt*:\n\n*Neither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal's reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The Tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.*83\n\n*Wena*, \u00b681, **ALA-4**. See also *id*., \u00b683 (\"The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on its merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal's decision.\").\n\n76.\n\nA specific manifestation of (potentially) failing to state reasons is providing contradictory or conflicting reasons, as the committee in *Perenco v. Ecuador* explained.84 However, here too, committees need to be careful not to stray into an impermissible or substantive assessment of the tribunal's reasoning. A mere or apparent inconsistency is not sufficient; annulment may be warranted only where the contradiction in reasons is so fundamental that they \"cancel each other out.\"85 An annulment committee \"should prefer an interpretation which confirms an award's consistency as opposed to its inner contradictions.\"86 In undertaking its review, a committee must \"look to the totality of an award to understand the motivation of the decision, and not just particular parts.\"87\n\n*Perenco*, \u00b6169, **RLA-9**; see also *MINE*, \u00b65.09, **ALA-5**.\n\nSee *Rumeli*, \u00b681, **RLA-17**, *Cube Infrastructure*, \u00b6323, **ALA-26**, *Continental Casualty*, \u00b6103, RLA-7.\n\n*TECO,* \u00b6102, **ALA-16** (citing *CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on the Application for Annulment, June 29, 2005*,* \u00b681).\n\nRej., \u00b668, citing *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Decision on Annulment, April 2, 2021, \u00b6115, RLA-43 (\"***Hydro***\").\n\n77.\n\nFirst, the Committee considers that in delimiting and implementing the review envisaged by Article 52(1)(e), two aspects can be distinguished, the object of the review, and second, how fulsome the analysis by the tribunal needs to be. At the same time, in practice, including as reflected in decisions cited by the Parties, these two aspects often are conflated. Most decisions focus on the appropriateness of the *level* of review, rather than the appropriateness of the *object* of the review.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent refers to a tribunal's \"finding\" as the object of review88 and contends that not every finding is of such significance that failing to provide reasons therefore justifies annulment.89 Citing the committee in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, the Respondent submitted\n\n*arbitral tribunals have no obligation to expressly address, in their awards, every single issue and argument raised by the parties. Tribunals have discretion to focus on those issues and arguments that they find determinative for their decision and not to address in their awards arguments of the parties that they find to be irrelevant. Even more so, making use of that discretion is not by itself a reason for nullification under Article 52.1(e) of the ICSID Convention.*90\n\nC-Mem., \u00b655.\n\n*Rumeli*, \u00b681, **RLA-17**, referring to \"an important *finding.*\"\n\nC-Mem., \u00b661, citing *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, \u00b6133, **RLA-19**.\n\n79.\n\nThe Applicants emphasized the putative *decisive* nature of the \"question\" as establishing the threshold for which aspects of the decision may or may not justify annulment.91 Invoking *TECO v. Guatemala*, the Applicants underscored need for a tribunal at least to \"address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion.\"92\n\nReply, \u00b6118-119, citing *Global Telecom, \u00b6*77*,* **ALA-22** (\"the Tribunal has to deal with every question submitted to it, which, as pointed out by Prof. Schreuer, is to be understood objectively in the sense of a crucial or decisive argument, that is one whose acceptance would have altered the tribunal's conclusions.\"). See also *F\u00e1brica,* \u00b6116, **ALA-31**, referring to \"outcome-determinative arguments\" or similarly in *Teinver*, \u00b6210, **RLA-27,** that \"a tribunal has no duty to follow the parties in the detail of their arguments, and that the sole fact of failing to address one or more of the same does not in itself entail annulment, unless the argument in question was so important that it would clearly have been determinative of the outcome.\"\n\nMem., \u00b6175, citing *TECO*, \u00b6131, **ALA-16**.\n\n80.\n\nThese authorities show that prior committees have imposed similar standards of review under Article 52(1)(e), whether the alleged failure to provide reasons related to an argument or to evidence. Nevertheless, in the subsequent review of the factual grounds invoked, it may be appropriate and helpful to distinguish these two elements. An alleged failure relating to the reasoning may require a different analysis than an allegation that a tribunal disregarded a fact. In practice, the latter may impact the former.\n\n81.\n\nSecond, as to the standard more generally, the Committee notes that while the text is the starting point, the text of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules do not provide complete clarity as to the legal standard, as the committee in *Hydro v. Albania* also observed. Namely, while Article 48(3) of the Convention refers to the requirement \"to deal with\" every question, the obligation to provide reasons refers to the award (\"shall state the reasons upon which *it* is based\" [emphasis added]), rather than to every *question*.93 The text of the relevant provisions do not, therefore, provide comprehensive or unequivocal guidance as to the applicable standard.\n\n*Hydro, \u00b6*119, **RLA-43** (\"a close textual reading of both Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) indicates that the requirement to state reasons and the right to seek annulment for a failure to state reasons, both relate back to the award. The components of the award would seem to be the questions submitted for decision, as distinct from every issue or argument raised by the parties in the proceedings.\") (emphasis in original).\n\n82.\n\nUnsurprisingly, numerous decisions have addressed the interpretation of these provisions and the applicable standard, not always consistently, and in any event always in the specific context of the factual matrix at issue. While these various decisions therefore understandably differ in nuance, they generally support the proposition that there is no need for a tribunal to address every argument or piece of evidence; rather, the threshold is formed by \"outcome determinative\" questions. The Applicants' contention, by reference to text of the Convention and the Rules, that \"if a Tribunal's failure to address a particular question submitted to it might have affected the Tribunal's ultimate decision, this could also amount to a failure,\"94 requires nuancing. The cases discussed, including the cases referred to by the Applicants, show the need to weigh and contextualize the significance of the question allegedly not addressed; a review which should consider the tribunal's overall award, not every reference, consideration, or component of the decision in isolation.\n\nMem., \u00b6173.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Applicants identify eight shortcomings in the Award, which they contend amount to either a failure to provide reasons, a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure, or both.\n\n84.\n\nFor each of these eight alleged issues with the Award, the Applicants set out the relevant procedural background, the underlying facts and considerations in the Award, and the ground for annulment that is claimed. The Respondent has replied in turn. The Parties' positions are therefore summarized below.\n\n**A. Ground 1: The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Address the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 Facebook Post, Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's Testimony, and the Affidavit of Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Applicants explain that Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1, together with Mr. Hepner and the borough of Benice\u2014all represented by the same attorney\u2014filed the Annulment Request seeking to annul the Zoning Plan Change that ultimately brought about the demise of the Project. In the original proceeding, Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's motivations for joining forces with the borough were examined extensively across the written procedure and at the hearing, according to the Applicants.95\n\nMem., \u00b6178-201.\n\n86.\n\nThe Applicants state that in the Arbitration they argued that the borough of Benice's decision to challenge the Zoning Plan Change was not rational; instead, it was \"a decision by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\" and \"very likely an act of revenge against Projekt Sever for not agreeing to make the payments to Benice that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 had demanded.\"96 The Applicants contend that, whereas the Respondent characterized the participation of Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 more organically, and argued that she was an immediate neighbor of the Project who sought to join Benice's lawsuit out of her own self-interest, the evidence revealed that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 had enlisted Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and another neighbor of the Project to join the lawsuit.97\n\nMem., \u00b6181.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6182-183.\n\n87.\n\nAs the written procedure progressed in the Arbitration, the Claimants (now Applicants) proffered Exhibit C-183, a press interview with Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 after the lawsuit had concluded in which she acknowledged that she was contacted by the borough, which \"asked for help in this dispute,\" to seek to reverse the Zoning Plan Change.98\n\nMem., \u00b6184.\n\n88.\n\nAt the hearing, Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 denied that she had been recruited to join forces with the borough and expressly disavowed the content of the press interview. At the hearing she stated, \"I asked whether I could join because I found it logical.\"99\n\nMem., \u00b6186, citing Merits Hr. Tr., January 28, 2020, 659:22-25, **A-30**.\n\n89.\n\nOn May 27, 2020, after the cut off for the submission of new evidence and after the hearing, the Claimants requested leave to submit a new exhibit containing a Facebook post of Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 (\"Facebook Post\"). This exhibit, an April 2, 2015 post on the Facebook page of the Mayors and Independents Political Party, contains a statement by Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 that \"Benice borough knew that if it went into the court case alone it didn't have much chance of winning, so Mrs Topi\u010dov\u00e1 asked two owners of neighboring properties (me and Mr Hepner) for help.\"100\n\nMem., \u00b6188, citing \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 Facebook Post, April 2, 2015, **A-18** (Exhibit C-219 in the original proceeding).\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal, in its Procedural Order No. 5 (\"PO5\"), permitted the Facebook Post to be entered into the record as Exhibit C-219 together with an affidavit to be prepared by Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 addressing the evidence. The Tribunal explained its decision,\n\n*[T]he Knew Evidence pertains to facts which are prima facie relevant and material to the case, because Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's testimony could clarify the dispute between the Parties regarding the real motives behind Mayor Vera Topi\u010dov\u00e1's decision to file the lawsuit that eventually resulted in the annulment of the zoning plan change.*101\n\nIn accordance with PO5, the Facebook Post was produced and Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 proffered an affidavit addressing this evidence.102\n\nMem., \u00b6190, citing PO5, June 16, 2020, \u00b613, **A-40** (\"**PO5**\").\n\nMem., \u00b6192.\n\n91.\n\nIn subsequent Post-Hearing Briefs, the Claimants explained that this evidence showed that the Annulment Request was filed at the sole initiative of the mayor. Indeed, neither Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 nor Mr. Hepner had participated in the zoning plan change process by submitting comments to the borough opposing the change. Nor did they undertake factual inquiries, consult their own lawyers or share in the costs of Benice's lawyer.103\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6193-194.\n\n92.\n\nCritically, the Applicants observe that the Facebook Post and affidavit were referenced only once in the Award\u2014in the procedural history describing PO5. They also observe that Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's name was mentioned only once in the Award\u2014in the statement of facts. The Tribunal did not otherwise address the Facebook Post, the affidavit, or Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's testimony at the hearing in the Award.104\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6202-203.\n\n93.\n\nFor the Applicants, despite that this evidence was duly before the Tribunal, the Award made factual findings that are inconsistent with it. For example, the Facebook Post shows that it was the mayor who made the decision to file the Annulment Request, and not Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 or Mr. Hepner. The Applicants observe that the Tribunal found the opposite to be true: \"But then the District of Benice, led by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, and two residents of Urhineves (and immediate neighbors to the Project area), decided to file the Annulment Request.\"105\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6209, quoting *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6377, **A-1**.\n\n94.\n\nThe Applicants go on to explain the consequence of the failure of the Tribunal to include this evidence in the Award and address it; namely, the Tribunal found no breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty for arbitrary conduct based on its conclusion that the borough acted in concert with Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Hepner.106\n\nMem., \u00b6210.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal was also not persuaded by the Claimants that the decision to file the Annulment Request was an arbitrary act due to the personal retaliation of the mayor. It went on to state, \"[i]f this were indeed the case, such conduct could constitute a breach of the FET standard enshrined in Article 4 of the BIT.\"107 On this basis, the Applicants insist that had the Tribunal considered this evidence, it would have found a violation of Article 4.108\n\nMem., \u00b6211, quoting *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6397, **A-1**.\n\nMem., \u00b6222.\n\n96.\n\nThe Applicants seek annulment on two grounds for the Tribunal's failure to address the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 Facebook Post, her testimony, and her affidavit. Each is addressed in turn in the paragraphs that follow.\n\n97.\n\nFirst, the Applicants seek annulment under Article 52(1)(e) for the Tribunal's failure to state reasons on which the Award was based, i.e., the Tribunal's failure to address the evidence at issue and its failure to deal with every question submitted to it.109\n\nMem., \u00b6224.\n\n98.\n\nOn the Tribunal's alleged failure to address the evidence, the Applicants recall, as stated in *TECO v. Guatemala*, that a tribunal cannot be expected to address each and every piece of evidence in the record\u2014but that this \"cannot be construed to mean that a tribunal can [] gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis [or] explanation [as] to why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or [] unsatisfactory.\"110\n\nMem., \u00b6225, citing *TECO*, \u00b6131, **ALA-16**. Applicants' Opening Statement, slide 31.\n\n99.\n\nThe Applicants stress that this is exactly what happened in the Award. For the Applicants, evidence regarding Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 was addressed by both Parties in every merits submission and was the focus of a post-hearing procedure dedicated to the entry into the record of the Facebook Post and the affidavit.111\n\nReply, \u00b6135.\n\n100.\n\nThe Applicants insist, \"[i]n fact, there is no other evidence that the Parties and the Tribunal paid so much attention to.\"112 As such, the Facebook Post, the affidavit, and Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's testimony falls under \"evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis.\"113 Yet the Tribunal did not consider this evidence in the Award nor explain why it was disregarded. Thus, the Tribunal violated its duty to \"at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion.\"114\n\nMem., \u00b6229.\n\nMem., \u00b6230, citing to *TECO*, **ALA-16**.\n\n*TECO*, \u00b6232, **ALA-16**.\n\n101.\n\nThe Applicants go on to explain that examination of this evidence could have been outcome-determinative in that the Tribunal could have found a violation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty. It also could have impacted the Tribunal's decision on reparations as the Tribunal itself noted that the proposed quantification of damages accounted for the filing of the Annulment Request by Benice.115\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6233-234; Hr. Tr. 22:6-9.\n\n102.\n\nCritically, the Applicants recall that the Tribunal concluded there was no evidence that the filing of the Annulment Request was a retaliatory act by the mayor or otherwise arbitrary. It then stated, as noted above, \"[i]f this were indeed the case, such conduct could constitute a breach of the FET standard enshrined in Article 4 of the BIT.\"116 It is the Applicants' position that the evidence at issue proved that \"it [was] indeed the case\" that the act was retaliatory and arbitrary in breach of the FET standard, and the Tribunal logically would have reached this conclusion if it had taken the evidence at issue into account.117\n\nReply, \u00b6147, quoting *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6 397, **A-1**.\n\nSee Reply, \u00b6151. Hr. Tr. 23:8-16.\n\n103.\n\nThe Applicants recall that there are numerous prior decisions that support the proposition that annulment for a failure to state reasons could be warranted where the tribunal does not address outcome-determinative evidence.118\n\nReply, \u00b6143, citing *TECO*, \u00b6, **ALA-16**; *Vivendi I*, \u00b6163, **ALA-13**; *F\u00e1brica*, \u00b6118, **ALA-31**; *Teinver*, \u00b6210, **RLA-27**; *Tza Yap Shum*, \u00b6110, **ALA-11**.\n\n104.\n\nAdditionally, the Applicants explain, the Committee need not establish what potential effect consideration of the evidence at issue would have had on the Tribunal's ultimate decision, \"[w]hat can be ascertained at the annulment stage is that the Tribunal failed to observe evidence which at least had the potential to be relevant to the final outcome of the case.\"119\n\nMem., \u00b6235, citing *TECO*, \u00b6131, **ALA-16**.\n\n105.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Applicants reject the Respondent's contention that this line of argumentation is raised for the first time in the annulment proceeding.120\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6151-156.\n\n106.\n\nSecond, the Applicants seek annulment, again under Article 52(1)(e), on the basis that, in connection with the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence, the Tribunal failed to address a particular question, while Applicants maintain that it is required that the Tribunal deal with every question submitted to it.121\n\nMem., \u00b6237.\n\n107.\n\nThe Applicants say that there was a dispute over the motives behind the mayor's decision to file the Annulment Request and also over Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's decision to join the lawsuit. The Applicants recall that the Claimants asserted that the mayor manipulated Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Hepner into participating in the Annulment Request. The Respondent, on the other hand, maintained that it was Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 who decided to join the Annulment Request of her own volition due to concerns about the size of the Project.122\n\nMem., \u00b6239.\n\n108.\n\nThe Applicants state that the Tribunal was well aware of this dispute and went so far as to record in PO5, \"Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's testimony could clarify the dispute between the Parties regarding the real motives behind Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's decision to file the lawsuit.\"123 This is a dispute that the Tribunal did not ultimately resolve, say the Applicants.\n\nReply, \u00b6175, quoting PO5, \u00b613, **A-40**.\n\n109.\n\nThe Applicants rely on *Duke Energy v. Peru*, *EDF v. Argentina*, and *MCI v. Ecuador*, which concurred in the view that, if the failure to address a particular question might have affected the Tribunal's ultimate decision, then annulment under Article 52(1)(e) could be warranted.124 Indeed, for the Applicants, had the Tribunal resolved this question, its ruling on Article 4(1) could have resulted in a finding of a violation of Article 4(1) and an award of damages.\n\nMem., \u00b6286, citing *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28, Decision on the Application for Annulment, March 1, 2011, \u00b6228, ALA-14 (\"**Duke**\"); *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v.

Cameroon*, maintain that there is nothing in the text of the Award that explains that this question was considered by the Tribunal in reaching its conclusion on the alleged breach of the FET standard. For the Applicants, the Tribunal's considerations on this key issue are opaque and therefore the Tribunal failed to address this particular question pursuant to Article 52(1)(e).125\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6182-185, citing *Kl\u00f6ckner*, \u00b6150, **ALA-9**. See also Applicants' Opening Statement, slide 33\n\n111.\n\nThird, the Applicants seek annulment under Article 52(1)(d) for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for a violation of their right to be heard.126\n\nMem., \u00b6246.\n\n112.\n\nThe Applicants state that it is established that a party is \"heard\" when its observations are properly examined by the decision-making authority.127 To establish annulment on this ground the Tribunal's failure must be \"serious,\" meaning that it must have produced a material impact on the Award or had the potential of causing the tribunal to render an award substantially different from what it actually decided.128\n\nReply, \u00b6189.\n\nMem., \u00b6254, citing *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. The Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision on the Application for Annulment, February 21, 2014, \u00b699, **ALA-7**; *Tulip*, \u00b678, **ALA-8**; Reply, \u00b6194.\n\n113.\n\nReferring to *Perenco v. Ecuador*, the Applicants argue that while the failure to provide reasons is a distinct ground for annulment, a failure by a tribunal to consider one of the questions submitted to it for decision, such as a specific defense raised by the respondent could amount to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.129\n\nReply, \u00b6199, *Perenco*, \u00b6125, **RLA-9**and *Continental Casualty*, \u00b697, **RLA-7**.\n\n114.\n\nAs stated above, according to the Applicants, if the Tribunal had \"heard\" the evidence in the record and the arguments, there was the potential that the Tribunal would have reached a substantially different outcome\u2014finding of a violation of Article 4(1) and ordering130 accompanying reparations.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6201-202.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nIt is the Respondent's position that no annulment can arise from the Tribunal's purported failure to address the Facebook Post, the hearing testimony and the affidavit of Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1.\n\n116.\n\nFirst, as matter of law, the Respondent contends that a failure to address evidence in the record is not a failure to state reasons pursuant to Article 52(1)(e). The Tribunal was under no obligation to \"justify\" its choice as to which evidence it found to be relevant and which it found not to be relevant. The Respondent points to the Applicants' own authorities, *Tza Yap Shun v. Peru* and *TECO v. Guatemala*, for the proposition that there is no basis for annulment where the Tribunal did not explain why it rejected evidence that was not relevant or outcome-determinative.131 A tribunal has the discretion to choose the evidence which it deems most relevant.132\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b675-78.\n\nSee Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 59, citing *Tza Yap Shum*, \u00b6110, **ALA-11.**\n\n117.\n\nSecond, as a matter of fact, the evidence at issue here was not \"evidence upon which the parties have placed significant emphasis.\"133\n\nC-Mem., \u00b679.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicants' position that \"there was no other evidence that the Parties and the Tribunal paid so much attention to\" is \"nonsense.\"134 That the Facebook Post and affidavit flowed from a procedural order issued after the cutoff date for new evidence and after the hearing is of the Applicants' own doing, according to the Respondent. It is not an indication of the importance or relevance of this evidence to the Tribunal; rather, the Respondent raised a procedural objection to the admission of the Facebook Post and affidavit.135\n\nC-Mem., \u00b680.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b681-82; Rej., \u00b688.\n\n119.\n\nNor is it relevant, according to the Respondent, that the Parties discussed Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's involvement with regard to the Annulment Request throughout the pleadings or that the Respondent raised an objection to the evidence. Her involvement was one of many issues discussed by the Parties, and it was only logical that it was addressed during the written procedure. The objection and the submission of her affidavit were merely an exercise of the Respondent's procedural rights. These steps do not indicate that the evidence at issue was given \"particular emphasis.\"136\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b690-94.\n\n120.\n\nIt is the Respondent's view that the Tribunal never accorded the Facebook Post any special relevance or materiality.\n\n*When a tribunal orders the production of a document, it does so on the assumption that it may be relevant to the issues in dispute. It is only after having received it, and having heard the arguments of the Parties, that, in the exercise of its discretionary power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1), it evaluates its probative value .... The fact that the Tribunal does not refer to it specifically in its reasoning implies that it did not consider it to be material.*137\n\nThus, the Tribunal's acceptance of the evidence into the record is neither an admission by the Tribunal of its importance nor an obligation to address the evidence in the Award.138\n\nC-Mem., \u00b684, quoting *Tulip*, \u00b6150, **ALA-8**.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b684.\n\n121.\n\nThird, the Respondent observes that the significance of the Facebook Post and affidavit cannot rightly be compared to the evidence at issue in *TECO v. Guatemala*. In that case, the tribunal had failed to address four quantum expert reports, wrongly held there was no such evidence on record, and rejected the investor's claim for loss of value.139 This case is distinguishable.140\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b685-86, citing *TECO*, \u00b6\u00b6130-131, **ALA-16**.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b686-91.\n\n122.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal did not disregard any key evidence or wrongly hold no such evidence existed. Instead, the Respondent states that the Tribunal amply justified its conclusions that the District of Benice's filing of the Annulment Request did not constitute a personal and retaliatory decision by the mayor against the Claimants, and, hence, that it did not constitute a breach of Article 4(1). It employed its discretion not to refer to this evidence because it was not material to its decision\u2014this was implicit in the Tribunal's choice not to refer to it.141 The evidence relating to Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 was \"not relevant or necessary for [the Tribunal's] analysis.\"142\n\nC-Mem., \u00b688.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b689, quoting *TECO*, \u00b6249, **ALA-16**.\n\n123.\n\nFourth, and in any event, nor was the evidence in question \"highly relevant and outcome determinative\" in and of itself. The Respondent states that the evidence does not show \"personal retaliation\" of the mayor. For the Respondent, the Facebook Post shows that Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 was \"happy to have helped in the case and pleased with its outcome.\"143 From this evidence, the Respondent insists that it is \"simply impossible\" to conclude from that the Tribunal would have found that the filing of the Annulment Request was an act of personal retaliation by the mayor, as argued by the Applicants.144\n\nRej., \u00b698, Affidavit of Ms. Silvie \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1, June 29, 2020, \u00b69, **A-41**.\n\nRej., \u00b699.\n\n124.\n\nEven if the Tribunal had concluded that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 had taken the initiative to contact Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1, that would not have changed the Tribunal's overall conclusion on this point. The Respondent observes that the Tribunal, with all the evidence before it, found that,\n\n*[T]he decision to file the Annulment Request was taken by the democratic organ of the District of Benice, its Assembly, not by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 singlehandedly; there is no evidence that the Assembly was aware of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's unsuccessful efforts to extract funds from the developer and there is no evidence that the Assembly's motives were to retaliate against the investor.*145\n\nAdditionally in this regard, both the Assembly and the Courts provided reasoned decisions for their findings nullifying the Zoning Plan Change; there was thus no evidence of retaliation by these organs either.146\n\nRej., \u00b6102, quoting *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6398, **A-1**.\n\nRej., \u00b6102-105.\n\n125.\n\nAs to the alleged \"failure to address a particular question\"\u2014an alternative ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e)\u2014the Respondent avers that this is simply a repackaging of the alleged failure to address evidence. As a matter of law, the ICSID Convention requires only that a tribunal address every claim submitted by a party, and not every argument\u2014put forward in support of every claim.147\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b690-91; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6108, 111.\n\n126.\n\nThis approach was confirmed by the committees in *Duke Energy v. Peru* and *EDF v. Argentina*. In *Duke Energy v. Peru* in particular, the committee stated that a failure to address a specific argument can give rise to annulment only when it renders the award unintelligible.148 The Respondent also asserts that there is also no obligation on a tribunal to \"explain why it rejected arguments or authorities that were not relevant or necessary for its analysis.\"149\n\nC-Mem., \u00b693, citing *Duke*, \u00b6228, **ALA-14**; *EDF*, \u00b6197, **ALA-15**; Rej., \u00b6114\n\nRej., \u00b6112, citing *TECO*, \u00b6249, **ALA-16**.\n\n127.\n\nAs a matter of fact, according to the Respondent, the \"particular question\" put forward by the Applicants\u2014how Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 joined the Annulment Request and the mayor's motives for filing it\u2014was indeed addressed by the Tribunal.150\n\nC-Mem., \u00b694.\n\n128.\n\nBut in any event, this is not a \"particular question,\" instead it was an argument put forward in the context of the Applicants' claim that the filing of the Annulment Request was an act that breached Article 4 of the Treaty.151\n\nC-Mem., \u00b695.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal provided reasons for rejecting this claim, addressing in detail its finding that the filing of the Annulment Request was not retaliatory against Mr. Pawlowski. For the Respondent, the Tribunal's reasoning in this regard \"is perfectly clear.\" It stated, \"it was not persuaded by that argument\" and went on to list \"three reasons\" for reaching this conclusion.152\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6114-115.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Tribunal was under no obligation to address the Applicants' sub-argument regarding Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's own initiative to join the lawsuit.153 In any event, the Respondent recalls that the Tribunal did address this issue by discussing her meeting with the mayor to discuss the potential for her to join in the Annulment Request. Here, the Tribunal examined Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's own testimony and the Minutes and Resolution of the June 21, 2012, Benice District Assembly meeting. These were indeed mentioned only in the Tribunal's statement of facts, but that is of no moment as regards the Applicants' position because an Award must be examined in its entirety.154\n\nC-Mem., \u00b696.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6117-119; see *Hydro*, \u00b6115, **RLA-43**; *Teinver*, \u00b6209, **RLA-27**.\n\n131.\n\nThe Applicants have also failed to show how this point was \"outcome determinative\" in the first place.155 The Respondent rejects the Applicants' contentions that \"[n]egotiations held by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 with Mr. Hepner, Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Bernard took place outside any proper procedure and without any authorisation\" and that, \"had the Tribunal addressed this question it could have found violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT and could have awarded the damages claimed.\"156\n\nC-Mem., \u00b697.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b698, citing Mem., \u00b6\u00b6221-244.\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent contends that this is an entirely new argument that was never advanced in the original proceeding and may not be raised for the first time in the annulment phase.157\n\nC-Mem., \u00b699.\n\n133.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Tribunal addressed the question before it and concluded that the decision to file the Annulment Request was taken by the District of Benice's Assembly \"adhering to proper administrative procedure\" and not by personal retaliation of the mayor.158 Even if the Tribunal had found retaliation by the mayor, the evidence with regard to the District of Benice's Assembly would still stand\u2014and the Tribunal found no motive on the part of the Assembly to retaliate.159\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6100, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6390, 398, **A-1**.\n\nRej., \u00b6122.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Applicants' contention on annulment that the Tribunal's alleged failure to address the Facebook Post, the affidavit, and Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's oral testimony is a violation of the Applicants' right to be heard justifying annulment under Article 52(1)(d).160\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6101.\n\n135.\n\nAs a matter of law, the Respondent observes that the Applicants cannot invoke the Tribunal's purported failure to state reasons to allege a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The two grounds for annulment are distinct. In this regard, the Respondent points to the decision of the *Tulip v. Turkey* committee in support of the view that \"[t]he right to be heard refers to the opportunity given to the parties to present their position. It does not relate to the manner in which tribunals deal with the arguments or evidence presented to them.\"161\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6104, quoting *Tulip*, \u00b682, **ALA-8**.\n\n136.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Respondent's view is that the Applicants were given a full opportunity to present their evidence concerning Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1. Evidence such as the Facebook Post was entered into the record, specifically and at the Applicants' behest, after the hearing. The Respondent adds that the Applicants conceded that evidence regarding Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 was addressed \"in every submission on the merits.\"162\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6107; Rej., \u00b6126.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to say that even assuming the Tribunal's treatment of evidence concerning Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 was a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, it was not a \"serious\" departure. Specifically, the Respondent explains that the motives behind Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's decision to join the lawsuit was not relevant to, and thus could not have altered, the Tribunal's conclusions that the District of Benice's decision to file the Annulment Request was not arbitrary. Nothing in the evidence at issue suggests that the borough's filing of the Annulment Request resulted from a retaliatory personal decision of the mayor, according to the Respondent.163\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6108-109; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6127-128.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe first annulment ground goes to the heart of the dispute before the Committee, and at the same time goes to the core of the Tribunal's decision that while Benice's conduct constituted a breach Article 4 of the BIT,164 the wrongful conduct attributable to the Czech Republic, consisting in the Mayor of Benice's irregular and improper requests for payments, did not cause any harm to Claimants.165\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6362.\n\nMem., \u00b616; see also *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6732.\n\n139.\n\nThe Applicants, in paraphrasing the Award166 state that \"the Tribunal ruled that the Czech Republic breached Article 4 of the BIT by the conduct of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, who made unreasonable requests for Claimants to make certain payments.\" The Award, however, is more nuanced in a material respect, namely in that the Tribunal considered that the relevant question was \"whether the payment requests made by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, *on behalf of the district of Benice*, constitute an unreasonable measure\" resulting in a breach of Article 4 of the BIT.167 The Tribunal expressed sympathy for Mr. Pawlowski's predicament, \"even accepting that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's aim was to obtain monies for the benefit of Benice district.\"168 It further considered that it was not fair that investors be put in a position where they are requested by a public authority to make payments to secure progress of their projects, \"regardless of the motives or the intended use of any funds paid or sought to be procured.\"169\n\nMem., \u00b616.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6361 (emphasis added).\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6368.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6372.\n\n140.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the Claimants argued that the decision to challenge the Zoning Plan Change was not rational; instead, it was \"an act of revenge against Projekt Sever for not agreeing to make the payments to Benice that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 had demanded.\"170 In the Annulment proceedings, the Applicants invoke the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 Facebook Post (Exhibit C-219), Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's testimony and her Affidavit, in support of their allegation that the evidence shows that the Annulment Request was filed at the sole initiative of the Mayor, and that the Award made factual findings that are inconsistent with the evidence.\n\nMem., \u00b6181.\n\n141.\n\nBefore addressing the specific elements of this annulment ground, the Committee recalls that the Tribunal considered it immaterial what were the motives or the intended uses of any funds paid or sought to be procured.171 Consequently, any discussion by the Committee about such motives, findings, or considerations relating thereto which may or may not be inconsistent is *a priori* irrelevant.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6372.\n\n142.\n\nThe Applicants argue, first, that the Tribunal's failure to address the evidence regarding Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 constitutes a failure to state the reasons on which the Award was based,172 as this constitutes evidence on which the Parties have placed significant emphasis. The Committee must first assess what exactly is meant by \"the evidence regarding Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1\"173 because there are three distinct components of this evidence (the Affidavit, the testimony and the Facebook Post) and the argumentation in relation to each is not necessarily identical.\n\nMem., \u00b6224.\n\nMem., \u00b6227.\n\n143.\n\nThe first level of argumentation is that there is no reference to any aspect of the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence. However, as the Respondent points out, the Tribunal did cite the statement of Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and referred to her oral testimony in paragraph 121 of the Award174 so this argument appears to lack a factual basis. In relation to the Facebook Post, the Applicants submit that the only reference to that Post is in the procedural section of the Award (and that that does not suffice). This goes to the extent of the Tribunal's reasoning, which is the Committee addresses below.\n\nRej, \u00b6117.\n\n144.\n\nThe second level of argumentation relates to the issues on which the disputed evidence may have some bearing. More specifically, the Applicants contend that the Tribunal's decision, insofar as it deals with the issues on which the disputed evidence might have shed light, is inconsistent (\"It is more than clear that Tribunal's reasoning in the Award makes factual findings that are completely inconsistent with this evidence.\"175). In addition, the Applicants contend that there is no indication that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 was authorized by the Benice District Assembly to negotiate with residents, including Ms \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1.176\n\nMem., \u00b6205.\n\nMem., \u00b6219.\n\n145.\n\nWhile similar procedural requirements may apply, it is important to distinguish whether the alleged failure of the Tribunal relates to failing to address a piece of evidence or failing to address an argument. As set out above, an allegation that a tribunal disregarded a fact, may require a different analysis than an alleged failure to provide reasoning (see above para. 80). In this case, the Applicants amalgamate the alleged failure to refer to one or more pieces of evidence and the failure of the Tribunal to do justice to the substance of the Applicants' argumentation, including by being inconsistent.\n\n146.\n\nThe Committee now turns to the thrust of the Applicants' submissions. The Applicants submit that the Tribunal's failure to address the three components of the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence resulted in a failure to address certain evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, applying the standard laid down in *TECO v. Guatemala*. In this context, the Committee recalls its observation that the Applicants' argument is not simply that the Tribunal failed to address one or more pieces of evidence; rather, they take issue with the reasoning regarding certain issues which they say the pieces of evidence may have some bearing on.\n\n147.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Respondent that there is no support for the proposition that the evidence at issue here was evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis during the Arbitration, such that the reasoning of *TECO* that is invoked by the Applicants should be applied here.177 There was a procedural skirmish over the production of documents, which led to the Tribunal's admission into the record of a document that had been in existence for some time. This is not a situation in which the Parties (plural) deemed a piece of evidence to be highly relevant to their case. Rather, the Applicants seek support in the evidence, and more specifically in the apparent inconsistency in what may or may not be a material point (namely, who approached whom as to filing or rather joining the Annulment Request), as a building block for arguing that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 acted on her own behalf, without any authorization of the Benice District Assembly and without its knowledge.178\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b685-89.\n\nMem., \u00b6212.\n\n148.\n\nOn its face, it is difficult to see how the Facebook Post and other evidence in any way provide direct support for this allegation. The Applicants contend that there is no indication that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 was authorized by the Benice District Assembly to negotiate with Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Hepner until June 21, 2012, or even that the Benice District Assembly was aware of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's actions and negotiations until June 21, 2012. The disputed evidence is at best tangentially relevant to the issue or issues addressed by the Applicants. In any event, one cannot turn a negative (the absence of a showing of authorization or awareness) into a positive conclusion (the showing of a lack of procedure or authorization). There is no support therefore for the conclusion that \"[n]egotiations held by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 with Mr. Hepner, Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Bernard took place outside any proper administrative procedure and without any authorisation from the Benice District Assembly or of any other administrative body.\"179\n\nMem., \u00b6221.\n\n149.\n\nHowever this may be, the review called for in assessing whether a tribunal has failed to state reasons is not an invitation for an annulment committee to explore \"what if\" scenarios. The reader should be able to follow a decision, and it is appropriate to defer to the tribunal's preferences in expressing the basis for its decision. As stated above (see para. 75), the committee in *Wena v. Egypt* considered that a tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision. The Committee is of the view that the decision not to address the Facebook Post and other new evidence implies a finding that they were not material to the Tribunal's decision.\n\n150.\n\nThe decision under review here is the conclusion as regards a breach of Article 4 of the BIT.180 The Tribunal considered the Claimants' contentions that the decision to file the Annulment Request was a personal decision of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, adopted as a retaliation for Claimants' refusal to pay the additional sums that she had sought to extract from them,181 and stated that if this were indeed the case, such conduct could constitute a breach of the FET standard enshrined in Article 4 of the BIT.182\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6409.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6396.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6397.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal identified three reasons that, in its view, undermined Claimants' argument:\n\n\u2022 the decision to file the Annulment Request was taken by the democratic organ of the District of Benice, its Assembly, not by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 singlehandedly; there is no evidence that the Assembly was aware of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's unsuccessful efforts to extract funds from the developer and there is no evidence that the Assembly's motives were to retaliate against the investor;\n\n\u2022 the Assembly justified its decision with the arguments which the Tribunal considered to ring true; and\n\n\u2022 the subsequent judgments rendered by the Courts \"retroactively justified\" the District's decision: the Zoning Plan Change was indeed held to be illegal and lacking in proper reasoning, as the District had been claiming.183\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6398.\n\n152.\n\nThis reasoning cannot be said to fall short of the standard imposed by Article 52(1)(e). The reasoning can be followed, and it is not for the Committee to review the decision as if it were an appeal. It is also not the role of an *ad hoc* committee to review the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasoning.\n\n153.\n\nThe Applicants' arguments (lack of indication that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 was authorized to file the Annulment Request, and no sign that the Assembly was aware of her actions and negotiations until June 21, 2012)184 relate to the first building block of the Tribunal's reasoning, namely that the filing of the Annulment Request was not shown to be a personal and retaliatory decision by the mayor against the Claimants. First, as considered above, as a matter of logic, there is no support for the conclusion that \"[n]egotiations held by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 with Mr. Hepner, Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Bernard took place outside any proper administrative procedure and without any authorisation from the Benice District Assembly or of any other administrative body.\"185 Regardless, the first building block of the Tribunal's decision in relation to its conclusion that there was no breach of Article 4 of the BIT is not negated by the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence. Moreover, considering the three reasons contained in paragraph 398 of the Award as set out above, even if there were support for the Applicants' allegation that the decision to file the Annulment Request was motivated by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's desire for personal retaliation, this would have no bearing on the second and third justification identified by the Tribunal.\n\nMem., \u00b6212.\n\nMem., \u00b6221.\n\n154.\n\nIn so far as the Applicants contend that the Tribunal's reasoning was contradictory, the Committee reiterates that committees need to be careful not to stray into an impermissible or substantive assessment of the tribunal's reasoning. A mere or apparent inconsistency is not sufficient; only where the contradiction in reasons is so fundamental that they \"cancel each other out\" may annulment be warranted.186 In this case, the Applicants have not pointed to such inconsistency in the Award. The Applicants have referred to the (potential) inconsistency of some of the evidence (that Applicants alleged to be relevant) with the Tribunal's findings. However, such an assessment is not within the mandate of the Committee under the standards embodied in Article 52(2)(e). Rather, it is the reasoning of the Award and any inconsistency therein that might justify annulment.\n\nSee *Rumeli*, \u00b681, **RLA-17**, *Cube Infrastructure*, \u00b6323, **ALA-26**, *Continental Casualty*, \u00b6103, **RLA-7**.\n\n155.\n\nThe Applicants' second prong of the first annulment ground is that in failing to decide what the motives were behind the Mayor's decision to file the Annulment Request and also Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's decision to join the lawsuit, the Tribunal failed to address a particular question. In support, the Applicants refer to the wording of PO5, by which the Tribunal allowed Claimants to submit the Facebook Post, stating that \"the New Evidence pertains to facts which are prima facie relevant and material to the case, because Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1's testimony could clarify the dispute between the Parties regarding the real motives behind Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's decision to file the lawsuit that eventually resulted in the annulment of the zoning plan change.\"187\n\nPO5, **A-40**.\n\n156.\n\nThis ground is a variation of the previous ground, focusing on the failure specifically to decide on the motives of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 in deciding to file the lawsuit and of Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 in deciding to join the Annulment Request. As with the first ground, this ground fails because it does not take as the starting point the Award and the actual decision of the Tribunal regarding the claim before it but rather a hypothetical scenario developed by the Applicants.\n\n157.\n\nIn issuing its PO5, the Tribunal may well have envisaged the possibility that new evidence would shed light on the motives to file the lawsuit. Be that as it may, and regardless of whether the document admitted into the record (Exhibit C-219) could be seen to shed any light on such motives, in the Tribunal's reasoning \"the real motives\" were not in fact a building block for its decision. It is the prerogative of the tribunal to shape the decision and to determine the relevance if any of evidence submitted for its decision.\n\n158.\n\nFurthermore, as the committee in *Tulip* observed,\n\n*[w]hen a tribunal orders production of a document, it does so on the assumption that it may be relevant to the issue in dispute. Whether it is, the tribunal can only determine after review of the document, in the context of the parties' arguments, that it evaluates its probative value in the exercise of its discretionary power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1). [\u2026] The fact that the Tribunal does not refer to it specifically in its reasoning implies that it did not consider it to be material.*188\n\n*Tulip*, \u00b6150, **ALA-8** (\"[w]hen a tribunal orders production of a document, it does so on the assumption that it may be relevant to the issue in dispute. Whether it is, the tribunal can only determine after review of the document, in the context of the parties' arguments, that it evaluates its probative value in the exercise of its discretionary power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1). [\u2026] The fact that the Tribunal does not refer to it specifically in its reasoning implies that it did not consider it to be material.\"). See Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 60.\n\n159.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal's evaluation of Exhibit C-219 and its potential relevance was subsequent to the Tribunal's procedural decision to admit the exhibit into the record, and the Tribunal was entitled, at its discretion, to omit any express reference to that exhibit or any other document that the Tribunal did not deem to be material. In any event, the Tribunal's conclusion that the Applicants had failed to establish a violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT in connection with the Annulment Request was based on a three-tier decision as set out above, with the second and third tier reasoning not affected by issues of the potential motives at the time of filing of lawsuit.\n\n160.\n\nThe Applicants' third prong of the first annulment ground takes their argument one notch further by arguing that the Tribunal's failure to address the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence, as well as the Claimants' arguments in relation thereto, independently constitutes a breach of the right to be heard under Article 52(1)(d). While this right does not imply the need to address every argument and every piece of evidence, the Applicants submit that the right to be heard imposes the obligation to provide reasons why the tribunal does not consider these arguments and evidence relevant.189\n\nMem., \u00b6246.\n\n161.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal has not departed from the fundamental rule of a right to be heard in not addressing expressly the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence.190 Specifically, as set out above (see para. 57), the Committee is not persuaded by the suggestion that the right to be heard imposes an obligation on a tribunal to provide reasons why it does not consider arguments and evidence relevant, which would essentially amount to circular reasoning eroding the tribunal's right to determine which elements are relevant building blocks for its decision, and conversely, which are not. As noted above, a tribunal must provide reasons for its award, not reasons for its reasons.191\n\nSee supra, \u00b650 (setting out the relevant three-part test for a determination of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure).\n\nSee supra, \u00b657, citing *Enron* \u00b6222.\n\n162.\n\nMore generally, the Committee is of the view that the Applicants have not established that they were denied a \"reasonable and fair\" opportunity to present their case in the Arbitration.192 As set out in relation to the first and second prong of this annulment ground, the Applicants' contentions in relation to the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence and arguments fail on many levels. Even insofar as there is factual support for the allegation that the Tribunal did not make reference thereto, the basis for the decision in favor of (partial) annulment by the committee in *TECO v. Guatemala* (namely that the parties have placed significant emphasis on certain evidence) has not been established by the Applicants in relation to the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence, as the Committee already has concluded above in paragraph 152. Moreover, it is not apparent that the disputed evidence provides support for the conclusions the Applicants seek to derive therefrom (in arguing that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 acted on her own behalf, without any authorization of the Benice District Assembly and without its knowledge193), nor is the alleged inconsistency in the evidence before the Tribunal a basis for a finding of inconsistent *reasons* in the Award of such gravity that they can be said to amount to a failure to provide reasons under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*Von Pezold*, \u00b6255, **RLA-5.**\n\nMem., \u00b6212.\n\n163.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the Applicants have not met their burden to establish the basis for annulment that they have advanced under Articles 52(1)(e) and (d) in connection with the Tribunal's treatment of the \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 evidence.\n\n**B. Ground 2: The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Consider Events Cumulatively in Context to Each Other**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Applicants state that during the written procedure in the Arbitration they alleged that multiple actions of diverse agents and institutions, and especially those of Mayor V\u011bra Topi\u010dov\u00e1, District of Benice, Mayor Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hude\u010dek and the Assembly of the City of Prague, led to violations of the Treaty.194\n\nMem., \u00b6256.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants expressly requested that the Tribunal consider the conduct of all the representatives of the Czech Republic as a whole\u2014as a single action which violated the Treaty.195 They disagree with the Respondent that this request was made for the first time in their Post-Hearing Brief. They explain that even though the phrase \"cumulatively in context to each other\" was formulated for the first time in their Post-Hearing Brief, it was merely \"to concretize and explicate their claims asserted from the very beginning of the underlying arbitration.\"196\n\nMem., \u00b6257.\n\nReply \u00b6214.\n\n166.\n\nThe Applicants further explain that the issue at hand was addressed amply in both the Memorial and the Reply, where the Claimants described \"the crux of the case [as] 'whether Respondent's treatment of Claimants violated international law [...] in light of the following combination of circumstances and actions by local officials.'\"197 The Claimants maintain that the cumulative nature of their claims was also addressed at the hearing.198\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6219-220, citing Reply on the Merits, \u00b6383, **A-6** (emphasis added by the Applicant).\n\nReply, \u00b6221, citing to Merits Hr. Tr., January 26, 2020, 74:12-20, **A-29**.\n\n167.\n\nThe Applicants underscore that the Claimants' position that the concerted efforts outlined above constituted a basis for their claim of breach of the Treaty was set forth in their Post-Hearing Brief, as follows:\n\n*Finally, the Tribunal does not need to decide whether each of Benice's and the City of Prague's individual actions described below was a wrongful act under the BIT. Rather, the events should be considered \"cumulatively in context to each other\". Ultimately the question is whether the cumulative effect of Respondents' actions on the Claimants' investments amounts to a violation of the BIT.*199\n\nMem., \u00b6262, quoting Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b621, **A-7**.\n\n168.\n\nThe Applicants further contend that they specified the conduct that gave rise to the alleged breach in the Arbitration:\n\n*- Benice and Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves actively pursued rezoning of the Project Area to residential starting in 2002.*\n\n*- The districts then enticed Claimants into purchasing property for the purpose of developing a residential complex in 2007 and into making further investments to develop the project over the next five years.*\n\n*- Messrs. Langmajer, Coller, Votava, and others explicitly assured Mr. Pawlowski that the project will be realized.*\n\n*- Both districts and the City of Prague approved the anticipated zoning plan change in 2010, thereby changing the functional use of the Project Area to residential.*\n\n*- The State then increased the density of the development allowed in the Project Area in 2011.*\n\n*- And then in 2012 the State deliberately and without warning, contradicted its prior behavior when Benice, the district that had initially applied for the zoning change in 2004 and which had approved the density increase in 2011, filed a lawsuit seeking to annul the zoning plan change that had already become effective in 2010,*\n\n*- After the courts annulled the zoning change for lack of sufficient substantiation in the Prague City Assembly's 2010 approval of the change, the City of Prague failed to remedy the situation and protect the Claimants' investment by:*\n\no *refusing for 26 months to even consider taking the minimal steps required to restore the zoning in the Project Area to residential, and finally*\n\no *deciding definitively in April 2015 not to restore the zoning in the Project Area to residential.*200\n\nMem., \u00b6260, quoting Claimants' Reply on the Merits, \u00b6383, **A-6**.\n\n169.\n\nCiting *Stati v. Kazakhstan* and *Rompetrol v. Romania*, the Claimants maintain that it is standard practice in investment arbitration that respondent's actions be considered \"cumulatively in context to each other.\"\n\n170.\n\nIn *Rompetrol v. Romania*, the Tribunal stated,\n\n*[It] can join other recent tribunals in accepting that the cumulative effect of a succession of impugned actions by the State of the investment can together amount to a failure to accord fair and equitable treatment even where the individual actions, taken on their own, would not surmount the threshold for a Treaty breach.*201\n\nMem., \u00b6264, quoting *Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, May 6, 2013, \u00b6276, **ALA-21**.\n\n171.\n\nParadoxically, the Applicants say, the Tribunal itself acknowledged in the Award that:\n\n*Claimants argue that the Tribunal does not need to decide whether each of Benice's and the City of Prague's individual actions was wrongful; the events should be considered \"cumulatively in context to each other,\" with the ultimate question being whether the cumulative effect of Respondent's actions amounts to a violation of the BIT.*202\n\nMem., \u00b6265, quoting *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6276, **A-1**.\n\n172.\n\nThe Applicants observe, however, that the Tribunal did not consider the actions of the Czech Republic's representatives cumulatively. Instead, they dealt with each one in isolation, without explanation as to why they did not adopt a cumulative approach.203\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6266-267.\n\n173.\n\nFor the Applicants, the Tribunal's failure to analyze the acts of the Czech Republic's representatives cumulatively was outcome-determinative. For example, the Tribunal decided that the conduct of the mayor acting on behalf of the borough\u2014demanding payments in return for withdrawal of the lawsuit against Projekt Sever and a guarantee of the borough's \"smooth cooperation in the permitting stages\" or renovation of \"civil amenities\"\u2014resulted in a violation of the BIT.204\n\nMem., \u00b6270, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6354-359, **A-1.**\n\n174.\n\nNonetheless, the Applicants observe that, the Tribunal's opinion that the borough's decision to file the Annulment Request, the mayor's decision regarding re-procurement, the City Assembly's decision not to re-procure and Benice's opposition to the re-procurement did *not* result in violation of the BIT.205\n\nMem., \u00b6271, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6374-409, **A-1.**\n\n175.\n\nThe Applicants explain that the actions by the borough are connected: if the investor had paid the sums wrongfully demanded by the mayor, the borough would have ensured the smooth running of his Project. There would have, therefore, been no Annulment Request and the borough would have indicated its consent to the planning and building authorization procedures. Similarly, the deputy mayor would not have disavowed the Zoning Plan Change at a Prague City Assembly meeting on April 14, 2015.\n\n176.\n\nTaking a cumulative approach, the Applicants argue that the Tribunal would have concluded that the adverse concerted actions of the city and its officials resulted from Mr. Pawlowski's refusal to pay the requested bribe. These actions, the Applicants submit, also breached Article 4 of the Treaty. However, according to the Applicants, the failure to undertake a cumulative analysis precluded an award of damages, given that the Claimants had connected the quantification of damages to the filing of the Annulment Request (which, as noted, the Tribunal determined was not a violation of the BIT).206\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6272-280.\n\n177.\n\nThe Applicants claim that the Tribunal's failure to consider events cumulatively in context to each other amounts to a failure to address a particular question pursuant to Article 52(1)(e). The Applicants deny that these arguments constitute an effort to obtain appellate review of the Tribunal's findings. Instead, the Applicants say that this ground for annulment is rooted in the Tribunal's having omitted from its reasons points addressing the Claimants' claim directed at the conduct of all the representatives of the Czech Republic as a whole.207\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6205, 209.\n\n178.\n\nFor the Applicants, there is no doubt that the question of whether the cumulative conduct breached the BIT was \"adequately submitted to the Tribunal\" in accordance with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i)\u2014provisions that require the Tribunal to deal with each question submitted to it.208\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6281-283.\n\n179.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the Tribunal did not, however, consider the Respondent's actions cumulatively, but in fact did the opposite, and therefore the Tribunal failed to state reasons pursuant to Article 52(1)(e).209\n\nMem., \u00b6286, citing *Duke*, \u00b6228, **ALA-14**; *EDF*, \u00b6\u00b6197-198, **ALA-15**.\n\n180.\n\nThe Applicants also claim that the Tribunal's failure to consider the Respondent's acts cumulatively violated their right to be heard and warrants annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(d), given that under the Applicants' interpretation this provision obliged the Tribunal to \"answer every argument and address every piece of evidence or provide reasons why it does not consider\" them to be relevant.210\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6289-295; Reply \u00b6\u00b6242-247. But see supra \u00b645; Mem., \u00b6249 (invoking judgments of the ECHR and stating the tribunal \"is not required to provide a detailed answer to every argument and address every piece of evidence but is, on the other hand, required at least to provide reasons why it does not consider the[m to be] relevant.\").\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Applicants' complaints that the Tribunal allegedly failed to consider events cumulatively fall short of the standards for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) and (e).\n\n182.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal summarized Claimants' argument and addressed all Claimants' claims.211 The Respondent disagrees that the \"Claimants repeatedly asked the Tribunal to consider multiple actions of Czech local officials cumulatively.\"212 Instead, the Respondent observes that the Claimants requested that the Tribunal consider \"Benice's and the City of Prague's individual actions [] 'cumulatively and in context to one another'\" for the first and only time in their Post-Hearing Brief, as an alternative argument.213\n\nHr. Tr. 89:14-17.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6123.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6124.\n\n183.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants had expressly noted otherwise when they stated in their Reply that \"[w]hile an accumulation of independently innocuous measures may add up to a violation of FET, Claimants do not rely on such a 'creeping violation.'\"214\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6125, citing Claimants' Reply on the Merits, July 3, 2019, \u00b6403, **A-6** (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Tribunal cannot be faulted for not explicitly addressing an alternative argument that arises for the first time in a Post-Hearing Brief. The Respondent relies on *Cortec v. Kenya* in which the committee concluded that,\n\n*[T]he Tribunal could not be faulted for not expressly addressing such a potential claim, buried as it was in a footnote to the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief. If the Claimants wished to pursue such a claim, it was incumbent on them to set out their position clearly at an earlier stage of the proceedings \u2013 or at least to raise it to the Tribunal's attention in a post-Award application.*215\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6126, citing *Cortec, \u00b6*173*,* **RLA-30.**\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the Claimants' allegations amount to nothing more than a line of argument, and there was no \"claim\" made by the Claimants for a ruling by the Tribunal regarding the cumulation of their allegations against the Respondent.216 The Respondent rejects the Applicants' contention that the \"claim\" was made in each of the Claimants' pleadings and also at the hearing. It was, at best, never clearly presented, like the cryptic claim in *Cortec v. Kenya*.217\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6132-134; Hr. Tr. 89:14-17.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6139-144.\n\n186.\n\nBut even if it were a claim, the Respondent submits that even a failure to address a claim does not give rise to an annulment provided that the Claimants were given the opportunity to present their position in the Arbitration.218 Additionally, annulment is not the post-award remedy to be used where there has been the sort of omission alleged by the Applicants. Instead, they should have requested that the Tribunal issue a supplementary decision under ICSID Rule 49.219\n\nRej., \u00b6137.\n\nRej., \u00b6136, citing *Duke*, \u00b6228, **ALA-14**. See also Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 71; Hr. Tr. 89:18-23.\n\n187.\n\nEven so, the Respondent says that when considering the Award as a whole, as the relevant test requires,220 the Tribunal did in fact consider the alleged acts cumulatively, even noting the Claimants' argument in the Award at paragraph 276. Moreover, it made express findings as follows:\n\n\u2022 that it was \"not persuaded by [Claimants'] argument\" that the Benice's District Assembly's decision to file the Annulment Request was a retaliatory act connected with any \"efforts to extract funds from the developer.\"221\n\n\u2022 The mayor's stance opposing re-procurement \"had no influence on the Assembly's eventual decision to dismiss the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change.\"222\n\n\u2022 The deputy mayor did not manipulate the Prague City Assembly into voting against the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change.223\n\n\u2022 There was \"no evidence that Benice's opposition to the re-procurement swayed the (unanimous) decision of the City Assembly.\"224\n\nRej., \u00b6150, n. 258\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6130, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6394, 398, **A-1**; Reply, \u00b6150.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6131, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6463, **A-1**; Reply, \u00b6150.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6131, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6489-501, **A-1**; Reply, \u00b6150.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6131, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6506, **A-1**.\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to say that the Applicants have not shown that the Tribunal's alleged failure in this regard concerns a serious or outcome-determinative point. In particular, the Respondent observes that the Applicants contend\u2014without elaboration\u2014 that they would have been awarded damages had the Tribunal considered the Respondent's actions cumulatively. But the Tribunal did just that, according to the Respondent, and considered that this alternative argument was irrelevant to its conclusions.225\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6133-135; Reply, \u00b6154.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nIn analyzing the Applicants' arguments for annulment based on the Tribunal's alleged failure to consider the impugned events cumulatively, the Committee begins with the observation that the Tribunal took cognizance of the Claimants' argument in paragraph 276 of its Award. Namely, the Tribunal recorded \"that [it] does not need to decide whether each of Benice's and the City of Prague's individual actions was wrongful; the events should be considered 'cumulatively in context to each other,' with the ultimate question being whether the cumulative effect of the Respondent's actions amounts to a violation of the BIT.\"226\n\nMem., \u00b6265, quoting *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6276, **A-1**.\n\n190.\n\nIn structuring its decision, the Tribunal first set out in Chapter III of the Award the facts in largely chronological order, followed by the relevant legal standard, recording that the \"Claimants single[d] out the following measures\" for which they allege State responsibility under international law on the basis that the measures were not only unreasonable but also arbitrary:\n\n\u2022 Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's attempts to extract payment from Claimants;\n\n\u2022 Benice's filing of the Annulment Request, by which it sought to annul the Zoning Plan Change;\n\n\u2022 Benice's opposition to the re-procurement of the Zoning Plan Change;\n\n\u2022 Mayor Hude\u010dek's refusal to re-procure the Zoning Plan Change; and\n\n\u2022 The City Assembly's decision to terminate the procurement.227\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6350, **A-1**.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal succinctly paraphrased the Respondent's high-level disagreement, namely that\n\n\u2022 Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 never tried to extort money from the Claimants and that Benice's actions were within its prerogatives and neither unreasonable nor unjustifiable;\n\n\u2022 As regards the actions of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and Deputy Mayor Stropnick\u00fd, the Respondents aver that neither the Mayor, nor the Deputy Mayor acted arbitrarily;\n\n\u2022 With respect to the actions of the Prague City Assembly, the Respondent argues that these actions cannot be construed as arbitrary or unjustifiable, since in all instances the Assembly acted in full compliance with Czech law, demonstrating no abuse of administrative discretion.228\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6351, **A-1**.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal analyzed the impugned measures chronologically, which led it to conclude that the Czech Republic had breached Article 4 of the BIT based on Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's attempts to extract payment from Claimants (in 2009 and in 2011).229 To this effect, the Tribunal considered that the Mayor of Benice represented an organ of the Czech Republic, and in accordance with Article 4 of the ILC Articles the Mayor's conduct must be attributed to the Czech Republic.230\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6362, **A-1**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6373, **A-1**.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to address sequentially the other measures which had been \"singled out\" by the Claimants (the subsequent filing of the Annulment request by Benice (Section 3.2), Mayor Hude\u010dek's opposition to re-procurement (Section 3.3), the Assembly's decision not to re-procure (Section 3.4), and Benice's opposition to the re-procurement (Section 3.5)).\n\n194.\n\nThe question before the Committee is whether in structuring its decision in this way, the Tribunal failed to address a particular question under the standards of Article 52(1)(e) or violated Claimants' right to be heard under Article 52(1)(d). The Committee addresses each ground for annulment in turn.\n\n195.\n\nAs regards the Applicants' invocation of Article 52(1)(e), the Committee observes that, on the face of the Award, the Tribunal was cognizant of the fact that the Claimants had argued (albeit explicitly for the first time only in their Post-Hearing Brief) that each of Benice's and the City of Prague's individual actions or measures should be considered cumulatively as well as individually. Obviously, the Tribunal's approach still required a review of each alleged breach, including whether the conduct of the relevant actor or actors could be attributed to the State.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants refer to their Memorial on the Merits in support of their contention that the breaches of the BIT were based not on single actions \"but [as] a whole.\"231 The difficulty with this statement is that while Chapter VI is entitled \"the Czech Republic has violated the BIT,\" in the factual basis for each alleged breach, the Claimants presented their claims as a set of distinct actions, committed by different local officials. While the Applicants describe their position as having requested that the Tribunal consider actions \"cumulatively *in context to each other*,\" in their submissions Claimants describe a large number of actions and circumstances sequentially, without, however, addressing the potential context or interrelationship. For example, in paragraphs 284-285 of the Memorial on the Merits, the Applicants (then Claimants) presented not so much the context of each fact and the potential relation to other but rather a compilation of overlapping statements.\n\nReply, \u00b6219, citing Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6245 - 322, **A-5**.\n\n197.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Claimants' invocation of the cumulative events is properly characterized as an argument rather than an independent claim. Furthermore, had it been intended as an independent claim, which the Tribunal failed to address, the suitable remedy would have been recourse to the Tribunal for a supplementary decision under ICSID Rule 49.\n\n198.\n\nMoreover, in contrast to the Applicants' emphasis in the Annulment Proceedings, the Claimants' presentation of their arguments in the Arbitration focused in fact on the individual alleged breaches, not the possible interrelationship and/or the collective or cumulative conduct. For example, the submissions in Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, address specifically the borough of Benice's alleged arbitrary conduct consisting of Benice's failure to refrain from filing a lawsuit to annul the Zoning Plan Change, after having supported the zoning change earlier.232 There is no suggestion in this argument that Benice's conduct should be seen in the context and in conjunction with other acts and/or the conduct of other actors. Thus, it is not clear that Claimants advanced a cumulative claim in the Arbitration, in the manner suggested by the Applicants' submissions on annulment. Regardless of its specific contours, having acknowledged the Claimants' cumulative claim argument,233 and having rejected each individual claim, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal implicitly rejected the cumulative claim too.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b668-72, **A-7.**\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6276.\n\n199.\n\nIt is not the role of an *ad hoc* committee to review the correctness or fulsomeness of a reasoning or to impose particular mode of expression on a tribunal; in particular, the tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision (see above para. 75).\n\n200.\n\nFaced with the elaborate but arguably somewhat indiscriminate compilation of allegations, the Tribunal chose to digest the claims by means of a largely chronological analysis. This resulted in a finding of a breach in relation to the impugned payments, but not the other components of the allegedly unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\n\n201.\n\nThus, in summary, the Committee concurs with the considerations expressed by the committee in *Rumeli*, that if the arguments of the parties have been correctly summarized and all *claims* have been addressed, the tribunal has discretion in selecting which *arguments* to address.234 Second, the Committee agrees with the Respondent that insofar as the Tribunal could be said to have failed to address a question, the logical and appropriate remedy is a request for a supplementary decision. Without more, a failure to address every question will not in and of itself justify annulment.235\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 69, citing *Rumeli*, \u00b684, **RLA-17**.\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 71, citing *Duke*, \u00b6228, **ALA-14**.\n\n202.\n\nIn this case, the Committee is not persuaded by the Applicants' contention that \"there is more.\" In light of the way in which Claimants structured their arguments in the Arbitration, the Tribunal cannot be faulted for structuring its decision in the way it did, and focusing its decision on what it perceived the critical elements of the claims and arguments.\n\n203.\n\nIn any event, the Committee did, in effect, consider the impact of any potential ulterior and/or impermissible motive for the decision to proceed with the Annulment Request. In paragraph 398 of the Award, the Tribunal sets out its three-tier reasoning in support of its conclusion that the filing did not constitute a breach of the FET standard contained in Article 4 of the BIT, notwithstanding the Claimants' contention that the decision to file the Annulment Request was an arbitrary act as a personal decision of the Mayor adopted as retaliation:\n\n\u2022 the decision to file the Annulment Request was taken by the democratic organ of the District of Benice, its Assembly, and there is no evidence that the Assembly's motives were retaliation or that it was even aware of the Mayor's unsuccessful efforts to extract payment;\n\n\u2022 second, the Assembly justified its decision with a reasoning that the Tribunal considered to ring true; and\n\n\u2022 third, the subsequent judgments rendered by the Courts retroactively justified the District's decision.\n\n204.\n\nConsequently, even if the Committee had determined that the Tribunal's decision reflected a failure to address a claim or outcome-determinative argument, which the Committee has not, the considerations in paragraph 398 serve as belt and braces support for the Tribunal's decision. In these circumstances, the Committee declines to accept the Applicants' position that the Tribunal's reasoning fails to meet the standard of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n205.\n\nFinally, the Committee also cannot accept the Applicants' submission that the Tribunal's failure to consider events cumulatively in context with each other amounts to violation of Claimants' right to be heard under Article 52(1)(d). As considered above, tribunals are not required explicitly to mention every argument or piece of evidence.236 Furthermore, the requirement to deal with all claims and/or defenses specifically raised for the tribunal's determination does not implicate a fundamental rule of procedure requiring a tribunal to give express consideration to every argument or issue advanced by a party in relation to a particular question.237 Additionally, while it is conceivable that a failure to provide reasons coincides with a violation of a party's right to be heard, they are distinct annulment grounds and a failure to provide reasons as such\u2014which the Committee has concluded has not been established as regards the Tribunal's alleged failure to consider events cumulatively\u2014is not in any event sufficient to constitute a breach of the right to be heard.\n\n*Von Pezold*, \u00b6255, **RLA-5**.\n\n*Continental Casualty*, \u00b692, **RLA-7**.\n\n206.\n\nIn this case, for the reasons given above, the Committee has found that that there has been no failure to provide reasons as required pursuant to Article 52(1)(e). For similar reasons, the Committee rejects the argument that either as a corollary thereof and/or independently, the Tribunal's decision constitutes a breach of the right to be heard.\n\n207.\n\nInsofar as Claimants argued that the impugned actions cumulatively and in context with each other constituted a violation, and that the Tribunal failed to consider the totality of and the correlation between the actions, the Applicants have not demonstrated a failure of the Tribunal to do justice to the arguments made. The Tribunal recorded the Claimants' argument concerning the need to consider the cumulative effect of the Respondent's actions.238 However, the Claimants did not identify a particular connection between these actions and the focus in the Arbitration appears to have been the (multitude of) individual actions. As noted in paragraph 198 above, in the context of the award as a whole, the Tribunal's rejection of each individual claim is tantamount to a rejection of any argument that the Respondent's actions taken cumulatively amounted to a violation of the BIT.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6276, **A-1**.\n\n208.\n\nFurthermore, it was the Tribunal's prerogative to determine which arguments and/or evidence are relevant building blocks, so that even if the Tribunal could be said not to have addressed every argument, which in any event the Committee has rejected, that would not have constituted a breach of the right to be heard.\n\n209.\n\nGiven that the Committee has rejected the argument that the Tribunal committed a breach of the right to be heard, the magnitude and severity of such breach is a moot point. In any event, as before, the Committee refers to the Tribunal's considerations in paragraph 398 of the Award, which establish that regardless of any defects in other parts of the Tribunal's decision in relation to the alleged breach of the FET standard, if any, the Tribunal explicitly determined that the Claimants' arguments cannot be sustained.\n\n**C. Ground 3: The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Consider Events Cumulatively in Context to Each Other with Respect to Damages and Compensation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nAs the Claimants stated in connection with their ground for annulment addressed in Section IV.B above, the Czech Republic violated the Treaty based on its conduct as a whole. The Applicants maintain that their claim for compensation was based on the same principle, but the Tribunal failed to take this fact into account, in violation of the standards laid down in Articles 52(1)(d) and (e).239\n\nMem., \u00b6297.\n\n211.\n\nMore specifically, the Applicants state that in the Arbitration they argued that \"[t]he annulment of the change in the zoning plan in 2013 such that the real property could no longer be developed for residential use, and the City of Prague's decision in 2015 not to pursue procurement of the change annulled by the courts, prevented construction of the Project and severely damaged Claimants.\"240\n\nMem., \u00b6299, citing Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6334, **A-5**.\n\n212.\n\nThe Applicants go on to assert that these statements corresponded to an analysis done by its economic expert from AlixPartners, who stated in his report that,\n\n*For the case at hand, it is my understanding that Respondent's interference(s) occurred over a longer period of time. Despite these creeping interference(s), I have been instructed to use 14 April 2015 as the best proxy for the date when the Claimants' investments were fatally damaged or indirectly expropriated, as this \"Date of Harm\" represents the date when the progress of the Housing Complex would have continued \"but-for\" the ultimate damaging event, i.e. the Prague City Assembly's decision not to remedy the deficiencies identified by the court and restore the residential zoning designation.*241\n\nMem., \u00b6300, citing Quantum Report for the Determination of Damages of Kai F. Schumacher, AlixPartners GmbH, June 26, 2018, \u00b677, **A-42**.\n\n213.\n\nAnd in the Reply on the Merits, the Claimants stated that they again sought damages \"as a result of their inability to realize the development of [the] Benice Residential Complex.\"242\n\nMem., \u00b6301, citing the Reply on the Merits \u00b6575.\n\n214.\n\nThe Applicants maintain that even the Respondent admitted in this annulment proceeding that the Claimants' claim for compensation was a \"global claim\" that \"conflate[d] all purported breaches with all purported damages.\"243\n\nReply, \u00b6253, citing C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6142-143.\n\n215.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, the Tribunal nevertheless failed to acknowledge in the Award that the Claimants had requested that the State's individual actions be considered as a single concerted action in assessing damages.244\n\nMem., \u00b6302.\n\n216.\n\nInstead, the Tribunal considered the claim for damages based to the conduct that it judged to be a violation of the BIT, i.e., that of the mayor. The Tribunal then concluded that there was no causal link between the conduct that was deemed internationally wrongful and the damages claimed by the Claimants. The Tribunal did not provide a reason why it did not assess the actions of the various State actors cumulatively in connection with the assessment of damages, nor explain why they could not be so considered.245\n\nMem., \u00b6303; Reply, \u00b6255.\n\n217.\n\nAs already had been shown, according to the view of the Applicants, the actions by the State representatives were interconnected. \"Had Mr. Pawlowski paid the amount wrongfully demanded by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1, most likely there would have been no Annulment Request and neither [the] City of Prague nor Benice would have opposed the re-procurement.\"246 Thus, the Tribunal should have considered these actions cumulatively, and if the Tribunal had done so it would have awarded damages to the Claimants.247\n\nMem., \u00b6308.\n\nMem., \u00b6309.\n\n218.\n\nAs with the prior, related ground, the Applicants again observe that because the Tribunal did not consider the Respondent's actions cumulatively, and in fact did the opposite, the Tribunal failed to state reasons pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) on this potentially outcome-determinative issue.248\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6311-315; Reply, \u00b6260.\n\n219.\n\nThe Applicants again also argue that the Tribunal's failure to consider the Respondent's acts cumulatively with regard to damages violated their right to be heard, thus warranting annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(d), on the basis that the Tribunal \"did not provide any reason why it did not \u2026 assess the actions of the representatives of the Czech Republic cumulatively with respect to Claimant's [*sic*] damages claim.\"249\n\nMem., \u00b6316-321.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Respondent urges the Committee to dismiss this ground for reasons similar to those advanced against the Applicants' Ground 2\u2014as the two grounds are essentially identical. The Respondent asserts that the Tribunal did consider the Claimants' belated alternative argument and rejected it.250\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6141; Rej., \u00b6157.\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to say that the Claimants' claim for damages was fundamentally flawed, as it was not linked to any particular behavior of the Czech Republic. The Claimants were instead pursuing an impermissible global claim.251 In its Counter-Memorial in the Arbitration, the Respondent observed that the \"Claimants have not specified which heads of damage correspond to which specific Treaty violations. Rather, Claimants conflate all purported breaches with all purported damages.\"252 The Respondent says that the Claimants never refuted this, and the Tribunal rightly dismissed the Claimants' approach stating that \"[t]he duty to make reparation extends only to those damages which [] are legally regarded as the consequence of the wrongful act.\"253 The Tribunal went on to find that \"Claimants have failed to prove that the wrongful acts of the Czech Republic caused any damage at all.\"254\n\nRej., \u00b6160.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6142, citing Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, December 5, 2018, \u00b6402, **A-8**.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6144, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6728, **A-1**; Rej., \u00b6162.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6144, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6731-733, **A-1**; Rej., \u00b6163.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nSimilar to the ground addressed under Section IV.D below, this ground for annulment is a variation on the broad second ground for annulment addressed under Section IV.B. Unlike the ground addressed at Section IV.D, however, which essentially addresses a subset of the factual circumstances considered by the Tribunal, this ground goes to the Tribunal's decision in relation to damages, and its explicit finding that one of the two elements that it considered prerequisites for the damages calculation, had not been fulfilled.\n\n223.\n\nThe Applicants argue that their claim for damages is based on their inability to realize the development of Residential Complex Benice,255 which was caused by the complex set of actions of the State via its officials.256 They submit that the Tribunal never acknowledged that \"Claimants' damages claim was put before it in this matter but rather held that Claimants' quantification related mostly to the filing of the Annulment Request by the District of Benice and the following decision of Prague City Assembly, not [to] reprocure a zoning change.\"257 In their written submissions on annulment, the Applicants phrased their argument slightly differently, namely that the Tribunal considered the damage incurred by the Claimants based solely on the conduct it judged to be a violation of the BIT but not in connection with other conduct.\n\nClaimants' Reply on Merits, \u00b6575, **A-6**.\n\nHr. Tr. 33:23-25.\n\nHr. Tr. 34:1-8.\n\n224.\n\nFor the reasons set out above in Section IV.B(3), the Committee already rejected the argument that the Tribunal failed to consider events cumulatively in context with each other. Given that this ground builds on the allegation that the Tribunal's decision is defective in this sense, there is no basis to sustain the similar derivative argument pertaining specifically to damages.\n\n225.\n\nMoreover, there is no logical support for the Applicants' argument. The Tribunal considered that the claim for damages was based on the premise that the Annulment Decision adopted by the Czech Courts, as well as the subsequent decision by the Prague City Assembly to terminate the re-procurement of the Zoning Change, destroyed the value of Claimants' investment. The Tribunal found that there was no evidence that the filing by the District of Benice of the Annulment Request, and the subsequent adoption of the Annulment Decision by the Czech Courts, which annulled the Zoning Plan Change (as well as the decision by the Prague City Assembly not to re-procure the annulled Zoning Plan Change) constitute internationally wrongful acts attributable to the Czech Republic.\n\n226.\n\nThus, the damages finding sought by the Claimants was precluded not by the Tribunal's alleged failure to consider events cumulatively, but the Tribunal's determination that Claimants failed to show evidence of a causal link between the internationally wrongful conduct attributable to the Respondent and the damages claimed. Contrary to the Applicants' arguments (in particular on annulment), the Tribunal identified an absence of evidence for what it considered a determinative step in Claimants' damages calculation. The evaluation of evidence is firmly within the Tribunal's remit. In any event, the Committee has found that insofar as the reliance on the cumulative effect of events constituted a claim, rather than an argument, a proper reading of the award as a whole and in context makes clear that the Tribunal implicitly rejected such claim. Thus, there is no basis for the allegation that the cumulative consideration of the various actions would have countermanded the Tribunal's conclusions as to the established internationally wrongful acts and the damages claimed.\n\n227.\n\nIn sum, there is no factual or logical basis for this annulment ground and, in any event, given that this ground builds on an annulment ground which the Committee has found does not meet the standards of either Article 52(1)(d) or (e), this ground also must be rejected.\n\n**D. Ground 4: The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Consider Actions of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and the District of Benice Cumulatively in Context to Each Other**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nSimilar to the second ground for Annulment addressed above in Section IV.B that the Tribunal failed to consider that Respondent violated the Treaty based on its conduct as a whole, the Applicants' fourth ground posits that, in the Arbitration, the Claimants had maintained that the actions of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and the District of Benice had to be considered together and cumulatively in their context, but the Tribunal failed to do so.258\n\nMem., \u00b6322; Reply, \u00b6272.\n\n229.\n\nDuring the written procedure in the Arbitration, the Claimants alleged that Benice's decision to challenge the Zoning Plan Change, which put a stop to the Benice Residential Complex, was not rational. Instead, for the Claimants, it was an act of revenge against Projekt Sever for not agreeing to make the payments that the mayor demanded.259\n\nMem., \u00b6323, citing Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6139, **A-5**.\n\n230.\n\nDuring the written procedure, the Respondent produced witness statements of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 in which she \"did not deny\" that she sought payments from Mr. Pawlowski but asserted that \"[t]he lawsuit was not brought to extort money from Mr. Pawlowski or for 'revenge.'\"260\n\nMem., \u00b6325, citing Second Witness Statement of V\u011bra Topi\u010dov\u00e1, November 6, 2019, \u00b630, **A-42**.\n\n231.\n\nBut at the hearing, the Applicants say, the mayor refused to answer whether the District of Benice and she would have challenged the Zoning Plan Change had Mr. Pawlowski paid the CZK 30 million demanded by her in 2009.261\n\nMem., \u00b6326.\n\n232.\n\nDespite the Tribunal's acknowledgement in the Arbitration that it had been requested to consider these acts cumulatively, the Applicants contend that the Tribunal did not do so and provided no explanation.262\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6329-332; Reply, \u00b6270.\n\n233.\n\nAgain, the Applicants maintain that \"if the Tribunal assessed all actions of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and the District of Benice cumulatively and in context to each other, its decision on the merits could have been different and the Tribunal would have found a violation of Article 4 of the BIT.\"263 According to the Applicants, the Tribunal's failure to do so gave rise to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) on a potentially outcome-determinative issue.264\n\nMem., \u00b6335.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6336-340; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6277-279.\n\n234.\n\nThe Applicants further contend that the Tribunal's failure to consider cumulatively these acts of Respondent violated the Applicants' right to be heard. On this basis, the Applicants seek annulment also pursuant to Article 52(1)(d), arguing that under this provision the Tribunal was obliged to consider every question and all evidence or provide reasons why it does not consider these matters to be relevant.265\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6341-347; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6282-285.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nFor the Respondent, this ground for annulment cannot be considered separately from the second ground\u2014that events should have been considered cumulatively in context to each other. And in any event, as stated above, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal did indeed consider the actions of the various Czech State organs and actors\u2014including those of the mayor and the District of Benice\u2014cumulatively and in context to each other.266\n\nRej., \u00b6168.\n\n236.\n\nSecond, the Respondent observes that, in any event, to satisfy the standard under Article 52(1)(e) the Tribunal was not required to address every single argument put forth by the parties, but only the outcome-determinative questions. Similarly, the failure of the Tribunal to engage with a piece of evidence is not a \"failure to address a particular question\" pursuant to Article 52(1)(e). Furthermore, the Respondent highlights that the Tribunal found that \"there is no evidence that the Assembly was aware of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's unsuccessful efforts to extract funds from the developer and there is no evidence that the Assembly's motives were to retaliate against the investor.\"267 For the Respondent, this indicates that the Tribunal did consider the Mayor's and the District's actions cumulatively and in context with one another.268\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6171-172.\n\nRej. \u00b6172.\n\n237.\n\nThird, the Respondent disagrees that this is an outcome-determinative issue. Even if the Mayor had stated she would not have challenged the Zoning Plan Change, such a challenge could have been brought by private actors. Indeed, it was, given that Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Hepner joined the challenge.269\n\nRej., \u00b6173.\n\n238.\n\nWhat is more, says the Respondent, is that the Zoning Plan Change plainly warranted annulment\u2014as the Tribunal expressly held. It found that the Benice District acted within its rights, the decision to file the annulment request was justified given the size and nature of the Project, and subsequent court judgments ratified the District's annulment decision.270\n\nRej., \u00b6175.\n\n239.\n\nNor can there be any basis for a failure to be heard under Article 52(1)(d) according to the Respondent. The Parties had an equal opportunity to present their respective cases, and this is not disputed. The Tribunal need not address all evidence before it for a party to have been heard.271\n\nRej., \u00b6176.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThis annulment ground is essentially a derivative or a sub-argument of the broader ground addressed above that the Tribunal failed to consider events cumulatively in context with each other generally. Again invoking both Article 52(1)(e) and (d), the Applicants' focus in advancing this ground is the relationship between the actions of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 and the District of Benice. For reasons similar to those considered in relation to the second ground for annulment, the Committee rejects this ground.\n\n241.\n\nFirst, as a preliminary consideration, the Committee notes that there is some tension in the Applicants' alleging that on the one hand all facts need to be reviewed collectively, and the failure on the part of the Tribunal to do so warrants annulment, and at the same time, a specific inconsistency which is part of a larger group of facts and circumstances, in and of itself constitutes an impermissible inconsistency.\n\n242.\n\nSecond, there is no support for the Applicants' suggestion that the Tribunal would have come to the conclusion that the Annulment Request and Benice's opposition to the Project were the result of Mr. Pawlowski's refusal to make the demanded payment, regardless of whether the Tribunal assessed the actions of the Mayor and the District cumulatively, or otherwise. Namely, as noted earlier, the Tribunal considered it immaterial what the motives or the intended use of any funds paid or sought to be procured were.272 Consequently, even if the motives of Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 were attributed to the District or otherwise considered relevant, the Applicants have not established that would have influenced the Tribunal's conclusion meaningfully.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6372, **A-1**.\n\n243.\n\nFurthermore, as addressed above, it was the Tribunal's prerogative to identify and focus on what it perceived to be the critical elements of the claims and arguments. Moreover, the Committee did in effect consider the impact of any potential ulterior and/or impermissible motive for the decision to file annulment proceedings of the zoning plan (paragraph 398 of the Award) and thus, even if the Tribunal's decision could be considered to reflect a failure to address a claim or outcome determinative argument, which the Committee has not found, these considerations discredit the argument that the Tribunal's reasoning fails to meet the standard of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n244.\n\nSimilarly, considering specifically the subset of actions addressed under the Applicants' fourth ground, for the same reasons expressed in paragraphs 205 to 209 as regards the Applicants' second ground, the Applicants have failed to demonstrate that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under the standards of Article 52(1)(d).\n\n**E. Ground 5: The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Address Claimants' Argument that a BIT Violation Is Not Excused by Compliance with a State's Internal Laws**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Applicants maintain that, in the Arbitration, the Claimants argued extensively that the Respondent cannot defend the behavior of its actors in the face of an alleged treaty violation by arguing that they complied with Czech law. In support of the Applicants' view that these arguments were advanced in the Arbitration, they point to citations in their Memorial, Reply and Post-Hearing Brief, in the original proceeding.273\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6348-350; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6294-296.\n\n246.\n\nThe Applicants also state that, in the Arbitration, the Parties agreed on this point, with the Respondent having also admitted that it is a \"principle of international law that a violation of an international treaty obligation is independent of the laws of the host state or of the treatment of investors under those laws.\"274\n\nMem., \u00b6351, citing Claimants' Reply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6381-382, **A-6**; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6246-251, **A-8**.\n\n247.\n\nAgain, the Applicants further argue that the Tribunal acknowledged the Claimants' argument but paid no further attention to it in its Award, or explain its reasons for not doing so, instead basing its Award on principles that go \"directly against\" Claimants' argument.275\n\nMem., \u00b6353.\n\n248.\n\nIn rejecting the claim of a violation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty for Benice's filing of the Annulment Request, the Tribunal concluded that Benice (and the two private actors who sued) had the right under domestic law to request a review of the Prague City Assembly decision approving the Zoning Plan Change. Relying on the maxim, \"*Qui iure suo utitur neminem laedit*,\" meaning \"He who uses a right injures no one,\" the Tribunal concluded the decision by the District to file the Annulment Request did not amount to a violation of the Treaty.276\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6352-356.\n\n249.\n\nThe Applicants assert that, in reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal did not examine the Claimants' argument regarding domestic law, nor did it explain why it was disregarded.277 The Tribunal acknowledged the Claimants' argument only formally, in the introductory part of the merits section, which the Applicants submit is not sufficient.\n\nMem., \u00b6357; Reply \u00b6304.\n\n250.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, the Tribunal's failure to address Claimants' argument could have had a decisive effect on the outcome of the Award. The Applicants insist that Benice's decision to file the Annulment Request was \"out of all proportion to any legitimate interest Benice may have had, and therefore violated the FET standard.\"278\n\nMem., \u00b6359, citing Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6106, **A-7**.\n\n251.\n\nIf the Tribunal had addressed the Claimants' argument regarding domestic law, \"the Tribunal would have had to assess the Annulment Request in light of all alleged breaches of the BIT that Claimants associated with this event.\"279 For the Applicants, the Tribunal's ultimate decision on the merits, and its decision on reparation, could have been different.280\n\nMem., \u00b6361.\n\nReply, \u00b6307.\n\n252.\n\nInvoking Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i), the Applicants contend that the Tribunal's ignoring their argument concerning domestic law,281 and failing to explain why, amounted to a failure to address a particular question, and therefore a failure to state reasons for the Award, pursuant to Article 52(1)(e).282\n\nMem., \u00b6365; Reply, \u00b6288.\n\nMem., \u00b6367.\n\n253.\n\nThe Applicants claim that these same circumstances amounted to a serious departure from their right to be heard, thus warranting annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(d). In the Applicants' view, the Tribunal was obliged under this ground of annulment to consider every argument\u2014or at least the points \"critical to the tribunal's decision\"\u2014and all evidence or provide reasons why it does not consider certain arguments and evidence relevant.283 The Applicants explain that the Respondent's invocation of the committee's decision in *Iberdrola v. Guatemala* is inapposite, because in that case the issue regarding domestic law was plainly not outcome-determinative, as it is here.284\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6370-374; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6310, 315, citing *Perenco*, \u00b6125, **RLA-9**.\n\nMem., \u00b6314, citing to *Iberdrola Energia S.A. v. Republic of Guatemala (I)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5, Decision on Annulment, January 13, 2015, **RLA-11** (\"***Iberdrola***\").\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicants' position that the Tribunal failed to consider the Claimants' argument concerning the effect of domestic law does not provide any basis to partially annul the Award.\n\n255.\n\nAccording to Respondent, even the Applicants \"openly admit\" that this was an \"'*argument*'\" (not a claim), and \"that the Tribunal acknowledged and summarized their argument.\"285 \"This is sufficient to dismiss the\" argument under either Article 52(1)(e)286 or 52(1)(d).287\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6156, citing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6348-349, 352, 361, 363, 371; Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 95, citing *Orascom*, \u00b6319, **RLA-28**.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6157, citing *Kili\u00e7*, \u00b6133, **RLA-19**; *Continental Casualty*, \u00b6130, **RLA-7**; C-Mem., \u00a7 3.2, \u00b6\u00b660-61 and accompanying citations.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 157, citing *Continental Casualty*, \u00b6 97, **RLA-7**; C-Mem., \u00a7 3.1, \u00b6\u00b6 44-47 and accompanying citations.\n\n256.\n\nAdditionally, specifically as regards Article 52(1)(e), the Respondent asserts that an award must be considered in its entirety when assessing whether a tribunal has provided reasons for its decisions. In this regard, the Respondent's position is that the Tribunal implicitly deemed the argument at hand to be irrelevant.288\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6150-151.\n\n257.\n\nThe Respondent does not agree that the Claimants highlighted the argument at issue as highly relevant or critical, given that it was given short shrift in the written procedure.289\n\nRej., \u00b6189.\n\n258.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent explains that the Tribunal did consider the argument, but that the Applicants have not even correctly framed the Tribunal's finding that is under attack. The Tribunal's finding at issue is more rightly described as \"there can be no violation of the Treaty's FET standard for arbitrariness when the challenged conduct is legitimate under domestic law.\"290 The Respondent disputes that the Tribunal justified the behavior of the Czech Republic's actors by stating that they merely complied with Czech law.\n\n*On the contrary, the Tribunal found that the system of checks balances developed by Czech law worked as an investor could and should have expected, and on this basis there was no breach of the Treaty. In other words, the Tribunal did not find a breach of the Treaty that was subsequently justified by invoking domestic law of the host state. The Tribunal simply determined that the Benice Assembly District's decision to file the annulment request did not amount to a violation of the Treaty.291*\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6159; Rej., \u00b6190.\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 96; Hr. Tr. 101:15-25.\n\n259.\n\nThus, the Respondent asserts that at no point did the Tribunal seek to justify the behavior of the Czech actors by arguing that they complied with Czech law. Rather it considered that the domestic legality of the impugned action precluded the State's liability for arbitrariness.292\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6160.\n\n260.\n\nNor was this an outcome-determinative issue in the Respondent's view.293 The alleged failure to consider the argument that a State may not rely on domestic law compliance to excuse a BIT violation would not have altered the Tribunal's decision \"in the slightest,\" according to the Respondent, because the Tribunal did not even find a breach of the Treaty with regard to the filing of the Annulment Request, which the Tribunal then justified by the invocation of domestic law.294 In an analysis of the Czech legal system, the Tribunal amply justified its finding that the system worked as any investor could have expected, and the Benice District adhered to proper administrative procedure.295\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6162; Rej., \u00b6192.\n\nRej., \u00b6193.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6194-195.\n\n261.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Applicants invocation of Article 52(1)(d) also fails. The right to be heard does not require that a tribunal give express consideration to every argument or issue. The Respondent emphasizes the findings of the committee in *Iberdrola v. Guatemala*, which \"plainly confirm that Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention cannot accommodate a complaint regarding a tribunal's alleged failure to explicitly address an argument that domestic law does not excuse a treaty violation since it is a mere argument, not a claim.\"296\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6153, citing *Iberdrola*, \u00b615, **RLA-11**; Rej., \u00b6200.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe decision of the Tribunal to which this annulment ground relates appears at paragraphs 389-390 of the Award, where, having first considered that the Czech court judgments do not infringe Article 4 of the BIT, the Tribunal considered that the decision by the District of Benice to file the Annulment Request does not result in a violation of the BIT either. Rather, as highlighted by the Respondent, the Tribunal considered that\n\n*[t]he system of checks and balances developed by Czech law worked as any investor could and should have expected: the political decision of the Prague City Assembly was conditional upon review as to its legality by the Czech Courts. Any aggrieved party had the right to request such review. Two affected citizens plus the District of Benice did so. The District acted under the instruction of its highest organ, the Assembly; it exercised its legal right to challenge the Zoning Plan Change, and it did so adhering to proper administrative procedure.*\n\n263.\n\nThis argument appears to amount to an example of ships passing in the night. It is clear that Claimants in the Arbitration did not invoke a denial of justice, neither as regards the decision of the Courts or the decision of the District of Benice to file the Annulment Request. While it is true that a state's exercise of its legal rights under domestic laws does not preclude a violation of FET, that truism cannot be turned around; *i.e*., it is not the case that any\u2014potential\u2014breach of domestic law in and of itself constitutes a breach of the FET standard or another standard contained in the BIT.\n\n264.\n\nIn this case, the Applicants' arguments relate to the decision of the District of Benice to file an Annulment Request. The Tribunal found that the District's decision to do so did not\u2014as such\u2014amount to a violation of the BIT. Logically, therefore, for the State's conduct to amount to a breach of the BIT, the onus was on the Claimants to show that despite the Tribunal's finding that the Annulment Request as such was legitimate, the State's conduct otherwise or more generally amounted to a breach, in particular of the FET standard contained in Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n265.\n\nAnd that is exactly what Claimants have sought to do in the Arbitration, arguing, *inter alia*, that the Benice District acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner, and specifically that the filing of the Annulment Request was an arbitrary and disproportionate measure297 in that the filing of the Request was a use of a legal process for a purpose for which it was not intended, all in violation of the FET standard.298\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6374, **A-1**, citing Claimants' Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6253-262, **A-6**; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6104, 106-107, **A-7**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6320, **A-1**, citing Claimants' Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6253-262, **A-6**; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6104, **A-7**.\n\n266.\n\nAfter reviewing the facts and arguments invoked by Claimants, the Tribunal determined, as noted above, that the relevant administrative procedure provided for checks and balances, and included a review of legality of the Zoning Plan Change, a review which two affected citizens and the District of Benice could and did instigate. Furthermore, the Tribunal elaborated on why the decision to file the Annulment Request was not an arbitrary act,299 nor disproportionate.300\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6393-398, **A-1**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6399-409, **A-1**.\n\n267.\n\nArguably a more logical sequence might have been to consider these two components of the Tribunal's decision up front before stating its conclusion that the decision of the District of Benice to file the Annulment request does not result in a violation of the BIT.301 Be that as it may, it is for the Tribunal to choose its way of expressing the basis for its decisions,302 and it cannot be said that the Tribunal's decision rests on a mere conclusion that the measure at issue was in accordance with domestic law, and therefore justified as a matter of international law.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6398, **A-1**.\n\nSee supra, citing *Wena*, \u00b681, **ALA-4.**\n\n268.\n\nIn sum, there is no basis for the Applicants' allegation that the Tribunal ignored or failed to explain its rationale on this issue, nor that the Tribunal failed to consider their arguments concerning domestic law, and thus there was no failure to state reasons pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) or a violation of the right to be heard pursuant to Article 52(1)(d).\n\n**F. Ground 6: The Tribunal's Alleged Lack of Reasons Regarding the Two- Year Period to Challenge the Zoning Plan Change**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe Applicants affirm that it was undisputed between the Parties that a measure adopting a zoning change may be challenged in court by any affected person. This notion was confirmed by the Claimants' legal expert Professor Doctor Veronika Tomoszkov\u00e1 in her expert opinion. According to the Applicants, neither Party questioned the matter further in the written or oral procedures.303\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6375-378, citing Expert Legal Opinion of Prof. Dr. Veronika Tomoszkov\u00e1, June 27, 2018, \u00b663, **A-44.**\n\n270.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal noted that the Zoning Plan Change was subject to judicial review. The Applicants explain, however, that the Tribunal inexplicably stated that \"Czech law provides for a two-year period during which any change to the zoning plan can be challenged before the Courts.\"304 The Tribunal further stated in the Award that \"there was a two-year statute of limitations for annulment requests.\"305\n\nMem., \u00b6380, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6644, **A-1**.\n\nMem., \u00b6381, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6701, **A-1**.\n\n271.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal expressed its view that,\n\n*The summary of the facts shows that Projekt Sever never had acquired a right that the Project Area be considered as residential. At best, after the initial approval of the Zoning Plan Change by the Assembly, it had an expectation that, if the period of limitation lapsed and no annulment request was filed (or the request was filed but rejected), the approval would become final, and the land would then definitively be considered as zoned for residential use.*306\n\nMem., \u00b6382, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6702, **A-1**.\n\n272.\n\nThe Applicants insist that the Tribunal's reasoning above\u2014referencing a two-year period to file an annulment\u2014is not in line with the facts or Czech law. The Tribunal cited the Hearing Transcript in this regard, but there is no mention in the transcript of the two-year period. Nor is there any reference to a two-year limitations period elsewhere in the record. Therefore, the Applicants state that the Award \"is not only groundless but also incorrect, and substantively wrong.\"307 They observe that the Respondent agrees that this conclusion was in error.308\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6383-386.\n\nReply, \u00b6329, citing C-Mem., \u00b6175.\n\n273.\n\nHere, the Applicants are careful to explain that this ground for annulment does not seek an appeal of the Tribunal's error. Instead, the Applicants seek partial annulment because the Tribunal provided no reasons or at best frivolous or contradictory reasons for its conclusion regarding the two-year limitations period.309\n\nReply, \u00b6321.\n\n274.\n\nIn fact, the Applicants explain that there was no limitations period at the time when Change Z 1294/07 was challenged and annulled.310 The Applicants argue that the relevant point in time is 2010, when the zoning change was decided by the city of Prague, at which time there was no time limit.311 It was only in 2012 that a three-year time limit was introduced.312\n\nHr. Tr. 53:20-54:1 (\"The two-year period for filing a lawsuit for the annulment of zoning plan changes did not exist at the time when the respective zoning plan change was adopted, when it was challenged, when it was annulled. In fact, there was no time limitation in any provision of Czech law at the time of approval of the zoning plan change\").\n\nHr. Tr. 130:14-16.\n\nHr. Tr. 130:8-13.\n\n275.\n\nAnd even if there was a two-year limitations period, then the borough's Annulment Request would have been time barred. The Zoning Plan Change was approved on March 26, 2010, and entered into force on April 16, 2010. The borough filed its annulment request more than two years after that date on June 28, 2012.313\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6386, 388-389.\n\n276.\n\nThe Applicants explain that the Tribunal's misplaced conclusions have had decisive effects on the Award concerning fair and equitable treatment, unreasonable measures, and indirect expropriation.314\n\nMem., \u00b6392.\n\n277.\n\nCritically, the Applicants explain, the Tribunal analyzed these three issues on the basis that the approval of the Zoning Plan Change was not final and still subject to annulment. As a result, the Tribunal deemed the Zoning Plan Change to be \"conditional upon review as to its legality by the Czech Courts.\"315 In turn, and finding that the Claimants had no acquired right, upon approval of the Zoning Plan Change, the Tribunal found no breach of the relevant Treaty provisions.316\n\nMem., \u00b6393, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6390, **A-1**.; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6327-328.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6395, 398.\n\n278.\n\nThe Respondent's approach is nonsensical in the Applicants' view: the Respondent says that a political decision to approve a Zoning Plan Change is never final and remains conditional, given that there was no time limit after which the change could not have been challenged.317\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6333-336. Hr. Tr. 130:23-131:1.\n\n279.\n\nIndeed, the only interpretation that is plausible under the correct application of the law as it existed is that a political decision to approve a Zoning Plan Change is final and accords an acquired right once it enters into force, though it may be later subjected to judicial review. Benice's Annulment Request should have been rightly regarded as intervening on that right, and the Tribunal would have reached substantially different conclusions with respect to its findings on the three issues above invoking violations of Articles 4 and 6 of the Treaty.318\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6400-401; Reply, \u00b6337.\n\n280.\n\nThe Applicants claim that, on this basis, the Award is subject to annulment for a failure to state reasons\u2014or for having provided at best frivolous or contradictory reasons319\u2014 pursuant to Article 52(1)(e). The Applicants refer to the conclusion of the committee in *MINE v. Guinea*, where it stated that the award shall enable one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from point A to point B and eventually to its conclusion. They explain, however, that \"[t]his is exactly what cannot be done in this case,\" as the Award does not make it possible to follow how the Tribunal concluded that a two-year limitation existed.320 Applying the *MINE* test, the Applicants submit that the relevant steps are as follows:\n\n*Here point A is the hearing transcript providing the information on the two-year period. Point B is that our zoning plan change could have been challenged by any affected party for two years after it entered into force. Point C is that within this period, the District of Benice and two affected citizens did so by filing of the annulment request. Then, point D and following points were the Tribunal's conclusions that with respect to the previous points, Claimants never acquired their right which related to its final decision on a non-violation of Article 4 and Article 6 of the BIT.*321\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6359-363; Applicants' Opening Statement, slides 67-68.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6403-404; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6349-356.\n\nHr. Tr. 54:24-55:10.\n\n281.\n\nRelying on the *Vivendi v. Argentina* committee, the Applicants underscore that they need not show that the failure to state reasons was \"manifest\" or \"serious.\" Nevertheless, the Tribunal's findings in this regard were outcome-determinative, as the Tribunal \"would have issued a substantially different decision on the merits.\"322\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6408-409, citing *Vivendi*, \u00b664, **ALA-13**; Reply, \u00b6338.\n\n282.\n\nIn the alternative, the Applicants again point to *MINE v. Guinea*, *CDC Group v. Seychelles*, and *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru* to explain that reasons provided in an award may not be contradictory or frivolous.323 They explain that the Tribunal's finding that the Zoning Plan Change was \"conditional\" for two-years when there was no such time limitation is frivolous. For the Applicants, the notion was \"plucked out of the air.\"324 They also argue that the Tribunal's explanations with regard to the date of filing of the Annulment Request after two years are also contradictory given that the Tribunal first opined there was a two- year limitations period for the filing of the Annulment Request but then observed that its filing beyond two years was permissible.325\n\nMem., \u00b6405, citing to *MINE*, \u00b65.09, **ALA-5**; *CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on the Application for Annulment, June 29, 2005, \u00b670, **ALA-10**; *Tza Yap Shum*, \u00b6101, **ALA-11**.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6360-362.\n\nMem., \u00b6406; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6367-370.\n\n283.\n\nNor can the Committee, in its discretion, attempt to clarify the Tribunal's reasoning on this critical issue given that a two-year limitations period never existed.326\n\nReply, \u00b6358, citing Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6106, **ALA-3.**\n\n284.\n\nLastly, the Applicants argue that annulment is warranted pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) on the basis that the Applicants were denied their right to be heard. They observe that the issue of when the Zoning Plan Change was (or was not) subject to review was not before the Tribunal as an issue to be decided. This is a violation of the right to be heard because \"a tribunal should not surprise the parties with an issue that neither party brought to the record.\"327 As the Parties were deprived of the opportunity to address, and perhaps correct, the Tribunal regarding the lack of a limitations period, the Tribunal's related merits rulings could have differed.328\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6377-378, citing *Global Telecom*, \u00b668, **ALA-22.**\n\nReply, \u00b6382.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe Respondent gives five reasons as to why this ground may not give rise to annulment. First, the Applicants' complaint is not based on the absence of reasoning from the Award, but for the Respondent, it is based on a substantive error. Citing *Orascom v. Algeria*, the Respondent confirms that \"even 'a manifestly incorrect application of the law [] is not a ground for annulment.'\"329 Nor is a mistake or unsupported finding by the Tribunal\u2014even manifest error is not a ground for annulment.330\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6168-169, quoting *Orascom*, \u00b6166, **RLA-28**; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6202-206; Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 103, citing *MINE*, \u00b65.08, **ALA-5** (\"a manifestly incorrect application of the law [\u2026] is not a ground for annulment\"). See also Hr. Tr. 104:19-22.\n\nRej., \u00b6212.\n\n286.\n\nSecond, the Respondent states that the Award does enable the reader to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusion. The Respondent explains that in finding no violation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal justified its conclusion that a decision to approve a zoning plan change in Prague is not final because it is subject to judicial review for two years. The Respondent continues, \"[i]rrespective of whether or not this was correct, the Tribunal's explanations in this respect are clear and consistent and perfectly demonstrate its reasoning reaching the conclusion of a non-violation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\"331\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6171.\n\n287.\n\nThe Respondent also explained its position that the Tribunal provided \"clear reasons\" for finding that the Zoning Plan Change was conditional, citing the Respondent's arguments in this regard in the original proceeding and the Claimants' legal expert Professor Doctor Tomaszkova. Thus, the Tribunal did proceed from \"Point A to Point B\" and fulfilled its duty to state reasons. Whether the Tribunal was factually incorrect about \"Point A\" is irrelevant, according to the Respondent.332\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6172; Rej., \u00b6214; Hr. Tr 106:14-16.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent does indeed agree with the Applicants that the issue of a time bar for challenging a zoning plan change was neither disputed nor put to the Tribunal.333 Citing *Wena Hotels v. Egypt*, the Respondent explains that an award cannot be annulled for lack of reasons regarding arguments that have not been presented to the tribunal.334\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 173 (\"the time-limit ... was never a question put to the Tribunal\" or \"disputed or addressed between the Parties in detail\").\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6173, citing *Wena*, \u00b682, **ALA-4**.\n\n289.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent's witness, Mr. Ondrej Bohac of the Prague Institute of Planning and Development, did mention a two-year time limit for challenging changes to the zoning plan: \"[t]he Change can be challenged in court for two years thereafter.\" The Respondent parroted this testimony in its Post-Hearing Brief. It appears that in the Award, the Tribunal's citation to the witness testimony was wrong, but the cite for the Post-Hearing Brief was correct. The Tribunals' mention of the two-year limitations period was supported in the record and not \"plucked out of the air.\"335\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6218-220, citing to Merits Hr. Tr., January 28, 2020, 542:25-543:1, **A-30**.\n\n290.\n\nThird, it was not \"frivolous\" for the Tribunal to have found that the Zoning Plan Change was conditional for a period of two years. The Tribunal's reasoning still stands on this issue no matter whether there was a two-year time bar because \"what matters is that the zoning change was to be understood as being subject to potential annulment.\"336 What matters is that the time-limit was mentioned during the proceedings. This finding was substantiated at the hearing by Professor Kadecka's testimony that \"no one has any public right to th[e] zoning plan change.\"337 And in any event, there is evidence supporting the Tribunal's finding that Czech law provides for a two-year period during which any change to the zoning plan can be challenged.338\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6175; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6223-224.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6175, citing Merits Hr. Tr., January 29, 2020, 961:9-16, **A-31**; Hr. Tr. 108:12-13.\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 107.\n\n291.\n\nFourth, the Respondent does not agree that this issue is outcome-determinative. Again, the Respondent says that no matter the time limitation, the key fact is that the Zoning Plan Change was subject to judicial review. Thus, the Respondent emphasizes that the Zoning Plan Change was not definitive, and as such the Tribunal's findings were neither frivolous nor contradictory. The Respondent also disagrees that the Tribunal's finding on indirect expropriation would have been different because the Tribunal gave reasons for its decision in this regard\u2014that the Zoning Plan Change \"never became final and definitive\" and there was no acquired right to expropriate. The Respondent also reminds that the Tribunal added that even if the Claimants had acquired a right through the zoning change, they did not prove any interference with their investment justifying a finding of indirect expropriation.339 In any event, because Czech law did provide a time limit within which the annulment of a zoning plan change can be requested, the Tribunal's alleged mistake was not \"outcome-determinative.\"340\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6177-179; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6226-228.\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 108.\n\n292.\n\nFifth, the Respondent argues that there can be no annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) for a violation of the right to be heard. The Applicants misstate the Parties' submissions in relation to the Zoning Plan Change and its review. Rather than never having been discussed, as argued by the Applicants, the Respondent posits that it was \"the central issue\" in that neither Party had questioned the right to challenge the Zoning Plan Change. It is for this reason that the issue was not developed in depth. According to the committee in *Klockner v. Cameroon*, \"arbitrators must be free to rely on arguments which strike them as the best ones, even if those arguments were not developed by the parties (although they could have been).\"341 The issue at hand was mentioned in the record and could have been seized upon further.342\n\nRej., \u00b6232, quoting *Kl\u00f6ckner*, \u00b691, **ALA-9** (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nRej., \u00b6237. Hr. Tr. 111:20-23 (\"the right to be heard hinges on whether the parties were given the opportunity to present their case, not on whether they chose to seize that opportunity.\")\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThis annulment ground relates to the Tribunal's reference in its Award to a two-year time limit for filing a request for judicial review of a zoning change, as a building block for its decision that there had been no breach of the FET standard pursuant to Article 4 of the BIT and no indirect expropriation pursuant to Article 6 of the BIT essentially because the Claimants had no acquired right.343\n\nApplicants also suggest the reference impacts the decision in relation to the decision regarding unreasonable measures, Mem., \u00b6392, but the reference appears to relate only to FET and expropriation.\n\n294.\n\nAs to legitimate expectations, the Tribunal referred to five considerations in support of its conclusion that the conduct of the Districts of Uh\u0159\u00edn\u011bves and Benice, and of the Municipal authorities of Prague, did not generate a legitimate expectation, to the benefit of the Claimants, that the Zoning Plan Change would be authorized by the Prague Assembly and that the Residential Complex could be successfully promoted.344 The fifth and final step in the tribunal's reasoning was that the Zoning Plan Change did not create an acquired right because it was still subject to judicial review.345 However, this was not the only basis of the Tribunal's reasoning. It equally held that the Claimants had failed to meet the other elements required to establish a claim based on legitimate expectations, such as the allocation of risk in the underlying contracts and the absence of a specific and unambiguous declaration binding on either of the relevant municipalities, which in any event would not have been competent to make such commitment, and thus they could not be deemed reasonable.346\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6645, **A-1**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6644, **A-1**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6629-643, **A-1**.\n\n295.\n\nSimilarly, the decision regarding expropriation was not only based on the consideration that Projekt Sever never had an acquired right that the project area be considered as residential,347 but also that even if the Claimants had acquired a specific right (\"*quod non*\") they had failed to prove any interference with their property rights that would have been sufficiently restrictive, permanent and irreversible to justify a finding of indirect expropriation.348\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6702, **A-1**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6705, **A-1**. As the Tribunal pointed out, the \"Claimants remain the owners of the same land that they purchased in 2007 and they remain entitled to initiate a procedure that could lead to a future zoning change. [citation omitted] [T]here is still a possibility that the land may eventually be designated as residential.\" Id., \u00b6706.\n\n296.\n\nIn the Arbitration, it was undisputed between the parties that the measure adopting a zoning plan change could be challenged in court by any affected person.349 Apparently, in 2010, when the Zoning Plan Change was approved, there was no explicit statutory time limit for such review although this was subsequently introduced. The issues of a time limit, the duration thereof, and the relevant date for the commencement of such a time limit was not debated in the Arbitration.\n\nSee supra, \u00b6\u00b6274, 293.\n\n297.\n\nEqually, it does not appear to have played a role in the judicial review procedure, which led to the annulment of the Zoning Plan Change.350 The existence of a two-year time limit was mentioned by a witness of the Respondent and referred to by the Respondent in its Post-Hearing Brief, but not, as stated above, the subject of any discussion between the Parties.\n\nA three-year time limit was introduced in 2012, although this was subsequently amended more than once. See Hr. Tr. 130:17-22.\n\n298.\n\nWhile there is therefore a reference to a two-year time limit in the record in the Arbitration, it is not in the witness testimony cited by the Tribunal, and apparently incorrect. Paradoxically, it is the incorrectness which appears to explain why judicial review could take place: either because there was no time limit considered relevant by the court or because the relevant time limit was three years and not two years as\u2014incorrectly\u2014stated by the Tribunal.\n\n299.\n\nFirst, the review pursuant to Article 52(1)(e), does not entitle a committee to review the correctness or the persuasiveness of a tribunal's reasoning. Rather, the question is whether the reasons relate to the issues before the tribunal and can be followed.351 Furthermore, in undertaking its review, a committee must look at the totality of the award to understand the motivation of the decision, and not just particular parts.352 Moreover, even a manifestly incorrect application of the law is not a ground for annulment.353\n\n*Vivendi I*, \u00b6\u00b664-65, **ALA-13**.\n\nRej., \u00b668, citing *Hydro*, \u00b6115, **RLA-43**.\n\n*MINE*, \u00b65.08, **ALA-5**.\n\n300.\n\nIn this case, although the Tribunal's Award contains an incorrect reference (incorrect both as a citation and as a reference to and computation of the applicable time limit), the Applicants have not established that these issues (i) have had a material impact on the outcome the Tribunal's decision overall or (ii) resulted in the Award having failed to meet the requirements of the *MINE* standard or otherwise for lack of reasoning.\n\n301.\n\nAs considered above, the issue of an existing time limit was addressed in the context of whether the Claimants had an acquired right. For both sections in the Award where the issue of an acquired right was addressed, there were other, and independently supportive, reasons expressed by the Tribunal,354 so that even if with hindsight it could be said that the Claimants did have an acquired right, they would still not have met the threshold of either a breach of FET or expropriation. In applying its review, a committee must \"look to the totality of an award to understand the motivation of the decision, and not just particular parts.\"355\n\nAward, \u00b6644.\n\nRej., \u00b668, citing *Hydro*, \u00b6115, **RLA-43**.\n\n302.\n\nSecond, the critical component of the Tribunal's reasoning was that judicial review was still open, which proved to be factually correct. As considered above, the Applicants have not disputed that under Czech law a change to a zoning plan can be challenged before the Czech Courts. The Committee has taken note of the fact that the relevant provisions of the Act of Judicial Administrative Procedure and the Code of Administrative Judicial Procedure, introducing a three-year time limit for requesting an annulment of a zoning change did not form part of the record in the Arbitration. As the Applicants confirmed during the hearing, neither of the Parties submitted the relevant law into the record.356\n\nHr. Tr. 58:16-17. See also Mem. \u00b6377.\n\n303.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal paid more attention to the time limit than the Parties had done in their debate,357 but the upshot of the Tribunal's decision was the conditionality of the zoning plan which was borne out by the effectiveness of the judicial review proceedings. For that reason, the Committee does not agree with the Applicants that the Tribunal's decision was a \"surprise\" decision depriving them of an effective opportunity to discuss or comment on the issue. The relevant building block in the Tribunal's reasoning was not so much the duration of the time limitation, as much as the (undisputed) conditionality. Clearly, the incorrect reference and computational error is unfortunate, but the Committee disagrees with the Claimants that had the Tribunal been fully briefed on the actual time limitation, it would have come to a different *overall* conclusion.358 Presumably, the reference to the length of the applicable time limit would have been different, but it would not have made a difference to the conclusion that, because the zoning change could be and was annulled, Claimants never had an acquired right.\n\nCode of Administrative Judicial Procedure, **RA-10**, was only submitted in the Annulment proceeding, as Respondent confirmed at the hearing. See Hr. Tr. 160:20-161:10.\n\nSee Hr. Tr. 59:24-60:1.\n\n304.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects the argument that the Tribunal's decision constitutes a breach of the right to be heard under the standards of Article 52(1)(d). While the modalities of the conditionality of the zoning change may not have been discussed in the Arbitration, and the Award contains an error as regards the time limitation, the Applicants seek to attribute a significance and relevance to these modalities and error that are belied by the decision of the Tribunal, in particular its separate determination on zoning plan conditionality.\n\n305.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee also rejects the Applicants' submission that the Tribunal's decision amounts to a breach of Article 52(1)(e) as it fails to meet the *MINE v. Guinea* standard.359 The (incorrect) reference to the Hearing transcript is not the starting point (point A) of the Tribunal's decision. Rather, the relevant building block for the conclusion that Claimants never had an acquired right in the designation of the Projekt Sever as residential (point C)360 is that the decision of the Assembly never became final and definitive (point A), and that a Request for Annulment was filed and the decision was in fact annulled (point B).\n\nHr. Tr. 54-55.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6702, **A-1**.\n\n306.\n\nSimilarly, in paragraph 644 of the Award the structure of the reasoning of the Tribunal is to build up to the conclusion that the Zoning Plan Change did not create an acquired right (point C), in light of the existence of the possibility of judicial review (point A), and the absence of legitimate expectation that such review would not be exercised by those with legal standing (point B).\n\n307.\n\nFor the same reason, it cannot be said that the Tribunal's reasoning was frivolous or contradictory and therefore does not meet the standard of Article 52(1)(e). The Applicants correctly point out that there was no evidence supporting the two-year time limit, which in any event appears to be explained by the fact that this was a non-issue between the Parties. But the Applicants are not correct in contending that this was a \"conclusion.\"361 Rather, it was an incorrect but ultimately immaterial building block for the Tribunal's subsequent conclusion that the Claimants did not have an acquired right. Despite that the reference and the computation were in error in the Award, annulment is not warranted where the Applicants have not established a lack of substantiation for the overall conclusion that a Request for Annulment could be and was filed.\n\nHr. Tr. 56:21.\n\n308.\n\nIn sum, if the submissions made in the annulment had been presented in the Arbitration, the Tribunal may have reformulated certain references (the Committee notes that the Applicants appear to have introduced a new element to its argumentation that judicial review is an extraordinary measure, the assessment of which exceeds the Committee's mandate). However, the Committee cannot endorse the Applicants' position that the Tribunal's reasoning leading up to its conclusion cannot be followed, and therefore also rejects this ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n**G. Ground 7: The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Address Claimants'Arguments Regarding Continuity in Decision Making and Estoppel**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nIn the Arbitration, the Claimants argued that Benice's Annulment Request and \"subsequent steps\" attributable to the Czech Republic were arbitrary and violated fair and equitable treatment because they lacked continuity in decision making. They specifically invoked *Crystallex v. Venezuela* for the premise that a State violates the fair and equitable treatment standard where local officials first supported a project but later changed their position due to a change in the political climate.362\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6411-412. Hr. Tr. 43:25-44:5.\n\n310.\n\nThe Applicants say that the record in the Arbitration contained facts and evidence concerning Benice's obligation to preserve continuity.363 This includes, in particular, the KAAMA Study, a study\u2014supportive of the Zoning Plan Change\u2014that was on file in the Benice's district office since Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 took office in 2006 but was used as one of the bases on which to seek annulment of the Zoning Plan Change.364 The Applicants also point to Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1's own testimony, where she indicated that when she took office, she \"read the documentation related to the re-zoning proposal, whatever was available at the time.\" The Applicants infer that the mayor \"must have been aware of the size and scope of the development that Benice had been pursuing when it applied for the zoning plan change in 2004.\"365\n\nThe Applicants dispute the Respondent's contention in the Counter-Memorial at paragraph 184 that the argument that the authorities were required to preserve continuity was not raised in the written procedure of the original proceeding in relation to the claim of arbitrariness but only with respect to the claim of breach of legitimate expectations, and proceed to detail where in the record the arguments appeared in the Reply at paragraphs 386-390.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6413-414.\n\nMem., \u00b6414, quoting Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b673, **A-7**.\n\n311.\n\nWhile the Respondent had suggested that a new government is entitled to change course in its decision making, the Applicants point out that the relevant officials\u2014the mayor and other officials\u2014had not changed post during the relevant period.366\n\nMem., \u00b6415, quoting Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b673, **A-7**.\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimants had also invoked the principle of estoppel, asserting that the City of Prague had an obligation to protect Claimants' investment and not disparage or undercut a concession granted by a predecessor government.367\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6417-418.\n\n313.\n\nThe Applicants state that \"the Tribunal paid no attention\" to these arguments in the Award and did not explain why they were disregarded. Had the Tribunal addressed these arguments, the Applicants insist that the Tribunal would have reached a different outcome with regard to (i) a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard at Article 4(1) of the Treaty and (ii) reparation.368\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6424-428.\n\n314.\n\nFor the Applicants, given that the Tribunal did not analyze these (potentially) outcome-determinative issues regarding continuity and estoppel in the Award and failed to explain why, the Tribunal failed to \"address a particular question\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e), and thus the Award is subject to annulment.369\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6429-433; see Reply, \u00b6\u00b6393-403.\n\n315.\n\nThe Applicants also again claim that the Tribunal's failure to consider the Respondent's arguments on these issues warrants annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(d), given that the Tribunal failed to consider certain arguments critical to the Tribunal's decision or provide reasons why such arguments were irrelevant.370\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6435-439; see Reply, \u00b6\u00b6404-410. Applicants' Opening Statement, slides 12-13.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent gives five reasons as to why this ground may not give rise to annulment. First, the Tribunal did indeed consider, and reject, the Claimants' arguments on continuity and estoppel. For the Respondent, though, the Claimants never invoked these arguments with regard to arbitrariness. This is something that the Applicants raised for the first time in this Annulment Proceeding. Instead, these arguments were raised with regard to legitimate expectations. And the Respondent observes that the portions of the pleadings and the Award that the Applicants cite to all point to sections on legitimate expectations and not arbitrariness.371 The Respondent states that the Committee is not empowered to review these merits findings, citing *Kl\u00f6ckner v.

There is consensus, according to the Respondent, among prior committees that tribunals are not required to address all arguments or authorities raised to satisfy the requirement for a statement of reasons under Article 52(1)(e). Nor is \"express consideration\" of every argument required to satisfy the right to be \"heard\" pursuant to Article 52(1)(d).373\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6186-189; Rej., \u00b6246; Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 114, citing *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment of the Award, November 2, 2015, \u00b6101, **RLA-1** (\"***Occidental***\").\n\n318.\n\nThird, invoking *Continental Casualty v. Argentina* and *UAB v. Latvia*, the Respondent repeats that the Tribunal cannot be accused of failing to state reasons regarding an argument that was raised to support a different claim.374 Nowhere in their arbitral submissions did the Claimants allege that their arguments for arbitrariness and breach of legitimate expectations were somehow connected.375\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6192 citing *UAB E energija (Lithuania) v. Republic of Latvia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/33, Decision on Annulment, April 8, 2020, \u00b6190, **RLA-33** (quoting *Wena*, \u00b682, **ALA-4**); *Cortec*, \u00b6228(e), **RLA-30**.

The Respondent says that the Applicants are saying that it would have without explaining why. The Respondent also notes that the Tribunal found these concepts to be irrelevant and immaterial to the Claimants' arguments on legitimate expectations, and thus it would have likely reached the same conclusion with regard to arbitrariness in any event.376\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6194-196; Rej., \u00b6254. Hr. Tr. 115, Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 116.\n\n320.\n\nFifth, the alleged failure of a tribunal to address an argument raised by a Party is not automatically a breach of the right to be heard.377 There is no dispute that the Tribunal afforded both Parties the opportunity to present its case, including in relation to continuity and estoppel. In any event, it is mere speculation that had the issue been raised in the way that the Applicants have framed it on annulment that the outcome of the Award would have changed.378\n\nRej., \u00b6256, citing *Watkins Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l. and others v.

Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 117.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Applicants' argument is twofold: first they allege that the Tribunal's failure to address Claimants' argument that Benice's District Assembly's filing of the Annulment Request constituted a failure to respect continuity and thus a violation of the FET standard by the imposition of arbitrary measures. The Applicants refer in this respect to their submissions in the Arbitration, specifically its submission in the Post-Hearing Brief that Benice's support of the Zoning Change from 2002 to 2012 obligated Benice to refrain from filing a lawsuit in 2012 to annul the Zoning Plan Change.379 In relation to this component of their argument, they submit that there is no justification for this change of course as a result of a change of government, because the Mayor of Benice had been in charge all along and was aware of relevant studies relating to the Project.\n\nMem., n. 300, citing Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b673, **A-7**.\n\n322.\n\nSecond, but separately, the Applicants point to the conduct of the City of Prague and submit that the new Government \"remained obligated to protect Claimants' investments\"380 and maintain that the Tribunal failed to \"[pay] attention to Claimants' argument [regarding] the principle of estoppel with respect to the City of Prague's actions.\"381 In describing the allegedly relevant conduct, however, the exact basis for estoppel, in particular in relation to the City's conduct is not made entirely clear. Claimants refer somewhat indiscriminately to conduct by multiple state officials, in various positions and in various levels of responsibility, over a period of five years.382\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, header above \u00b6154, **A-7.**\n\nMem., \u00b6420.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6156-157, **A-7**.\n\n323.\n\nFactually, the situation of the City of Prague differs from that of the district of Benice in at least one material respect, namely that in Prague, as a result of elections, a new government was in place. Be that as it may, in developing this annulment ground, the thrust of the Applicants' argument is that the Tribunal failed to do justice to their argument in the Arbitration that the State's conduct, notably its change in position in relation to the Project, amounted to a breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n324.\n\nThe Parties are divided on whether the argument of the failure to respect the principle of continuity in its decision-making was made both in relation to the allegation of the arbitrariness of the State's actions as well as in relation to the allegation of the breach of Claimants' legitimate expectations. The Applicants say it was, and argue that in the Arbitration they submitted that \"Benice's Annulment Request and subsequent steps attributable to the Czech Republic resulted in a violation of the FET, as this conduct was arbitrary.\"383 However, the reference to the Applicants' submissions in the Arbitration does not bear out the contention that there is a causal connection between the allegedly arbitrary conduct and the allegation of a breach of legitimate expectations.\n\nMem., \u00b6412; Reply, \u00b6388.\n\n325.\n\nThe Applicants refer to paragraphs 296-303 of their Memorial.384 These paragraphs, however, constitute Section 3 of chapter D, dealing with the obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment and not to impair investments by unreasonable measures. Section 1 addresses the Czech Republic's breach of good faith, and section 2 addresses the frustration of Claimants' legitimate expectations and violation of transparency. Section 3 is headed \"The Czech Republic's Conduct Was Arbitrary.\" The structure of this chapter and the juxtaposition of these sections effectively undermines the contention that the arguments contained in Section 3 (namely that the Czech Republic's conduct was arbitrary) constitute the basis for the submission in Section 2 (that the Republic violated the FET standard).\n\nSee Mem.,\u00b6412, n. 292; Reply, \u00b6388, n. 356.\n\n326.\n\nAs the Respondent submits, in addressing the Claimants' arguments in relation to the obligation to preserve continuity and the principle of estoppel (in the section dealing with legitimate expectations, which is where the Claimants raised them),385 the Tribunal dismissed the Claimants' claim for legitimate expectations considering that while the stability of the legislative and regulatory framework can be relevant to the investor's regulatory legitimate expectations, such regulatory expectations were not at issue in this case, where the Claimants' claim was based on their alleged \"direct legitimate expectation,\" which the Tribunal determined was not established.386\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6612-614, **A-1**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6645, **A-1**.\n\n327.\n\nMoreover, as set out above, this annulment ground is also compromised by the fact that while the Applicants address the legal basis of both prongs of its argument without distinguishing between the actions of the borough of Benice and City of Prague, the factual matrix of both elements of this argument differ in significant part.\n\n328.\n\nIn any event, the Committee agrees with the Respondent that even assuming the arguments in relation to continuity and estoppel had been raised in the context of arbitrariness, tribunals are not under the obligation to address every argument put forth by the parties in the context of Article 52(1)(e).387 It is the Tribunal's prerogative whether to consider an argument and to determine the relevance of arguments. As the committee in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* observed, tribunals have discretion to focus on those issues and arguments that they find determinative for their decision and making use of this discretion is not by itself a reason for annulment.388\n\nSee *Occidental*, \u00b6101, **RLA-1**; *MCI*, \u00b667, **ALA-32**; *Rumeli*, \u00b684, **RLA-17**; *Continental Casualty*, \u00b692, **RLA-7**.\n\nSee supra, \u00b679, citing *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, \u00b6133, **RLA-19**.\n\n329.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee agrees with the Respondent that even assuming the arguments of continuity and estoppel had been argued in relation to arbitrariness, such arguments would not have been outcome determinative. There is no indication that these arguments would have been evaluated any differently than they were in the context of legitimate expectations. A mere hypothesis that the outcome could potentially have been different is not sufficient to justify annulment.\n\n330.\n\nFinally, the Committee rejects the argument that the Tribunal's decision constitutes a breach of the Applicants' right to be heard pursuant to Article 52(1)(d). There is no support for the allegation that the Tribunal denied the Claimants their right to be heard; the Tribunal provided the Claimants ample opportunity to present their position; it considered and evaluated Claimants' arguments. The right to be heard does not relate to the manner in which tribunals deal with the arguments and evidence presented.389 As noted above, speculation that the outcome could have been different does not justify annulment.\n\n*Watkins*, \u00b6\u00b6283, 295, **ALA-28**.\n\n**H. Ground 8: The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Address the Circumstances of the June 21, 2012 Benice District Assembly Meeting**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nThe Applicants recall that on June 21, 2012, the Benice District Assembly passed a resolution to cooperate with the co-petitioners, Ms. \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nkov\u00e1 and Mr. Hepner \"to prevent the realization of the submitted Benice Residential Complex project or at least to minimize its scale.\"390 It was at this meeting, say the Applicants, that the District and its co-petitioners resolved to submit the Annulment Request.391\n\nMem., \u00b6440, quoting Resolution of the Benice district assembly, June 21, 2012, **A-17** (Exhibit C-76 in original proceeding).\n\nMem., \u00b6440.\n\n332.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, the Claimants emphasized the \"non-standard circumstances\" of this meeting in the Arbitration. First, the Claimants explained that when the Assembly approved the pursuit of the Annulment Request it did so without having examined any documentation or undertaken any planning or legal analysis. The Applicants contend the decision was based solely on the mayor's reference to a news article entitled \"problematic Benice Residential Complex Project.\"392\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6441-442.\n\n333.\n\nThe Claimants also showed in the Arbitration that the mayor proposed the submission of the Annulment Request to the district assembly without prior notice to them or the public. The item was not even on the meeting's agenda, and thus, Mr. Pawlowski or other representatives of the Claimants were not invited to defend their plans for the development to the district assembly prior to the vote. From this, the Applicants posit that the mayor plotted a \"vote by ambush\" where she did not want the district assembly to hear the other side.393\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6443-444; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6417-418.\n\n334.\n\nThe Applicants allege that, in the Award, the Tribunal paid \"no attention\" to this line of argument. The Tribunal did not even acknowledge that the Claimants had criticized the circumstances of the Benice District Assembly meeting. Instead, the Applicants say that the Tribunal interpreted the argument as having required notice to the Claimants, and the Tribunal found that there was no notice requirement.394\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6447-448; Reply, \u00b6423.\n\n335.\n\nThe Applicants insist, though, that the point of the Claimants' line of argument here was not the lack of notice to the Claimants, but that the overall circumstances of the vote to file the Annulment Request were irregular\u2014and these were not addressed by the Tribunal.395\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6449-450.\n\n336.\n\nFor the Applicants, the Tribunal's having side stepped this issue had a decisive effect on the Award given that the Claimants argued that the filing of the Annulment Request was arbitrary, unreasonable, and disproportionate pursuant to Article 4 of the BIT.396\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6451-454; Reply, \u00b6419.\n\n337.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal found no such violation because it found that the decision was taken by a democratic organ, the Benice District Assembly. It qualified, however, that, if the decision to file the Annulment Request was driven by the mayor, \"such conduct could constitute a breach of the FET standard enshrined in Article 4 of the BIT.\"397\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6452-453.\n\n338.\n\nThe Applicants insist that if the Tribunal had addressed the Claimants' argument, as it was presented, the decision on Article 4 and on reparation would have been different given that the record shows that the District Assembly's decision was made in an irregular way\u2014 under the influence and time pressure of the mayor.398\n\nMem., \u00b6456; Reply, \u00b6419.\n\n339.\n\nFor the Applicants, the Tribunal did not analyze the Claimants' arguments regarding the circumstances of the June 21, 2012, meeting in the Award and failed to explain why it did not. Thus, it failed to state reasons pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) on this potentially outcome-determinative issue and the Award is subject to annulment.399\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6458-465; Reply 412.\n\n340.\n\nThe Applicants also again claim that the Tribunal's failure to consider the Respondent's argument regarding the meeting warrants annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(d), which obliged the Tribunal to consider the aforesaid argument as a *\"*'*point critical to the tribunal's decision*'\"400 or provide reasons why it does not consider it to be relevant.401\n\nReply, \u00b6433 quoting Perenco \u00b6125, **RLA-9**.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6466-470; Reply, \u00b6432-437.\n\n**(2) The Respondents' Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Respondent provides four reasons for its disagreement with the view that the Tribunal's alleged failure to consider the circumstances of the June 21, 2012, Benice District Assembly meeting may give rise to annulment of the Award. First, the Applicants may not use this Annulment Proceeding to seek a retrial of their allegations that the Benice District Assembly meeting was a personal retaliatory decision by the mayor. The Respondent observes that that the Tribunal considered\u2014and rejected\u2014these allegations in the Award, expressly rejecting the notion of a vote by ambush.402 It is not the Committee's function to review the Tribunal's factual findings on the merits.403\n\nRej., \u00b6266, citing *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6390, 396, 397, 398, **A-1**.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6199-200.\n\n342.\n\nSecond, again, the Respondent argues that the grounds for annulment that the Applicants have invoked are not appropriate for the Tribunal's alleged failure to address a \"mere argument of Claimants relating to the 'circumstances of Benice District Assembly's meeting on June 21, 2012.'\"404 Invoking the decision in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, the Respondent reiterates that whether or not a given argument is deemed to be relevant is a matter for the Tribunal's discretion, and making use of that discretion is not a basis for finding a \"failure to state reasons\" pursuant to Article 52(1)(e).405 \"Express consideration\" of every argument is not required to be \"heard\" pursuant to Article 52(1)(d).406\n\nRej., \u00b6260, citing Mem., \u00b6446.\n\nRej., \u00b6263-264, citing *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, \u00b6133, **RLA-19**.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6201-205.\n\n343.\n\nThird, the Respondent asserts that when the Award is considered in its entirety that it is clear the Tribunal did address the Claimants' argument that Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 allegedly manipulated the Benice District Assembly's decision to file the Annulment Request. The Award itself says that the Tribunal considered whether \"Benice's decision to file the Annulment Request was driven by Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1\" and found it was \"not persuaded by [it].\"407\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6206.\n\n344.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that the Tribunal did justify its decision for its finding that the approval to file the Annulment Request was not irregular or a personal decision of the mayor. The Tribunal found that \"[p]ublic authorities are not under an obligation to provide advance notice of their intention to launch lawsuits which affect protected investors,\" and as such, the district assembly \"adher[ed] to proper administrative procedure.\"408\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6207, quoting *Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6\u00b6406, 390, 394, **A-1**.\n\n345.\n\nFourth, according to the Respondent, the Applicants have not shown that any alleged failure of the Tribunal to consider the circumstances of the June 21, 2012, meeting was outcome-determinative on Article 4 or on reparation. For the Respondent, the issue clearly was not outcome-determinative given that the Tribunal found that the decision was not motivated by the mayor, required no notice, and adhered to proper administrative procedure. Further, the subsequent judgments by the Courts retroactively justified the District's decision.409\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6209-212; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6268-269.\n\n346.\n\nFifth, the Respondent denies that the Applicants have shown a violation of their right to be heard under Article 52(1)(d). The absence or inadequate discussion of an argument \"does not automatically amount to a violation of the right to be heard.\"410 There is no debate that the Parties were given the opportunity to submit and present their respective arguments, and the arguments at issue here were indeed considered and deemed irrelevant. The Applicants' theory that the Tribunal would have found a violation of Article 4 and awarded reparations had it considered the overall circumstances of the vote is mere speculation.411\n\nRej., \u00b6271, citing *Watkins*, \u00b6\u00b6283, 295, **ALA-28.**\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6274-276.\n\n**(3) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe Applicants' submissions in relation to this annulment ground are a mixture of arguments of procedure and substance. For the reasons set forth below, the Committee rejects the Applicants' position that the Tribunal's decision in relation to the circumstances of the Benice District Assembly meeting of June 21, 2012, justifies annulment.\n\n348.\n\nThe Applicants' arguments are a blend of the allegation that the failure to place the resolution to file the Annulment Request on the agenda prior to the meeting resulted in a vote by ambush and precluded an adequate decision-making process. It appears that the focus of this argument evolved throughout the Arbitration. Initially, the Applicants focused more so on the (procedural) surprise element while later, faced with the fact that there was no formal requirement to place the issue on the agenda prior to the meeting, the Applicants dropped this argument and emphasized the more generic concerns about the adequacy of the process.412 Notably, on annulment, the Applicants advance precisely the argument that the Tribunal referenced (\"[\u2026] [a]nd Benice did so without giving Claimants any advance notice [\u2026]\"),413 and rejected.414\n\n\"Mayor Topi\u010dov\u00e1 put this proposal to the members of the Benice District Assembly without prior notice to them or to the public. As is clear from the June 21, 2012 Benice District Assembly Resolution, this item was not on the agenda for meeting and was instead added and then voted on during the same meeting rendering the vote irregular.\" Claimants' Reply on the Merits, \u00b6362, **A-6**.\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6400, **A-1.**\n\n*Pawlowski* Award, \u00b6404, **A-1.**\n\n349.\n\nFirst, the Committee recalls the considerations above that tribunals are not under the obligation to address every argument put forth by the parties under the standards of Article 52(1)(e).415 It is the tribunal's prerogative whether or not to consider an argument and to determine the relevance of arguments. As the committee in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* observed,416 tribunals have discretion to focus on those issues and arguments that they find determinative for their decision and making use of this discretion is not by itself a reason for annulment.417 Consequently, even if there were factual support for the Applicants' argument, it is not for the Applicants' to be the arbiter of what constitutes \"the crux\" of their arguments; that is the Tribunal's prerogative.\n\nSee *Occidental*, \u00b6101, **RLA-1**; *MCI*, \u00b667, **ALA-32**; *Rumeli*, \u00b684, **RLA-17**; *Continental Casualty*, \u00b692, **RLA-7**.\n\n*K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, \u00b6133, **RLA-19**.\n\nSee supra, \u00b679, *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, \u00b6133, **RLA-19**.\n\n350.\n\nFurthermore, in the Committee' view, the Applicants have not established that the issues in question were outcome-determinative for the case.418 Namely, the argument that the Assembly's decision \"may not have been as democratic as the Tribunal found\"419 and that a different procedure could have led to a different Award outcome in relation to a violation of the BIT and the Tribunal's decision on reparation is speculative. Moreover, the Tribunal's decision was based on a multi-tiered consideration that (i) the Assembly was acting within the law and its right; (ii) the decision was justified given the nature and size of the Project, and (iii) the decision was retroactively justified by judgments of the Courts.\n\nSee C-Mem., \u00b6209, citing *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on the Application for Annulment, December 18, 2012, \u00b686, **ALA-6**.\n\nMem., \u00b6455.\n\n351.\n\nFinally, the Committee rejects the argument that the Applicants have shown that they have been denied their right to be heard pursuant to Article 52(1)(d). There is no support for the allegation that the Tribunal denied the Claimants their right to be heard. The Tribunal provided the Claimants ample opportunity to present their position; it considered and evaluated the Claimants' arguments and did not deem them to have the relevance attributed thereto by the Claimants. The right to be heard does not, however, relate to the manner in which tribunals deal with the arguments and evidence presented.420 As noted above, speculation that the outcome could have been different does not justify annulment.\n\n*Watkins*, \u00b6\u00b6283, 295, **ALA-28**.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. The Applicants' Cost Submissions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nThe Applicants seek an order requiring that the Respondent pay the Applicants' costs of this Annulment proceeding (plus interest) as well as all costs and expenses of the arbitrators and the Centre.421\n\nMem., \u00b6471; Reply, \u00b6438.\n\n353.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Applicants had also sought annulment of the Award in relation to the Tribunal's cost order in the Arbitration,422 which led the Respondent to qualify this as a (putative) ninth ground for annulment.423\n\nMem., \u00b634.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6213-214.\n\n354.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Committee requested both Parties to clarify their position, and in particular whether the Applicants seek annulment of the cost order in the Arbitration.424 In response, the Applicants argued that it is not correct to assert that they lost the Arbitration.425 They submit that the Tribunal's order that costs were to be borne by both Parties was therefore surprising as it is a general principle of law that the losing party bears the costs of the proceedings in a dispute.426 Moreover, they submit that that in deciding on the costs in this way, the Tribunal also departed from fundamental rules of procedure, constituting a ground for annulment of the Award in respect to costs.427\n\nHr. Tr. 260:4-6.\n\nHr. Tr. 148:2-4.\n\nHr. Tr. 148:5-11.\n\nHr. Tr. 148:21-149:1.\n\n355.\n\nNevertheless, in their final submissions on this issue the Applicants posited that \"the decision on costs in the underlying arbitration is dependent on the decision on merits. That's why we submit that also the decisions on costs should be annulled, if the Committee would annul part of the Award as a whole. To be clear, we do not submit specific ground for annulment of the decision costs.\"428\n\nHr. Tr. 151:9-15.\n\n356.\n\nThus, the Applicants submit that the Respondent should bear all of the Applicants' costs and expenses of these proceedings totaling CZK 8,510,191.00, as well as the expended portion of the USD 405,025 in advances paid to ICSID.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nIn its written submissions, the Respondent observed that the Applicants seek annulment on the Tribunal's order of costs\u2014that \"each Party shall bear, in equal parts, the Costs of the Proceedings and [shall] be responsible for its own Legal Fees and Expenses.\"429\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6213; Rej., \u00b6277.\n\n358.\n\nThe Respondent urges the Committee summarily to dismiss this request as it is not substantiated in the Applicants' Memorial on Annulment, and they have raised no ground under Article 52(1) in connection with the allocation of costs.430\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6214; Rej., \u00b6278.\n\n359.\n\nAt the Hearing, in response to the request for clarification from the Committee, the Respondent pointed out that the earlier practice of not ordering costs has evolved recently and annulment committees tend to apply the principle that costs follow the event.431 Furthermore, the Respondent submits that as a matter of policy, applying this principle in a case of a frivolous application for annulment, will send the right message to the participants in the system of investment treaty arbitration.432\n\nHr. Tr. 171:23-172:9.\n\nHr. Tr. 172:10-18.\n\n360.\n\nSecond, the Respondent refers to the Applicants' behavior in this case as a factor supporting that the Applicants should be ordered to bear the costs of the Annulment and recall that the Hearing had to be suspended because of lack of payment.433 The Applicants' behavior also necessitated analyzing how to obtain an order on costs in favor of the Czech Republic even if the Committee did not render a decision on the application.434\n\nHr. Tr. 172:19-24.\n\nHr. Tr. 172:25-173:10.\n\n361.\n\nThird, as to the allocation, the Respondent argues that the Committee should assess costs on the basis of what happened in the Annulment Proceedings, and that costs follow the event, and not somehow take into account the decision on costs made by the Tribunal in the Arbitration.435\n\nHr. Tr. 172:11-173:1.\n\n362.\n\nThus, the Respondent submits that the Applicants should bear all of the Respondent's costs and expenses of these proceedings totaling EUR 307,696.51 and CZK 151,881.00.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision on Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nFirst, the Committee notes that at the Hearing, the Applicants unambiguously confirmed that they did not seek annulment specifically in relation to the cost order contained in the Award. Insofar as the Applicants did seek annulment of the cost order contained in the Award as a corollary of the annulment grounds submitted in relation to the merits decision contained in the Award,436 the Applicants' request has become moot because the Committee has found no basis to annul the Award.\n\n\"That's why we submit that also the decisions on costs should be annulled, if the Committee would annul part of the Award as a whole.\" See Tr. 151:11-13.\n\n364.\n\nAs regards the allocation of the costs of the Annulment proceeding. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n365.\n\nThis provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of Arbitration Rule 53), gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the proceeding, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as the Committee deems appropriate.\n\n366.\n\nIn addition, in this case, the BIT contains a specific provision dealing with the allocation of costs in Article 9(2)(d), providing that\n\n*Each party to the dispute shall bear the costs of its own member of the tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the costs of the chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by both parties to the dispute. The tribunal may, however, in its award decide on a different proportion of costs to be borne by the parties and this award shall be binding on both parties.*\n\n367.\n\nBoth Parties have submitted that in this case a suitable approach would be that costs follow the event, i.e., that the successful party is awarded some or all costs. As the Applicants have submitted, this is a well-established principle, which the Respondent has submitted is an increasingly common approach also in investment arbitration. In their submissions, the Parties have not made a distinction between the costs of the Annulment proceeding and legal fees, but have advocated for the same approach to both components of the costs.\n\n368.\n\nIn their submissions, the Parties have not explicitly considered the implications of the guidance provided in Article 9(2)(d) of the BIT. Although the terminology of this provision does not fully correspond to the ICSID procedure in either arbitration or annulment, and grants the tribunal discretion to decide otherwise, the BIT suggests as a general allocation that costs shall be borne by both Parties.\n\n369.\n\nBoth the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the specific provision of the BIT allow the tribunal or committee considerable discretion to allocate costs. The Committee is mindful of the increasing practise of allocating at least certain costs to the successful party, an approach advocated by both Parties. At the same time, the Committee is mindful of the fact that while ultimately all annulment grounds were rejected, the Application was not frivolous, and Article 9(2)(d) of the BIT lays down a general rule that costs shall be shared equally by the Parties. In considering the totality of the circumstances, the Committee seeks a balance between the rule that costs follow the event, and the notion that costs shall be borne equally by the Parties. Consequently, the Committee determines that an appropriate allocation of the costs of the Annulment proceeding entails that the Applicants shall bear the costs of the Annulment consisting of the fees and expenses of the Committee and ICSID, and that each Party shall bear its own legal costs.\n\n370.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nCommittee Members' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Jacomijn J. Van Haersolte-Van Hof | 72,744.78 |\n| Yoshimi Ohara | 62,413.77 |\n| David Pawlak | 75,882.31 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 136,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 28,953.66 |\n| **Total** | **375,994.52** |\n\n371.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicants pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 15(5).437\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicants.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n372.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the *ad hoc* Committee decides unanimously as follows:\n\n(1) The Application is rejected; and\n\n(2) The Applicants shall bear all costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, and each Party shall bear its own legal costs.\n\nDate: March 6, 2025"}]}
