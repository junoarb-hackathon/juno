INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis challenge arises in an arbitration between Nord Stream 2 AG (the **\"Claimant\",** or **\"NSP2AG\")** and the European Union (the **\"Respondent\",** and together with the Claimant, the **\"Parties\")** under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 15 December 1976 (the **\"UNCITRAL Rules\"****)** pursuant to Article 26 of **the** Energy Charter Treaty (the **\"ECT\").** The dispute relates to, among other matters, the Respondent\u2019s enactment of Directive (EU) 2019/692, amending Directive 2009/73/EC of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas. According to the Claimant, the new directive adversely affected its investments in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, an offshore import pipeline that will transmit natural gas from Ust-Luga, Russia to Lubmin, Germany. The Claimant contends that the new directive and the Respondent\u2019s actions in connection with the new directive amount to a breach of Articles 10(1), 10(7), and 13 of the ECT.\n\n2.\n\nThis decision concerns a challenge brought by the Respondent against Mr. Peter Rees QC who was appointed as arbitrator by the Claimant. The Respondent claims that, although Mr. Rees has no direct financial interest in the Claimant, he has a financial interest in Royal Dutch Shell Plc **(\"Shell\"),** a financing partner of the Claimant on the project that forms part of the subject matter of this arbitration. Further, the Respondent cites Mr. Rees\u2019 former employment as Shell\u2019s Legal Director and member of its Executive Committee. For the Respondent, these circumstances give rise to justifiable doubts as to Mr. Rees\u2019 impartiality or independence to act as an arbitrator in this arbitration.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n3.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 26 September 2019 (the **\"Notice of Arbitration\"),** the Claimant commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent pursuant to Article 26(4)(b) of the ECT. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant appointed Mr. Rees as arbitrator.1\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 64.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 4 October 2019 addressed to Mr. Rees (the **\"Request for Disclosure\"), the** Respondent acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Arbitration and requested that Mr. Rees disclose certain specific information as well as \"any other circumstances likely to give rise to doubts as to [his] impartiality or independence.\"2 The Request for Disclosure reads in relevant part::\n\nThe European Union is concerned that, according to information publicly available, there are circumstances that may be a source of a conflict of interests and give rise to doubts as to your impartiality or independence. In particular, it appears that, between 2011 and 2014 you were both legal director and member of the executive committee of Royal Dutch Shell plc and that, both before and after that period, you have provided legal advice to entities in the gas sector.\n\nTherefore, the European Union sends to you this request for disclosure. In particular, but not exhaustively, the European Union would like to know:\n\n1. Whether you have, at present, any links - institutional, financial or other - Royal Dutch Shell plc or any other entities affiliated thereto;\n\n2. Whether you have, at present, any links - institutional, financial or other - to any other shareholder or financing partner of NSP2AG;\n\n3. Whether you were involved in any discussions or negotiations relating to the Nord Stream. 2 project when being legal director and member of the executive committee of Royal Dutch Shell plc, including preparatory discussions prior to the start of the Nord Stream 2 project;\n\n4. Whether you have provided advice, legal or other, to NSP2AG or entities involved in the Nord Stream 2 project;\n\n5. Whether you have provided advice, legal or other, to any of the shareholders or financing partners of NSP2AG, including prior to the start of the Nord [S]tream 2 project;\n\n6. Any other circumstances likely to give rise to doubts as to your impartiality or independence.\n\n[...] The European Union hereby reserves the right to file a notice of challenge in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules.3\n\nRequest for Disclosure, p. 2.\n\nRequest for Disclosure, pp. 1 -2.\n\n5.\n\nBy e-mail of 4 October 2019. Mr. Rees replied to the Respondent's Request for Disclosure and declared his impartiality and independence. The full text of Mr. Rees\u2019 disclosure is reproduced below.4\n\nSee para. 25 below.\n\n6.\n\nOn 10 October 2019, the Respondent served its Notice of Challenge of Mr. Peter Rees as Arbitrator (the **\"Challenge\"),** and invited the Claimant to agree to the challenge or agree on the arrangements for deciding the challenge.\n\n7.\n\nBy e-mail of 11 October 2019, the Claimant indicated that it did not agree to the Respondent\u2019s challenge, and proposed \"to designate the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration as the appointing authority for the purposes of this arbitration, to decide on the EU\u2019s challenge and to fulfil all other roles of the appointing authority under the UNCITRAL Rules as necessary.\"\n\n8.\n\nOn 24 October 2019, the Respondent submitted its Response to Nord Stream 2 AG\u2019s Notice of Arbitration, in which it designated Professor Philippe Sands as arbitrator and agreed with the Claimant\u2019s proposal that the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the **\"PCA\")** act as appointing authority.\n\n9.\n\nOn 29 October 2019, the Claimant wrote to the Secretary-General of the PCA to request that he act as appointing authority and decide the Respondent\u2019s challenge.\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 October 2019, the Claimant provided its Response to the Respondent\u2019s Notice of Challenge of Mr. Peter Rees QC as Arbitrator (the **\"Response\").**\n\n11.\n\nOn 4 November 2019, the Claimant submitted a Reply to the EU\u2019s Response to the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nOn 6 November 2019, Mr. Rees submitted his comments on the Respondent\u2019s Notice of Challenge **(\"Mr. Rees\u2019 Comments\").**\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 November 2019, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant\u2019s response (the **\"Reply\").**\n\n14.\n\nOn 28 November 2019, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent\u2019s reply (the **\"Rejoinder\").**\n\n**III. SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s challenge focuses on Mr. Rees\u2019 past and present connections with Shell, and in turn Shell\u2019s connections with the Claimant and the Nord Stream 2 project that forms part of the subject matter of the dispute. It contends that these connections amount to circumstances giving rise to justifiable doubts as to Mr. Rees\u2019 impartiality or independence as arbitrator in accordance with Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.5 The Claimant maintains that the challenge is without foundation and must therefore be rejected.6\n\nChallenge, paras 4-5; Reply, paras 3-4.\n\nResponse, para. 2.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Comments*\n---------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent submits that any reasonably well-informed person would consider that there are objectively justifiable doubts as to Mr. Rees\u2019 impartiality and independence in the present case given his role as Shell\u2019s Legal Director and as a member of its Executive Committee between 2011 and 2014.7\n\nChallenge, paras 29, 36; Reply, paras 3-4.\n\n17.\n\nFirst, the Respondent refers to Mr. Rees\u2019 disclosure that he will receive a pension from Shell of [REDACTED] he holds [REDACTED] shares Shell [REDACTED] as a result of compulsory share purchase schemes during his service.8 It submits that the shareholding would amount to a significant financial interest in the eyes of any objective, reasonably well-informed person, and that the relative size of that shareholding in relation to Shell\u2019s entire share capital is irrelevant.9 It argues that Mr. Rees\u2019 financial interest would fall within one of the red lists of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (the **\"IBA Guidelines\"),** since the outcome of this dispute may have a significant impact on the value of Shell\u2019s shares and therefore \"Mr. Rees would stand to make a significant financial win or loss depending on how this dispute is decided by a Tribunal of which he would be a member.\"10\n\nChallenge, para. 27; Reply, para. 13.\n\nChallenge, para. 6; Reply, paras 13, 16-18.\n\nChallenge, paras 31-35.\n\n18.\n\nSecond, the Respondent refers to Mr. Rees\u2019 role as Shell\u2019s Legal Director and a member of its Executive Committee between 2011 and 2014, and submits that such period coincided with: (i) increased cooperation between Shell and Gazprom in relation to hydrocarbons; and (ii) Gazprom\u2019s planning and feasibility studies for Nord Stream 2.11 It refers to the 2015 Shareholders Agreement concluded between Shell and Gazprom in relation to Nord Stream 2 and contends that, while this occurred after Mr. Rees left Shell, no reasonably well-informed objective observer would consider it credible that an agreement on such an important and high value strategic project would not be planned and discussed well ahead of the actual signing date.12 On this basis, the Respondent submits that there is at least an appearance that Mr. Rees advised Shell with regard to matters relating to Nord Stream 2, especially in light of his comment that in his role he had \"ultimate responsibility for the Shell global legal function and advise[d] the Shell group management of all legal matters of group-wide importance\", and was \"right in the middle of the business-making decisions which will be shaping the future of the company\".13 It further contends that, in light of toe Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations claim, there is a risk that Mr. Rees\u2019 actions (or inaction) during his time at Shell could influence how he might be inclined to decide the dispute given his connection to the company during a key period.14\n\nChallenge, paras 6-20, 36-38; Reply, paras 30-44. *See* \"Chronology of cooperation between Shell/Gazprom, the Nord Stream 2 project and Mr. Rees\u2019 employment\".

Argentina* on the basis that: (i)that decision applies a higher standard than that set out in Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules; (ii) the connections between Mr. Rees and Shell are more direct than those in the *Suez* case; and (iii) Shell has a strategic interest in Nord Stream 2, which is more than a simple financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.15\n\nReply, paras 47-53, referring to Exhibit CL-10, *Suez and Others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, 12 May 2008 (\"***Suez v. Argentina**\").*\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Comments*\n-------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn maintaining that toe challenge is without foundation, the Claimant contends that none of toe circumstances alleged by the Respondent give rise to justifiable doubts as to Mr. Rees\u2019 impartiality or independence as an arbitrator and that the Respondent misrepresents or overstates the importance of relevant facts.16\n\nResponse, paras 3-4, 6; Rejoinder, paras 1.3-1.5.\n\n21.\n\nFirst, the Claimant argues that the Respondent overstates the significance of Mr. Rees\u2019 shareholding in Shell and the importance of the Nord Stream 2 project to the company.17 It contends that Mr. Rees\u2019 shareholding represents [REDACTED] of Shell\u2019s issued share capital, which renders Mr. Rees\u2019 shareholding immaterial.18 The Claimant adds that Shell\u2019s \u20ac950 million commitment as lender to the Nord Stream 2 project amounts to only 0.3% of Shell\u2019s resources, and therefore the outcome of this arbitration \"will not have a material impact on Shell, and certainly not on the value of Mr. Rees\u2019 shareholding in Shell.\"19\n\nResponse, para. 4.\n\nResponse, paras 4(i), 10, 38(iv), 50, 65; Rejoinder, para. 3.2. *See* Exhibit C-13.\n\nResponse, paras 4(ii), 12, 38(iii), 65; Rejoinder, paras 3.2-3.6. *See* Exhibits C-13, C-14.\n\n22.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that the Respondent likewise overstates Shell\u2019s involvement in the Nord Stream 2 project during the period of Mr. Rees\u2019 employment at the company. According to the Claimant, Shell was not involved, directly or indirectly, in the initial feasibility studies or other preliminary works relating to the Nord Stream 2 project.20 Rather, the Claimant contends that such preliminary work was being undertaken by Nord Stream AG, the developer and operator of the existing Nord Stream pipeline,21 and that responsibility for the project was only transferred to NSP2AG following its incorporation in 2015*.*22 The Claimant submits that: (i)NSP2AG\u2019s involvement began after Mr. Rees had left Shell in February 2014.23 (ii) that negotiations for the 2015 Shareholders Agreement and Shell\u2019s financing agreements with NSP2AG began more than one and three years respectively following his departure from the company;24 and (iii) that Mr. Rees\u2019 recollections in this regard should be taken at face value.25\n\nResponse, paras 17-19, 23, 62; Rejoinder, paras 5.1-5.2.\n\nResponse, paras 17, 60.\n\nResponse, paras 20, 23. *See* Exhibit C-2.\n\nResponse, para. 61; Rejoinder, paras 5.5, 5.10-5.12.\n\nResponse, paras 22(i), 24, 38(vi). *See* Exhibit C-17.\n\nRejoinder, paras 5.6-5.7.\n\n23.\n\nWith respect to Shell\u2019s relationship with the Claimant, the Claimant denies that Shell was ever one of its shareholders given that the Shareholders Agreement never materialized;26 nor is Shell an affiliate of the Claimant27 As regards Shell\u2019s relationship with Gazprom, the Claimant points out that a careful perusal of all the press releases from Gazprom\u2019s website would reveal that \"Shell is just one of a number of major gas companies with which Gazprom has dealings\",28 and that there is no basis to assert that any discussions between Shell and Gazprom unrelated to the Nord Stream 2 project would give rise to justifiable doubts as to Mr. Rees\u2019 impartiality or independence.29 The Claimant adds that \"[s]uch negotiations and arms-length cooperation are common in the energy industry, where the capital intensive nature of the investments often leads to the major companies cooperating in their development.\"30\n\nResponse, paras 21, 22(ii), 38(ii), 63.\n\nResponse, paras 48, 54, 56, 59, 65; Rejoinder, paras 3.7-3.14.\n\nResponse, para. 6(iv). *See* paras. 25-30; Exhibit C-16.\n\nRejoinder, para. 5.13.\n\nResponse, para. 6(iv).\n\n24.\n\nFinally, the Claimant cites *Suez* v. *Argentina* as authority in support of its contention that challenges concerning immaterial shareholdings, as it contends Mr. Rees has in Shell, have been previously rejected.31\n\nResponse, paras 40-42; Rejoinder, 4.1-4.4.\n\n*Mr. Rees\u2019 Comments*\n--------------------\n\n25.\n\nMr. Rees refers to his initial disclosure in the present case, which reads, in relevant part:\n\n1. I have no links with Royal Dutch Shell plc (\"Shell\"), or any entities affiliated thereto, save for the following:\n\n(i) [REDACTED] I will receive a small pension from Shell as a result of my 3/4 years\u2019 service [REDACTED]\n\n(ii) I have some shares in Shell as a result of compulsory share purchase schemes during my 3\u00bc service [REDACTED]\n\n2. I have no links with any other shareholder or financing partner of NSP2AG[\u2026]\n\n3. To the best of my recollection I was not involved in any discussions or negotiations (including preparatory discussions) relating to the Nord Stream 2 project when I was at Shell.\n\n4. I have not provided any advice at any time to any of the shareholders or financing partners of NSP2AG or entities involved in the Nord Stream 2 project.\n\n5. I have not provided any advice at any time to any of the shareholders or financing partners of NSP2AG, including prior to the start of the Nord Stream 2 project (save obviously to Shell (not in relation to the Nord Stream 2 project) when I was Legal Director). [...]\n\n26.\n\nMr. Rees asserts that his shareholding is insignificant and does not affect his impartiality or independence in this case,32 and that he would not have accepted the appointment had he considered that the outcome of this case could have an impact on Shell\u2019s share price.33\n\nMr. Rees\u2019 Comments, paras 4-5.\n\nMr. Rees\u2019 Comments, para. 7.\n\n27.\n\nHe further acknowledges that in his capacity as an Executive Committee Member he was informed that Shell had signed a cooperation agreement with Gazprom, but states that he was not involved in advising upon or negotiating the agreement and that he never met any officials or lawyers from Gazprom.34 He further states that he has never provided legal advice to Shell on the Nord Stream 2 project,35 and that he has no reason to doubt the Claimant's statement that Shell\u2019s involvement in Nord Stream 2 began only after he left Shell.36\n\nMr. Rees\u2019 Comments, para. 9.\n\nMr. Rees\u2019 Comments, para. 8.\n\nMr. Rees\u2019 Comments, para. 6.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n28.\n\nIn evaluating this challenge, I have considered all the comments of the Parties and those of Mr. Rees. However, in ruling on the challenge, I address only the issues that I consider necessary to arrive at my decision.\n\n29.\n\nThe Parties agree that the UNCITRAL Rules 1976 apply to this matter.37 Accordingly, the standard by which the Respondent\u2019s challenge must be assessed is that contained in Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules:\n\nAny arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence.\n\nChallenge, paras. 5, 28; Response, para. 31; Reply, para. 8; Rejoinder, para. 1.2.\n\n30.\n\nThe Parties acknowledge that this standard is an objective one.38 This means that, while the perspective of the challenging party is part of the context of the challenge, it is not decisive. Rather, the doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence must be justifiable pursuant to an analysis of all relevant circumstances from the perspective of an objective, reasonable, and informed third party.39 Further, a challenge may succeed on the basis of an appearance of bias without requiring proof of actual bias.40\n\nChallenge, para. 29; Response, para. 32.\n\n*Vito G. Gallo v. Government of Canada,* NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Decision on the Challenge to Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, QC, 14 October 2003, para. 19; Challenge Decision of 11 January 1995, XXII Yearbook Commercial Arbitration 227, 234 (1997), para. 24; Exhibit RL-1.\n\n*Country X* v. *Company Q,* Challenge Decision, UNCITRAL, 11 January 1995, (1997) 22 YCA 234, paras 23-24; *National Grid Plc.* v. *Republic of Argentina,* Decision on the Challenge to Mr. Judd L. Kessler, LCIA Case No. UN 7949, 3 December 2007, paras 80-87; *Merck Sharp & Dohme (I.A.) Corporation v. The Republic of Ecuador,* PCA Case No. 2012-10, Decision on Challenge to Arbitrator Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, 12 April 2012, para. 53.\n\n31.\n\nThe basis of the Respondent\u2019s challenge to Mr. Rees is his current and prior connections with Shell, an investor in the Nord Stream 2 project. In order to determine whether such relationship might meet the test in Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, it is first necessary to consider the extent of Shell\u2019s relationship with the Claimant, NSP2AG, and the Nord Stream 2 project. It is clear from the materials presented by the Parties that Shell has a significant financial interest in the Claimant, having made an investment of \u20ac950 million in the Nord Stream 2 project. While such an amount might seem small when considered in light of the totality of Shell\u2019s resources, it cannot be said that an investment of almost \u20ac1 billion is insignificant when considered from an objective standpoint. It is also clear that Shell itself considers its investment in this project significant, given that it listed the project as one of its \"key portfolio events\" in its 2017 Annual Report.41 In this light, a relationship with Shell on the part of an arbitrator could give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence in a dispute involving the Nord Stream 2 project in the eyes of an objective, reasonable, and informed third party.\n\nExhibit R-28.\n\n32.\n\nThe question that follows is whether Mr. Rees\u2019 connections with Shell are sufficient to give rise to such doubts. First, Mr. Rees was the Legal Director of Shell and a member of its Executive Committee between January 2011 and February 2014, and in his own words was \"right in the middle of the business-making decisions which will be shaping the future of the company\".42 Even if I accept that Mr. Rees did not provide legal advice regarding the Nord Stream 2 project, in my view it would be reasonable to consider that the Nord Stream 2 project was a matter being discussed at Shell and considered by its Executive Committee at that time. In this regard, it is significant that: (i) Shell and Gazprom were actively discussing joint opportunities for further hydrocarbons distribution in Russia and Europe; (ii) this was occurring at the same time that the feasibility assessments and initial studies for Nord Stream 2 were being carried out; (iii) Gazprom furthered its relationships vis-\u00e0-vis the Nord Stream 2 project with two other future investors, BASF and GDF SUEZ (later ENGIE), at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2013;43 and (iv) at that same event, Shell and Gazprom met to discuss further strategic cooperation. While Shell\u2019s formal involvement in Nord Stream 2 began with the 2015 Shareholders Agreement, a shareholders agreement for such an important project would necessarily be planned and discussed well ahead of the signing of the agreement.44 I therefore find that justifiable doubts for an objective, reasonable, and informed third party would arise from the proximity in time of Mr. Rees\u2019 tenure on Shell\u2019s Executive Committee and the Nord Stream 2 project.\n\nExhibit R-20.\n\nRejoinder, Appendix 1, p. 19; Exhibit R-13.\n\nReply, para. 34.\n\n33.\n\nSecond, Mr. Rees has ongoing financial connections with Shell by way of his pension and shareholding,[REDACTED] The Parties have commented at length regarding the size of the shareholding relative to the company\u2019s entire share capital, and whether the outcome of the present dispute will impact Shell\u2019s share price so as to alter its value. However, in my view it is not necessary to establish a direct connection between the outcome of the dispute and Shell\u2019s share price. Rather, what is relevant is that Mr. Rees has a valuable shareholding in Shell, and that an objective, reasonable, and informed third party would consider that significant in a dispute involving Shell\u2019s strategic interests such as those in the present case. In any event, the doubts as to Mr. Rees\u2019 impartiality and independence in the present case are not limited to his financial connection, but are to be considered together with his previous role at Shell as discussed above.\n\n34.\n\nI wish to emphasise that I have found no reason to impugn Mr. Rees\u2019 professional integrity, nor have I found any proof of an actual lack of independence or impartiality on his part. Nevertheless, I consider that, from the perspective of an objective, reasonable, and informed third party, Mr. Rees\u2019 previous and present connections with Shell, taken together, give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality and independence in the present arbitration under Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s challenge should be upheld.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n[35].\n\n**NOW THEREFORE,** I, Hugo H. Siblesz, Secretary General of the PCA, after having established to my satisfaction my competence to decide this challenge in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, and having considered the comments of the Parties and of Mr. Rees;\n\n**HEREBY UPHOLD** the challenge brought by the Respondent against Mr. Peter Rees QC."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Decision on Request for Preliminary Phase on Jurisdiction)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2020-12-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Decision on Request for Preliminary Phase on Jurisdiction)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 26 September 2019 (the \"**Notice of Arbitration**\"), the Claimant commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent pursuant to Article 26(4)(b) of the Energy Charter Treaty (the \"**ECT**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 24 October 2019, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 5 March 2020, the Tribunal circulated Draft Procedural Order No. 1 and invited the Parties to submit their comments thereon.\n\n4.\n\nBy letters dated 20 March 2020, the Parties submitted their respective comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 1. In particular, the Claimant proposed a bifurcation of the proceedings consisting of a first phase addressing the merits and the Claimant's request for injunctive relief, to be followed as necessary by a quantum phase. Meanwhile, the Respondent envisaged a trifurcation of the proceedings with a preliminary phase on jurisdiction and admissibility. The Respondent also proposed that the Claimant's request for injunctive relief be postponed to a final phase on remedies, including both injunctive relief and damages.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 27 March 2020, the Tribunal circulated a revised Draft Procedural Order No. 1. The Tribunal noted the proposals for bifurcation and trifurcation, and invited the Parties to revert by 8 April 2020 with their comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 1 as revised.\n\n6.\n\nBy letters dated 8 April 2020, the Parties submitted their further comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 1. For the Respondent, only after the submission of the Parties' respective memorials would the Tribunal be able to properly assess whether to bifurcate or trifurcate the proceedings. On the other hand, the Claimant was of the view that the Parties could proceed directly to an exchange of submissions on the question of bifurcation or trifurcation.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 11 April 2020, the Tribunal decided that it would only rule on the issue of bifurcation or trifurcation after the receipt of the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits and Final Injunction and the Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and, potentially, a hearing on the request for a preliminary phase. The Tribunal invited the Parties to revert by 20 April 2020 with their proposals for the timetable to be adopted in this vein.\n\n8.\n\nBy letters dated 20 April 2020, the Parties made separate proposals regarding the timetable to be adopted.\n\n9.\n\nOn 24 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, including a procedural calendar up to the Tribunal's decision on the bifurcation or trifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n10.\n\nOn 4 May 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 setting out the applicable transparency regime.\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 July 2020, the Claimant submitted its Memorial (the \"**Claimant's Memorial**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 15 September 2020, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Memorial on Jurisdiction**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn 16 October 2020, the Claimant submitted the Claimant's Response to the Respondent's Request for a Preliminary Phase on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (the \"**Response to Preliminary Phase Request**\").\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 4 November 2020, the Tribunal advised the parties that it considered that a videoconference hearing on the Respondent's Request for a Preliminary Phase on Jurisdiction would be useful. The Tribunal invited Parties to revert with their availability for a hearing.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 11 November 2020, the Tribunal scheduled the hearing for 8 December 2020.\n\n16.\n\nThe hearing on the Respondent's Request for a Preliminary Phase on Jurisdiction was held by videoconference on 8 December 2020.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent notes that \"[t]he Claimant [...] has engaged in a campaign of litigation in respect of the same dispute in multiple jurisdictions.\"1 The Respondent recounts that, on 25 July 2019, prior to the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant filed an application for annulment of Directive (EU) 2019/692 (the \"**Amending Directive**\") before the General Court of the European Union (the \"**General Court**\").2 On 20 May 2020, the General Court issued an order declaring the application inadmissible.3 The Claimant appealed that decision before the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\").4 Moreover, the Respondent points out that, on 15 June 2020, the Claimant separately filed an appeal against an adverse decision by the German Bundesnetzagentur concerning the Amending Directive.5 The Respondent asserts that both appeals are still pending.6\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 14.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 12, *referring to* Action brought on 25 July 2019 \u2014 *Nord Stream 2 v.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the fork-in-the-road clause is triggered only when the dispute submitted under Article 26(2)(a) or (2)(b) is one \"which concern[s] an alleged breach of an obligation of [the EU] under Part III\".29 In this regard, the Claimant denies submitting the present dispute to another forum such as to vitiate the Respondent's consent to international arbitration under Article 26(3) of the ECT.30\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 30; Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 36:14-37:18, 51:17-23, 60:16-62:4; The Energy Charter Treaty, 1994, Articles 26(1) and 26(3)(b)(i), **CLA-1/CL-1**; E.

In addition, the Claimant reserves the right to claim damages.49 Meanwhile, the Claimant reiterates, no damages can be granted in an annulment action before the General Court.50 While an action for damages in the CJEU is possible, this would require a separate claim made on a separate legal basis.51 Hence, the outcome of the action for annulment could not be the same as the outcome of the present arbitration.52\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33(i).\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33(i); Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 52:16-18; TFEU, Article 263, **CLA-42**.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33(ii).\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33(ii).\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33(ii).\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33(ii).\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 33(ii).\n\n29.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant contends that the proceedings before the German courts do not share the same fundamental basis as the present arbitration, for the same reasons that the two actions do not satisfy the triple identity test.53\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 34.\n\n**B. THE** ***RATIONE PERSONAE*** **OBJECTION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIn regard to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae*, the Respondent submits that it is not the party responsible for the alleged breaches of the ECT.54 The Respondent contends that EU directives such as the Amending Directive are addressed to EU Member States only, not individuals, and thus do not impose any legal obligation on the Claimant.55 The Respondent points out that directives are binding only \"as to the result to be achieved\" and leave the choice of form and methods to the national authorities of EU Member States.56\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 123-124; Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 11:3-18, 63:7-11.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 140, 145, 149-153; Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 20:6-19; ECJ judgment of 26 February 1986, *Marshall*, 152/84, EU:C:1986:84, \u00b6 48, **RLA-57**; ECJ order of 7 July 2014, *Group'Hygi\u00e8ne v.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's *ratione personae* argument is fundamentally flawed,66 as it is entirely grounded in the Respondent's own legal order.67 The Claimant argues that by the Respondent's line of reasoning, the latter's actions in connection with an EU directive, however egregious they might be and even if the directive impairs a protected investment under the ECT, could never give rise to a claim against the Respondent under the same treaty.68 The Claimant explains that, as an REIO under the ECT, the Respondent has assumed the same obligations as the State Parties to the ECT as regards matters falling within the scope of the ECT and within the Respondent's competences.69 As such, the Respondent's actions and omissions must be judged against the standards contained in the ECT as a matter of international law, and not EU law.70\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6\u00b6 52, 59.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6\u00b6 52, 61.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 61; Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 32:8-16.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 53.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n\n34.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's view, the Claimant maintains that the Respondent's actions in connection with the Amending Directive, including the proposal for its adoption, the manner in which the Amending Directive was adopted, the results to be achieved, and its ultimate effect, are all attributable to the Respondent.71 Moreover, the Claimant notes that, while EU Member States enjoy discretion in implementing EU directives, the directives are nonetheless binding as to the result to be achieved.72 The European Commission can request the Member State to amend or withdraw a decision granting an exemption if it is in breach of the legal requirements of the Gas Directive and can bring infringement proceedings against the Member States that fail to achieve the result prescribed by an EU directive.73\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 54; Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 42:19-43:7.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 56; Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 32:3-7.\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 175; TFEU, Articles 258, 259, **CLA-42**.\n\n**III. RESPONDENT'S REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY PHASE**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n35.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent submits that, unlike the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules \u2013 which are the version applicable to this dispute \u2013 include a presumption in favour of preliminary consideration of jurisdictional issues.74 Moreover, in the determination of whether a preliminary phase on jurisdiction is appropriate, the Respondent relies on the *Glamis Gold* test75 setting out three criteria for bifurcation, namely that (a) the objection is substantial; (b) the objection to jurisdiction, if granted, would result in a material reduction of the proceedings at the next phase; and (c) bifurcation is not impractical.76 For the Respondent, all three criteria are met in this case.77\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 216; *Mesa Power Group LLC v.

CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the proposition that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules set out a presumption in favour of resolving jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase.90 On the contrary, the Claimant points out that Article 21(4) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules as well as arbitral precedents thereunder recognize the very broad discretion of a tribunal to determine whether to hear jurisdictional objections separately from the merits of the dispute.91 The Claimant likewise asserts that the *Glamis Gold* criteria are non-exhaustive,92 and do not constitute a standalone test.93 For the Claimant, the fundamental principle which should guide a tribunal in exercising its discretion is the \"need to ensure both \u2018procedural justice and efficiency, taking all circumstances into account'\".94 In this case, the Claimant is of the view that bifurcation of one or both of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections from the merits of the dispute would not serve the ends of fairness and procedural efficiency.95 Hence, the Claimant submits that the two objections should be considered together and resolved along with the merits.96\n\nResponse to Preliminary Phase Request \u00b6 12; *Cairn Energy Plc and Cairn UK Holdings Limited v.

TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n45.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal confirms that, at this stage of the proceedings, its task is to determine whether to bifurcate the proceedings as between jurisdiction and liability, and not to decide on the merits of the Respondent's preliminary objections. Nevertheless, in making this determination, the Tribunal must consider the substance of those objections in order to decide whether their early determination is likely to be fair and efficient. In this vein, the Tribunal notes that, while Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules sets forth a presumption in favour of the bifurcation of jurisdictional objections, this presumption is seldom decisive. The Tribunal further considers that the *Glamis Gold* criteria constitute relevant criteria for the assessment of whether bifurcation would be fair and efficient, but these criteria do not constitute a rigid test and are not the only criteria that may be considered by the Tribunal.\n\n46.\n\nWith the foregoing in mind, the Tribunal has carefully considered each of the objections, starting with the Respondent's fork-in-the-road argument on whether the Claimant has already selected a different forum for its dispute.\n\n**A. THE FORK-IN-THE-ROAD OBJECTION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, under Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, it has reserved its consent \"to submit disputes to international arbitration under ECT only to those disputes that have not been submitted to the courts of the European Union\",116 and that this case is \"before no less than three adjudication bodies.\"117 In its submissions, the Respondent rejects the \"triple identity\" test and instead supports a \"fundamental basis\" test which goes to whether the disputes share a \"fundamental cause\" and seek the same outcomes.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b611.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b615.\n\n48.\n\nUnder the fork-in-the-road clause in Article 26 of the ECT, the Tribunal is required to analyse whether the \"dispute\" subject to this arbitration has been already submitted to the European courts. The Tribunal is not convinced that the analysis required to rule on the Respondent's fork-in-the-road objection will be as straightforward as the Respondent argues. Irrespective of the proper test to be applied, the Tribunal does not believe that it could decide the issue at hand by merely comparing the pleas in the proceedings before the General Court and the CJEU with the claims made in this arbitration, without further analysis. Absent such analysis, the Tribunal apprehends the danger that it might apply the fork-in-the road clause in a manner too superficial to give proper effect to the clause. The analysis may also \u2013 to a certain extent at least \u2013 become intertwined with aspects of the merits. Moreover, the Tribunal's ruling may have significant implications as to the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals in future investor-State disputes involving the EU. Consequently, the Tribunal favours a cautious approach in which it can take account of the complete picture of the claims being advanced in this case alongside the arguments brought and remedies sought before the EU courts. The Tribunal would not otherwise be confident that it could decide the objection and realize any efficiency through bifurcation.\n\n**B. THE** ***RATIONAE PERSONAE*** **OBJECTION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the \"EU directives challenged by the Claimant impose no legal obligation on the Claimant.\"118 According to the Respondent, to rule on this objection, the Tribunal would not have to decide whether the alleged \"practical effects\" of the Amending Directive have been proven, but only whether those alleged \"practical effects\", even if they were substantiated by the Claimant, would result necessarily from the Amending Directive or rather from measures of the Member States within their margin of discretion.119 The Respondent elaborates:\n\nThe Claimant's legal situation has been left unmodified by the Amending Directive, which has no \"direct effect\" regarding the Claimant. Consequently, the Amending Directive cannot, as such, breach the ECT. Rather, the alleged breaches of the ECT could only result from the measures which the Member States may or may not take in order to transpose and implement the Gas Directive, as modified by the Amending Directive. As explained below, however, the Member States have a broad margin of discretion when transposing and implementing the relevant provisions of the challenged EU directives. This excludes the international responsibility of the European Union for any alleged breaches of the ECT that result from measures of the Member States within that broad margin of discretion.120\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction heading 2.2.3.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 228; Hearing Transcript, 8 December 2020, 21:22-22:21.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 153.\n\n50.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were persuaded to adopt the Respondent's distinction between deciding on the alleged practical effects of the Amending Directive and the attribution of such practical effects to the enactment by the EU of the Amending Directive itself or to its implementation by EU Member States within their margin of discretion, the Tribunal will, in order to grapple with this objection, need to understand fully the role of the Amending Directive and its relationship with the specific claims brought by the Claimant. While this jurisdictional objection presents a discrete issue different from the issues raised on the merits, the same or similar arguments and facts are likely to be relevant for both the procedural and the substantive determination. Therefore, it is the Tribunal's view that this objection is closely linked to the merits of the dispute, and not apt for bifurcation.\n\n**C. THE SCOPE OF THE NEXT PHASE**\n----------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to make clear that in reaching this view on bifurcation, it has reached no conclusions as to the merits of the preliminary objections, both of which will have to be addressed in the next phase.\n\n52.\n\nThe Parties diverge in their proposals as to the scope of the next phase of the proceedings. In particular, the Respondent objects to the inclusion of the Claimant's request for injunctive relief along with the merits within the scope of the next phase. The Claimant, for its part, asserts that this objection is untimely and should have been raised at the time of the submission of the Claimant's Memorial.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's request to bifurcate injunctive relief into a final phase on remedies was made in its letter dated 20 March 2020, and that the Tribunal has not yet ruled on this question in any of its prior orders. Nevertheless, for the same reasons that the Tribunal decides not to bifurcate jurisdiction from merits, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to include the Claimant's request for injunctive relief along with the merits within the scope of the next phase of these proceedings. The Tribunal thus orders the bifurcation only of a final phase on damages, if any.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n54.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's request for bifurcation and establishes the procedural calendar annexed to this order.\n\n**So ordered by the Tribunal.**"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 9", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2022-09-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 9\n----------------------\n\n**I.

The Tribunal also indicated that, for any further suspension to be granted, the Claimant would be required to provide further information demonstrating a reasonable possibility of resuming the arbitration.

THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent's Request seeks security for costs as an interim measure under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to address the \"risk that the Claimant will not have sufficient funds to reimburse the costs and expenses incurred by the European Union for the purposes of its defence in this arbitration.\"1 The Respondent argues that it has met the criteria in order to justify an interim measure ordering security for costs, namely (i) a *prima facie* case of entitlement to costs,2 (ii) the threat of imminent irreparable harm,3 and (iii) the proportionality of the measure requested.4 The Respondent accordingly seeks an order of security for the costs incurred and to be incurred in these proceedings and in its defence of the Claimant's claims, in the amount of at least EUR 5.65 million.5\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 40.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 48-55.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 56-63.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 64-76.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 79-88.\n\n10.\n\nIn its Response, the Claimant argues that the Request is premature6 and, in addition, that the Respondent has not made out a *prima facie* case on the merits leading to an entitlement of costs.7\n\nResponse, p. 1.\n\nResponse, pp. 2-8.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent acknowledges that it must demonstrate an urgent need for security for costs in the sense that it \"cannot wait for the issuance of the award since it is probable that there will be a not adequately compensated damage if the order for security for costs is not granted.\"8 The Respondent asserts that \"[g]iven the ongoing debt restructuring proceedings and their possible outcomes, the European Union runs a risk of not having its defence costs and administrative fees repaid by the Claimant, should the order for security for costs not be granted by the Tribunal.\"9\n\nRequest, \u00b6 46(ii).\n\nRequest, \u00b6 58.\n\n12.\n\nUnder these circumstances, where the arbitration is suspended, and may not proceed further, the Tribunal does not see that a case has been made for urgency to determine the Request.

Nor is the position of the Respondent as an unsecured, non-privileged creditor, with respect to costs already incurred, likely to change materially before the procedural meeting on 13 October 2022, or between that date and any future orders on the procedure to be followed, including a decision on costs, should the Claimant fail to satisfy the Tribunal of a reasonable possibility of resuming the arbitration.

The Claimant noted that, given these circumstances, until \"that point in time [it] will not be in a position to give any further substantial indication concerning its circumstances, its ability to continue the proceedings, nor on the further conduct of the proceedings, or on timing.\" Accordingly, it requested a continuation of the suspension of the proceedings and a postponement of the 20 June 2022 procedural meeting until a date after 10 September 2022. At the same time, the Claimant undertook to update the Tribunal and the Respondent should circumstances change substantially prior to that date.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 13 June 2022, the Respondent submitted that it would be prejudiced by a suspension of the proceedings, as it would unnecessarily prolong a situation of legal uncertainty and would generate continuing legal costs for the Respondent. The Respondent also submitted that the Claimant had insufficiently explained how the proceedings before the Cantonal Court of Zug resulted in a continued inability of the Claimant to pursue the arbitration. In particular, the Respondent asserted as follows:\n\nAccording to the Claimant's email of 1 March 2022, its inability to pursue the arbitration was the consequence of the U.S. sanctions and \"recent geopolitical developments\". In view of that, and in the absence of any other explanation, the European Union fails to understand how the outcome of the ongoing proceedings before the Cantonal Court of Zug referred to by the Claimant could have any impact on such alleged inability.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy e-mail of 1 March 2022, the Claimant informed the Tribunal as follows:\n\nThe designation of Nord Stream 2 AG as a US Specially Designated National (SDN) on 23 February 2022 and recent geopolitical developments have led to an inability on the part of the Claimant to pursue the arbitration at this time. In particular, the Claimant\u2019s bank accounts have been blocked, meaning NSP2AG is unable to make any payments or access finance.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant consequently requested a suspension of the arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 7 March 2022, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to provide a more complete description of its current circumstances, and opposed the Claimant\u2019s request for a suspension, except under certain conditions.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 14 March 2022, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that its external counsel no longer represented it and reiterated its request for a suspension of the arbitration until 1 September 2022, proposing to update the Tribunal in three months as to its ability to continue the proceedings.\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 March 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, suspending the arbitration and scheduling a procedural meeting for 20 June 2022 at which the Claimant would be invited to update the Tribunal on its circumstances and ability to continue the proceedings.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 8 June 2022, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had been granted a provisional composition moratorium until 10 September 2022 by the Cantonal Court in Zug, by which date the Cantonal Court would decide on a definitive composition moratorium, an extension of the provisional composition moratorium, or a declaration of bankruptcy. The Claimant noted that, given these circumstances, until \"that point in time [it] will not be in a position to give any further substantial indication concerning its circumstances, its ability to continue the proceedings, nor on the further conduct of the proceedings, or on timing.\" Accordingly, it requested a continuation of the suspension of the proceedings and a postponement of the 20 June 2022 procedural meeting until a date after 10 September 2022. At the same time, the Claimant undertook to update the Tribunal and the Respondent should circumstances change substantially prior to that date.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 13 June 2022, the Respondent submitted that it would be prejudiced by a suspension of the proceedings, as it would unnecessarily prolong a situation of legal uncertainty and would generate continuing legal costs for the Respondent. The Respondent also submitted that the Claimant had insufficiently explained how the proceedings before the Cantonal Court of Zug resulted in a continued inability of the Claimant to pursue the arbitration. In particular, the Respondent asserted as follows:\n\nAccording to the Claimant\u2019s email of 1 March 2022, its inability to pursue the arbitration was the consequence of the U.S. sanctions and \"recent geopolitical developments\". In view of that, and in the absence of any other explanation, the European Union fails to understand how the outcome of the ongoing proceedings before the Cantonal Court of Zug referred to by the Claimant could have any impact on such alleged inability.

The Respondent submits that the continuation of the arbitration proceeding has become \"impossible\", because the Claimant has failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of resuming this arbitration, and \"unnecessary\", because the proceedings have become moot, within the meaning of Article 34(2).2 Article 34(2) states:\n\nIf, before the award is made, the continuation of the arbitral proceedings becomes unnecessary or impossible for any reason not mentioned in paragraph 1, the arbitral tribunal shall inform the parties of its intention to issue an order for the termination of the proceedings. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to issue such an order unless a party raises justifiable grounds for objection.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, paras. 2, 9.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the continuation of the present proceeding causes it prejudice, because it prolongs unnecessarily a situation of legal uncertainty and it generates continuing legal costs for the Respondent that the Respondent might not be able to recover.3 In contrast, termination of this proceeding would not have any irreversible consequences for the Claimant as it could bring fresh proceedings at a later stage.4\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 5.\n\n36.\n\nOn the impossibility limb of Article 34(2), the Respondent argues that the continuation of the proceedings has become impossible because the Claimant lacks the necessary funds to continue the proceedings until its completion, and if necessary, to reimburse the Respondent the costs awarded by the Tribunal.5 It submits that the proceedings must be terminated \"unless the Claimant provides adequate security for costs\", which it has not done.6 The Respondent submits that insolvency is an event that frequently triggers termination of an arbitration.7 It adds that arbitration proceedings have been terminated in circumstances in which a claimant failed to comply with an order of security for costs.8\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023, para. 7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 86.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 11, *citing* David Caron and Lee Caplan, *The UNCITRAL arbitration rules: a commentary (with an integrated and comparative discussion of the 2010 and 1976 UNCITRAL arbitration rules),* Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 571.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023, paras. 13-15.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 34(2) does not require that the Claimant is impecunious to continue the arbitration; rather, \"what must be shown is that it is not reasonably 'possible\u2019 for the Claimant to *complete* the arbitration and comply with the Tribunal\u2019s awards\".9 The Respondent submits that the Claimant, \"[a]t best [...] has shown that it can resume the arbitration now and take the immediate next procedural steps\", but the Claimant \"has not demonstrated a 'reasonable possibility\u2019 that it can *complete* the arbitration\".10 The Respondent argues that the Claimant is \"wholly dependent\" on third-party funders to pay its current expenses and there is \"simply no guarantee that that third party will continue to provide the necessary funds until the completion of the ar bitration\".11\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023, para. 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023, para. 12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023. para. 8.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it has made out a *prima facie* case that it is not reasonably possible for the Claimant to complete the arbitration. The Respondent argues that the burden of proof then shifts to the Claimant, and the Claimant failed to meet its burden.12 It has failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of resuming the arbitration and refused to disclose highly relevant financial information.13\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023. para. 17.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023. para. 18.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the [REDACTED] to fund the litigation is \"not an adequate financial instrument to guarantee that the Claimant will be able to cover all the costs related to this arbitration.14 [REDACTED].15 [REDACTED].16 [REDACTED]:17\n\n(i) [REDACTED]\n\n(ii) [REDACTED]\n\n(iii) [REDACTED]\n\n(iv) [REDACTED]\n\n(v) [REDACTED]\n\n(vi) [REDACTED]\n\n(vii) [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. paras. 21-22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. paras. 23-28.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 30, *referring to* Financial (accounting) reporting according to the Federal Tax Service and Rosstat.

Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 88.\n\n44.\n\nFirst, the Claimant would be effectively unable to operate the NS2 Pipeline as a result of United States **(\"US\")** sanctions, which would remain in place for the foreseeable future.26 The Respondent points out that the primary sanctions, particularly the Specially Designated National **(\"SDN\")** designation of the Claimant, will continue to have a major impact on the Claimant\u2019s ability to conduct business because the blocking sanctions prevent US companies and individuals from transacting with the Claimant.27 and because the SDN designation prohibits US financial institutions that process fluids transfers in an intermediary or correspondent banking capacity from conducting any transaction in which the Claimant has an interest, unless authorized.28 Even non-US financial institutions may choose to refrain from transacting with the Claimant due to reputational concerns and concerns of running afoul of US prohibitions.29 In addition, the Respondent submits that non-US entities would also avoid dealing with the Claimant for fear of being caught by US secondary sanctions.30\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 3 October 2022, paras. 28-29; Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, paras. 89, 94, 132.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. paras. 110-111, 114.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 112.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 113.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 116.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the US sanctions have already had a \"paralysing impact\" on the Claimant\u2019s activities, evidenced by the \"triggering of the Claimant\u2019s insolvency\", thereby forcing the Claimant to suspend the current arbitration.31 The Swiss authorities had also noted that the Claimant faced massive payment difficulties that rendered its ongoing operations impossible, leading to the Claimant being placed under a composition moratorium.32 In addition, the Respondent notes that within a few days of its SDN designation, the Claimant was forced to terminate its contracts with most of its employees and abandon its premises in Zug.33 Further, the Claimant has been unable to take any further action in order to meet the conditions imposed by the German regulatory authority for resuming the process of certification pursuant to the Gas Directive.34 The [REDACTED] have abandoned their investments.35 The Respondent also submits that the operation of NS2 Pipeline demands considerable human and economic resources, and cannot be accomplished with just a skeleton staff and without ready access to finance or financial services.36 In addition, the Respondent highlights the delay of more than eight months taken by the Claimant to procure [REDACTED] and the inability of the Claimant to procure the funds from any reputable and solvent financial institution.37\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. paras. 96. 119-121.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 122.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 123.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 124.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 125.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 129.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 131.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that the Claimant itself, as well as its witness [REDACTED] and its expert [REDACTED], have submitted that the threat of US sanctions had complicated or prevented either the renegotiation of financing agreements or the sale of the NS2 Pipeline. According to the Respondent, the Claimant had also previously described the sanctions as having extraterritorial effects, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s most recent submission.38 Thus, it is \"manifestly misleading and disingenuous\" for the Claimant to claim that the sanctions had a very limited impact.39\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 127.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 96.\n\n47.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s claim that no US secondary sanctions have been imposed since February 2022, the Respondent rebuts that it was due to a lack of material actionable activities being conducted. Should the Claimant seek to repair and operate the NS2 Pipeline, the Respondent submits that there is little doubt that the US authorities will respond with sanctions.40\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 128.\n\n48.\n\nSecond, the recent act of sabotage against the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines might prevent the Claimant from operating the NS2 Pipeline.41 The Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s submission that the NS2 Pipeline is partially functioning and may be repaired is merely \"speculations\".42 Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s position, the Respondent cites the German authorities, which have stated that the NS2 Pipeline may not be repairable, and press reports that assess the damage to be significant.43 Regardless, the Respondent points out that the reparation would face obstacles due to US sanctions, the need for permission from the Danish government since it would be carried out in the Danish territorial waters, and difficulty in obtaining insurance.44\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 3 October 2022, para. 31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, paras. 134-135.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 136.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, paras. 137-138.\n\n49.\n\nThird, operation of the NS2 Pipeline would be commercially unfeasible, due to the current behaviour of the Russian Federation, Gazprom, and the Claimant that has eroded customers\u2019 trust and caused them to seek out alternative suppliers.45\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, paras. 140-144.\n\n50.\n\nFourth, there are clear indications that the Claimant would in any event be unwilling to operate the NS2 Pipeline, because the Russian Federation has deliberately chosen to \"weaponise\" its supplies of natural gas to the European Union and has stopped or severely limited its supplies.46 The Respondent points to Gazprom\u2019s decision to restrict and eventually stop gas supplies through the Nord Stream 1 Pipeline since June 2022, although it had been accorded a derogation pursuant to Article 49a of the Gas Directive.47 Moreover, since the invasion of Ukraine, the Claimant has taken no further action in order to meet the conditions imposed by the German regulatory authority for resuming the process of certification of the Claimant.48\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 3 October 2022, paras. 38-44.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 145.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 3 October 2022, para. 45; Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 147.\n\n51.\n\nFifth, in the current circumstances and for the foreseeable future, even if the Claimant were allowed to apply for a derogation pursuant to Article 49a of the Gas Directive, the Claimant would fail to meet the condition imposed by the provision that the derogation must not be \"detrimental to security of supply in the Union\".49\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 3 October 2022, paras. 49-51.\n\n52.\n\nFinally, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the Respondent is liable for damages from October 2021 to the period before the geopolitical developments occurred in February 2022. The Respondent argues that no evidence has been provided to substantiate the claim that the NS2 Pipeline was commercially operable from October 2021.50 The Respondent submits that the Claimant has incurred no damages attributable to the Respondent prior to February 2022.51 Further, the \"weaponisation\" of gas supplies to the European Union had started well before October 2021.52 In addition, since the Claimant would not have qualified for a derogation pursuant to Article 49a of the Gas Directive in any case, it suffered no damage from being ineligible to apply for such a derogation.53\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 150.\n\nRejoinder on Merits and Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, section 6.4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 152.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 153.\n\n53.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal terminate the arbitral proceedings.\n\n*(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant asks the Tribunal to lift the suspension of the proceedings and to issue appropriate directions for the continuation of the proceedings.54 The Claimant submits that it has the right to continue the arbitration and the Tribunal cannot terminate the arbitration under Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. It emphasizes that it has paid the advance deposits and made all other payments required by the Tribunal. Further, it is in funds and wishes to continue the arbitration.55 In these circumstances, terminating the arbitration would amount to a denial of justice.56 The Claimant adds that even if it had no funds of its own, the Claimant has \"the ability - and a legal interest - to continue with the arbitration\", and there is consequently \"no reason\" for the Tribunal to terminate the arbitration.57\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022, p. 2; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 2.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant puts forward the following arguments in response to the Respondent: (a) Article 34(2) is intended to apply to situations other than those in the present case; (b) a tribunal cannot terminate an arbitration if one or both parties object to the termination of the proceedings; (c) the arbitration has neither become impossible nor unnecessary; and (d) even if the Tribunal finds that the arbitration has become impossible or unnecessary, the request to continue the arbitration constitutes \"justifiable grounds\" under Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.58\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023. p. 2.\n\n56.\n\nFirst, the Claimant argues that Article 34(2) has applied to the following situations: when a claimant fails to pursue its case; when a claimant withdraws its case: failure by a party, or both patties, to pay required fees: the patties have settled their dispute in another forum; the parties have settled their dispute without asking for a consent award. Article 34(2) does not in its view apply to the present case.59\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022. p. 2.\n\n57.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant submits that the legislative history of Article 34(2) makes clear that even if a tribunal considers discontinuance appropriate, it must nevertheless proceed with the arbitration, if one or both parties object to termination of the proceedings.60\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022. p. 2, *citing Commentary on the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, The Application by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal* (Jacomijntje Janine van Hof. 1963), para. 4.4.1; United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 Yearbook, p. 179.\n\n58.\n\nThirdly, the Claimant submits that the arbitration has not become impossible. It emphasizes that it in funds to continue the arbitration, after receiving [REDACTED].61 The Claimant explains the[REDACTED] is intended to finance the first phase of the arbitration (referring to the hearing that was originally scheduled to take place in June 2022); it is sufficient to finance the Claimant\u2019s cost and any additional fees and costs of the arbitrators.62 The Claimant is confident that payments will be made to the Claimant [REDACTED] and there is thus no financial impediment to the Claimant going forward with this arbitration. The Claimant submits that the fact that the Cantonal Court in Zug has granted the definitive composition moratorium shows that the Court and the Administrator are satisfied that the Guarantor will make payments to the Claimant.63 Further, the Claimant points out that the Guarantor has already guaranteed and paid [REDACTED] to cover the costs of the Claimant dining the moratorium.64\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 3.\n\n59.\n\nIn response to the Repondent's criticisms of the Guarantor, the Claimant explains that the [REDACTED].65\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 4.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that it has undergone composition proceedings, and not bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The former is aimed at restoring the financial health of a company, and is initiated if the court concludes that such restoration is possible. The latter is to shut down business operations and liquidate the company to pay the creditors. In any case, the Claimant explains that, even if it were to be declared bankrupt and even if it were to be ordered to reimburse the Respondent\u2019s arbitration costs, such costs would constitute mass claims under Swiss law if they were incurred during the moratorium, and would be paid from the bankruptcy estate before any other claims.66\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 3.\n\n61.\n\nOn the issue of the US sanctions, the Claimant submits that the sanctions do not, and will not, affect the continuation of the arbitration. The Claimant argues that the Respondent conflates the effect of the sanctions on the continuation of the arbitration with their effect on the future operations of the NS2 Pipeline, when only the former issue is relevant.67 Further, the Claimant submits that the sanctions imposed on individuals and entities on the SDN list only apply to transactions that involve US persons, the US financial system and/or other US jurisdictional elements, and the secondary US sanctions resulting from the Protecting Europe\u2019s Energy Security Act (PEESA) and the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) do not have extraterritorial applicability. The Claimant points out that the current arbitration does not have a US nexus, and the Claimant\u2019s activities have a very limited US nexus. Moreover, such sanctions have been in place since 2017 and did not prevent the completion of the project. The Claimant emphasizes that no sanctions are imposed on itself and its Chief Executive Officer under the current EU or Swiss sanctions regimes, and there are no economic or trade restrictions under the EU or Swiss sanctions regimes that would make participation in the arbitration impossible.68\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022, p. 3; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, pp. 2, 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022, pp. 3-4; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, pp. 4-5.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the arbitration has not become unnecessary. The Claimant argues that it is essential for the Claimant to have the application of the relevant provisions of the Amending Directive removed with respect to the Claimant and the NS2 Pipeline. Furthermore, the Claimant submits that it is not unwilling or unable to operate the NS2 Pipeline. The Claimant submits that it was ready to start commercial operations in October 2021; it has obtained all required technical certificates and permissions. The only thing preventing the Claimant from doing so was the EU certification procedure in Germany imposed by the Amending Directive.69 In addition, the Claimant submits that it cannot be ruled out that gas from Russia will be delivered to Europe in the future.70\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022, p. 5; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022, p. 5.\n\n63.\n\nThe arbitration is also not unnecessary, the Claimant argues, because it has to be compensated for the costs and loss of revenue that incurred during the period from October 2021 to the time of the geopolitical developments of end February 2022.71\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022, pp. 5-6.\n\n64.\n\nLastly, the Claimant submits that even if the Tribunal were to find that the arbitration had become impossible or unnecessary, the request to continue the arbitration constitutes a \"justifiable ground\" under Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Relying on previous cases, the Claimant argues that as long as there is a claim from either party to be determined by the tribunal, the arbitral proceedings could not be said to be unnecessary.72\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 6, citing *Forminster Limited v The Czech Republic,* Final Award, 15 December 2014, para. 77; *Plicoflex Inc v The Islamic Republic of Iran and the National Iranian Gas Company,* Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Award No. 535-354-1, paras. 4-6.\n\n65.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal resume the arbitral proceedings.\n\n**B. Parties\u2019 Submissions on security for costs**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal is empowered to order that the Claimant post a security for costs, pursuant to Articles 15(1) and 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.73 Article 15(1) states that:\n\n[T]he arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provide that the parties are treated with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given a full opportunity of presenting his case.\n\nArticle 26(1) states that:\n\nAt the request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim measures it deems necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute, including measures for the conservation of the goods forming the subject-matter in dispute, such as ordering their deposit with a third person or the sale of perishable goods.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, paras. 60-65.\n\n*(a) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the proceedings must be terminated unless the Claimant provides adequate security for costs; otherwise, the failure to provide such security renders the arbitration impossible under Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.74 The key consideration, according to the Respondent, is \"the existence of a proven risk that 'Claimant would not reimburse Respondent for its incurred costs, be it due to Claimant\u2019s unwillingness or its inability to comply with its payment obligations\u2019\".75\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, paras. 83, 86.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, para. 66, *citing* *RSM Production Corporation v. Saint Lucia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on Saint Lucia\u2019s Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, para. 81 (**RLA-339**).\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent that the applicable standard that the Tribunal should apply is as set out in *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas et al. v. Venezuela,* involving the following requirements:76\n\n(i) \"a *prima facie* reasonable possibility that an award in favor of the respondent including its costs of representation will be rendered\" (this standard, according to the Respondent, does not require certainty nor does it require undisputed evidence);77\n\n(ii) \"the urgency of the requested measure cannot wait for the issuance of the award since it is probable that there will be a not adequately compensated damage if the order for security for costs is not granted\"; and\n\n(iii) such \"damage shall be significantly more serious than that which the party affected by the provisional measure may suffer, if the provisional measure is granted\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, paras. 67-69; Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 68, *citing* Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, 20 June 2018, para. 191 (**RLA-338**).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, paras. 71-72.\n\n69.\n\nOn the first limb, the Respondent argues that it has established a *prima facie* case through its evidence and expert reports.78 It submits that it \"cannot be denied that there is a reasonable possibility that the award will be in [its] favour\".79 It also argues the Claimant has misread the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union **(\"CJEU\")** in case C-348/20 P dated 12 July 2022. According to the Respondent, the CJEU has merely decided on the admissibility of the action for annulment. Moreover, neither the Court of Justice, nor the General Court, has pronounced on the substance of NS2\u2019s application for annulment. Thus, the judgment has procedural but not substantive value, with the consequence that it cannot be relied upon by the Claimant to argue that the Respondent has not established a *prima facie* case.80\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 74.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022. para. 81.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 77; Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, paras. 76-78.\n\n70.\n\nOn the second limb, the Respondent submits that it has satisfied the test because it has shown that, \"should the Tribunal gi ant the resumption of these proceedings without issuing an order for security for costs, the risk that the European Union suffer a damage which cannot be adequately compensated would be manifestly and unbearably high\".81 The Respondent submits that it has established the impecuniosity of the Claimant, warranting security for costs.82 It describes the current case as a \"classic situation in which security for costs should be ordered\" because the Respondent is forced to take on the risk of defending itself without any assurance that it will be made whole for its costs.83 It relies on cases in which the tribunals required the posting of security for costs where the claimant was undergoing insolvency proceedings or in the presence of a third party funder.84\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 80.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022. para. 78.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. para. 12.\n\n*Manuel Garc\u00eda Annas et al. v*. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* PCA Case No. 2016-08, 20 June 2018 **(RLA-338);** *Dirk Herzig as Insolvency' Administrator over the Assets of Unionmatex Industrieanlagen GmbH v.

[REDACTED] and\n\nd. it is doubtful that the sale of the NS2 Pipeline in case of bankruptcy of the Claimant would be enough to cover the costs of the arbitration, and the Claimant has no apparent source of self-funding;\n\n(ii) the Definitive Composition Moratorium can result in the declaration of bankruptcy of the Claimant: and\n\n(iii) the Respondent\u2019s costs have no priority over other mass claims.86\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. paras. 10, 20-29, 31-37, 45-47, 55-57.\n\n*See also* Respondent's Letter dated 12 April 2023. paras. 34-35.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the definitive composition moratorium granted by the Cantonal Court of Zug does not imply *per se* that the Claimant will have the necessary funds to complete these proceedings.87 The level of risk considered acceptable by the Swiss courts may be different from the level of risk that may justify the termination of arbitration proceedings.88 In addition, there is a 36% chance that the definitive composition moratorium will result in the opening of bankruptcy proceedings against the Claimant, based on statistics on the outcome of definitive composition moratoria in Switzerland in the period 2014-2017.89 The Respondent submits that the statistics provide credible and compelling evidence of significant risk that the Claimant\u2019s definitive composition moratorium could result in full bankruptcy proceedings.90\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. para. 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. para. 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. paras. 52-53.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023. para. 31.\n\n73.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s evidence that the Guarantor has already provided [REDACTED] Claimant previously, the Respondent argues that there is no evidence that the Claimant will receive any additional fluids beyond the end of June 2023.91 This in turn means that there is no evidence that the Claimant will be able to secure the necessary additional funds to cover its expenses for the entire duration of the Definitive Composition Moratorium, let alone for the duration of this arbitration.92\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. para. 44.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. para. 44.\n\n74.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent expresses concern that [REDACTED] will cease providing funds to the Claimant as soon as the Tribunal rules against the Claimant. According to the Respondent, there would be \"little incentive\" for [REDACTED] to continue to keep the Claimant as a going concern. The Respondent argues that the Claimant and [REDACTED] are used as an instrument for the Russian Federation\u2019s foreign policy, and the government of the Russian Federation might view it as politically unacceptable to fund any payments to the Respondent in connection with the NS2 Pipeline.93\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023. para. 10.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent urges the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from the decision of the Claimant to submit the Redacted Documents instead of unredacted versions, or at the very least, find the Redacted Documents not to be probative.94 The Respondent claims that the redacted sections are relevant to assessing whether the Claimant is and will remain in fluids for the arbitration.95 The Respondent further submits that the Redacted Documents fail to establish that the Claimant will be able to make good on any costs award in this arbitration.96\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. paras. 13-14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. para. 14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023. para. 12.\n\n76.\n\nOn the third limb regarding proportionality, the Respondent submits that it is seeking to prevent the situation where it would be unable to recover the costs it would be entitled to.97 It argues that the Claimant has admitted that it might be able to pay no more than a portion of the costs of arbitration, on the basis of its submission that \"it cannot credibly be argued that there would be *any* lack of funds to reimburse *any* of the Respondent\u2019s arbitration costs\" (emphasis added by Respondent).98 Regarding the proportionality of the amount of security requested, the Respondent argues that EUR 5.65 million is proportionate and is a \"conservative amount\".99 First, it is only a fraction of the alleged losses claimed by the Claimant.100 Second, the Respondent has already accounted for the amount of deposit paid by the Claimant in the sum of [REDACTED].101\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022. paras. 104-106.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 16 December 2022, para. 81, *citing* Claimant\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 24 November 2022, p. 7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, para. 108.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, para. 109.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, para. 110.\n\n77.\n\nTurning to the amount of security, the Respondent requests EUR 5.65 million secured by \"an irrevocable bank guarantee issued by a reputable international bank located in the European Union\" valid \"until 30 days after the award in this arbitration is rendered\".102 The amount of security is to cover the Respondent\u2019s legal fees, costs and expenses, including the Tribunal\u2019s and the PCA\u2019s administrative costs.103\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, paras. 123, 125; Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023, para. 27.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 26 October 2022, paras. 114-122; Respondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023, para. 27.\n\n*(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n78.\n\nFrom the outset, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is wrong to conflate the applicability of Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules and the issue of security for costs.104\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 1; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 2.\n\n79.\n\nOn the issue of security for costs, the Claimant argues that the request must be denied. First, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has not established a *prima facie* case. In this regard, the Claimant places importance on the decision by the CJEU in case C-348/20 P. According to the Claimant, the CJEU made its findings with a view to determining whether the Claimant is directly or individually concerned and affected by the Amending Directive.105 The CJEU did find that the Claimant was directly and individually concerned and affected.106 In particular, the Claimant submits that the CJEU found that (i) the Amending Directive affects the Claimant by changing its legal status, (ii) those effects on the Claimant did not exist prior to the adoption of the Amending Directive, (iii) the contents of the Amending Directive treats the Claimant differently than all other pipelines, and (iv) this different treatment is fully attributable to the Respondent.107 The Claimant submits that since these are core elements of its case, the findings in case C-348/20 P support its case and undermine the Respondent\u2019s attempt to establish a *prima facie* case.108\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 8.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 10.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022, p. 6; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 10.\n\n80.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to prove that the Claimant is impecunious.109 The Claimant argues that the burden of proof lies with the Respondent; the Claimant does not bear the burden to prove that money will be readily available.110\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 10; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 2.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that the Cantonal Court in Zug has granted a definitive composition moratorium of six months as of 10 January 2023. The Claimant argues that the \"mere fact that the Cantonal Court of Zug has approved a definitive composition moratorium ... *does* imply that Claimant will have the necessary fluids to complete this arbitration\".111 The Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s use of statistics concerning the probability of bankruptcy proceedings, arguing that statistics are not accurate predictions for individual cases.112\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 4 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 4.\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant explains that the requirements for a definitive composition moratorium are higher than those for a provisional composition moratorium, and the definitive composition moratorium was granted to the Claimant after consideration of the Administrator\u2019s report.113 The Administrator explained in his report that the Guarantor has previously provided [REDACTED] and that the amounts had been transferred to the Claimant. The Administrator also informed that the Guarantor has provided an [REDACTED] to the Claimant\u2019s costs during the first half of 2023. The Claimant explains that the Cantonal Court in Zug granted the definitive composition moratorium relying on the track record of the Guarantor. It further argues that there is every reason to expect that the Guarantor will honour its obligations [REDACTED]114 The Claimant relies on a letter from its Administrator. Transliq AG, which states:115\n\nI can confirm explicitly that all mass liabilities that have arisen since 10 May 2022 have been paid in full thanks to the guarantees granted by the third party to date. All employees, service providers and contractors have been continuously paid for their work and services for the period after 10 May 2022. The newly incurred costs will continue to be paid, thanks to the guarantee granted for the definitive composition moratorium. Practically three months have already passed since the definitive composition moratorium was granted and all new arising debts have been paid by the Claimant for this period as well.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 11.\n\nLetter from Transliq AG, 29 March 2023 **[Appendix No. 1 to Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023].**\n\n83.\n\nFurther, the Claimant points out that [REDACTED] has also given [REDACTED].116\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 11; Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 24 November 2022. Appendix 5.\n\n84.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant argues that it has other assets besides the claim in this arbitration, including the pipelines. The Claimant states that [REDACTED] as confirmed by the Administrator.117 Further assets [REDACTED].118 In the event of bankruptcy, the proceeds would be used to serve to satisfy the mass creditors.119\n\nLetter from Transliq AG, 29 March 2023 **[Appendix No. 1 to Claimant\u2019s Letter dated 12 April 2023].**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 3.\n\n85.\n\nLastly, the Claimant submits that, even if it were to be declared bankrupt and even if it were to be ordered to pay the Respondent\u2019s costs, such costs inclined during the moratorium would be paid before any other claims.120 The Claimant explains that the Respondent\u2019s claim in relation to its arbitration costs would be classified as a mass claim, which has priority right after the expenses of the composition proceedings. The Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s claim would \"practically enjoy a super-privilege\" since the expenses of the composition proceedings would be of \"no significance\".121\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 1 February 2023, p. 11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter dated 29 March 2023, p. 5.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent has made two applications: the first is for the termination of the arbitration proceeding under Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules; the second is for an order for security for costs under Articles 15(1) and 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. They overlap to a significant extent on their underlying rationale. Nevertheless, the legal provisions and legal tests for determining these issues remain distinct. The Tribunal therefore examines each in turn, albeit referring only to those considerations necessary to its decision on each.\n\n**A. Termination of the Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe text of Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules predicates the power of the tribunal to terminate arbitral proceedings on the grounds that \"the *continuation* of the arbitral proceedings becomes *unnecessary* or *impossible*\" (emphasis added). Given that the text clearly refers to the \"continuation\" of arbitral proceedings, the Tribunal has difficulty agreeing with the Respondent that the test of necessity or impossibility pertains to the \"complet[ion]\" of the arbitral proceedings.122 Moreover, Article 34(2) grants a discretion to the Tribunal to decide whether to order termination. The language does not dictate that a tribunal must terminate arbitral proceedings, even if the article\u2019s predicates are fulfilled. While the text does not grant any party a veto over the termination of the proceedings\u2014the objection to termination must be required to be \"justifiable\" in the circumstances\u2014the Tribunal considers that a presumption nevertheless exists in principle against terminating proceedings in the face of a party\u2019s objection.123\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter dated 10 March 2023, para. 5.\n\nDavid Caron and Lee Caplan, The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 864.\n\n88.\n\nOn the impossibility limb of Article 34(2), the Tribunal observes that the US sanctions have had serious implications for the Claimant\u2019s ability to operate the NS2 Pipeline, and also on the Claimant\u2019s ability to pursue this arbitration. This was acknowledged by the Claimant, in its letter dated 1 March 2022, where it informed the Tribunal that \"the designation of Nord Stream 2 AG as a US Specially Designated National (SDN) on 23 February 2022 and recent geopolitical developments have led to an inability on the part of the Claimant to pursue the arbitration at this time\". Nevertheless, the Tribunal is persuaded that there are no restrictions under the sanction regimes, including the EU and Swiss regimes, which would make participation in the current arbitration impossible. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the main impediment to the continuation of the arbitral proceedings was the lack of funds - no doubt exacerbated by the US sanctions - instead of the US sanctions in and of themselves. Given that the Claimant has now obtained the funds to continue the arbitral proceedings at least until the end of 2024, the Tribunal finds it difficult to agree with the Respondent that the continuation of the proceedings has become impossible.\n\n89.\n\nTurning to the necessity limb of Article 34(2), the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has also failed to show that the continuation of the arbitral proceedings has become unnecessary. The main thrust of the Respondent\u2019s argument is that the Claimant would be unable to operate the NS2 Pipeline as a result of US sanctions, economic considerations, and damage to the NS2 Pipeline, or would choose not to operate the NS2 Pipeline for geopolitical reasons regardless of the outcome of this arbitration. The Tribunal finds that these expectations involve a significant degree of speculation, including on matters of fact, and may touch upon issues that are part of the substantive aspects of this proceeding. The geopolitical situation may change, and the NS2 Pipeline may prove to be reparable. In any event, the Tribunal is persuaded by the Claimant\u2019s submission that there is a dispute over the Respondent\u2019s liability for damages prior to February 2022, which is independent from the current geopolitical scenario. The existence of this claim is sufficient at this juncture to find that the arbitration has not become without object.\n\n90.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the continuation of the arbitral proceedings is neither unnecessary nor impossible. Thus, the Tribunal finds, on the basis of the material that is before it at present, that the criteria for the termination of arbitral proceedings under Article 34(2) are not met.\n\n**B. Security for Costs**\n-------------------------\n\n91.\n\nPreliminarily, the Tribunal finds that it has the power to order interim measures, including security for costs, under Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Other tribunals have taken the same view.124 The Tribunal also does not understand the Respondent to contest the Tribunal\u2019s competence in this regard. Furthermore, the Parties appear to agree on the proper factors to be taken into account in determining whether to order security for costs, namely the general requirements for interim measures as adapted to the situation of security for costs by the tribunal in *Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas* among various others.125 These requirements include: (i) a reasonable possibility that an award in favour of the applicant, including its costs of legal representation, could be rendered; (ii) a reasonable risk that the applicant will not be able to recover the costs awarded in its favour from the other party; and (iii) an assessment that the harm of non-recovery substantially outweighs the harm of an order for security for costs.\n\n*Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, 20 June 2018, paras. 186-187 (**RLA-338**); *South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia,* PCA Case No. 2013-15, Procedural Order No. 10, 11 January 2016, para. 52.\n\n*Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, PCA Case No. 2016-08, Procedural Order No. 9, 20 June 2018, para. 191 (**RLA-338**).\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant relies heavily on the decision by the CJEU in case C-348/20P, and asserts that this recent development undercuts the Respondent\u2019s *prima facie* case on the merits, let alone costs. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has established a reasonable possibility of an award on costs in its favour. To decide otherwise would require the Tribunal to pronounce itself on issues of liability, which would be inappropriate at this stage.\n\n93.\n\nAs regards the further two requirements, the Tribunal considers that the risks weigh in the favour of the requested order for security for costs. Even though the arrangements made by the Claimant to finance the arbitration are sufficient to reassure the Tribunal of the Claimant\u2019s ability to resume and pursue its claims these proceedings, they are not sufficient to allay reasonable concerns about its ability\u2014independent of the intentions or actions of other members [REDACTED]\u2014to cover an adverse costs award if the Tribunal were to so rule. Whereas the Claimant can rely on the support of other members of the corporate group to help finance the costs of the proceedings, an award of costs to the Respondent would only be enforceable against the Claimant itself, who acknowledges that it is presently relying on the support of its Guarantor and shareholders to meet its own costs.\n\n94.\n\nThe support of the Claimant\u2019s Guarantor and shareholders also demonstrates the Claimant\u2019s ability to cover both its own costs and security for the Respondent\u2019s costs in a reasonable amount. An order for security for costs would therefore not appear to risk denying the Claimant the ability to pursue this arbitration, whereas it would leave the Respondent without sufficiently reliable guarantees that it would be able to collect on an award of costs. The foregoing considerations lead the Tribunal to conclude that an order for security for costs is, on the material that has been made available to it, necessary to protect the Respondent\u2019s rights.\n\n95.\n\nAs for the appropriate amount of security for costs, the Tribunal considers this to be [REDACTED] . In addition, the Tribunal intends to request a supplementary deposit from the Parties in the amount of [REDACTED] from each Party) in order to ensure sufficient funds to continue the proceedings. In reaching these figures, the Tribunal has taken note in particular of the amount of [REDACTED] as the Claimant\u2019s own estimate of its potential costs in the next phase of these proceedings. The Tribunal considers this adequate security for the period until it renders its award in the present phase of the proceedings, after which it may revisit the need for security as well as its modalities.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n96.\n\nHaving carefully considered the circumstances and the Parties\u2019 respective submissions, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s application for the termination of the arbitration, accepts the Respondent\u2019s application for security for costs, and orders as follows:\n\n(i) the Claimant shall deposit with the PCA the amount of [REDACTED] as security for the Respondent\u2019s costs of legal representation;\n\n(ii) the Parties shall make a supplementary deposit of [REDACTED] from each Party) in order to ensure sufficient funds for the Tribunal\u2019s costs;\n\n(iii) the Tribunal may modify, suspend, or terminate this order upon application of any party or on the Tribunal\u2019s own initiative on account of any material change in the circumstances on the basis of which this order was requested or granted; and\n\n(iv) the Tribunal shall in any event revisit this order following its award in the present phase of proceedings.\n\n**So ordered by the Tribunal.**"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 12", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2023-10-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 12\n-----------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy e-mail of 1 March 2022, the Claimant informed the Tribunal as follows:\n\nThe designation of Nord Stream 2 AG as a US Specially Designated National (SDN) on 23 February 2022 and recent geopolitical developments have led to an inability on the part of the Claimant to pursue the arbitration at this time. In particular, the Claimant's bank accounts have been blocked, meaning NSP2AG is unable to make any payments or access finance.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant consequently requested a suspension of the arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 14 March 2022, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that its external counsel no longer represented it and reiterated its request for a suspension of the arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 March 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, suspending the arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 30 June 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, fixing a new procedural meeting for 13 October 2022, at which the Claimant would be invited to update the Tribunal regarding its circumstances and ability to continue the proceedings, and the Parties may thereafter make submissions on the further conduct of the proceedings. The Tribunal also indicated that, for any further suspension to be granted, the Claimant would be required to provide further information demonstrating a reasonable possibility of resuming the arbitration. In the absence thereof, the Tribunal would commence the procedure for terminating the present arbitration in accordance with Article 34(2) of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976.\n\n6.\n\nBy e-mail of 22 July 2022, the Respondent submitted a Request for Security for Costs.\n\n7.\n\nBy e-mail of 22 August 2022, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs.\n\n8.\n\nOn 2 September 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, deciding that that a case has not been made for urgency to determine the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs, given that the arbitration is suspended, and may not proceed further. The Tribunal further stated that should the Claimant indicate an intention to resume the arbitration or in the event of any other material change of circumstances, the Respondent may resubmit a Request for Security for Costs.\n\n9.\n\nBy e-mail of 26 October 2022, the Respondent submitted another Request for Security for Costs.\n\n10.\n\nOn 27 October 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, deciding to continue the suspension of the proceedings, pending the consideration of further submissions from the Parties, deferring its decisions on security for costs and the termination of proceedings.\n\n11.\n\nOn 14 July 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, rejecting the Respondent's application for the termination of the arbitration and accepting the Respondent's application for security for costs. The Tribunal ordered the Claimant to deposit with the PCA the amount of [REDACTED] as security for the Respondent's costs of legal representation.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 24 July 2023, the Tribunal requested that, by 31 July 2023, the Parties confer and revert, jointly or individually, with regard to the next steps and the timetable for the remainder of the present phase of the arbitration.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of 31 July 2023, the Respondent submitted its proposal for the procedural calendar.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 12 September 2023, the Claimant provided a revised procedural calendar on the basis of the one submitted by Respondent.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of 14 September 2023, Respondent presented its comments on the revised timetable proposed by the Claimant.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of 4 October 2023, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the Claimant's security for Respondent's costs of legal representation in the ordered amount of [REDACTED].\n\n**II. PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n----------------------------\n\n17.\n\nBoth Parties are in agreement that, once the arbitration is resumed, two additional rounds of written submissions are required to brief the Tribunal on the relevant factual developments which have occurred since the staying of the proceedings.1\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 31 July 2023; Claimant's Letter dated 12 September 2023; Respondent's Letter dated 14 September 2023.\n\n18.\n\nRespondent has proposed that these supplementary submissions should be supported by further factual evidence, witness statements and expert reports, if appropriate.2\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 31 July 2023, para. 5.\n\n19.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the submissions should be filed sequentially, beginning with Claimant and then by Respondent, in two rounds.3 The deadline for the first procedural step in the new timetable should start running on the date on which the Tribunal issues an order resuming the proceedings, with each subsequent deadline to be counted from the deadline for the submission of the preceding submission by the other party.4\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 31 July 2023, paras. 6-7.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 31 July 2023, para. 9.\n\n20.\n\nIn its response, the Claimant in general agreed with the Respondent's proposals, with only slight suggested deviations:\n\nThe briefs should focus on any updates in the light of the factual developments since these proceedings were suspended. The briefs should explain any impacts those factual developments have or do not have on this case. The first round should cover Jurisdiction and Merits for each Party. The second round should give the Claimant another opportunity to respond to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. In addition, both parties should have an opportunity to exchange any comments they may have on the merits of this case.5\n\nClaimant's Letter dated 12 September, p. 1.\n\n21.\n\nClaimant's suggestions for the procedural timetable also included a note that the deadlines were presented \"excluding holiday season\".6\n\nClaimant's Letter dated 12 September, p. 2.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent's reply contained a general agreement to the Claimant's suggestions, with the caveat that:\n\n- both Parties should receive the same amount of time to file their respective first submission; and\n\n- \"Christmas/End of Year [\u2026], Easter [\u2026] and Summer\",7 should be considered \"holiday periods\".8\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 September 2023, para. 5.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 September 2023, para. 5.\n\n23.\n\nIn its subsequent communications, the Claimant did not contest the Respondent's proposed modifications.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Lifting of the suspension of the proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges receipt of the PCA's letter dated 4 October 2023 confirming that the Claimant had deposited the [REDACTED] ordered under Procedural Order No. 11 as security for Respondent's legal costs.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant having deposited the security for costs in the amount ordered, the Tribunal hereby lifts the suspension of the proceedings.\n\n**B. Parties' supplementary submissions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of the Parties' agreement on the need to file additional submissions to brief it on the relevant factual developments which occurred since the beginning of the stay of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Parties may submit the following filings:\n\n- Claimant's Supplementary Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits;\n\n- Respondent's Supplementary Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits;\n\n- Claimant's Supplementary Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits; and\n\n- Respondent's Supplementary Reply on Merits.\n\n27.\n\nThese submissions may be supported by factual evidence, witness statements and expert reports, if appropriate. Provisions of Procedural Order No. 1 on \"Evidence and Legal Authorities\"9 shall apply *mutatis mutandis*.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, Section 6.\n\n**C. Procedural Calendar**\n--------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes of the Respondent's remark that \"in order to ensure equality of treatment between the parties\", it should be accorded five months instead of four to file its CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction and Merits, to match the time granted to Claimant for filing its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits.10 As a result, the Tribunal has equalized the time limits for both Parties' first submissions to a period of four months, which it deems sufficient in light of these filings' supplementary character.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 31 July 2023, para. 5.\n\n29.\n\nThe current stage of the arbitration shall resume in accordance with the procedural calendar attached to this Procedural Order as Annex I, prepared on the basis of the Parties' suggestions and the decision in the preceding paragraph.\n\n30.\n\nFollowing the Parties' further agreement on the need to account for \"holiday periods\", in calculating the deadlines, the Tribunal has discounted the following periods:\n\n- 23 December 2023\u20135 January 2024 (fourteen days); and\n\n- 25 March\u20131 April 2024 (eight days).\n\n31.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has also endeavoured to avoid deadlines falling in the month of August.\n\n**So ordered by the Tribunal.**\n\n**Annex 1: Procedural Calendar**\n--------------------------------\n\n[32].\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Event** | **Date** |\n| Claimant's Supplementary Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits | Tuesday, 27 February 2024 |\n| Respondent's Supplementary Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits | Thursday, 4 July 2024 |\n| Claimant's Supplementary Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits | Monday, 2 September 2024 |\n| Respondent's Supplementary Reply on Merits | Monday, 4 November 2024 |\n| Parties to notify each other of the names of the witnesses of the other Party not required to be available for cross-examination at the Hearing | TBD |\n| Pre-hearing procedural conference in advance of Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits | TBD |\n| Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits | January-March 2025 (exact dates TBD) |"}]}
