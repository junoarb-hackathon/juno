PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Request for Arbitration**\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 28 May 2008, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a request for arbitration dated 22 May 2008 (the \"Request\") filed by Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH, Windjammer Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG, Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz as the insolvency administrator of Inmaris Windjammer Sailing GmbH i.L., and Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz as the insolvency administrator of Inmaris Windjammer Chartering GmbH i.L. (\"Claimants\") against Ukraine (\"Respondent\") (collectively, the \"parties\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Request was made under the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Ukraine for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments signed on 15 February 1993 and entered into force on 29 June 1996 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 29 May 2008, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted a copy of the Request to Respondent.\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 June 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID sent the parties a Notice of Registration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the parties, in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, to proceed as soon as possible to constitute an arbitral tribunal in accordance with Articles 37-40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIn the Request, Claimants proposed that a three-member tribunal be appointed, and proposed that each party would appoint an arbitrator (Claimants in the Request, and Respondent within 20 days after registration of the Request), and that the two party-appointed arbitrators should jointly designate a third arbitrator to be President of the Tribunal within 15 days of the second arbitrator's appointment, with the Secretary-General to appoint any arbitrators remaining to be appointed within the designated time periods. In the Request, Claimants purported to appoint Mr. Noah Rubins, a national of the United States, as arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 4 July 2008, Respondent agreed that the Tribunal should consist of three arbitrators, but rejected the balance of Claimants' proposal with respect to the method of constituting the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nPursuant to Rule 2(3) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), Claimants on 16 August 2008 elected that the Tribunal be constituted pursuant to the formula specified in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. ICSID acknowledged that election by letter dated 18 August 2008 and invited the parties to proceed with the appointment of arbitrators.\n\n9.\n\nClaimants on 18 August 2008 appointed Mr. Rubins as a member of the Tribunal. Respondent on 27 August 2008 appointed Mr. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of Spain, as a member of the Tribunal. By letter of 2 September 2008, Mr. Rubins made a disclosure with respect to two ongoing engagements on behalf of Ukraine (unrelated to the present case), as to which both parties expressly waived any objection in letters dated 4 and 5 September 2008, respectively.\n\n10.\n\nOn 27 August 2008, Claimants proposed Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, to serve as the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal. On 10 September 2008, Respondent agreed to that proposal.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal was formally constituted on 19 September 2008, in accordance with the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Ms. A\u00efssatou Diop, Consultant, ICSID, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nUpon registration of the Request, Respondent on 18 June 2008 indicated its intention to provide by 1 July 2008 preliminary observations on the claims, which Respondent considered to be manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. Respondent did not ultimately make such a submission.\n\n13.\n\nOn 3 December 2008, however, shortly before the first session of the Tribunal with the parties, Respondent in a letter advanced objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Respondent requested, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(3), that its objections be addressed as a preliminary matter in a separate jurisdictional phase, and asked the Tribunal to address the schedule for such a phase at the first session. Claimants by letter dated 8 December 2008 contended that the jurisdictional objections should be joined to the merits.\n\n**D. First Session of the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held by telephone conference (with audio recording) on 9 December 2008. The parties each expressly confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted, and that they had no objection to any of its members serving as arbitrator. During the session, the parties agreed on several procedural matters, having submitted a joint statement on such procedures to the Tribunal in advance of the session. The Tribunal heard both parties on their respective views on certain issues as to which they did not agree, including the procedure to be adopted with respect to Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nThe agreement of the parties, and the decisions of the Tribunal on matters as to which the parties were not agreed, were recorded in the Minutes of the First Session signed by the President and Secretary of the Tribunal, dated 17 December 2008. The Tribunal decided, *inter alia*, that Respondent's jurisdictional objections should be addressed in a separate, preliminary phase of the proceedings. The following schedule was set for the jurisdictional phase:\n\n\u2022 Respondent to file its Memorial on Jurisdiction by 28 January 2009;\n\n\u2022 Claimants to file their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction by 16 March 2009;\n\n\u2022 Respondent to file its Reply on Jurisdiction by 27 April 2009;\n\n\u2022 Claimants to file their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction by 8 June 2009;\n\n\u2022 A hearing on jurisdiction, if determined to be necessary, to be held in The Hague on 20-21 July 2009 (following a pre-hearing conference to be held on 7 July 2009).\n\n**E. Parties' Submissions on Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nRespondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction (dated 23 January 2009) on 27 January 2009.\n\n17.\n\nUpon a request from Claimants, the parties agreed to extend the schedule for Claimants' Counter-Memorial by one week, with corresponding changes to subsequent filing dates (11 May 2009 for the Reply, and 22 June 2009 for the Rejoinder). Claimants' CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction was then filed on 23 March 2009.\n\n18.\n\nRespondent's Reply was filed on 18 May 2009 under an extension to Respondent's filing deadline, to which Claimants consented. On 22 May 2009, Respondent sought leave to file a witness statement of Mr. O.S. Kachniy, citing logistical difficulties that had impaired Respondent's efforts to file the statement together with the Reply. Claimants on 29 May 2009 advised that they did not object to the admission of the witness statement of Mr. Kachniy.\n\n19.\n\nRespondent on 23 June 2009 asked the Tribunal to order Claimants to desist from contacting Respondent's current and former employees. The Tribunal on 25 June 2009 instructed Claimants to refrain from contact with Respondent's current employees. The Tribunal indicated that, with respect to former employees of Respondent, it would consider any applications on a case-by-case basis. The parties then exchanged further correspondence about Claimants' contacts with Respondent's employees, and Respondent's contacts with witnesses whose statements were submitted by Claimants. The Tribunal on 3 July 2009 issued an order instructing both parties to refrain from contacting each other's witnesses, and directing that any allegations of witness intimidation must be supported and documented. The Tribunal's order also dealt with certain arrangements for witness testimony at the upcoming hearing.\n\n20.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder was filed on 6 July 2009 under an extension to Claimants' filing deadline, to which Respondent consented.\n\n21.\n\nA pre-hearing conference with the President of the Tribunal and the parties was held on 10 July 2009 by telephone (with audio recording). The parties agreed on a number of procedural matters for the upcoming hearing, having exchanged views by correspondence in advance of the pre-hearing conference. The Tribunal resolved other matters regarding the conduct of the hearing as to which the parties had not agreed. The parties' agreements and the Tribunal's decisions were recorded in the Minutes of the Pre-Hearing Conference, which were circulated to the parties on 13 July 2009.\n\n22.\n\nRespondent on 13 July 2009 requested leave to introduce a late-discovered document into the record. On 15 July 2009, Claimants sought permission to introduce two newly discovered documents into the record. All three documents were admitted to the record of the case. Respondent on 16 July 2009 advised that its witness Ms. Lyudmyla Poltavtseva, who had been called for examination at the upcoming hearing, would be unable to give testimony (in person or by video) due to a severe illness of a close family member.\n\n**F. Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe hearing on Respondent's objections to jurisdiction was held in The Hague at the Permanent Court of Arbitration on 20 and 21 July 2009.\n\n24.\n\nThe parties were represented in The Hague as follows:\n\nClaimants:\n\nDr. Ulrich Theune, Dr. Richard Happ, Mr. Georg-Maximilian von Arnim, and Ms. Yun-I Kim of Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft\n\nRespondent:\n\nDr. Sergei Voitovich, Mr. Dmitri Grischenko, Mr. Sava Poliakov, and Mr. Dmitri Shemelin of Grischenko & Partners\n\n25.\n\nMs. Jojanneke Deelstra of Omni Bridgeway was also present at the hearing as part of Claimants' delegation.\n\n26.\n\nIn opening statements, Mr. Shemelin addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Respondent, and Dr. Happ addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Claimants. The following witnesses were then examined in person before the Tribunal:\n\nMr. Uwe Koch   \nMr. Alexander Gohring   \nMr. Geoffrey Senogles   \nMr. Oleksii Rieznikov   \nMr. Vasyl Chernik\n\nIn addition, the following witnesses were examined by video link from the World Bank offices in Kyiv, Ukraine, in the presence of counsel for both parties:\n\nMr. Oleksandr Kachniy   \nMr. Yuriy Illarionov   \nMr. Oleksiy Vinnov   \nMr. Vitaliy Kolodyazhnyi   \nMr. Mykhailo Sukhina\n\n27.\n\nThe hearing was audio recorded and a verbatim transcript was prepared. The parties subsequently proposed corrections to the transcript, a corrected version of which was circulated to the parties on 4 November 2009.\n\n28.\n\nThe parties submitted Post-Hearing Briefs simultaneously on 1 September 2009.\n\n29.\n\nOn 4 December 2009, Respondent advised the Tribunal of certain developments regarding the status of the sail training ship *Khersones*, on which Claimants commented on 29 December 2009. Respondent on 29 December 2009 advised that it would consider providing quarterly updates on the ship's status. The Tribunal took note of the parties' correspondence on the subject.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n30.\n\nWe turn first to a brief synopsis of the facts of the dispute, to the limited extent that such facts are necessary to understand the context of Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and the Tribunal's decisions thereon. The Tribunal believes the following facts to be undisputed between the parties, except where indicated in context below. This recitation of the factual background of the dispute is set forth without prejudice to any further development of and findings on these same facts as may occur in later stages of the proceedings, should the Tribunal determine that it has jurisdiction and the case move forward to the merits.\n\n**A. The Inmaris Companies**\n----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAs noted above, claims in this proceeding are brought on behalf of multiple companies, which Claimants refer to as the Inmaris Companies. They include:\n\n\u2022 *Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH* (\"IPS\"), a limited liability company established in 1989 and registered with the commercial register of the local court in Hamburg, Germany. It is owned by individual shareholders, including Captain Uwe Koch.1\n\n\u2022 *Windjammer Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG* (\"WKG\"), a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellchaft) registered with the commercial register of the local court in L\u00fcbeck, Germany. It is represented by a single general partner (\"GP\"), and has 29 individuals as limited partners (\"LPs\").2 Claimants explain that IPS was the general partner of WKG until 2001, and later resumed that role in 2008. In the interim period between 2001 and 2008, IWS (see below) was the general partner of WKG.3 Claimants describe WKG as a typical German \"ship investment fund\" or a \"closed end fund\" for the financing of ships.4\n\n\u2022 *Inmaris Windjammer Chartering GmbH i.L* (\"IWC\"), a limited liability company formed in 1999 and registered with the commercial register of the local court of Hamburg, Germany.5 As of February 2009, IWC had two shareholders: WKG (49%) and IWS (51%).6 IWC was put under insolvency administration and went into liquidation proceedings on 30 November 2006; Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz, the Insolvency Administrator, appears on behalf of IWC as Claimant in this proceeding.7\n\n\u2022 *Inmaris Windjammer Sailing GmbH i.L* (\"IWS\") *,* a limited liability company formed in 2001 and registered with the commercial register of the local court of Hamburg, Germany.8 It is owned by individual shareholders, including Captain Uwe Koch.9 IWS was also put under insolvency administration and went into liquidation proceedings on 30 November 2006; Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz, the Insolvency Administrator, appears on behalf of IWS as Claimant in this proceeding.10\n\n*See* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Ex. C-7).\n\n*See* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the L\u00fcbeck Local Court, 11 February 2009 (Ex. C-8).\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 23 March 2001 (\"Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction\") at para. 21; Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the L\u00fcbeck Local Court, 11 February 2009 (Ex. C-8) (identifying IPS as current general partner of WKG, noting that last update to registration was 8 May 2008); Letter from WKG to KMTI, 22 December 2001 (Ex. C-9) (notifying change of \"Complementary shareholder\" of WKG from IPS to IWS).\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 20.\n\n*See* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 19 February 2009 (Ex. C-10).\n\n*See* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 19 February 2009 (Ex. C-10). Inasmuch as IWS was not formed until August 2001, *see* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Ex. C-11), the 51% share held by IWS as of February 2009 was necessarily held by another entity prior to August 2001. However, the Excerpt from the Commercial Register for IWC appears to indicate that IWS held that stake in IWC as of October 2002 (*i.e.* well in advance of April 2006). As will be seen from the Tribunal's analysis in Section IV.A.4 below, this timing question ultimately is not determinative of the question of whether IWS is a proper Claimant in this arbitration.\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 19 February 2009 (Ex. C-10). For convenience, the Tribunal in this Decision will refer to IWC, even though Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz is formally the Claimant on IWC's behalf.\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Ex. C-11). IWS was apparently formed originally under the name Profundus Acte Vermogensverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH, but was renamed and repurposed as IWS on 21 December 2001. *See id.*\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Ex. C-11).\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Ex. C-11). For convenience, the Tribunal in this Decision will refer to IWS, even though Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz is formally the Claimant on IWS' behalf.\n\n32.\n\nWhile the different companies played different roles at different times in the events to be discussed below, it is useful at this point to diagram the corporate relationships of the Inmaris Companies as they are understood to have stood in April 2006, when the dispute came to a head. The diagram below sets out only the corporate structure; the various contractual arrangements among and involving these companies are discussed in the Sections that follow.\n\n**B. Operations in 1991-1999**\n------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe *Khersones*, a windjammer sail training ship, is owned by the Kerch Maritime Technological Institute (\"KMTI\"), a state-owned education institution of Ukraine. KMTI is controlled by the State Committee for Fishery of Ukraine (the \"Committee\"), which in turn is controlled by the Minister of Agricultural Policy of Ukraine. The *Khersones* ' stated purpose is the education of cadets for Ukraine's national fishery fleet.\n\n34.\n\nBetween early 1991 and late 1996, IPS contracted on a short term basis with the *Khersones* ' owner to operate the *Khersones* and to market sailing tours and other onboard events, while at the same time continuing to provide training to Ukrainian cadets.\n\n35.\n\nIn November 1996, IPS and KMTI concluded a longer-term contract (referred to by the parties as the \"Basic Contract\") regarding the *Khersones*. Under the Basic Contract, the *Khersones* would continue to be used for the training of Ukrainian cadets, but would also be operated and marketed by IPS for, *inter alia*, \"touristic and representative services\" and would be used \"to carry out cruises, for publicity campaigns, advertising measures and chartering to third parties.\"11 In exchange for this exclusive right to market the ship and receive the income from those additional activities, IPS was to cover all operational expenses for the *Khersones* (including the cadet training).\n\nContract on Cooperation over the Operation of the Sail Training Ship STS \"*Khersones*\", 26 November 1996, at Section 3 (Ex. C-21) (\"Basic Contract\").\n\n36.\n\nPursuant to an Addendum to the Basic Contract signed in April 1998, IPS reported approximately annually to KMTI on the financial results of the *Khersones* ' operations.12\n\n*See* Akte 1998 (Ex. C-54); Akte 1999 (Ex. C-55).\n\n**C. Bareboat Charter and Related Contracts**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nFor several years, the parties discussed the need to renovate the *Khersones* with amenities to make it more marketable, and to make significant repairs. It appears to be common ground that KMTI lacked the funds to finance such a reconstruction itself.\n\n38.\n\nClaimants contend that in 1999, Captain Koch discussed with KMTI and the Committee different financing options for reconstruction of the *Khersones*. Both parties agree that the first option explored\u2014IPS obtaining a commercial loan\u2014was unavailing because the *Khersones*, as Ukrainian state-owned property, could not be pledged as collateral for such a loan.13 A second option was then developed by IPS: the creation of a German ship investment fund to solicit funds directly from investors, carry out the reconstruction, and then recoup the funds by operating the *Khersones* under a bareboat charter (analogous to a lease) from KMTI. Claimants contend that the contractual structure associated with this option was explained to, and developed with the consent and participation of, the KMTI and the Committee. Respondent however, calls the contractual arrangements non-transparent, excessively complicated, and ultimately \"fictitious.\"14\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 60-62; Witness Statement of V.H. Chernik, 12 May 2009 (Ex. R-18).\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, 18 May 2009 (\"Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction\") at paras. 39, 41.\n\n39.\n\nWhile their legal significance is a matter of contention, it is not disputed that KMTI entered into multiple contracts with various of the Inmaris Companies in connection with this financing arrangement. They are:\n\n\u2022 *Four-Party Agreement* among KMTI, IPS, WKG, and IWC signed on 11 October 1999.15 This Agreement provided that the parties would (i) enter into various contracts, including a Bareboat Charter contract between KMTI and WKG, and (ii) suspend the 1996 Basic Contract for the duration of the Bareboat Charter.\n\n\u2022 *Bareboat Charter* and Addendum 1 between KMTI and WKG signed on 11 October 1999.16 (An Addendum 2 to the Bareboat Charter was also submitted by both parties in their exhibits, although the date of its signature is not specified; Claimants state that it was signed \"in 2001. \")17 Under the Bareboat Charter, WKG was granted a 5-year charter (subject to extensions) in return for a one-time charter hire (*i.e.* payment) of DM 600,000.\n\n\u2022 *Donation Contract* between KMTI and WKG signed on 11 October 1999, pursuant to which WKG agreed to make a further DM 500,000 \"non-refundable contribution\" toward the reconstruction of the *Khersones* (the total cost of which was estimated at DM 1,100,000).\n\n\u2022 *Trustee Contract* between KMTI and IPS signed on 11 October 1999, pursuant to which IPS would act as Trustee for KMTI to receive the DM 1,100,000 (charter hire plus \"donation\") from WKG and to disburse it solely for the reconstruction and renovation of the *Khersones*.18\n\n\u2022 *Crewing Contract* between KMTI and WKG signed on 11 October 1999, pursuant to which KMTI would continue to supply the crew and cadets for the *Khersones* during its operations under the Bareboat Charter.19\n\nFour-Party Agreement, 11 October 1999 (Ex. R-4).\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29)\n\n*See* Bareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29); *see* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 74, n. 44.\n\nTrustee Contract, 11 October 1999 (Ex. C-32).\n\nCrewing Contract, 11 October 1999 (Ex. C-33).\n\n40.\n\nA letter dated 17 November 1999 from Mr. Chernykh, Deputy Leader of the Committee, to Mr. Illarionov, Rector of KMTI, captioned \"Concerning the approval of the conditions of the Bareboat charter of the STS KHERSONES,\" states that, having \"examined the project of the charter-party,\" the Committee \"has no objections against the scheme of the financing of the repair and the rebuilding of the STS 'KHERSONES', which was suggested by the institute, with the approval of the conditions of the Bareboat charter with regard to the STS 'KHERSONES'.\"20\n\nLetter from Mr. Chernykh to Mr. Illarionov, 17 November 1999 (Exhibit C-28).\n\n41.\n\nIn connection with the Bareboat Charter scheme, the Inmaris Companies also entered into various contracts governing relations among themselves. These intra-Inmaris contracts are:\n\n\u2022 *Sub-Bareboat Charter Contract* between WKG and IWC, dated 28 December 1999, pursuant to which WKG subcontracted to IWC its charter rights under the Bareboat Charter Contract with KMTI, in exchange for an annual charter hire (payment) of DM 360,000 per year to WKG.21\n\n\u2022 *General Agency Contract* between IWC and IPS, dated 3 January 2000, pursuant to which IPS was to carry out marketing, bookings, customer service, and all operational management of the vessel on IWC's behalf.22 This contract was apparently replaced by the two contracts next listed below when IWS was formed and inserted into the intra-Inmaris contractual structure in 2001/2002.\n\n\u2022 *General Agency Contract* between IWC and IWS, which Claimants contend was first concluded \"in 2001\" and subsequently replaced by another version of the contract dated 20 December 2002.23 Under this contract, IWS was authorized by IWC to market and collect the revenues for the travel tours on the *Khersones*, and to handle the technical and nautical management of the ship outside Ukraine, which services IWS was to perform in exchange for 35% of the sales revenues of each summer sailing season.\n\n\u2022 *Agency Contract* between IWS and IPS, which Claimants contend was first concluded \"in 2001\" and subsequently replaced by another version of the contract dated 20 December 2002.24 Under this contract, IPS was in turn engaged by IWS to carry out advertising, bookings and customer service for the travel tours on the *Khersones*, which services IPS was to perform in exchange for an annual license fee (23,750 euro) and 45% of IWS's gross revenues.\n\nSub-Bareboat Charter Contract, 28 December 1999 (Ex. C-34).\n\nGeneral Agency Contract, 3 January 2000 (Ex. C-83).\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 83, n. 54; General Agency Contract, 20 December 2002 (Ex. C-35). In Claimants' Rejoinder, however, Claimants state that \"[i]t is correct that new contracts between IWC and IWS and between IWS and IPS were concluded only in 2002\" and that until that time, \"IWS acted as general agent for IPS.\" Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdictional Objections, 6 July 2009 (\"Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction\") at para. 63. Ultimately, the precise date (2001 v. 2002) of IWS's insertion into the contractual structure of the Inmaris Companies is not dispositive, as there is no question that IWS was part of that structure as of April 2006.\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 84, n. 55; Agency Contract, 20 December 2002 (Ex. C-36). The same ambiguity exists for the date of the IWS-IPS Agency Contract as for the IWC-IWS General Agency Contract discussed in footnote 23 above; again, however, the precise date of the Agency Contract is ultimately not relevant to the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n42.\n\nClaimants maintain that, in the end, this series of contracts resulted in IPS \"essentially carry[ing] out the business it had carried out before the reconstruction and the setting-up of the Bareboat Charter contractual structure.\"25 A simplified diagram of the eventual contractual relationships is set out below:\n\nMeanwhile, the payment streams associated with this eventual contractual structure are understood to be as follows:\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 86.\n\n43.\n\nClaimants contend that these intra-Inmaris contracts were foreshadowed in the Four-Party Agreement, and therefore known (at least in concept) to KMTI. Section IV of the Four-Party Agreement states that WKG and IWC \"shall enter into a time charter,\" and Section V states that IWC and IPS \"shall enter into a new general agency agreement... in accordance with which [IPS] shall be obliged to arrange for tourist travels onboard sailing vessel and to sell those tours at the tourist market, and to maintain the Vessel on a fiduciary basis, and to render, in this respect, appropriate services to KMTI.\"26\n\nFour-Party Agreement, 11 October 1999 (Exhibit R-4).\n\n44.\n\nRespondent contends that it was essentially unaware of, and until this arbitration had never seen, these contracts.27 In particular, Respondent notes (and Claimants do not contest) that the insertion of IWS into the intra-Inmaris contractual structure between IWC and IPS was not and could not have been foreseen in the Four-Party Agreement, as IWS did not exist at the time of that contract. Claimants contend that IWS's role was at least tacitly accepted by KMTI in that KMTI was advised of IWS's existence in other capacities,28 and KMTI signed various financial accounts that mentioned or were signed by IWS.29\n\n*See, e.g.*, Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 40.\n\nRecord documents indicate that KMTI (i) was advised that IWS had replaced IPS as the General Partner of WKG as of 21 December 2001, *see* Letter from WKG to KMTI, 22 December 2001 (Ex. C-9), and (ii) was notified, and confirmed receipt by counter-signature, that under the Basic Contract, IWS was authorized to act as the general agent of IPS, *see* Confirmation, December 2001 (Ex. R-32). Neither document, however, constitutes notice to KMTI of the conclusion of agency contracts between IWC and IWS and between IWS and IPS.\n\n*See, e.* g., Akte 2002 No. 2 (Ex. C-59); Addendum to Akte 2004 (Ex. C-63); Notice of Investments, 31 December 2004 (Ex. C-64); *cf*. Akte 2003 (unsigned, referencing IWS) (Ex. C-61).\n\n**D. Operations in 1999-2006**\n------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe parties are divided as to whether, following the execution of the Bareboat Charter and its related contracts, the Inmaris Companies and KMTI operated pursuant to the Bareboat Charter scheme, or continued to operate under the Basic Contract. While this legal question is disputed, the facts of the operations largely are not.\n\n46.\n\nThe *Khersones* was reconstructed principally at the TRAL shipyard in Kerch, Ukraine in the first quarter of 2000. That reconstruction was carried out pursuant to a contract signed by TRAL, IPS (as Trustee for KMTI), KMTI, and WKG and dated 18 December 1999.30 Claimants' accounting expert Mr. Senogles states that he reviewed eight bank transaction notices documenting payments from IPS's trust account to the TRAL shipyard totaling more than DM 700,000.31\n\nContract No. *Khersones* I/99, 18 December 1999 (Ex. C-37).\n\nReport of Geoffrey Senogles of LBC International, 20 March 2009, at paras. 56-57 (Ex. C-41).\n\n47.\n\nThe reconstructed *Khersones* was operated by the Inmaris Companies, apparently without incident, between 2000 and 2004. As they had in prior years under the Basic Contract, KMTI and Inmaris representatives met approximately annually to review the prior year's financial results, which meetings resulted in the signature of annual accounts (referred to as \"Akte\").32\n\n*See* Akte 1999 (Ex. C-55); Akte 2000 (Ex. C-56); Akte 2001 (Ex. C-57); Akte 2002 (Ex. C-58); Akte 2002 No. 2 (Ex. C-59); Akte 2002 No. 3 (Ex. C-60); *cf.* Akte 2003 (unsigned) (Ex. C-61); Akte 2004 (unsigned) (Ex. C-62).\n\n48.\n\nClaimants contend that the relationship \"changed to the worse\" following Ukraine's change of government after the March 2005 Orange Revolution.33 Claimants' witnesses testify that in 2005, the Ministry questioned the parties' contracts and refused to permit the *Khersones* to sail until after IPS agreed to provide a EUR 50,000 non-repayable loan to KMTI, and refused to permit the signing of the 2003 and 2004 annual accounts.34\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 100.\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 100, citing witness statements of Messrs. Gohring, Vinnov, and Kolodiazhny (Exhibits C-WS 3, 9, 4).\n\n49.\n\nIn early 2006, various meetings took place between representatives of Respondent and the Inmaris Companies. It is undisputed that on 5 April 2006, the Minister of Agricultural Policy of Ukraine sent a government telegram prohibiting the *Khersones* \"from leaving the borders of the territorial waters of Ukraine until clarification of the matters, as related to its joint operation.\"35 This prevented the *Khersones* from making a scheduled departure from Kerch on 7 April 2006 for the 2006 summer sailing season. Claimants never regained control of the *Khersones* after that date, and ultimately proceeded to file their claims in this arbitration.\n\nGovernmental Telegram, 5 April 2006 (Exhibit R-2).\n\n**III. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nBefore proceeding to consider Respondent's various objections to this Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear Claimants' claims, it will be helpful to address certain general considerations that guide the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**A. Relevant Texts**\n---------------------\n\n51.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent's actions violate multiple provisions of the Germany-Ukraine BIT. Accordingly, to assess its jurisdiction to hear these claims, the Tribunal must turn first of all to the BIT itself.\n\n52.\n\nArticle 11 of the BIT states (in translation) that \"[d]ivergencies with regard to investments between either Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party,\" if they cannot be settled amicably within a period of six months, \"shall be subjected to arbitration proceedings at the request of the national or the company of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n53.\n\nArticle 11(4) of the BIT states that if both Contracting Parties have become Parties to the ICSID Convention, then such disputes shall be subject to arbitration proceedings within the framework of the ICSID Convention (absent an agreement otherwise between the parties to the dispute). As both the Federal Republic of Germany and Ukraine are now Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, and no contrary agreement has been reached by the parties, that eventuality applies here. Inasmuch as the ICSID Convention governs this dispute, the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention also delimit this Tribunal's jurisdiction. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides, in pertinent part,\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre...\n\n54.\n\nThe BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention constitute the applicable law for deciding questions of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. In considering such questions, rules of international law, including the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 and, in particular, the principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Articles 31-33 thereof, may appropriately be invoked. Likewise, points of relevant domestic law may inform the Tribunal's jurisdictional analysis, but its conclusions must ultimately be reached under the BIT and the ICSID Convention themselves.36\n\nThe Tribunal notes, on the other hand, that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention will be relevant if the Tribunal finds jurisdiction and proceeds to the merits of Claimants' claims. *See* Christoph H. Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY at pp. 551-52 (2nd ed. 2009).\n\n55.\n\nAt various points in their pleadings, the parties have drawn the Tribunal's attention to the decisions of other tribunals in other investment treaty arbitrations in support of their respective arguments. It is beyond question that that each Tribunal has its own mandate and competence, and that the decisions of prior tribunals in other cases are not binding on us in any respect. Nevertheless, this Tribunal finds it appropriate to consider the reasoning of and conclusions reached by such tribunals, and to assess whether they may be persuasive in the particular circumstances presented in the case before us. Where appropriate, with a view to the reasoned development of investment law, we may also undertake to explain how or why we concur with or diverge from the decisions reached by other tribunals on questions that may appear similar to the ones that we face.\n\n**B. Factual Findings at the Jurisdictional Stage**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nInasmuch as this case proceeded directly to a separate proceeding on jurisdiction, the Tribunal has before it only limited pleadings and evidence as to the facts underlying the claims, to the extent that the parties have seen fit to present them at this stage. For the most part, the factual development of the case is properly deferred to the proceedings on the merits, in the event that the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over any of the claims. This derives from the oft-stated proposition that, for purposes of determining whether a claimant has stated a BIT claim over which the tribunal has jurisdiction, the tribunal should consider whether the facts alleged by the claimant, if proven, could give rise to a violation of the Treaty.37\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)* (Separate Opinion of Judge Rosalyn Higgins), 1996 I.C.J. 803, 856, at para. 32.\n\n57.\n\nThere are certain respects, however, in which the Tribunal must proceed to decide factual issues at this jurisdictional stage of the proceedings. That is, the Tribunal cannot in all circumstances assume the facts as alleged by Claimants to be true in order to decide on its jurisdiction. At the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction to hear the merits of the dispute. This requires the Tribunal to make definitive findings of any facts that are directly determinative of its jurisdiction.\n\n58.\n\nThe BIT and the ICSID Convention both contain specific, threshold jurisdictional requirements that must be satisfied in order for the Tribunal to determine conclusively that it has jurisdiction. Where the Tribunal's jurisdiction with respect to threshold requirements of the Treaty or ICSID Convention turns on the existence (or absence) of certain disputed facts, the Tribunal cannot merely take Claimants' factual allegations as true and wait until the merits stage to ascertain whether those facts are established. Such disputed facts must be proven at the jurisdictional stage, so that the Tribunal can make a definitive determination of its own jurisdiction. If the evidence is insufficient to ascertain the facts, the Tribunal can choose to join the jurisdictional determination to the merits stage for further development of the evidence\u2014but it cannot determine that it has jurisdiction on a *pro tempore* basis, without assuring itself that the necessary facts are proven.38\n\n*See Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, at paras. 149, 155; *Ioan Micula et al. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, at para. 66; *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, at paras. 59, 61-62.\n\n59.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal may well proceed to weigh the evidence and make factual findings at this stage, though it will do so solely to the extent necessary to make the conclusive jurisdictional determinations required under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n**IV. RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nRespondent in its Memorial on Jurisdiction articulated its objections to this Tribunal's jurisdiction under five headings: (i) Claimants' contracts do not qualify as investments under the BIT; (ii) the alleged investments have not been shown to have been made \"in the territory\" of Ukraine under the BIT; (iii) Claimants' contracts do not constitute investments out of which the dispute directly arises under the ICSID Convention; (iv) the alleged investments do not comprise a significant contribution to Ukraine's development under the ICSID Convention; and (v) IWS and IWC are not proper Claimants, because neither ever had any contractual relationship with any Ukrainian party that might give rise to claims to performance. In its Reply on Jurisdiction, Respondent identified under a separate heading a sixth jurisdictional objection that (vi) the alleged investments were not made in accordance with Ukrainian law either with respect to the content of the Bareboat Charter or the structure of the payment arrangements thereunder.39\n\nRespondent included in its Memorial several arguments to the effect that aspects of the Inmaris contracts were inconsistent with Ukrainian legal requirements, but had not addressed them separately. *See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections, 23 January 2009 (\"Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction\") at paras. 31-44. Respondent in its Reply withdrew one such objection (namely, that the Bareboat Charter had not been approved by the requisite Ukrainian authorities), but added new objections based on the structure of the payments under the Bareboat Charter and the Donation Contract. *See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 254, 249-53.\n\n61.\n\nOf these objections, the first\u2014that Claimants' alleged investments do not qualify as such under the BIT\u2014has been most extensively developed in the parties' pleadings and at the hearing before the Tribunal on jurisdiction. It is also substantially interrelated with the third, fifth, and sixth objections. Respondent's principal contention in this respect is that the Bareboat Charter Contract, which is at the core of Claimants' alleged investments, is a \"fictitious\" agreement, because the parties did not intend it actually to operate as a lease and instead proceeded in their interactions as if they were still operating under the Basic Contract of 1996. On this basis, Respondent contends that Claimants cannot have investments in the form of \"claims to performance\" under a fictitious\u2014and therefore invalid\u2014agreement, nor under any related agreements (objection (i)). Respondent in turn contends that, absent valid claims to performance that could be affected by Respondent's actions in April 2006, this dispute cannot be said to arise directly out of an investment (objection (iii)). Moreover, because in its view the Bareboat Charter Contract is fictitious, Respondent contends that any alleged investments based on rights under the Bareboat Charter or related contracts were not made in accordance with Ukrainian law (objection (vi)). From these premises, Respondent also rejects the claimed investments of other Inmaris companies such as IWC and IWS that are ancillary to the Bareboat Charter Contract (objection (v)). As this issue of the validity of the Bareboat Charter Contract is at the forefront, and pervades the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, it will be addressed first, and synthetically, in Section IV.A below.\n\n62.\n\nRespondent's remaining objections will be taken up in turn in the Sections that follow. Section IV.B will address Respondent's objection that the claimed investments were not made in the territory of Ukraine (objection (ii)). Section IV.C will take up Respondent's contention that the claimed investments do not constitute a significant contribution to its economic development (objection (iv)). In Section IV.D, the Tribunal will address Respondent's additional objections that the claimed investments were not made in accordance with the laws of Ukraine (objection (vi)) (the primary objection (vi) based on the alleged invalidity of the Bareboat Charter Contract having been addressed already in Section IV.A).\n\n**A. Investments Premised on the Bareboat Charter Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIt is appropriate to turn first to the BIT's definitions. Article 2 of the BIT provides that \"[i]nvestments, which have been undertaken by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the legal regulations of a Contracting Party in the field of application of its legal system, shall enjoy the full protection of the Treaty.\"\n\n64.\n\nAlthough Respondent questioned the sufficiency of Claimants' German documentation in its Memorial,40 upon Claimants' production of corporate registry excerpts in its Counter-Memorial,41 Respondent appears to no longer question that the Claimant companies are all \"companies of the other Contracting Party\" for purposes of the BIT.42\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 10-11.\n\n*See* Claimants' Exhibits C-7 (IPS), C-8 (WKG), C-10 (IWC), C-11 (IWS).\n\nArticle 1(4) defines \"companies\" in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany as \"any juridical person as well as any commercial or other company, association with or without legal character, having its seat in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany.\"\n\n65.\n\nRespondent does, however, challenge that each of those Claimant companies had undertaken \"investments\" within the meaning of the BIT. Article 1(1) provides, in pertinent part, that\n\nThe term 'investment' shall comprise all kinds of assets, in particular:\n\n(b) Shares in companies and other kinds of participations in companies;\n\n(c) Claims to money which has been used to create a material or intangible value or claims to any performance having an economic value;\n\n**1. The Bareboat Charter Contract**\n------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nWhile Claimants list multiple alleged investments on behalf of each Claimant company, the majority of the investments are interwoven around Claimants' various direct or derivative rights under the Bareboat Charter Contract, which Claimants characterize as the source of \"claims to performance\" for purposes of Article 1(1) of the BIT.43\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 140-177; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at paras. 126-139.\n\n67.\n\nRespondent does not contest that a contract such as the Bareboat Charter Contract could give rise to claims to performance constituting a covered investment under the BIT. Rather, Respondent's principal objection is that this Bareboat Charter Contract (as well as contracts derivative of it) cannot give rise to \"claims to performance\"\u2014and hence cannot constitute the basis of an investment, whether for WKG or for others of the Inmaris Companies\u2014because it is a fictitious contract. Respondent contends that the Bareboat Charter Contract may well have been entered into for the purpose of obtaining financing for the reconstruction of the *Khersones*, but that, at the same time, it was \"entered into without the parties even intending for it to establish legal consequences\"\u2014specifically, the legal consequences of a charter or lease-type arrangement.44\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 24.\n\n68.\n\nAs evidence of the contract's fictitious nature, Respondent pointed first to the alleged absence of any documented \"delivery\" of the *Khersones* to WKG under the Bareboat Charter Contract, and to the absence of any payments having been made directly to KMTI under the Bareboat Charter Contract.45 Respondent additionally cited the testimony of various witnesses, including testimony of Claimants' witnesses elicited at the hearing, to the effect that, as a practical matter, the parties operated in essentially the same manner that they did under the Basic Contract of 1996.46 Respondent's fundamental contention is thus that \"the Bareboat Charter did not apply to the operation of the *Khersones*\" and that the *Khersones* instead \"was operated on the basis of the formally suspended Basic Contract.\"47\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 26-30.\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 97-104 (citing witness statements of Claimants' witnesses Mr. Illarionov, Mr. Kolodyazhnyi, and Mr. Vinnov, and Respondent's witness Ms. Poltavseva); Respondent's Post Hearing Brief on Jurisdiction, 1 September 2009 (\"Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief\") at paras. 16, 19 (citing testimony of Claimants' witnesses Mr. Kolodyazhnyi, Mr. Illarionov, and Capt. Sukhina).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief at paras. 33, 38.\n\n69.\n\nThe Bareboat Charter Contract is governed \"by English law, if it (law) does not come into contrary with Ukrainian law (material and procedural).\"48 Neither party has offered any briefing on English law, such as whether or how English law recognizes or applies the concept of a fictitious contract.49 Respondent does cite Article 58 of the 1963 Civil Code of Ukraine, which provides that \"[a] transaction shall be void when it has been entered into for the sake of form, without intention to create any legal effect (a fictitious transaction).\"50 Apart from this quotation, however, Respondent has provided no further explanation as to the meaning, jurisprudence, or application of this Civil Code provision under Ukrainian law. Claimants likewise provide no guidance under English or Ukrainian law, merely asserting (without citation) that \"[t]he essential characteristic of a fictitious agreement is that both parties do not intend it to have legal consequences, e.g. where the parties formally conclude contract A, but covertly agree on contract B to govern their relationship.\"51 Accordingly, the Tribunal is left to assess Respondent's objection on its face.\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) at Addendum 1, clause 28 (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\nOn the Tribunal's own research, English law appears to comprise related concepts, such as defects in contract formation where the parties do not intend to create *bona fide* legal relations, or sham contracts intended to deceive third parties. *See, e.g., Glatzer & Warwick Shipping Co v Bradston Ltd (The Ocean Enterprise)*, [1997] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 449, 485; *Snook v London & West Riding Investment Ltd* [1967] 2 QB 786, 802 (per Diplock LJ). Not surprisingly, it appears that the burden of establishing that an express agreement of a commercial nature was *not* intended to create legal relations lies with the party that asserts that no legal effect was intended, and the burden is a heavy one. *See Edwards v Skyways Ltd* [1964] 1 W.L.R. 349, 355 (per Scrutton LJ).\n\nCivil Code of the Ukrainian SSR, 1963 (excerpts) (Ex. R-8).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at para. 47.\n\n70.\n\nBefore turning to the question of the allegedly fictitious nature of the Bareboat Charter Contract, the Tribunal notes that it is not necessarily the case, as Respondent would have it, that Claimants' status as investors will disappear if we agree with Respondent on this issue. It may be that, even if the Bareboat Charter Contract were considered to be fictitious, the Claimants (or at least some of them) would still have standing as investors with claims against Respondent under the Treaty.\n\n71.\n\nFor example, if the Bareboat Charter Contract were deemed fictitious, it would presumably be treated as void *ab initio*.52 Were that the case, however, then the Basic Contract would never have been suspended.53 (Article III(1) of the Four-Party Agreement provides that the application of the Basic Contract \"shall be suspended for the period of duration of the Bareboat Charter\";54 absent a valid Bareboat Charter, Article III(1) is presumably inoperative.) In turn, the Basic Contract\u2014the validity of which Respondent has not challenged\u2014had a term of eight years (*i.e.* to 30 November 2004), with an automatic two-year extension (*i.e.* to 30 November 2006) absent notice from either party.55 Accordingly, the Basic Contract would have been in effect\u2014and thereby at least capable of giving rise to a \"claim to performance\"\u2014at the time of the alleged arrest of the *Khersones* in April 2006. On this basis, even if the Bareboat Charter Contract were deemed fictitious and therefore void, at least IPS\u2014the party to the Basic Contract\u2014arguably would have the requisite investment on which to ground a claim under the Treaty.\n\n*See* Civil Code of the Ukrainian SSR, 1963, at Art. 58 (Ex. R-8) (stating that a fictitious transaction \"shall be void\"); Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 79, n. 177 (stating that a fictitious agreement \"is void\").\n\nRespondent characterized the situation differently: According to Respondent, the Bareboat Charter Contract did serve to suspend the Basic Contract, notwithstanding the fact that in Respondent's view the Bareboat Charter Contract was fictitious and therefore void. Respondent repeatedly characterized the parties as having operated on the basis of \"the formally suspended 1996 Basic Contract\" (*see, e.g.,* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at paras. 15, 16, 98; Transcript, 20 July 2009 (Shemelin) at 8:9-13). Rather than explaining how a fictitious and void contract could have legal consequences (*i.e.* suspension) upon another contract, Respondent \"respectfully [left] this contractual confusion to be resolved by the Tribunal.\" Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 15; *see also id.* at para. 99 (\"This contractual puzzle is respectfully left for the Arbitral Tribunal to resolve.\"). The Tribunal is puzzled only by the apparent internal inconsistency of Respondent's position: it seems to overlook the basic alternatives that either the Bareboat Charter Contract had legal consequences (such as the suspension of the Basic Contract), or it was fictitious and did not have such consequences (and the Basic Contract remained operative).\n\nFour-Party Agreement, 11 October 1999, at Art. III(1) (Ex. R-4).\n\nThere is no record of any such notice having been given. To the contrary, IPS and KMTI on 20 October 2004 signed Addendum No. 2 to the Basic Contract extending its term to 31 December 2010. *See* Addendum No. 2 to Basic Contract, 20 October 2004 (Ex. R-26). A Protocol was then signed on 27 March 2005 suspending the operation of Addendum No. 2 \"[i]n connection with necessity of discussion of the existing arrangements on operation of STS ' *Khersones* '.\" Protocol to Addendum No. 2 to Basic Contract, 27 March 2005 (Ex. R-27). Claimants maintain that this refers to the \"existing arrangements\" under the Bareboat Charter Contract, pursuant to which the Basic Contract was suspended, and that the parties sought to make clear through the Protocol that the extension under Addendum No. 2 was similarly suspended (*i.e.* that Addendum No. 2 did not somehow undo the tolling of the Basic Contract's duration during the operative period of the Bareboat Charter Contract). *See* Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at paras. 40-41. The Tribunal need not, and does not, make any finding at this stage on the total duration of the Basic Contract; for the point noted above, it suffices to note that, absent suspension by the Bareboat Charter Contract, the Basic Contract even on its original terms would still have been in effect in April 2006.\n\n72.\n\nReturning to the status of the Bareboat Charter Contract, the Tribunal takes it to be common ground between the parties, particularly in the wake of the testimony at the hearing, that, in practice, the day-to-day operations of the *Khersones* were not much changed following the execution of the Bareboat Charter Contract, as compared with the parties' prior interactions under the Basic Contract. But that fact, to which Respondent attaches great significance, does not dispositively establish that the Bareboat Charter Contract was fictitious, *i.e.* entered into without any intention to create any legal consequences.\n\n73.\n\n*First*, there is one way in which the operations were very much changed: the *Khersones* was extensively repaired and upgraded, making it more marketable and seaworthy. Respondent does not appear to contest that that development was funded by WKG,56 and the Tribunal is persuaded that the Bareboat Charter was necessary to that arrangement. As Respondent itself flagged in its Reply, \"the Rector of the KMTI, who signed the Bareboat Charter, definitely indicates that the purpose of entering into this Contract was to obtain financing.\"57\n\nRespondent asserts that payments by \"IPS/WKG\" to the TRAL shipyard \"may not be equated with a charter payment under the Bareboat Charter\"\u2014that is, it contends that the fact that IPS/WKG paid for the repairs is not proof that they were doing so pursuant to the Bareboat Charter, or that the Bareboat Charter payment was made into IPS's trust account\u2014but Respondent does not appear to contest that IPS and/or WKG actually paid for the reconstruction and repair work. *See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 121; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 22.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 100 (quoting witness statement of Mr. Illarionov that \"[t]he Bareboat Charter was required only in order to obtain such financing,\" Ex. C-WS2, at para. 17).\n\n74.\n\nOf course, Respondent went on to infer from the Rector's statement that the purpose of the Bareboat Charter was \"*i.e.* not to operate the vessel.\"58 But the existence of one purpose does not necessarily negate another, coexisting purpose. The Bareboat Charter Contract may well have been motivated by the need to obtain financing, but if that financing in turn required that the vessel be secured under a long-term charter to provide security for the income stream for repayment of the financing, then the Bareboat Charter Contract could have the purpose of a charter as well. Moreover, the Bareboat Charter Contract contains multiple *Khersones* -specific terms referring to the vessel's operations,59 which suggest that the parties were concerned with its operational effects as well as its financing effects.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 100 (emphasis omitted).\n\nClause 29 of Addendum 1 states that \"The Parties understand that management and operation of the Vessel shall not be put ahead [of] cadetts training, so the Charterers shall be limited by the s[c]hedules of cadett-exchange determined by the Parties annually in advance.\" Clause 30 states that \"Relations between the Parties and the Master, offices and crew of the Vessel shall be regulated by the special crewing contract, which the Parties shall sign.\" *See* Bareboat Charter Contract STS \"Khersones\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29). Respondent does not appear to dispute that Addendum 1 was subject to the Committee's 17 November 1999 approval of the Bareboat Charter Contract (though it raises questions about Addendum 2). *See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 254-55.\n\n75.\n\nRespondent's position that the Bareboat Charter Contract was not intended to have legal consequences contains an inherent contradiction. On the one hand, Respondent concedes\u2014indeed, even insists\u2014that the Bareboat Charter was intended to make it possible to obtain financing for the *Khersones* ' reconstruction, and it acknowledges that the financing was obtained and the reconstruction was performed. On the other hand, it maintains that the Bareboat Contract was not intended to have legal consequences. In effect, Respondent maintains that the financing and reconstruction of the *Khersones*, and repayment of that financing, were not \"legal consequences\" intended by the parties to the Bareboat Charter Contract. However, the financing and repayment objective is referenced in Addendum 1 of the Bareboat Charter Contract, in Clause 32, which provides:\n\nAfter 5-year action of this Charter the Owners shall not refuse the Charterers to prolong the Charter period if [it] becomes clear that Charterers obligations before their commanditists,60 members and shareholders, agreed with the Owners, have not been fully executed.61\n\nElsewhere Respondent argued that documentary references to the \"kommandit partnership\" should not be taken as evidence that KMTI's officials were aware of or contemplated dealings with WKG. *See* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 35. The Tribunal finds it difficult to credit this argument, however, given the specificity of the term and the absence of any other \"kommandit partnership\" or \"kommanditists\" anywhere involved in the operation of the *Khersones.*\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29)\n\n76.\n\nMoreover, the financing, reconstruction, and repayment objectives were stated explicitly in the Four-Party Agreement, which is cross-referenced as an \"inalienable part\" of the Bareboat Charter Contract.62 The Four-Party Agreement states, *inter alia*, that:\n\n3. Both KMTI and Inmaris realize the necessity of reequipment and capital repair of the Vessel and undertaking of actions to fund the project.\n\n4. For the said purpose, there has been incorporated Windjammer KG, which shall actually make the funds, as required to make the repairs, available.\n\n\u2026\n\n6. In order to provide for safety and repayment of the funds, as made available by Windjammer KG, the Vessel shall have to be operated and to yield a return.\n\n7. By virtue of the aforesaid, the Vessel shall be chartered, subject to bareboat charter terms, to Windjammer KG.63\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) at Addendum 1, Clause 33 (\"The Parties to this Charter additionally shall conclude the Trustee contract, the Donation contract, and the Four-parties contract which are to be inalienable parts of this Charter.\") (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\nFour-Party Agreement, 11 October 1999 (Ex. R-4).\n\n77.\n\nAccordingly, it is difficult to sustain that the financing and reconstruction of the *Khersones*, and the repayment of the financing to the WKG Kommanditists (investors), were not contemplated \"legal consequences\" of the Bareboat Charter Contract, intended by the parties.\n\n78.\n\n*Second*, the fact that the day-to-day operations of the *Khersones* were largely unchanged is not necessarily inconsistent with the proposition that the parties operated under the Bareboat Charter Contract (rather than the Basic Contract). Indeed, it appears that several provisions of the Bareboat Charter Contract were deliberately designed to mimic the preexisting arrangements. For example, Claimants point to the Crewing Contract, which was anticipated in the Bareboat Charter Contract,64 and which lists the existing crew members and states that \"KMTI undertakes to further deploy the same crew, cadets and number on the ship.\"65 As another example, Clause 29 of Addendum 1 to the Bareboat Charter Contract, which gives primacy to the mission of cadet training, appears to replicate the Basic Contract's provisions that \"[t]he commercial activities shall not impede with the training purposes.\"66\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"Khersones\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) at Addendum 1,Clause 30 (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\nCrewing Contract, 11 October 1999, at Clause I(2) (Ex. C-33).\n\nBasic Contract at Section 3 (Ex. C-21).\n\n79.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal sees the plausibility of Claimants' proposition that the testimony of (non-lawyer) witnesses at the hearing to the effect that they continued to work \"on the basis of\" the Basic Contract after 199967 may be explained by the fact that they were unaware that the Bareboat Charter Contract and related agreements replicated the Basic Contract in many operational respects.68 That is to say, the witnesses\u2014who are not in a position to opine as a legal matter about which contract was effective when\u2014confirmed the continuity of the parties' operations, but perhaps without appreciating that the same operations could be involved under either set of contractual arrangements.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Transcript, 21 July 2009 (Kolodyazhnyi) at 110:15-111:4.\n\n*See* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, 1 September 2009 (\"Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief\") at para. 24; *compare* Transcript, 21 July 2009 (Kolodyazhnyi) at 120:2-12 *with id.* (Kolodyazhnyi) at 121:2-124:14.\n\n80.\n\nOne respect in which the parties agree that the Bareboat Charter did not replicate the Basic Contract is with respect to the annual meetings that were held to review the prior year's financial results and to sign annual accounts. This was required under the 1998 Addendum to the Basic Contract,69 but was not required under the Bareboat Charter Contract. Nevertheless, even after 1999, KMTI and Captain Koch continued to hold such meetings and sign annual accounts. In many cases, Captain Koch was identified as signing the accounts for IPS; in others, he was identified as signing for IWS.70 (Captain Koch was the Managing Director of both companies.) Claimants explain these meetings and the accounts as an effort on the part of the Inmaris Companies to accommodate KMTI's accounting obligations, notwithstanding the absence of any contractual obligation for them to do so under the Bareboat Charter Contract. The Tribunal finds this explanation plausible in light of the apparent overarching objective, seemingly embraced by both Inmaris and KMTI,71 to change as little as possible in their working relationship while under the Bareboat Charter Contract. Again, the Tribunal does not view an effort to minimize operational change as demonstrating that legal changes in the relationship are necessarily fictitious.\n\nAddendum No. 1 to the Basic Contract, at Section 8A(c) (Ex. R-7).\n\n*Compare, e.g.*, Akte 2002 (IPS) (Ex. C-58) *with* Akte 2002 No. 2 (IWS) (Ex. C-59) *and* Akte 2002 No. 3 (IPS) (Ex. C-60); Akte 2003 (titled as accounts of IWS, signed for IPS) (Ex. C-61); Akte 2004 (unsigned, signature block for IPS) (Ex. C-62) *with* Addendum to Akte 2004 (signed, IWS) (Ex. C-63).\n\n*See* Fax from IPS to KMTI, 27 September 1999 (Ex. C-25); Transcript, 21 July 2009 (Illarionov) at 57:18-25.\n\n81.\n\n*Third*, Respondent itself takes the position that the Bareboat Charter Contract had at least one legal consequence: according to Respondent, it did operate (via the Four-Party Agreement) to suspend the application of the Basic Contract.72 If Respondent is held to that position, then it would negate the proposition that the Bareboat Charter Contract \"was...entered into without the parties even intending for it to establish legal consequences\"73\u2014 because, at a minimum, it was intended by the parties to have the legal consequence of suspending the Basic Contract.\n\nArticle III(1) of the Four-Party Agreement provides that the application of the Basic Contract \"shall be suspended for the period of duration of the Bareboat Charter.\" Four-Party Agreement, 11 October 1999, at Art. III(1) (Ex. R-4); *see also* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 23 (\"The operation of the Basic Contract was suspended by the 4-Party Agreement for the period of duration of the Bareboat Charter.\") (emphasis in original). Respondent repeatedly characterized the parties as having operated between 1999 and 2006 on the basis of \"the formally suspended 1996 Basic Contract.\" *See, e.g.,* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at paras. 15, 16, 98; Transcript, 20 July 2009 (Shemelin) at 8:9-13.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 24.\n\n82.\n\n*Fourth*, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the other two factual propositions upon which Respondent relies most heavily to establish that the Bareboat Charter Contract did not operate as such (namely, the alleged lack of documentary \"delivery\" of the *Khersones* under the Bareboat Charter Contract, and the non-receipt by KMTI of a bareboat charter payment)74 have the significance that Respondent would have us attribute to them. As to the former, Claimants concede that there is no document in the record memorializing the legal delivery of the *Khersones* to WKG under the Bareboat Charter Contract. But Respondent's insistence on the need for such a document appears to rest on an untenably strained reading of that contract's provisions. Respondent points to Article II(2), which provides that \"the Vessel shall be properly documented at time of delivery.\"75 However, this provision, which is part of the standard BareCon89 industry form contract language used by the parties, is more naturally read to require that the ship's documents are in order at the time of delivery, than (as Respondent would have it) to require that the act of delivery itself be documented. That ordinary meaning of the provision is also consistent with commentary on the BareCon89 form contract, which in connection with this provision discusses the preparation of documentation such as certificates regarding the ship's seaworthiness and \"Classification and Trading certificates.\"76\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 26-30.\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\n*See* Mark Davis, BAREBOAT CHARTERS at 3.12 (2000) (Ex. C-81).\n\n83.\n\nNor do Claimants contest as a factual matter the latter allegation\u2014that KMTI did not directly receive a charter payment from WKG. Indeed, Claimants do not allege that WKG transferred any funds directly to KMTI under the Bareboat Charter Contract.77 But that does not necessarily mean (as Respondent would have it) that no charter hire payment was made under the Bareboat Charter Contract.78 On its face, item 23 of the Bareboat Charter Contract specifies the \"currency and method of payment\" as \"DM [deutschemarks], Trusty account Messrs. Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Service GmbH,\"79 reflecting the fact that KMTI and IPS simultaneously entered into the Trustee Contract by which IPS was to receive payments on KMTI's behalf and disburse them for the reconstruction of the *Khersones*.80 As noted above, evidence in the record (which Respondent has not contested) indicates that such an IPS trust account existed, and that funds drawn from it were used to pay for the work on the *Khersones*.81 Respondent did complain of a lack of documentary evidence that WKG made the charter payments into the IPS trust account.82 Based on the bank statements of the IPS account furnished by Claimants with their Rejoinder,83 as well as the WKG financial statements reviewed by Mr. Senogles,84 the Tribunal finds the evidence sufficient to establish that WKG did make payment into the IPS trust account in at least the amounts specified in the Bareboat Charter Contract and Donation Contract (DM 1,100,000). Particularly given that KMTI itself agreed to the use of this trustee and trust account structure, the Tribunal simply cannot agree with Respondent's proposition that these payments were not \"actually made to the benefit of the owner of the vessel under the terms of the Bareboat Charter.\"85 Payments to a trust account administered by IPS as trustee for KMTI did \"benefit\" KMTI, regardless of whether KMTI received the funds directly from WKG.86 Likewise, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's alternative contention that \"[t]he fact that other contracts have been used by Inmaris companies for the alleged payments, shows that the Bareboat Charter was not an independent operative contract....\"87 It was the Bareboat Charter itself that specified this payment mechanism.88 In the Tribunal's view, the fact that a payment mechanism identified in the contract was actually used by the parties logically supports the validity or operative effect of the contract.\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 195.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 116.\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999, at item 23 (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\nTrustee Contract, 11 October 1999, at Arts. I & II (Ex. C-32).\n\n*See* para. 46 above.\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 119.\n\n*See* Dresdner Bank AG Statements for Account No. 200 9 510 096 03 of \"Inmaris\" Perestroika Sailing Maritime Service GmbH (with explanatory tables) (Ex. C-77).\n\n*See* Report of Geoffrey Senogles of LBC International, 20 March 2009, at paras. 35-48 (Ex. C-41) (discussing review of WKG audited financial statements showing DM 600,000 capital expense and DM 500,000 in noncapitalized repairs).\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 119.\n\nRespondent contends that this payment structure is also relevant to its jurisdictional objections that the investment was not made in the territory of Ukraine, and that the investment violated Ukrainian law. These aspects of the payment structure are addressed in Sections IV.B and IV.D below.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 116.\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999, at item 23 (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\n84.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Bareboat Charter Contract can give rise to \"claims to performance\" within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT's definition of \"investment.\" At this stage, we express no view as to whether WKG was in fact entitled to performance under the Bareboat Charter Contract, whether any such right to performance was in fact breached, or whether any such breach would in fact establish a claim for breach of the BIT. These are all questions for the merits. It is sufficient at this preliminary, jurisdictional stage that the Tribunal finds that the Bareboat Charter Contract is a viable basis for a claim to performance that constitutes an investment under the BIT, and it is such claims to performance that Claimants have advanced here.\n\n85.\n\nOn the same basis, the Tribunal also concludes that the claims presented constitute a legal dispute arising directly out of the investment (i.e. the claim to performance under the Bareboat Charter Contract) under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Respondent relies principally on the logic that if the Bareboat Charter Contract is fictitious, then it cannot give rise to claims to performance out of which the dispute directly arises. Because the Tribunal does not accept the predicate, this \"arising directly\" objection with respect to the Bareboat Charter Contract falls away as well.89\n\nRespondent appears to accept that if the Bareboat Charter Contract is not held to be fictitious, it could be \"capable of giving rise to a dispute due to the Governmental Telegram of April 5, 2006.\" Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 135; *see also id.* at para. 136 (\"Claimants assert that the Bareboat Charter 'gave WKG an enforceable right against KMTI' due to the legal nature of the Bareboat Charter, which 'is similar to a lease contract.' This might have been so, if the Bareboat Charter had not been a fictitious agreement....\"). The question of \"arising directly\" with respect to contracts other than the Bareboat Charter Contract is discussed in Section IV.A.2 below.\n\n86.\n\nWe also note that Respondent framed the \"arising directly\" inquiry in rather specific terms: whether Claimants had a \"clear, specific and enforceable right to conduct tourist cruises aboard the *Khersones* on or after the date of the alleged 'arrest'\" of the ship (*i.e.*, 6 April 2006).90 Such an inquiry as to the precise scope and import of Claimants' legal rights and whether Respondent violated those rights would be beyond the proper jurisdictional inquiry of Article 25 and would relate to the merits of the parties' dispute. To quote a passage from Professor Schreuer's *Commentary* that Respondent has invoked,91 Article 25 requires that \"the dispute must not only be connected to an investment, but must also be reasonably closely connected.\"92 The Tribunal finds such a \"reasonably close\" connection here, and it need not approach the granular level of analysis that Respondent advocated.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 75 (emphasis omitted); *see also id.* at para. 74 (\"Any other claims to performance which could be based on the Inmaris Contracts generally... do not meet the requirement of directness.\").\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 73.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY at 114 (1st ed. 2001); *see also* Christoph H. Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY at 106 (2nd ed. 2009).\n\n**2. Related Inmaris Contracts**\n--------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn connection with many of its objections, Respondent strenuously urges the Tribunal to examine the specific investments claimed by each individual would-be Claimant under each contract. The Bareboat Charter Contract was signed by only KMTI and WKG, and Respondent maintains that rights claimed derivatively by other Claimants under other contracts are insufficient to ground this Tribunal's jurisdiction with respect to certain of the specific claims and Claimants. Accordingly, while the analysis in the preceding Section IV.A.1 identifies at least one investment sufficient to provide standing for WKG under Article 1(1) of the BIT (subject to Respondent's other jurisdictional objections, discussed in the Sections that follow), it is also necessary to consider whether the other Claimants in this arbitration\u2014namely, IPS, IWC, and IWS\u2014have identified investments upon which jurisdiction can be based under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.93\n\nThis discussion corresponds to aspects of Respondent's first, third, and fifth objections to jurisdiction. *See supra* at para. 60.\n\n88.\n\nWe turn first to these Claimants' alleged investments in the form of \"claims to performance\" under the various contracts related to the Bareboat Charter Contract. Some of these Claimants also lay claim to other investments by virtue of their corporate relationships, addressed in Section IV.A.4 below, and by virtue of their expenditures and expected returns, addressed in Section IV.A.3.\n\n89.\n\nClaimants itemized the alleged investments of each of the Inmaris companies in their Counter-Memorial. IWC's contract-based investments were identified as the Sub-Bareboat Charter and the \"indirectly controlled\" Bareboat Charter.94 IWS's contract-based investments were identified as the 2001 General Agency Contract between IWS and IWC, and, again, the \"indirectly controlled\" Bareboat Charter.95 Finally, IPS's contract-based investments were identified as the 1996 Basic Contract and its \"indirect interest into the ship\" through the 2001 Agency Contract between IPS and IWS.96\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 150.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 157.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 164.\n\n90.\n\nIt is clear from the foregoing list that these purported investments are all substantially derivative of, and removed by increasing degrees from, the Bareboat Charter Contract. As depicted in the charts at paragraph 42 above, WKG in effect sub-leased the *Khersones* to IWC, which in turn made IWS its agent to operate the vessel, which in turn made IPS its agent for the marketing of the vessel. The revenue streams from this operation (*i.e.*, from the tourist bookings) flowed in to IWC, which made an annual sub-bareboat charter payment up to WKG, and paid a portion of its revenues down to IWS, which in turn paid fees down to IPS.\n\n91.\n\nHad the claims in this arbitration been presented only on behalf of one of these companies, relying on \"claims to performance\" or \"claims to money\" under its respective contract(s) in this chain, the Tribunal might have faced difficult questions as to the requisite degree of legal and factual proximity to the underlying investment operations. It might have been necessary to consider factors such as the scope of the various entities' legal rights (*e.g.*, the fact that IWC's legal rights are effectively coterminous with WKG's rights, while IWS and IPS's rights are successively more limited), the degree of direct involvement in the *Khersones* project (*e.g.*, the fact that IWS actually operated the *Khersones* and paid for its operations, while IPS merely marketed the tours), and the degree of integration of the contractual rights (*e.g.*, the fact that the Four-Party Agreement signed by KMTI expressly contemplated a WKG sub-charter to IWC and an IWC general agency contract to another entity, but to IPS not IWS).\n\n92.\n\nIn this case, however, the Tribunal is presented with claims on behalf of all of the Inmaris companies, proceeding jointly, arising out of all of the interrelated contracts relating to the reconstruction and operation of the *Khersones*. Accordingly, the Tribunal can step back to consider their claimed investments as component parts of a larger, integrated investment undertaking. It is not necessary to parse each component part of the overall transaction and examine whether each, standing alone, would satisfy the definitional requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. For purposes of this Tribunal's jurisdiction, it is sufficient that the transaction as a whole meets those requirements. Of course, exactly what rights (if any) were held by each specific company, whether any such specific rights were breached by Respondent's actions, and whether or how such contractual breaches (if any) give rise to breaches of the Treaty, are questions that the Tribunal may need to take up on the merits. But they need not be answered at this stage, where the Tribunal need only determine the existence of a covered investment in the transaction as a whole.\n\n93.\n\nAs Claimants contended,97 and Respondent acknowledged,98 this approach of considering the purported investment in an integrated fashion has been followed by multiple investment treaty tribunals before us. Claimants invoked *CSOB v. Slovakia* (\"[A] dispute that is brought before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment.\");99*Joy Mining v. Egypt* (\"[A] given element of a complex operation should not be examined in isolation because what matters is to assess the operation globally or as a whole....\");100*ADC v. Hungary* (\"In considering whether the present dispute falls within those which 'arise directly out of an investment' under the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is entitled to, and does, look at the totality of the transaction as encompassed by the Project Agreements.\");101 and *Mytilineos v. Serbia* (\"Even if one doubted whether the Agreements looked at in isolation would constitute investments by themselves, [it] seems clear that the combined effect of these agreements amounts to an investment.\").102 One might also take note of the decisions of various ICSID tribunals in contract-based (rather than treaty-based) cases that relied on the overall unity or inseparability of the relevant operation in order to exercise jurisdiction over other related contracts, in addition to the contract containing the consent to ICSID arbitration.103\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 206; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at para. 74.\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 83.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. v.

United Republic of Cameroon*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Award, 21 October 1983, at Part III.\n\n94.\n\nHere, in the Tribunal's view it is clear that the various IWC, IWS, and IPS contracts were integrated with the Bareboat Charter Contract as part of the Claimants' undertaking to renovate and operate the *Khersones*. Whether under the Basic Contract (an investment of IPS), or the Bareboat Charter Contract (an investment of WKG), that was the enterprise in which the Inmaris companies were engaged. We need not be persuaded that it was \"necessary\" for the various Inmaris companies to arrange their respective activities and responsibilities as they did in connection with the Bareboat Charter;104 we need only conclude that each was an integrated part of the *Khersones* project. Even if the financing, the bareboat charter, the sailing tour operations, and the marketing all could have been performed by a single entity (as apparently was the case under the Basic Contract), the fact that Claimants allocated these responsibilities among different Inmaris entities in connection with the Bareboat Charter Contract does not change the essential nature or scope of the *Khersones* venture. Conceptually, this analysis does not allow Claimants to \"create new investment[s]\" through \"sub-delegation,\" as Respondent suggests.105 Rather, it determines that the Claimants' contractual rights, whether they flow directly from KMTI or indirectly via \"sub-delegation\" through another Inmaris company, are part and parcel of the same, integrated investment.\n\n*Cf.* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 69 (contending that Claimants could not \"plausibly explain\" why the multiple contracts were \"necessary for the so-called 'Bareboat Charter Scheme'\").\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 206.\n\n95.\n\nMoreover, most of these various arrangements were spelled out quite clearly in agreements that KMTI signed, which further attest to the integrated nature of the operations. The Four-Party Agreement expressly contemplated both that WKG would sub-charter the *Khersones* to IWC, and that IWC would appoint another entity as its general agent for the operation, maintenance, and marketing of the *Khersones*.106 Consistent with this, the Bareboat Charter Contract also contemplates sub-chartering, in that it provides for the compensation of sub-charterers (among others) if the Contract is cancelled by any third party, government or state authority prior to the end of its term.107\n\nFour-Party Agreement, 11 October 1999, at Preamble (8), Art. IV, Art. V (Ex. R-4).\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) at Addendum 1, Clause 31 (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\n96.\n\nIn addition to highlighting that the ancillary contracts were integrated with the Bareboat Charter, these contractual cross-references make clear that Claimants did not devise their arrangements covertly. The only aspect of the arrangements among the Inmaris companies that was not expressly contemplated in the KMTI-signed contracts in 1999 was that IWC would later divide the operation/maintenance and marketing responsibilities contemplated in Art. V of the Four-Party Agreement between IWS (a new entity in the group) and IPS, respectively. But whether or not KMTI or the State Committee was aware of the details of the Inmaris companies' arrangements *inter se*, is not dispositive. Rather, the question is whether these arrangements can properly be considered to be part of an integrated, unitary operation that comprises an investment over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction. We hold that they do.\n\n97.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, we do not rely on Claimants' references to investment treaty decisions dealing with \"indirect investments,\" cited in support of the proposition that the contract-related investments of IWC, IWS and IPS constitute indirect investments in WKG's own investment under the Bareboat Charter Contract.108 Such cases deal with investments that are \"indirect\" by virtue of chains of corporate ownership.109 For purposes of this analysis, where a network of contractual arrangements is in play, we find it is more appropriate to focus on the requirement of directness under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*See* Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at para. 93.\n\nBITs that do not otherwise restrict the structure of investors' investments are regularly read to encompass investments in the host state that are owned by investors of the home state through one or more levels of subsidiaries, including subsidiaries incorporated in third countries (even when the BITs are silent on the issue). *See, e.g.*, *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, at paras. 130, 136-37; *Gas Natural SDG, S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 June 2005, at paras. 10, 35.\n\n98.\n\nIn this vein, the Tribunal notes that examining the totality of the venture, rather that its component parts in isolation, also resolves Respondent's objections to the claims of IWC, IWS and IPS that were based on the \"arising directly\" requirement under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. It is clear that the dispute placed before us is a legal one that arises directly out of the Inmaris companies' integrated investment in the renovation and operation of the *Khersones*, as based on the Bareboat Charter Contract. We need not determine whether the dispute also arises directly out of each entity's individual rights within that integrated investment. As did the *CSOB*, *Joy Mining*, and *ADC* tribunals,110 we examine whether the dispute arises directly out of the totality of the investment\u2014and we conclude that it does.\n\nSee *CSOB v. Slovakia*, Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 72; *Joy Mining*, Award at para. 54; *ADC v. Hungary*, Award at para. 331.\n\n**3. Payments Made, and Returns Expected, by the Inmaris Companies**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nWith respect to each of the Claimant companies, Claimants identified various payments made by them as also constituting \"investments\" for the purpose of grounding this Tribunal's jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. For example, WKG claimed \"the payments made under the Bareboat Charter and the Donation Contract for the reconstruction of the *Khersones*\" as an investment;111 IWC claimed \"the payments it made into the ship and for the operation of the ship\";112 IWS claimed \"the investments made into the *Khersones*\";113 and IPS claimed \"the payments made for the operation of the ship, for repair and spare parts from 1996 through 1999.\"114 In their Rejoinder, Claimants framed these collectively as \"the payments made for the renovation and operation of the ship, and... the claims for reimbursement of reconstruction and operational expenses\"\u2014all of which Claimants characterized as among their \"investments.\"115\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 140.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 150.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 157.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 164.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at para. 79.\n\n100.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimants' focus on these expenditures is misguided in the context of jurisdictional objections. Claimants appear to be confusing the concept of an \"investment\" that is protected by the BIT (and that is subject to arbitration under the ICSID Convention) with the layman's financial or economic notion of an \"investment\" as money expended in expectation of a return. This may be a function of terminology\u2014the word \"investment\" is common usage in both contexts.\n\n101.\n\nBut the investment that must be identified for purposes of establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction is of a specific kind. Article 1(1) of the BIT provides that \"[t]he term 'investment' shall comprise all kinds of assets....\" Thus, it is necessary to identify an \"asset\" to constitute an investment that is protected by the Treaty (provided all other jurisdictional requirements are met). The payments identified by the Claimants may reflect the contributions they made to obtain, or in furtherance of, investments; indeed, in the vernacular of quantum calculations, they might constitute Claimants' \"amounts invested\" in the financial sense.116 But the payment streams themselves are not necessarily \"investments\" covered by the Treaty. It is the asset acquired by an investor, typically as a result of such payments, that is the investment\u2014 be it tangible, such as an enterprise or real property, or intangible, such as claims to money or claims to performance (as here). Accordingly, the Tribunal does not accept Claimants' contention that their past payments toward the operation or repair of the *Khersones*, as such, constitute investments protected under the Treaty on which this Tribunal's jurisdiction may be founded. This is not to say that such payments will be outside the Tribunal's consideration for other purposes. They are potentially relevant to Respondent's jurisdictional objection that Claimants' investment did not contribute to the economic development of Ukraine (*see* Section \"XIV.C below). At the merits stage, in the event that the Tribunal concludes it has jurisdiction, they may form part of the factual context of Claimants' claims under the Treaty. And they may be relevant to quantum, should the Tribunal find liability. But in the Tribunal's estimation, those payments are not, in and of themselves, protected \"investments\" under the Treaty.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Award, 23 September 2003, at paras. 236-306 (awarding out-of-pocket expenses); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas* *del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, at paras. 8.3.13-8.3.20 (awarding \"investment damages\").\n\n102.\n\nA more complicated picture emerges with respect to Claimants' characterization of their expected returns on their various payments as \"investments.\" WKG claimed an \"investment\" in the form of its expected sub-charter hire payments and expected profits from IWC;117 IWC claimed \"the expected returns from the operation of the ship in 2006 and the years to come\" as an investment;118 and IWS claimed investments in \"its share of the profits of IWC and the sub-bareboat charter, [and] IWC and its investments.\"119 Respondent contends that \"expected or future returns\" are not a \"covered investment\" protected by the BIT.120\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 140. WKG owns 49% of IWC, and anticipated receiving 49% of IWC's profits (in addition to the payments owed by IWC to WKG under the Sub-Bareboat Charter Contract). *See id.* at para. 148.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 150.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 157. As to the former claimed investment (\"share of the profits of IWC and the sub-bareboat charter\"), under the General Agency Contract, IWS's remuneration was set at a percentage of the sales revenues received by IWC for sailing tours during the *Khersones* ' sailing season in each year. *See* General Agency Contract, 20 December 2002, at \u00a73(a) (Ex. C-35). The latter claimed investment (\"IWC and its investments\") is apparently a reference to the fact that IWS owns 51% of IWC, and would therefore expect to receive 51% of the profits earned by IWC.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 57; *see also* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 165, 192-94.\n\n103.\n\nNone of the illustrative examples of investments in Article 1(1) of the BIT directly corresponds to the concept of expected returns as an asset, although as a practical matter such returns are potentially the result of holding an asset. However, at least in the context of expected returns that are grounded in contract, one can fairly readily characterize expectations of payment as \"claims to money\" or \"claims to performance.\" On this basis, the Tribunal accepts WKG's and IWS's characterization of the payments expected under their respective contracts as \"investments\" within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n104.\n\nExpected returns that are *not* directly premised on a contractual right to receive money, such as IWC's claimed investment in \"the expected returns from the operation of the ship in 2006 and the years to come\"121 or WKG and IWS's claimed investments in the profits of IWC,122 do not fit so neatly into Article 1(1)'s parameters. One typically speaks of the returns expected *from* an investment, rather than of expected returns *as* an investment as such. Here, however, the Treaty's provisions make it unnecessary to consider the abstract question whether such returns would fit within a typical BIT definition of \"investment.\"\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 150.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 148, 157.\n\n105.\n\nA Protocol to the BIT agreed upon the Treaty's signing states that \"[w]ith regard to Article 1... [r]eturns from the investment, and, in the event of their reinvestment, the returns therefrom, shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.\"123 Several points about this provision may be noted. *First*, the state parties to the BIT evidently conceive of \"returns\" and \"the investment\" as distinct concepts. This weighs against defining returns (whether past or future) as investments *per se*. *Second*, however, by virtue of the Protocol, the BIT's substantive protections are extended to returns. Thus, even if returns are not in fact within the definition of a covered \"investment,\" returns are nevertheless covered by the BIT, and host state conduct with respect to the returns may give rise to claims under the Treaty.124\n\nBIT Protocol, 15 February 1993, at Art. 1(a) (Ex. C-4).\n\nOn this point, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's contention that this Treaty protection can extend only to already-earned returns and not to future returns. Respondent relied on the definition of \"returns\" in Article 1(2) of the BIT, which refers to \"the amounts yielded by an investment for a definite period as profits, dividends, interest, royalties or other fees.\" Respondent contended that the use of the past tense \"yielded\" necessarily excludes expected or future returns. As a linguistic matter, however, this argument is unavailing: \"yielded\" in this usage permits both past and future readings\u2014 *i.e.* \"amounts that have been yielded,\" or \"amounts that are yielded,\" or \"amounts that will be yielded.\" \"Amounts yielded\" is a grammatical shorthand that (perhaps deliberately) fits both timeframes. The Tribunal reads the ordinary meaning of the BIT Protocol in this manner, in the context of the Protocol's object and purpose of extending the BIT's coverage to returns from investments as well as investments themselves.\n\n106.\n\n*Third*, this Treaty protection for \"returns from the investment\" is predicated on the existence of \"the\" covered investment from which the returns are generated.125 The Protocol could not be stretched to give BIT protection to returns from a transaction that is not an investment (such as, for example, returns on a simple contract for the sale of goods). Accordingly, it is still necessary for the Tribunal to ground its jurisdiction over IWC's, WKG's and IPS's claims on an Article 1(1) investment that is distinct from the returns which may flow from it. The Tribunal has already done so, based on their contractual rights relating to the overall Bareboat Charter investment (*see* Section IV.A.2 above).\n\nBIT Protocol, 15 February 1993, at Art. 1(a) (Ex. C-4).\n\n107.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that, whether or not \"expected returns\" can be defined as an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT, such returns are expressly covered under the BIT by virtue of Article 1(a) of the Protocol. Accordingly they can properly be the basis of claims by IWC, WKG and IPS under the BIT.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that the practical significance of this conclusion should not be overstated. Even if expected returns were not a subject of the BIT's substantive protections\u2014that is, even if one could not advance claims under the BIT for, *e.g.*, expropriation of expected returns, or lack of full protection and security for expected returns\u2014those expected returns could still play a role in the rest of the case. The expected returns could be relevant to questions of liability\u2014for example, in consideration of the claimant's legitimate expectations. If liability were then found, they could be relevant to the calculation of the damages suffered with respect to the underlying investment.\n\n**4. Corporate Structure of the Inmaris Companies**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nIn addition to their claimed investments in the form of contractual rights, payments, and expected returns, certain of the Claimants also lay claim to additional investments by virtue of their corporate relationships. For example, WKG and IWS hold equity stakes in IWC (49% and 51%, respectively), which shareholdings are claimed to be investments in their own right.126\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 148, 157. WKG actually states this as a claim to the \"profits\" of IWC\u2014a claim discussed in Section IV.A.3 above. Because IWS claims an investment in IWC itself, apparently by virtue of its 51% stake, we discuss that claimed investment here\u2014and our reasoning applies equally to WKG as the other 49% shareholder.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in the preceding sub-Sections that each of the Inmaris companies is properly deemed an investor with a stake in the integrated *Khersones* investment. Once that determination has been made, it follows that the owners of those \"investor\" companies will, in turn, also qualify as investors by virtue of that ownership. That is, the owners of IWC, for example, hold indirect investments in that same integrated operation in which IWC is an investor. Notably, however, in the circumstances of this case, such an ownership position is not an independent or distinct basis for identifying an investment; it is necessarily derivative of our prior conclusion that IWC itself qualifies as an investor holding an investment.\n\n111.\n\nThe 49% and 51% shareholdings of WKG and IWS in IWC are the type of asset that meets the definition of an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Article 1(1) includes, in its \"particular\" examples of \"all kinds of assets,\" the category of \"[s]hares in companies, and other kinds of participations in companies.\"127 Thus, the *nature* of WKG and IWS's claimed investments in IWC presents no difficulty as a jurisdictional matter. Whether the claimed investments in IWC satisfy the other jurisdictional requirements (in particular, the territorial requirement) of the BIT will be taken up in the Sections that follow.\n\nTreaty, Art. 1(1)(b).\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, moreover, that the question of whether such corporate holdings constitute covered investments may have little practical significance in this case, given the Tribunal's conclusions with respect to their other claimed investments discussed above. For example, given that the Tribunal has concluded that IWC itself has covered investments (as part of the integrated contract-based investment) and can also rest claims on expected returns, any claims of WKG and IWS as the owners of IWC would be, in effect, derivative of IWC's own claims. Likewise, were the Tribunal to find liability, any damages claims of WKG and IWS would be derivative of IWC's own damages claims, and the Tribunal of course would not permit any double recovery with respect to the quantum awarded (if any).\n\n**B. In the Territory of Ukraine**\n----------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nBoth as to the whole of the Inmaris/ *Khersones* operation, and to the individual investments of the individual Claimants, Respondent contends that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the BIT because the alleged investments were not undertaken or invested in the territory of Ukraine.128\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 59-71; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 234-39. Respondent belatedly added the assertion that the ICSID Convention also imposes a jurisdictional requirement of investment \"in the territory\" of the Respondent state. *See* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 77. Respondent's only support for this proposition was a passing reference in the 1965 Report of the Executive Directors describing the purpose of the ICSID Convention as \"stimulat[ing] a larger flow of private international investment into [a signatory state's] territories.\" Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 18 March 1965, at para. 12. The Tribunal does not find this to be a sufficient basis for the argument that Respondent advances. But because the Tribunal ultimately identifies an adequate territorial nexus in any event (see below), it need not make a definitive determination as to whether such a requirement exists under the ICSID Convention.\n\n114.\n\nThe first question is whether the BIT in fact imposes such a requirement. The Germany-Ukraine BIT does not include an explicit territoriality requirement in the provision of the Treaty that most directly defines the scope of its application: Article 2(2) provides only that \"[i]nvestments, which have been undertaken by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the legal regulations of a Contracting Party in the field of application of its legal system, shall enjoy the full protection of the Treaty.\" Likewise, \"investment\" is not defined in Article 1(1) by reference to the territory in which the investment is made.\n\n115.\n\nOn the other hand, the Treaty includes many other references to investments made \"in the territory\" of the host Contracting Party. Some of these references qualify the Contracting Party's substantive obligations toward investors and investments:\n\n\u2022 Article 2(1) provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall in its territory promote\" and admit investments in accordance with its laws;\n\n\u2022 Article 2(3) bars the Contracting Party from impeding the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment \"of investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party\";\n\n\u2022 Article 3(1) promises that the Contracting Party \"shall treat investments in its territory\" on the basis of national treatment and MFN treatment;\n\n\u2022 Article 3(2) extends national and MFN treatment to the activity of nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party \"in connection with investments in its [ *i.e.*, the host Contracting Party's] territory\";\n\n\u2022 Article 4(1) promises that investments shall enjoy full protection and security \"in the territory\" of the host Contracting Party;\n\n\u2022 Article 4(2) states that investments shall not be expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization \"in the territory of the other [ *i.e.*, the host] Contracting Party\" except for the public benefit and against compensation;\n\n\u2022 Article 4(3) promises national treatment in connection with any restitution when \"[i]nvestments suffer losses in the territory of the other [ *i.e*., the host] Contracting Party\" due to war or other armed conflict;\n\n\u2022 Article 4(4) promises MFN treatment \"in the territory of the other [ *i.e*., the host] Contracting Party\" to nationals or companies of a Contracting Party with respect to matters covered in Article 4 (*e.g.*, full protection and security, expropriation, restitution for losses in the event of war);\n\n\u2022 Article 6 provides for the recognition of subrogation arrangements with respect to \"an investment in the territory of the other [ *i.e*., the host] Contracting Party\";\n\n\u2022 Article 8(2) states the Contracting Party's obligation to \"observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory\" by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\n\n116.\n\nOther provisions of the Treaty also mention investment \"in the territory\" of the Contracting Party. For example, while Article 2(2) on the application of the Treaty does not include such a requirement, Article 9 extending the Treaty's application to investments predating the BIT does so specify: \"This Treaty shall also apply to investments that nationals or companies of either Contracting Party made in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" prior to the BIT's entry into force. In addition, the Treaty's Preamble describes the Contracting Parties as \"intending to create favorable conditions for investments by the citizens or companies of one state in the territory of the other state.\"\n\n117.\n\nWithin this framework, Claimants contend that the Treaty does not include a territorial requirement as a predicate for *jurisdiction*.129 Claimants see the territorial references in the Treaty as specifying conditions under which various of the substantive BIT obligations will or will not apply, but not as limiting the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the investments as such.130\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 180.\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 180 n. 132.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by this line of argument. First, while one could imagine a Treaty that established a territorial requirement for the treaty as a whole in either its definitions or its scope provisions, and could argue that this would be more efficient than repeating the requirement in each of the Treaty's provisions, that is by no means the only way to do so.\n\n119.\n\nSecond, Article 9, which does define the BIT's scope on a temporal basis, includes such a requirement. Article 9 states that the Treaty shall \"also\" apply to investments in the territory made prior to the BIT coming into effect; it would not in any way stretch the Treaty's ordinary meaning then to infer that the Treaty otherwise applies to the same kind of investments (*i.e.* investments in the territory) that are made after the BIT came into effect.\n\n120.\n\nThird, even if an \"in the territory\" requirement did not delimit the Treaty's scope as a whole (and we are inclined to conclude that it does), there *is* such a requirement in several of the substantive BIT protections that Claimants have invoked. In their Request for Arbitration, Claimants charged Respondent with violations of Article 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment), Article 2(3) (arbitrary impairment), Article 4(2) (uncompensated expropriation of an investment, and returns from an investment), and Article 4 as modified by the BIT Protocol, item 4 (intervention by state measures in a business that is the object of an investment).131 At least two of these provisions contain explicit territorial limits: The protection of Article 2(3) is limited to \"investments in [the] territory\" of the host Contracting Party, and Article 4(2) applies only to expropriations, etc. \"in the territory\" of the host Contracting Party.132 The Tribunal needs to determine whether the investment was made in the territory of Ukraine in order to ensure that Claimants' claims as stated are within these provisions' scope. Otherwise, the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction to resolve claims for breaches of these provisions.\n\nClaimants' Request for Arbitration at para. 48.\n\nIt is arguable, but not explicit on the face of the provision, that Article 2(1)'s fair and equitable treatment provision is also covered by an \"in the territory\" requirement. Article 2(1) contains two sentences\u2014the first promises that each Contracting Party \"in its territory\" shall promote and admit investments in accordance with its laws; the second states that the Contracting Party shall \"in any case\" accord investments fair and equitable treatment. The second sentence (under which Claimants' claim is advanced) does not mention a territorial limit. However, its linkage to the first sentence (*i.e.*, the phrase \"in any case\" apparently drawing a contrast with the first sentence) permits an argument that the territorial limit of the first sentence should be read into the second sentence as well. Given our conclusion with respect to the territorial nexus of Claimants' investments below, we need not definitively resolve this question. Even if the fair and equitable treatment provision were read as incorporating a territorial requirement, the analysis by which we identify a territorial nexus for purposes of Articles 2(3) and 4(2) would be equally applicable to Article 2(1).\n\n121.\n\nThus, whether we treat the BIT as including a territoriality requirement as an overarching jurisdictional limit, or as including territorial limits among the elements of the substantive protections that underlie Claimants' claims, the Tribunal must inquire into the territorial nexus of Claimants' investments at this stage. The only difference will be the standard of review that we apply to the relevant facts, as discussed in Section III.B above. If a territorial nexus is a requirement for the Treaty's application as a whole, we must determine definitively that the requisite nexus exists. If the territorial nexus is merely an element of one or more substantive claims, we need only determine that the Claimants have alleged sufficient facts that, if proven, could establish the requisite nexus. As we will discuss next, Claimants' investments meet the former, more exacting standard; the undisputed facts (and our factual findings to the extent the facts are disputed) establish that the requisite territorial link is present here. Accordingly, we need not decide the exact nature of the BIT's territorial requirement, because either standard of review would be satisfied.\n\n122.\n\nRespondent contended that Claimants' investments, whether viewed collectively or individually, were not undertaken in the territory of Ukraine. Respondent contended that, with respect to investments in the form of \"claims to performance,\" funds must be injected into Ukraine for works or services provided in Ukraine, out of which would arise an entitlement to performance, also in Ukraine.133 In Respondent's view, none of these requirements has been met. As support, Respondent alleges, *inter alia*, that Claimants did not perform services in Ukraine, their expenditures on the *Khersones* have not been shown to have been made in Ukraine, the various intra-Inmaris contracts did not involve any Ukrainian parties or any injection of funds into Ukraine, IWC and IWS have never carried out any activity in Ukraine, and WKG's charter hire and donation payments were transferred to IPS in Germany not to KMTI in Ukraine.134\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 60.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 64-71; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 150-51, 156-57, 166, 176, 220, 230.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Respondent's characterization of the territorial requirement is unduly narrow and formalistic. Of course, an injection of funds into the territory of the host State in connection with an investment will typically satisfy the requirement. The Tribunal notes that at least some such injections apparently did occur here: IPS made payment (with funds received from WKG) to the TRAL shipyards, in Kerch, Ukraine, for the repair and renovation of the *Khersones*. But an injection of funds is by no means the only way that an investment may be made in the territory of a host State. The tribunals in *Fedax* *v. Venezuela* and *CSOB v. Slovakia*, for example, each found qualifying investments in circumstances where the investor was not shown to have transferred funds into the host State in question.135 As the *Fedax* tribunal noted, \"[i]t is a standard feature of many international financial transactions that the funds involved are not physically transferred to the territory of the beneficiary, but put at its disposal elsewhere.\"136 We agree with that proposition, and accordingly do not accept Respondent's attempt to impose a stricter interpretation here. Thus, for example, the fact that payments for the reconstruction of the *Khersones* were made by WKG (in Germany) via IPS (in Germany) under the Trustee Contract rather than transferred to KMTI (in Ukraine) does not foreclose the possibility that WKG's investment in the contract rights associated with the reconstructed *Khersones* is nevertheless an investment in the territory of Ukraine.\n\n*See Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997 (\"*Fedax*, Decision on Jurisdiction\") at para. 41; *CSOB v. Slovakia*, Decision on Jurisdiction, at para. 78 (\"[A] transaction can qualify as an investment even in the absence of a physical transfer of funds.\")\n\n*Fedax*, Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 41.\n\n124.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, an investment may be made in the territory of a host State without a direct transfer of funds there, particularly if the transaction accrues to the benefit of the State itself. Here, the benefits of Claimants' investments, considered as an integrated whole, were received by Respondent. It is undisputed that KMTI, a Ukrainian state entity, now owns a substantially renovated sailing vessel for the training of its cadets, which also offers the prospect of revenues from tourist operations. Respondent does not dispute that the funds for such a renovation would otherwise have had to come from the State's coffers, or that the State lacked the financial resources to undertake the renovation. Claimants' expenditures in connection with the *Khersones* created value in Ukraine, on the basis of contractual relationships with a Ukrainian state entity. Accordingly, the Tribunal has little difficulty in concluding that the Claimants' investments are investments in the territory of Ukraine.137\n\nThe Tribunal thus does not rely on Claimants' alternative argument that their investments in the *Khersones*' renovation and operation were made \"in the territory of Ukraine\" because the vessel was Ukrainian-flagged and thus was itself part of \"the territory of Ukraine\" even when sailing in foreign or international waters. *See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 182-84. This strikes the Tribunal as a potentially quite far-reaching proposition, and it is not a basis for the Tribunal's finding of a sufficient territorial nexus in this case.\n\n125.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal is mindful of, but not persuaded by, Respondent's contention that each individual claimed investment of each Claimant company must be separately examined to determine whether it was undertaken in the territory of Ukraine. As already discussed, the Tribunal views the various inter-Inmaris relationships as merely the means by which Claimants implemented their collective investment in the rights to operate and market the renovated *Khersones* under the Bareboat Charter Contract. The division of labor among the Claimants does not affect the nature of the integrated investment in which they participated. Likewise, it does not affect the fact that the investment as a whole was ultimately undertaken in relation to property belonging to the Ukrainian state, and thus sufficiently in the territory of Ukraine. It is not necessary to parse the territorial nexus of each and every component of the Claimants' investment; it is the investment as a whole that has that nexus.\n\n**C. Contribution to Economic Development**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nRespondent also contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants' alleged investments did not contribute significantly to the economic development of Ukraine. In Respondent's Memorial, this objection was premised on the notion that the Bareboat Charter and its associated contracts, while potentially significant for KMTI's operations, \"were not more than ordinary commercial transactions\" and did not significantly contribute to the economic development of Ukraine.138 In its Reply, Respondent challenged the significance for Ukraine's economic development of seven specific claimed investments of specific investors (such as, for example, WKG's alleged investment in 49% of IWC), apparently on the theory that each individual claimed investment must separately meet a threshold of a \"significant\" contribution.139\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 102.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 262.\n\n127.\n\nRespondent's objection relies on a premise that the Tribunal does not fully embrace. Respondent maintains that there exists an \"objective requirement\" that, to constitute a qualified investment within the jurisdictional scope of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the proposed investment must be shown to make a \"significant contribution to the host State's economic development.\"140 Absent such a showing, Respondent contends, jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention must be denied.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 76.\n\n128.\n\nRespondent does acknowledge, as it must, that the term \"investment\" is not so defined in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention\u2014indeed, \"investment\" is not defined at all in the Convention.141 The Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention specifically explains that \"[n]o attempt was made to define the term 'investment' given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre....\"142 As the tribunal in *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka* elaborated, \"the definition was left to be worked out in the subsequent practice of States, thereby preserving its integrity and flexibility and allowing for future progressive development of international law on the topic of investment.\"143\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 77.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 18 March 1965, at para. 27.\n\n*Mihaly International Corp. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2, Award, 15 March 2002, at para. 33.\n\n129.\n\nRespondent relies instead on a definition \"established in the ICSID case law\"144 that is sometimes referred to as the *\"Salini* test.\" Various tribunals have adopted some or all of the typical characteristics of an investment identified by the tribunal in *Salini v. Morocco**,*145 and have applied them as a compulsory, limiting definition of investment under the ICSID Convention.146 However, this Tribunal is not persuaded that it is appropriate to impose such a mandatory definition through case law where the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention chose not to specify one.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 76.\n\n*Salini Construittori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, at para. 52.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Joy Mining*, Award at para. 53; *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of* *Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Award, 8 May 2008, at para. 232; *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award, 1 November 2006, at paras. 29, 33.\n\n130.\n\nRather, in most cases\u2014including, in the Tribunal's view, this one\u2014it will be appropriate to defer to the State parties' articulation in the instrument of consent (*e.g.* the BIT) of what constitutes an investment. The State parties to a BIT agree to protect certain kinds of economic activity, and when they provide that disputes between investors and States relating to that activity may be resolved through, *inter alia*, ICSID arbitration, that means that they believe that that activity constitutes an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention as well. That judgment, by States that are both Parties to the BIT and Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, should be given considerable weight and deference. A tribunal would have to have compelling reasons to disregard such a mutually agreed definition of investment.\n\n131.\n\nThe *Salini* test may be useful in the event that a tribunal were concerned that a BIT or contract definition of investment was so broad that it might appear to capture a transaction that would not normally be characterized as an investment under any reasonable definition. These elements could be useful in identifying such aberrations. Indeed, of late a number of tribunals and *ad hoc* committees have expressed the view that these elements should be viewed as non-binding, non-exclusive means of identifying (rather than defining) investments that are consistent with the ICSID Convention.147\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, at paras. 312-18; *MHS v. Malaysia*, Annulment at paras. 75-79; *cf.*, *MCI Power Group, LC and New Turbine, Inc. v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award, 31 July 2007, at para. 165; *RSM Production Corp. v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/14, Award, 13 March 2009, at paras. 236-38. The first tribunals to confront directly an objection that claimant lacked an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention did not search for or apply definitions. In *Fedax*, the tribunal merely surveyed prior cases involving investments under the Convention before concluding that the promissory notes before it also qualified, *see Fedax*, Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 25-29; in *CSOB v. Slovakia*, the tribunal resisted respondent's call to apply a definition, stating that while the \"elements of the suggested definition...tend as a rule to be present in most investments, [they] are not a formal prerequisite for the finding that a transaction constitutes an investment as that concept is understood under the Convention,\" *CSOB v. Slovakia*, Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 90.\n\n132.\n\nIn any event, to the extent that showing a \"contribution to the economic development of the host state\" were required in this case, the Tribunal is satisfied that the requirement is met by the alleged investments here. The Inmaris Companies' renovation and operation of the *Khersones* through the Bareboat Charter and related contracts provided benefits directly to the Ukrainian state that it could not otherwise afford\u2014namely, a rehabilitated state asset (the *Khersones* itself)\u2014and provided valuable training for thousands of Ukrainian cadets.\n\n133.\n\nWhile Respondent disparages the importance of both for Ukraine's economic development,148 in the Tribunal's view it is relevant evidence that a state entity (KMTI) willingly participated in and directly benefited from the arrangements, and that Respondent acknowledges that \"the Contracts with Claimants could be significant for the KMTI.\"149 The Inmaris Companies' contributions were financially meaningful as well: without taking any definitive view on the Claimants' calculations, the evidence suggests that WKG alone dedicated more than DM 1,100,000 (approx. EUR 550,000) to the *Khersones* ' renovation and repair,150 even before taking into account IWC's outlays for the routine operation of the ship.\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 263-64.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 102.\n\n*See* Report of Geoffrey Senogles of LBC International, 20 March 2009, at paras. 35-48 (Ex. C-41) (discussing review of WKG audited financial statements showing DM 600,000 capital expense and DM 500,000 in non capitalized repairs).\n\n134.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's objection to jurisdiction on grounds of a lack of contribution to the economic development of Ukraine under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**D. In Accordance with Law**\n-----------------------------\n\n135.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the BIT defining the scope of its application states: \"Investments, which have been undertaken by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the legal regulations of a Contracting Party in the field of application of its legal system, shall enjoy the full protection of the Treaty.\"151 Respondent presented a variety of objections to jurisdiction based on alleged inconsistencies with Ukrainian law.\n\nArticle 9, which extends the BIT's protections to investments that pre-date the BIT's entry into force, also specifies that the extension is available to such \"investments... made in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the legislation of the latter.\" Some of the BIT's substantive protections repeat the phrasing as well. *See* Treaty, Art. 2(1) (promotion and admission of investments), Art. 3(1) (national and MFN treatment for investments).\n\n136.\n\nFirst and foremost among these was Respondent's contention that the Bareboat Charter Contract is a fictitious contract. Respondent maintained that because fictitious contracts are void as a matter of Ukrainian law, the Bareboat Charter Contract and the related Inmaris contracts derivative of it were not investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of Ukraine.152 This objection has been addressed, and rejected, in Section IV.A.1 above.\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 37-38; Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 248; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at paras. 79-85.\n\n137.\n\nA second objection was not advanced by Respondent until its Reply submission. There, Respondent argued the payment scheme under \"the Inmaris Contracts\" was not in compliance with Ukrainian laws on currency controls in effect at that time.153 More specifically, Respondent contended that the arrangement contemplated in the Four-Party Agreement (and implemented in the Bareboat Charter Contract, Donation Contract, and Trustee Contract), by which WKG's charter and donation payments were channeled to IPS as trustee and not to KMTI in Ukraine, was contrary to law. Respondent maintained that the proceeds of services exported from Ukraine (such as, Respondent contends, chartering) had to be deposited in a Ukrainian bank; that any bank accounts held outside Ukraine by a Ukrainian resident (such as, apparently in Respondent's view, the IPS trust account held on KMTI's behalf) had to be licensed by the National Bank of Ukraine; and that proceeds outside Ukraine belonging to Ukrainian residents (such as KMTI) must be declared to the National Bank of Ukraine.154\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 250-53.\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at paras. 252-53.\n\n138.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Tribunal notes that the Ukrainian foreign currency regulations identified by Respondent do not appear to impose a flat prohibition on the receipt or use of foreign currency by Ukrainian residents outside Ukraine. Rather, they provide that Ukrainian entities\u2014such as, we take it, KMTI\u2014must obtain licenses from, or declare assets located outside Ukraine to, the National Bank of Ukraine. This is clearly the case with respect to the second and third alleged illegality: the 14 July 1999 Decree on Currency Regulation System and Currency Control cited by Respondent provides that \"[a]n individual license shall be required for the operations such as:... placement of currency valuables on accounts and in deposits outside Ukraine,\" and that \"[c]urrency valuables and other property of residents, which is outside Ukraine, shall be obligatorily declared at the National Bank of Ukraine.\"155 It also appears to be the case with respect to the first alleged illegality. Respondent contended that the proceeds of services exported from Ukraine were, at the time, required to be deposited with a bank in Ukraine within 90 days. However, that requirement too appears to be subject to exceptions with an appropriate license from the Ukrainian authorities. The 4 October 1994 Law on the Procedure for Settlement in Foreign Currency cited by Respondent does provide that \"[p]roceeds of residents in foreign currency shall be credited to their currency accounts with authorised banks within the terms of debt repayment, as specified in contracts, but not later than 90 calendar days....\" But it also states that \"[e]xcess of the specified term shall require an individual license of the National Bank of Ukraine\"156\u2014a proviso that the Tribunal understands to indicate that the requirement may be waived if such a license is obtained.\n\n*See* Decree of the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine on Currency Regulation System and Currency Control, 14 July 1999 (excerpts) (Ex. R-39). Although the Decree states as a general matter that individual licenses are to be issued to \"residents and nonresidents,\" Respondent has not explained how this particular requirement relating to deposits outside Ukraine could be applicable to non-Ukrainian entities (as opposed to Ukrainian entities such as KMTI).\n\nLaw of Ukraine on the Procedure for Settlement in Foreign Currency, 4 October 1994 (excerpts), at Art. 1 (Ex. R-38).\n\n139.\n\nTo be clear, the record before the Tribunal does not indicate that any such licenses were obtained. But the Tribunal also reads these provisions of Ukrainian law as placing the burden to obtain any required license, or to make any required declaration, on the Ukrainian resident in question\u2014here, KMTI\u2014rather than on its foreign counterparty. The Tribunal concurs with Claimants' argument that it would be incongruous to declare Claimants' investments to be inconsistent with Ukrainian law based not on defaults by the foreign investors, but by a Ukrainian counterparty that was not under their control.\n\n140.\n\nThis approach is further confirmed by the fact that KMTI was not just an ordinary Ukrainian commercial counterparty, but was itself a state institution, and its participation in the Bareboat Charter Contract was also approved by other representatives of the state.157 First, it is reasonable to expect state organs and officials to be cognizant of, and comply as necessary with, the state's own legal requirements. Second, this is not a case such as *Fraport v. Philippines* (cited by Respondent), in which the facts that rendered the investment illegal under the host state's law were hidden from the state.158 Whatever Respondent might say about its lack of knowledge of the intra-Inmaris contracts, it cannot say that its representatives were unaware of the other contracts that established the payment scheme (*i.e.,* the Bareboat Charter Contract, the Trustee Contract, and the Donation Contract), because KMTI was a signatory to all of them. Third, the Tribunal takes note that during the course of the parties' negotiations prior to the commencement of this arbitration, Ukraine's representatives signed Minutes of a meeting memorializing that Mr. Soschnev, Head of the State Fisheries Committee of Ukraine, stated that \"the existing contracts, i.e. the bareboat charter contract dated 9/10/1999 (including the modifying contracts and addenda)... are valid.\"159 While the Tribunal need not go so far as to rely on this statement under the formal rubric of estoppel, we do view it as indicating that Respondent did not at that time consider those contracts (or the payment scheme contained in them) to be illegal under Ukrainian law.\n\n*See* Letter from Mr. Chernykh to Mr. Illarionov, 17 November 1999 (Exhibit C-28).\n\n*See Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, at para. 347.\n\nMinutes of the [27 January 2007] Workshop To Resolve the Problems Concerning the Ukrainian Sail Training Ship STS \"*Khersones*,\" 28 January 2007 (Ex. C-50).\n\n141.\n\nA third, and little developed, objection to the consistency of the investments with Ukrainian law relates to Addendum 2 to the Bareboat Charter Contract. Respondent initially, in its Memorial, contended that the Bareboat Charter Contract in its entirety was not made in accordance with Ukrainian law because governmental approval had not been obtained, as was claimed to be required in connection with the disposition of State property such as the *Khersones*.160 After Claimants furnished the State Committee's 17 November 1999 approval,161 Respondent in its Reply graciously withdrew this objection\u2014at least as to the October 11, 1999 Bareboat Charter and Addendum No. 1 (which were signed together).162 However, Respondent \"noted\" that Addendum No. 2 was not covered by the 17 November 1999 State Committee approval and also that it \"has signs of being backdated\" because it bears the typewritten date 11 October 1999.163 Whether this \"note\" was in fact meant as a jurisdictional objection is not clear, but the Tribunal will address it briefly here.\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at paras. 37, 39-44.\n\n*See* Letter from Mr. Chernykh to Mr. Illarionov, 17 November 1999 (Exhibit C-28).\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 254. Respondent elsewhere in its Reply contended that the Bareboat Charter Contract did not comply \"with the requirement to the form established for foreign economic contracts by the then effective law\" because two signatures were required on KMTI's side. *See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 140 (citing Law of Ukraine on Foreign Economical Activity, 16 April 1991 as amended (excerpts) at Art. 6 (Ex. R-45)). The Tribunal understands this objection to be covered by Respondent's withdrawal of its objection regarding the requisite approval for the Bareboat Charter Contract. Even if that were not the case, however, the Tribunal would be persuaded by Claimants' argument that the two-signature requirement was repealed prior to the State Committee approval ratifying the Bareboat Charter Contract, apparently rendering that requirement inapplicable to the Contract. *See* Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at para. 107.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 255.\n\n142.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal sees no signs of \"backdating\" on the face of Addendum No. 2 to the Bareboat Charter Contract. The document is titled \"Addendum 2 To the 'BareCon 89' STS ' *Khersones* '\", and the next line of typed text, before the text of the Addendum, reads \"dd. 11/10/99.\"164 In the Tribunal's view, this need not be read as a claim that Addendum No. 2 itself was signed on that date, but rather it appears to be a reference to the date on which the Contract being amended by the Addendum (*i.e.*, the \"BareCon 89\" STS \"*Khersones*\") was signed. Claimants have never suggested that Addendum No. 2 was signed on 11 October 1999; to the contrary, Claimants stated in their Counter-Memorial that Addendum No. 2 was signed in 2001.165\n\nBareboat Charter Contract STS \"*Khersones*\", 11 October 1999 (with Addenda 1 and 2) at Addendum No. 2 (Ex. R-5) (Ex. C-29).\n\n*See* Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 74 n. 44.\n\n143.\n\nRespondent's observation that Addendum No. 2 is not covered by the State Committee's 17 November 1999 approval has more merit. Chronologically, at least, the 17 November 1999 approval could not have reflected direct approval of an Addendum that was not signed until more than a year later. Ultimately, however, the validity of Addendum No. 2 does not affect this Tribunal's jurisdiction, given that the Bareboat Charter Contract itself has been determined to be a covered investment under the Treaty out of which this dispute directly arises. The validity or invalidity of Addendum No. 2 might affect questions for the merits, such as the duration of Claimants' claims to performance under the Bareboat Charter Contract, or quantum issues related to the amount payable for the charter hire. But it would not affect this Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear Claimants' claims arising out of the Bareboat Charter Contract investment, none of which appear to turn on Addendum No. 2. The Tribunal therefore leaves to the merits, to the extent (if at all) that they may be relevant there, questions such as, for example, whether or not State Committee approval was required for Addendum No. 2, whether or not such approval (if needed) was implicit or anticipated in the 17 November 1999 approval, or whether or not such approval (if needed) was afforded retroactively by the statements of Ukraine's representatives on 27 January 2007.\n\n144.\n\nA final possible objection by Respondent under the heading of \"in accordance with the legal regulations of Ukraine\" is that neither the Bareboat Charter Contract nor any of the related contracts was registered as an investment or investment contract in Ukraine.166 The Tribunal uses the term \"possible\" because it is not entirely clear whether Respondent alleged that the claimed investments violated Ukrainian law in this respect. In Respondent's Memorial, the lack of registration of the Contract as a foreign investment was noted as merely \"[a] supplementary argument that Claimants did not have a legitimate claim to performance\"; Respondent reasoned that because the contracts were not registered, \"Claimants did not consider their contract rights as 'investments' which needed legal protection.\"167 Likewise, in Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, the lack of registration was raised principally as evidence that Claimants did not consider the contracts to be investments in Ukraine. However, Respondent at the same time insisted that such registration \"is mandatory,\"168 leaving open the question whether this is in fact an \"in accordance with law\" objection to jurisdiction. In an abundance of caution, the Tribunal addresses it as such here.\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 57; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 76\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction at para. 57.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 76.\n\n145.\n\nHaving reviewed carefully Ukraine's Law on Foreign Investments Regime169 and the Regulation on the Procedure for State Registration of Agreements (Contracts) of Joint Investment Activity with Participation of a Foreign Investor170 cited by Respondent, the Tribunal understands registration of such contracts to be \"mandatory\" primarily in the sense that such registration is required if the parties to the contract wish to take advantage of legal protections for foreign investors, as well as certain tax and customs benefits that are conferred on foreign investments, under the laws of Ukraine. While the Law stipulates that contracts with foreign investors for \"joint investment activity\" should be registered,171 it also states the consequences of a failure to do so: \"[u]nregistered foreign investments shall not provide privileges and guarantees stipulated by this Law.\"172 Neither the Law nor the Regulations governing registration suggest that unregistered investments are illegal as such. It is illegality that is the touchstone of our analysis under provisions such as Article 2(2) of the BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not prepared to deem the Claimants' investments to be contrary to Ukrainian law, and thus outside the Treaty's protection, by virtue of the fact that Claimants did not afford themselves of the benefits of Ukraine's foreign investment law through registration of their contracts.\n\n*See* Law of Ukraine on Foreign Investments Regime, 16 July 1999 (Ex. R-37).\n\n*See* Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine Resolution on Approval of the Regulation of the Procedure for State Registration of Agreements (Contracts) of Joint Investment Activity with Participation of a Foreign Investor, 30 January 1997, as amended (Ex. R-40).\n\nLaw of Ukraine on Foreign Investments Regime, 16 July 1999, at Art. 24 (Ex. R-37) (\"The agreements (contracts) should be registered within the terms and according to the procedure determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.\").\n\nLaw of Ukraine on Foreign Investments Regime, 16 July 1999, at Art. 13 (Ex. R-37). The Tribunal understands this text to mean that the privileges and guarantees of the Law shall not be provided to such unregistered foreign investments. *See also* Regulation of the Procedure for State Registration of Agreements (Contracts) of Joint Investment Activity with Participation of a Foreign Investor, 30 January 1997, as amended, at Art. 4 (Ex. R-40) (\"State registration of agreements (contracts) is the ground for realization of the foreign investment under the respective agreements (contracts) pursuant to Articles 23 and 24 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Foreign Investment Regime'.\").\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n146.\n\nAlthough neither party requested costs in the first round of written submissions, Respondent in its Reply and Claimants in their Rejoinder each requested the Tribunal to award all costs of the jurisdictional proceedings.173 Both parties repeated these requests in their PostHearing Briefs.174\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction at para. 274; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction at para. 149(2). Respondent made clear that its request included \"the Respondent's costs for legal representation and assistance\"; Claimants were less specific, simply requesting that Respondent be made to bear \"all costs.\" *Id.*\n\n*See* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief at para. 103; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief at para. 41(2).\n\n147.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has decided to reserve its determination on costs until the conclusion of the proceedings, consistent with Article 61 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 28.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the parties' arguments advanced in their written submissions and at the hearing before it. For all of the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n\u2022 Respondent's objections to jurisdiction are dismissed.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal's determination with respect to costs is reserved until the conclusion of the proceedings.\n\n149.\n\nThe parties are instructed to confer and seek to reach agreement on a schedule for the merits proceedings, and to report to the Tribunal thereon within 30 days following the issuance of this Decision."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2012-03-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Request for Arbitration**\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 28 May 2008, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a request for arbitration dated 22 May 2008 (the \"Request\") filed by Claimants Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH (\"IPS\"), Windjammer Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG (\"WKG\"), Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz as the insolvency administrator of Inmaris Windjammer Chartering GmbH i.L. (\"IWC\") and Inmaris Windjammer Sailing GmbH i.L. (\"IWS\") against Ukraine (\"Respondent\") (collectively, the \"parties\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Request was made under the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Ukraine for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which was signed on 15 February 1993 and entered into force on 29 June 1996 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 29 May 2008, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted a copy to Respondent. On 16 June 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID sent the parties a Notice of Registration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to Rule 2(3) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), Claimants on 16 August 2008 elected to have the Tribunal constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Centre acknowledged Claimants\u2019 election by its letter of 18 August 2008 and invited the parties to proceed with the appointment of arbitrators.\n\n5.\n\nOn 18 August 2008, Claimants appointed Mr. Noah Rubins, a national of the United States, as a member of the Tribunal. By letter of 2 September 2008, Mr. Rubins made a disclosure with respect to two ongoing engagements on behalf of Ukraine, unrelated to the present case, as to which the parties expressly waived any objection in letters dated 4 and 5 September 2008.\n\n6.\n\nOn 27 August 2008, Respondent appointed Prof. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of Spain, as a member of the Tribunal. On the same day, Claimants proposed Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, to serve as the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal. Respondent agreed to that proposal on 10 September 2008.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal was formally constituted on 19 September 2008, in accordance with the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Ms. A'issatou Diop, Consultant, ICSID, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal. On 24 August 2011, the Secretary-General announced that Ms. Diop would take a temporary leave of absence and that Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, Consultant, ICSID, had been designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal during her absence.\n\n**C. First Session of the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nShortly before the first session of the Tribunal, Respondent by letter dated 3 December 2008 advanced its objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Respondent requested, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(3), that its objections be addressed as a preliminary matter in a separate jurisdictional phase and asked the Tribunal to set the schedule for this phase at the first session. By letter dated 8 December 2008, Claimants contended that the jurisdictional objections should be joined to the merits.\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held by telephone conference (with audio recording) on 9 December 2008. At the session, the parties expressly confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no objection to any of its members serving as an arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nAfter hearing both parties on, *inter alia,* the procedure to be adopted with respect to Respondent\u2019s objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections should be addressed in a separate, preliminary phase of the proceedings and set a schedule for the jurisdictional phase.\n\n11.\n\nThe agreement of the parties, and the decisions of the Tribunal on matters as to which the parties were not agreed, were recorded in the Minutes of the First Session signed by the President and Secretary of the Tribunal, dated 17 December 2008.\n\n**D. Submissions and Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe parties filed their submissions on jurisdiction between 27 January 2009 and 6 July 2009, in accordance with the schedule established during the first session of the Tribunal and extensions granted by the Tribunal thereafter.\n\n13.\n\nThe hearing on Respondent\u2019s obj ections to jurisdiction was held in The Hague at the Permanent Court of Arbitration on 20 and 21 July 2009.\n\n14.\n\nThe parties were represented in The Hague as follows:\n\nClaimants :\n\nDr. Ulrich Theune, Dr. Richard Happ, Mr. Georg-Maximilian von Arnim, and Ms. Yun-I Kim of *Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH*\n\nRespondent :\n\nDr. Sergei Voitovich, Mr. Dmitri Grischenko, Mr. Dmitri Shemelin, and Mr. Sava\n\nPoliakov of *Grischenko & Partners*\n\n15.\n\nMs. Jojanneke Deelstra of Omni Bridgeway was also present at the hearing as part of Claimants\u2019 delegation.\n\n16.\n\nThe parties submitted Post-Hearing Briefs simultaneously on 1 September 2009.\n\n**E. Decision on Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 March 2010, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal dismissed Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and reserved its determination on costs until the conclusion of the proceedings. The Decision on Jurisdiction is incorporated herein by reference, except where specifically indicated below.\n\n**F. Submissions on the Merits**\n--------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn the basis of the agreement of the parties, on 2 June 2010, the Tribunal set the following schedule for the merits phase:\n\n\u2022 Claimants to file their Memorial on the Merits by 1 September 2010;\n\n\u2022 Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial on the Merits by 1 December 2010;\n\n\u2022 Claimants to file their Reply on the Merits by 27 January 2011;\n\n\u2022 Respondent to file its Rejoinder on the Merits by 24 March 2011; and\n\n\u2022 A Hearing on the Merits to be held in The Hague between 16 and 20 May 2011. By letter dated 3 August 2010, Claimants requested an extension to file their Memorial on the Merits and proposed revisions to the schedule for the written submissions. On 5 August 2010, the Tribunal invited the parties to agree on a revised schedule in light of Claimants\u2019 request. Respondent subsequently informed the Tribunal by letter dated 10 August 2011 that the parties had failed to reach an agreement on a revised schedule and asked the Tribunal to rule on the matter. On 11 August 2011, the Tribunal informed the parties that it had revised the schedule for written submissions, but the dates of 16- 20 May 2011 reserved for the hearing would remain unchanged.\n\n19.\n\nClaimants filed their Memorial on 8 September 2010 in accordance with the revised schedule. Due to time constraints, the expert reports in support of Claimants\u2019 Memorial (an expert legal opinion by [... ] of the law firm [... ] and an expert damages report by [... ] did not accompany the submission but were sent directly to the Centre on the same date.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, in which Respondent raised a counterclaim for the first time. By letter dated 5 January 2011, Claimants requested that the Tribunal allow them two weeks following the Respondent\u2019s submission of its Rejoinder on the Merits to submit comments specifically on the counterclaim. On 6 January 2011, Respondent objected to Claimants\u2019 request as being contrary to the schedule set by the Tribunal and prejudicial to Respondent\u2019s procedural right to have sufficient preparation time for the hearing. On 7 January 2011, the Tribunal decided that, in accordance with procedural fairness and the principle of equality of the parties, Claimants would be granted ten calendar days after the due date of Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder to provide further comments on the counterclaim in addition to any response made in Claimants\u2019 Reply.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 26 January 2011, Claimants informed the Tribunal and Respondent of an error in the submission of the expert damages report by [...].  \n The electronic and hard copy versions of the report contained differences with respect to the modeling of income and expenses. Claimants noted that Respondent\u2019s damages expert, [...], appeared to have relied on the erroneous electronic version in arguing that there were discrepancies between Claimants\u2019 Memorial and the accompanying damages report. Respondent stated on 27 January 2011 that, in view of Claimants\u2019 error, it reserved its right to respond separately to the hard copy report in its Rejoinder on the Merits. Claimants submitted the corrected electronic report on the same date.\n\n22.\n\nOn 10 February 2011, Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits. By letter of 11 February 2011, Respondent identified two documents, the electronic copies of which had not been submitted with Claimants\u2019 Reply. Claimants submitted the missing documents electronically on the same date.\n\n23.\n\nRespondent filed its Rej oinder on the Merits on 7 April 2011. Pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 7 January 2011, Claimants filed their Rejoinder to the Counterclaim after ten calendar days, on 17 April 2011.\n\n**G. Procedural Orders Regarding Production of Documents**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal issued three procedural orders during the written phase of the proceedings, all in relation to Respondent\u2019s document production request of 5 November 2010.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 29 November 2010. For a number of Respondent\u2019s requests, which Claimants opposed as being overly burdensome, the Tribunal accepted Claimants\u2019 offer to allow Respondent\u2019s damages experts to review the documents, and invited the parties to reach an agreement on the modalities of the inspection and inform the Tribunal. These requests related to documents concerning the insolvency claims of IWC and IWS; tourist cruises booked in 2006; the frustrated investments claimed by Claimants; and documents reviewed by Claimants\u2019 damages expert, [...], and listed in Appendix A of his report of 31 August 2010. Similar instructions to reach an agreement on an inspection of the documents by Respondent\u2019s experts were issued with respect to the request for correspondence dated between 5 April 2006 and the end of the 2006 sailing season, to the extent that the documents were in the possession of Claimants or their legal representative and the request did not overlap with other documents already produced or requested. Following agreement by the parties, Respondent\u2019s experts visited the offices of Claimants\u2019 counsel in Hamburg to inspect these documents during the preparation of their second expert damages report.\n\n26.\n\nFor requests by Respondent involving categories of documents over which Claimants had asserted legal privilege, the Tribunal invited Claimants to specify the nature of the privileges asserted with respect to each type of document requested, to confirm that the documents were in the possession of Claimants or their legal representative, and to state whether German law would allow the documents to be disclosed to the Tribunal and Respondent pursuant to a confidentiality undertaking.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal issued an order with respect to the remainder of Respondent\u2019s document requests, granting some and rejecting others. Where Claimants had already produced documents responsive to the request, the Tribunal either ordered Claimants to produce other responsive documents, if they existed, or denied the request.\n\n28.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 to address, *inter alia,* further requests for documents over which Claimants had asserted legal privilege. The Tribunal instructed Claimants to make further document production responsive to these requests only to the Tribunal. For one request, Claimants were to provide all documents relating to a narrower category of documents than that requested by Respondent; for other requests, Claimants were to provide a log of all responsive documents, which would enable the Tribunal to determine whether it would be appropriate to order that these documents be produced.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on 21 January 2011, directing Claimants to produce all documents, correspondence, and communications exchanged between Claimants and [... ], a third-party funder that had decided not to fund Claimants in this arbitration, because, to the extent that any privilege had applied to such documents, it had been waived by Claimants\u2019 submission of an affidavit by [...], in-house counsel with [...].\n\n**H. Pre-Hearing Decisions and Conference**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nBy letters dated 12 and 14 April 2011, the parties exchanged lists of witnesses whom they intended to call for cross-examination. On 15 April 2011, Claimants disputed Respondent\u2019s selection of four witnesses - [...], [...], [...], and [...] - on the ground that they had submitted witness statements only during the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings, and had not supplemented their statements during the merits phase. On 19 April 2011, the Tribunal decided that Respondent was entitled to call the four witnesses for cross-examination at the hearing, since their testimony related in part to merits issues.\n\n31.\n\nA pre-hearing conference with the President of the Tribunal and the parties was held on 26 April 2011 by telephone (with audio recording). The parties agreed on a number of procedural matters for the upcoming hearing, and the Tribunal resolved the remaining issues on which the parties had not agreed.\n\n32.\n\nThe parties\u2019 agreements and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were recorded in the Minutes of the Pre-Hearing Conference, which were circulated to the parties on 5 May 2011.\n\n**I. Hearing on the Merits**\n----------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Hearing on the Merits was held in The Hague at the Permanent Court of Arbitration between 16 and 20 May 2011.\n\n34.\n\nThe parties were represented as follows:\n\nClaimants :\n\nDr. Richard Happ, Dr. Ulrich Theune, Dr. Carl Phillip Herdt, and Dr. Jan Asmus Bischoff of *Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH*\n\nRespondent :\n\nDr. Sergei Voitovich, Mr. Dmitri Grischenko, Mr. Dmitri Shemelin, and Mr. Sava Poliakov of *Grischenko & Partners*\n\n35.\n\nThe following witnesses were examined in person before the Tribunal:\n\n[...]\n\n36.\n\nA number of witnesses were also examined via video link from the World Bank offices in Kyiv, Ukraine, in the presence of counsel for both parties:\n\n[...]\n\n37.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the Parties confirmed that they were satisfied with the conduct of the proceedings.1\n\n*See* Tr. 1135:23 - 1136:14.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal proposed that the parties provide corrections to the transcript by 3 June 2011, and the parties informed the President of the Tribunal that they had agreed to make their submissions on costs by 31 August 2011.\n\n39.\n\nThe parties submitted Post-Hearing Briefs simultaneously on 30 June 2011.\n\n**J. Submissions on Costs and Fees**\n------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nOn 31 August 2011, the parties provided their respective Statements of Costs.\n\n41.\n\nClaimants sought reimbursement of EUR 910,333.47 in costs of legal representation and EUR 1,131,496.53 in other costs (including honoraria paid to experts), as well as reimbursement of their advance payment to ICSID of USD 425,000 for the costs of arbitration and any further advance payments that might need to be made, to the extent that these payments are not refunded.\n\n42.\n\nRespondent claimed USD 669,144.71 in costs of legal representation and USD 642,727.75 in other costs (including honoraria paid to experts).\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal shall address the claims for costs after examining the facts and merits of the dispute.\n\n**II. FACTS OF THE DISPUTE**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Overview**\n---------------\n\n[...]\n\n**B. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n49.\n\nAs noted, Respondent in this dispute is Ukraine. [X], which played a very prominent role in the events giving rise to this dispute, is a Ukrainian state education institute.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal shall refer to Claimants collectively as the \"Inmaris Companies.\" The Inmaris Companies include the following:\n\n*Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH* (\"IPS\"), a German limited liability company owned by individual shareholders, including [..,].3\n\n*Windjammer Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG* (\"WKG\"), a German limited partnership (Kommanditgesellchaft) represented by a single general partner (\"GP\"), and with 29 individuals as limited partners (\"LPs\")4 Claimants explain that IPS was the general partner of WKG until 2001, and later resumed that role in 2008. In the interim period between 2001 and 2008, IWS (see below) was the general partner of WKG.5\n\n*Inmaris Windjammer Chartering GmbH i.L* (\"IWC\"), a German limited liability company which, as of February 2009, had two shareholders: WKG (49 percent) and IWS (51 percent).6 IWC was put under insolvency administration and went into liquidation proceedings on 30 November 2006; Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz, the Insolvency Administrator, appeared on behalf of IWC as Claimant in this proceeding.7\n\n*Inmaris Windjammer Sailing GmbH i.L* (\"IWS\"), a German limited liability company owned by individual shareholders, including [...].8 IWS was also put under insolvency administration and went into liquidation proceedings on 30 November 2006; Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz, the Insolvency Administrator, appears on behalf of IWS as Claimant in this proceeding.9\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Exhibit C-7).\n\n*See* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the L\u00fcbeck Local Court, 11 February 2009 (Exhibit C-8).\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 23 March 2001 (\"Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction\") at para. 21; Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the L\u00fcbeck Local Court, 11 February 2009 (Exhibit C-8) (identifying IPS as current general partner of WKG, noting that the last update to registration was 8 May 2008); Letter from WKG to [X], 22 December 2001 (Exhibit C-9) (notifying change of \"Complementary shareholder\" of WKG from IPS to IWS).\n\n*See* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 19 February 2009 (Exhibit C-10). Inasmuch as IWS was not formed until August 2001, *see* Excerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Exhibit C-l 1), the 51 percent share held by IWS as of February 2009 was necessarily held by another entity prior to August 2001. However, the Excerpt from the Commercial Register for IWC appears to indicate that IWS held that stake in IWC as of October 2002 *(i.e.* well in advance of April 2006).\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 19 February 2009 (Exhibit C-10). For convenience, the Tribunal in this Decision will refer to IWC, even though Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz is formally the Claimant on IWC\u2019s behalf.\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Exhibit C-l 1).\n\nExcerpt of the Commercial Register of the Hamburg Local Court, 12 February 2009 (Exhibit C-l 1). For convenience, the Tribunal in this Decision will refer to IWS, even though Dr. Sven-Holger Undritz is formally the Claimant on IWS\u2019s behalf.\n\n51.\n\nThe corporate relationships of the Inmaris Companies as of April 2006, when the dispute came to a head, are illustrated in the diagram below:\n\n**C. The Contracts**\n--------------------\n\n52.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will examine the contractual relationships between [X] and the Inmaris companies, starting with the 1991 General Contract, then the 1996 Basic Contract, and, finally, the 1999 Bareboat Charter and related contracts. The Tribunal will then examine the contractual arrangements among the various Inmaris Companies.\n\n**1. The 1991 General Contract**\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**2.

Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n--------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**III. MERITS**\n---------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims. Claimants allege that Ukraine\u2019s actions denied Claimants fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the BIT, amounted to arbitrary and capricious behavior in violation of Article 2(3) of the BIT, expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment without payment of compensation in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT, and amounted to an impermissible intervention in the Khersones project in violation of paragraph 4 of the Additional Protocol to the BIT.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal will first begin with an examination of Respondent\u2019s argument that the relevant acts giving rise to this dispute were not attributable to Ukraine. The Tribunal will then examine each of Claimants\u2019 claims in turn.\n\n**A. Attribution**\n------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n--------------------------\n\n234.\n\nClaimants complain of a series of acts that they believe are attributable to Respondent. As discussed in further detail below in the discussion of Claimants\u2019 individual claims, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the critical event that gave rise to this dispute is the instruction by the Ministry not to let the ship leave the territorial waters of Ukraine. The acts preceding the event do not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, rise to the level of a breach of the BIT. Moreover, [X] appears to have been consistently in support of the continuation of the project and took substantial measures prior to April 2006 to facilitate an amicable resolution to the dispute that began to arise in 2005.222 For these reasons, whether the acts of [X] are attributable to Ukraine is not the relevant question, and the Tribunal need not address that point.\n\n*See, e.g,* [...] Witness Statement at para. 25.\n\n235.\n\nThe critical issue is whether the April 2006 instruction preventing the ship from leaving the territorial waters of Ukraine (an instruction that undisputedly came from the Ministry of Agricultural Policy and not [X]), and the sustained refusal to allow the ship to leave Ukraine over the course of the following year, is attributable to the State.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that such instruction was clearly an act of the State. The instruction was given by the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, which is an organ of the State. The Ministry then conveyed similar instructions to the port authorities and border guards - also state or quasi-state entities.223 Based on the facts on the record, it is reasonable to conclude that these instructions were the sole reason why the ship did not leave port. There can be no doubt that such instructions were issued by the State. There has been some suggestion that the ship\u2019s captain, [...], might have been more persistent in moving the Khersones out of Kerch on the day in question, because it was not entirely clear that sailing had actually been prohibited by the authorities. But it is clear from the relevant documentation and testimony that the Khersones almost certainly would have been kept in port whatever efforts [... ] had undertaken. Moreover, it is understandable that he (and his employers at Inmaris) would have been cautious in those circumstances.224\n\nLetter from [...] to [X], 14 April 2006 (Exhibit C-94).\n\n*See, e.g.,* Tr. 574 - 575. In response to a question from the Tribunal asking why he did \"not order [his] agent to get the necessary permissions, despite the telegram,\" [...] responded, \"But it is impossible. If the Minister forbade the port authorities to give use clearance to leave the port, nobody is going to follow any of my orders, instructions. To give an order to the agent to get any permissions, it is impossible to do that in our country when the Minister has forbidden it.\".\n\n237.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal finds that the travel ban was attributable to the State. This does not, of course, answer the question of whether that act was in breach of the BIT. The Tribunal now turns to that issue.\n\n**B. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the BIT states: \"Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote as far as possible investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its respective laws. It shall in any case accord investments fair and equitable treatment.\" Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s behavior immediately prior to, during, and after the alleged arrest of the ship amounted to a denial of fair and equitable treatment. Respondent denies the claim.\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n--------------------------\n\n**a. Scope of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nAs noted, the parties disagree as to the basic content of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Respondent contends that the standard requires nothing more than treatment in accordance with the international minimum standard of treatment required by customary international law. In support of its position, Respondent cites several decisions under the investment chapter of the NAFTA as well as a few additional cases that have equated \"fair and equitable treatment\" with the customary international law standard. In contrast, Claimants assert that the fair and equitable treatment standard is an autonomous standard that is not limited to customary international law. As a practical matter, the main difference between the two views articulated by Respondent and Claimants is that, under Respondent\u2019s proposed standard, only gross unfairness or actions that shock one\u2019s sense of legal propriety would run afoul of Article 2(1), while, under Claimants\u2019 proposed standard, government conduct need only be unfair and not necessarily \"gross\" or \"shocking.\"\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that several NAFTA decisions have concluded that \"fair and equitable treatment\" requires nothing more than the treatment required by customary international law. However, the three parties to the NAFTA - the United States, Canada, and Mexico - issued a binding interpretation of the relevant provision in NAFTA that requires that it be interpreted in that fashion. There is no such agreement between Ukraine and Germany with respect to the interpretation of Article 2(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal also recognizes that a few non-NAFTA cases have concluded that fair and equitable treatment is limited to customary international law, but the Tribunal must respectfully disagree with those decisions.\n\n265.\n\nThere is nothing in the BIT that limits Article 2(1) to the standard required by customary international law. In the absence of such a statement, the Tribunal interprets the language as written, i.e., the government is obligated to accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investments, and therefore there is no need to establish that the government\u2019s actions were in breach of customary international law in order to establish a breach of Article 2(1). Any government act that is unfair or inequitable with respect to a covered investment breaches that obligation. A government act could be unfair or inequitable if it is in breach of specific commitments, if it is undertaken for political reasons or other improper motives, if the investor is not treated in an objective, even-handed, unbiased, and transparent way, or for other reasons.\n\n266.\n\nRespondent also asserts that the fair and equitable treatment standard is limited to *investments* and does not apply to investors. While the language of Article 2(1) nominally applies to investments, the distinction Respondent seeks to draw has no practical import. If Respondent denied fair and equitable treatment to Claimants\u2019 investment (i.e., their participation in the contractual arrangements), then it also denied fair and equitable treatment to Claimants themselves insofar as they are owners of the investment. The primary act of which Claimants complain - the travel ban - could be cast as a denial of fair and equitable treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment, i.e., the entire operation of the project and the exercise of Claimants\u2019 contractual rights, or of Claimants themselves, i.e., they were prejudiced to the extent that their investment was unfairly undermined. There is no practical difference.\n\n**b. Tribunal\u2019s Findings with Respect to the Alleged Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the specific claims Claimants have raised. The Tribunal will deal first with claims arising out of events prior to the travel ban. The Tribunal will then address the travel ban specifically.\n\n268.\n\nApart from the travel ban, Claimants point to several other actions of [X], the Ministry, and other government officials or bodies as evidence that Respondent breached Ukraine\u2019s fair and equitable treatment obligation. The Tribunal shall not repeat the explanation of each of these actions events, but, in summary, Claimants believe that Respondent failed to act openly and transparently in its interactions with Claimants, arbitrarily questioned the legality of the Bareboat Charter and other contractual arrangements, made unreasonable and baseless demands with respect to the production of information, and engaged in other behavior that, Claimants assert, was inconsistent with the contracts and the parties\u2019 course of dealing. For the reasons explained below, the Tribunal concludes that by these actions Respondent did not breach its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment.\n\n269.\n\nA party to a contract has a right at any time to request information from the other party and to review (and even revise) its views regarding the advisability and legality of a particular contractual arrangement. This does not mean that the party can take matters into its own hands and seek to unilaterally abrogate an agreement, amend its terms, or coerce the other party into taking actions it otherwise would not. However, apart from the travel ban, the actions of Respondent do not reach this level.\n\n270.\n\nAs is apparent from the factual discussion above, the contractual arrangements between Claimants and [X] were far from clear. They contained many apparent internal inconsistencies, that require significant interpretive effort to decipher. The Acts, which are the primary evidence of the parties\u2019 behavior leading up to the Bareboat Charter, were ambiguous at best, and, during the course of the arbitration, the parties could not even provide a clear position as to which party was responsible for generating the Acts or the methodology used to create them. Furthermore, the contracts had clear and glaring omissions, including failing to provide any explicit rules on the division of revenues or allocation of profits under the Basic Contract, and failing to indicate clearly which party was responsible for the winter costs under the Bareboat Charter. In light of these difficulties, the Tribunal can find no fault in Respondent questioning the structure and nature of the contractual arrangements.\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with Respondent\u2019s view that the contractual arrangements with Claimants did not *guarantee* that Claimants would earn a reasonable return on the operation of the vessel. Certainly, no specific rate of return was guaranteed, as evidenced by the fluctuating financial performance of the ship over the term of the contracts. To the extent there were such expectations of future revenues and profits, they must have been rooted in the historical performance of the ship and the expectations of the future development of the market.\n\n272.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal does not find that, prior to the travel ban, Respondent acted in bad faith or otherwise denied Claimants due process. There were many discussions between Claimants and Respondent regarding the contracts, and Claimants had ample opportunity to present their side of the issue. The fact that Respondent disagreed with Claimants and, in Claimants\u2019 view, did not take proper consideration of Claimants\u2019 arguments does not prove a breach of the BIT. Even the fact that Respondent\u2019s views may have changed regarding the legality of the contracts does not prove that Respondent acted improperly. Views change with time, and such evolution is not surprising given the length of the contractual arrangement and the infirmities in the drafting of the contracts as noted above.\n\n273.\n\nHowever, the travel ban was of an entirely different nature than the other acts of which Claimants complain. While it is perfectly appropriate for a party to question a contractual arrangement and seek to modify its terms, it must do so within the confines of the law and through proper channels. It is not permissible for a party simply to take matters into its own hands and unilaterally prevent performance of a contract, particularly through the exercise of government authority, which is precisely what occurred in this case. By instructing [X], as well as the port and border authorities, not to let the ship leave port, Respondent stepped over the line. It was no longer seeking to renegotiate the agreement but was instead unilaterally and forcefully abrogating the arrangement or attempting to coerce a renegotiation. It did not seek reformation through proper legal channels by, *e.g.,* instructing [X] to bring a breach of contract claim in local courts. Instead, it used its governmental authority to prevent the ship from sailing, and then followed up the instruction to [X] with similar instructions to the port and border authorities.\n\n274.\n\nAs noted, Respondent argued at length that the telegram and ensuing travel ban did not result in a legal \"arrest\" of the ship. The fact remains, however, that for all practical purposes the ship could not sail, and such ban was imposed upon the instruction of the government. Regardless of whether the action constituted a formal \"arrest,\" the practical effect was the same.\n\n275.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the instruction from the Ministry preventing the ship from leaving the territorial waters of Ukraine, and the ban that remained in effect for the ensuing year, amounted to a denial of fair and equitable treatment in violation of Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n**C. Arbitrary Action**\n-----------------------\n\n276.\n\nArticle 2(3) of the BIT states, \"No Contracting Party should in any way impede the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment of investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party by means of arbitrary or discriminatory measures.\" Claimants argue that Respondent\u2019s actions were arbitrary and capricious and, therefore, in violation of Article 2(3). Respondent denies the assertion. The Tribunal examines the parties\u2019 arguments below.\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n--------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Ministry\u2019s instruction preventing the ship from leaving the territorial waters of Ukraine was an arbitrary measure that impeded the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment of Claimants\u2019 investment and, therefore, was a breach of Article 2(3) of the BIT. As noted above, the instruction imposing the travel ban had no basis in the contract, and Respondent failed to follow any proper legal channels in seeking reformation of the contract, if indeed that was Respondent\u2019s primary concern, or in challenging the legality of the contract or Claimants\u2019 performance. Instead, Respondent\u2019s actions constituted a unilateral exercise of sovereign authority in ordering [X] to prevent the ship from traveling in April 2006 and for a year thereafter, including through direct communications to the port authorities and border guards. These actions prevented the operation of the project envisioned in the contracts and, thereby, deprived Claimants of the use of their investment.\n\n283.\n\nHowever, for the same reasons discussed above in the context of Claimants\u2019 fair and equitable treatment claims, the Tribunal does not believe that Respondent\u2019s other actions of which Claimants complain (apart from the travel ban), including its dealings with Claimants prior to the imposition of the travel ban, were arbitrary. There is nothing arbitrary about a party to a contract raising questions regarding the propriety or advisability of the agreement and seeking improved terms, provided that such actions do not amount to coercion. The Ministry\u2019s actions prior to the issuance of the telegram were the actions of a partner operating in an environment where the parties\u2019 rights and obligations as set forth in the underlying legal instruments were ambiguous and the contractual terms were deficient in several crucial respects.\n\n**D. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n284.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the BIT states that \"[i]nvestments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to any other measure the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for the public benefit and against compensation.\" Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s actions expropriated their contractual rights. Respondent denies the claims.\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n--------------------------\n\n300.\n\nAs described above, the Tribunal finds that the telegram instructing [X] not to let the ship leave the territorial waters of Ukraine, and the continuation of the travel ban for the ensuing year, was a sovereign act taken by Respondent. That act deprived Claimants of access to and control over the essential asset for its investment, i.e., the ship, and thus of Claimants\u2019 contractual rights to use that asset. While Respondent asserts that any deprivation was merely temporary because the travel ban was lifted after one year, the damage to the investment had by that time been done. An entire sailing season was cancelled, and Claimants\u2019 business suffered substantial harm such that they could not reasonably have been expected to resume operations as if nothing had happened. Indeed, at that stage, two of the Claimants were in insolvency proceedings, and, even if those entities had remained solvent, it is not reasonable to assume that customers would be willing to work with them in light of these events.\n\n301.\n\nWhether the actions of Respondent amounted to a direct expropriation or a measure tantamount to expropriation is not critical to the Tribunal\u2019s finding. Certainly, the withholding of a key asset could be viewed as an effective seizure of Claimant\u2019s right to use that asset. Title to the ship was, however, never vested in Claimants. At a minimum, the travel ban amounted to an indirect expropriation in that it destroyed the value of Claimants\u2019 contractual rights and such diminution in value (due to the lasting damage to Claimants\u2019 business) was, for all intents and purposes, permanent. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent\u2019s actions amounted to expropriation or a measure tantamount to expropriation, which was not accompanied by any compensation, in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT.\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s argument that it was necessary for Claimants to bring their dispute to local courts before making an expropriation claim in this arbitration. In the very case Respondent cites to support its position *(Generation Ukraine),* the tribunal found that \"[t]here is, of course, no formal obligation upon the Claimant to exhaust local remedies before resorting to ICSID arbitration pursuant to the BIT.\"332 This is precisely the point - nowhere does the treaty suggest that exhaustion of local remedies is a pre-requisite (either procedurally or substantively).\n\n*Generation Ukraine,* Award at para. 20.33.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejects Claimants\u2019 assertion that the travel ban was not taken for a public purpose. There is no evidence that Ukraine\u2019s actions were politically motivated, or due to corruption, a desire for personal gain, or a personal vendetta. In fact, there is no evidence that it was motivated by anything other than protecting the government\u2019s interests. The Ministry believed that the government was entitled to a share of the profits, and it was seeking to protect the public fisc. In addition, the Ministry appeared to believe that the travel ban was necessary to prevent the ship from being arrested abroad. Whether that belief was well founded is not relevant to the question of whether Ukraine\u2019s actions were for a public purpose. The Tribunal is convinced that the Ministry\u2019s actions were genuinely motivated by an intent to protect the public interest. As the Tribunal has explained, the remedy the Ministry chose was inappropriate, but that does not mean that its motivation was illegitimate. In other words, while the Ministry may have believed it was acting in the public interest, its actions in pursuit of that interest were nevertheless disproportionate and arbitrary.\n\n304.\n\nAt the same time, however, the Tribunal notes that improper motive or intent is not a prerequisite to a finding of expropriation. As the tribunal concluded in *Vivendi II**:*\n\nWhile intent will weigh in favour of showing a measure to be expropriatory, it is not a requirement, because the *effect* of the measure on the investor, not the state\u2019s intent, is the critical factor. As Professor Christie explained in his famous article in the British Yearbook of International Law more than 40 years ago, a state may expropriate property where it interferes with it even though the state expressly disclaims such intention. Indeed, international tribunals, jurists and scholars have consistently appreciated that states may accomplish expropriations in ways other than by formal decree; often in ways that may seek to cloak expropriative conduct with a veneer of legitimacy.333\n\n*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, at para. 7.5.20, citations omitted.\n\n305.\n\nIn other words, once a measure has been found to be expropriatory, a State must pay compensation, even if the measure is taken for a public purpose. Whether a government act is taken for a public purpose does not change the fact that compensation is owed.\n\n**E. Paragraph 4 of the Additional Protocol of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nParagraph 4 of the Additional Protocol to the BIT states, \"[w]ith regard to Article 4... [a] claim for compensation shall also exist in case of an intervention in the enterprise, which is an object of the investment, through state measures and its economic substance is impaired substantially thereby.\" Article 4 of the BIT includes, among other things, the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment and protection against uncompensated expropriation.\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n--------------------------\n\n309.\n\nParagraph 4 of the Additional Protocol to the BIT is prefaced with the overarching statement that it is \"[w]ith regard to Article 4\" of the BIT. Consequently, the Tribunal does not believe that paragraph 4 creates an additional, free-standing obligation, but rather, that it merely interprets the basic obligations already present in Article 4 of the BIT. In light of the Tribunal\u2019s findings that Respondent\u2019s actions breached Article 4, a separate discussion of paragraph 4 of the Additional Protocol would add nothing to, and certainly would not change, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions with respect to Respondent\u2019s compliance with Article 4. There is, therefore, no need to resolve the parties\u2019 differences in the translation and interpretation of paragraph 4 of the Additional Protocol.\n\n**IV. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n310.\n\nClaimants assert that they are entitled to compensation for damages to the Inmaris Companies resulting from Respondent\u2019s actions, including, most significantly, the telegram instructing [X] not to let the ship leave the territorial waters of Ukraine. Respondent denies that its actions were the cause of any damage to Claimants and, in any event, contests the amount of damages claimed.\n\n311.\n\nWe address below each of Claimants\u2019 heads of claim and Respondent\u2019s arguments with respect to such claims. The Tribunal\u2019s findings follow thereafter.\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**1. Damages Incurred as a Result of the Travel Ban**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**a. Insolvency Claims**\n------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**b.

Causation**\n----------------\n\n381.\n\nAs stated in Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\" Respondent has presented arguments that its acts did not cause the harm in question under a standard that considers either whether the acts were a \"proximate\" cause of the harm or whether the harm was a \"foreseeable\" result of the acts. The Tribunal finds that the action taken by Respondent in ordering that the ship not leave the territorial waters of Ukraine caused the harm to Claimants under either standard discussed by Respondent. As a direct result of that instruction, Claimants had to cancel the 2006 sailing season. It is irrelevant that there was some uncertainty about the duration of the travel ban in the first few days after the ban was issued, or that Claimants continued to try to do business for some time in the hope that the ban would be lifted. The ban was wrongful and should never have been imposed. As it remained in place beyond the start of the 2006 season, Claimants did what was necessary to cancel the bookings. The ban remained in force for a year, and, at that point, the damage to Claimants became irreversible.\n\n382.\n\nIn addition, the cancellation of the sailing season, which was a direct result of the telegram, led to Claimants\u2019 insolvency and the other damages discussed in further detail below. While Respondent has argued that its actions did not cause Claimants\u2019 insolvency, or that Claimants initiated insolvency proceedings prematurely, it is clear to the Tribunal that Claimants had little choice in taking the action they did. The indefinite postponement or cancellation of the sailing season had immediate effects on Claimants\u2019 business, and they had to take urgent steps to address their outstanding debt obligations.\n\n**2. Damages Claims**\n---------------------\n\n**a. Insolvency Claims**\n------------------------\n\n383.\n\nAs noted, Claimants claim damages of EUR [...] for insolvency claims associated with IWC, and EUR [... ] for insolvency claims associated with IWS, both of which include a combination of claims approved by the insolvency administrator, disputed claims, and claims that have not yet been verified.\n\n**(i) IWC Insolvency Claims**\n-----------------------------\n\n384.\n\nAccording to [...], the claims against IWC can be divided into the following three categories:474\n\n\u2022 Approved and included: EUR [... ]\n\n\u2022 Disputed: EUR [...]\n\n\u2022 Filed but not yet verified: EUR [... ]\n\n[...] Witness Statement at para. 3.1 (Exhibit C-WS-19).\n\n385.\n\nThese claims total EUR [...]. As noted, this total includes certain erroneous claims, which Claimants do not include in their damages claim. The Tribunal understands that these erroneous claims are included in the \"disputed\" category above. The Tribunal also notes that there appear to be at least two other claims (IWC Claims 21 and 23), which Claimants did not deduct from their damages claim, but which also appear to be erroneous. The Tribunal notes that [...] himself has also filed a disputed claim in the insolvency proceedings for over EUR [...].\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no basis for awarding damages for claims that are either disputed or unverified. The Tribunal understands Claimants\u2019 argument that these claims may eventually be proven and accepted by the insolvency administrator. However, the Tribunal cannot base its decision on the uncertain possibility that this will come to pass.\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, however, that Claimants are entitled to damages for the approved insolvency claims in the amount of **EUR [...],** As these amounts have not yet been paid, the Tribunal does not award any interest for these amounts.\n\n**(ii) IWS Insolvency Claims**\n------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nAccording to Dr. Undritz, the claims against IWC can be divided into the following three categories:475\n\n\u2022 Approved and included: EUR [... ]\n\n\u2022 Disputed: EUR [...]\n\n\u2022 Filed but not yet verified: EUR [... ]\n\nUndritz Witness Statement at para. 3.2 (Exhibit C-WS-19).\n\n389.\n\nThese claims total EUR [...]. As noted, this total includes certain erroneous claims, which Claimants do not include in their damages claim. Claimants reduced this figure in their damages claim to account for certain erroneous claims.\n\n390.\n\nDr. Undritz provided two charts with details on the insolvency claims against IWS. The first chart, provided with his original Witness Statement, provides details on the various creditors and the amounts and reasons for the claims, but no indication as to whether the claims are disputed. The second chart, provided with his Additional Witness Statement, however, contains dozens of entries in which *no* information is provided on the creditor or amount of the claim filed but which nevertheless indicate that the claim has been accepted. Consequently, the presentation of these various claims has been made unnecessarily complicated and difficult to follow.\n\n391.\n\nIn any event, for the same reasons noted above with respect to IWC, the Tribunal sees no basis for awarding damages for claims that are either disputed or not verified. The Tribunal finds, however, that Claimants are entitled to damages for the approved insolvency claims in the amount of **EUR [...],** Again, as these amounts have not yet been paid, the Tribunal does not award any interest for these amounts.\n\n**3. Insolvency Costs**\n-----------------------\n\n392.\n\nAs noted, Claimants claim damages for insolvency costs in the amount of EUR [...]. Respondent argues that such costs are speculative. The Tribunal has concluded that Respondent\u2019s act caused Claimants\u2019 insolvency, and, therefore, Respondent is responsible for compensating Claimants for the resulting harm, including with respect to the payment of insolvency costs.\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the costs are speculative given that they have not yet been finally established, but at the same time, it must be recognized that Claimants *will* be required to bear substantial costs, which they would not have borne in the absence of Respondent\u2019s wrongful conduct. According to the letter from the Clerk of the insolvency court, \"The total costs of the proceedings (court fees, fees for the preliminary insolvency administrator and the insolvency administrator) will, from today\u2019s perspective, amount to net nearly Euro [...] and Euro [...].\" On this basis, the Tribunal awards Claimants **EUR [...]** to cover the costs of the insolvency proceeding. It does not appear that such amounts have yet been paid (although it is inevitable that they will be). Therefore, it would be inappropriate to award any interest associated with this head of claim.\n\n**4. Customs Fine**\n-------------------\n\n394.\n\nClaimants provide no documentation for their claim for reimbursement for the alleged customs liability of EUR [...]. Their sole evidence consists of a statement made in the affidavit of Claimants\u2019 witness, [...]. In his witness statement, [... ] provides a string of case numbers that he says are citations to cases registered with the Stralsund customs authorities.476 This is not sufficient justification for the claim. Claimants have presented no other documentation regarding the circumstances of the incident, and there is no basis for the Tribunal to decide that [X] or Respondent bears responsibility. Therefore, the Tribunal rejects this damages claim.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. [...] at para. 8 (Exhibit C-WS-3).\n\n**5. \"Frustrated Expenses\"**\n----------------------------\n\n395.\n\nAs noted, Claimants claim EUR [...] for \"frustrated expenses,\" *i.e.,* the EUR [...] Claimants paid to [X] at the start of the 2005 season and the cost of supplying the ship for the 2006 season477\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Memorial at para. 336.\n\n396.\n\nWith respect to the EUR [... ] payment, Claimants agreed to make the payment as part of the renegotiation with [... ] in March 2005478 The payment was at times described as an \"irrevocable loan,\"479 which the Tribunal understands to mean that it was, in fact, akin to a grant rather than a loan, which means that there is no indication that Claimants were entitled to repayment. The fact that the payment was made in the context of an attempted renegotiation of the contract does not change the nature of the payment. Claimants did not have to make the payment, but chose to do so. They could have instead taken the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the underlying contracts, but did not. While they assert that the payment was made under pressure from Respondent, even if this assertion were true, such pressure did not in itself amount to a breach of any contractual obligation or of any obligation of Respondent under the BIT.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Memorial at para. 18; *see also* Additional Agreement to the Basic Contract, 1 April 2005 (Exhibit R-28).\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimants\u2019 Memorial at para. 18; Claimants\u2019 Reply at para. 71.\n\n397.\n\nWith respect to the cost of supplying the ship, Claimants have provided an itemization of such expenses, which total EUR [..,].480 These expenses appear to be primarily for spare parts. The Tribunal recalls that, under Section II(1)(c) of the Crewing Contract, [X] was responsible for \"[p]rovision of necessary stocks, spare parts and lubricating oils.\"481 The Tribunal has already concluded that [X] was to pay for these expenses.\n\nInvoices of 2005 and 2006 concerning the expenses incurred for maintenance of the Khersones, 2005-2006 (Exhibit C-166).\n\nCrewing Contract at Section II(1)(c) (Exhibit C-33).\n\n398.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants should sue [X] for return of the supplies or related costs. However, as noted above, Respondent\u2019s actions caused [X]\u2019s failure to pay. Once harm caused by a breach of the Treaty has been proven, the existence of alternative avenues of relief is irrelevant to the quantum of compensation. An entitlement to compensation from Respondent is established as a matter of international law, regardless of whether some other entity may be jointly or severally liable for the same harm within a municipal legal order. Consequently, it was Claimants\u2019 prerogative to seek relief under the BIT rather than through local courts.\n\n399.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal awards Claimants **EUR [...]** plus interest. The Tribunal shah address the rate of interest below.\n\n**6. Loan Agreement**\n---------------------\n\n400.\n\nClaimants assert an entitlement to compensation in the amount of EUR [... ] for an outstanding loan agreed between [X] and IWS in February 2005, which was never repaid by [X], The Tribunal concludes that Respondent terminated the relationship with Claimants, and, as a result of that termination, there is no prospect that [X] will repay the loans. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that Claimants are entitled to compensation for a portion of the loan (as discussed below).\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants\u2019 argumentation and the contractual documents themselves are confused on this point. It appears that there were two separate contracts. The first contract, \"Addendum No. 1 to the [...]482 purports to identify three specific debts of [X] to IPS \"for previous periods up to 31/12/2002.\" These include: (a) EUR [... ] for a \"special payment\" to [...]; (b) EUR [...] for certain [X] debts to IPS \"up to 31/12/2002\"; and (c) EUR [...] for an amount paid by \"Inmaris\" (which the contracts defines as IWS, not IPS) related to underwater inspection of the vessel in the port of L\u00fcbeck. These amounts total EUR [...].\n\n*See* Addendum to [...], 20 February 2005 (Exhibit C-63).\n\n402.\n\nIt is not apparent from the record where these amounts are documented, other than in the *post hoc* document just mentioned. Claimants have provided a document entitled \"Additional Account [..,],\"483 which includes a special payment to [...] matching the amount in Addendum No. 1, but it then lists an amount of EUR [... ] (instead of EUR [... ] as reported in Addendum No. 1) for the [X] debt to IPS through December 2002, which results in a total of EUR [...]. Additional Account [...] does not mention the debt to IWS regarding the underwater inspection.\n\n*See* Additional Account [...] Concerning Debts of [X] to IPS (Exhibit C-60).\n\n403.\n\nIn addition, \"Addendum No. 1 to [...]\" refers to a [X] debt of EUR [...] owed to IWS for deck repairs and deck and classification works in 2004. This amount, plus the EUR [...] amount noted above, total EUR [...]. However, the document lists a \"Total\" of EUR [...].\n\n404.\n\nThe second contract was provided as Exhibit VI to the first report of Claimants\u2019 damages expert.484 This contract between IPS and [X] is dated 20 February 2005, and indicates that [X]\u2019s debt to IPS \"in the years 2002 up to 2003\" is EUR [...]. In support of this figure, the contract cites \"Addendum 1 to [...]\" dated 20 February 2005 (the document referred to above). However, the figure EUR [... ] does not correspond to any of the figures in Addendum No. 1. Claimants\u2019 damages expert explains that \"[a]ctivity in the year 2004 resulted in an increase of EUR [...] in the debt owing by the [X] to Inmaris. This value is specifically referenced in the 20 February 2005 \u2018addendum no. 1\u2019... \"485 On this basis, the expert report indicates that the amounts specified in the two contracts should match. However, they do not. As noted, the figures in \"Addendum No. 1 [...]\" total to EUR [...] (although the document erroneously reports a total of EUR [... ]).486 Adding the EUR [... ] to the EUR [... ] identified in the second contract produces the amount Claimants claim, EUR [...].\n\n*See* First [... ] Report at Exhibit VI.\n\nFirst [...] Report at para. 87.\n\n*See* Addendum to [...], 20 February 2005 (Exhibit C-63).\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to Claimants\u2019 argumentation on this point. Claimants argue that \"the loans were the contractual consequence of operational costs higher than [X]\u2019s share of revenues. The loan amounts are also based upon old debts having arisen prior to the Bareboat Charter. Claimants had to bear only the *operational* costs...,\"487 This is a critical point in Claimants\u2019 argumentation. If, as Claimants argue, the costs giving rise to the loans arose during the period when the Basic Contract was in effect, then it is conceivable that they are costs that should have been borne by [X], since each party was responsible for a certain portion of costs during that time. However, if the costs arose during the period when the Bareboat Charter was in effect, then Claimants would have been responsible for the costs given that, under the Bareboat Charter, Claimants were responsible for all costs (except winter costs) and retained all revenues. The difficulty the Tribunal faces, however, is that it is not possible to determine when the costs were incurred.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply at para. 262.\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal has already commented upon Claimants\u2019 inconsistent characterizations of the allocation of operational costs between Inmaris and [X] under the Basic Contract. This in itself complicates any analysis of whether the costs specified in the loan contracts are attributable to Claimants or [X], In addition, Claimants\u2019 statement that the loan amounts are based on old debts under the Basic Contract is at best only partially correct. As noted, \"Addendum No. 1 to [... ]\" states that EUR [... ] of the loan relates to \"debts up to 31/12/2002.\"488 Given that this agreement refers to debts through 2002, there is no way for the Tribunal to determine whether, in fact, the debts were merely carried over from the period when the Basic Contract was in effect, or whether they relate to costs incurred after that period.\n\n*See* Addendum to [...],20 February 2005 (Exhibit C-63).\n\n407.\n\nThere is no indication that the remaining loan sums relate to pre-Bareboat Charter expenses. Indeed, Addendum No. 1 expressly states that the amount of EUR [...] related to expenditures in 2004. During this period, [X] was not earning revenues on the ship\u2019s operation, and so, at least with respect to expenses incurred under the Bareboat Charter, Claimants\u2019 argument that \"the loans were the contractual consequence of operational costs higher than [X]\u2019s share of revenues\" is without merit. As explained below, the Tribunal shall award Claimants compensation for this amount, but on other grounds.\n\n408.\n\nIn light of these various infirmities in the documentation and Claimants\u2019 argumentation, the Tribunal concludes that there is insufficient evidence to award compensation for most of the loan described in \"Addendum No. 1 to [...].\" Specifically, the Tribunal cannot award damages for the payment related to [...], the alleged debts related to \"performances and deliveries from Inmaris Perestroika Sailing GmbH to [X] up to 31/12/2002,\" or the expenditure related to the underwater inspection.489\n\nAddendum to [...], 20 February 2005 (Exhibit C-63)\n\n409.\n\nHowever the Tribunal finds sufficient evidence to establish an entitlement to compensation for the fourth component listed in Addendum No. 1, expenditures for \"deck repairs, and dock and classification works on the [X]\u2019s Khersones sail training vessel for the procurement of classification certificates and additional vessel insurance in 2004.\"490 These expenses totaled EUR [...]. These are the types of activities that the Crewing Contract assigns to [X], Section II(1)(b) of the Crewing Contract states that [X] is responsible for \"[organisation and supervision of docking, repairs, reconstruction works and maintenance of classification.\"491 The Tribunal has already concluded in the factual discussion above that [X] is responsible for these costs. Consequently, the Tribunal awards Claimants damages of **EUR [...],**\n\nAddendum to [...], 20 February 2005 (Exhibit C-63).\n\n[...] Contract\u00e2t Section II(1)(b) (Exhibit C-33).\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal declines to award any interest for this amount. \"Addendum No. 1 to [...]\" does not specify any interest rate. Furthermore, while the second contract (provided as Exhibit VI to the first report of Claimants\u2019 damages expert) specifies an annual interest rate of 4.5 percent, this contract was between IPS and [X] and does not cover the EUR [... ] owed to IWS. The Tribunal recalls that Claimants agreed that any interest on the alleged EUR [...] loan should be offset in the amount of EUR [...] to reflect the First Declaration of Prolongation. Given that the Tribunal is not awarding interest on any amount of the loan, the Tribunal need not address whether an offset to interest is appropriate.\n\n**7. Lost Profits and Terminal Value**\n--------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nClaimants seek compensation for future lost profits totaling EUR [...] and terminal value of EUR [...]. The Tribunal addresses each of these damages claims below.\n\n**a. Lost Profits**\n-------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Claimants are entitled to compensation for lost profits, as Claimants had a track record of several years in which they earned a profit from the venture.\n\n413.\n\nAs explained in the factual section above, the Bareboat Charter and related contracts were to remain in force until 31 December 2009, at which point the arrangements would revert to the Basic Contract. As the Tribunal has explained, the Basic Contract would then have remained in effect until 2016, not until 2020, as Claimants contend. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of lost profits is based on this general framework. For the period between April 2006 and 2016, the Tribunal will examine the elements of the lost profits claim in turn: (1) Claimants\u2019 expected revenues; (2) Claimants\u2019 expected costs; (3) Claimants\u2019 expected profit; and (4) the applicable discount rate. The Tribunal shall address the applicable interest rate in the following section.\n\n**(i) Expected Revenues**\n-------------------------\n\n414.\n\nClaimants\u2019 expert projected future revenues, in part, based upon historical and projected revenue growth in the German cruise liner industry. After considering this testimony, the Tribunal is unable to accept this comparison. The cruise ship industry in Germany is qualitatively different from the Inmaris project, and there is insufficient basis to conclude that Claimants\u2019 business would grow in line with the growth of the cruise liner sector. Cruise ships are larger and the passenger experience is very different from the passenger experience on the Khersones.\n\n415.\n\nClaimants\u2019 expert also relied heavily for revenue projections upon Claimants\u2019 internal business plan. In particular, this plan formed the basis for a sharp increase in turnover in the first few years after 2006 (which, due to the effect of discounting, has a disproportionate effect on the final result). The Tribunal finds the business plan unconvincing because it is speculative and appears to be based on an overly optimistic expectation of growth with little evidentiary basis. The Tribunal will instead look to the project\u2019s and Claimants\u2019 own historical performance.\n\n416.\n\nSchedule 3(a) of the 9 February 2011 report of Claimants\u2019 damages expert records Claimants\u2019 revenues from the ship in 2003 (EUR [...]), 2004 (EUR [...]), and 2005 (EUR [...]). The average of these amounts is EUR [...]. The Tribunal will use this figure as a baseline. (The Tribunal has excluded from these amounts \"Other operating income\" from the ship\u2019s operation for lack of explanation or evidence as to what this income includes.) Claimants\u2019 damages expert also reported revenue figures for the period from 1999-2002,492 but the Tribunal does not believe that this period, coming as it did immediately after the reconstruction of the vessel, is indicative of future performance.493\n\n*See* Third [...] Report at para. 32 (Exhibit C-159).\n\nThe Tribunal finds it appropriate to use only the 2003-2005 period also because Claimants\u2019 damages expert uses that period in his calculations. *See* Third [...] Report at Schedules 3 and 3(a) (Exhibit C-159).\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal shall also assume that revenues grow at an annual rate of 6 percent. This figure is approximately the average of the revenue growth between 2003 and 2005. The Tribunal has excluded 2004, as it appears to be an aberration in that the revenues for that year were higher than normal due to the fact that there was an additional winter season cruise that year.494 (The Tribunal has included 2004 revenues in the calculation of average revenues as explained in the preceding paragraph because, in the view of the Tribunal, periodic upticks are to be expected, but they should not be used to distort the average expected growth over several years.)\n\n*See* Third [...] Report at para. 34 (Exhibit C-159) (explaining that 2004 \"is seen to represent a spike in revenue caused by the additional periodic winter season cruise in that year\").\n\n418.\n\nAs explained in the Tribunal\u2019s discussion of the facts above, the allocation of this revenue between Claimants and [X] differed based upon which contractual arrangements were in force. From April 2006 through 2009, while the Bareboat Contract was in force, Claimants were entitled to retain all of the revenues collected. During the subsequent period from 2010 to 2016, the Basic Contract operated, entitling Inmaris to only 40 percent of the revenues.\n\n**(ii) Expected Costs**\n-----------------------\n\n419.\n\nSchedule 3(a) of the 9 February 2011 report of Claimants\u2019 damages expert records Claimants\u2019 costs for operating the ship in 2003 (EUR [...]), 2004 (EUR [...]), and 2005 (EUR [...]). The average annual cost during this period was EUR [...]. The Tribunal shall use this figure as the base for calculating costs for the period from 2006-2009, and will adjust the cost during this period using an expected growth rate.\n\n420.\n\nIn calculating the growth rate, the Tribunal has excluded 2004. As noted above, 2004 was aberrational because there was an additional winter cruise that year. The Tribunal will, therefore, exclude 2004 for purposes of calculating the expected growth in costs over time. The average annual growth rate from 2003-2005 (excluding 2004) is 5.6 percent. The Tribunal will apply this cost for each year from 2006-2009, starting with a base cost of EUR [...].\n\n421.\n\nAs noted, the Tribunal has used 2004 to calculate the base cost, but has excluded 2004 for purposes of calculating the growth rate. This is not inconsistent, as the Tribunal explained above in the discussion of the growth rate applicable to revenues. As the period 2003-2005 is a representative historical period, it is reasonable to conclude that the revenues during this period are representative of Claimants\u2019 future performance. However, the spike in revenues in 2004 distorts the growth rates (both for costs and revenues), in that it creates the artificial impression that there was a drastic improvement in the business between 2003 and 2004, and a drastic deterioration in performance between 2004 and 2005.\n\n422.\n\nIn 2010, the cost structure would have changed as a result of the reactivation of the Basic Contract. Schedule 1 of the Third [...] Report estimates the shared expenses that would have been deducted from Gross I and the Inmaris expenses for the period 2010-2016. The Tribunal has accepted this estimate of expenses.\n\n**(iii) Expected Profit**\n-------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Tribunal has calculated the expected profit by deducting the expected costs from the expected revenues.\n\n**(iv) Discount Rate**\n----------------------\n\n424.\n\nClaimants\u2019 damages expert has suggested a discount rate of 10 percent. He did not, however, provide a meaningful justification for this figure and, during the hearing, conceded that while he used outside sources to inform his opinion, he did not apply any specific formula.495 Respondent\u2019s damages expert suggested a discount rate of 14.95 percent. She identified her sources and provided her formula.496 In contrast to the methodology of Claimants\u2019 damages export, the methodology employed by Respondent\u2019s damages expert is, at least, an objective methodology rather than mere opinion. The Tribunal will, therefore, apply a 14.95 percent discount rate to calculate the net present value of Claimants\u2019 expected profits as of April 2006.\n\n*See* Tr. 537:7-538:13.\n\nExpert Report of [...], 15 December 2010, at para. 40 (Exhibit R-56).\n\n**(v) Conclusion Regarding Lost Profits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n425.\n\nAfter applying the methodology outlined above, the Tribunal calculates Claimants\u2019 damages associated with lost profits, expressed in terms of net present value as of April 2006, to be **EUR [...],**\n\n**b. Terminal Value**\n---------------------\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no basis for awarding terminal value to Claimants. There is no basis for assuming that the contractual relationship would continue beyond 2016. Furthermore, there is no basis for assuming that Claimants would be able to enter into a similar arrangement with another ship or, even if they were and that opportunity is now gone, there is no basis for holding Respondent liable for such loss. At a minimum, awarding such damages would be entirely speculative.\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal also feels compelled to note that Claimants\u2019 argument that it is entitled to terminal value is at odds with Claimants\u2019 argument that the contractual arrangements did not establish a joint activity. Claimants would only have a continuing entitlement to a portion of the project at the end of the contractual term if some of the assets of the project were held jointly with [X], Claimants denied any such joint ownership in the context of their argument that the contracts did not establish a joint activity.\n\n**8. Moral Damages**\n--------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal declines Claimants\u2019 request for an award of moral damages. This dispute arose out of a genuine misunderstanding between the parties regarding the rights and obligations under the various contractual arrangements. While, for the reasons described above, Respondent\u2019s actions were in violation of the BIT, such actions were not malicious or driven by motives beyond the perceived need to change key components of the economic relationship between Claimants and [X], The Tribunal has awarded damages that will compensate Claimants for the commercial harm they suffered. The Tribunal does not find that any emotional or other harm Claimants may have suffered is sufficiently serious as to merit an award of additional compensation for moral damages.\n\n**9. Interest Rate**\n--------------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that an award of interest is appropriate to ensure that Claimants are made whole because interest reflects the time value of money. There are, however, exceptions to this finding. The Tribunal has already concluded that no interest should be awarded with respect to the damages associated with the insolvency claims and costs, nor with respect to the EUR [... ] outstanding loan obligation.\n\n430.\n\nAs proposed by Claimants\u2019 damages expert, with respect to the remainder of the damages award, the Tribunal awards interest at a rate of five percent, compounded annually, beginning in April 2006. The Tribunal notes that while this rate was proposed by Claimants\u2019 expert as the rate appropriate for pre-award interest,497 the Tribunal sees no reason to apply a different rate to post-award interest.\n\n*See* Third [...] Report at para. 81 (Exhibit C-159).\n\n**V. COUNTERCLAIM**\n-------------------\n\n431.\n\nRespondent has made a counterclaim for the amount of winter costs it paid during the period when the Bareboat Charter was in effect.\n\n432.\n\nThe Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide Respondent\u2019s counterclaim. Article 11 of the BIT confers on the Tribunal jurisdiction over disputes \"with regard to investments between either Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party.\" Respondent\u2019s counterclaim is a dispute between it and Claimants \"with regard to [Claimants\u2019] investments\"; further, it is a component of the larger dispute that Claimants have consented to submit to this arbitration. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s counterclaim is within the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. However, as the Tribunal explained above, [X] was responsible for the winter costs, and, therefore, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent\u2019s counterclaim on the merits.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n433.\n\nAs explained in the procedural background, Claimants sought reimbursement of EUR 910,333.47 in costs of legal representation and EUR 1,131,496.53 in other costs, as well as reimbursement of their advance payment of USD 425,000 for the costs of arbitration and any further advance payments that might need to be made, to the extent that these payments were not refunded.\n\n434.\n\nRespondent claimed USD 669,144.71 in costs of legal representation and USD 642,727.75 in other costs.\n\n435.\n\nIn its letter of 15 September 2011, Respondent commented on Claimants\u2019 lack of clarity in describing certain items in their cost submission, specifically: (i) Inmaris\u2019 management costs, consisting of the salaries of [...] and [...]; (ii) costs of legal representation by counsel whose participation in these proceedings had not been disclosed; (iii) expert fees paid to an expert whose participation in these proceedings had not been disclosed, and to [...], Inmaris\u2019 accountant and auditor, who had participated as a fact witness; and (iv) the cost of bookkeeping services for purposes of the [... ] expert reports.\n\n436.\n\nWhile Claimants prevailed in this arbitration, the facts of the dispute and the parties\u2019 own contractual relationship were complex and, at times, ambiguous. The Tribunal also notes that, due to the deficiencies in both Parties\u2019 presentations, the Tribunal was essentially forced to perform damages calculations *de novo.*\n\n437.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, the Tribunal declines to award costs to either side, and decides that each party shall bear its own costs and fees.\n\n**VII. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n438.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal:\n\na. finds that Respondent breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the BIT;\n\nb. finds the Respondent impeded the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment of Claimants\u2019 investment by means of arbitrary or discriminatory measures in breach of Article 2(3) of the BIT;\n\nc. finds that Respondent expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment without payment of compensation in breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT;\n\nd. finds that no additional finding is necessary with respect to Claimants\u2019 claims under paragraph 4 of the Additional Protocol to the BIT, as the Tribunal has already concluded that Respondent breached its obligations under Article 4 of the BIT;\n\ne. awards Claimants [...] for Claimants\u2019 insolvency claims and costs, with no interest;\n\nf. awards Claimants [...] for lost profits and frustrated expenses, plus interest at a rate of five percent compounded annually, beginning on 6 April 2006 until the date of payment;\n\ng. awards Claimants [... ] for the outstanding loan, with no interest;\n\nh. rejects all other claims by the parties; and\n\ni. decides that each party shall bear its own costs, fees, and other expenses."}]}
