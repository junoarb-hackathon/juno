Christopher Thomas (Excerpts)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nI begin by thanking to my colleagues for their patience and collegiality during the course of an extensive exchange of views.\n\n2.\n\nThis separate opinion focuses on a narrow issue of law. I concur in the result reached by my colleagues, and in their findings on the principal facts, but not with their analysis of breach.\n\n3.\n\nI agree with much of what my colleagues have said and in particular their observation that: \"*a thin line exists between indirect expropriation and non-expropriatory abusive conduct that has an adverse effect on the economic value of the investment.*1 My objective is to attempt to properly situate that line on the facts of this case, having regard to the terms of the Treaty.\n\nAward, \u00b6 319.\n\n4.\n\nMy concerns are that in finding that SPI suffered an indirect expropriation2, the majority has given insufficient weight to both: (i) SPI's admissions that neither it, nor its Hungarian subsidiary, had any right to a particular taxation treatment of the meal vouchers on which its Hungarian business was based; and (ii) the effect of a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) which condemned the same measures as are at issue in this arbitration.\n\nAward, \u00b6 328.\n\n**The Facts**\n-------------\n\n5.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n8.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n13.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nFrom 2009 onwards, due to the financial crisis and the change in taxation\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n20.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n30.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**The Issue**\n-------------\n\n31.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 4, I see two weaknesses with labelling what the Respondent did as effecting an *indirect* expropriation. The first weakness is the fact that neither SPI nor its subsidiary had any legal right to a particular taxation treatment of their voucher offerings. SPI freely acknowledged this to be the case:\n\n\u2022 \"SPI does not claim [...] that it had any 'contract or any other type of commitment guaranteeing [...] access to a market, market share, a particular volume of business, let alone guaranteed returns.'\"32\n\n\u2022 \"Claimant does not allege that it had a vested right to the continuance of certain tax treatment.\"33\n\n\u2022 Indeed, SPI conceded that no expropriation claim would lie if the regime were to be done away with entirely. To be sure, SPI qualified this concession by stating that to constitute a \"lawful regulation\" the tax benefits would have to be eliminated \"entirely\" or limited \"equally\" and such reform would have to be justified by \"a proven public purpose that was proportionate to its aims, and not imbued with improper intent against Claimant\".34 In principle, however, it accepted that it had no legal right to an expectation that the voucher business would continue.\n\nReply\", \u00b6 253.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 21: \"Had Respondent eliminated the tax benefits granted to meal voucher [*sic*] entirely or elected to regulate all meal voucher issuers equally by limiting commission levels that could be charged to employers and affiliates, and such reform was justified by a proven public purpose that was proportionate to its aims, and not imbued with improper intent against Claimant, it would have been a lawful regulation.\" [internal footnote removed].\n\n32.\n\nMy colleagues do not share my view that this weakens the indirect expropriation claim. They consider that SPI's shareholding in SPH suffices to establish a property right capable of supporting a finding of indirect expropriation.35 They rely upon the CJEU's findings of disproportionality and inadequate justification of the measures in arriving at their finding:\n\n323. In *Commissioner v. Hungary,* the CJEU found that the SZ\u00c9P and Ersz\u00e9bet regulations [*sic*] were disproportionate to Hungary's stated aims of protecting users and creditors, not justified by these stated aims, and discriminated against foreign issuers. While the EU regulations at issue in that case differ from the BIT provisions, the CJEU's analysis of discrimination, proportionality, and the alleged public purpose of the tax reforms are highly relevant to this case.36\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\nAward, \u00b6 323.\n\n33.\n\nI do not think that the CJEU's findings on discrimination and disproportionality, *etc.* gets the Tribunal home on indirect expropriation and I shall seek to explain why I do not agree that proof of ownership of shares suffices to demonstrate an indirect expropriation on the facts of this case.\n\n34.\n\n*First,* proof of discriminatory or unjustifiable acts does not convert something that is not an expropriation into an expropriation, even if substantial losses result from such measures.37 This can be seen in the *Fireman's Fund* and *Feldman* cases.38 In those cases, the value of the claimant's investment was either rendered worthless by the State's measure(s) *(Fireman's Fund)* or substantially diminished due to the loss of the company's principal business *(Feldman).* Nevertheless, in both cases the tribunals rejected the argument that an expropriation had been effected.\n\nThe *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v. United Mexican States* tribunal made this point in precise terms at \u00b6 205 of its Award: \"First, discriminatory treatment is used to determine whether the expropriation was unlawful. In the *LIAMCO* case, quoted by FFIC, the tribunal considered that \"a purely discriminatory nationalization is illegal and wrongful\" under international law. However, it presupposes the presence of a nationalization (or expropriation). In the present case, the question is whether there was expropriation. It cannot be argued that because there is discrimination, there is expropriation.\" [Emphasis added.] *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/1, Award, 17 July 2006 (*Fireman's Fund*\").\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002 (\"*Feldman v. Mexico\"* / *Feldman*) (CL-0097).\n\n35.\n\n*Second*, attempts to argue that ownership of shares suffices to justify an indirect expropriation claim in circumstances similar to the present case have been rejected by tribunals for reasons that I will review below.\n\n36.\n\nTo be clear, shares in a company are a species of property protected by the Treaty. A State can directly expropriate an investor\u2019s shares or take measures short of that which cause such an impairment of the normal incidents of ownership and control as to amount to an indirect expropriation of the shares.\n\n37.\n\nTo illustrate the distinction, if a State takes the investor\u2019s shares away from it, it has expropriated them (or nationalized them if the taking is part of a larger set of measures aimed at other investors). It might also take measures against the exercise of rights relating to the shares which impair the rights of ownership and control. In addition, a State might take measures that do not interfere with the rights of ownership and control over a subsidiary, but which interfere with other legal rights held by the investor or its subsidiary. A common example is where an investor incorporates a company to hold a concession granted by the host State and the State later takes measures that destroy the concession, thereby depriving the local company of its reason for being and thereby substantially diminishing or eliminating the value of the investor\u2019s shareholding in the local company. That can support a finding of indirect expropriation.\n\n38.\n\nThus, the cases first look for measures relating to the ownership and control of the shares. If, as in the present case, the State takes no action directed towards the shares themselves, the analysis then turns to whether measures were taken in relation to *other* legal rights, belonging either to the investor or to the company in which it holds the shares, which rights have been impaired.\n\n39.\n\nIn *Feldman,* the claimant owned and controlled a Mexican company, CEMSA. The company\u2019s business of buying cigarettes and then exporting them and claiming VAT rebates was shut down by Mexico\u2019s finance authorities. The claimant alleged among other things that Mexico\u2019s measures had resulted in an indirect or \"creeping\" expropriation of his investment and were tantamount to expropriation.39 The tribunal rejected the argument, holding:\n\n152. Given that the Claimant here has lost the effective ability to export cigarettes, and any profits derived therefrom, application of the *Pope & Talbot* standard might suggest the possibility of an expropriation. However, as with *S.D. Myers,* it may be questioned as to whether the Claimant ever possessed a \"right\" to export that has been \"taken\" by the Mexican government. Also, here, as in *Pope & Talbot,* the regulatory action (enforcement of long-standing provisions of Mexican law) has not deprived the Claimant of control of the investment, CEMSA, interfered directly in the internal operations of CEMSA or displaced the Claimant as the controlling shareholder. The Claimant is free to pursue other continuing lines of export trading, such as exporting alcoholic beverages, photographic supplies, or other products for which he can obtain from Mexico the invoices required under Article 4, although he is effectively precluded from exporting cigarettes. Thus, this Tribunal believes there has been no \"taking\" under this standard articulated in *Pope & Talbot,* in the present case.40 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Feldman,* \u00b6 89.\n\n*Feldman,* \u00b6 152.\n\n40.\n\nThe same distinction was drawn in *Emmis v. Hungary41* and *Accession Mezzanine v. Hungary*42, where the tribunals held that if no measures were taken against the shares themselves, the claimants had to establish that they, or their Hungarian subsidiaries, held other rights or assets that had been taken or so interfered with such as to support a finding of expropriation of the shares.43\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B. V. and others v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award, 16 April 2014 (Exhibit RL-0012) (*Emmis v. Hungary,* Award\" / \"*Emmis*\"). I was a member of this tribunal. The applicable treaties were the Netherlands-Hungary and the Switzerland-Hungary bilateral investment treaties; both had narrow arbitration clauses.\n\n*Accession Mezzanine Capital L.P. and Danubius Keresked\u00f6h\u00e1z Vagyonkezel\u0151 Zrt. v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/3, Award, 17 April 2015 (\"*Accession Mezzanine*\").\n\nIn *Emmis* the claimants continued to own shares in their Hungarian enterprise, Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3 M\u0171sorszolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Zrt. (\"Sl\u00e1ger\"), and in *Accession Mezzanine* the claimants continued to own shares in their Hungarian enterprise, Danubius R\u00e1di\u00f3 M\u0171sorzolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Zrt. (\"Danubius\").\n\n41.\n\nBoth tribunals considered whether claims could be advanced in relation to actions taken by the respondent in respect of two Hungarian broadcasting companies. Each company had held a broadcasting licence for a specified period, which licence was extended in accordance with its terms, after which it expired. In each case, the licence was put out to tender and awarded to another company. The claimants alleged that the tendering process was not conducted lawfully or fairly and failed to accord them an \"incumbent advantage\" in the bidding process. The claimants in both cases argued that they or their subsidiaries held extant rights that, if honoured, would have led to the granting of licences. In order to determine whether an alleged interference with these claimed rights could give rise to an indirect expropriation of the claimants' shares in their Hungarian companies, the tribunals had first to determine whether the claimed rights actually existed under Hungarian law.44\n\n*Accession Mezzanine,* \u00b6\u00b6 53, 107, 116-129; *Emmis,* \u00b6\u00b6 222-240.\n\n42.\n\nMy colleagues distinguish *Emmis* on the ground that:\n\n212. The majority of the Tribunal considers as particularly misplaced Respondent's reference to *Emmis v. Hungary,* on which the separate and dissenting opinion also relies. Respondent has cited the case for the proposition that the claimant must have a vested property right or asset in order to justify a claim of indirect expropriation. *Emmis v. Hungary* concerned a national FM-radio frequency broadcasting license which allegedly constituted rights under Hungarian property law created by a broadcasting agreement. In *Emmis v. Hungary,* the action was to protect contract rights, not to seek compensation for shareholding interests as such. By contrast, the present arbitration implicates rights related to the taking of shares.\n\n213. The contractual rights at stake in *Emmis v. Hungary* did not exist at the time relevant to the claim. At the time in question, all that the claimants had was an invitation to tender for a possible renewal of the license. The measures taken by the state affected rights that had already expired. Even if the value of the property was greatly diminished, the acts of the state could not cause such effect as they did not affect rights that were in force at the time the measures were taken.\n\n213. Unlike in *Emmis v. Hungary,* in the instant arbitration, SPI owned shareholdings in SPH at the time of the PIT reforms and the alleged expropriation. The facts of *Emmis v. Hungary* are thus sufficiently distinct from the instant case that it is not applicable here.45 [Emphasis added; footnote references omitted]\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 213-215.\n\n43.\n\nI respectfully disagree, particularly with the underlined text in the pages just quoted. As in the present case, the applicable treaties in *Emmis* and *Accession Mezzanine* each defined shares as an \"asset\" falling within the definition of an \"investment\".46 Also, as in the present case, both cases involved Hungarian enterprises in which the claimants held shares and the claimants contended that their ownership of shares sufficed to constitute vested rights.47 Taking the approach generally taken in the cases which I have already described, in both cases the mere ownership of shares in a subsidiary was *not* accepted as sufficient to ground an indirect expropriation claim.48 *Accession Mezzanine* held:\n\nIn the present case, the property rights said to be the object of the Claimants' first expropriation claim are the shares in and loans to Danubius. There is no allegation in these proceedings that a measure of the State of Hungary has interfered with the Claimants' right of use in respect of these property rights.49 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Emmis,* \u00b6 135, citing the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Netherlands and Hungary dated 2 September 1987 (\"Netherlands-Hungary BIT\"), Article 1(1) and the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Switzerland and Hungary dated 5 October 1988 (\"Swiss-Hungary BIT\"), Article 1(2); *Accession Mezzanine,* \u00b6 24 citing the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Hungarian People\u2019s Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 9 March 1987 (\"UK-Hungary BIT\"), Article 1(1).\n\nIn *Accession Mezzanine,* the Claimants advanced two arguments: First, Claimants contend that Hungary indirectly expropriated the full value of the shares of Danubius and destroyed its ability to repay loans from Claimants. Second, Claimants contend that Hungary also expropriated the bundle of proprietary and contractual rights that Danubius enjoyed by virtue of the Contract Framework that Hungary created in the 1990s to encourage and protect investors in the newly-privatized broadcast industry.\" (*Accession Mezzanine* Award, \u00b6 61). Further, the Claimants assessed their loss in respect of the first expropriation claim as the value of Danubius as a going concern as a radio operator\" (\u00b6 171).  \nIn *Emmis,* the Claimants similarly submitted that they jointly hold 100 percent of the shares in Sl\u00e1ger, and those shares are assets\" that qualify as a covered investment\" under both the applicable BITs and the ICSID Convention\", and that indirect expropriation may affect a broad range of intangible assets with economic value, including inter alia shares in a company, and tangible and intangible rights held by an investment vehicle\" (*Emmis v. Hungary*, Award, \u00b6 47).\n\nIn *Accession Mezzanine,* the tribunal found at \u00b6 171 of the Award:  \nWhilst the object of the expropriation is said to be the value of the shares in and the loans to Danubius, that value has been assessed by the Claimants as reflecting the value of Danubius as a going concern. But to continue as a going concern, Danubius needed a right to broadcast.\"  \nIn that respect, the tribunal found at \u00b6\u00b6 187-188 that no legislative provision or provision of any other normative act relating to the conduct of the 2009 Tender was incorporated into the Broadcasting Agreement such that Danubius would have a contractual right to enforce any such provision against the ORTT or any other party\", that the Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim was contingent upon establishing a right to a new broadcasting agreement under Hungarian law\", and therefore it had no jurisdiction because the true object of the expropriation claim is not part of the Claimants\u2019 investment in Hungary\".  \nSimilarly, in *Emmis,* the tribunal stated at \u00b6\u00b6 159-161 that: [i]n view of the fact that the only cause of action within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is that of expropriation, Claimants must have held a property right of which they have been deprived\", and that the need to identify a proprietary interest that has been taken [was] confirmed by the definition of 'investment\u2019 in the Treaties\" which referred to every kind of asset\".  \nFurther, the tribunal found at \u00b6 219 that on the facts, although Claimants\u2019 contemporaneous accounting treatment of the Broadcasting Right confirms that it was indeed a valuable asset during the period of the licence and its first renewal\", the Claimants attributed a nil value to that asset in respect of the period after 18 November 2009\". Thus, it concluded at \u00b6 221 that the 2007 Broadcasting Agreement conferred in general no rights in respect of the period after 18 November 2009 constituting valuable assets capable of expropriation\".\n\n*Accession Mezzanine*, \u00b6 179.\n\n44.\n\nAnd further:\n\nThe Tribunal thus affirms, following an analysis of the precedents relied upon by the Claimants, that their first expropriation claim is, like their second expropriation claim, contingent upon procuring a new broadcasting agreement from the ORTT. The dispute concerning the first expropriation claim does not, therefore, arise out of the Claimants\u2019 investment in shares and loans but rather out of an alleged investment right that the Claimants never had. The Tribunal thus upholds the Respondent\u2019s objection [B2] in respect of the Claimants\u2019 first expropriation claim.50 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 185.\n\n45.\n\nThe tribunal concluded that the claimants never had any rights to the alleged object of the expropriation.51 Their ownership of shares did not suffice. Hence the claimants were in the same position as the present Claimant. My colleagues contrast the present case to the situation in *Emmis* because it is said to \"implicate[] rights related to the taking of shares\". But what rights related to the taking of shares have been \"implicated\"? As already seen, the Claimant has forthrightly and correctly conceded that it had no rights beyond its ownership of its shares and there was no measure taken in relation to SPI\u2019s shareholding in SPH. It was thus in precisely the same position as the *Emmis* and *Accession Mezzanine* claimants.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 \u00b6 188-189.\n\n46.\n\nFor example, in *Emmis,* the claimants asserted that it \"is well-established as a matter of international law that indirect expropriation may affect a broad range of intangible assets with economic value, including *inter alia* shares in a company, and tangible and intangible rights held by an investment vehicle.\"52 But the tribunal held that there was no expropriation (direct or indirect) of the shares in the claimants\u2019 Hungarian company and therefore \"the only way that the expropriation claim can be held to be within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is if Sl\u00e1ger [the subsidiary] had a proprietary right that survived the expiry of its broadcasting right under that Agreement.\"53 This could not be shown.\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions quoted at \u00b6 47 of the *Emmis* Award.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 144.\n\n47.\n\nThese two cases are, in my respectful opinion, directly on point. Applying their reasoning to the instant case, if the Claimant cannot identify a right to a particular taxation treatment that would constitute an \"asset\" or a \"right\" under the France-Hungary Treaty, it has no claim for indirect expropriation.\n\n48.\n\nI turn to what I see as the second weakness in the finding that Hungary indirectly expropriated SPI\u2019s shares in SPH. This arises out of events following the Com\u00ed of Justice\u2019s condemnation of the restrictions imposed with respect to the SZ\u00c9P card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher.\n\n49.\n\nTo set this in its proper context, it is necessary to briefly summarize the relevant facts:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n50.\n\nIt is striking that although the *Edenred* tribunal ruled in December 2016 that Edenred had suffered an expropriation, one month *before* that finding the Respondent\u2019s expert in our proceeding, [REDACTED] filed its Second Expert Report showing that Edenred had developed a new card that it was advertising in Hungary would provide \"all benefits in one place\" and be accepted by approximately 100,000 affiliates in Hungary.55 An image of the new card was adduced as Exhibit [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] Second Expert Report.56\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report; DLA Piper, \"Simplify cafeteria and incentive systems with Edenred, 2016-2017 (Exhibit [REDACTED]), p. 6.\n\n*Id.,* p. 6.\n\n51.\n\nThere was no dispute between the Parties about Edenred\u2019s competing in Hungary by the time of our hearing in May 2017. SPI's damages expert, [REDACTED], acknowledged that he was aware of this fact.57\n\nTranscript, Day 3, p. 606, lines 20-22; p. 607, lines 1-12.\n\n52.\n\nThus, the company that the *Edenred* tribunal held had been expropriated was advertising a new card in Hungary *before* the expropriation finding was made.58 As in the present case, the ownership and control of Edenred\u2019s shares in its Hungarian subsidiary had never been touched by any measure taken by Hungary. Therefore, after the CJEU held that the terms of competition must be restored, Edenred resumed competing in the Hungarian voucher market.59\n\nEdenred S.A. v. Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/21 Award, \u00b6\u00b6 419-420. [Emphasis added.] I hold the members of this Tribunal in high regard. It appears to me that although the Tribunal, like me, differentiated between three categories of measures (at \u00b6 316 of the award and as discussed in this opinion), it then equated dispossession with indirect expropriation. I believe that they are different concepts.\n\nThe Respondent noted in its Post-Hearing Brief, at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, [REDACTED]\n\n53.\n\nThis fact not only raises serious doubts as to whether Edenred suffered a permanent taking of its shares in its Hungarian subsidiary (since the subsidiary was able to resume business)60, but also points to a key issue of quantum: If, having found an expropriation, a tribunal awards damages based on lost cash flows projected into the future - as in the present case, where they are projected in perpetuity by the Claimant\u2019s expert61- what happens when the conditions that formed the basis for the expropriation finding no longer exist and the company can resume business?62 Assuming that an expropriation finding can even be made, it must follow that a claimant is overcompensated when what was assumed to be a permanent taking turns out at its highest to be a temporary one.63\n\nThe Respondent pointed this out repeatedly. See, for example, its Post-Hearing Brief at footnote 37, where it criticized the *Edenred* tribunal as follows; \"It is for this reason too that the *Edenred* tribunal reached the wrong conclusion in finding that the right impacted was the \"enterprise.\" The tribunal erred in its conclusion that Edenred was deprived of its enterprise given, in particular, that Edenred continued to operate profitably at the time of the award, and continues to do so in Hungary today. Edenred, paras. 308, 381and 05/02/17 Tr. 266:22 (Sedl\u00e1k) acknowledging that Edenred is still in the market).\"\n\n[REDACTED] First Expert Report, \u00b6 127; Second Expert Report of [REDACTED], Appendix 10.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nA small number of tribunals have contemplated the possibility of finding a temporary expropriation, but to the best of my knowledge, the only two that have deviated from the weight of the case law which requires the showing of a permanent taking are *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Award, 7 July 2011, and *Les Laboratoires Servier S.A.S., et al v. Republic of Poland,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 14 February 2012 (*Les Laboratoires Servier*\") (CL-0055). (The tribunal\u2019s discussion of the applicable provision\u2019s reaching a temporary dispossession is followed by a redacted passage in the publicly available version of the award, so it is not possible to see what the balance of the tribunal\u2019s thinking was on this important point.) When tribunals consider the temporary versus permanent point, they have generally found that it must be permanent. In its detailed summary of the case law on expropriation, the *Fireman\u2019s Fund* tribunal stated at \u00b6 176(d): \"The taking must be permanent, and not ephemeral or temporary\"; *Tecmed v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, \u00b6 116; *Azurix v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, \u00b6 313; *LG&E v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, \u00b6 193; *Archer Daniel Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients (Americas) Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/5, Award, 21 November 2007, \u00b6 243; *Unglaube v. Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/20, Award, 16 May 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 226-227; *Achmea v. Slovak Republic I,* PCA Case No. 2008-13, Final Award, 7 December 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 289-293; *Pezold v. Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, Award, 28 July 2015, \u00b6 516; *Busta v. Czech Republic,* SCC Case No. V 2015/014, Final Award, 10 March 2017, \u00b6 389.\n\n**My Approach**\n---------------\n\n54.\n\nThe highly unusual facts of this case led me to initially view the present claim as a fair and equitable treatment / discrimination claim that was being \"shoehorned\" into an expropriation claim (because the Tribunal only has jurisdiction over measures of dispossession under the Treaty). Whatever had been done to SPI\u2019s Hungarian business, it did not for the reasons given appear to me to be an indirect expropriation of SPI's shareholding in SPH.\n\n55.\n\nBut having reflected on the unusual wording of Article 5, I concluded that the Parties' use of the term \"expropriation\" rather than \"dispossession\" had led me (wrongly) to equate the two concepts. Labelling Article 5(2) as the Treaty's \"expropriation clause\" is misconceived because Article 9(2), from which the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction, speaks *not* of \"disputes relating to measures of expropriation\", but rather to \"disputes relating to the measures of dispossession referred to in Article 5(2)\". I thus concluded that I had given insufficient attention to the clause's structure and breadth.\n\n56.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the France-Hungary Treaty encompasses more than measures of expropriation and nationalization. It provides in its opening words:\n\nThe Contracting Parties shall not take expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures the effect of which is to deprive, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Party of investments belonging to them in its territory and in its maritime zones...64 [Underlining added.]\n\nTreaty, Article 5(2). Throughout this proceeding, the Parties have employed an English translation of the Treaty which is authentic in the French and Magyar versions. Since there was no dispute between the Parties concerning the Treaty\u2019s use of three types of measures *(i.e.,* expropriation, nationalization, or any other measures the effect of which is to dispossess, directly or indirectly, investors of their investments...), I have proceeded on the basis that the English translation accurately reflects not only the French version (which is freely available) but the Magyar version as well.\n\n57.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief SPI asserted that this phrasing *extends* the reach of the clause beyond measures of expropriation or nationalization.65 I agree that that is the correct reading of the clause. While many other treaties include language to clarify that measures \"*equivalent to*\" or \"*having the same nature as*\" measures of expropriation or nationalization will also fall within the ambit of the clause, the Treaty in the instant case goes further to introduce a third category of measures that is not tied to equivalency to or having the same nature as expropriation or nationalization but rather reaches measures the effect of which is to deprive, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Party of investments belonging to them.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, the Claimant took issue with the Respondent\u2019s attempt to use the verb *\"dispossess\"* to *narrow* the scope of Article 5(2): \"27. ...Respondent latches on to the BIT reference to 'dispossess\u2019 to argue that \"although largely similar to expropriation, the requirement to demonstrate dispossession imposes a higher standard.\" According to Respondent, France and Hungary specifically intended to protect only against dispossession measures, which Respondent referred to as \"the kind of big ones,\" which cause claimant to lose control or management over its investment.\" This led the Claimant to assert in response that: \"28. Not only does Respondent fail to provide any support of specific intent by France and Hungary to narrow the scope of BIT protection, its argument is also irreconcilable with the plain language of the BIT. For one, as the BIT prohibits 'measures of [expropriation] or nationalization or any other measures which have the effect of dispossessing,\u2019 France and Hungary extended BIT protection against 'measures which have the effect of dispossessing\u2019 *in addition* to expropriation and nationalization. Second, the BIT is broadly worded to protect against 'any other measures which have the effect of dispossessing,\u2019 *not* 'measures which dispossess by taking over control or management,\u2019 as Hungary would like.\" [Italics in original; footnote references omitted.]\n\n58.\n\nGiven that different words used in a treaty are generally taken to mean different things, the use of the word *\"deprive\"* in Article 5(2) must be taken as intended to reach measures that are not expropriations or nationalizations (either direct or indirect). The article includes, but is not limited to, measures of expropriation and nationalization, and in my opinion reaches measures that although not *\"equivalent to\"* expropriation or nationalization would nevertheless have the effect of dispossessing an investor of its investment. On this approach, a dispossession could occur if it were to be of such a nature as to deprive the investor of the value or utility of its investment without actually interfering with its legal rights. Accordingly, on the facts of this case I would hold that the impugned measures dispossessed SPI of its subsidiary's Hungarian voucher business, on which most of SPH's business, and hence, most of SPH's value to SPI, in turn, depended.\n\n59.\n\nI would therefore hold that for the period of market disruption (which ended around the time of Edenred's introduction of a new card - showing Edenred's belief that the terms of competition were being restored) the Respondent marginalized the formerly dominant market players and effectively deprived SPI of the value of SPH's participation in the voucher business. While neither SPI or SPH had a proprietary right to such business under Hungarian law, they had a reasonable expectation to continued participation in that business if the State continued to permit vouchers to be used to supplement employee remuneration.\n\n60.\n\nBut the absence of any legal right to such continued participation surely has to reduce the degree of certainty of that participation (in contrast to a situation in which the investor or its investment has a defined legal right that has been impaired or taken away). As noted above at paragraphs 11 to 15, the evidence shows that the uncontested changes made to the voucher taxation regime in 2010-2011 led to an approximately 11% and 5% reduction in the volume of issued vouchers, respectively, for those two years. The voucher taxation preferences could be done away completely with in appropriate conditions. This puts the valuation of the meal voucher business in a very different position than that of other businesses which do not depend upon the continued existence of a government regime that is susceptible to change and in respect of which the State has given no commitments to the investor as to the regime\u2019s continuance.\n\n61.\n\nIn the end, three factors give rise to a right to compensation for this temporary dispossession: (i) the rapidity with which Hungary intentionally tilted the terms of competition away from the dominant market players; (ii) the virtually immediate, serious and predictable impact of the measures on SPH\u2019s existing business; and (iii) the obviously serious questions as to the measures\u2019 consistency with EU law which were, or should have been, evident to the Respondent at the time.\n\n62.\n\nIn sum, the wording of Article 5(2) is capacious enough to permit the Tribunal to find a breach, not because Hungary directly or indirectly expropriated SPI\u2019s shares in SPH, but rather because through design and effect, Hungary engineered a dispossession of the voucher business from which SPI\u2019s subsidiary derived most of its value. This was done without taking away or interfering with any of SPI\u2019s or SPH\u2019s legal rights.\n\n63.\n\nI therefore agree with the result, but respectfully disagree with the finding of an indirect expropriation. I would allow the claim on the narrower basis described above, with due recognition that the measure was of a temporary nature and thus would adjust the damages to be awarded to reflect that fact.\n\n**The** ***Achmea*** **Issue**\n------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nA few words about the *Achmea* judgment. I agree with the majority that the *Achmea* judgment does not deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction over the claim. While Hungary\u2019s accession to the European Union might have raised questions of incompatibility with the EU\u2019s legal system of a bilateral treaty which originally applied between an EU Member State and a third State, in my opinion it is difficult to sustain the argument that the CJEU\u2019s judgment operates to deprive an ICSID tribunal of a jurisdiction which by all relevant criteria (under the ICSID system) existed at the time that the dispute was submitted to ICSID arbitration. I understand the argument to be that under EU law the two Contracting Parties' consents to ICSID arbitration became invalid as of the date of Hungary's accession to the EU. This raises the question of how legal developments within the EU can affect the operation of a separate and autonomous international treaty.\n\n65.\n\nThe ICSID Convention is of course a multilateral treaty to which both Hungary and France are Contracting States. Article 9(2) of the BIT designated ICSID as the forum for investor-State disputes if both Contracting Parties acceded to the Convention.66 France ratified the Convention on 21 August 1967 and Hungary on 4 February 1987; it entered into force for the former on 20 September 1967 and for the latter on 6 May 1987.67 Accordingly, both Contracting Parties gave their treaty-based consents to ICSID arbitration well before Hungary joined the European Union.\n\nArticle 9(2), third paragraph, states in this regard: \"When each of the Contracting Parties becomes a party to the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes Concerning Investments Between States and Nationals of Other States, done at Washington on March 18th, 1965, such a dispute shall, if it cannot be settled amicably within six months from the time it was raised by one of the parties to the dispute, be submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration.\"\n\nhttps://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/about/Database-of-Member-States.aspx\n\n66.\n\nWith their prior offers in writing never withdrawn or modified by the two Contracting Parties when Hungary became a Member State, insofar as the ICSID system was concerned, it remained only for a French or Hungarian investor to match the other State's prior consent by giving its own consent in writing in the terms specified by the BIT for an agreement to arbitrate to be formed under Article 25 of the Convention.68 At that point, insofar as the ICSID Convention was concerned, a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement would come into effect. So far as I can see, nothing in the Convention recognizes that a judgment of a court having jurisdiction within an ICSID Contracting State that has already given its consent to ICSID arbitration can undo such an arbitration agreement, even if that court plays a supranational role within a regional legal system.\n\nArticle 25(1) states in this regard: \"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\" It is well established that under the Convention, it is not necessary that the parties\u2019 consents be given at the same time.\n\n67.\n\nHad France and Hungary agreed that their respective investors' rights to claim under the BIT would cease to exist once Hungary became an EU Member State - a limitation on their prior treaty-based consents that could easily comport with the ICSID Convention - the situation would be different. They would have provided in advance for the withdrawal of their respective consents upon the occurrence of a specified event (the accession of Hungary to the EU). But this was not done.\n\n68.\n\nOn well-established principle, the Convention contemplates that jurisdiction is to be established at the time that a claim is submitted to arbitration. If both parties have given their consent in writing, the agreement is formed and the final sentence of Article 25(1) makes clear that: \"When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"69 Therefore, I do not think that a consent given by an EU Member State to an investor of another Member State which was valid in ICSID terms at the time of the submission of the dispute to arbitration can be varied or nullified by a subsequent development in EU law which declares intra-EU BITs' arbitration clauses to be inconsistent with the EU regime, even if that judgment operates *ex tunc* within that regime.\n\nI realize that it can be argued that strictly speaking the Respondent is not seeking to \"withdraw its consent *unilaterally* because it can be said to be acting pursuant to a binding determination made by the CJEU which has binding effect within all EU Member States. But in terms of the present arbitration, the CJEU\u2019s decision as articulated by and through the agency of the Respondent would, if accepted, have the same effect.\n\n69.\n\nOn a separate point, I note that the stated policy concern in *Achmea* was that an arbitral tribunal with no power to refer questions of EU law to the CJEU might err in its application of EU law. That concern does not arise on the facts of the present case. The Tribunal has in fact given full effect to the Court of Justice's ruling in *Commissioner v. Hungary*, by relying upon the Court's findings on the various restrictions pertaining to the SZ\u00c9P card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher frameworks. In this way, the Award is congruent with what the Court found in respect of the very measures at issue in this case and no inconsistency with *substantive* EU law appears to exist.\n\n70.\n\nI recognize that there is an additional concern that the existence of intra-EU investor-State arbitration poses issues in relation to the \"duty of loyalty\" that EU law imposes on each Member State. The remedy granted by this Tribunal is not the remedy that the Court granted and the idea that different remedies can be granted by different adjudicative bodies considering the same measures might give rise to concern. But that is for the EU and its Member States to sort out. It is not for an ICSID tribunal to resolve within a particular case where jurisdiction was established at the time that the claim was submitted to arbitration.\n\n71.\n\nIn the end, I do not think that the CJEU\u2019s judgment can vary the obligations of two EU Member States that are also ICSID Contracting States. The Convention is a separate treaty which established an autonomous arbitral regime that operates purely at the level of international law, disconnected from the national legal systems of its Contracting States.70 It is to be construed and applied on its own terms.\n\nDate: 19 January 2019\n\nExcept insofar as the courts of each Contracting States are obliged to enforce ICSID awards as if they are a final judgment of the courts of that State, See Article 54(1)."}], "Content": "Award (Excerpts)\n----------------\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings April 2006 |\n| Beneficial Aggregate Tax Rate | Aggregate Tax Rate applicable to Fringe Benefits payable on the actual value of the Fringe Benefits |\n| BIT | Treaty between the Government of the Republic of France and Hungary Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (signed on 6 November 1986) |\n| BVI | Business Volume Issued |\n| BVR | Business Volume Reimbursed |\n| C-[#] | Claimant\u2019s Exhibit |\n| CJEU | Court of Justice of the European Union |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis present dispute has been submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Treaty between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic of Hungary Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 30 September 1987 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nClaimant Sodexo Pass International SAS (\"Sodexo\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company incorporated under the laws of France, has been represented, as noted above, by Mr. Philippe Cavalieros, Ms. Janet (Hyun Jeong) Kim, Dr. Andr\u00e1s Szecskay, Dr. Andr\u00e1s D\u00e1niel L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (until 1 February 2018), and Dr. Gy\u00f6rgy Wellmann.\n\n3.\n\nRespondent Hungary (Magyarorsz\u00e1g) (the \"Respondent\") has been represented, as noted above, by Ms. Kiera S. Gans, Ms. Natasha Kanerva, Mr. Andr\u00e1s Nemescs\u00f3i, and Mr. David Kohegyi.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute relates to tax reforms undertaken by Hungary between 2010 and 2013 which subjected meal vouchers, such as the ones offered by the Claimant, to the tax treatment that affected Claimant\u2019s investment in Hungary.\n\n**A. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n**(1) Overview**\n----------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 July 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from Sodexo against Hungary, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-18, and Legal Authorities CL-1 through CL-9 (the \"Request\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 August 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of William W. Park, a national of the United States and Switzerland, as President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Andrea Carlevaris, a national of Italy, appointed by the Claimant; and John Christopher Thomas, a national of Canada, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n10.\n\nOn 7 April 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. A\u00efssatou Diop, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 26 May 2015 by teleconference.\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 17 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters, together with Annex A detailing a Procedural Timetable for the proceedings (the \"Procedural Timetable\"). Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be London, United Kingdom, unless from a costs perspective, it would be more suitable to hold the hearing in Washington D.C., United States.\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, recording the agreement of the Parties that the Hearing on the Merits would be held in Washington D.C., from 1-5 May 2017.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant submitted its Memorial on the Merits on 1 October 2015, together with Exhibits C-19 through C-54, Legal Authorities CL-10 through CL-125, the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated 4 September 2015, the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated 27 August 2017, the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated 15 September 2015, the Expert Report of [REDACTED] dated 1 October 2015, and the Expert Opinion of [REDACTED] dated 23 September 2015\n\n15.\n\nOn 29 January 2016, Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, together with Exhibits R-1 through R-45, Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-108, the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated 29 January 2016, the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated 29 January 2016, the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated 22 January 2016, and the Expert Report of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] dated 29 January 2016, with accompanying Exhibits [REDACTED] through [REDACTED] and Appendix A through Appendix D.\n\n16.\n\nOn 26 February 2016 and 15 April 2016, Respondent and Claimant, respectively submitted their document production requests to the Tribunal. The Tribunal issued its decision on the requests in Procedural Order No. 3 dated 5 May 2016.\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 August 2016, Claimant submitted its Reply on the Merits and Quantum dated August 8, together with Exhibits C-55 through C-95, Legal Authorities CL-126 through CL-157, and the Rebuttal Report of [REDACTED] dated 8 August 2016, with accompanying Exhibits AF.1.1 through AF18.2, and Appendix 1 through Appendix 14.\n\n18.\n\nOn 17 October 2016, Respondent requested and Claimant agreed to a one week-extension to the Procedural Timetable to file its Rejoinder. On 14 November 2016, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder, together with Exhibits R-46 through R-74, Legal Authorities RL-109 through RL-161, the Second Expert Report of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] with accompanying Exhibits [REDACTED] through [REDACTED], and Appendix E.\n\n19.\n\nOn 14 February 2017, the President of the Tribunal held, on behalf of the Tribunal, a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference. Pursuant to the organizational meeting, the Parties submitted a joint hearing protocol which was transmitted to the Tribunal on 21 February 2017.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 April 2017, a letter from Respondent stated that Respondent has decided not to call [REDACTED] for cross-examination, but that this decision should not be deemed an acceptance of his witness statement. Respondent also requested Tribunal\u2019s permission to introduce Sodexo Pass Hungary Ltd.\u2019s (\"SPH\u2019) Hungary Strategic Plan (2010) into the record.\n\n21.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, the Tribunal granted leave for Respondent to submit immediately SPH\u2019s Hungary Strategic Plan (2010) for Tribunal examination, with the caveat that the Tribunal would decide on admissibility and use of that document in witness examination, reserving decision on whether it will accord Claimant an opportunity to make additional written submissions in connection with the 2010 SPH Strategic Plan.\n\n22.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, Respondent submitted the SPH Strategic Plan (2010), tentatively marked Exh. R-0081\n\n23.\n\nA hearing on the Merits took place from 1-4 May 2017 at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C. (the \"Hearing\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n*Tribunal:*\n\nProfessor William W.

Hungary*1 arbitration, discussed *inter alia* at pages 816 and 817 of the Transcript for the Third Day of Evidentiary Hearings (4 May 2017). Accordingly, the Parties were requested to make the text of the award available to the Tribunal. The Parties\u2019 exchanges on *Edenred v. Hungary* award extended over a significant period. Consequently, the Tribunal will address that matter in a separate section below.\n\n*Edenred S.A. v*. *Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/21.\n\n26.\n\nOn 23 June 2017, the Parties notified the Tribunal that they had agreed to simultaneous submission of their respective Post-Hearing Briefs on 12 July 2017. They also proposed to submit their respective statements of costs by 15 September 2017.\n\n27.\n\nOn 2 July 2017, the Tribunal received a message from the Parties, via Claimant, that they do not intend to file updated submissions on costs or further comment on each other\u2019s submissions on costs.\n\n28.\n\nOn 3 July 2017, Claimant's and Respondent's Experts [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] submitted a joint statement of closure costs to the Tribunal. Experts agreed that if Claimant is entitled to Closure costs, the amount of HUF 425,234,451 or \u20ac 1,353,603 is reasonable.\n\n29.\n\nOn 12 July 2017, the Parties simultaneously submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n30.\n\nOn 19 July 2017, Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal confirming that it elected not to submit a separate document of observations, pursuant to Article 16.3.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, on Respondent\u2019s request to introduce the 2010 Strategic Plan. Claimant also objected to Respondent\u2019s belated request, made in its Post-Hearing Brief, to introduce new objections and new evidence. Claimant noted that Respondent raised an objection on ripeness for the first time at the hearing without seeking leave from the Tribunal to do so.\n\n31.\n\nOn 20 July 2017, Respondent replied that it had requested and received leave from the Tribunal to add SPH\u2019s 2010 Strategic Plan to the Record, pursuant to Article 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, and that Claimant had chosen not to comment on the document. Respondent argued that, as it explained during the hearings, it was compelled to raise an objection regarding the *Achmea* case because of its position in the *Edenred v. Hungary* annulment proceedings and because of the relevance of developments in the *Achmea* case to the Tribunal. Respondent also argued that its objection on ripeness was not new, because the issue was initially raised in its Rejoinder. Moreover, Claimant\u2019s case evolved from its initial claim of expropriation in 2012 to expand to cover matters implemented through 2017.\n\n32.\n\nOn 31 July 2017, Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal expressing concern regarding Mr. Andrea Carlevaris\u2019s rejoining his prior firm BonelliErede. As of September 2017, Mr. Carlevaris will be co-leading the international arbitration practice with Mr. Laurence Shore, who is on the counsel team representing Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner and C.D. Holding Internationale (now UP and C.D. Holding Internationale, respectively) in ICSID proceedings against Hungary related to the same measures at issue in Sodexo Pass International s.a.s. (\"SPI\"). Respondent requested Mr. Carlevaris to provide the Tribunal with information regarding safeguards during the interviewing process and going forward in relation to these matters to be certain that Hungary\u2019s rights are protected.\n\n33.\n\nOn 2 August 2017 Mr. Carlevaris replied that he and Mr. Shore were interviewed separately before joining BonelliErede, and had not discussed the SPI case other than a mention of involvement during the interview process. Mr. Carlevaris said that if Mr. Shore planned to be involved in the *Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner v. Hungary*2 case after 1 September, an appropriate disclosure will be made at that time.\n\n*UP (formerly Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner) and C.D Holding Internationale v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/35.\n\n34.\n\nOn 2 August 2017, Respondent informed the Tribunal that no further action regarding the issue of Mr. Carlevaris\u2019s new employment was required at that time.\n\n35.\n\nOn 29 September 2017, Claimant notified the Tribunal that its representatives Philippe Cavalieros and Janet Kim changed law firm from Winston and Strawn to Simmons & Simmons.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledged this change by letter on 6 October 2017.\n\n37.\n\nThe Parties filed their costs submissions 17 October 2017.\n\n38.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 27 November 2018.\n\n**(2) The** ***Edenred v. Hungary*** **Case**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal\u2019s interaction with the Parties in connection with the *Edenred v. Hungary* case, which spanned two months, makes it appropriate to set forth separately the procedural history in that connection.\n\n40.\n\nOn 14 June 2017, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties indicating that its analysis might benefit from seeing the December 2016 award in the *Edenred v. Hungary* arbitration, discussed inter alia at pages 816 and 817 of the Transcript for the Third Day of Evidentiary Hearings (4 May 2017). Accordingly, the Parties were requested to make the text of the award available to the Tribunal.\n\n41.\n\nOn 15 June 2017, Respondent objected to the Tribunal\u2019s request to produce *Edenred v. Hungary*, arguing that consideration of the *Edenred v. Hungary* decision would be prejudicial and unfair to Hungary because the award includes the *Edenred v. Hungary* tribunal\u2019s treatment of legal issues, legal measures, and facts similar to those in the instant case. Respondent also argued that the *Edenred v. Hungary* award contains factual inaccuracies and that both Parties exercised their rights to choose different counsel in the *Edenred v. Hungary* and *SPI v. Hungary* cases. Accordingly, this Tribunal\u2019s review of *Edenred v. Hungary* would frustrate these choices. Finally, if the Tribunal were to require production of the *Edenred v. Hungary* award nonetheless, Respondent requested that it be redacted to omit the recitation of certain facts and confidential financial information belonging to Edenred.\n\n42.\n\nOn 19 June 2017, Claimant objected to Respondent\u2019s proposal to redact the *Edenred v. Hungary* award, noting that the Tribunal presumably requested to see the award precisely because of the similar factual contexts and legal issues involved. Allowing Respondent to redact the award would remove the award\u2019s context and the basis for the ruling, and would potentially allow Respondent to redact the award to its liking. Claimant disputes Respondent\u2019s argument that production would frustrate Respondent\u2019s choice of counsel, since Hungary is represented by the same counsel in all three food voucher cases (*SPI v. Hungary, Edenred v. Hungary,* and *Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner v. Hungary).* Claimant submitted that Procedural Order No. 1, \u00a7 24, was sufficient to address confidentiality concerns, but expressed willingness to submit to a more specific agreement if ordered.\n\n43.\n\nOn 26 June 2017, the Tribunal directed that the *Edenred v. Hungary* award be disclosed to the arbitrators, redacted with respect to Edenred\u2019s confidential information only, but not regarding the facts of the case. The Tribunal directed counsel to confer on the redaction process and submit the award no later than 7 July 2017.\n\n44.\n\nOn 7 July 2017, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal the *Edenred v. Hungary* award issued on 13 December 2016 redacted per the Tribunal\u2019s instructions. According to Respondent\u2019s email, redactions made reflected the agreement of the Parties.\n\n45.\n\nOn 19 July 2017, Claimant noted that Hungary had commented on and cited to the redacted *Edenred v. Hungary* award in its Post-Hearing Brief, allegedly in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s instruction that the award be produced without commentary by either side, a fact to be considered in relation to awarding costs.\n\n46.\n\nOn 20 July 2017, Respondent replied that it had not understood the Tribunal\u2019s email of 15 July 2017 to mean to foreclose it from commenting on the *Edenred v. Hungary* award in its Post-Hearing Brief. Respondent therefore objected to Claimant\u2019s request that these actions should be considered by the Tribunal when awarding costs.\n\n47.\n\nOn 27 July 2017, The Tribunal took note of Claimant\u2019s letter of 19 July and reserved decision on whether it will consider those concerns expressed in it when determining cost allocation. The Tribunal also invited Claimant to submit its own comments on the *Edenred v. Hungary* award within seven days.\n\n48.\n\nOn 7 August 2017, Claimant submitted its comments regarding the *Edenred v. Hungary* award.\n\n49.\n\nOn 11 August 2017, Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal requesting to make brief comments on the *Edenred v. Hungary* award.\n\n50.\n\nOn 14 August 2017, the Tribunal granted Hungary its requested opportunity for limited comment on the *Edenred v. Hungary* award, to be filed by 18 August 2017.\n\n51.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal its comments on the *Edenred v. Hungary* award.\n\n**(3) EC Intervention**\n-----------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn 3 August 2018, the European Commission submitted to the Tribunal an application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party. The Tribunal invited comments by the Parties to be submitted by 14 August 2018.\n\n53.\n\nOn 23 August 2018, after reviewing the Parties\u2019 comments, the Tribunal granted the European Commission leave to submit an amicus brief of no more than 15 pages to be filed within three weeks, with simultaneous comments by the Parties to follow within two weeks after the EC\u2019s filing. Thereafter, the record will be closed, absent express invitation by the Tribunal for any further submissions.\n\n54.\n\nOn 14 September 2018, the EC filed its NDP submission, as directed. The EC filed Annexes EC-9 to EC-12 on 18 September 2018. The Parties submitted their respective comments on 1 October 2018.\n\n**(4) The** ***UP v. Hungary*** **Award**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn 11 October 2018, Claimant requested the Tribunal to order Respondent to produce the final award in the *UP v. Hungary* case (formerly known as *Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner)**.* The final award in *UP v. Hungary* had been released 24 October 2018.\n\n56.\n\nOn 19 October 2018, the Tribunal admitted the *UP (formerly Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner) v. Hungary* award into the record and ordered its production by Respondent. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their comments on the UP (formerly *Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner*) award by 26 October 2018. On 22 October 2018, the Tribunal granted Respondent\u2019s request to extend the deadline to 7 November 2018.\n\n57.\n\nOn 7 November 2018, Respondent produced the *UP v. Hungary* award to the Tribunal. The Parties simultaneously submitted to the Tribunal their respective comments. Respondent noted that \"[a]lthough Hungary would have preferred to produce a redacted version of the Award given the confidential nature of the information contained therein, because the Award in its entirety has now been made public by unauthorized sources, we have here attached an unredacted version.\"\n\n**B. Summary of Parties\u2019 Requests and Tribunal Conclusions**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal (i) declare that Hungary has violated its obligations under the France-Hungary BIT (the \"BIT\") and international law; (ii) order Hungary to pay compensation for the losses incurred by SPI, which it ultimately estimated at \u20ac 78,249,549 plus interest;3 (iii) order Hungary to bear all the costs and expenses of arbitration; (iv) pay interest on amounts awarded; and (v) grant Claimant any other relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.4\n\nFor discussion of the discrepancy between Claimant\u2019s original damages claim and this estimate of \u20ac 78,249,549 plus interest, see Tribunal analysis *infra.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, at para. 87.\n\n59.\n\nRespondent requests that the arbitration be dismissed, with all costs awarded to Hungary.5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, para. 91.\n\n60.\n\nFor reasons discussed below, a majority of the Tribunal (\"the Majority\") has been persuaded that Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in SPH were unlawfully expropriated by Respondent Hungary, with liability pursuant to Article 5(2) of the BIT, and an entitlement to recovery in an amount of \u20ac 72,881,361 with interest as set forth below.\n\n61.\n\nMr. Thomas has submitted a separate and dissenting opinion, concurring with the Majority\u2019s result but setting forth different reasoning. The Majority comments on this separate and dissenting opinion in Part X of this Award.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A.

Declaring that Hungary has violated its obligations under the France-Hungary BIT and international law;\n\n2. Ordering Hungary to pay compensation for the losses incurred by SPI in an amount provisionally estimated at \u20ac 80.4 million;\n\n3. Ordering Hungary to bear all the costs and expenses of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the costs of legal representation;\n\n4. Ordering Hungary to pay interest on any amount awarded to SPI;\n\n5. Granting Claimant any other relief that the Tribunal may deem just and proper.89\n\nCl.

Mem., para. 351.\n\n117.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant updated its request for relief in the following way: the losses claimed were provisionally estimated at \u20ac 78,249,549.91 The Claimant continued to reserve its right to amend or supplement its request for relief during the pendency of the proceeding.92\n\nCl. Reply, para. 334. For discussion of the discrepancy between this and Claimant\u2019s original claim for damages, see Tribunal analysis *infra.*\n\nCl. Reply, para. 334.\n\n118.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to:\n\n1. Dismiss all of Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 5(2) of the BIT;\n\n2. Award Hungary all of the costs and expenses incurred in these proceedings, including attorneys\u2019 fees.93\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 257.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent also reserved its right to amend or supplement its request for relief.94\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 257.\n\n120.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent formulated the same request for relief indicated at paragraph 30 above as well as reserved its right to amend or supplement its request for relief.95\n\nResp. Rej., paras. 266-267.\n\n**IV. JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nFor the reasons below, the Tribunal concludes that it possesses jurisdiction to decide the present dispute.\n\n**A. ICSID Requirements**\n-------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe conditions for ICSID jurisdiction are stated in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and in Articles 1 and 9 of the BIT.\n\n123.\n\nA legal dispute exists in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, understood to mean \"the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation.\"96\n\n*Report of the Executive Directors on the* *Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States* (18 March 1965), para. 26 (CL-0028).\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the present dispute is over SPI's legal rights and Hungary's legal obligations under the BIT and international law, specifically, Hungary's alleged violations of SPI's rights and the amount of damages that Hungary owes to SPI as a result.97\n\nCl. Mem., para. 185.\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent does not address this issue in its Counter-Memorial, but indicates in its Reply that \"the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction have been met in this case.\"98\n\nCl. Reply, para. 146.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its dispute is between a Contracting state and a national of another Contracting state within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n127.\n\nHungary signed the ICSID Convention on 1 October 1986 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 4 February 1987. The ICSID Convention entered into force for Hungary on 6 March 1987. Thus, Hungary is a Contracting state within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n128.\n\nSPI is a juridical person incorporated in France and has always had French nationality, including at the time the Parties consented to submit their dispute to ICSID. SPI is registered at the Commercial Registry of Companies of Nanterre under number 350 925 384.99 France signed the ICSID Convention on 22 December 1965 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 21 August 1967. The ICSID Convention entered into force for France on 20 September 1967. Thus, SPI is a national of another Contracting state for purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 199; SPI Extrait Kbis (Exhibit CEX - 1).\n\n129.\n\nThe BIT's definition of \"investor\" with respect to juridical persons requires that:\n\nAny body corporate constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation and having its registered office there, or controlled, directly or indirectly, by nationals of one Contracting Party, or by bodies corporate having their registered office in the territory of one Contracting Party and constituted in accordance with that Party's legislation\n\n130.\n\nNeither side disputes the existence of an investor, either in pleadings or at the hearing.\n\n131.\n\nWith respect to whether the dispute \"arises directly out of an investment\" (jurisdiction *ratione materiae*), the ICSID Convention does not define investment. However, Article 1(1) of the BIT defines the term as follows:\n\nassets such as goods, rights, and interests of every kind, concerning an economic activity in any sector, made after 31 December 1972, in conformity with the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory or in the maritime area in which the investment is made, and in particular though not exclusively:\n\n(...)\n\nShares and other forms of participation, including minority or indirect holdings, in companies set up in the territory of either Contracting Party;\n\nClaims to debentures, money or to any performance having an economic value;\n\nd) Copyrights, intellectual property rights, industrial property rights (such as patents, licenses, trademarks, industrial models), technical processes, trade names and goodwill (...).100\n\nFrance-Hungary BIT, Article 1(1), Free English translation of the French original, (CL-0001).\n\n132.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, its investment fits all three categories above. First, SPI is the sole shareholder of SPH in accordance with Article 1(1)(b). Second, it has claims and rights to performance having an economic value because of the contracts it concluded with employers and merchants for the issuance of vouchers in accordance with Article 1(1)(c). Third, SPI invested in SPH intellectual and industrial property rights, know-how and technology in accordance with Article 1(1)(d). Pursuant to Article 1(1), SPI made its investments after 31 December 1972 in accordance with Hungarian laws.101\n\nCl. Mem., para. 189.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that its investment is consistent with the typical characteristics of investments, which are non-mandatory, that some ICSID Tribunals have identified, such as contribution, duration, and risk.102\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 191-194.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent did not dispute these contentions in its pleadings or at the hearing.\n\n135.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that there be consent in writing to arbitration from both Parties (jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis).* Such consent can be found in Article 9(2) of the BIT which, as discussed below, provides that disputes related to measures of dispossession shall be resolved by ICSID arbitration.\n\n136.\n\nAccording to Claimant, this Article \"embodies Hungary's standing offer to arbitrate disputes with French investors before ICSID.\"103 Claimant contends that it has met all the requirements of the Article and properly accepted Hungary's offer. Claimant further contends that its dispute relates to measures of dispossession. Attempts were made to negotiate an amicable settlement with Hungary through a letter dated 31 October 2013, sent to the Hungarian Government to notify it of the dispute and accept Hungary's offer to arbitrate.104 Claimant exercised its option to submit the dispute for settlement to ICSID, as the requirement that the state of nationality of the investor and the state Party to the dispute be ICSID Contracting states has been met.105\n\nCl. Mem., para. 200.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 201.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 201.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute these contentions in its pleadings or at the hearing.\n\n**B. Article 9 of the BIT**\n---------------------------\n\n138.\n\nArticle 9(2) of the BIT gives this Tribunal jurisdiction over claims resulting from Article 5(2). Article 9(2) provides, in relevant part:\n\n2. ... [D]isputes concerning dispossession measures as provided for in article 5, paragraph 2, particularly those relating to compensation, its amount, conditions of payment and interest to be paid in the case of delayed payment, shall be settled under the following conditions:\n\n... When each Contracting Party shall have become party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, signed at Washington on 18 March 1965, if any such dispute cannot be amicably settled within six months from the time when a claim is made by one of the parties to the dispute, it shall be submitted for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.106\n\nD\u00e9cret n\u00b0 87-884 du 27 octobre 1987 portant publication de l'accord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique populaire hongroise sur l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements, Paris le 6 novembre 1986 *(Journal officiel* du 31 octobre 1987), p. 123 (RL-0046).\n\n139.\n\nArticle 9(3) of the BIT specifies that \"The arbitral tribunal shall rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\" Accordingly, in reaching its conclusion that BIT Article 9(2) provides jurisdiction over claims resulting from Article 5(2), the Tribunal has considered the ordinary meaning of the relevant BIT provisions. The Tribunal has also considered that the Parties have arguments based on sources such as treaties between other Contracting States with similar texts, and arbitral decisions interpreting questions similar to those presented in this matter.\n\n**C. The CJEU Decision in** ***Achmea*** **and EC Intervention into this Dispute**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Overview**\n----------------\n\n140.\n\nIn relation to its jurisdiction to decide this dispute, the Tribunal must consider the impact of the recent decision of the European Court of Justice107 in *Slovak Republic v. Achmea,* hereinafter referred to as *Achmea*.108\n\nThe Tribunal has noted a variance in citation to *Achmea,* sometimes with reference to ECJ (European Court of Justice), sometimes CJEU (Court of Justice of European Union). Our understanding is that the CJEU is a judicial institution seated in Luxembourg comprised of two different courts, the Court of Justice (with one judge from each EU country) which addresses *inter alia* requests for rulings from national courts, and the General Court, which rules on actions for annulment brought by individuals and companies.\n\n*Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V.,* European Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) (Court of Justice of the European Union), 6 March 2018.\n\n141.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal has considered the Parties' submissions on the matter, including letters from Respondent on 27 March 2018 and from Claimant on 16 April 2018.\n\n142.\n\nIn passing, the Tribunal notes that even before the *Achmea* decision had been rendered, the Parties' had exchanged views on the matter, following Respondent's letter of 14 April 2017 notifying the Tribunal that the impact of the TFEU had been referred to the CJEU. The import of that reference was also discussed in oral exchanges between counsel and the Tribunal in Washington, as recorded in the Transcript for Day 1 of the hearings for 5 May 2017.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet filed with the CJEU on 19 September 2017, addressing the effect of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as it may affect this arbitration.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the European Commission\u2019s (EC\u2019s) *Amicus Curiae* brief in this matter, dated 14 September 2018, and the Parties\u2019 responses, including letters from Claimant and Respondent on 28 September 2018.\n\n**(2) The** ***Achmea*** **Decision**\n-------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn *Achmea,* the underlying dispute arose from an investment in Slovakia by a Dutch insurance group. The Dutch claimant had challenged the reversal of certain measures to liberalize the health insurance market in the Slovak Republic. The challenge was brought pursuant to Article 8 of the 1992 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia (as it then was).\n\n146.\n\nAs permitted under the relevant BIT, the Dutch claimant, *Achmea,* opted for arbitration pursuant to the UNCITRAL Rules, before an arbitral tribunal seated in Frankfurt. An award of \u20ac 22 million in favor of *Achmea* was challenged in an unsuccessful annulment action before a court in Frankfurt, with appeal to the German BGH (Bundesgerichtshof).\n\n147.\n\nThe host state, Slovakia, contended that the arbitration provisions of the BIT were incompatible with certain provisions of the TFEU.\n\n148.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal did not purport to apply European Union Law. Nevertheless, the BGH made a reference to the CJEU for an opinion on whether the BIT was incompatible with EU law.\n\n149.\n\nIn its decision, the CJEU addressed the effect of two provisions in the TFEU: (i) Article 344, which provides that EU member states \"undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein,\" and (ii) Article 267, providing *inter alia* that the CJEU \"shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning: (a) the interpretation of the Treaties; (b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.\"109\n\nIn light of its rulings on Articles 267 and 344, the ECJ found it unnecessary to answer a third question referred by the German BGH, related to Article 18 of the TFEU, which provides \"Within the scope of application of the Treaties, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.\"\n\n150.\n\nThe CJEU rendered a ruling whose conclusion reads as follows in the English text110:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\nIn light of its views on Articles 267 and 344, the CJEU did not consider it necessary to reach the discrimination provisions of Article 18 of the TFEU.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the French text of that decision reads with greater flexibility and nuance. The English employs the verb \"to preclude\" which might imply that the TFEU imposes some supervening illegality that renders investor-state arbitration *per se* invalid. The French text reads, \"Les articles 267 et 344 TFUE doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s en ce sens qu'ils s'opposent \u00e0 une disposition [aux termes de laquelle un investisseur peut] introduire une proc\u00e9dure ...devant un tribunal arbitral.\" In using the verb *s'opposer* the French text carries a notion of tension as between the TFEU and BIT arbitration, rather than some supervening illegality.\n\n**(3) The Parties\u2019 Positions on** ***Achmea***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nRespondent argues that the *Achmea* Decision has a general reach and applies to the France-Hungary BIT, and to these proceedings.\n\n153.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the CJEU established the incompatibility of Articles 267 and 344 TFEU with any international agreement concluded between Member States under which an investor from one Member State may bring proceedings against another Member State before an arbitral tribunal concerning an investment in the latter Member State.\n\n154.\n\nRespondent does not consider the CJEU finding confined to the specific treaty considered in that case. Respondent also contended, inter alia, that the CJEU reasoning remains persuasive and applicable to an ICSID case, with effect *erga omnes* to deprive the current Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n155.\n\nIn the alternative, should the Tribunal take the view that it possesses jurisdiction, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should decline to issue a ruling on the merits on this case.\n\n156.\n\nIn this context, Respondent cites Judge Rosalyn Higgins in the Legality of the Use of Force case *(Serbia and Montenegro v. Germany).*111 That Opinion speaks of the right of a court not to exercise a jurisdiction it has.\n\n*Serbia and Montenegro v. Germany,* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports (2004), Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, at paras 10-11.\n\n157.\n\nRespondent contends that a compelling reason not to exercise jurisdiction includes the prevention of fragmentation of international law resulting from \"the proliferation of international *fora* and/or the issuance of conflicting decisions and unenforceable awards.\"\n\n158.\n\nIn contrast, Claimant argues *inter alia* that the Tribunal's jurisdiction derives *not* from EU law, but from Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the France-Hungary BIT. According to Claimant, Respondent is estopped from arguing differently.\n\n159.\n\nClaimant further contends that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is not impacted by the *Achmea* Decision because the CJEU simply referred to a provision of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT which required application of Slovakian law. In that respect, the CJEU found that the arbitrators in that case may have to interpret and apply EU law as a part of Slovakian law.\n\n160.\n\nMore specifically, argues Claimant, the CJEU reasoning rested on Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, which was found to be precluded by Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, establishing a preliminary ruling procedure on interpretation and application of EU law. That finding does not bar this present tribunal from exercising jurisdiction, as it is not asked to decide whether Hungary\u2019s conduct breached EU law in any way.\n\n**(4) European Commission Intervention**\n----------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) submitted an *Amicus Curiae* Brief to the Tribunal dated 14 September 2018.\n\n162.\n\nThe EC argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute in light of the *Achmea* decision. In brief, the EC argued that the *Achmea* judgment applies to the French-Hungarian BIT. European Union (EU) law, in its view, thus prevails over Article 9(2) of the French-Hungarian BIT because of the general principle of the primacy of European Union (EU) law in the event of a conflict of laws.112 Article 9(2) of the BIT contains the offer to arbitrate in the case of dispute, referenced above in Section IV.B. of this Award. The EC argues that Article 9(2) became invalid when Hungary joined the EU in 2004.\n\nEC *Amicus Curie* Brief, paras. 20-26.\n\n163.\n\nFurthermore, the EC argues, the conflict rules in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), particularly the principle of posteriority in Article 30(3) of the VCLT, support the primacy of EU law over Article 9(2) of the BIT.113\n\n*Id.* at paras. 28-39.\n\n164.\n\nArticle 30(3) of the VCLT provides that when all parties to an earlier treaty are also parties to a later treaty, but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended under Article 59 of the VCLT, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\n\n165.\n\nThus, in the EC\u2019s view, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute because Hungary has not consented in a valid manner to the arbitration. Hungary\u2019s consent to arbitration became invalid when Hungary joined the EU.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the EC's *Amicus* Brief also makes reference to Article 14 of the BIT. However, the BIT contains no Article 14.\n\n167.\n\nFinally, the EC argues that *Achmea'*s reasoning that intra-EU investment arbitration is incompatible with EU law is applicable to ICSID arbitrations, even though *Achmea* itself concerned an UNCITRAL arbitration.114 UNCITRAL disputes only partially remove such control by a Member State's judge. The EC argues that the ICSID system precludes review of an award by a national judge of a Member State, thus forestalling any possibility that a judge of a Member State's court could control the substance of an ICSID Award. Thus, *Achmea'*s reasoning logically applies to invalidate ICSID arbitrations, which exclude Member States' courts to a greater degree than UNCITRAL proceedings.\n\n*Id.* at paras. 13-19.\n\n168.\n\nThe EC also argues that the \"sunset clause\" in Article 12 of the BIT is also invalid because it seeks to prolong the applicability of the offer for arbitration in Article 9(2).115\n\n*Id.* at para. 17.\n\n169.\n\nThe EC further argues that any award in this dispute would be unenforceable since the award would be based on an invalid consent to arbitration, and therefore domestic tribunals of Member States would be required to refuse recognition and enforcement.116\n\n*Id*. at para. 43.\n\n170.\n\nIn its letter of 28 September 2018, Respondent substantially echoes the EC's argument that EU law prevails over Articles 9(2), 9(3), and 12 of the BIT, and that application of the VCLT further supports *Achmea'*s reasoning in this regard.117 Respondent notes that it has consistently argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in this dispute for this reason.118 Respondent argues that the Tribunal should decline issuing a decision on the merits in the instant dispute for these reasons, and to prevent the fragmentation of international law.119\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of 28 September 2018.\n\n*Id*., at p. 1.\n\n*Id*. at p. 9.\n\n171.\n\nIn its comments of 28 September 2018, Claimant argues that EU law is irrelevant to the Tribunal's determination of jurisdiction, which stems from the ICSID Convention and the BIT. The *Achmea* decision, in Claimant's view, is restricted to provisions like those under the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT at issue in *Achmea,* and therefore does not apply to the France-Hungary BIT.120\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter of 28 September 2018, paras. 3-5.\n\n172.\n\nClaimant further argues that *Achmea* has no automatic legal effect, as evidenced by the fact that the Commission itself has asked certain Member States\u2014but not Hungary\u2014to terminate their intra-EU BITs.121 Other tribunals have been debating the applicability of *Achmea* to other intra-EU BITs, revealing that its applicability is far from automatic.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter of 28 September 2018, paras. 7-10.\n\n173.\n\nFurther, Claimant argues that EU law does not apply to the merits of this arbitration. Claimant cites Respondent's argument that the CJEU's C-179/14 judgment against Hungary is irrelevant in this dispute because CJEU and ICSID Proceedings are fundamentally different.122 In this context, and given exchanges on the matter implicating Parties, Claimant argues that the Parties have agreed to exclude EU law from the ambit of law applicable to this dispute.123\n\n*Id.* at para. 26.\n\n*Id.* at para. 28.\n\n174.\n\nClaimant further argues that, by extending *Achmea'*s reasoning to ICSID arbitrations, the EC ignores the premise that arbitration is generally immune from Court review.124 Moreover, *Achmea'*s primary concern was with cases where a tribunal is asked to interpret or apply EU law. As this Tribunal is not required to interpret or apply EU or Hungarian law, and no danger exists that the Tribunal may render an award that threatens the consistent and uniform application of EU law, *Achmea* is inapplicable here.125\n\n*Id.* at para. 30.\n\n*Id*. at para. 31.\n\n175.\n\nMoreover, Claimant argues that the EC\u2019s conflicts analysis is flawed. The TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT do not share the same subject matter, as required for application of the VCLT\u2019s provisions 59 and 30 on conflicts.126 Therefore, Claimant argues, neither the EU\u2019s conflict rules nor the VCLT apply in this arbitration.\n\n*Id*. at para. 38-42.\n\n176.\n\nMoreover, Claimant argues that the EC did not identify any rule providing for the primacy of EU law over an international treaty.127\n\n*Id*. at paras. 52-56.\n\n177.\n\nClaimant argues that no risk of the fragmentation of international law exists in this case because no forum with competing jurisdiction to this Tribunal may render a conflicting decision.128 The France-Hungary BIT and the EU dispute mechanisms operate in their own spheres without conflict, according to Claimant.129\n\n*Id*. at para. 46.\n\n*Id*. at para. 50.\n\n**(5) Tribunal Analysis**\n-------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe EC\u2019s intervention in this case stems from its interpretation of the *Achmea* judgment. The Tribunal thus addresses *Achmea* here.\n\n179.\n\nAs noted above, the *Achmea* decision involved a reference to the CJEU in respect of intra-European Union bilateral investment treaties, as related to the compatibility of those treaties with Articles 18, 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\"), although in the end the CJEU rested its decision only on Articles 267 and 344.\n\n180.\n\nIn relevant part, those provisions provide as follows.\n\n(a) The first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU states that \"within the scope of application of the Treaties, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.\"\n\n(b)The first to third paragraphs of Article 267 TFEU provide:\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:\n\n(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;\n\n(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.\n\nWhere such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.\n\nWhere any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.\n\n(c) Article 344 TFEU provides that \"Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.\"\n\n181.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that this present dispute does not involve the application of the law of any EU state, or the law of the EU as such.\n\n182.\n\nArticle 9(3) of the relevant France-Hungary BIT specifies that \"The arbitral tribunal shall rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\" This provision remains highly significant, particularly in light of other treaties with contrasting applicable law provisions. Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, relevant in *Achmea,* provides that the arbitral tribunal shall take into account *inter alia* \"the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned\" which of course would be the law of an EU member state.\n\n183.\n\nIn addressing \"international law\" the Tribunal considered the ordinary meaning of the treaty provisions and other applicable interpretative sources as permitted by Articles 31 and 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, with recourse to supplementary means of interpretation only when the ordinary meaning would otherwise be ambiguous or obscure, or would lead to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n184.\n\nThus, the Tribunal would not apply either Hungarian or EU law.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that by its terms the CJEU ruling appears to bind not this Arbitral Tribunal, but rather the EU state court in Germany that referred the matter to the CJEU for a ruling. Although scholarly opinion may be divided on the *erga omnes* effects within the EU of a CJEU judgment, at most those effects would concern EU member state courts, not an ICSID tribunal whose authority rests on an international treaty such as the ICSID Convention.\n\n186.\n\nUnlike the arbitral tribunal in *Achmea,* this Tribunal's authority derives from the self-contained system of the ICSID Convention. This Tribunal's decisions do not risk annulment proceedings in any of the EU member states, at least not pursuant to grounds traditionally considered legitimate under national law.\n\n187.\n\nBy contrast, *Achmea* concerned an *ad hoc* arbitration tribunal subject to the law of Germany, an EU member.\n\n188.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal must decide on Hungary's alleged liability on the basis of the BIT itself and international law, not EU law or the law of an EU state. No allegation has been made that EU law has been violated or that the controverted measures in question run contrary to EU law. Indeed, neither side in the present case has argued for the application of either Hungarian or EU law to the underlying dispute.\n\n189.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal sees no reason to find an impairment of its jurisdiction by reason of the *Achmea* decision. The CJEU in *Achmea* ruled with respect to a treaty that required application of Slovakian law, as to which the tribunal in that case might need to interpret EU legal principles. In that context, Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT was precluded by Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU which establish a preliminary ruling procedure\" by which parties undertake not to submit disputes about the interpretation and application of EU law to methods of dispute settlements outside of the EU Treaties.\n\n190.\n\nIn the present arbitration, no such reasoning bars the arbitral tribunal from exercising jurisdiction. No risk exists of substantive legal fragmentation with respect to international tribunals or courts of competing jurisdiction.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal in this present case is not asked to decide whether Hungary\u2019s conduct breached EU law. The CJEU infringement procedure against Hungary, referred to above, has been discussed as a factual circumstance, not in support of applicability of EU law to the present dispute. Moreover, proceedings before the CJEU and ICSID tribunals are fundamentally different. Principles of comity and judicial propriety do not require any tribunal to decline jurisdiction in favor of another.\n\n192.\n\nNo conflict exists between the TFEU and the BIT that would negate the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. The TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT do not share the same subject matter, as required for application of the VCLT\u2019s provisions 59 and 30 on conflicts. Thus, neither the TFEU\u2019s nor the VCLT\u2019s provisions on conflict of laws apply in this arbitration.\n\n193.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, after having carefully considered the ECJ decision in *Achmea,* the EC Intervention, and Claimant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s related submissions, the Tribunal concludes that the decision has no preclusive effect such as to remove its jurisdiction over the present dispute.\n\n**D. Treaty Interpretation**\n----------------------------\n\n194.\n\nArticle 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\"), permits recourse to supplementary means of interpretation such as these, but only to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 [of the Convention], or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n195.\n\nArticle 31(1) requires that a treaty ... be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n196.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal has considered the Parties' arguments based on multiple decisions of national or international tribunals, not as binding precedent, but for the purpose of promoting consistent interpretation of comparable treaty language and similar fact patterns. The Tribunal has taken special note of prior decisions or awards that were cited by the Parties in their submissions.\n\n197.\n\nIn relation to the BIT, the Tribunal has considered several key matters, including the object of the expropriation, the occurrence of the expropriation, the distinction between an expropriation and a *bona fide* regulatory measure, and the lawfulness of the expropriation.\n\n**V. OBJECT OF EXPROPRIATION**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Nature of Investment**\n---------------------------\n\n**(1) The Treaty Terms**\n------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe definition of \"investment\" in the France-Hungary BIT provides as follows:130\n\nArticle 1. Pour l'application du pr\u00e9sent Accord:\n\n1. Le terme : \u00ab investissement \u00bb d\u00e9signe des actifs tels que les biens, droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats de toutes natures, lies \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique dans quelque secteur que ce soit ... et plus particuli\u00e8rement, mais non exclusivement:\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\**\n\nb) Les actions et autres formes de participation m\u00eame minoritaires ou indirectes, aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s constitu\u00e9es sur le territoire de l'une des Parties;\n\nThe English translation taken from the UN Treaty Series reads as follows:\n\nArticle 1. For the purposes of this Agreement:\n\nThe term \"investment\" shall apply to assets such as property, rights, and any type of interests of any category, related to an economic activity in any sector whatever, established after 31 December 1972, in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory or maritime zones the investment was made, and particularly but not exclusively, to:\n\nb) Shares and other forms of participation, albeit minority or indirect, in companies constituted in the territory of either Party;131\n\nD\u00e9cret n\u00b0 87-884 du 27 octobre 1987 portant publication de l'accord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique populaire hongroise sur l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements, Paris le 6 novembre 1986 *(Journal officiel* du 31 octobre 1987) (CLA-0001).\n\nRL-0046. The Tribunal notes that Claimant appears to have used a slightly different translation. CL-0001, cited in Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at para. 187.), reads to cover \"... assets such as goods, rights, and interests of every kind, concerning an economic activity in any sector, made after 31 December 1972, in conformity with the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory or in the maritime area in which the investment is made, and in particular though not exclusively: (...) b) Shares and other forms of participation, including minority or indirect holdings, in companies set up in the territory of either Contracting Party;\" This translation does not have variations that are significant for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis. The Tribunal notes that Claimant does not seem to have submitted any translation into English as CL-0001, but instead submitted the French version of the BIT as document CLA-0001.\n\n**(2) Summary of Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nAccording to Claimant, SPI's shareholding in SPH constitutes the object of the expropriation,132 Hungary's tax measures destroyed SPH's ability to generate profit and thereby stripped the shareholdings of value, tantamount to seizure of those shareholdings, indirectly transferring much of the value of those shareholdings to the state.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 2.\n\n200.\n\nClaimant further contends that goodwill, know-how, customers, market access, and market share are part of SPI's investment, contribute to the value of covered shareholdings, and are recognized as property rights related to the underlying investment that are capable of being expropriated.133\n\nCl. PHB, para. 3.\n\n201.\n\nSPH was still in operation at the time the case was filed, with Claimant retaining control of its shares. Claimant contends, however, that control of the shares is irrelevant to the fact of its dispossession. Claimant further asserts that the BIT does not impose any durational requirement on a dispossession. Dispossession must be more than temporary or ephemeral, but need not continue indefinitely.134\n\nCl. PHB, para. 10.\n\n202.\n\nRespondent admits that Claimant\u2019s shareholding constitutes a right capable of expropriation, but argues that there has not been a taking of the shares nor of any rights associated with those shares.135 Respondent notes that Claimant still has title, ownership, and control of the shareholdings, and possession of assets; and that SPH is still in operation.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 18.\n\n203.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant complains only about a reduction in the value of SPI\u2019s shares in SPH.136 Since the Claimant had no right to market share, market position, customers, or the preferential tax regime it previously enjoyed, Respondent argues that Claimant has no legal rights capable of expropriation.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 19.\n\n204.\n\nRespondent further asserts that, to establish an expropriation claim, Claimant must show that its deprivation is permanent.137 According to Respondent, the BIT\u2019s very choice of the term \"dispossession\" was meant to narrow the scope of expropriation that is actionable under the BIT. For Respondent, the BIT requires the impact of dispossession to be irreversible, persistent, or irreparable.138 The clause\u2019s purpose, says Respondent, was to assimilate protections for indirect expropriations to those for direct expropriations, with a need for permanence in dispossession.139\n\nResp. PHB, para. 43.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 44.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 44, citing see, *e.g., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and* *Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability (30 July 2010), para.134 (holding that dispossession requires substantial deprivation of the investment, which must be permanent with lasting results) (RL-0041); see also *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Liability (27 December 2010), para. 196 (holding that dispossession requires total deprivation of the investment\u2019s value or total loss of control by the investor of its investment, both of a permanent nature) (RL-0045); see also *Les Laboratoires Serviers, S.A.S., Biofarma, S.A.S., Arts et Techniques du Progres S.A.S. v. Republic of Poland,* UNCITRAL, Award (14 February 2012), para. 577 (although dispossession must not be permanent in the sense of continuing ad infinitum, the deprivation must possess a more than transitory character) (CL-0055).\n\n**B. Property Interest Capable of Being Dispossessed or Expropriated**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal has been persuaded that Claimant possessed a property interest constituted by its shareholdings, and that this property interest existed independently of the favorable tax regime. The value of those shareholdings was taken by state action and transferred to state-controlled entities.\n\n206.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Majority notes that the Parties sometimes seem to use the terms \"dispossession\" and \"expropriation\" interchangeably. The separate and dissenting opinion of Mr. Thomas distinguishes between the two notions. By contrast, while not denying that in some instances differences may exist, the Majority does not rest its decision on any operative distinction between the two words, as relevant to findings on liability or damages.\n\n207.\n\nRegardless of the reason for Claimant's investment (whether tax motivated or not), the investment once made became capable of expropriation.\n\n208.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal considers the existence of the SPH shares as sufficient for an expropriation claim. No additional vested property right is required. For the Majority, the taking of shares suffices to trigger an expropriation claim.\n\n209.\n\nNo vested property or contractual rights, in addition to shares, would normally be required to constitute an expropriation. In his connection, the Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States 1987, Sect. 712, states at comment g: \"A state is responsible as for an expropriation of property under subsection (1) when it subjects alien property to taxation, regulation or other action [...] that prevents, unreasonably interferes with, or unduly delays, effective enjoyment of an alien's property\".\n\n210.\n\nIn passing, it may be noted that besides *Edenred v. Hungary,* and *UP v. Hungary,* no other arbitral tribunal has had occasion to examine the exact legal issues in the instant arbitration.\n\n211.\n\nThe Majority considers that the facts in the present dispute are distinguishable from cases relied on by Respondent suggesting that a vested property right, independent of shares, must exist to create an expropriation claim. None of the precedents relied upon by Respondent requires the existence of vested property interests in addition to shareholding rights of the expropriated enterprise.\n\n212.\n\nIn cases which rejected claims of indirect expropriation, the non-existence of contractual or other vested rights (besides shareholdings) was not the decisive argument.140\n\nSee, *e.g.,* decisions in *Feldman v. Mexico, Encana v. Ecuador,* and *Emmis v. Hungary,* cited infra.\n\n213.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal considers as particularly misplaced Respondent's reference to *Emmis v. Hungary,*141 on which the separate and dissenting opinion also relies. Respondent has cited the case for the proposition that the claimant must have a vested property right or asset in order to justify a claim of indirect expropriation.142 *Emmis v. Hungary* concerned a national FM-radio frequency broadcasting license which allegedly constituted rights under Hungarian property law created by a broadcasting agreement. In *Emmis v. Hungary,* the action was brought to protect contract rights, not to seek compensation for shareholding interests as such. By contrast, the present arbitration implicates claims related to the taking of shares.\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V. (Dutch), Emmis Radio Operating, B.V. (Dutch), MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. V. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. 12/2.\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award (16 April 2014) (RL-0012).\n\n214.\n\nThe contractual rights at stake in *Emmis v. Hungary* did not exist at the time relevant to the claim.143 At the time in question, all that the claimants had was an invitation to tender for a possible renewal of the license.144 The measures taken by the state affected rights that had already expired. Even if the value of the property was greatly diminished, the acts of the state could not cause such effect as they did not affect rights that were in force at the time the measures were taken.\n\nUltimately, the expropriation claim in *Emmis* failed because the contractual rights did not exist at the time relevant to the claim. Id., at paras. 213, 221.\n\nId., at paras. 213, 221.\n\n215.\n\nUnlike in *Emmis v. Hungary,* in the instant arbitration, SPI owned shareholdings in SPH at the time of the PIT reforms and the alleged expropriation. The facts of *Emmis v. Hungary* are thus sufficiently distinct from the instant case that it is not applicable here.\n\n216.\n\nRespondent\u2019s reliance on *Merrill Ring v. Canada*145 is also misplaced. *Merrill Ring v. Canada* actually supports Claimant\u2019s position by confirming that covered investments are capable of being expropriated, and that the loss of value of covered investments can result in an expropriation. In *Merrill Ring v. Canada*, the tribunal dismissed the expropriation claim, as it disagreed with claimant\u2019s allegation that its \"interest in realizing fair market value for its logs on the international market\" was protected under NAFTA as a standalone right. While the tribunal held that claimant did not have a right to export at a certain price, it expressly noted that claimant\u2019s right to access the international market is a property interest subject to NAFTA protection.146 The tribunal went on to reason that, had claimant\u2019s business been operating at a loss as a result of the measures, an expropriation could have been found because its value would have been \"seriously compromised.\"147 In the present case, the value of Claimant\u2019s shareholdings was reduced nearly to zero by the challenged measures. It could no longer access the voucher market in which it was a dominant player until the challenged reforms. Thus, *Merrill Ring v. Canada* is distinguishable from the instant case in its finding that an expropriation did not occur, but its reasoning actually supports Claimant\u2019s position.\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Canada,* UNCITRAL, ICSID Administered Case, Award (31 March 2010), paras. 140 and 144 (RL-0023).\n\n*Id*. at para. 143.\n\n*Id*. at para. 148.\n\n217.\n\n*Feldman v. Mexico*148 is also distinguishable from the present case. In *Feldman v. Mexico,* claimant was a registered export company that alleged that its Mexican subsidiary had a right to export cigarettes. It argued that its investment was appropriated when respondent refused to rebate excise taxes applied to cigarette exports. The tribunal rejected the expropriation claim for three main reasons: 1) international law does not require states to permit \"grey market\" exports of cigarettes; 2) claimant's investment was not completely destroyed, and claimant was able to continue several other lines of business in Mexico, and 3) the State's measures were based on objective, justifiable reasons, and the most unfavorable conditions of them had been in force for the entire duration of the investment and were not new.\n\n*Marvin Feldman v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award (16 December 2002), paras. 1, 119 (RL-0015).\n\n218.\n\nUnlike in *Feldman v. Mexico,* the object of Hungary's expropriation is not an abstract right. The object of the expropriation was Claimant's shareholdings, which do not require an additional vested right to ground an expropriation claim. Moreover, the challenged measures were not *bona fide*, as discussed below. Also, in *Feldman v. Mexico*, the claimant's argument was based on an alleged change in the tax law, which had actually been unchanged for the entire duration of the investment. The meal voucher industry at issue in the instant case is not comparable to \"grey market activity\" like the cigarette export industry.149 Thus, *Feldman v. Mexico* is distinguishable from the instant case.\n\n*See Commission v. Hungary,* C-179/14, Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber) (23 February 2016), para. 168 (CL-0127) (rejecting Hungary\u2019s reliance on EU cases involving gray market activities because meal voucher policy objectives were not comparable to such cases).\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal does not understand Claimant to assert a vested right to the continuation of a preferential tax framework in itself. It is undisputed that Claimant had no vested right to the continuance of the legal regime it had enjoyed for many years. However, the change, in combination with other measures taken by the state and discussed below, had the effect of destroying the value of the Claimant's shares in SPI Hungary\u2014in which it did have a vested right\u2014and of transferring the Claimant's market share to entities in which the state had a financial interest.\n\n220.\n\nRespondent has noted that Claimant's argument about the nature of its investment in Hungary has changed over the course of the proceedings. This may be so.\n\n221.\n\nAt this point, however, the Tribunal must address whether there exists an object capable of expropriation, given the arguments that have ultimately been made by both sides.\n\n**C. Tribunal Analysis and Conclusion**\n---------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal finds that Claimant SPI made an investment in Hungary through its shareholdings, which were the object of the expropriation. Thus, at the time of the alleged expropriation, Claimant owned an investment protected under the BIT.\n\n223.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that Article 1(b) of the BIT defines \"investment\" to include, \"particularly but not exclusively,\" shares and any other forms of participation: \"les actions et autres formes de participation\" in the French original.\n\n224.\n\nIt is undisputed that SPI, at the time of the alleged expropriation, owned 100% of the shares in SPH, the relevant Hungarian entity, which constituted an investment under the BIT.\n\n225.\n\nThe above-mentioned definition of investment contained in the BIT determines the scope of protection and applies both to whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on a claim of expropriation and to the substantive protection under the BIT, i.e., whether the rights covered by the definition are capable of expropriation. If shareholding rights are sufficient for the purpose of establishing the existence of an investment and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the same rights are also sufficient for the purpose of establishing a breach of the substantive standards of protection, including expropriation.\n\n226.\n\nShareholding rights can be the object of direct expropriation, as would be the case in the event of direct transfer of title over the shares, or of indirect expropriation, as in the event of loss of value that effectively neutralizes the investment. If shares are property that can be directly expropriated, it follows that they can also be indirectly expropriated.\n\n227.\n\nSuppose the Tribunal found that Claimant's shareholdings were not a property right or investment capable of expropriation. The logical consequence of this would be that the BIT does not protect shareholdings from expropriation. This would discourage investors from investing via shareholdings in a state, which would undermine the purpose of the France-Hungary BIT and similar BITs.\n\n228.\n\nThus, the Majority of the Tribunal concludes that Claimant's shareholdings were the object of the expropriation in the instant case.\n\n**VI. OCCURRENCE OF EXPROPRIATION**\n-----------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine whether an expropriation occurred.\n\n230.\n\nIn their post-hearing briefs, the Parties agreed that Claimant did not make any claim for a direct expropriation.150 The Tribunal must, therefore, define \"indirect expropriation\" in order to determine whether one occurred. The BIT provides no such definition.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 9; Resp. PHB, para. 42.\n\n**A. Indirect Expropriation**\n-----------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Tribunal will apply the definition of indirect expropriation that it proposed to the Parties, and to which they agreed in their post-hearing briefs:151\n\nA measure or series of measures that has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation in that it substantially deprives the investor of the fundamental attributes of property in its investment, including the right to use, enjoy, and dispose of its investment, without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 12; Resp. PHB, para. 48.\n\n232.\n\nAt times, Claimant\u2019s submissions suggest that Respondent committed a \"creeping expropriation\" or an \"indirect creeping expropriation.\"152\n\n*See, e.g.,* Cl. PHB, para. 4 (\"creeping expropriation\"); Cl. PHB, p. 20 (\"A. Hungary\u2019s [*sic*] Mischaracterizes SPI\u2019s Claim of Indirect Creeping Expropriation\").\n\n233.\n\nClaimant and Respondent do not differ substantially on the meaning of those expressions, having agreed to the above-cited definition of \"indirect expropriation\" in their post-hearing briefs. Both sides thus seem to agree that creeping expropriation represents a type of indirect expropriation that occurs through a series of cumulative actions rather than a single measure.153 Claimant\u2019s definition of indirect expropriation includes dispossession through a series of actions, \"none of which might qualify as an expropriation by itself, but the aggregate effect of which is to destroy the value of the investment.\"154\n\nCl. PHB, para. 11, citing C.H. Schreuer, *The Concept of Expropriation under the ETC and other Investment Protection Treaties,* transnational Dispute Management (Nov. 2005), Vol. 2 Issue 5, paras. 35-36 (CL-0053); Resp. PHB, para. 45.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 11, citing Schreuer.\n\n**(1) Series of Measures Leading to Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal accepts Claimant\u2019s argument that the PIT changes, tax advantages to the SZ\u00c9P Cards through PIT and SZ\u00c9P Decree, and tax advantages to the Erzs\u00e9bet Vouchers through the PIT, Erzs\u00e9bet Decree, and Erzs\u00e9bet Act constituted a series of acts leading to an indirect expropriation.155\n\nCl. PHB, para. 14.\n\n235.\n\nClaimant further argues that these measures were part of an even greater set of actions, including due process violations, implementation of a media campaign from state funds, reneged representations by Hungarian negotiators, and continuing tax reforms in 2013. Claimant argues that all of these actions had abusive intent, no proven public purpose, and collectively led to the destruction of its investment.156 As discussed below, the Majority of the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that some of these actions contributed to the indirect expropriation.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 14.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent argues that changes in the vouchers\u2019 tax advantage cannot give rise to liability under the BIT when the changes were justifiable. Respondent argues that the tax changes were justifiable to promote a public purpose.157 The Tribunal will discuss Respondent\u2019s public purpose argument below.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 61.\n\n**(2) Substantial Deprivation**\n-------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nOn balance, the majority of the Tribunal finds that changes to the tax regime substantially deprived Claimant of the fundamental attributes of property in its investment, including the right to use and enjoy its investment. The PIT changes decreased the value of Claimant\u2019s investment to nearly zero and resulted in the previous value of Claimant\u2019s investment being transferred indirectly to the state. In this respect, the present case can be distinguished from *El Paso v. Argentina.*158\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award (31 October 2011) (RL-0011).\n\n238.\n\nRespondent cited *El Paso v. Argentina* to support its assertion that an indirect expropriation did not occur because Claimant remains in control of its investment. However*, El Paso v. Argentina* is distinct from the current arbitration.\n\n239.\n\nIn *El Paso v. Argentina,* claimant sold its investment in Argentinian companies, claiming that Argentina\u2019s measures during a financial crisis had destroyed the value of its investment and caused its lack of business prospects. Argentina argued that claimant El Paso sold its investment to concentrate on business elsewhere, not because of Argentina\u2019s financial measures.\n\n240.\n\nFirst, *El Paso v. Argentina* confirms that the investor\u2019s shareholding rights can be the obj ect of indirect expropriation regardless of the existence of ownership or contractual rights of the locally incorporated subsidiary. The tribunal declined jurisdiction over claims based on alleged breaches of the rights of the locally incorporated subsidiaries, which did not qualify as protected investments. It also noted that El Paso had not entered into any investment agreement with the state.159\n\nId., at paras. 198 and 267.\n\n241.\n\nThe tribunal then analyzed El Paso\u2019s indirect expropriation claim with reference to El Paso\u2019s shares in the locally incorporated subsidiaries. El Paso\u2019s expropriation claim failed because the tribunal found that the claimant\u2019s sale of its shares in the subsidiaries was part of a global worldwide divestment strategy, and not a direct and unavoidable consequence of the measures taken by Argentina.160 The tribunal rejected the claim on its merits, but did not question that shares can be the object of indirect expropriation to the extent the state's conduct results in the neutralization of the property rights of the investor.161\n\nId., at paras. 277-299.\n\nId., at paras. 299.\n\n242.\n\nThe *El Paso v. Argentina* tribunal concluded that Argentina's tax measures did not constitute an indirect expropriation because they were reasonable and that their impact on the claimant had not been so severe as to \"result in the neutralization of the property rights of the Claimant.\"162\n\nId., at para. 299.\n\n243.\n\nWhile *El Paso v. Argentina* bears similarities to the instant case because it involved an alleged indirect expropriation of Claimant's shareholdings, the facts of *El Paso v. Argentina* are distinct from those in *SPI v. Hungary.* Unlike in *El Paso v. Argentina,* where significant evidence existed that Claimant intended to sell its shares as part of a broader business strategy, a direct and unavoidable causal link exists between the PIT reforms and the loss of the value of Claimant's investment, and also Claimant's exclusion from the Hungarian voucher market\n\n244.\n\nIn *El Paso v. Argentina*, the tribunal found that the measures adopted by Argentina did not result in the neutralization of the investor's property rights. In the present case, the impact of the PIT reforms on SPI's investment is far more severe than in *El Paso v. Argentina.* Claimant was deprived not only of the value of its investment, but had its market share transferred to entities selected or controlled by the state, and was deprived of the ability to compete in the Hungarian voucher market.\n\n245.\n\nRespondent argues that it did not redistribute or appropriate Claimant's profits for MN\u00dcA or the banks that are SZ\u00c9P Card issuers.163 Therefore, says Respondent, the Claimant's investment was not transferred to the state.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 22\n\n246.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal nonetheless finds that changes in the PIT law rendered Claimant's investment essentially worthless, and the value of Claimant's investment was indirectly transferred to a Hungarian state entity, which absorbed Claimant's market share.\n\n247.\n\nEven if Hungary characterizes MNUA as a charitable foundation, it was hand-selected and controlled by the state, and now has an effective monopoly over the voucher market. This same market was previously dominated, and arguably created, at least in part, by Claimant.\n\n248.\n\nWhile no direct transfer nor seizure of the shareholdings themselves occurred, the Parties themselves agree that this is not required, in accordance with the definition above. The value of the Claimant's shares was indirectly transferred to the state when state-selected and state-owned entities gained a monopoly over the market that Claimant once dominated.\n\n**B. Tribunal Analysis and Conclusion**\n---------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nOn balance, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that Hungary's PIT reforms caused an indirect expropriation of Claimant's property, its shareholdings in SPH. Changes to the tax regime substantially deprived Claimant of the fundamental attributes of property in its investment, including the right to use and enjoy its property. The PIT changes rendered Claimant's investment essentially worthless and resulted in the previous value of Claimant's investment being transferred indirectly to the state.\n\n250.\n\nWhat characterizes indirect expropriation is precisely that the value of the property (here, the shares) is impaired to such an extent as to destroy it substantially, even if the property as such (the shares) has not been taken. Had the state's measures been taken against the shares themselves, this would be a case of direct (not indirect) expropriation.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that another distinctive feature of indirect expropriation, as opposed to the breach of other standards of treatment, is that the value of the investor's property or rights is not only diminished, or destroyed, but also indirectly transferred to the state or to entities selected by the state.\n\n252.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal finds that Hungary\u2019s changes to the PIT regime substantially deprived Claimant of the fundamental attributes of property in its investment and resulted in the previous value of Claimant\u2019s investment being transferred indirectly to the state. Therefore, the economic impact on Claimant suggests that an indirect expropriation occurred.\n\n253.\n\nIn his separate and dissenting opinion, Mr. Thomas contends that a temporary dispossession occurred, rather than an expropriation. According to Mr. Thomas, this conclusion imposes itself because Claimant\u2019s competitor Edenred was able to re-enter the market after the 2017 PIT reforms.\n\n254.\n\nThe Majority disagrees. An expropriation occurred notwithstanding that for whatever reason another competitor chose to remain in the market. The Majority disposes of very limited information on the reasons, circumstances and consequences of Edenred\u2019s decision to remain in the market. The Majority is therefore wary to draw any conclusion from that case. Respondent\u2019s own financial expert admitted that he had no insight at all into why Edenred decided to stay in the Hungarian market, or whether Edenred might succeed or might fail. Moreover, the impact of the same measures on different businesses may diverge. In one case, measures may seriously affect a company\u2019s profitability without precluding it from remaining in the market. In another case, the same measures may completely destroy the investment.\n\n255.\n\nMoreover, Edenred was in the minority among the three French issuers. Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner, like Sodexo, decided to leave the Hungarian market in 2014.\n\n**VII.** ***BONA FIDE*** **REGULATORY MEASURES**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Overview**\n---------------\n\n256.\n\nRespondent argues that the PIT reforms did not constitute an indirect expropriation because they constituted a *bona fide* regulatory measure.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal must next determine, then, whether the PIT reforms constituted a *bona fide* regulatory measure rather than an indirect expropriation.\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis in this part of the Award is limited to the question of whether the measures at issue, the PIT reforms, constituted an indirect expropriation. Lawfulness of the expropriation will be discussed below.\n\n259.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes a certain overlap in arguments related to whether the measures were *bona fide* regulatory measures and the matter of lawfulness of an expropriation. Issues of whether the PIT reforms were made for a public purpose and were discriminatory are relevant to both matters. However, these are two separate legal analyses, and will be treated as such, despite the overlap.\n\n260.\n\nIn their post-hearing briefs, both Parties accepted the following statement, formulated by this Tribunal, of how to distinguish between a *bona fide* regulatory measure and an indirect expropriation at customary international law.164 That statement reads as follows.\n\nIn general, the determination of whether a measure or series of measures by a Party, in a specific situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors: the economic impact of the measure(s) and its duration, although the fact that a measure or a series of measures by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred; the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with the possibility to use, enjoy or dispose of the property; and the character of the measure or series of measures, notably its object, context and intent. For greater certainty, except in the rare circumstance where the impact of a measure or series of measures is so severe in light of its purpose that it appears manifestly excessive, non-discriminatory measure or series of measures by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public policy objectives do not constitute indirect expropriation.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 13; Resp. PHB, para. 50.\n\n261.\n\nOn the facts of the case, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that the PIT reforms were not *bona fide* regulatory measures, and therefore militate in favor of a finding of indirect expropriation.\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal has already analyzed the economic impact of the measures, and the extent to which the measures interfered with Claimant\u2019s possibility to use, enjoy, and dispose of its property. Applying the analysis above, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that these factors militate in favor of the PIT reforms constituting an indirect expropriation and not a *bona fide* regulatory measure.\n\n263.\n\nThe Tribunal will now analyze the other factors encapsulated by the agreed-upon definition distinguishing a *bona fide* regulatory measure from an indirect expropriation. Namely, the Tribunal will analyze the character of the series of measures, including their object, content, intent, their severity, and whether they were non-discriminatory.\n\n264.\n\nThe definition does not specify that these criteria must be met in the cumulative.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these criteria overlap. The Tribunal\u2019s \"object, content, and intent\" analysis will include discussion of whether the measures were enacted for a legitimate public policy purpose, in accordance with the definition above.\n\n266.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the \"object, content, and intent\" analysis means that the object, content, and intent of the regulations must be proportionate to the ends to be achieved.165 Claimant\u2019s discussion of proportionality overlaps with its argument about the \"severity\" of the measures. While the proportionality language is not part of the agreed-upon definition above, it is reflected in the caselaw cited by Claimant as part of its argument.166 Thus, the Tribunal will analyze the proportionality of the measures below when determining whether the object, content, and intent of the measures justified their severity.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 13.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 52, footnote 107.\n\n**B. Object, Content, Intent, and Policy Objectives**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nWith respect to Hungary's intent in undertaking the series of acts that led to the alleged indirect expropriation, the Tribunal notes that the Parties' post-hearing briefs agree that the Tribunal must consider a state's intent in taking the allegedly expropriatory measures.167\n\nCl. PHB, para. 15; Resp. PHB, para. 53.\n\n268.\n\nThe Parties seem to accept that a state's intent is not necessarily decisive of whether the expropriation is unlawful. Claimant says that a state's intent alone is not required to determine the *bona fides* of the tax measures, but is relevant.168 Respondent also admits that, per relevant caselaw, the state's intent is not necessarily decisive, but notes that many tribunals are dealing with substantially different circumstances.169\n\nCl. PHB, para. 15.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 54.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it could find the expropriation to be unlawful even if it were unable to determine the state's intent, based on the lack of compensation and/or a finding of discrimination.\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimant says that the Tribunal must evaluate a state's intent based on the totality of the circumstances, including the \"object, context, and intent\" referenced in the Parties' agreed-upon definition of indirect expropriation.170\n\nCl. PHB, para. 15.\n\n271.\n\nRespondent takes a more limited view of what the Tribunal should consider when determining a state's intent. Regarding regulatory measures and particularly tax or fiscal measures of general application \"there is a more prominent view that such measures will only result in liability where there is an intention to harm the investor or force it to abandon its property.\"171 Respondent says that, \"barring obvious and gross abuse of power, the Tribunal's exercise is respectfully limited to confirming the *prima facie* existence of a public purpose behind the measures.\"172\n\nResp. PHB, paras. 55-56, citing *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability (December 14, 2012), para. 376, citing Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, Section 712, cmt. G (1987) (RL-0007 and RL-0135).\n\nResp. PHB, para. 57.\n\n272.\n\nThis Tribunal finds that applying Respondent's standard would allow any state to articulate a *prima facie* public purpose behind measures that are discriminatory beneath the surface. Thus, this Tribunal must investigate whether a purpose lies beyond Hungary's articulation of a public purpose for the PIT reforms. To do so, the Tribunal will consider the totality of the circumstances, including the \"object, context, and intent\" of the alleged expropriatory measures.173\n\nCl. PHB, para. 15.\n\n273.\n\nOn balance, the Majority of the Tribunal finds the argument that Hungary's primary intent in enacting the PIT reforms was to keep foreign voucher issuers out of the market more persuasive than the argument that Hungary's motivation for the reforms was for charitable purposes or to pursue a public purpose.\n\n274.\n\nIt is clear that Hungary had at least a *prima facie* public welfare purpose in mind when enacting the PIT reforms. Vouchers themselves served a social purpose in helping to provide healthy meals to Hungarians. Naturally, any reforms related to the voucher system would therefore be related to some social purpose.\n\n275.\n\nHungary's stated objectives in enacting the reforms were: to guarantee that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers had experience and presence in Hungary, to fight corruption, to reduce the fees charged to customers, and to expand tourism and support healthy eating.174\n\nResp. C-Mem., paras. 73, 136-138.\n\n276.\n\nIn support of its claim that the voucher system reforms were made for a public purpose, Respondent asserts that it conducted a review of the voucher system that revealed, \"numerous structural problems, rampant misuse, and economic inefficiencies inherent in the voucher system.\"175\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 62.\n\n277.\n\nHungary identified six primary problems with the voucher system,176 including 1) a lack of audits or controls on issuers who were investing large sums of money, which put customers at risk;177 2) issuer\u2019s inability to monitor vouchers, resulting in vouchers being used for items other than food;178 3) vouchers being used as *de facto* currency, resulting in a secondary market for vouchers;179 4) issuers keeping revenue from vouchers that were never redeemed, creating an advantage for issuers at taxpayers\u2019 expense;180 5) issuers charging 6-10% commission to employers and merchants, thereby diverting tax benefits from the intended recipients;181 and 6) in case of loss or theft, voucher holders had no recourse.182 Respondent asserts that it needed to reform the voucher system to rectify these failings.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 62.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 63.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 64.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 65.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 66.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 67.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 68.\n\n278.\n\nHowever, Respondent was unable to produce any documents supporting that such a review had been taken.183 In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent cites a report by Ernst and Young that it \"had commissioned to analyze the fringe-benefit related legislative and tax frameworks in force in other countries\" as part of its comprehensive review. The report presents only a general overview of the fringe benefit systems used in other countries, and does not discuss their successes and failures. Moreover, the report is dated March 2012, after the 2012 PIT reforms had been drafted and come into force.184\n\n*See* Tr. Day 2, 459:6-488:22 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination).\n\n*See* also Tr. Day 2, 461:2-462:12 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination).\n\n279.\n\nAt the hearings, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] both testified that they did not become involved in the PIT reform process until after these alleged reviews had been taken.1 85 Respondent was unable to produce any documentary evidence nor any witnesses to show that Respondent had any reason for concern, prior to the enactment of the PIT reforms, about its or any specific voucher issuer's capitalization or ability to meet payment obligations, allegations of voucher misuse, or excessively high commissions.186\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 91-93.\n\n280.\n\nMultiple statements by government officials at the time of the PIT reforms strongly suggest that the reforms were not merely made for a public purpose.187 Claimant submits many statements by Hungarian leaders made at the time the PIT reforms were enacted that suggest that Respondent intended for the reforms to discriminate against foreign voucher issuers.188 Many politicians and ministers stated their goal for profits from the voucher system to remain in Hungary, for the voucher system to be state-owned rather than involve French issuers, and for foreign companies to no longer profit from the voucher system.189\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 159-165.\n\n*See* Cl. PHB, paras. 81-88.\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 159-165.\n\n281.\n\nMoreover, when Claimant made efforts to meet with Hungarian leaders to discuss a compromise before the PIT reforms were enacted, they were largely rebuffed.190\n\n*See* Cl. Mem., paras.145-165.\n\n282.\n\nOn balance, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that the words and actions of Hungarian officials suggest that the PIT reforms were not made for a public purpose. Despite Hungary's stated *prima facie* public purpose, the reforms, as enacted, were not clearly designed to achieve their purported ends.\n\n283.\n\nHungary was free to reform its PIT. It would have been possible for Hungary to do so in a way that did not result in indirect expropriation. The specific PIT reforms that Hungary adopted in the present case were intended to exclude Claimant from the market and succeeded in doing so.\n\n284.\n\nThe issue of the public purposes of the reforms will be discussed further in the analysis of severity of the measures, below.\n\n**C. Severity of the Measures**\n-------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal will analyze the severity of the measures according to the definition above that was accepted by the Parties.\n\n286.\n\nAs discussed above, the economic impact of the measures was severe. The effect of the PIT reforms was to strip Claimant's investment of its value. The measures severely damaged Claimant's ability to use, enjoy, or dispose of the shareholdings.\n\n287.\n\nThe question then remains as to whether the object, content, and intent of the reforms were proportional to the severity of the reforms.\n\n288.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal is persuaded that the severity of Hungary's PIT reforms was not proportional to the objectives stated above. As stated above, Hungary has articulated a public purpose in changing the PIT law. Hungary's stated objectives were as follows: to guarantee that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers had experience and presence in Hungary; to fight corruption; to reduce fees charged to customers; and to expand tourism while supporting healthy eating. Hungary argues these ends justified the tax reforms.\n\n289.\n\nThe SZ\u00c9P Decree of 13 April 2011, which specified the conditions that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers must meet, specified the following:191\n\n4. Conditions of the issuance of the card\n\nSection 13\n\n(1) Any service provider defined in section 2 (2) point d) of Act XCVI of 1993 on Voluntary Mutual Insurance Founds, with the exception of natural persons is entitled to issue the card, which is established for an undefined term or for a fixed term of at least 5 years from the beginning of its activities as issuer, which (together with the companies operating as an acknowledged or implied company group as defined in Act IV of 2006 on Business Associations) fulfills the following conditions together:\n\na) maintains a place of service open to clients in every Hungarian settlement with more than 35.000 residents;\n\nb) has at least 100,000 credit cards issued by itself according to the data of the closed business year;\n\nc) has at least 2 year experience on the field [sic] of issuing the electronic voucher cards used for enjoying non-salary benefits defined in Section 71 of the PIT Act, and the number of the voucher cards issued by it exceed 25,000 according to the data of the last closed business year.\n\n*See* Government Decree 55/2011 (IV. 12.) on the Rules of Issuance and Use of the Sz\u00e9chenyi Recreation Card, in force as of April 13, 2011 (RL-0063)\n\n290.\n\nBased on these conditions, only three banks qualified to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card: OTP, K&H, and MKB. At the time of enacting the SZ\u00c9P Decree, Hungary knew that these were the only three entities that would meet its new criteria.192 SPI, Edenred and Ch\u00e8que Dejeuner, the three French issuers who had 85% of the voucher issuance market share at the time of the SZ\u00c9P Decree, did not satisfy the Decree's conditions.193\n\n*See* Tr. Day 2, 453:22 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination)\n\nRfA, para. 58.\n\n291.\n\nThe Hungarian government had a financial interest in at least two of the SZ\u00c9P Card issuers, and its interests have increased over time. The Hungarian state has had a 5.12% stake in OTP and 100% stake in MKB since 29 September 2014.194 In March 2016, [REDACTED] a witness at the hearings in this case who was in [REDACTED], the entity that issues SZ\u00c9P Cards.195 [REDACTED]196\n\nCl. Mem., para. 81.\n\nTr. Day 2, 305:16-306:9 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination)\n\nTr. Day 2, 306:10-18 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination)\n\n292.\n\nRespondent notes that MKB was solely German-owned from 2010 to 2014, K&H was and still is a Belgian bank, and 62.5% of OTP\u2019s shareholders were foreign individuals as of December 2011.197\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 82.\n\n293.\n\nHungary does not deny that its reforms had the effect of limiting the SZ\u00c9P Card issuers to these three banks. However, it argues that doing so was entirely justified in light of its stated social purpose.\n\n294.\n\nThe SZ\u00c9P Decree was amended on 16 June 2011, to limit the size of commissions that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers could charge hotel merchants, and that hotel merchants could charge other merchants providing ancillary services such as restaurant services.198 Claimant argues that these limits constituted an additional barrier to market entry because only entities that could depend on other lines of business could afford to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card.199\n\nCl. Mem., para. 83.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 85; Resp. C-Mem., paras. 81-82.\n\n295.\n\nHungary\u2019s stated social objective was not supported by the reforms enacted in the SZ\u00c9P Decree. Hungary asserted that having banks with a large presence in Hungary would give them the expertise and presence necessary to serve Hungarians. Yet Hungary offered no justification or explanation as to how having three pre-chosen institutions able to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card was necessary to obtain their stated objectives.\n\n296.\n\nHungary has not offered any specific arguments why the SZ\u00c9P Decree's issuance requirements were necessary and proportionate for Hungary to achieve its stated objectives of protecting consumers and creditors. Hungary has not presented any evidence that it considered alternative plans, such as establishing a system for supervising voucher issuers or creating a bank guarantee mechanism. Hungary has not justified why it had to give state vouchers preferential tax treatment, even going so far as to create a state monopoly on vouchers, in order to achieve its stated public purpose.\n\n297.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that the severe impact of Hungary's PIT reforms was not proportional to its stated objectives, thereby suggesting that an expropriation occurred. Hungary effectively hand-selected three banks (with two of which it had close financial ties) to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card; and chose a state-owned entity to issue the Ersz\u00e9bet vouchers. Nowhere does Hungary explain how these means justified its stated ends of guaranteeing that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers had experience and presence in Hungary, fighting corruption, reducing customer fees, expanding tourism, and supporting healthy eating. Hungary's means are not proportional (and not obviously related) to its ends.\n\n298.\n\nThus, Hungary's severe PIT reforms were not proportional to its goals. The severe economic impact of the reforms on the Claimant was unjustified. Hungary restricted entry to the voucher market, excluding the French voucher issuers who had dominated the market for decades, and instead effectively hand-selected entities to issue the SZ\u00c9P and Ersz\u00e9bet vouchers. Hungary also has not articulated how the reforms would have led to its stated ends of protecting consumers and creditors, fighting corruption, expanding tourism, and supporting healthy eating. The disproportionality of Hungary's measures to achieving its ends suggests that the reforms were not *bona fide* regulatory measures.\n\n299.\n\nEven if proportionality is not required for the Tribunal to find that the measures were *bona fide*, Hungary has not adequately explained how its actions would lead to its stated goals. Nor has Respondent shown that alternative ways of achieving its goals were even considered.\n\n**D. Indirect Expropriation versus** ***Bona Fide*** **Regulatory Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nOn balance, for the reasons discussed below, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that all of the factors that distinguish between a *bona fide* regulatory measure and an indirect expropriation, according to the definition agreed by the Parties, militate in favor of a finding that the relevant measures considered by this Tribunal constitute an indirect expropriation.\n\n301.\n\nIn its fact-based inquiry, the Majority of the Tribunal has considered the economic impact of all relevant measures and their duration, the extent to which the series of measures interfered with Claimant\u2019s possibility to use and enjoy its property, and the character of the series of measures, notably their object, context and intent. These measures viewed in their totality all lead to a conclusion of indirect expropriation.\n\n302.\n\nThe severity of the series of measures considered makes them excessive in light of their stated purpose. The Majority cannot find the measures as designed or applied to protect Hungary\u2019s stated policy goals.\n\n303.\n\nThus, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that the measures constituted an indirect expropriation.\n\n304.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal has noted that no fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") claim is before this Tribunal, nor any general claim of discriminatory treatment. Therefore, the Tribunal considers the issue of discrimination in tax measures as only one factor in determining whether the measures were *bona fide* or constituted unlawful expropriation.\n\n305.\n\nThis factor is part of an ensemble of indicia to be considered in making the distinction between a *bona fide* regulatory measure and an indirect expropriation, as defined by the Parties in their post-hearing briefs.\n\n306.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal could have made its determination that an expropriation occurred based on the other factors discussed in this Award, as noted above. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal addresses discrimination as part of the factual matrix which the Parties presented for consideration.\n\n307.\n\nNeither side offers a clear definition of discrimination as relevant in this arbitration. Respondent appears to suggest that, to be relevant, discrimination must aim at Claimant specifically, singling out SPI in particular. By contrast, Claimant focuses more on discrimination in general, against foreign voucher issuers. Claimant\u2019s claim is distinct from what would constitute a discrimination claim under EU law.\n\n308.\n\nClaimant notes that neither the BIT nor relevant arbitral awards contain a definitive statement of what \"discriminatory\" means. However, tax measures cannot be arbitrary, discriminatory, confiscatory, or abusive. The Tribunal should consider the intent and effect of the tax measure in question when determining whether that measure is discriminatory. A tax measure \"crafted to force abandonment of a business enterprise by ruining its economic value, or to provide an investor\u2019s competitors with a beneficial fiscal framework that permits more favorable competition\" would qualify as abusive.200 To constitute an expropriation, a tax measure must also substantially deprive the investor of its use and enjoyment of the investment.201 Claimant argues that the SZ\u00c9P Decree and subsequent creation of the SZ\u00c9P Card and Ersz\u00e9bet voucher had the effect of creating a new market framework that favored its competitors to the point that its investments lost their value and it was forced to close SPH, making the reforms qualify as discriminatory and abusive.\n\nCl.

Brekoulakis (Eds.), Arbitrability: International and Comparative Perspectives, 179-205 (2009), Kluwer Law International, paras. 10-21 (CL-0080).\n\nCl. PHB, para. 18.\n\n309.\n\nRespondent appears to agree with Claimant that no clear and definitive requirements exist to determine when *bona fide* tax reforms are discriminatory. However, Respondent then further narrows the definition of discrimination. Under the BIT\u2019s provisions regarding expropriation, a state cannot undertake abusive or illegitimate measures that interfere with a distinct property right, and that substantially deprive an investor of the use or control of its investment.202\n\nResp. PHB, para. 62.\n\n310.\n\nRespondent reiterates that, generally, a state has the power to adopt *bona fide* measures (1) for the public interest (2) that are non-discriminatory and (3) do not contravene any specific undertaking.203 Respondent further notes a presumption of deference to the state in relevant prior awards.204 Thus, normal tax policies, practices of revenue generation, or shifting normal fiscal burden have not been likely to result in liability.205 Respondent argues that if tax reforms were not *bona fide*, and even discriminatory, these measures would not necessarily be tantamount to expropriation under the BIT or international law.206 The measures would need to have interfered with a distinct property right, and dispossession of the investment must have occurred. Respondent notes that the Tribunal must make a fact-intensive inquiry to determine whether the tax measures are illegitimate or abusive, and therefore constitute discrimination.207\n\nResp. PHB, para. 61.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 65.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 66.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 69.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 64.\n\n311.\n\nIn the absence of a clear definition of \"discrimination,\" Respondent argues that the term must be understood in the context of the particular tax measures at issue.208 In this context, \"discrimination does not mean differentiating between two taxpayers or products,\" because all tax measures necessarily differentiate between taxpayers or products.209 In a situation where merely a different impact exists between different actors, it will be unlikely that a claimant can establish improper discrimination.210\n\nResp. PHB, para. 41.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 41.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 41, citing United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, *Expropriation a Sequel,* UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II, at 96, UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2011/7, U.N. Sales No. E.12.II.D.7 (2012) (RL-0151). The passage further provides that discrimination covers racial, religious, ethnic and other types of discrimination prohibited under customary international law, but these concerns are not alleged to be at issue here. *See* also *Link-Trading Joint Stock Company v. Department for Customs Control of the Republic of Moldova,* UNCITRAL, Final Award (April 18, 2002), para. 69 (changes to the annually amended annual budget were not arbitrary or discriminatory because they were of general application and not directed specifically at the claimant). (RL-0021).\n\n312.\n\nClaimant points to the CJEU case *Commission v. Hungary,* as did the *Edenred v. Hungary* tribunal, when determining that the reforms were discriminatory. The CJEU ruled that Erzs\u00e9bet and SZ\u00c9P Card regulations were unlawful because they were disproportionate, discriminatory, and not justified by the public interest.211 The exact meal vouchers in question indirectly discriminated against non-Hungarian EU nationals, and thereby violated the principles of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services guaranteed by EU law.212 As Respondent notes, the CJEU proceedings involve related but different issues than the BIT, and a violation of EU law does not necessarily mean a BIT violation.213\n\nCl. PHB, para. 19.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 20.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 70.\n\n313.\n\nIn the post-hearing briefs, the Tribunal asked Claimant whether the state could permissibly eliminate the tax benefit granted to hot and cold meal vouchers entirely, or regulate maximum commissions chargeable to employers and affiliates. Claimant replied that Hungary could have lawfully adopted reforms by adopting measures that affected all voucher issuers equally. For example, Hungary could have eliminated tax benefits for meal vouchers entirely or limited commission levels. Such hypothetical reforms would have had a proven public purpose proportionate to Hungary's stated aims and been non-discriminatory, rather than \"imbued with improper intent against Claimant.\"214 Claimant clarified for the Tribunal that the gravamen of its claim in this case is that the post-2010 voucher reforms were motivated by Hungary's improper intent to replace French businesses with state-chosen actors. It did so through discriminatory taxes that were not justified by a proven public purpose nor proportionate to Hungary\u2019s stated aims.215 Respondent replied that if this is the gravamen of Claimant\u2019s claim, then Claimant\u2019s argument is inconsistent. Claimant has never explained why only the challenged reforms gave rise to a claim, while the 2010 reforms do not.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 21.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 22.\n\n314.\n\nIn this connection, Claimant seems to say that the 2012 measures had a more significant effect, and that the 2010 reforms were not discriminatory. Respondent suggests that according to Claimant\u2019s explanation of the gravamen of its claim, both should have been problematic.216\n\nResp. PHB, paras. 78-85.\n\n315.\n\nClaimant\u2019s arguments, according to Respondent, primarily involve nationality-based discrimination. Respondent argues that the measures at issue applied to all Hungarian taxpayers equally, not just to the Claimant or foreign investors. Therefore, says Respondent, the reforms cannot be said to discriminate against foreigners.\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Claimant\u2019s broader view of the meaning of \"discrimination.\" The narrow view that a claim of discrimination would require discrimination against Claimant specifically would mean that only instances of overt discrimination would violate the BIT. Indirect expropriation is, by definition, subtler.\n\n317.\n\nThus, an analysis of discrimination in the instant case must involve the Tribunal\u2019s scrutiny of whether Hungary wished to exclude certain players from the voucher market when adopting the allegedly expropriatory reforms.\n\n318.\n\nOn balance, the Majority of the Tribunal finds Claimant\u2019s argument more persuasive. The tax regime places a higher tax burden on Claimant\u2019s vouchers as compared to SZ\u00c9P Cards and Ersz\u00e9bet vouchers, without objective justifications for doing so. In a market dominated by a few players (essentially, the three French meal voucher issuers), the PIT reforms were not general and indiscriminate, but aimed at favoring state-chosen entities.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a thin line exists between indirect expropriation and non-expropriatory abusive conduct that has an adverse effect on the economic value of the investment.\n\n320.\n\nPrior to enacting the SZ\u00c9P Decree, Hungary had full knowledge that it chose the SZ\u00c9P issuance criteria in a way that discriminated against Claimant and other market leaders.217 While the SZ\u00c9P Decree has language that ostensibly applies to all financial institutions, the record shows that Hungary knew that only three institutions would meet its stringent criteria. Hungary, therefore, effectively hand-selected the institutions that would issue the SZ\u00c9P Card.\n\nTr. Day 2, 357:3-373:20 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination)\n\n321.\n\nHungary's intent to discriminate against foreign investors is further evidenced by the statements and actions of Hungarian officials prior to the PIT reforms. As discussed above, Claimant has documented many statements by Hungarian leaders made at the time the PIT reforms were enacted that suggest that Respondent intended for the reforms to be discriminatory against foreign voucher issuers.218 Many politicians and ministers stated their goals in enacting the reforms included profits from the voucher system remaining in Hungary, the voucher system to be state-owned rather than involve French issuers, and for foreign companies to no longer profit from the voucher system.219\n\n*See* Cl. PHB, para. 81-88.\n\nId.\n\n322.\n\nRelevant case law supports the finding that Respondent's tax regime was discriminatory. While the Tribunal reiterates that decisions by other tribunals are not binding on this Tribunal, the Tribunal recognizes the importance of consistency in international investment law.\n\n323.\n\nIn *Commission v. Hungary,* the CJEU found that the SZ\u00c9P and Ersz\u00e9bet regulations were disproportionate to Hungary's stated aims of protecting users and creditors, not justified by these stated aims, and discriminated against foreign issuers. While the EU regulations at issue in that case differ from the BIT provisions, the CJEU\u2019s analysis of discrimination, proportionality, and the alleged public purpose of the tax reforms are highly relevant to this arbitration.\n\n324.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal stresses its disagreement with the suggestion by Mr. Thomas that the Majority has \"given full effect to the Court of Justice's ruling in\" *Commission v. Hungary.* The majority does not \"rely\" on any CJEU opinion. Indeed, such reliance would be highly problematic in an investor-state arbitration such as the present case. Rather, the Majority has considered findings of EU bodies, including the CJEU, not as binding on this ICSID Tribunal, but as aids to analytic clarity.\n\n325.\n\nRespondent cites *EnCana v. Ecuador* for the proposition that a tax regime is presumptively a *bona fide* regulatory measure. In *EnCana v. Ecuador,* the tribunal found that Ecuador did not breach its BIT with Canada when it changed its VAT law and subsequently denied a VAT refund to two Canadian subsidiaries that had contracts with the Ecuadorian state oil agency. The tribunal found that, absent a specific commitment from the host state, a foreign investor has neither a right nor a legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not change.220 Only in an extreme case will a general tax be considered equivalent in effect to an expropriation.221 Although the VAT reforms financially harmed EnCana\u2019s subsidiaries, both were able to function profitably and engage in their normal range of activities in their core businesses of extracting and exporting oil.\n\n*EnCana,* at para. 173.\n\n*EnCana,* at para. 173.\n\n326.\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador* differs substantially from the instant case. The expropriation claim in *EnCana* failed because the changes in the tax regime were not egregious enough to be equivalent to an expropriation. The claimants in *EnCana v. Ecuador* were not deprived of the use of their investment, nor were their investments deprived of their value.\n\n327.\n\nBy contrast, Hungary\u2019s PIT reforms completely deprived SPI of the use and enjoyment of its investment in SPH and rendered its shareholdings worthless. SPI was no longer able to function in the voucher market in Hungary, which was effectively taken over by state and state-chosen entities as a result of the reforms. Although in theory the reform was general, *de facto* it had a direct, exclusive, and intentional impact on Claimant and the other two French voucher operators. Unlike in *EnCana,* the PIT reforms in our case constitute an expropriation.\n\n328.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that Hungary's PIT reforms were discriminatory against foreign voucher issuers, including the Claimant, leading to a finding that expropriation occurred.\n\n**VIII. LAWFULNESS OF THE EXPROPRIATION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Overview**\n---------------\n\n329.\n\nHaving determined that an indirect expropriation occurred, the Majority of the Tribunal now turns to the question of whether that expropriation was lawful.\n\n330.\n\nThe Parties agreed in their post-hearing briefs that the BIT prohibits only unlawful dispossession, articulated in Article 5(2) of the BIT as \"mesures d'exportation [*sic*] ou de nationalisation ou toutes mesures dont l'effet est de d\u00e9poss\u00e9der, directement ou indirectement, les investisseurs de l'autre Partie...\"222\n\nCl. PHB, para. 5; Resp. PHB, para. 32.\n\n331.\n\nOn analysis of the facts of the record and legal principles, the Majority of the Tribunal has been persuaded that the expropriation was unlawful.\n\n332.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n2. Les Parties contractantes ne prennent pas de mesures d'exportation [*sic: to be read \u00abexpropriation \u00bb*] ou de nationalisation ou toutes autres mesures dont l'effet est de d\u00e9poss\u00e9der, directement ou indirectement, les investisseurs de l'autre Partie des investissements leur appartenant sur son territoire et dans ses zones maritimes, si ce n'est pour cause d'utilit\u00e9 publique et \u00e0 condition que ces mesures ne soient pas discriminatoires, ni contraires \u00e0 un engagement particulier.\n\nLes mesures de d\u00e9possession qui pourraient \u00eatre prises doivent donner lieu au paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 prompte et ad\u00e9quate dont le montant devra correspondre \u00e0 la valeur r\u00e9elle des investissements concern\u00e9s \u00e0 la veille du jour ou les mesures sont prises ou connues dans le public.\n\nCette indemnit\u00e9 sera pay\u00e9e aux investisseurs en monnaie convertible, et sera librement transf\u00e9rable. Elle sera vers\u00e9e sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 compter de la date de la d\u00e9possession, faute de quoi elle produira jusqu'\u00e0 la date du versement des int\u00e9r\u00eats calcules au taux du march\u00e9 appropri\u00e9.\n\nIn English translation:223\n\n2. The Contracting Parties shall not take any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures which could cause the investors of the other Party to be dispossessed, directly or indirectly, of the investments belonging to them in its territory and maritime zones, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that these measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.\n\nAny dispossession measures taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which must equal the real value of the investments concerned on the day prior to the date on which the measures are taken or made public.\n\nSuch compensation shall be payable to investors in convertible funds, and shall be freely transferable. It shall be paid promptly starting from the date of dispossession, failing which, interest calculated at the applicable market rate shall be charged up to the date of payment.\n\nRL-0046. Note that Claimant uses a different, \"free translation from the French original,\" (CL-0001) in its submissions. Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, para. 210, translates these provisions as, \"The Contracting Parties shall not take measures of [expropriation] or nationalization or any other measures which have the effect of dispossessing, directly or indirectly, the investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments in their territory and maritime zones, except for a public purpose and provided that such measures are neither discriminatory nor contrary to a specific commitment. Any measures of dispossession which could be adopted must result in the payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the value of which shall correspond to the real value of the investment on the day before the measures were taken or became public knowledge.\" These variations are not significant for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n333.\n\nTo be lawful, an expropriation must (i) involve a taking for a public purpose, (ii) be non-discriminatory or not contrary to a specific commitment, and (iii) result in the payment of prompt and adequate compensation.224\n\nCl. PHB, para. 5; Resp. PHB, para. 35.\n\n334.\n\nIn their post-hearing briefs, the Parties agreed that under Article 5(2) of the BIT, these three conditions must be satisfied cumulatively.225\n\nCl. PHB, para. 7; Resp. PHB, para. 35.\n\n335.\n\nNeither party argues that any compensation was paid to Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal needs only address the first and second elements, which is to say, public purpose and non-discrimination.\n\n**B. Tribunal Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n336.\n\nWith respect to the second element of lawfulness, the Tribunal notes that it appears uncontested that Respondent made no specific commitment to Claimant for maintaining a favorable tax regime. Thus, the issues for the Tribunal analysis must center on whether the expropriation was (i) for a public purpose and (ii) non-discriminatory.\n\n**(1) Public Purpose**\n----------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal finds that Hungary\u2019s PIT reforms were not enacted for a public purpose, making the expropriation unlawful. Some Hungarian lawmakers may have supported the reforms solely for charitable purposes and to reduce fraud in the voucher system. Upon closer examination, however, the justification behind the reforms and the manner in which the reforms were enacted belies a purpose of discrimination against foreign voucher issuers.\n\n338.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal must determine what it must consider when deciding whether a state had a legitimate public purpose in its expropriation. Respondent takes a limited view of what the Tribunal should consider when determining a state\u2019s intent in enacting reforms. Respondent argues that, regarding regulatory measures and especially tax or fiscal measures of general application, the prevailing view is that \"such measures will only result in liability where there is an intention to harm the investor or force them to abandon their property.\"226\n\nResp. PHB, para. 55-56, citing *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability (December 14, 2012), para. 376, citing Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, Section 712, cmt. G (1987) (RL-0007 and RL-0135).\n\n339.\n\nRespondent says that, \"barring obvious and gross abuse of power, the Tribunal's exercise is respectfully limited to confirming the *prima facie* existence of a public purpose behind the measures.\"227 This Tribunal finds that applying Respondent's standard would allow any state to articulate a *prima facie* public purpose behind discriminatory measures. Thus, this Tribunal must engage in an intensive, fact-based investigation of whether the PIT reforms had a public purpose and served one.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 57.\n\n340.\n\nOn balance, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that Hungary's primary intent in enacting the PIT reforms was to keep foreign voucher issuers out of the market. Hungary's argument that it enacted the reforms for charitable purposes appears doubtful after examination of the lack of a relationship between the stated purpose of the reforms and their content.\n\n341.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal acknowledges that Hungary may have had at least a *prima facie* public purpose in mind when choosing to reform the PIT. Since vouchers themselves serve a social purpose by helping to provide healthy meals to Hungarians, any voucher system reforms would inherently be related to some social purpose.\n\n342.\n\nHungary's stated objectives in enacting the reforms were: to guarantee that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers had experience and presence in Hungary, to fight corruption, to reduce the fees charged to customers, and to expand tourism and support healthy eating.228\n\nResp. C-Mem., paras. 73, 136-138.\n\n343.\n\nHowever, Hungary presented scant evidence of an actual need to reform the voucher system to improve the public good. In support of its claim that the voucher system reforms were made for a public purpose, Respondent asserts that it conducted a review of the voucher system that revealed \"numerous structural problems, rampant misuse, and economic inefficiencies inherent in the voucher system.\"229 Hungary identified six primary problems with the voucher system,230 including 1) a lack of audits or controls on issuers who were investing large sums of money, which put customers at risk;231 2) issuers' inability to monitor vouchers, resulting in vouchers being used for items other than food;232 3) vouchers being used as *de facto* currency, resulting in a secondary market for vouchers;233 4) issuers keeping revenue from vouchers that were never redeemed, creating an advantage for issuers at taxpayers' expense;234 5) issuers charging 6-10% commission to employers and merchants, thereby diverting tax benefits from the intended recipients;235 and 6) in case of loss or theft, voucher holders had no recourse.236 Respondent asserts that it needed to reform the voucher system to rectify these failings.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 62.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 61.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 63.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 64.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 65.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 66.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 67.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 68.\n\n344.\n\nHowever, Respondent was unable to produce any documents to support that a review of the voucher system had occurred.237 As noted above, Respondent's Counter-Memorial cites a March 2012 report by Ernst and Young that it \"had commissioned to analyze the fringe-benefit related legislative and tax frameworks in force in other countries\" as part of such a review. While the report outlines the voucher frameworks in other countries, the report does not analyze the specific workings of other fringe benefit systems. Moreover, the report postdates the enactment of the 2012 PIT reforms.238\n\nTr. Day 2, 459:6-488:22 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination)\n\n*See* also Tr. Day 2, 461:2-462:12 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination).\n\n345.\n\nRespondent did not produce any documentary evidence nor any witnesses to show that Respondent had any reason for concern about any specific voucher issuer\u2019s capitalization or capacity to meet financial obligations, allegations of voucher misuse, or excessive commissions that would prompt enactment of the PIT reforms.239 Witnesses [REDACTED] both testified that they became involved in the PIT reform process only after the alleged reviews had occurred.240\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 91-93.\n\n*See* Tr. Day 2, 327:6-11; 349:4-7 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination) (noting that [REDACTED] joined the reform efforts in February, 2011, after the Government had already decided to create the SZEP Card); Tr. Day 2, 490:4-19 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination) (stating that [REDACTED] was appointed [REDACTED] in October 2011 with the mandate to turn the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher into a reality, the decision already having been made to launch it).\n\n346.\n\nHungarian politicians and ministers made a number of statements near the time of the PIT reforms that strongly suggest that they intended the reforms to discriminate against foreign voucher issuers.241 Such statements included that the goal of the reforms was for profits from the voucher system to remain in Hungary, for foreign companies to no longer profit from the voucher system, and for the system to be state-owned rather than involve French issuers.242\n\n*See* Cl. PHB, paras. 81-88.\n\nId.\n\n347.\n\nAlso, Claimant made reasonable efforts to meet with Hungarian leaders to discuss alternatives to the PIT reforms. However, its efforts were largely ignored or rejected.243\n\n*See* Cl. Mem., paras.145-165.\n\n348.\n\nAny discussion of public purpose will inevitably implicate notions of proportionality. In this connection, the Majority of the Tribunal has been persuaded that Hungary\u2019s PIT reforms were not proportional to the ends, belying its claim that the reforms were enacted for a public purpose, and rendering the expropriation unlawful.\n\n349.\n\nAs noted above, Respondent has set forth a public purpose for its PIT reforms. Hungary argues that the reforms were justified in order to fulfill these stated objectives: to guarantee that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers had experience and presence in Hungary, to fight corruption, to reduce customer fees, to expand tourism, and to support healthy eating.\n\n350.\n\nBased on the stringent conditions for SZ\u00c9P Card issuers set in Section 13 of the SZ\u00c9P Decree,244 reproduced above, only three banks qualified to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card: OTP, K&H, and MKB. When it enacted the SZ\u00c9P Decree, Hungary knew that only these three entities would meet its criteria.245 SPI, Edenred and Ch\u00e8que Dejeuner, the three French issuers who had 85% of the voucher issuance market share at the time of the SZ\u00c9P Decree, did not meet the Decree's criteria.246\n\nSee Government Decree 55/2011 (IV. 12.) on the Rules of Issuance and Use of the Sz\u00e9chenyi Recreation Card, in force as of April 13, 2011 (RL-0063).\n\nSee Tr. Day 2, 453:22 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination).\n\nRfA, para. 58.\n\n351.\n\nAs noted, Hungary does not deny that its reforms resulted in limiting the SZ\u00c9P Card issuers to these three banks, but argues that such limitation was justified in light of the stated social purpose.\n\n352.\n\nThe record seems to suggest otherwise, however. As an initial matter, the Hungarian government had a financial interest in at least two of the SZ\u00c9P Card issuers, which continued to increase while the entities came to dominate the voucher market. The Hungarian state has had a 5.12% stake in OTP and 100% stake in MKB since September 29, 2014.247\n\nMemorial, para. 81.\n\n353.\n\nSecond, Hungarian officials involved in the SZ\u00c9P Card reforms later became executives of these financial institutions. In March 2016, [REDACTED], a witness at the hearings in this arbitration who was in charge of the SZ\u00c9P Card regulations, became [REDACTED], the entity that issues SZ\u00c9P Cards.248 A colleague with whom he had drafted the SZ\u00c9P reforms is now MKB\u2019s Chief operating officer.249\n\nTr. Day 2, 305:16-306:9 ([REDACTED] Cross)\n\nTr. Day 2, 306:10-18 ([REDACTED] Cross)\n\n354.\n\nRespondent states that MKB was solely German-owned from 2010 to 2014, and K&H was and remains a Belgian bank. As of December 2011, 62.5% of OTP\u2019s shareholders were foreign individuals.250\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 82.\n\n355.\n\nHowever, it is telling that the Hungarian government chose to limit SZ\u00c9P Card issuers to three financial institutions in which it had financial and other interests while excluding entities who had 85% of the voucher market and in whom it had no financial interest.\n\n356.\n\nHungary then increased barriers to market entry to exclude issuers other than its three chosen financial institutions. Hungary amended the SZ\u00c9P Decree on June 16, 2011, to limit the commissions that SZ\u00c9P Card issuers could charge hotel merchants, and that hotel merchants could charge other merchants providing ancillary services such as restaurant services.251 Claimant argues that these limits constituted an additional barrier to market entry because only entities that could depend on other lines of business could afford to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card.252\n\nCl. Mem., para. 83.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 85; Resp. C-Mem., paras. 81-82.\n\n357.\n\nIt is unclear to the Majority of the Tribunal how these amendments served Hungary\u2019s stated public purpose. Hungary\u2019s stated social purpose was not supported by the justification and enactment of the reforms mandated by the SZ\u00c9P Decree.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal again notes that Hungary has not explained why it was necessary to have only three pre-chosen institutions issue the SZ\u00c9P Card, nor why the SZ\u00c9P Decree\u2019s issuance requirements should be considered necessary and proportionate in respect of Hungary\u2019s stated goal to protect consumers and creditors.\n\n359.\n\nHungary has not presented any evidence that it considered alternatives, such as establishing a system for supervising voucher issuers or creating a bank guarantee mechanism. Hungary has not justified why it had to create a state monopoly on vouchers\u2014or give state vouchers any preferential tax treatment at all\u2014in order to achieve its stated public purpose.\n\n360.\n\nRespondent argues that reforms were made for a social purpose because a charitable foundation issued the SZ\u00c9P Card. The fact that a charitable foundation benefitted from the reforms does not change the fact that SPI was dispossessed of its investment as a result of the reforms.\n\n361.\n\nAs the *Edenred v. Hungary* tribunal notes, deciding otherwise would open the floodgates for others to expropriate via non-profit public agencies.253 Although this Tribunal does not rely on the *Edenred* decision in reaching its conclusion, it shares that tribunal\u2019s concerns that to consider reforms acceptable merely because they benefitted a charitable foundation would open the door for unlawful expropriation by other states.\n\n*Edenred v. Hungary*, paras. 411-12.\n\n362.\n\nOn balance, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that Hungary\u2019s reforms were not made for a public purpose. Hungary has not adequately explained how the SZ\u00c9P and Ersz\u00e9bet programs and related reforms further any of Hungary\u2019s stated public purposes. The words and actions of Hungarian officials show that the measures were not aimed at any legitimate societal goal, but rather were intended to keep foreign voucher issuers out of the market, particularly French issuers who had previously dominated that market.\n\n**(2) Discrimination**\n----------------------\n\n363.\n\nWhile Claimant and Respondent discuss \"discrimination,\" neither side seems to offer a clear definition of it.\n\n364.\n\nRespondent argues that a finding of discrimination requires the Tribunal to find discrimination against this Claimant specifically. Under this narrow standard, it is unlikely that discrimination occurred, as nothing in the record points to singling out of Claimant specifically.\n\n365.\n\nClaimant notes that neither the BIT nor the relevant arbitral awards explicitly defines \"discriminatory.\" However, tax measures may not be arbitrary, discriminatory, confiscatory, or abusive. Claimant asks the Tribunal to consider the intent and effect of the tax measure in question when determining whether that measure is discriminatory. An abusive tax measure would be one that is \"crafted to force abandonment of a business enterprise by ruining its economic value, or to provide an investor\u2019s competitors with a beneficial fiscal framework that permits more favorable competition.\"254 According to Claimant, to qualify as an expropriation, a tax measure must also substantially deprive the investor of its use and enjoyment of the investment.255\n\nCl. PHB, para. 17, citing W.W. Park, *Arbitrability and Tax,* in L. Mistelis and S. Brekoulakis (eds.), Arbitrability: International And Comparative Perspectives, 179-205 (2009), Kluwer Law International, paras. 10-21 (CL-0080).\n\nCl. PHB, para. 18.\n\n366.\n\nClaimant and Respondent agree that no definitive requirements exist to determine whether *bona fide* tax reforms are discriminatory. Claimant and Respondent further agree that tax measures may not be illegitimate or abusive. Under the BIT\u2019s provisions regarding expropriation, a state cannot undertake abusive or illegitimate measures that interfere with a distinct property right, and that substantially deprive an investor of the use or control of its investment.256\n\nResp. PHB, para. 62.\n\n367.\n\nRespondent asserts that, generally, a state may adopt *bona fide* measures (1) for the public interest (2) that are non-discriminatory and (3) do not contravene any specific undertaking.257 By Respondent\u2019s reading of relevant prior awards, normal tax policies, practices of revenue generation, or shifting normal fiscal burden have not been likely to result in liability.258 Respondent thus notes a presumption of deference to the state by previous tribunals.259\n\nResp. PHB, para. \u00b661.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 66.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 65.\n\n368.\n\nRespondent argues that if its tax reforms were not *bona fide*, and even if they were discriminatory, these measures would not necessarily equate to expropriation under the BIT or international law.260 To be expropriatory, the measures must have interfered with a distinct property right, and the investor must have been dispossessed of the investment. Respondent asserts that the Tribunal must make a fact-intensive inquiry to determine whether the tax reforms were illegitimate or abusive, and therefore discriminatory.261\n\nResp. PHB, para. 69.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 64.\n\n369.\n\nWithout a clear definition of \"discrimination,\" Respondent argues that the term must be viewed in the context of the PIT reforms.262 In this context, \"discrimination does not mean differentiating between two taxpayers or products,\" since all tax measures necessarily differentiate between taxpayers or products.263 In a situation where a disparate impact falls upon different actors, a claimant will face difficulty demonstrating improper discrimination.264\n\nResp. PHB, para. 41.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 41.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 41, citing United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, *Expropriation a Sequel,* UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II, at 96, UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2011/7, U.N. Sales No. E.12.II.D.7 (2012) (RL-0151). The passage further provides that discrimination covers racial, religious, ethnic and other types of discrimination prohibited under customary international law, but these concerns are not alleged to be at issue here. See also *Link-Trading Joint Stock Company v. Department for Customs Control of the Republic of Moldova,* UNCITRAL, Final Award (April 18, 2002), para. 69 (changes to the annually amended annual budget were not arbitrary or discriminatory because they were of general application and not directed specifically at the claimant) (RL-0021).\n\n370.\n\nClaimant argues that the SZ\u00c9P Decree and subsequent creation of the SZ\u00c9P Card and Ersz\u00e9bet voucher had the effect of creating a new market framework that favored its competitors, to the point that its investments lost their value and it was forced to close SPH. These effects made the reforms discriminatory and abusive.\n\n371.\n\nClaimant points to the CJEU case *Commission v. Hungary,* as did the *Edenred v. Hungary* tribunal, when asserting that the reforms were discriminatory. The CJEU ruled that Erzs\u00e9bet and SZ\u00c9P Card regulations were disproportionate, discriminatory, and not justified by the public interest, and therefore unlawful.265 The CJEU found that the same meal voucher programs considered in this arbitration indirectly discriminated against non-Hungarian EU nationals, thereby violating the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services that are guaranteed by EU law.266\n\nCl. PHB, para. 19.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 20.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges, as Respondent argues, that CJEU proceedings involve different issues than the BIT, and a violation of EU law does not necessarily mean a BIT violation.267 However, since the issues in the CJEU case are substantially related to this one, the Majority of the Tribunal considers the CJEU case as probative in its analysis.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 70.\n\n373.\n\nIn its post-hearing brief, the Tribunal asked Claimant to clarify how Hungary might have permissibly regulated the voucher market. For example, the Tribunal asked whether Hungary could have entirely eliminated the tax benefit granted to hot and cold meal vouchers, or regulated the commissions of employers and affiliates. Claimant replied that Hungary could have lawfully adopted measures that equally affected every voucher issuer. For example, elimination of all tax benefits for meal vouchers, or limiting commission levels, could have been legal regulations. Such hypothetical changes to the voucher system would have been non-discriminatory and had a public purpose that was proportional to Hungary's stated aims.268\n\nCl. PHB, para. 21.\n\n374.\n\nThe Parties dispute the nature and truthfulness of Claimant's claim of discrimination. In its post-hearing brief, Claimant clarified that the gravamen of its claim is that the post-2010 voucher reforms were driven by Hungary's improper intent to replace the French issuers with state-selected issuers. Hungary's subsequent tax reforms were discriminatory and were not justified by a proven public purpose nor proportionate to Hungary's stated goals.269\n\nCl. PHB, para. 22.\n\n375.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant's argument is inconsistent. According to Respondent, Claimant has never explained why it disputes only the challenged reforms but not the 2010 reforms. In Hungary's view, Claimant seems to say that the 2012 measures had a more significant impact, but that the 2010 reforms were not discriminatory. According to Claimant's explanation of the gravamen of its claim, both should have been problematic.270\n\nResp. PHB, paras. 78-85.\n\n376.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that Claimant's assertions of discrimination primarily involve nationality-based discrimination. Respondent notes that the measures at issue applied to all Hungarian taxpayers equally, not just to Claimant or foreign investors. Therefore, Respondent contends the measures cannot be said to discriminate against foreigners.\n\n377.\n\nOn balance, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that the PIT reforms were discriminatory, rendering the expropriation unlawful. Hungary's PIT reforms had the effect of narrowing the entities that could issue the SZ\u00c9P card and Ersz\u00e9bet vouchers, limiting them to state-chosen or state-owned institutions.\n\n378.\n\nHungary offered no satisfying justification for how these reforms achieved a public purpose, or why it was necessary to exclude those issuers who had previously dominated the voucher market. Thus, the Tribunal Majority concludes that Hungary's PIT reforms engaged in expropriation in a discriminatory fashion, with the result of taking property of foreign voucher issuers such as Claimant.\n\n***a. Note on*** **Edenred v. Hungary** ***and*** **UP v. Hungary** ***Awards***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nBefore leaving its analysis of liability, the Majority of the Tribunal would add that its conclusion finds full consistency with the decisions reached in *Edenred v. Hungary* and the *UP v. Hungary* case referred to above, also referred to as *Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner Holding Internationale v. Hungary.*\n\n380.\n\nThese two major arbitrations involve other French voucher issuers. Like those tribunals, the Majority in this arbitration finds that Hungary's PIT reforms unlawfully and indirectly expropriated Claimant's investment.\n\n381.\n\nThis Tribunal did not rely on those two awards in its analysis, but mentions them here only to note in passing that similar conclusions about Hungary's conduct have been adopted elsewhere.\n\n**IX. LEGAL STANDARDS FOR COMPENSATION**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Overview**\n---------------\n\n382.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the BIT sets forth the standard for compensation in expropriations to include \"payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which must equal the real value of the investments concerned on the day prior to the date on which the measures are taken or made public.\" Moreover, such compensation must \"be payable to investors in convertible funds\" and \"be freely transferable.\" Compensation shall be paid \"promptly starting from the date of dispossession, failing which, interest calculated at the applicable market rate shall be charged up to the date of payment.\"\n\n383.\n\nThe BIT does not specify whether this standard applies to lawful expropriations, unlawful expropriations, or both. This lack of specificity appears inconsequential in the current case. Standards of customary international law leads to identical consequences in this case.\n\n384.\n\nIn the absence of a BIT provision on compensation in the case of unlawful expropriation, the Tribunal must look to principles of international law, as provided for in Article 9(3) of the BIT, which states: \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall rule in accordance with the dispositions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\"271\n\nBIT, Article 9(3).\n\n385.\n\nAs elaborated more fully below, under the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle, full reparation should be provided for unlawful acts of states, as far as possible eliminating the consequences of the illegal act and re-establishing the situation which would likely have existed if that act had not been committed.272\n\nCl. Mem., para. 316, citing *Case concerning the Factory at Chorzow,* Merits Judgment No. 13, 13 September 1928, Collection of Judgments: Permanent Court of International Justice, p. 47 (CL-0105); Reply, para. 293.\n\n386.\n\nThis principle is echoed in Article 31 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (Draft Articles),273 as well as Article 34 of the Draft Articles which provides that full reparation can take the form of \"restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination.\"274 These Articles commend themselves as a widely recognized appropriate legal standard of relief.275 Of the forms of full reparation indicated at Article 34 of the Draft Articles, compensation presents itself as appropriate in the present case.\n\nArticle 31 of International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries**,* United Nations (2001) (CL-0049).\n\nMem., para. 317, citing Article 34 of International Law Commission, *Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries**,* United Nations (2001) (CL-0049).\n\n*See*, *e.g.,* *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Award (25 July 2007), para. 87 (CL-0106). *See* also: *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award (12 May 2005), para. 406 (CL-0107).\n\n**B. Valuation Methods**\n------------------------\n\n387.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the BIT incorporates what has sometimes been called the \"Hull formula\" for compensation, requiring prompt, adequate, and effective payment.\n\n388.\n\n\"Adequate\" compensation should be assessed on the fair market value of the expropriated investment.276\n\nWorld Bank Group, *Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,* p. 6, available at http://italaw.com/documents/WorldBank.pdf.\n\n389.\n\nThe BIT\u2019s reference to \"real value\" thus is equivalent to the concept of \"fair market value.\" Fair market value is the estimated amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller on the valuation date, in an arm\u2019s-length transaction after proper marketing, when each of the Parties acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion.\n\n390.\n\nThe valuation date of 31 December 2011, noted by Claimant, constitutes the time when the measures \"first crossed the line and took on their expropriatory character.\" Consequently, Hungary\u2019s measures crystallized into an expropriation on 1 January 2012.277\n\nCl. Mem., para. 323\n\n391.\n\nTo comply with the principle of full compensation, investments with a proven record of profitability, or \"going concerns,\" would be valued on the basis of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methodology. The DCF method involves projecting the future cash flows that the business would have generated but for the host state\u2019s conduct, deducting expected cash expenditures for each year, and then factoring in risks by discounting the resulting net cash flows to the date of valuation. This method yields the present value of an investment\u2019s future cash flows.\n\n392.\n\nGiven that SPH was a going concern active in the Hungarian market from 1993 until its closure, the Tribunal finds that Fair Market Value calculated using Discounted Cash Flow must be the appropriate valuation standard.\n\n**C. Analytic Framework**\n-------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal finds that expropriatory conduct must be considered *en bloc,* not by distinguishing and selecting specific elements of such conduct. The \"but-for\" scenario should assume away the unlawful conduct in its entirety. A but-for scenario should assume away the unlawful conduct without replacing it with hypothetical scenarios resulting from conduct the state could have taken instead of the expropriatory measures.\n\n394.\n\nIn the present case, while the introduction of the New Products cannot *per se* be considered unlawful, such a measure becomes unlawful in light of the tax regime and of the requirements for issuing the New Products. The Tribunal finds it difficult to assume that four new competitors would have entered the market in the absence of the favorable tax treatment.\n\n395.\n\nThe state\u2019s unlawful conduct consists in the introduction not only of a tax regime applicable to the New Products that put Claimant at a competitive disadvantage, but also of rules on the access to the market of the New Products that excluded Claimant and limited access to specific entities related to the state. These measures must also be assumed away as part of the unlawful conduct of the state.\n\n396.\n\nMoreover, had Claimant had access to the market of the New Products, its value might, indeed, have been diminished as a consequence of increased competition. However, Claimant was prevented from entering that market as a consequence of the challenged reforms.\n\n397.\n\nIt is difficult to assume that Claimant would have suffered from the competition of new entrants regardless of the overall regime introduced by the state, including the preferential tax treatment, the creation of the New Products, and new rules restricting the access to the voucher market.\n\n398.\n\nThus, the Majority of the Tribunal accepts the paradigm presented by Claimant (known as \"Claimant\u2019s Framework\" in the Parties\u2019 submissions) for valuation, with quantum determined below. Claimant\u2019s Framework assumes that the entirety of the 2012 PIT reforms, including the introduction of the SZ\u00c9P card and Ersz\u00e9bet vouchers, constituted a breach of the BIT.\n\n399.\n\nBefore proceeding, however, the Majority notes that Article 9(3) of the BIT provides that the arbitral tribunal \"shall rule in accordance with the dispositions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\"278\n\nBIT, Article. 9(3).\n\n400.\n\nIn this connection, the *Chorzow Factory* case, providing a key principle of international law, requires full reparation for unlawful acts of states. Reparation must, as far as possible, \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"279\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 316, citing *Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* Merits Judgment No. 13 (13 September 1928) Collection of Judgments: Permanent Court of International Justice, p. 47 (CL-0105); Cl. Reply, para. 293.\n\n401.\n\nThe *Chorzow Factory* principle has received side recognition as the appropriate legal standard of relief.280 Likewise, compensation presents itself as the appropriate measure of full reparation among the standards evoked by Article 34 of the Draft Articles on Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, compensation is the only appropriate one in the present case.\n\n*See*, *e.g.,* *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Award (25 July 2007), para. 87 (CL-0106). *See* also: *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award (12 May 2005), para. 406 (CL-0107).\n\n**X. QUANTUM OF DAMAGES**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. Heads of Damages and Analytic Framework**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nWhen the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Briefs were filed, Claimant claimed total damages as \u20ac 78,362,495, comprised as follows, as set forth in paragraph 126(2) and footnote 318 of Claimant\u2019s submission of 12 July 2017:\n\n\u2022 \u20ac 75,527,758 as the \"but for\" fair market value (if expropriation had not occurred), calculated pursuant to the discounted cash flow;\n\n\u2022 \u20ac 1,500,000 for restructuring costs\n\n\u2022 \u20ac 1,353,603 in jointly agreed closure costs.\n\n403.\n\nIn passing, the Majority notes that breakdown of Claimant\u2019s quantification may not be self-evident. The three items indicated in footnote 318 add to \u20ac 78,381,361, rather than \u20ac 78,362,495, a difference of \u20ac 18,866. The Tribunal suspects that the difference may derive from a rounding of the restructuring costs.\n\n404.\n\nConsidering the amount claimed as \"but for\" value (\u20ac 75,527,758), plus the Experts\u2019 agreement on the amount of closure costs (\u20ac 1,353,603), the subtotal would come to \u20ac 76,881,361. Subtracting this amount from the total claimed (\u20ac 78,362,495), it can be inferred that amount claimed as restructuring costs would be \u20ac 1,481,134.\n\n405.\n\nThus the Majority\u2019s understanding of the relevant figures yields an amount requested of \u20ac 78,381,361, as totaled in the footnote, rather than the figure indicated in the text which amounts to \u20ac 78,362,495.\n\n406.\n\nFor reasons set forth below, the Majority of the Tribunal finds this figure (\u20ac 78,381,361) to be a reasonable amount to compensate the dispossession of Claimant\u2019s investment, before deduction of SPH\u2019s actual value.\n\n407.\n\nRespondent disagrees with those damages, asserting that if the Tribunal finds that the tax regime breached the BIT, but that the introduction of the SZ\u00c9P Card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher (the \"New Products\") did not, Respondent\u2019s experts calculate damages as \u20ac 19,760,000.\n\n408.\n\nRespondent further asserts that if the Tribunal finds that Claimant is not entitled to compensation for the period after the 2017 Tax Amendment, the amount to which Claimant should be entitled should be further reduced to \u20ac 11,460,000.281\n\nThe sums indicated are those contained in Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. However, in his Second Report, Respondent\u2019s Experts refer to the amount of \u20ac 50,540,000 as the compensation to which Claimant would be entitled under its assumption that the but-for scenario should assume away also the introduction of the New Products.\n\n409.\n\nAs to closure costs, on 3 July 2017, the two sets of experts, [REDACTED]) and [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]), sent to [REDACTED] a letter that was forwarded to the Tribunal, stating that both experts confirm that *\"if* (emphasis added) Claimant is entitled to claim its closure costs, the amount of HUF 425,234,451 or \u20ac 1,353,603 as set out below [in two jointly agreed tables] is reasonable.\"282\n\nLetter of [REDACTED], 3 July 2017.\n\n410.\n\nNotwithstanding the experts\u2019 agreement on the figure, provided only *if* closure costs are to be awarded, the Parties diverge on the entitlement. Claimant argues that the PIT reforms caused closure, while Respondent contends that Claimant had other businesses besides the vouchers and could have stayed open, as did their competitors.\n\n411.\n\nBoth Parties agree that Fair Market Value (FMV), calculated using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, is appropriate if damages are to be awarded.283\n\nCl. Reply, para. 296.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine quantum by considering *inter alia* the following elements: When did the expropriation take place? What is an appropriate valuation date? When did the expropriation end? Is award of closure costs appropriate? Are consequential damages appropriate? What interest rate should be used?\n\n413.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the Parties agree on a number of items, as listed below:\n\n\u2022 that the compensation to which Claimant is entitled should be such to wipe out all the consequences of the unlawful conduct and re-establish the situation which would have likely existed had it not been for that conduct (full compensation);284\n\n\u2022 that Fair Market Value (FMV), calculated using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, is appropriate if damages are to be awarded;285\n\n\u2022 that the appropriate methodology to evaluate the investment is the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) as it is appropriate to evaluate a going concern such as SPH and it encompasses regulatory risk inherent to the iterative nature of tax policies;\n\n\u2022 that the appropriate measure of compensation is: i) the hypothetical value of SPH as of the Valuation Date (assuming the absence of the expropriatory measures) minus ii) the actual value of SPH after the unlawful measures;286\n\n\u2022 that 31 December 2011 would be an appropriate Valuation Date;\n\n\u2022 that the \"but-for\" value is the value of SPH before the alleged breach and the \"actual value\" is the value of SPH after the alleged breach.287\n\nClaimant states that Article 5.2 of the BIT provides the standard for compensation for lawful expropriation but not for unlawful expropriation. Respondent contends that the standard of compensation of Article 5.2 of the BIT applies regardless of the lawful or unlawful nature of the expropriation. However, it is unclear what consequences the parties draw from this difference in approach. After relying on Article 5.2 of the BIT, Respondent turns immediately to discussing (and contesting) Claimant\u2019s valuation based on the full compensation standard *(see* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 227-234).\n\nCl. Reply, para. 296.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 110.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, para. 82.\n\n**B. The Parties\u2019 Frameworks**\n------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Parties disagree over whether the introduction of the New Products can be separated from the tax regime.\n\n415.\n\nClaimant contends that the introduction of the New Products cannot be separated from their tax regime. Hungary\u2019s conduct must be taken as a whole. The drafters of the reform themselves considered the introduction of the New Products and their tax advantages as a package.288 It would be speculative to assume what measures Hungary would have taken in the absence of the expropriatory measures, notably whether Hungary would have introduced the New Products even without their tax advantages.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, para. 78.\n\n416.\n\nClaimant further argues that no evidence supports the idea that the SZ\u00c9P cards and Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers would have been able to enter the voucher market in the absence of the preferential tax treatment. No player had ever been able to gain a meaningful market share without being granted a preferential tax treatment.289 The entities that entered the market after the reform had not done so before and did so precisely because of the favorable tax regime they could enjoy. Given the strong position of the three French issuers, it would have been impossible for competitors to enter the market and gain market share without the discriminatory tax regime.\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, paras. 2.26-2.27.\n\n417.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant attests that no evidence exists that Hungary considered introducing the vouchers with equal tax treatment.290 The SZ\u00c9P cards and Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers were consistently discussed by Hungarian politicians only in the context of the PIT reforms, or in the context of an overall plan to reform the voucher market.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, para. 77.\n\n418.\n\nClaimant argues that [REDACTED], Respondent\u2019s experts, provide purely speculative projections of the effect that these new products would have had on SPH\u2019s bottom line291 While valuation is not an exact science, Claimants argue that appropriate valuation cannot rest on such speculation.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, para. 79.\n\n419.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert [REDACTED] computes the expected free cash flows after-tax over the forecast period of SPH\u2019s 2011 Business Plan on the basis of the EBIT projections, depreciation, and amortization and capital expenditure projections therein.292 He adjusts the Business Plan to carve out the value of SPH\u2019s remaining International Production activity, which was unaffected by the PIT reforms. He then assesses the terminal value of future cash flows into perpetuity, discounting them at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as of 31 December 2011, of 13%.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 343\n\n420.\n\nClaimant's expert had determined that a market approach to valuation was inappropriate due to lack of publicly available figures on comparable competitors to SPH. However, he cross-checked his valuation against historical Enterprise Value multiples for Edenred SA, the only comparable public company in the Hungarian meal voucher market. Claimant's expert noted that Edenred is a global group, unlike SPH, and therefore does not form an ideal basis for the use of the market approach to valuation. As a cross-check, however, he determined that Edenred's multiples were higher, suggesting that his valuation of SPH is conservative.293\n\nCl. Mem., para. 343\n\n421.\n\nClaimant's expert determined that SPH's other non-voucher business lines were marginal and could not sustain SPH alone, so he did not further specify deductions from the valuation for these businesses, other than an \"Other Income\" line.294\n\nCl. Mem., para. 344.\n\n422.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant's claim relates to the tax regime introduced by the reforms, absent which there would be no arguable claim. It argues that the allegedly unlawful tax regime of the New Products can be dissociated from their introduction (which cannot be considered unlawful). Even without considering the tax advantages, the mere introduction of such products would have resulted in increased competition and in a corresponding reduction of Claimant's market share.\n\n423.\n\nFurther, Respondent argues that the but for valuation of SPH must consider a scenario on which SPH's voucher products are competing with the SZ\u00c9P cards and Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers, with all voucher products being taxed equally. Respondent says that the SZ\u00c9P cards and Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers would have been able to enter the market and acquire market share without preferential tax treatment. Respondent asserts that the New Products would be competitive and attractive to consumers because of the SZ\u00c9P cards' commission structure, the Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers' charitable purpose, the pre-existing corporate and merchant relationships of the SZ\u00c9P issuers and the MN\u00dcA that would facilitate the creation of client and affiliate networks, and trends supporting the transition to electronic payments in Hungary that would favor SZ\u00c9P.295\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, paras. 46-64.\n\n424.\n\nBecause of these differences, Claimant and Respondent present two different \"Frameworks\" for the Tribunal to evaluate when conducting valuation.\n\n425.\n\nThe \"Claimant\u2019s Framework\" presents a \"but for\" scenario that assumes away the PIT reforms and the New Products in their entirety. According to this framework, but for the PIT reforms, which granted the New Products an inherent competitive advantage, the New Products could not have gained any material market share in the established meal voucher market.\n\n426.\n\nThe \"Respondent\u2019s Framework\" presents a scenario that assumes away only the differential tax component of the 2012 reforms while incorporating the New Products into the market. Respondent argues that only the alleged expropriatory breaches should be assumed away, but not the introduction of the new products. The introduction of the New Products should be assumed in the but for scenario, but without the preferential tax treatment relative to SPH\u2019s products.\n\n427.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal finds Claimant\u2019s \"but for\" scenario more compelling. In making its evaluation, the Majority must assume away the PIT reforms and the New Products in their entirety. But for the PIT reforms, which granted the New Products an inherent competitive advantage, the New Products could not have gained any material market share in the established meal voucher market.\n\n**C. Commission Rates**\n-----------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Parties also differ regarding appropriate commission rates to be applied. Claimant assumes economic growth, since at the time of the reform, Hungary was coming out of a recession. Claimant thus assumes increased employment and higher volumes of commissions. Even if commission rates fell, Claimant argues that this would be compensated by increased sales volumes. Moreover, Claimant's Expert notes that, despite the increase in voucher taxation in 2010, 2011 and 2012, vouchers remained more favorably taxed than salary. Therefore, market contraction should not be assumed. Claimant's expert further assumes stable commission rates.\n\n429.\n\nIn Claimant's 2011 Business Plan, client commissions are flat at 2% over the period. Claimant's expert characterizes this forecast as based on \"conservative\" assumptions.296 Claimant's expert relies on Management's assumption that client commissions would remain stable at 2% of BVI from FY11 going forward, and that affiliate commissions would decrease from 3.5% of BVI in FY11 to 3.1% of BVI in FY14 and remain stable thereafter.297 Claimant's expert notes that BVI and commission rates are intertwined because commission revenue is driven by BVI and the commission rate.298 Claimant's expert further notes that the commission rate is consistent with the competition because it corresponds to Erzs\u00e9bet's commission rate.299\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, paras. 4.16, 4.32\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 4.3\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 4.11\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 4.11\n\n430.\n\nHowever, Claimant's 2010-2013 Strategic Plan notes a falling trend in client commissions prior to 2010.300\n\nExhibit R-0081, Slide 31.\n\n431.\n\nRespondent assumes market contraction resulting from removal of the preferential tax treatment of vouchers as from 2010 (*i.e.* two years prior to the valuation date) and reduced personal income tax burden on salaries (which increases the relative attractiveness of salary compensation). Respondent's experts, [REDACTED], further assumes reduction of Claimant's commission from 2% to 1.5 % in the period 2012-2016 on the basis of historic trends.\n\n432.\n\nRespondent argues that client and affiliate commissions are distinct revenue streams, arising from two different stakeholders, and should be considered separately when modeling SPH\u2019s commission revenue.301\n\n[REDACTED]Second Expert Report, paras. 119-131\n\n433.\n\nRespondent asserts that SPH\u2019s client commissions had been declining for several years before the valuation date, and that BP11 ignores trends in client commissions. Respondent further asserts that SPH\u2019s competitors expected downward pressure on client commission rates.302\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, para. 129.\n\n434.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 projection of market contraction is flawed due to reliance on improper or outdated data and assumptions about market conditions, and because Respondent did not consider Hungary\u2019s improving economic circumstances.303\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 119, 121. Claimant further notes Respondent relied on SPH\u2019s 2009 strategic plan, and at the hearing, Respondent\u2019s experts chose to rely on SPH\u2019s 2010 Strategic Plan and the market risks therein, ignoring the 2011 strategic plan, and therefore the impact of the 2011 reform on perceived risk. Cl. PHB, para. 122.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no reason to assume that the voucher market would contract.\n\n436.\n\nGeneral economic trends and Hungary-specific economic indicators show that in the post-2012 period no market contraction could be anticipated.\n\n437.\n\nMoreover, the reforms undertaken by Hungary since 2010 show the intention was to sustain and expand the vouchers system, not to challenge it. Therefore, the Majority of the Tribunal does not find it appropriate to assume market contraction.\n\n438.\n\nNothing in the Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 report seems to support the existence of a trend towards a decrease of commission rates. In any case, even assuming such a trend, this would be compensated by market growth.\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimant\u2019s expert\u2019s figures for commission revenues can therefore be considered accurate.\n\n**D. Discount Rate**\n--------------------\n\n440.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert assumes a 13% discount rate. This rate considers market instability and country risk. Claimant\u2019s expert states that no additional risk should be imputed to market instability because a notional buyer would not have considered the risk of the government granting a competitive advantage to a new entrant.\n\n441.\n\nRespondent\u2019s experts generally agree with the Claimant\u2019s expert\u2019s approach to calculating the discount rate. However, Respondent\u2019s experts add a 2% discount for market instability, including additional risk and uncertainty as to the future tax treatment of vouchers in the wake of the 2010 and 2011 reforms.304 This would mean a 15% discount.\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, para. 148\n\n442.\n\nApplying \"Respondent\u2019s Framework\" for damages, discussed above, Respondent\u2019s experts had added a 1% discount for country risk, amounting to a total discount rate of 16%. This view takes into consideration higher volatility deriving from the entry of four new competitors into the market, and the risk of market contraction from increased tax rates for vouchers. Because the Majority has already rejected \"Respondent\u2019s Framework,\" as discussed above, it also rejects adding a corresponding 1% to the discount rate.\n\n443.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 calculation of an additional 2% premium is flawed because the experts themselves admitted that the \"number was neither substantiated with reference to any report nor based on any mathematical calculation.\"305 Claimant asserts that its expert\u2019s 13% discount rate already includes an appropriate country risk premium accounting for market-specific risk.306\n\nCl. PHB, para. 120, citing Tr. Day 3, 723:5-724:9 ([REDACTED] Cross-Examination).\n\nCl. PHB, para. 120, citing [REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 4.76\n\n444.\n\nThe Tribunal finds a 13% discount rate to be appropriate.\n\n445.\n\nWhen SPH made its Strategic Plan for 2010-2013, it could not have known that Hungary\u2019s PIT reforms would occur. However, it accounted for uncertainty relating to the election of the new Fidesz government. SPH\u2019s 2010-2013 Strategic Plan is dated 14-16 April 2010.307 The plan notes some political uncertainty because Fidesz won the first round of parliamentary elections on 11 April 2010, and the second round of elections were to be held on 25 April 2010.308 The plan notes that no concrete messaging had been done on the meal voucher topic, and that changing the voucher framework positively might actually be good for Fidesz.309\n\nExhibit R-0081, SPH's Strategic Plan 2010-2013 (14-16 April 2010).\n\nExhibit R-0081, Slide 7.\n\nId.\n\n446.\n\nWhile the risk to the meal voucher framework based on the Fidesz election thus remained unclear, the plan does note that the \"Position of FIDESZ government after election will be decisive.\"310 The Strategic Plan thus anticipates that additional reforms might occur.\n\nId., at 18.\n\n447.\n\nThe 2010-2013 Strategic Plan anticipated that food and meal vouchers might be separated and risks in sustainability and business might result.311 The 2010-2013 Strategic plan also discusses the PIT reforms that the government had previously introduced and their effects on the voucher market. The Strategic Plan thus assumes increased market instability specific to the voucher market.\n\nId., Slide 9.\n\n448.\n\nSPH\u2019s Strategic Plan 2010-2013, together with its Budget Plan, thus represent a realistic scenario of what a notional buyer would have considered when determining whether to buy SPH, assuming away the reforms. Without the reforms, the market uncertainty due to the 2010-2011 reforms which caused Respondent to raise the discount rate would not have existed.\n\n449.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal finds that Claimant\u2019s expert adequately considered the potential increased volatility of the legal environment when calculating a discount rate that accounted for market risk.\n\n450.\n\nThus, the Majority of the Tribunal finds that it would be inappropriate to increase the discount rate by another 2% to account for market uncertainty that would not have existed but for the PIT reforms.\n\n**E. Value of SPH, Including Residual Value of Product Lines**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert calculates SPH\u2019s actual value after expropriation to be zero, while Respondent\u2019s experts assert that SPH has some value, given that SPH had other, non-meal voucher lines of business which were not impacted by the expropriation. In Respondent\u2019s view, these other lines could be expected to grow in the future, according to SPH\u2019s 2011 Business Plan (\"BP2011\").312\n\nResp. C-Mem., paras. 253-54.\n\n452.\n\nRespondent says it remains unable to provide an alternative figure for SPH\u2019s value because Claimant\u2019s expert did not analyze data regarding SPH\u2019s other product lines. However, Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 first report and Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial calculated SPH\u2019s actual value to be \u20ac 6.69 million.313\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 255; [REDACTED] First Expert Report, paras. 191-192.\n\n453.\n\nIn their second report, Respondent\u2019s experts calculated SPH\u2019s actual value to be \u20ac 7.58 million, based on SPH\u2019s BP2011 which was prepared in May 2011 and taking into account the improved financial performance of the non-meal voucher lines of business after elimination of the meal voucher activities.314\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, paras. 177-178.\n\n454.\n\nIn the \"Joint Quantum Experts Statement Summarizing Areas of Agreement & Disagreement\" (\"Joint Statement\"), sent by Claimant on 31 March 2017, and in its Presentation on Valuation and Damages at the hearing (slides 24 and 27), Respondent\u2019s experts further revised SPH\u2019s actual value to be \u20ac 5.5 million. [REDACTED] presented this figure in slide 24 of its \"Presentation on Valuation & Damages\" at the hearing, which calculated the Actual Value of SPH as of 31 December 2011 on an \"Ex-Ante Basis\" taking into account all facts and circumstances known on the date of the breach.\n\n455.\n\nClaimant states that [REDACTED]'s assessment of SPH's \"actual value\" captures the value at the moment that the expropriatory measures first crystallized into an expropriation, ignoring the subsequent measures.315\n\nCl. PHB, para. 125.\n\n456.\n\nClaimant and Respondent further disagree on whether the 2017 Tax Reforms, which eliminated preferential tax treatment for the SZ\u00c9P and Ersz\u00e9bet vouchers, should impact damages.\n\n457.\n\nClaimant argues that SPH was permanently deprived of its leading position on the fringe benefit market. The 2017 Tax Reform does not allow SPH to compete on an even playing field with SZ\u00c9P card issuers. SPH will not be able to regain market share from SZ\u00c9P issuers, having been permanently deprived of the value of its business to the point of needing to close. It is unlikely that SPH would be able to get back clients it lost as a result of the discriminatory measures that were in place for five years.\n\n458.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant's loss is not permanent. Because of the 2017 reforms, Respondent believes damages should be limited to lost profits suffered during the period 2012-2016.316 Respondent asserts that the 2017 tax reforms now enable SPH to compete with the SZ\u00c9P card and Ersz\u00e9bet vouchers on an even playing field. According to Respondent, the reforms could have enabled SPH to re-enter the market, like its competitor Edenred. Because SPH can also re-enter the market, SPH's Actual Value may be positive in the future.317\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, paras. 160-170.\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, paras. 160-170.\n\n459.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert concedes that Claimant\u2019s International Production business was not part of Claimant\u2019s core business and was not directly impacted by the PIT reforms.318\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 5.15.\n\n460.\n\nOther than the International Production Business, Claimant\u2019s expert includes all business lines in his analysis. Claimant asserts that the value of its I&R business lines and Cafeteria services were included in its expert\u2019s \"Other Revenues\" line, and thus were factored into the but for and actual values of SPH.319\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 5.7. Cl. Reply, para. 324.\n\n461.\n\nRespondent argues that the value of the un-impacted business lines must be included in the valuation of SPH in the \"but-for\" and actual scenarios. Both International Production and other non-voucher operations were not impacted by the alleged breaches, according to Respondent, and therefore must be included in the valuation of SPH.320 This affects Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim because the other businesses of SPI in Hungary have an actual value greater than zero.\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, para. 189.\n\n462.\n\nClaimant and Respondent disagree on the EBIT forecasts for the Cafeteria and I&R Services business lines. Claimant asserts that EBIT margins will not continue to improve.321 Respondent argues that EBIT margins will continue to improve, reaching 35% and 44.2% in FY16 for Cafeteria and I&R Services, respectively, based on SPH\u2019s 2011 Business Plan\u2019s Cafeteria EBIT of 29% and I&R EBIT of 35% in FY14.322\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 5.31\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, Appendix D.1e\u2014Updated.\n\n463.\n\nClaimant argues that its I&R and Cafeteria businesses are small and only viable as add-ons to its core businesses and that Respondent\u2019s experts rely on a cost allocation by business line that was prepared only for analytical purposes.323\n\n[REDACTED] Rebuttal Expert Report, paras. 5.33 and 5.52.\n\n464.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant has not adequately considered the value of its Cafeteria, I&R, and International Production businesses in its valuation calculations.\n\n465.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant\u2019s expert has not demonstrated that the Cafeteria, I&R, and International Production business are unprofitable on their own. The 2011 Business Plan indicates that SPH had plans to grow the Cafeteria and I&R lines quickly in the following years.324 Trends suggest that SPH would be profitable by 2019 and could be profitable even without the losses from the meal voucher business.325\n\n[REDACTED] First Expert Report, para. 163.\n\n[REDACTED] First Expert Report, para. 163; [REDACTED] Second Expert Report, para. 165.\n\n466.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that some value must be imputed to SPH after expropriation.\n\n467.\n\nThe Tribunal does not question SPI\u2019s decision to close operations in Hungary. Claimant has persuasively demonstrated that, after the PIT reforms, SPH had been operating at a loss for several years and that the non-meal voucher lines of business were only ancillary to its core business, *i.e.* the meal voucher activity. The Tribunal has been persuaded that SPH\u2019s non-voucher business lines were not viable as stand-alone businesses.\n\n468.\n\nAlso, the Majority of the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent\u2019s argument that the 2016 Tax Reforms would have allowed Claimant to re-enter the market on a level playing field with its competitors. Claimant has plausibly argued that SPH was permanently deprived of the value of its business. The Tribunal finds it unlikely that SPH would have been able to get back clients that it lost as a result of the PIT reforms that had been in place since 2011, and Respondent has not presented any plausible argument to the contrary.\n\n469.\n\nHowever, it is undisputed that the non-meal voucher lines of business (Cafeteria, I&R and International Production) were unaffected by the PIT reforms. Respondent has plausibly argued, and the BP 2011 confirms, that, in 2011, SPH intended to diversify its business and anticipated growth for its non-voucher lines of business. The fact that these lines of business were not viable as stand-alone activities in SPH\u2019s organization and business case, does not mean that a notional buyer would not have been prepared to buy them.\n\n470.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert indicated SPH\u2019s actual value to be zero and did not put forward any alternative valuation. As mentioned, Respondent\u2019s experts have changed their position twice in this respect. In their first report, they indicated SPH\u2019s actual value to be \u20ac 6.69 million, in their second report \u20ac 7.58 million, and in Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 Presentation on Valuation and Damages at the hearing \u20ac 5.5 million.\n\n471.\n\nRespondent\u2019s experts\u2019 valuation in their first report326 refers only to the business lines that were unimpacted by the PIT Reforms and is based on the financial performance of these lines projected in the BP2011. The Tribunal considers the BP2011 as a reliable basis since it was prepared by Claimant itself at a date reasonably close to the Valuation Date.\n\n[REDACTED] First Expert Report, para. 189, and Appendix D.\n\n472.\n\nRespondent\u2019s experts corrected and increased SPH\u2019s actual value in their second report,327 which is based on the improved financial performance the non-meal voucher lines of business would project after the meal-voucher activities were eliminated.\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Report, para. 177 and Appendix D.1e - Updated.\n\n473.\n\nIn their Presentation on Valuation and Damages at the hearing and in the Joint Statement, Respondent\u2019s experts further corrected and decreased SPH\u2019s actual value to be \u20ac 5.5 million.328 Respondent\u2019s experts explained this correction by reference to the need to take into account the costs of restructuring and downsizing SPH after elimination of the meal voucher line of business. Although Respondent\u2019s experts did not present a detailed analysis of the impact of the restructuring costs, the Majority of the Tribunal has been persuaded that their valuation is reasonable and accepts it.\n\nTr., Day 3, pp. 644 and 775-776; [REDACTED] Presentation at Hearing, slide 24.\n\n474.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore retain Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 last valuation and deduct \u20ac 5.5 million from the amount awarded to Claimant.\n\n**F. Closure Costs**\n--------------------\n\n475.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties\u2019 experts have agreed that *\"if* (emphasis added) Claimant is entitled to claim its closure costs, the amount of HUF 425,234,451 or \u20ac 1,353,603 is reasonable.\"329\n\nLetter of [REDACTED], 3 July 2017.\n\n476.\n\nNotwithstanding the experts\u2019 agreement on the figure, provided only *if* closure costs are to be awarded, the Parties diverge on the entitlement, as discussed below.\n\n477.\n\nClaimant argues that the PIT reforms caused SPH to lose its ability to generate profit and ultimately, to close. Claimant cites SPH\u2019s EBIT figures, which have been consistently negative since 2013. Claimant adds that its non-voucher business lines were never intended to be sustained as stand-alone businesses.330 Therefore, the closure of the voucher activity because of the reforms necessitated the closing of all business in Hungary.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 123.\n\n478.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant has not demonstrated that SPH\u2019s business is permanently unviable. First, Respondent contends that SPH had other business besides the vouchers and could have stayed open, as did their competitors. Claimant has other lines of business in Hungary, which were unaffected by the challenged reforms. Claimant has not demonstrated that these other lines of business could not have generated revenues.\n\n479.\n\nMoreover, as a consequence of the CJEU decision, Respondent has amended the laws challenged by Claimant. Respondent argues that Claimant\u2019s meal vouchers will now receive the same tax treatment as the Erszebet Voucher. Therefore, Claimant will be granted full reparation in the form of restitution in-kind, and any compensation by arbitral award would result in double recovery.\n\n480.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that, given the legislative change, Claimant could have re-established its voucher operations in Hungary. Therefore, it is entitled to compensation only for the period 2012-2016. Since the decision to close all operations in Hungary was Claimant\u2019s decision, Claimant is not entitled to closure costs.\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal finds an award of closure costs to Claimant appropriate, in the amount of \u20ac 1,353,603 agreed upon jointly by both Parties\u2019 experts. The closure costs are a consequence of the expropriatory measures. Claimant is therefore entitled to recover them.\n\n482.\n\nClaimant has successfully demonstrated that SPH has lost its capacity to generate business, and that the value of its business was destroyed. Since the meal vouchers made up the vast majority of its business, Claimant\u2019s decision to close operations in Hungary cannot be questioned.\n\n483.\n\nIt is undisputed that, as of 2017, to comply with the CJEU decision, Hungary introduced the same tax treatment for meal vouchers and the Erszebet Voucher. However, this change in the tax regime does not wipe out the consequences of the expropriation and the prejudice suffered by Claimant before the adoption of the 2017 measures. Therefore, it cannot be considered restitution in-kind.\n\n484.\n\nThe 2017 changes to Hungary\u2019s tax regime also do not prevent Claimant from projecting lost profit in perpetuity. The effects of expropriation were sufficiently stable that the loss can be considered permanent.\n\n485.\n\nMoreover, at the time of the expropriation, Claimant could not have known that, after several years, Hungary would be forced to change the tax framework to give Claimant\u2019s vouchers an equal tax treatment to the Erszebet voucher. Claimant could not have been expected to make business decisions based on the hope that Hungary would make such a change, and Claimant cannot expect that such a change will be permanent.\n\n486.\n\nHowever, even if the expropriation caused the closing of all business in Hungary, the fact that Claimant had other lines of business unaffected by the challenged measures means that a notional buyer would have imputed some value to SPH.\n\n**G. CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES**\n----------------------------\n\n487.\n\nIt is unclear whether Claimant seeks consequential damages separate from closure costs.\n\n488.\n\nIn its Memorial on the Merits, Claimants initially sought downsizing costs for redundancies and excess rental costs. According to Claimant, these damages are not covered by fair market valuation of SPH because they were incurred after the valuation date and are not included in projected cash flows.331\n\nCl. Mem., para. 332.\n\n489.\n\nIn its Reply on the Merits, Claimant\u2019s expert appears to fold consequential damages into closure costs, accounting for the fact that by the time of the Reply, Claimant had closed its Hungarian business. Claimant\u2019s new calculation of closure costs includes redundancy costs (HUF 350 million), termination of long-term contracts (HUF 28 million), and miscellaneous costs (HUF 3.5 million). After these new calculations, Claimant\u2019s expert arrives at a quantum of the total compensation due to Claimant: HUF 23.8 billion, or EUR 78.2 million.332\n\nCl. Reply, paras. 329-330.\n\n490.\n\nAt the time it filed its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant no longer included a separate head of damages for consequential damages. It sought only to receive the \"but-for\" fair market value of SPH, restructuring costs, and jointly-agreed closure costs.\n\n491.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant has not proven the alleged losses nor shown that the costs were proximate and foreseeable. According to Respondent, Claimant\u2019s only support for these damages is an appendix to [REDACTED] Report citing only SPH Management.333 SPH\u2019s closure costs are speculative because they have not yet been incurred.334\n\nRespondent\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, at para. 89.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, para. 89.\n\n492.\n\nThe additional consequential damages that Claimant sought in its original Memorial on the Merits appear to have been subsumed within its request for closure costs. Since Claimant\u2019s Memorial and Reply were filed, the experts have agreed on joint calculations of closure costs. Thus, the Tribunal declines to award consequential damages on top of closure costs.\n\n**H. Interest**\n---------------\n\n493.\n\nClaimant argues that pre-award interest should accrue from the agreed-upon valuation date of 31 December 2011 to the date of the final award, and that post-award interest should accrue from the date of the final award to the date of full payment of the principal sum.335\n\nCl. Mem., at para. 336\n\n494.\n\nAccording to Claimant, a 12-month EURIBOR rate + 1.75%, compounded annually should be the rate to be applied.336\n\nClaimant\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, at para. 86\n\n495.\n\nClaimant notes that EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) represents a widely accepted reference for setting interest rates in Europe.\n\n496.\n\nThe spread from EURIBOR is an average applied to intercompany loans within the Sodexo Group between 2011 and August 2015, on an annual basis, fixed for transfer pricing documentation to ensure that these are aligned to market levels over the period.337\n\nCl. Mem., para. 337\n\n497.\n\nClaimant asserts that interest should be compounded annually, as the rates on intercompany loans are reviewed on an annual basis within the Sodexo Group, reflecting current practice in arbitration and modern economic realities.338\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 338-339\n\n498.\n\nRespondent does not contest Claimant\u2019s arguments regarding interest.\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the above analysis reasonable, and adopts the proposed approach in this Award.\n\n500.\n\nPre-award and post-award interest reflect the time value of money, with post-award interest compensating additional loss incurred from the date of the award to the date of final payment, a principle recognized in international arbitration law and practice.\n\n501.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the BIT requires the payment of interest \"at an appropriate commercial rate\" on the principal sum awarded. This is consistent with the well-established principle of international law that interest forms a fundamental component of full compensation.\n\n502.\n\nThe Tribunal awards pre-and post-award interest compounded annually at the 12-month EURIBOR rate plus 1.75%, running from 31 December 2011 to the date of full payment of the principal sum.339\n\nClaimant\u2019s Pre-Hearing Skeleton, at para. 336\n\n**XI. majority observations on separate opinion OF MR. THOMAS**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nThe Majority has carefully considered the Separate Opinion of our esteemed colleague Christopher Thomas.\n\n504.\n\nThe Majority agrees with Mr. Thomas that this Tribunal has power to find liability and damages in respect of a dispossession in the sense provided in Article 5(2) of the BIT and arbitrators must respect the shared intent of the Contracting States.\n\n505.\n\nIn the separate and dissenting opinion, Mr. Thomas states that \"I do not think that the discrimination, disproportionality, etc. of the measures gets the Tribunal home on expropriation.\"\n\n506.\n\nFor the sake of good order and the integrity of this Award, the Majority must note that it did not base its finding of indirect expropriation on discrimination or disproportionality *per se,* but rather determined first that an indirect expropriation occurred because the value of the shares was effectively reduced to zero through the PIT reforms.\n\n507.\n\nFollowing its determination of expropriation, the Majority engaged in a discussion of discrimination, to show that the PIT reforms were not *bona fide* regulatory measures, and that the expropriation was unlawful. The majority conducted that analysis according to well-established criteria for determining what regulatory measure prove *bona fide,* and when expropriation proves unlawful.\n\n508.\n\nIt bears repeating that the Majority determined that an unlawful expropriation occurred, *not* that autonomous grounds for recovery exist by virtue of discrimination, disproportionality and unfair treatment *qua* discrimination, disproportionality and unfair treatment.\n\n509.\n\nBecause the Majority of the Tribunal finds that Hungary's behaviour constitutes an unlawful expropriation, the Majority finds it unnecessary to analyse whether Hungary's behaviour separately constitutes a dispossession to which Article 5(2) of the BIT refers, assuming that the notion of \"dispossession\" bears the separate and broader meaning suggested by Mr. Thomas.\n\n510.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal need take no position on whether in the abstract the term \"dispossession\" in Article 5(2) of the BIT creates a separate and broader category from expropriations and nationalizations and is (as suggested by Mr. Thomas \"intended to reach measures that are not expropriations or nationalizations (either direct or indirect)\".340\n\nSeparate Opinion of Christopher Thomas, paras. 57-58.\n\n**XII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n511.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention empowers the Tribunal to assess the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with the proceedings, and apportion such expenses, as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the expenses and charges of the Secretariat, between the Parties.\n\n512.\n\nIn determining how costs shall be apportioned, Procedural Order No. 1 states that \"the Tribunal may assess the reasonableness and proportionality of costs claimed and take into account factors it considers relevant, including the procedural conduct of the Parties and/or their counsel throughout the proceedings. Cost items that may be recoverable include but are not limited to arbitration costs (arbitrators\u2019 fees and ICSID\u2019s administrative costs), lawyers\u2019 fees, and experts\u2019 costs.\"341\n\nProcedural Order no. 1, para. 9.2\n\n513.\n\nOn 17 October 2017, each side submitted its request on costs (legal representation and ICSID costs), which for Claimant totaled \u20ac 4,808,859.12 plus USD 325,000 (with interest compounded annually at the 12-month Euro Interbank Offered (EURIBOR) plus 1.75% from the date of the Award until final payment. For Respondent the analogous amount came to USD 2,345,427.95.\n\n514.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal\u2019s Assistant, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses |  |\n| William W. Park | 220,573.91 |\n| Andrea Carlevaris | 201,243.56 |\n| John Christopher Thomas | 124,391.76 |\n| Jill Goldenziel | 58,420.00 |\n| ICSID\u2019s administrative fees | 138,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 48,584.36 |\n| **Total** | **791,213.59** |\n\n515.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in the amount of 799,855.00.342 The Parties individual shares of the costs of arbitration amount to USD 395,606.79 for SPI and USD 395,606.80 for Hungary.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal consider that neither side has pursued the claims and/or defenses in bad faith. Difficult questions arose which the arbitrators debated vigorously, and which continued to divide the Tribunal until a common decision was reached on the result, if not the reasoning.\n\n517.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that each side should bear its own costs of legal representation and should bear on a 50/50 basis the costs of the arbitration paid to and through ICSID.\n\n**XIII. DISPOSITION**\n---------------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal decides as follows:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThrough unlawful dispossession of Claimant\u2019s investment in Hungary, Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 5(2) of the Treaty between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic of Hungary Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 30 September 1987.\n\n519.\n\nIn consequence, Claimants are entitled to damages in a principal amount equal to [REDACTED]\n\n520.\n\nInterest shall accrue compounded annually at the 12-month EURIBOR rate plus 1.75%, running from 31 December 2011 to the date of full payment of the principal sum.343\n\nCl. Mem., at para. 336\n\n521.\n\nEach side shall bear its own legal expenses, including fees for attorneys and experts.\n\n522.\n\nThe costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators and the administrative expenses of the Centre, shall be divided on an equal (50/50) basis.\n\n523.\n\nAny and all other claims heard before the Tribunal are hereby dismissed.\n\nDate: 10 January 2019"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2020-02-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn May 27, 2019, Hungary (the \u201c**Applicant**\u201d or the \u201c**Respondent**\u201d) filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u201c**ICSID**\u201d or the \u201c**Centre**\u201d) an Application for Annulment (the \u201c**Application for Annulment**\u201d) of the award rendered on January 28, 2019 (the \u201c**Award**\u201d). In its Application for Annulment, Hungary requested a stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States dated March 18, 1965 (the \u201c**ICSID Convention**\u201d).\n\n2.\n\nOn May 31, 2019, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Application for Annulment and transmitted a Notice of Registration to the Parties on the same date. In that Notice, the Secretary-General noted that the Application for Annulment contained a request for a stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \u201c**Arbitration Rules**\u201d). The Secretary-General notified the Parties that, pursuant to Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n3.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee (the \u201c**Committee**\u201d) was constituted on July 30, 2019 in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. Its members are Mr. Andr\u00e9s Jana Linetzky (Chilean), serving as President, Dr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu (British/Nigerian); and Dr. Jacomijn van Haersolte-van Hof (Dutch).\n\n4.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 was issued on September 6, 2019, and provided, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006.\n\n5.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, on September 27, 2019, Hungary filed a Submission in Support of Hungary's Application for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Exhibits R-81 through R-84 and Legal Authorities RLA-162 through RLA-178 (the \u201c**Application for Continued Stay**\u201d).\n\n6.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, Sodexo Pass International SAS (\u201c**Sodexo**\u201d or the \u201c**Claimant**\u201d) filed its Response to the Applicant\u2019s Request for the Continued Stay, together with Exhibits C-96 through C-103 and Legal Authorities CL-158 through CL-171 (the \u201c**Response**\u201d).\n\n7.\n\nOn November 8, 2019, Hungary filed a Reply on its Request for the Continued Stay, together with Legal Authorities RLA-179 through RLA-193 (the \u201c**Reply**\u201d).\n\n8.\n\nOn November 29, 2019, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Hungary\u2019s Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement, together with Exhibits C-104 through C-106 and Legal Authorities CL-172 and CL-173 (the \u201c**Rejoinder**\u201d).\n\n**II.

In its view, in as much as Sodexo has a right to seek enforcement of the Award, Hungary also has a right to seek that any enforcement of the same be stayed.8\n\nReply, paras.10-15.\n\n**(3) Hungary has Satisfied the Burden of Proof**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nWith respect to Sodexo's contention that Hungary attempted to \u201cshift the burden of proof,\u201d Hungary contends that it has never argued that the stay of enforcement should be granted automatically in each case.9 Rather, Hungary argues that ICSID practice is that *ad hoc* committees overwhelmingly grant applications for stay of enforcement absent unusual circumstances. Hungary further contends that, while an applicant is required to specify the circumstances justifying the stay of enforcement, at the same time, the other party is required to substantiate the \u201cpositive allegations\u201d for rebutting the applicant's request.10\n\nReply, para. 17.\n\nReply, para. 19, citing *Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v.

Hungary's Application for Annulment was in Good Faith***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nHungary argues that a number of *ad hoc* committees have considered that \u201cabsent any evidence that the application for annulment of the Award is purely dilatory or vexatious, the application for a stay must be considered as justified.\u201d18\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 23, citing *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v.

In particular, Hungary asserts that the basis of its annulment application is the *Achmea* Decision20, which \u201cgive[s] rise to a key question of jurisdiction.\u201d21 Hungary states that it is not asking the Committee to conduct an assessment of the strengths of Hungary\u2019s Application for Annulment as this would be inappropriate at this stage of the proceeding.22 As a result, not staying enforcement is inappropriate since the Award may be annulled in its entirety23 and this \u201cpotential for annulment of the Award in its entirety is in itself a circumstance that justifies a stay.\u201d24 Further, Hungary states that in the *Dan Cake* revision proceedings, the tribunal granted Hungary\u2019s request for the continued stay of enforcement on the basis of, among others, that the jurisdiction issue raised by Hungary with respect to the *Achmea* Decision was genuine.25 Hungary submits that in the present case, the same \u201cgenuine\u201d issue of jurisdiction with respect to the *Achmea* Decision exists.26\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 28, citing *Slovak Republic v.

According to Hungary, its submission is that its request under Article 52(2) is made in good faith absent any dilatory conduct, and as a justified exercise of its procedural rights of defence.27\n\nReply, para. 39.\n\n24.\n\nFurthermore, Hungary states that the rapid briefing schedule agreed to by the Parties suggests absence of dilatory conduct on its part.28\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 30; Reply, para. 47.\n\n***b. Stay of Enforcement Would Not Cause Sodexo to Suffer Irreparable Harm***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nHungary argues that because Sodexo is \u201clarge and financially sound\u201d and \u201cnot at risk of imminent insolvency,\u201d a brief delay in enforcement would not cause Sodexo to suffer irreparable harm.29 Hungary dismisses Sodexo's assertion that Sodexo's legal right to enforcement is not contingent upon its financial standing.30\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, paras. 31-33, referring to the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements of Sodexo (**R-81**); Reply, para. 53.\n\nReply, para. 50.\n\n26.\n\nHungary further contends that, in any case, the post-Award interest would compensate for the damages caused by the delay in enforcement.31 To support this assertion, Hungary relies on *Azurix* which found that \u201c[t]he provision for interest compensates for the delay.\u201d32 Hungary states that, as was the case in *Azurix*, Sodexo would also not be severely prejudiced by the continued stay of enforcement.33\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, paras. 34-36; Reply, paras. 54-58.\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 34, citing *Azurix,* para. 40 (emphasis added by the Applicant).\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 35.\n\n27.\n\nIn reply to Sodexo's assertion that there is no risk of non-recoupment by Hungary, since Sodexo is financially sound, Hungary argues that Sodexo's assertion is unpersuasive.34 In Hungary's view, recoupment of sums paid in enforcement would result in unnecessary time, cost and resources being expended.35 Hungary argues that the tribunal in *Dan Cake* emphasized that this circumstance weighs in favour of the continuation of the stay.36 Thus, the Committee should weigh the potential consequences and decide in favour of continuing the stay.37\n\nReply, para. 59.\n\nReply, para. 60.\n\nReply, para. 60 citing *Dan Cake*, para. 62.\n\nReply, para. 61.\n\n***c.

Further, Hungary declared on January 16, 2019 that it would seek to set aside inter-EU investment arbitration awards.38 For that reason, Hungary contends that Sodexo could have foreseen that Hungary would challenge the Award and secure a provisional stay of enforcement.39\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 38, referring to Declaration of the Representative of the Government of Hungary on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union, January 16, 2019 (\u201c**Hungary\u2019s Declaration**\u201d) (**RLA-176**), p. 2, undertaking no. 2.\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 39.\n\n30.\n\nSecond, Hungary asserts that Sodexo wrongly listed Hungary\u2019s representative for purposes of the enforcement proceedings and failed to duly notify it of the existence of a dispute.40 Hungary states that Sodexo was in contact with the correct representative throughout the arbitration proceedings, including the request for voluntary enforcement of the Award, but \u201cinexplicably sought to serve [enforcement] proceedings on a different arm of the State.\u201d41 Hungary dismisses Sodexo\u2019s assertion that it was not in its interest to name the wrong representative in the enforcement proceedings. In Hungary\u2019s view, Sodexo could have re-filed the application identifying the correct representative. Hungary notes that Sodexo chose not to notify Hungary's legal counsel in these proceedings, DLA Piper, of the filing.42\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, paras. 41-43; Reply, 66.\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, paras. 41-43; Reply, paras. 66-67.\n\nReply, para. 68.\n\n31.\n\nHungary states that under its domestic law, the Court was bound to rule on Sodexo's application for enforcement dated May 10, 2019 within 15 days, *i.e.,* on May 27, 2019, a day before the expiration of the time-period for filing an application for annulment under the ICSID Convention.43 Hungary therefore argues that Sodexo's attempt to enforce the Award \u201cin anticipation of and in parallel with the annulment proceedings\u201d indicates bad faith on the part of Sodexo, weighing in favour of granting a continued stay of enforcement.44\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 45, referring to Claimant\u2019s letter to the *ad hoc* Committee, August 21, 2019 (**R-82**), p. 1.\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 46; Reply, paras. 62, 65.\n\n32.\n\nThird, Hungary argues that Sodexo's continued enforcement efforts by filing an appeal against the first instance decision of the Court dated July 11, 2019, which rejected Sodexo's enforcement application, are a clear breach of the provisional stay.45 Hungary rejects Sodexo's contention that it had no other choice than to appeal the Court's decision to preserve its rights, arguing that the Court's decision has no *res judicata* effect.46 Hungary argues that Sodexo should have known that its subsequent attempt to suspend the appeal would be unsuccessful because \u201cthere is no possibility, under Hungarian law, for the court competent to decide on ordering enforcement to suspend the proceedings before it.\u201d47 Hungary also dismisses Sodexo's assertion that the enforcement proceedings would require that the stay is lifted.\n\nReply, para. 70.\n\nReply, para. 71.\n\nReply, paras. 72-73.\n\n**(5) Provision of Security as a Condition of the Stay is unwarranted**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn response to Sodexo's request for security in the form of a bank guarantee or the posting of an amount due under the Award in an escrow account if the continued stay is granted, Hungary argues that: (i) the provision of security is not supported by the ICSID Convention; and (ii) there are no compelling reasons to justify the posting of any form of security.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, Hungary states that neither Articles 51(4) nor 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provide for the posting of any form of security or guarantee of payment of an award as a condition for the continued stay of enforcement of an award.48 Relying on the *Enron* and *Azurix ad hoc* committee decisions, Hungary contends that there is no entitlement to security for a party objecting to a stay of enforcement.49 Moreover, Hungary observes that *ad hoc* committees refrain from requiring any conditions for continuation of a stay absent any compelling reasons such as, history of non-payment of final ICSID awards by the State or a failure to put in place domestic enforcement mechanisms.50 Hungary asserts that in order to balance the rights of the investor and the State, the provision of security should not be ordered.51\n\nReply, para. 82.\n\nReply, paras. 83-84, citing *Enron,* para. 44 and *Azurix,* para. 35.\n\nReply, para. 85, citing *Carnegie Minerals (Gambia) Limited v.

Further, Hungary dismisses Sodexo's characterization of Hungary's Declaration55 which stated that Hungary \u201cwill request the courts\u201d to set aside the awards in proceedings relating to intra-EU BITs, but Hungary notes that the Declaration does not \u201ccontain a declaration by Hungary that it will not comply with this Award if the Award is upheld.\u201d56\n\nReply, para. 92.\n\nReply, para. 93.\n\nReply, para. 94.\n\nHungary\u2019s Declaration of January 16, 2019.\n\nReply, paras. 92-94, 96-100.\n\n36.\n\nAccording to Hungary, the Court rightly rejected Sodexo\u2019s application for the enforcement of the Award because the application was premature in light of the provisional stay of enforcement granted in the annulment proceedings.57 Therefore, Hungary submits that Sodexo\u2019s conclusion that the Hungarian judicial system was incapable of enforcing ICSID awards is baseless.58 Hungary contends that Sodexo failed to disprove the existence of an effective domestic enforcement procedure in compliance with Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, specifically that: (i) Hungary failed to enact any specific laws that implement Article 54 of the ICSID Convention; and (ii) Hungary\u2019s internal laws fail to give effect to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.59\n\nReply, para. 103.\n\nReply, paras. 103-105.\n\nReply, para. 106.\n\n37.\n\nAs to Sodexo\u2019s reliance on the *Sempra* case, Hungary states that the circumstances in the present case are distinct.60 In *Sempra*, Argentina was ordered to place a portion of the amount granted under the award in escrow because of the State\u2019s history of non-compliance with ICSID awards. Hungary asserts that its attitude towards ICSID awards cannot be compared to the conduct of the State in *Sempra* since Hungary has a track record of paying ICSID awards.61 In Hungary\u2019s view, Sodexo\u2019s assertion that Hungary \u201chas not and most probably will not comply with its enforcement obligations under the ICSID Convention is unacceptable.\u201d62\n\nReply, para. 107, referring to Response, paras. 102-105, citing *Sempra,* paras. 102-105.\n\nReply, para. 108.\n\nReply, para. 108, referring to Response, para. 88.\n\n38.\n\nIn conclusion, Hungary submits that Sodexo has not met the high threshold under the ICSID Convention for posting of security as a condition for a stay. In particular, Hungary asserts that Sodexo has not demonstrated: (i) a history of non-payment by Hungary of final ICSID Awards, or the absence of a proper mechanism in Hungary to ensure the implementation of ICSID awards; or (ii) any other exceptional circumstance justifying an order of security.63 In reliance on *Azurix,* Hungary submits that under the circumstances, a request for the posting of security as a condition of the stay should be rejected and the stay of enforcement should be ordered unconditionally.64\n\nReply, para. 109.\n\nReply, paras. 110-111, citing *Azurix,* para. 39.\n\n39.\n\nFinally, in its Reply, Hungary reserved its right to seek leave from the Committee to respond to the Rejoinder within the limited subject-matter of the posting of security.65 Hungary states that it should be afforded the opportunity to have the \u201clast word\u201d on this issue which was first raised in the Response.\n\nReply, para. 112.\n\n40.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Hungary requests the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award until a decision on annulment is rendered and for Sodexo to bear all costs borne by Hungary \u201cin relation to the Application for Annulment, including the costs of presenting and defending this application.\u201d66\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 47; Reply, para. 114.\n\n**B.** **T****he** **C****laimant****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nSodexo's arguments in response to Hungary's application for the continuation of the stay of enforcement are three-fold: (i) Hungary failed to establish the circumstances requiring a stay of enforcement; (ii) the provisional stay should be terminated as there is a high risk of future non-compliance of the Award by Hungary; and (iii) should the Committee grant a continued stay, such stay \u201cshould necessarily be conditioned upon the delivery of an international first demand bank guarantee by Hungary or, alternatively, by the placement of the amounts due by Hungary under the Award on escrow.\u201d67\n\nResponse, paras. 9-10.\n\n**(1) Hungary Failed to Establish the Circumstances Requiring a Stay of Enforcement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nSodexo argues that: (a) Hungary's attempts to shift its burden of proof as regards the continued stay to Sodexo fails; (b) Hungary's attempts to lower the applicable standard of proof also fails; and (c) none of the circumstances put forward by Hungary are relevant with respect to the continuation of the stay.\n\n***a. Hungary\u2019s attempt to shift the burden of proof onto Sodexo is to no avail***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAt the outset, Sodexo agrees with Hungary's submission that the Committee has power to order the continuation of the stay of enforcement pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.68 Sodexo also does not contest Hungary's assertion that Rule 54(4) of the Arbitration Rules requires that a party applying for annulment of an award also requests a stay of its enforcement and that such a party \u201cshall specify the circumstances that require the stay.\u201d69 According to Sodexo, a stay of enforcement will only be granted if an applicant has established that the \u201ccircumstances so require\u201d the stay and that absent such circumstances, enforcement of an award should not be stayed.70\n\nResponse, para. 12.\n\nResponse, para. 13.\n\nResponse, para. 14.\n\n44.\n\nFirst, Sodexo asserts that granting of a stay of enforcement is in no way automatic. Sodexo dismisses Hungary's assertion that the granting of the stay of enforcement is \u201cquasi-automatic,\u201d and rejects Hungary's reliance on *Elsamex*, *Pey Casado* and *Enron*.71 According to Sodexo, none of these committees stated that the stay of enforcement of an award was automatic.72 Sodexo submits that the correct approach was stated by the *ad hoc* committee in *Total* which held in relevant part, that \u201c[...]the stay of enforcement in the ICSID system is far from automatic. The fact that statistically *ad hoc* committees may have granted the stay in the vast majority of cases does not mean that the stay is automatic.\u201d73 Therefore, Sodexo relies on the finding of the Committee in *Churchill* which found that, \u201c[...]whatever the practice of granting stays might be in the Applicants\u2019 eyes, a stay must remain exceptional.\u201d74\n\nResponse, para. 16, referring to Application for Continued Stay, paras. 18-19.\n\nResponse, para. 17.\n\nResponse, para. 18, citing *Total S.A. v.

Sodexo contends that it is under no obligation to demonstrate that the continued stay should not be granted by establishing circumstances which would justify the immediate enforcement of the Award.76 To support that contention, Sodexo argues that numerous *ad hoc* committees (specifically citing *Pezold*, *OI European Group* and *Burlington*) have held that it is for the requesting party to establish that there are circumstances that require continuation of the stay.77 According to Sodexo, Hungary failed to put forward any of the exceptional circumstances to compel the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement even though the burden lies clearly with it to establish such exceptional circumstances.78\n\nResponse, para. 20, referring to Application for Continued Stay, para. 21.\n\nResponse, paras. 22-24, citing *Bernhard von Pezold and Others v.

None of the Circumstances Presented by Hungary Justify a Continued Stay of Enforcement***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nSodexo contends that none of the three circumstances identified by Hungary in its submissions justify, let alone require, a continued stay of enforcement.82 In response to Hungary's arguments, Sodexo submits that: (i) the fact that Hungary's Application for Annulment is made in good faith does not warrant the granting of a continued stay of enforcement; (ii) the grounds and merits of Hungary's Application for Annulment are irrelevant with respect to the stay; (iii) Sodexo's financial standing is irrelevant; (iv) whether or not Sodexo was granted post-Award interest is irrelevant; and (v) Sodexo's attempt to enforce the Award cannot weigh in favour of the stay of enforcement, but rather necessarily requires that it be lifted.\n\nSee paragraphs 19-32 above.\n\n49.\n\nFirst, Sodexo argues that Hungary's contention that the application was made in good faith does not warrant a grant of stay. Sodexo rejects Hungary's submission that absent any evidence that the application for annulment of the Award is purely dilatory or vexatious, the application for a stay must be considered as justified. In Sodexo's view, Hungary's argument is wrong because it would mean that stays of enforcement would be automatically granted in all annulment proceedings which are not purely dilatory or vexatious, which is not the case. Further, it would require the responding party to establish that the application for annulment was purely dilatory or vexatious for the stay not to be granted, which shifts the burden of proof.83\n\nResponse, para. 33.\n\n50.\n\nSodexo rejects Hungary's reliance on *Patrick Mitchell, Libananco* and *Enron* and argues that none of these cases support Hungary's position.84 According to Sodexo, none of these cases indicate that \u201cthe application for a stay of enforcement is justified, whenever the application for annulment was neither dilatory nor vexatious.\u201d85 Sodexo states that several *ad hoc* committees such as *SGS* have explicitly held the contrary position.86 Sodexo therefore argues that Hungary cannot benefit from a stay merely because it acted in good faith; this is the expected minimum standard of behaviour.87 Further, Sodexo underscores that it has a greater interest in an expeditious annulment procedure and states that Hungary waited for 119 days before applying for annulment.88\n\nResponse, para. 34.\n\nResponse, para. 34.\n\nResponse, para. 35, citing *SGS,* para. 94.\n\nResponse, paras. 34-36; Rejoinder, paras. 35, 38.\n\nResponse, para. 37.\n\n51.\n\nSecond, Sodexo asserts that the grounds and merits of Hungary's Application for Annulment are irrelevant with respect to the stay of enforcement. Sodexo contends that the continued stay of enforcement should not be considered as justified merely because the Application for Annulment concerns a \u201ckey question of jurisdiction.\u201d Sodexo argues that a question of jurisdiction that allegedly leads to the annulment of the Award \u201cin its entirety\u201d should not be \u201ca relevant circumstance to take into account when deciding on the continued stay.\u201d89 Sodexo states that the *ad hoc* committees in other cases including *Tenaris* and *Kardassopoulos*, unanimously adopted a position of not looking into the grounds of annulment or the strength of the arguments in support of the applications for annulment.90\n\nResponse, paras. 40-45; Rejoinder, para. 42.\n\nResponse, para. 42, citing *Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v.

Sodexo argues that its right to enforcement is guaranteed by the ICSID Convention and is \u201cnot contingent upon its financial standing.\u201d91 Sodexo argues that, as held by the *ad hoc* committee in *Patrick Mitchell,* Sodexo\u2019s financial standing should not influence the Committee\u2019s reasoning as regards the stay of enforcement, as it is a contingent issue which falls \u201coutside the context of the present proceedings.\u201d92 On the other hand, Sodexo submits that any delay in the enforcement would cause harm to it.93 In response to Hungary\u2019s argument that Sodexo relied on the minority position adopted by three *ad hoc* committees to argue that post-Award interest should not be deemed to compensate Sodexo for the delay, Sodexo argues that a recent decision in *Infrastructure Services* supports its position. In that case, the Committee stated that \u201cthe payment of interest should not be considered a sufficient remedy for any prejudice caused by a delay in the Award\u2019s enforcement.\u201d94\n\nResponse, para. 47.\n\nResponse, paras. 48-49, citing*Patrick Mitchell,* para. 25.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 48-49.\n\nRejoinder, para. 53, citing *Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and Energia Termosolar B.

According to Sodexo, Hungary's argument ignores the fundamental principle that \u201cdespite an application for annulment, awards must be enforced.\u201d96 Sodexo submits that the post-Award interest will not compensate the harm it has suffered due to the continued stay and the difficulties in enforcement Sodexo will face before the Hungarian courts.97\n\nResponse, para. 52, citing *SGS*, para. 85.\n\nResponse, paras. 51-54; Rejoinder, paras. 49-54.\n\n55.\n\nFifth, Sodexo argues that its legitimate exercise of its right to enforcement does not weigh in favour of the stay but rather requires that the stay be lifted. Sodexo argues that its attempt to enforce the Award was not done in bad faith nor in parallel with the annulment proceedings as alleged by Hungary.98\n\nResponse, para. 57.\n\n56.\n\nSodexo states that it initiated enforcement proceedings due to the lack of response by Hungary to Sodexo's request to comply with the Award.99 Sodexo further asserts that Hungary's allegation that it listed the wrong state representative is baseless and whether or not Sodexo served the wrong representative is still being debated in the Hungarian court.100 Sodexo argues that listing a wrong representative would lengthen the proceedings or lead to the dismissal of its enforcement application altogether, thus would be of no benefit to it. In addition, Hungary's assertion that, as a result of listing the wrong representative, Hungary was not put on notice of the enforcement proceedings is irrelevant, since the proceedings are conducted *ex parte.* Sodexo asserts that Hungary was notified of the decision of the Court and these events do not in any way indicate bad faith on the part of Sodexo.101\n\nResponse, para. 60; Rejoinder, paras. 69-72.\n\nResponse, para. 65.\n\nResponse, paras. 64-65; Rejoinder, paras. 73-78.\n\n57.\n\nSodexo also states that the enforcement proceedings began prior to Hungary's Application for Annulment; thus, the two proceedings did not occur in parallel to each other.102 Sodexo states that it applied for the suspension of the enforcement proceedings pursuant to the provisional stay of enforcement granted by the Secretary-General. However, Sodexo states that it \u201chad no other choice than to file an appeal\u201d of the Court Decision that dismissed both Sodexo's requests for enforcement and for suspension of the enforcement proceedings. Sodexo informed the Committee of these proceedings.103\n\nResponse, para. 67; Rejoinder, para. 81.\n\nResponse, paras. 66-67.\n\n58.\n\nBased on the above, Sodexo requests the Committee to reject all the arguments asserted by Hungary in support of the continued stay of enforcement and \u201cto declare that Hungary has simply failed to establish that the present circumstances requires a stay of enforcement.\u201d104\n\nResponse, para. 68.\n\n**(2) The Risk of Future Non-Compliance of the Award Warrants the Termination of the Provisional Stay**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nSodexo argues that the provisional stay should be terminated because there is a higher risk of non-compliance by Hungary.105 Sodexo states that compliance should play a decisive role in the Committee's conclusion.106 Hungary publicly declared that it will request the courts \u201cto set awards aside or not to enforce them\u201d following the *Achmea* Decision and this establishes a high-risk of non-compliance with the Award.107 Sodexo points out that Hungary refused to comply with the Award pursuant to Sodexo's letter demanding payment after the Award was rendered.108\n\nResponse, para. 70; Rejoinder, para. 91.\n\nResponse, para. 71.\n\nResponse, para. 75; Rejoinder, paras. 95-98.\n\nResponse, para. 77; Rejoinder, para. 97.\n\n60.\n\nSodexo also states that the decision of the Court of September 24, 2019 finding that the Award \u201cimpose[d] no obligation\u201d on Hungary,109 among other findings of the Court, demonstrate that there is a high risk of non-compliance by Hungary. Specifically, Sodexo points out that the order of the Court which drew a distinction between \u201cHungary\u201d and \u201cHungarian State\u201d, found that enforcement proceedings can be carried out only against the Hungarian State.110 According to Sodexo, this interpretation effectively means that \u201cno ICSID Award can ever be enforced against Hungary in its own country.\u201d111 According to Sodexo, it further proves that there is a high risk of non-compliance by Hungary.112\n\nResponse, para. 80; Rejoinder, para. 101.\n\nResponse, para. 80; Rejoinder, para. 104.\n\nResponse, para. 80; Rejoinder, para. 108.\n\nResponse, paras. 79-81; Rejoinder, paras. 100-108.\n\n**(3) Continued Stay Should be Conditioned on the Provision of a Bank Guarantee or the Placement of Amounts Due under the Award in an Escrow Account**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nSodexo submits that in any event, should the Committee grant the stay - given the Court\u2019s attitude of complicating and delaying enforcement and the high risk of non-compliance on the part of Hungary - the continued stay be conditioned upon the delivery of an international first demand bank guarantee by Hungary.113 Sodexo argues that *ad hoc* committees consider ordering the provision of a bank guarantee when there are legitimate fears of non-enforcement.114 Sodexo contends that Hungary has demonstrated that it \u201cwill not comply with the Award nor with its enforcement obligations under the ICSID Convention.\u201d115 Sodexo states that *ad hoc* committees have power to condition continued stays upon the posting of a security and have done so in \u201c12 out of a total of 40 cases\u201d.116\n\nResponse, para. 88; Rejoinder, paras. 116-119.\n\nResponse, para. 87.\n\nResponse, para. 88.\n\nResponse, paras. 83-88; Rejoinder, paras. 113-115.\n\n62.\n\nSodexo argues that requiring security also balances the Parties\u2019 interests.117 Sodexo states that ordering a security would \u201c(i) compensate Sodexo for the additional delay of enforcement of the Award; (ii) dissipate Hungary's concerns related to the potential recoupment of sums paid to Sodexo and, therefore, benefit Hungary in the event that the Award were annulled; and (iii) prevent both Parties from incurring unnecessary time, costs and resources in enforcement proceedings during the present annulment phase.\u201d118\n\nRejoinder, para. 120.\n\nRejoinder, para. 130.\n\n63.\n\nSodexo also proposes that the continued stay be automatically terminated if the Parties cannot reach an agreement on the particular terms and conditions of the first demand bank guarantee within 30 days.119\n\nResponse, para. 91.\n\n64.\n\nAlternatively, Sodexo submits that in the event that the stay of enforcement is continued without being conditional upon the delivery of a first demand international bank guarantee, for the same reasons, Hungary should be ordered \u201cto place the full amounts due under the Award (including post-Award interest) in an escrow account with a first-tier reputable international bank (acting as escrow agent) with no principal establishment in Hungary.120 Again, Sodexo proposes that the continued stay should be automatically terminated if the Parties cannot reach an escrow agreement within 30 days.121\n\nResponse, para. 92; Rejoinder, paras. 110, 130.\n\nResponse, para. 95; Rejoinder, para. 138.\n\n65.\n\nIn summary, Sodexo requests that the Committee reject Hungary's application for the continued stay of enforcement of the Award; terminate the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award; and order Hungary to reimburse all costs incurred in relation to the stay of enforcement.122 In the event that the Committee were to grant the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, Sodexo requests the Committee to order Hungary to provide \u201can unconditional and irrevocable first demand bank guarantee\u201d or to order that \u201cthe full amount due under the Award (including post-Award interest) be placed by Hungary in an escrow account with a first-tier reputable international bank\u201d and also to order Hungary to reimburse all costs incurred in relation to the stay of enforcement.123\n\nResponse, para. 96.\n\nResponse, paras. 96-97.\n\n66.\n\nSodexo opposes Hungary's request that it should be allowed to file a further response to Sodexo's rejoinder with regard to the issue of security. Sodexo asserts that this issue was not novel to Hungary and that Hungary had an opportunity to address it in its Reply submission but failed to do so. Sodexo therefore requests that the Committee deny Hungary the possibility of seeking leave to file a reply to the Rejoinder with respect to the issue of the posting of security.124\n\nRejoinder, paras. 139-143.\n\n**III. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Committee will first address the legal standard applicable to an application for a continued stay of enforcement; and thereafter consider whether there are circumstances in this particular case that require the continuation of the stay of enforcement.\n\n**A.** **T****he** **A****pplicable** **L****egal** **S****tandard**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention establishes the power of the Committee to grant or reject Hungary's request for the continued stay of enforcement of the Award:\n\n*The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n69.\n\nRule 54 of the Arbitration Rules specifies the procedure as follows:\n\n*(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\n\n*(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.*\n\n*(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).*\n\n*(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) [for a stay or its modification or termination] shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.*\n\n70.\n\nIt follows from Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention that the Committee's decision on the continuation of a stay is discretionary (\u201cthe Committee *may* [...]\u201d). In addition, according to the same provision the Committee's discretionary decision must be based on its appreciation of the specific circumstances of each case (\u201c[...] if it considers that the circumstances so require [...]\u201d). Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention does not specify the relevant circumstances that the Committee shall consider, a further indication of the Committee's discretion in this respect.125\n\nSee *Burlington*, para. 70; *Kardassopoulos*, para 29.\n\n71.\n\nHungary concurs that this is the proper legal standard under the Convention126 - a position that the Claimant does not contest.127 Also, the Parties are in agreement that Arbitration Rule 54(4) requires that a party requesting a stay of enforcement \u201cshall specify the circumstances that require the stay.\u201d128\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, paras. 12-15; Reply, para. 34.\n\nResponse, para. 12.\n\nSee Application for Continued Stay, para. 14 and Response, para. 14.\n\n72.\n\nNonetheless, the Parties disagree with respect to what should be the starting point for the Committee in considering whether or not to grant the continuation of the stay, an issue that is closely linked to the question of burden of proof in satisfying the conditions for the continuation or lifting of the stay. In particular, the Parties have presented opposing positions regarding the right to enforcement of the Award in relation to the procedural rights of the other party to seek annulment of the Award and to request a continuation of the stay of enforcement.129\n\nSee Reply, para 15: \"[...]as much Claimant has a right to seek enforcement of the Award, Hungary has a right to seek that any enforcement be stayed [...].\u201d\n\n73.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes that an award is binding and immediately enforceable, \u201cexcept to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\u201d Thus, the ICSID Convention appears to attempt to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the binding nature and enforceability of ICSID awards and, on the other hand, the procedural right of the parties to request an annulment in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, including the right to request a stay of enforcement of the award. As stated by the committee in *Standard Chartered Bank,* \u201cthe obligation that each State assumed on ratification of the Convention, under Article 53, to comply with awards against it is particularly important. This obligation is as important as the right to pursue annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. These two articles are linked together.\u201d130\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank,* para. 84.\n\n74.\n\nIn addition, the Parties have argued extensively whether granting a request for the continuation of a stay of enforcement is \u201cautomatic\u201d or \u201cquasi-automatic\u201d or if it should be considered rather an exceptional remedy within the ICSID Convention structure.\n\n75.\n\nHungary has used the expression \u201cquasi-automatic\u201d in reference to what in its view is a majority practice by *ad hoc* committees in granting the stay. Hungary clarified in its Reply that the use of that expression was in reference to the practice of *ad hoc* committees in actually granting the stay.131 Sodexo has contested this position as a past trend, citing decisions that in its opinion support a different current practice.132 In the Committee's view, in as much as previous decisions by *ad hoc* committees are useful to illustrate its analysis, this use is limited since, as previously mentioned, granting the continuation of the stay lies within the Committee's discretion and is circumstance-based.\n\nReply, para. 28.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 29-32.\n\n76.\n\nIn the Committee's view, it is now well-accepted that the continuation of a stay is not automatic and that there exists no presumption in favour of a stay of enforcement.133 Moreover, the Committee agrees with those committees that have confirmed that the continuation of the stay remains the exception to the immediate enforceability of ICSID awards.134\n\nSee *Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/11, Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, February 22, 2018 (\u201c***Karkey***\u201d) (**CL-0173**) and the *Standard Chartered Bank* decision. See also *Sempra,* para. 27. In paragraph 17 of its Reply, Hungary clarified its position stating that \u201cClaimant\u2019s attempt to distort Hungary\u2019s submission is misplaced. For the sake of clarity, Hungary has never argued that a stay of enforcement should be granted '*automatically\u2019* in each case an applicant requests it.\u201d\n\n*Kardassopoulos,* para. 26; *Burlington,* para. 73; *Churchill,* para. 34.\n\n77.\n\nThe Parties have dedicated several paragraphs of their written submissions to the question of who bears the burden of proof with respect to a request for a continuation of the stay of enforcement. In this respect the Committee notes that a number of *ad hoc* committees have interpreted Article 52(5) to mean that the burden of establishing circumstances that require the stay of enforcement lies with the party seeking the continuation of the stay.135 Some committees have found that it is part of the committee's discretion to establish the existence of such circumstances.136\n\n*Burlington,* para. 75; *OI European Group,* para. 94.\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank,* para. 53.\n\n78.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee recalls that Rule 54(4) of the Arbitration Rules instructs the party that makes a request \u201cpursuant to paragraphs [54](1), (2) (second sentence) or (3)\u201d to \u201cspecify the circumstances that require the stay[...].\u201d According to the committee in *Carnegie*, \u201c[...] a request to stay enforcement is like any other request before it. A party making the request must bear the burden of establishing the basis for the request.\u201d137 Consequently, the Committee is of the view that as the moving party, Hungary has the burden of proof, albeit that Sodexo should substantiate the positive allegations it relies on for rebutting Hungary's position.\n\n*Carnegie,* para. 42; See also *Karkey,* para. 103.\n\n**B.** **A****re** **T****here** **C****ircumstances that** **R****equire the** **C****ontinuation of the** **S****tay of** **E****nforcement****?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Hungary is in agreement that the party seeking the continuation of the stay of enforcement shall specify the circumstances that satisfy such a request, and that the Committee shall use its discretionary power to consider these circumstances in order to determine whether a continuation of the stay of enforcement should be granted.138 Hungary's arguments in support of its request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement are three-fold: (i) Hungary applied for annulment in good faith; (ii) the stay of enforcement would not cause Sodexo to suffer irreparable harm; and (iii) Sodexo's bad faith attempt to enforce the Award weighs in favour of the stay of enforcement.139\n\nSee Application for Continued Stay, para. 14; Response, para. 13.\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 22.\n\n**(1) The Good Faith and Non-dilatory Nature of the Application**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Hungary that the basis for a finding of the existence of a dilatory or vexatious request for annulment is a stringent one. For such finding, a high threshold must be met, such as that the application for annulment has a manifestly abusive character or was brought without any basis under the ICSID Convention. The Committee is not aware of any decision that has rejected a request for a stay based on this circumstance, which reflects its high threshold. The Committee also notes that rather than forming a requirement that must be demonstrated positively, the bad faith or dilatory purpose of an application for annulment may, if demonstrated to a committee\u2019s satisfaction, serve to rebut a request for a stay.\n\n81.\n\nIn this respect, Sodexo has not argued that Hungary\u2019s Application for Annulment is either in bad faith or has a dilatory purpose. Further, the Committee sees no indication that Hungary\u2019s Application for Annulment does not correspond to the legitimate exercise of its procedural rights under the Convention, which may be presumed to be exercised in good faith.\n\n82.\n\nNevertheless, the Committee is not of the view that, absent any evidence that an application for annulment is purely dilatory or vexatious, the application for a stay of enforcement must be granted. The Committee shares the position of the committee in *OI European Group* which stated that, \u201cthe mere fact that the application is not dilatory is not sufficient to grant the extension of the stay.\u201d140 Furthermore, as Sodexo contends, to sustain such a position would mean that the stay of enforcement should be granted in all annulment proceedings that are not purely dilatory or not instituted in bad faith, which as previously explained, would not be consistent with the Convention.141\n\n*OI European Group,* para. 115.\n\nResponse, para. 33.\n\n83.\n\nFurther, the Committee does not agree with Hungary\u2019s position that the fact that its Application for Annulment is based on the *Achmea* Decision (thus entailing the potential of annulment of the entire Award), is in itself a circumstance that justifies the continuation of the stay.142 As Hungary recognizes, it would be inappropriate for the Committee at this stage of the proceeding to consider the merits of the Application for Annulment. As other committees have stated, the merits of the annulment application are not relevant for the purpose of deciding whether or not to grant the continuation of a stay.143 For that reason, the Committee agrees with Sodexo that the fact that an annulment is based on a \u201ckey question of jurisdiction\u201d that could lead to annulment of the Award in its entirety, is not a relevant circumstance for deciding a request for the continuation of a stay of enforcement.144\n\nReply, para. 48.\n\n*Patrick Mitchell,* para. 60; *OI European Group,* para. 115.\n\nSee Response, para. 40.\n\n**(2) The Financial Standing of Sodexo**\n----------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe second circumstance relied on by Hungary as a basis for its request for continuation of the stay of enforcement is the fact that Sodexo is \u201ca large financially sound\u201d entity. Hungary's position is that the Committee should consider such a factor as weighing in favour of granting the stay because in its view, a brief delay in the enforcement of the Award would not cause Sodexo to suffer irreparable harm.\n\n85.\n\nIn turn, Sodexo alleges that a delay in enforcing the Award will cause harm to it due to the difficulties in enforcement it will face before the Hungarian courts. Hungary contends that post-Award interest would provide Sodexo with sufficient compensation for any damages it would suffer as a consequence of the delay, in the event that the Committee finds against the Application for Annulment. Sodexo argues that post-Award interest would not be an adequate remedy because the prejudice it would face relates to the difficulties in enforcement before the Hungarian courts.\n\n86.\n\nWith respect to Hungary's allegation that the Committee should consider Sodexo's good financial position as weighing in favour of granting the stay, the Committee disagrees with this assertion. The Committee does not see why the fact that a party opposing the continuation of a stay has good financial standing should be a relevant factor for granting the stay, even more so in this case where Hungary has not alleged that the lifting of the stay would cause it irreparable harm. Indeed, the Committee has not been called upon in this case to address a possible balance of hardship to the Parties if the stay is granted or not.\n\n87.\n\nAs for the Parties\u2019 discussion with respect to post-Award interest, it remains unclear to the Committee exactly how a decision to continue the stay would cause specific harm to Sodexo in relation to its enforcement efforts which could not be adequately remedied by interest. Further, the Committee notes that it has not been argued in the present case that any delay caused by the stay would affect the likelihood of enforcement. That notwithstanding, for similar reasons expressed above,145 the Committee does not consider that the availability of post-Award interest is relevant for the specific circumstances of this case, as a factor that would justify or require the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\nIn addition, considering the Committee\u2019s decision expressed in paragraph 93 *infra,* it is not necessary to analyze the merit of Sodexo\u2019s allegation that the continuation of the stay would cause it to suffer an irreparable prejudice that could not be remedied by the post-Award interest.\n\n88.\n\nIn addition, the Parties presented opposing arguments in relation to the financial position of Sodexo and the possible risk of non-recoupment by Hungary. Hungary argues that such risk exists, notwithstanding Sodexo\u2019s good financial standing, because in any case recoupment of sums paid in enforcement would result in unnecessary time, cost and resources being expended. The Committee considers that, to the contrary, Sodexo\u2019s financially sound position, recognized by Hungary, is a circumstance that militates against such risk.146 Further, the Committee agrees with Sodexo that the risk of non-recoupment as alleged by Hungary is present in every single annulment proceeding - being a risk inherent in any enforcement of an ICSID award.147\n\n*Karkey,* para. 115; *Standard Chartered Bank,* para. 73.\n\nResponse, para. 50.\n\n**(3) The Claimant\u2019s Attempt to Enforce the Award Before the Hungarian Courts**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe third factor invoked by Hungary as a basis for its request for the continuation of the stay is that Sodexo commenced recognition and enforcement proceedings of the Award before the Budapest Capital Regional Court in bad faith and in parallel with the annulment proceedings. According to Hungary, Sodexo improperly \u201c[...] hastily initiated proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of the Award [...]\u201d148 when it \u201c[...] was undoubtedly foreseeable for [Sodexo] that Hungary would challenge the Award and secure its provisional stay of enforcement [...].\u201d149 In addition, Hungary alleges that in its application to the Court, Sodexo wrongly listed Hungary's representative for purposes of the enforcement and failed to duly notify it of the existence of its application for enforcement.\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 40.\n\nApplication for Continued Stay, para. 39.\n\n90.\n\nThe Committee rejects Hungary's allegation of bad faith by Sodexo. First, when Sodexo filed for the enforcement of the Award with the Court, no application for annulment and request for stay of enforcement had been filed by Hungary, therefore, the Award was enforceable under Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, a fact which Hungary does not dispute. In the absence of a pending annulment application and a declaration of provisional stay by the Secretary-General, the Committee sees no reason why Sodexo should have refrained from exercising its rights under the ICSID Convention and, as a consequence, how that could be considered to have been done in bad faith.\n\n91.\n\nIn addition, the Committee also does not consider that listing the wrong Hungarian representative for enforcement proceedings before its Courts - even if that were the case150- could be considered an act of procedural bad faith. From the information available to the Committee, it is difficult to understand how allegedly listing a wrong representative would benefit Sodexo. The likely result would be that this would work against Sodexo's own interests by delaying the enforcement proceedings. As to the allegation by Hungary that the wrong identification of its representative affected its procedural rights, the Committee is not aware, from the evidence submitted by the Parties, of any such prejudice, more so where the first stage of the enforcement proceedings under Hungarian law is an *ex-parte* proceeding, as acknowledged by Hungary.151\n\nThe Claimant contests that it wrongly listed the representative under Hungarian law.\n\nSee Application for Continued Stay, footnote 24.\n\n92.\n\nWith respect to Hungary's allegation that Sodexo pursued enforcement of the Award in parallel with the annulment proceedings, and that its filing of an appeal against the first instance decision of the Court which rejected the Claimant's enforcement application are a breach of the provisional stay and a further demonstration of bad faith in the Claimant's behaviour, the Committee finds that as was expressed previously, it is not disputed that Sodexo's application for enforcement to the Hungarian Court occurred before the declaration of the provisional stay. Moreover, as regards the continuation of the enforcement proceedings after the provisional stay came into effect, the Committee is satisfied with the explanation provided by the Claimant that it applied for suspension of the enforcement proceedings before the Court.\n\n93.\n\nIn light of the foregoing analysis, the Committee finds that Hungary has failed to satisfy the burden of proof to show that there are circumstances in this case that would require the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. In the absence of such justification, the Committee concludes that the provisional stay of enforcement should be lifted.\n\n94.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, it is not necessary for the Committee to deal with the Claimant's allegation that in the present case there is a risk of future non-compliance with the Award by Hungary. It is also unnecessary to analyse Sodexo's request to order Hungary to provide \u201can unconditional and irrevocable first demand bank guarantee\u201d or to order that \u201cthe full amount due under the Award (including post-Award interest) be placed by Hungary in an escrow account with a first-tier reputable international bank.\u201d152 Accordingly, Hungary's request for leave to respond to the issue of security as a condition for the stay is also therefore dismissed.\n\nResponse, paras. 83 and 92; Rejoinder, paras. 110 and 133.\n\n**IV.** **DECISION**\n--------------------\n\n95.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Committee:\n\n(i) decides that the stay of enforcement of the Award should not be continued; and\n\n(ii) reserves its decision on costs incurred in this Application for Continued Stay until the conclusion of the annulment proceeding."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment (Excerpts)", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2021-05-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment (Excerpts)\n--------------------------------\n\n**Table of Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n----------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Achmea* Decision | *Slovak Republic v.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis decision concerns an application for annulment (the \"**Application**\"), submitted by Hungary (\"**Hungary**\", the \"**Applicant**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"), of the Award rendered on January 28, 2019, by a tribunal composed of Professor William W. Park (President), Mr. Andrea Carlevaris, and Mr. John Christopher Thomas QC (the \"**Tribunal**\") in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/20 (the \"**Award**\") in the arbitration proceeding between Sodexo Pass International SAS (\"**Sodexo**\" or the \"**Claimant**\") and Hungary. The Award was accompanied by the separate and dissenting opinion of Mr. Thomas dated January 19, 2019 (the \"**Separate and Dissenting Opinion**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Applicant and the Claimant are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\" and individually referred to as a \"**Party**.\" The Parties' legal representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (ii).\n\n3.\n\nThe Award decided a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the People's Republic of Hungary on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated November 6, 1986, which entered into force on April 10, 2006 (the \"**BIT**\" or the \"**Treaty**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\") which entered into force on October 14, 1966.\n\n4.\n\nIn 1993, Sodexo S.A. incorporated its Hungarian subsidiary (\"**Sodexo Pass Hungary**\" or \"**SPH**\") to conduct a food and meal voucher business. Three years later, Sodexo S.A. incorporated Sodexo Pass International (Sodexo) as a French company, which is the Claimant in this proceeding.\n\n5.\n\nThe facts of this case are similar to two other food voucher cases, *Edenred v. Hungary* and *UP and CD v. Hungary*.1 The investors in all three cases depended on a Hungarian tax regime in place at the relevant time, which was favorable to their business.\n\n*Edenred S.A. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/21 and *UP (formerly Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner) and C.D Holding Internationale v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/35.\n\n6.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.\n\nSodexo brought an expropriation case against Hungary based on Article 9 of the 1986 France-Hungary BIT. The *Edenred v. Hungary* and *UP and CD v. Hungary* cases are based on the same BIT. Article 9(2) defines the scope of arbitration by limiting arbitration to \"disputes concerning dispossession measures [\u2026].\"\n\n8.\n\nThe award in *Edenred* was rendered on December 13, 2016 and on June 14, 2017, the Tribunal indicated to the Parties that its analysis might benefit from seeing the *Edenred* award. The Claimant did not object to this, but Hungary opposed it on the basis that it would be prejudicial and unfair. On June 26, 2017, the Tribunal directed that the *Edenred* award be disclosed to the Tribunal, redacted with respect to Edenred's confidential information only, but not regarding the facts of the case.\n\n9.\n\nThe award in *UP* was rendered on October 9, 2018, and on October 11, 2018, Sodexo requested that the Tribunal admit the *UP* award into the record of this case. The Tribunal granted the Claimant's request and ordered the production of the *UP* award by the Respondent. Because this award was already in the public domain (according to the Respondent, released by unauthorized sources), the Respondent submitted it unredacted.\n\n10.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n11.\n\nIn addition, the EC applied to the Tribunal for leave to intervene in the case as a non-disputing party. After reviewing the Parties' comments, the Tribunal granted the EC's request, and the EC submitted its *amicus curiae* brief on September 14, 2018.\n\n12.\n\nThe EC's submission focused on the impact of the *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV* case (\"***Achmea*** **Decision**\")2 on the Tribunal's jurisdiction. First, the EC argued that, under the principle of primacy, EU law prevails over the BIT's arbitration clause (Article 9(2) of the BIT) in the event of conflict of laws. Thus, Article 9(2) of the BIT became invalid when Hungary joined the European Union (\"**EU**\"). Second, the principle of posteriority found at Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) (\"**VCLT**\") supports the EC's view because Article 30(3) provides that when the parties to an earlier treaty are also parties to a later treaty, but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with the later treaty. Third, the EC argued that *Achmea*'s reasoning that intra-EU investment arbitration is incompatible with EU law is applicable to ICSID arbitrations because the ICSID system precludes review of an award by a national judge of a Member State, thus forestalling any possibility that a judge of a Member State's court could control the substance of an ICSID award. The EC made other arguments such as the sunset clause seeking to prolong the applicability of the arbitration clause being invalid, and that any award in this dispute would be unenforceable because it would be based on an invalid consent.\n\nS*lovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Case C-284/16, Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber), March 6, 2018, EU:C:2018:158 (\"***Achmea***\") (**RLA-1**).\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the dispute before it did not involve the application of the law of any EU State or of the EU itself. Article 9(3) of the BIT indicates that the Tribunal shall apply the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law. This is in contrast to some BITs which refer to the application of the laws of the host State, as in Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT that was central to the decision in *Achmea*. Also, the Tribunal noted that there was no allegation of a violation of EU law in this case. Based on this, the Tribunal applied neither Hungarian law nor EU law. In addition, the Tribunal found that the CJEU ruling would not bind the Tribunal but the EU state court in Germany that referred the case, and the ruling's *erga omnes* effect affects EU Member State courts, not an ICSID tribunal. The Tribunal found that the TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT do not share the same subject matter, as required for application of the VCLT's provisions 59 and 30 on conflicts and that neither the TFEU's nor the VCLT's provisions on conflict of laws apply in this arbitration. Thus, the Tribunal found that the *Achmea* Decision did not preclude its jurisdiction in this case.\n\n14.\n\nThe Majority found that Sodexo's shareholding rights in SPH constituted a protected investment under the BIT, and such rights were the subject of expropriation. The Tribunal proposed a definition of indirect expropriation which the Parties accepted. Based on this definition, the Tribunal found that Hungary's various changes to its tax laws constituted a series of measures leading to the indirect expropriation. The Tribunal also found that these tax law changes substantially deprived the Claimant of the fundamental attributes of property in its investment, including use and enjoyment. The changes rendered the Claimant's investment worthless as its value was transferred to the State. Based on their object, content and intent, the Tribunal found that the tax measures were not made for a public purpose. The Tribunal also found that the severity of the tax measures made them disproportional to their stated objectives. The Tribunal concluded that all these factors militate in favor of a finding of expropriation rather than *bona fide* regulatory measures.\n\n15.\n\nBased on the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle of full reparation as reflected in Article 31 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001), the Tribunal found that compensation is the most appropriate form of full reparation in this case. The BIT's own formula for compensation is \"prompt, adequate and effective payment.\" The BIT also refers to \"real value\" which the Tribunal found to be equivalent to Fair Market Value. Given Sodexo's proven record of profitability, the Tribunal accepted the Discounted Cash Flow method to be an appropriate standard of valuation to determine the investment's fair market value. The Tribunal, thus, awarded to the Claimant compensation in the sum of seventy-eight million, three hundred and sixty-two thousand, four hundred and ninety-five Euros (\u20ac78,362,495) plus pre- and post-award interest.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that each party would bear its own costs based on the fact that neither side pursued its claims or defenses in bad faith, and the fact that difficult questions arose which divided the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nIn his Separate and Dissenting Opinion, Mr. Thomas agreed that there is \"dispossession\" in the sense of Article 5(2) of the BIT and in that regard, he agreed with the Majority's finding of liability and award of damages. However, finding that the dispossession was \"temporary,\" he disagreed with the finding of expropriation, arguing that a finding of discrimination and disproportionality by the Majority cannot morph \"dispossession\" into \"expropriation.\" For Mr. Thomas, the Claimant did not have a right to the favorable Hungarian tax regime in question. Hungary would be fully within its rights to do away with the tax regime. Hungary did not commit to maintaining the regime, and the Claimant certainly had no legitimate expectation otherwise. The Majority's rebuttal on this point is that Hungary could have rid itself of the tax regime on which the voucher business depended, and this would have had a devastating effect on the French issuers' investment without any right of action accruing to the French issuers. However, Hungary did not do that. Rather, it put in place a system which, in effect, transferred the French issuers' market share in the voucher business to the State in a way that was discriminatory, not for a public purpose, and disproportional to its stated purpose and which rendered the French issuers' investment worthless.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn May 27, 2019, Hungary filed the Application with ICSID pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"). The Application was accompanied by Exhibits AF-01 through AF-14 and Legal Authorities AL-01 through AL-39.\n\n19.\n\nOn May 31, 2019, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application in accordance with Arbitration Rule 50(2) and, pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed with the appointment of the *ad hoc* Committee. She further confirmed that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n20.\n\nOn July 30, 2019, in accordance with Arbitration Rules 6 and 53, the Parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted.

THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Hungary's Request for Relief**\n-----------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn its Memorial, Hungary requested that the Committee annul the Award in its entirety and order Sodexo to bear all costs of the proceeding.3 In its Reply, Hungary reiterated the request for relief that it made in its Memorial.4\n\nMemorial, para. 313.\n\nReply, para. 324.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant requested the Committee to reject the Application and order Hungary to reimburse all legal fees and costs in relation to the present annulment proceeding.5 In its Rejoinder, the Claimant requested the same request for relief.6\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 1.\n\nRejoinder, para. 268.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS AND COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn its Application, Hungary presented the following three grounds for annulment:\n\n(a) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention);\n\n(b) The Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention); and\n\n(c) The Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n45.\n\nThe Committee addresses each of these grounds separately below.\n\n**A. Manifest Excess of Powers (Article 52(1)(B))**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n46.\n\nHungary asserts that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. It makes the following three arguments in support of that assertion: (a) the Tribunal wrongly asserted its jurisdiction on the basis of Article 9(2) of the BIT; (b) the Tribunal failed to assess its jurisdiction in the light of the Declarations issued by France and Hungary on the effect of the *Achmea* Decision dated January 15 and 16, 2019 (\"**Declarations**\") despite compelling reasons to do so; and (c) the Tribunal's wrongful exercise of jurisdiction and failure to take account of the Declarations constitute a \"manifest excess of powers\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. In its Reply, Hungary addressed a procedural defense raised by the Claimant, and argued that (d) Hungary's jurisdictional challenge is not belated. A summary of these arguments is set out below.\n\n***(a) The Tribunal Wrongly Asserted Jurisdiction on the Basis of Article 9(2) of the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nFirst, Hungary asserts that the *Achmea* Decision established that the EU Treaties, the TFEU and the Treaty on the European Union (\"**TEU**\"), preclude investor-State arbitration provisions in intra-EU BITs.7 Hungary contends that the CJEU's decision in *Achmea* ruled that Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU preclude investor-State arbitration provisions in international agreements concluded between EU Member States.8\n\nMemorial, para. 74.\n\nMemorial, paras. 76-92, providing a background and summary of the CJEU's findings.\n\n48.\n\nIn Hungary's view, the CJEU's interpretation of EU Treaties in the *Achmea* Decision is authoritative and \"commands the proper interpretation of Hungary and France's international law obligations under the TFEU.\"9 According to Hungary, this authoritative nature flows from \"the *erga omnes* effect of preliminary rulings of the CJEU within the EU legal order,\" as well as the \"general principles of international law as to the deference that must be accorded to decisions of permanent jurisdictional bodies.\"10 Hungary argues that, from the text of the *Achmea* Decision, the CJEU's ruling extends beyond the scope of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.11 In this context, Hungary argues that the purpose of the CJEU ruling was the uniform interpretation of EU law and that it was drafted broadly to apply to intra-EU BITs.12 Hungary's position is that the *Achmea* Decision is moreover authoritative, with respect to the interpretation of EU law, pursuant to the provisions of Article 288 of the TFEU, which provides that any decision of an EU institution, such as the CJEU, shall be binding.13 Thus, Hungary argues that the *Achmea* Decision is binding on France and Hungary as EU Member States.14\n\nMemorial, para. 93.\n\nMemorial, para. 93.\n\nMemorial, para. 94.\n\nMemorial, paras. 95 and 97.\n\nMemorial, paras. 99-100.\n\nMemorial, para. 102.\n\n49.\n\nAs regards international law, Hungary's view is that the *Achmea* Decision establishes the correct interpretation and scope of the international law obligations undertaken by EU Member States under the EU Treaties, which preclude, and are incompatible with, investor-State arbitration provisions in international agreements concluded between EU Member States.15 With respect to the Claimant's contention that international law beyond the BIT and the ICSID Convention should play no role for purposes of determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction, Hungary asserts that this argument is \"ill-founded\" and criticizes the Claimant's reliance on *Theodoros Adamakopoulos v. Cyprus*, which Hungary says actually contradicts the Claimant's position.16 Relying on *Electrabel v. Hungary*, Hungary submits that the BIT is placed in an international law context and thus the tribunal must consider whether another law supersedes the BIT.17 Further, Hungary contends that tribunals must look in particular to the international law that applies between the State parties to the treaty at issue, as illustrated by the tribunal in *J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen v. Czech Republic*.18 In this regard, Hungary's position is that irrespective of the choice of law provided for in Article 9(3) of the BIT, the determination of jurisdiction is governed by the rules of international law applying between France and Hungary.19\n\nMemorial, para. 107.\n\nReply, para. 21, referring to Counter-Memorial, para. 129 and citing to *Theodoros Adamakopoulos, Ilektra Adamantidou, Vasileios Adamopoulos and others v. Republic of Cyprus*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/49, Decision on Jurisdiction (February 7, 2020), para. 156 (**CLA-013**).\n\nReply, paras. 24-25, citing to *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability (November 30, 2012), para. 4.193 (\"***Electrabel v. Hungary***\") (**RLA-017**).\n\nReply, para. 26, citing to *J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen, Stefan Wirtgen, Gisela Wirtgen and JSW Solar (zwei) GmbH & Co. KG v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-03, Final Award (October 11, 2017), para. 156 (\"***J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen v. Czech Republic***\") (**RLA-020**).\n\nReply, para. 27.\n\n50.\n\nSecond, Hungary asserts that Article 9(2) of the France-Hungary BIT, which constitutes an investor-State arbitration provision in an intra-EU BIT, is incompatible with France and Hungary's obligations under the EU Treaties. According to Hungary, since Article 9(2) of the BIT provides an analogous mechanism to Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, the terms of the *Achmea* Decision apply *mutatis mutandis* to Article 9(2) of the BIT.20 As a result, Hungary's position is that \"Article 9(2) of the BIT falls foul of the EU Treaties (namely, Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU and Article 19(1) of the TEU) for the same three reasons determined in the *Achmea* Decision.\"21\n\nMemorial, para. 108.\n\nMemorial, para. 109.\n\n51.\n\nHungary contends that a tribunal constituted under Article 9(2) of the BIT has to rule on possible infringements of the BIT taking into account the law in force of the concerned contracting party.22 According to Hungary, because EU law forms part of the municipal law in force in Hungary as well as part of the body of international law, it follows therefore that a tribunal constituted under Article 9(2) of the BIT may be called upon to determine disputes that relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.23 Hungary argues that, while in this particular case the Tribunal was not required to take into account any EU law provisions to resolve the dispute, under the *Achmea* Decision, \"it suffices that Article 9(2) may lead a tribunal in any dispute under the BIT to potentially take account of provisions of EU law for Article 9(2) to be determined to be incompatible with EU law.\"24\n\nMemorial, para. 110.\n\nMemorial, para. 111.\n\nMemorial, para. 112.\n\n52.\n\nHungary further asserts that the Tribunal was not a court or tribunal of an EU Member State pursuant to Article 267 of the TFEU and, in this particular case, there exists no mechanism pursuant to which the Tribunal could submit requests for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU, contrary to the case in the *Achmea* Decision.25\n\nMemorial, paras. 113-116.\n\n53.\n\nThird, Hungary submits that both France and Hungary agree that the EU Treaties preclude investor-State arbitration provisions in intra-EU BITs, and that the Declarations issued on January 15 and 16, 2019, provided a binding interpretation of the BIT by the Contracting States thus confirming the *Achmea* Decision.26\n\nMemorial, paras. 117-120.\n\n54.\n\nFourth, according to Hungary, Article 9(2) of the BIT became inapplicable upon Hungary's accession to the EU in 2004 and could not therefore form the basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction.27 Hungary's position is that the existence of an incompatibility between conflicting treaty obligations of France and Hungary must be resolved in accordance with international law, particularly in this case as the alleged incompatibility is an issue of jurisdiction, which is governed by international law.28 In Hungary's submission, by applying any of the following two international law rules (i) Article 351 of the TFEU (formerly Article 307 of the TEC \u2012 a special orientation rule) and (ii) Article 30(3) of the VCLT (reflecting customary international law), Article 9(2) of the BIT became inapplicable on May 1, 2004, when the TFEU entered into force as between France and Hungary.29\n\nMemorial, paras. 74-75;

In Hungary's submission, while the Separate and Dissenting Opinion sought to explore the applicability of Article 9(2) of the BIT, it did not take into account the Declarations and therefore, it reached a wrong conclusion.37\n\nReply, para. 69, referring to Counter-Memorial, para. 139, quoting *UP (formerly Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner) and C.D Holding Internationale v.

Argentina* and *Venezuela Holdings v.

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal's refusal to consider the Declarations in the analysis of its jurisdiction was justified because, by the time the Declarations had been brought to the Tribunal's attention, the Award had not only been finalized but had also been signed by one of the arbitrators.66\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 143.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction would not have been any different had the Tribunal considered the Declarations, as evidenced by the \"unanimous\" awards which gave no legal effect to them.67 Citing to *Magyar Farming v. Hungary*, the Claimant asserts that, \"consent was already perfected when the investor accepted Hungary's permanent offer to arbitrate.\"68 The Claimant also refers to Mr. Thomas' finding that, \"[t]herefore, I do not think that a consent given by an EU Member State to an investor of another Member State which was valid in ICSID terms at the time of the submission of the dispute to arbitration can be varied or nullified by a subsequent development in EU law which declares intra-EU BITs' arbitration clauses to be inconsistent with the EU regime.\"69 In view of the above, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal's refusal to take into account the Declarations when assessing its jurisdiction does not constitute a manifest excess of powers and the Declarations would not have altered the conclusion the Tribunal reached concerning its jurisdiction.70\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 145-146, citing to *Magyar Farming Company Ltd, Kintyre Kft and Inicia Zrt v.

In this regard, the Claimant submits that Hungary had, on separate instances in the original arbitration, raised similar arguments as it has in this annulment proceeding concerning the Tribunal's jurisdiction.77 The Claimant alleges that Hungary is using the present annulment proceeding as an appeal, by reframing the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, already pleaded in the original arbitration, hoping it may obtain a *de novo* ruling from the Committee.78\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 112.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 113.\n\n76.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that Hungary's contention that Article 9(2) of the BIT became inapplicable when Hungary acceded to the EU in 2004 should have been raised in the original proceeding.79 According to the Claimant, this issue is independent from the *Achmea* Decision and the Declarations but none of Hungary's submissions ever raised such an objection on jurisdiction.80 Therefore, the Claimant states that Hungary cannot use the annulment proceeding as a second chance to plead arguments that it failed to raise in a timely fashion in the original proceedings.81 However, the Claimant does not argue that any of Hungary's jurisdictional arguments are inadmissible in raising any jurisdictional objections before the Tribunal.82\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 115.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 115 and 116, the Claimant relies on *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v.

Specifically, the Claimant contends that the special orientation rule set out under Article 351 of the TFEU does not apply in this case because there exists no conflict between the BIT and the TFEU, as decided by the Tribunal in the Award.90 With regard to the applicability of Article 30(3) of the VCLT, the Claimant asserts that \"tribunals (including the Tribunal in the present case) have unanimously found that no incompatibility exists between the TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT, given that the former and the latter do not share the same subject matter.\"91 The Claimant relies on *Magyar Farming v. Hungary* to support its assertion that, in a more general sense, \"investment jurisprudence is consistent in holding that investment treaties do not share the [same] subject matter with the EU treaties.\"92\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136 and 137.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 138.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 138.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 138, citing to *Magyar Farming v.

As annulment is the only remedy available to set aside an award, wholly or in part, *ad hoc* committees carry a special responsibility to protect the integrity of the ICSID arbitration system and respect both parties' right to be heard and present their case in full. The Committee is conscious of and respects its mandate commensurate with this special responsibility.\n\n83.\n\nWith respect to the Applicant's claim under Article 52(1)(b) that the Tribunal incurred a \"manifest excess of power,\" the Committee must ultimately answer the following questions: (a) what is the legal standard when the alleged \"manifest excess of power\" relates to a tribunal's decision on jurisdiction; (b) did the Tribunal manifestly exceed its power when, despite the *Achmea* Decision, it assumed jurisdiction on the basis of Article 9(2) of the France-Hungary BIT; and (c) did the Tribunal manifestly exceed its power when it failed to consider the Declarations issued by France and Hungary in its decision on jurisdiction?\n\n***(a) The Relevant Legal Standard and the Meaning of \"Manifest\" in Relation to Decisions on Jurisdiction***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the scope of the ground for annulment for \"manifest excess of power\" as established under Article 52(1)(b), when the alleged \"excess of power\" concerns a tribunal's decision on jurisdiction. Whereas the Applicant argues that an excess of jurisdiction is always \"manifest\" because a tribunal either has or does not have jurisdiction, the Claimant counters that the principle of competence-competence established under Article 41(1) of the Convention implies that a tribunal's decision on jurisdiction should only be annulled when it is \"unreasonable\" or \"untenable,\" and that *ad hoc* committees have no authority to engage in a *de novo* review of the tribunal's decision on jurisdiction.\n\n85.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the Committee specifically requested the Parties to further develop their views on how the Committee should conduct its review of the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction in applying Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.98\n\nHearing Transcript Day 1, pp. 118-119.\n\n86.\n\nThe Applicant insisted that there is \"no in between\" in matters of jurisdiction and that the requirement of \"manifest\" is always satisfied in case of a jurisdiction excess of powers. It also contended that, in this case, the Tribunal's overreach is evident because it is clear that the Tribunal exceeded its power by disregarding the *Achmea* Decision and the Declarations; as well as serious, because consent forms the cornerstone of international arbitration.99\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, pp. 9-10.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant on the other hand expressed the view that the notion that a Tribunal either has or does not have jurisdiction is slightly simplistic, and that a *de novo* review of jurisdictional matters is not what the drafters of the ICSID Convention had in mind.100 It outlined two different methodological approaches adopted by previous *ad hoc* committees: the so-called two-step approach under which a committee must first determine whether there has been an excess of power, and if so, whether the excess of power was manifest; and the *prima facie* approach under which the committee verifies whether there is anything manifestly or obviously wrong in the decision on jurisdiction, without engaging in its own full analysis. The Claimant suggests that a *prima facie* approach is more in line with the overall spirit of the ICSID Convention and the word \"manifest\" as used in the ICSID Convention.101\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, p. 37.\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, pp. 39-40.\n\n88.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the position put forward by Claimant.\n\n89.\n\nThe history of the ICSID Convention and numerous decisions by *ad hoc* committees make clear that a tribunal may incur an excess of power when it exceeds the mandate given to it by the parties, in particular, by going beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement and deciding on issues that were not submitted to it, and by failing to apply the proper law agreed on by the parties.102 Thus, a manifest excess of power may occur both at the jurisdiction and at the merits stage.\n\nICSID, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (May 5, 2016), paras. 19-21.\n\n90.\n\nOf all the grounds for annulment, \"manifest excess of power\" is most prone to invite a *de novo* review of the facts and the law, to determine whether the tribunal did or did not have jurisdiction, or whether its decision is congruent with the applicable law. It is for this reason that the drafters of the Convention insisted that the excess of powers be \"manifest.\" Not just any excess of power should result in annulment, only those excesses that are obvious, clear and easily identifiable, and do not require complex interpretations of the award to be discerned.103\n\n*See* ICSID, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (May 5, 2016), para. 83, footnotes 153 and 154 for references to cases.\n\n91.\n\nThe Applicant refers to the history of the ICSID Convention, in particular the drafters' understanding that a decision on the merits by a tribunal that lacks jurisdiction is an obvious example of an excess of powers. However, that does not mean that such excess of power need not be \"manifest,\" as expressly required under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. As pointed out by the Claimant, the wording of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention makes no distinction between a tribunal's decision on jurisdiction or on the merits in this respect.\n\n92.\n\nThe Committee finds that this oversimplifies the legitimate disagreement that may exist on complex factual and normative considerations that affect a tribunal's jurisdiction. The decision on such matters falls to the tribunal, as established under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n93.\n\nIndeed, considering that the tribunal is the judge of its own competence, the \"manifest\" requirement gains particular relevance in the context of jurisdiction. An *ad hoc* committee must be mindful of and, therefore, respect the tribunal's margin of appreciation, rather than undertake a *de novo* evaluation of the facts and law supporting the tribunal's jurisdiction. It need only be satisfied that the decision on jurisdiction is clearly neither unreasonable nor untenable.104 A debatable solution is not subject to annulment since the excess of powers would not then be \"manifest.\"105\n\n*Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Peru, S.A. (also known as Industria Nacional de Alimentos, A.S. and Indalsa Per\u00fa S.A.) v. Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Decision on Annulment (September 5, 2007), para. 112; *Alapli Elektrik v.

Peru***\") (**CLA-29**).\n\n94.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimant that the *prima facie* approach to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is preferable, precisely to resist the temptation to first engage in a full review of the facts and the law, as is inherent in the two-step approach. The Committee will therefore take one step back and determine whether the decision reached by the Tribunal is *prima facie* so unreasonable or untenable that it constitutes a \"manifest excess of power\" in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(b) The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction Does Not Constitute a Manifest Excess of Power***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Applicant claims that the Tribunal wrongly asserted jurisdiction on the basis of Article 9(2) of the France-Hungary BIT following the CJEU's decision in the *Achmea* case, and that its wrongful exercise of jurisdiction is, by that same token, \"manifest.\" As explained above, the Committee rejects the latter since the \"manifest\" requirement must be satisfied independently, albeit on the basis of a *prima facie* review.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the legal standard set out in the previous section, the Committee must determine whether the Tribunal's decision that the *Achmea* Decision does not deprive it of jurisdiction under Article 9(2) of the France-Hungary BIT is so unreasonable or untenable that it amounts to a \"manifest excess of power.\"\n\n97.\n\nThe Committee takes note that not a single ICSID tribunal thus far has held that the *Achmea* Decision renders null and void the arbitration clause contained in intra-EU BITs, whether retroactively (upon accession of both States to the EU) or proactively (upon the issuance of the *Achmea* Decision). As the Claimant pointed out during the Hearing, this renders the Applicant's case \"an uphill battle.\"106 But to declare it a run race for that reason only would not do justice to the Applicant's understandable sense of frustration of history simply repeating itself.107\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, pp. 40-41.\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, p. 4.\n\n98.\n\nThe Committee will therefore engage in its own review of whether the *Achmea* Decision renders the Tribunal's decision on its jurisdiction under the France-Hungary BIT so untenable that it must be annulled. To that end, the following uncontroversial facts are relevant:\n\n\u2022 The *Achmea* Decision was issued by the CJEU upon request of the German Federal Court, in the context of a procedure in German courts to set aside an UNCITRAL arbitration award decided under the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.\n\n\u2022 The Netherlands-Slovakia BIT arbitration clause specifically required the arbitral tribunal to decide, among others, on the basis of \"the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned\" (Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT).\n\n\u2022 The CJEU determined that the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT \"may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital,\" and that \"by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law.\"\n\n\u2022 The CJEU ruled that \"Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic [\u2026].\"\n\n\u2022 Article 267 of the TFEU establishes the CJEU's jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings of the interpretation of EU Treaties and on the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices, or agencies of the Union. Article 344 of the TFEU provides that \"Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.\"\n\n99.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal was whether the CJEU's ruling on Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT deprives the Tribunal of its jurisdiction, based on Article 9 of a different intra-EU BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n100.\n\nThis question raises complex substantive and procedural issues, as it involves the interaction between two different legal systems: the EU legal system that is binding upon EU Member States, and the ICSID arbitration system that is created by a multilateral treaty (the ICSID Convention). Jurisdiction within the ICSID arbitration system has a dual basis in the ICSID Convention in conjunction with a variety of legal instruments, including intra-European BITs. Additional complexity is added by the fact that the ICSID arbitration system creates rights for third parties not States, who may have relied on their access to ICSID arbitration when making their foreign investment.\n\n101.\n\nBoth systems have their own means of resolving disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the legal instruments on which they are based. The ICSID arbitration system is specifically designed as a self-contained and autonomous arbitration system for disputes between foreign investors and States. It is not evident that a decision by the CJEU on the interpretation of an intra-EU BIT is binding on an ICSID tribunal whose jurisdiction is based on that same BIT. In the words of the Separate and Dissenting Opinion, \"nothing in the Convention recognizes that a judgment of a court having jurisdiction within an ICSID Contracting State that has already given its consent to ICSID arbitration can undo such an arbitration agreement, even if that court plays a supranational role within a regional legal system.\"108\n\nSeparate and Dissenting Opinion of J.C. Thomas QC (January 19, 2019), para. 66 (**RLA-4**).\n\n102.\n\nHungary also claims that Article 9 of the BIT became inapplicable long before the *Achmea* Decision, upon Hungary's accession to the EU on May 1, 2004, by virtue of Article 351 of the TFEU. The Committee takes note that the Claimant questions the timeliness of the Applicant's objection to jurisdiction based on this argument, which was not raised before the Tribunal, but ultimately does not oppose its admissibility in the annulment procedure.\n\n103.\n\nArticle 351 of the TFEU provides that Member States shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate incompatibilities between agreements concluded before January 1, 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession, and the EU Treaties. In the view of the Committee, this provision does not have the claimed automatic effect of making Article 9 of the France-Hungary BIT inapplicable. At most, it called for EU Member States to actively withdraw their consent to investment arbitration in intra-EU BITs, which they did not do, and certainly not before the *Achmea* Decision.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant relied on Hungary's consent to ICSID arbitration as expressed in Article 9 of the France-Hungary BIT, long before the *Achmea* Decision was issued. Depriving the Claimant retroactively of its right to arbitration based on the ICSID Convention, as a consequence of a decision by the CJEU, is not the evidently correct decision, in the view of the Committee.\n\n105.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issues raised by the *Achmea* Decision, on which sophisticated jurists may have different opinions, it is clear to the Committee that the Tribunal's decision to assume jurisdiction by virtue of Article 9 of the France-Hungary BIT, despite the *Achmea* Decision, is not *prima facie* so unreasonable or untenable that it constitutes a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Failure to Consider the Declarations Does Not Constitute a Manifest Excess of Power***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Applicant also claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power because it did not take into consideration the Declarations issued by France and Hungary which, according to the Applicant, provide a binding interpretation of the France-Hungary BIT confirming the *Achmea* Decision and constitute a new ground for objection to jurisdiction.\n\n107.\n\nThe Declarations affirm, after citing the CJEU ruling in the *Achmea* Decision, that: \"Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States. As a consequence, all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable. [\u2026] An arbitral tribunal established on the basis of investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate by the member State party to the underlying bilateral investment Treaty.\"109\n\nDeclaration of the Member States of January 15, 2019 on the Legal Consequences of the *Achmea* Judgment and on Investment Protection, January 15, 2019 (**AL-02**) and Decla ration of the Representative of the Government of Hungary of January 16, 2019 on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union, January 16, 2019 (**AL-03**).\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Declarations would not have changed the Tribunal's decision and relies on the Separate and Dissenting Opinion, which states that the consent to arbitrate given by an EU State to a foreign investor that was valid at the time of the submission of the dispute to arbitration cannot be varied or nullified by subsequent developments in European law.\n\n109.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimant that the Declarations do not add new elements to the discussion on jurisdiction raised by the *Achmea* Decision. State declarations are no more binding on ICSID tribunals than decisions by the CJEU, nor is it evident that a State can unilaterally withdraw its consent to ICSID arbitration when that consent has previously been relied on by a foreign investor who submitted a dispute to arbitration.110 Furthermore, and in addition to the tension between these Declarations and subsequent attempts by EU Member States to regulate the impact of the *Achmea* Decision, the precise status of these Declarations is unclear. Different versions exist, the mandate of the signatories is not apparent, and the Declarations do not bear the signatures of (or representatives of) all EU Member States. As these are highly debatable issues, the Committee cannot find that the Tribunal's decision to assert jurisdiction despite the Declarations is *prima facie* so unreasonable or untenable that it qualifies as a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b).\n\nICSID Convention, Article 25(1), 2nd sentence.\n\n110.\n\nThe Applicant's claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power by assuming jurisdiction under Article 9 of the France-Hungary BIT, despite the CJEU's *Achmea* Decision and the Declarations of Hungary and other EU States, is therefore rejected.\n\n111.\n\nThe Applicant raises the separate question whether the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, in particular the Applicant's right to be heard, by not reopening the procedure to consider the Declarations. This will be discussed in the next section.\n\n**B. Serious Departure From a Fundamental Rule of Procedure (Article 52(1)(D))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe second ground for annulment Hungary raises is that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. Hungary contends that the Tribunal (a) departed from the requirement to assess its jurisdiction and breached Hungary's right to be heard by failing to take account of the Declarations issued by France and Hungary; (b) departed from the formal and substantive requirements that any award must conform to by failing to mention and provide reasons in the Award for its prior decision refusing to take account of the Declarations; (c) departed from the principle of equal treatment of the Parties by deciding to introduce the *Edenred* and *UP* Awards in the proceedings and relying on their reasoning for certain of the Tribunal's findings; and that (d) the above departures from a rule of procedure were serious. The section below sets out a summary of Hungary's arguments in this regard.\n\n***(a) The Tribunal Departed from the Principle to Scrutinize its Jurisdiction and Hungary's Right to Be Heard***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe first argument that Hungary makes is that the obligation to scrutinize the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the right to be heard are fundamental rules of procedure. It argues that the phrase \"a fundamental rule of procedure\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention \"encompasses any procedural rule concerned with the integrity and fairness of the proceeding.\"111\n\nMemorial, para. 174, referring to Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (May 5, 2016), para. 98 (**RLA-35**) and *Tulip Real Estate Investment and Development Netherlands B.V.* v. *Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on Annulment (December 30, 2015), para. 71 (\"***Tulip v.

Guatemala***\") (**RLA-37**).\n\n114.\n\nIn Hungary's submission, past *ad hoc* committees have identified four principles as constituting fundamental rules of procedure: (i) equal treatment of the parties; (ii) the right to be heard; (iii) an independent and impartial tribunal; and (iv) the proper handling of evidence and allocation of the burden of proof.112 Moreover, Hungary submits that the principle of consent, on which the jurisdictional requirements for ICSID arbitration are based, is recognized as a fundamental rule of procedure.113 Following on from this assertion, Hungary's position is that a tribunal's failure to scrutinize its jurisdiction and consider any jurisdictional objection under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention justifies the annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.114 Hungary further submits that the right to be heard is also accepted as a fundamental rule of procedure,115 and that, if a tribunal adopts a position or proceeds in a manner that prevents one of the parties to present fully its case, then this principle is breached.116\n\nMemorial, para. 175, referring to *Joseph C.

According to Hungary, the Tribunal had an obligation to scrutinize the basis for its jurisdiction, including an obligation to reopen the proceedings with respect to the Declarations.117\n\nMemorial, para. 179.\n\n116.\n\nHungary states that on January 17, 2019 it notified the Tribunal of the Declarations and sought the reopening of the proceedings in accordance with Rule 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules, \"for the limited purpose of considering the significance of the Declarations regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"118 Hungary submits that it complied with the Arbitration Rule 38(2) requirements since the Declarations were a subsequent agreement between France and Hungary regarding the interpretation of the BIT, and hence a \"decisive factor\" for the Tribunal's assessment of its jurisdiction and given that they were issued after the closure of the proceedings they also qualified as \"new.\"119 It is Hungary's submission that by the time the Declarations were issued, the Award had only been signed by one of the arbitrators, Mr. Carlevaris, on January 10, 2019.120 Therefore, Hungary contends that when it requested the consideration of the Declarations for the Tribunal's jurisdiction on January 17, 2019, the Tribunal was still in control of the Award and had the opportunity to make changes to it.121 In Hungary's view, an award has not been \"rendered\" until it is signed by all the members of the tribunal and transmitted to the Secretary-General for authentication and dispatch to the parties.122\n\nMemorial, para. 181.\n\nMemorial, para. 183, referring to Hungary's Request to the Tribunal for the Reopening of the Proceedings (January 17, 2019) (**R-11**).\n\nMemorial, para. 184.\n\nMemorial, para. 184.\n\nMemorial, para. 184, referring to Schreuer, Commentary, Article 51, para. 21 (**RLA-40**).\n\n117.\n\nHungary claims that on January 22, 2019, the Tribunal denied the request to reopen the proceedings and consider the Declarations for assessing jurisdiction. The Tribunal offered no analysis of Arbitration Rule 38(2) but proceeded to issue the Award on January 28, 2019.123 The point Hungary advances here is that Rule 38(2) is permissive in nature because of the inclusion of the word \"may.\"124 Relying on the tribunal's findings in *Micula v. Romania*, Hungary asserts that a tribunal not only has the power but the obligation to assess its jurisdiction throughout the proceedings even *sua sponte*, upon the existence of compelling reasons to do so.125\n\nMemorial, paras. 185-186.\n\nMemorial, para. 187.\n\nMemorial, para. 189, citing to *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C.

Article 48 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\"131 Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules specifies the information to be included in an award, which includes, among others (i) \"a summary of the proceeding\" (ii) \"a statement of the facts as found by the Tribunal\" (iii) \"the submissions of the parties\" and (iv) \"the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based.\"132 Thus, in Hungary's submission, an award that fails to conform to Article 48 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules warrants an annulment.133\n\nMemorial, para. 204, referring to Schreuer, Commentary, Article 48, para. 23 (**RLA-40**).\n\nMemorial, para. 205.\n\nMemorial, para. 206.\n\nMemorial, para. 207.\n\n121.\n\nSecond, Hungary submits that the Tribunal's failure to mention and provide reasons in the Award for the decision rejecting the Declarations infringed upon the formal and substantive requirements of an award. Hungary argues that the Tribunal's decision, conveyed by email from the Secretary of the Tribunal, only stated that the Tribunal had decided to deny Hungary's request \"as coming too late in the process, given [the] context of Rule 38\" without giving any reasons.134 Further, Hungary states that the Award did not even mention Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings nor provide reasons for denying the request.135\n\nMemorial, para. 209, quoting from the Tribunal Secretary's email to the Parties, concerning Hungary's Request to Reopen the Proceedings (January 22, 2019) (**R-13**).\n\nMemorial, para. 210.\n\n122.\n\nIn Hungary's view, the Declarations were \"new evidence\" which satisfied the Rule 38 criteria of being a \"decisive factor\" for consideration of Hungary's objection to jurisdiction.136 Thus, Hungary contends that even if the Tribunal rejected the request to reopen the proceedings, the \"very fact of Hungary seeking the admission of the Declarations constituted (i) an important procedural step invoked in the arbitration, (ii) a significant fact of fundamental relevance to the assessment of the *Achmea* objection, and (iii) [justified] brief written submissions on the importance of the Declarations by Hungary.\"137\n\nMemorial, para. 211.\n\nMemorial, para. 211.\n\n123.\n\nHungary contends that the Tribunal's omission to refer to the request to reopen the proceeding and the Tribunal's decision as a procedural step in the Award is a departure from Article 48(3) the ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules.138 In particular, Hungary asserts that the Award is in breach of the requirements of Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules, namely that an award must contain (i) \"a summary of the proceeding\" (ii) \"the submissions of the parties\" and (iii) \"the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it,\" as it failed to provide a faithful summary of the procedural history of the case and the submissions of the Parties.139\n\nMemorial, para. 212.\n\nMemorial, para. 213.\n\n124.\n\nIn relation to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, Hungary submits that the Award did not conform to the requirements set out therein as, \"it fails to deal with a crucial question submitted to the Tribunal and fails to provide the reasons upon which it is based concerning this particular question.\"140 In Hungary's submission, Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention has been interpreted to mean that an award shall be a final, comprehensive act of the tribunal incorporating every relevant pre-award decision of the tribunal that had been rendered until that point in the proceeding.141 To support this assertion, Hungary relies on the findings of the tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador* and *TANESCO v. Tanzania*.142 Further, Hungary contends that a tribunal's decision on a party's request to reopen the proceeding or revisit a prior decision based on Arbitration Rule 38 has been dealt with comprehensively in the final award in all publicly available awards.143 Hungary cites the following examples of cases in which the tribunal considered a request to reopen the proceedings: *EDF v. Romania*, *Masdar v. Spain* and *Supervisi\u00f3n v. Costa Rica*.144\n\nMemorial, para. 215.\n\nMemorial, para. 216.\n\nMemorial, paras. 217-218, citing to *Burlington Resources Inc. v.

Turkey*, para. 146 (**RLA-36**). Hungary also refers to W. Michael Reisman, James Richard Crawford, et al. (eds), Foreign Investment Disputes: Cases, Materials and Commentary, Kluwer Law International (2nd ed., 2014), p. 1086 (**RLA-55**) and Campbell McLachlan, Equality of Parties before International Investment Tribunals, Rapport of the Institut de Droit International, Eighteenth Commission (2018), para. 52 (**RLA-56**).\n\nMemorial, para. 236.\n\n128.\n\nHungary asserts that, after the hearing on the merits held on May 2 to 4, 2017, the Tribunal decided to introduce the *Edenred* award to the record *sua sponte*, despite Hungary's objections.151 It argues that the Tribunal failed to invite the Parties to comment on the reasons for and against introducing the *Edenred* award, which was not publicly available, before directing Hungary to submit the award in question by letter dated June 26, 2017.152 According to Hungary, the Tribunal ignored the concerns expressed in Hungary's letter dated June 15, 2017, more specifically that the *Edenred* award could improperly influence the Tribunal.153 Hungary submits that this is because the *Edenred* award, as opposed to any other general investment arbitration case award, concerned identical claims based on the same law as that at issue in the present proceeding save for distinct investor, factual issues, evidentiary record and legal analyses.154 Therefore, Hungary reminded the Tribunal that it had a right to have its case adjudicated by the Tribunal based only on the arguments raised in this proceeding without influence from any other proceedings.155 Another concern Hungary expressed was that the equality and fairness of the proceedings would be undermined to its detriment, if the Tribunal placed any reliance on the determinations made by the *Edenred* tribunal.156 Hungary similarly expressed concerns regarding the equality and fairness of the proceedings when the Tribunal directed the production of the *UP* Award on October 19, 2018, but, it contends, the Tribunal ignored them.157\n\nMemorial, para. 237. *See also* footnote 176.\n\nMemorial, para. 238.\n\nMemorial, para. 239.\n\nMemorial, para. 239.\n\nMemorial, para. 240.\n\nMemorial, para. 243.\n\nMemorial, para. 246.\n\n129.\n\nConsequently, Hungary submits that the admission of these awards detrimentally affected its position, particularly because it had to challenge not only the Claimant's arguments in this proceeding but also those advanced by *Edenred* and *UP*.158 With reference to witness testimony, Hungary argues that the awards also contained assessments of the same fact and expert witnesses who also testified on behalf of Hungary in this arbitration, thus, conclusions could be drawn based on a comparison of their witness testimony across the three cases.159 Hungary notes that neither the Claimant nor its witnesses were subject to the same degree of scrutiny.160\n\nMemorial, paras. 248-249.\n\nMemorial, para. 250.\n\nMemorial, para. 251.\n\n130.\n\nAccording to Hungary, the Tribunal incorrectly relied on the *Edenred* and *UP* awards without having access to the record of the proceedings and without affording Hungary's witnesses in this proceeding the opportunity to respond to the issues raised in the awards.161 Hungary identifies four findings in the Award in this proceeding which were outcome-determinative issues on liability that the Tribunal apparently borrowed extensively from the *Edenred* and *UP* Awards: (i) the finding that the existence of Claimant's shares in SPH absent any additional vested right is sufficient (ii) the finding that the 2012 reforms were discriminatory against foreign voucher issuers; (iii) the confirmation of the Tribunal's finding that the 2012 reforms were not made for a public purpose for an expropriation claim; and (iv) the Tribunal's finding that its overall conclusion on liability was in \"full consistency\" with the *Edenred* and *UP* tribunals' findings.162\n\nMemorial, para. 253.\n\nMemorial, para. 255.\n\n131.\n\nHungary submits that despite the Tribunal claiming that it did not rely on the *Edenred* and *UP* awards, it did in fact place significant emphasis on these awards in support of its findings.163 As a result, Hungary submits that it suffered unequal treatment as against the Claimant and that the *Edenred* and *UP* awards were \"effectively determinative of the outcome of the case on a number of issues.\"164\n\nMemorial, para. 256.\n\nMemorial, para. 257.\n\n***(d) The Tribunal's Departure Is Serious***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nReferring to previous *ad hoc* committee decisions, Hungary submits that the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is \"serious\" for the purposes of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention if the violation is substantial and deprives a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.165 Therefore, Hungary argues that an applicant need not prove that the violation of the rule of procedure was decisive for the outcome or that it would have won the case had the rule been applied.166 Hungary's position is that it is sufficient to show that observing the rule could potentially cause the tribunal to render an award that is substantially different from what it actually decided.167\n\nMemorial, para. 258, referring to *MINE v.

Turkey,* para. 78 (**RLA-36**).\n\n133.\n\nHungary submits that it has been confirmed by past *ad hoc* committees that the determination of whether there has been a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is fact specific and should be decided on a case by case basis.168 Hungary submits that in the present case, the Tribunal's departure from the fundamental principles of (i) the duty to scrutinize its jurisdiction; (ii) the right to be heard; (iii) the formal and substantive requirements of an award; and (iv) the equal treatment of the parties was decisive for the outcome of the proceedings.169 Specifically, Hungary contends that (i) the Tribunal's failure to reopen the proceedings to assess the Declarations; (ii) the Tribunal's failure to even mention and provide reasons for denying Hungary's request for the reopening of the proceedings are serious departures from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (iii) the *Edenred* award improperly affected the Tribunal's own findings and conclusions on the merits.170\n\nMemorial, para. 260, referring to Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (May 5, 2016), para. 83 (**RLA-35**); *Malicorp Limited v.

Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimant's arguments on the second ground for annulment address the following matters: (a) the relevant legal standard; (b) the Tribunal did not seriously breach Hungary's right to be heard by refusing to take into account the Declarations; (c) the Tribunal did not seriously depart from the formal and substantive requirements that any award must conform to; and (d) the Tribunal did not seriously depart from the principle of equal treatment by deciding to introduce the *Edenred* and *UP* awards and by relying on them.\n\n***(a) The Relevant Legal Standard***\n-------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimant submits that for an award to be annulled under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, there must have been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.172 Relying on the finding of the *ad hoc* committee in *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela*, the Claimant argues that the rule of procedure must be a fundamental one and the Committee should first establish whether a fundamental rule of procedure is at stake, whether it has been breached and, if so, whether the Tribunal's departure was so serious that it could have affected the outcome of the case.173\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 152; Rejoinder, para. 134.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 153, citing to *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela*, para. 129 (**RLA-34**).\n\n137.\n\nWith respect to the requirement that the rule of procedure be a fundamental one, the Claimant submits that it has been consistently found that \"[t]he fundamental rules of procedure that might furnish a ground for annulment, if violated, would be restricted to the principles of natural justice. In other words, fundamental rules of procedure are principles that are essential to a fair hearing.\"174\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 154, citing to *Tulip v. Turkey*, para. 71 (**RLA-36**).\n\n138.\n\nIn relation to the \"seriousness\" of the departure, the Claimant concurs with Hungary's position that the tribunal's departure from a fundamental rule of procedure will be deemed serious \"if the violation is substantial and deprives a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide\" and if such violation \"produced a material impact on the award.\"175\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 155, referring to Memorial, para. 258 and citing to *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, para. 99 (**RLA-59**).\n\n***(b) The Tribunal Did Not Seriously Breach Hungary's Right to be Heard by Refusing to Take into Account the Declarations***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimant's position is that there has been no breach of a fundamental rule of procedure in the present case as the Tribunal did not depart from the right to be heard by refusing to consider the Declarations pursuant to Rule 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules.176 In the Claimant's submission, even if there was such a departure, Hungary has failed to establish its seriousness.177\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 157.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 157.\n\n140.\n\nFirst, the Claimant disagrees with Hungary's contention that by \"preventing Hungary from presenting its case fully, and by failing to assess its jurisdiction in light of the Declarations, the Tribunal violated Hungary's right to be heard.\"178 While Claimant agrees with Hungary's argument that each party should be afforded the opportunity \"to present fully its case\" it argues that such opportunity is not unlimited.179 In its assessment, the Claimant submits that \"Hungary's right to be heard \u2013 and any limitations thereto by the Tribunal \u2013 should be assessed in light of Rule 38(2) and of the considerations guiding the Tribunal's refusal to re-open the proceedings.\"180\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 158.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 159, citing to *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Decision on An nulm ent (March 18, 2019), para. 178 (**CLA-019**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 160.\n\n141.\n\nWith regard to the Tribunal's alleged failure to assess its jurisdiction, the Claimant agrees with Hungary that the Tribunal has an obligation to assess its jurisdiction and address any belated jurisdictional objections throughout the proceedings, however, the Claimant argues that this obligation does not necessarily survive the closure of the proceedings.181 In this regard, the Claimant notes that in the present case, the Tribunal complied with its duty to assess its jurisdiction by considering Hungary's jurisdictional objections raised after the issuance of the *Achmea* Decision and by also allowing the EC to file an *amicus curiae* brief and by allowing comments from the Parties.182 Thus, the Claimant submits that throughout the proceedings and up until their closure thereof, the Tribunal never failed to hear Hungary's objections or limit Hungary's rights to be heard.183\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 162-163, citing to *AIG v. Kazakhstan*, para. 9.2 (**RLA-47**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 164-165.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 166.\n\n142.\n\nIn terms of the provisions of Rule 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Claimant argues that the use of the words \"exceptionally, the Tribunal may\" suggests that the Tribunal has discretion in deciding to reopen or not to reopen the proceeding.184 Therefore, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal's decision of January 22, 2019 not to reopen the proceedings was derived from the Tribunal's discretionary powers and thus does not constitute a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.185\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 168\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 169.\n\n143.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that if the Committee were to consider that the Tribunal's exercise of its discretionary power under Rule 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules did constitute a departure from Hungary's right to be heard, such departure was not serious enough to justify annulment of the Award.186 According to the Claimant, Hungary has not demonstrated how the Declarations would have affected the outcome of the case whereas the Claimant has established that the few cases that have considered the Declarations found them to have no impact on the tribunals' jurisdiction.187\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 170; Rejoinder, para. 164.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 172; Rejoinder, para. 166.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal Did Not Seriously Depart from the Formal and Substantive Requirements that Any Award Must Conform to***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with Hungary's position that the Tribunal's failure to even mention Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings, as well as the alleged failure to provide reasons in the Award, are both serious departures from a fundamental rule of procedure.188 According to the Claimant, \"unlike the right to be heard, the principle that an award must conform to the requirements of form and substance of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention is not 'essential to a fair hearing' and is therefore not a 'fundamental rule of procedure.'\"189 The Claimant's position is that only rules of natural justice, essential to a fair hearing, and not just any rule, are considered fundamental rules of procedure in the context of annulment proceedings.190 To support this assertion, the Claimant argues that past *ad hoc* committees have found that a simple violation of rules, such as Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules would not by itself amount to a ground for annulment.191\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 175.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 177.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 179, referring to *El Paso Energy International Company v.

According to the Claimant, the request to reopen the proceedings does not fall within the meaning of \"every question submitted to the Tribunal.\"193 The Claimant submits that, when interpreted strictly, the word \"question\" means \"heads of claim\" or \"requests for relief.\"194 Therefore, the Claimant asserts that Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention does not apply to requests such as the one submitted by Hungary.195\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 184.\n\nCounter-Memoria l, para. 184, referring to J.

Spain* to illustrate this point.200\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 191-192, citing to *9REN Holding S.a.r.l v.

The Claimant submits that it is widely accepted that tribunals enjoy discretionary power to order the production of documents on their own motion and at any stage of the proceedings, and relies on the findings of the *ad hoc* committees in *Azurix v. Argentina* and *Daimler v. Argentina* to support this assertion.201 With regard to Hungary's assertion that the Parties were not invited to comment on the introduction of the awards, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal \"explicitly\" sought the Parties' views on this issue during the Hearing in the original arbitration.202\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 198-200, citing to *Azurix v. Argentina*, para. 208 (**CLA-005**); *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment (January 7, 2015), para. 295 (**CLA-025**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 201-203, referring to Hearing Transcript in Arbitration Proceeding, Day 3 (May 4, 2017) (**R-2**); Rejoinder, para. 198.\n\n152.\n\nSecond, contrary to Hungary's assertion, the Claimant submits that Hungary was not treated unequally in these proceedings. According to the Claimant, it was actually Hungary that benefited from this position because it used the same legal team for the three arbitrations, despite arguing that it had to defend not only its position but the arguments advanced by *Edenred* and *UP*.203\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 206; Rejoinder, para. 206.\n\n153.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that in any event, the Tribunal was not improperly influenced by the *Edenred* and *UP* awards. According to the Claimant, the majority of the Parties' submissions were made before the introduction of the two awards and therefore the Tribunal had the opportunity to hear from the Parties on issues of liability beforehand.204 Moreover, the Claimant contends that from a simple reading of the Award, the Tribunal relied exclusively on the Parties' submissions.205 In particular, the Claimant identifies that the Tribunal's analysis of Hungary's liability solely addresses the Parties' arguments and has not been improperly influenced by either the *Edenred* or the *UP* awards.206 In the Claimant's view, mere references to the awards cannot amount to a serious departure from the principle of equal treatment, \"as this would otherwise lead to the absurd conclusion that any referral to past decisions involving identical claims and legal bases could lead to annulment of an award.\"207 Relying on *AES v. Argentina*, the Claimant submits that referral to past decisions may be both relevant and useful, and is consistent with the practice of ICSID tribunals to refer *sua sponte* to other cases involving the same BITs or similar circumstances.208\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 212.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 213.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 215.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 216.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 217-219, citing to *AES Corporation v.

However, throughout their discussion, the Parties disagree on what should be considered a \"fundamental rule of procedure.\"\n\n156.\n\nIt is uncontroversial that a fundamental rule of procedure includes the equal treatment of the parties, the right to be heard and the right to an independent and impartial tribunal. The proper handling of evidence and allocation of the burden of proof has also been accepted as a fundamental rule of procedure.209\n\nICSID, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (May 5, 2016), para. 99.\n\n157.\n\nIn addition, the Applicant claims that the principle of consent is a fundamental rule of procedure and that any jurisdictional objection regardless of the time of submission must therefore be scrutinized. To this, the Claimant objects that the closure of the proceeding sets a time limit on the tribunal's duties in this respect.\n\n158.\n\nThe principle of consent is no doubt the cornerstone of arbitration. The jurisdictional phase of arbitration is designed to ensure that the conditions of consent have been met.\n\n159.\n\nThe Committee does not find it helpful to frame the principle of consent as a fundamental rule of procedure, the only purpose of which seems to be to bring it under the scope of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Impregilo*, relied on by the Applicant in this context, supports the Committee's view. The *ad hoc* committee in *Impregilo* found that Argentina's claim under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention was, in fact, a disagreement with certain aspects of the tribunal's decision on jurisdiction and could not therefore constitute a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure.210\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina*, paras. 170-171 (**RLA-39**).\n\n160.\n\nNor does the Committee find it necessary to transform the principle of consent into a fundamental rule of procedure. The Applicant's concerns with respect to the Tribunal's decision not to reopen the procedure following the Declarations can be adequately and should be analyzed under the principle of the right to be heard.\n\n161.\n\nThe Applicant also claims that the requirements set forth in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1) constitute fundamental rules of procedure. Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based,\" whereas Arbitration Rule 47(1) specifies, among others, that an award must contain a summary of the proceeding, the submissions of the parties and the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it. To this, the Claimant objects that Arbitration Rule 47(1) is not a fundamental rule of procedure, essential to a fair hearing.\n\n162.\n\nThe Committee starts its analysis by recognizing that Article 48 of the ICSID Convention establishes the duty of the tribunal to state the reasons upon which its decisions are based. Failure to comply with this duty is cause for annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Article 48 of the ICSID Convention also establishes that the award shall deal with every question submitted to the tribunal. There is no equivalent ground for annulment that is specifically related to this requirement.\n\n163.\n\nThe failure to address every question submitted to the tribunal has on different occasions been invoked as cause for annulment on the grounds of manifest excess of power, serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and failure to state reasons.211 The Committee has no principled objection to the Applicant's decision to frame the Tribunal's failure to address in the award the Applicant's request to reopen the proceedings as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nSchreuer, Commentary, Article 52, para. 426 (**RLA-40**).\n\n164.\n\nDifferent is the situation with respect to the specific requirements set out under Arbitration Rule 47(1). These include the identification of the parties and their counsel, the names of the members of the tribunal, the dates and places of the sittings of the tribunal, a summary of the proceeding, a statement of the facts and submissions of the parties, the \"decision of the tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based\" in direct allusion to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, and any decision of the tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding. The majority of these requirements are of a practical and even didactic nature, meant to guide the drafting process and ensure the identification, intelligibility, and completeness of the award. With the exception of the requirement that the tribunal must decide, and on a reasoned basis, on every question submitted to it, these are not procedural rules \"concerned with the fairness and integrity of the proceedings.\"212\n\nMemorial, para. 174.\n\n165.\n\nAs the Applicant has pointed out, the summary of the proceedings and the parties' submissions may provide useful evidence of whether the parties were treated equally and fairly during the proceedings, for instance, if no reference at all is made in the award to the arguments of one of the parties.213 Thus, the Committee is open to the possibility that the Tribunal's failure to comply with Arbitration Rule 47(1) is indicative of a departure of a fundamental rule of procedure such as the right to be heard. But that does not mean that the requirements established under Arbitration Rule 47(1) themselves constitute fundamental rules of procedure.\n\nReply, para. 201.\n\n166.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Committee turns to the specific arguments raised by the Applicant under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(b) The Tribunal Did Not Seriously Depart from the Right to be Heard by Refusing to Take into Account the Declarations after the Closure of the Proceeding***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nBoth Parties acknowledge that the Tribunal has discretionary power to reopen the procedure under Arbitration Rule 38(2).214 Both Parties also agree that the Tribunal's discretion is not unlimited and may result in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.215 However, they disagree on whether the Tribunal's decision not to reopen the proceeding violated the Applicant's right to be heard. They also disagree on whether the Tribunal's given reason for refusing the Applicant's request (\"as coming too late in the process, given [the] context of Rule 38\") is valid in this respect.\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript Day 2, p. 13 for the Applicant's acknowledgment of this point.\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript Day 2, p. 43 for the Claimant's acknowledgment of this point.\n\n168.\n\nArbitration Rule 38(2) provides as follows: \"Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.\"\n\n169.\n\nOn a *prima facie* reading, the decision to reopen the proceeding is exceptional and requires specific and challenging grounds: namely that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature so as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points. The words \"decisive\" and \"vital need\" strongly reinforce the exceptional nature of the measure. The party requesting the reopening of the proceeding has the burden of proving that these requirements have been met.\n\n170.\n\nThe Committee has already reached the conclusion that the Declarations do not contribute new elements to the discussion on jurisdiction raised by the *Achmea* Decision that are potentially decisive for the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction. The Applicant does not claim that its right to be heard with respect to the issue of jurisdiction, in particular the impact of the *Achmea* Decision, has otherwise been breached. Hence, the Committee cannot find that the Tribunal's exercise of discretion under Arbitration Rule 38(2) amounts to a violation of the Applicant's right to be heard on this matter.\n\n171.\n\nWith respect to the Tribunal's response that the request to reopen the proceeding came \"too late,\" the Applicant argues that it is never too late to reopen the proceeding while the award is still under the control of the tribunal and has not yet been dispatched to the parties.216 The Claimant does not necessarily disagree but emphasizes that the timeliness of the request ultimately depends on case-specific circumstances.217\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, p. 11-12.\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, pp. 45-46.\n\n172.\n\nThe Committee agrees that the assessment of the timeliness of a request to reopen the procedure requires an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the specific case and lies within the ample discretion of the Tribunal under Arbitration Rule 38(2). The circumstance that the Award had already been signed by one of the members of the Tribunal and was therefore for all practical purposes a final and closed text is a relevant consideration, again, considering the exceptional nature of the right to reopen the proceeding under Arbitration Rule 38(2). The Tribunal's response to the Applicant, albeit brief \u2013 as indeed were the communications from the Parties on the issue \u2013 does not violate a fundamental rule of procedure and in particular did not violate the Applicant's right to be heard.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal Did Not Seriously Depart from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure by Failing to Mention and State Reasons for its Decision to Reject the Applicant's Request to Reopen the Procedure***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Applicant claims that the Tribunal's decision not to reopen the procedure should have been included and justified in the Award. By failing to do so, the Tribunal failed to comply with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention that establishes that the Award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal. The Claimant argues that a request to reopen the proceeding does not fall within the meaning of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n174.\n\nThe questions referred to under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention refer to the factual and legal heads of claim presented by the parties. *Ad hoc* committees agree that tribunals need not respond to each and every argument presented during the proceedings. The questions that a tribunal is obliged to answer are those that are crucial or decisive because their \"acceptance would have altered the tribunal's conclusions.\"218\n\nSchreuer, Commentary, Article 52, para. 426 (**RLA-40**).\n\n175.\n\nThe failure to address the rejection to reopen the proceedings in the actual award cannot be said to amount to a \"question submitted to the tribunal\" within the meaning of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee notes that the issue here is not and should not be confused or equated with the substantive issue of the reopening of the proceedings, but the procedural decision to address this issue in a separate communication rather than in the Award itself. This procedural decision is clearly not itself \"a question submitted to the Tribunal,\" let alone a question that can be said to be crucial or decisive. Had the reference to the request to reopen been included in the Award, it would have been part of the summary of the proceedings, not of the Parties' submissions and as a mere procedural matter, and it would not have been crucial or decisive to the Tribunal's decision.\n\n176.\n\nThere is of course also the eminently practical matter that the Award had already been signed by one of the members of the Tribunal. Nothing would have been gained, in the eyes of the Committee, by incorporating a reference to the Applicant's request in the summary of the proceeding that could not equally be dealt with by a communication to the Parties, as the Tribunal chose to do. Requiring the Tribunal to reopen the Award every time a request to reopen the proceedings is denied, would result in a vicious circle.\n\n177.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal did not fail to comply with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention by not incorporating its decision on the Applicant's request under Rule 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules in the Award.\n\n***(d) The Tribunal Did Not Seriously Depart from the Principle of Equal Treatment by Introducing the Edenred and UP Awards***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe Applicant claims it suffered unequal treatment by the Tribunal's decision to introduce the *Edenred* and *UP* awards. First, because the Tribunal did not heed the Applicant's objections to introducing the awards. Second, since the awards were based on the same set of facts and involved declarations from the same witnesses and experts on behalf of Hungary, the Applicant was under heightened scrutiny from the Tribunal and was forced to defend itself not only against Sodexo's but also against Edenred and UP's arguments. Third, the Applicant finds that the Tribunal incorrectly relied on the decisions in the Awards on several outcome-determinative issues.\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee cannot detect any basis for the allegation of unequal treatment in the Tribunal's decisions relating to the *Edenred* and *UP* awards.\n\n180.\n\nFirst, in the absence of any agreement between the parties otherwise, the Tribunal had ample discretion to call upon the Parties to produce documents or other evidence, based on Article 43 of the ICSID Convention. Even so, the President of the Tribunal gave the Parties an opportunity to present their views on \"what to do with the *Edenred* Award\" during the hearing, as is clear from the record: \"What is the Tribunal to do with the reference to *Edenred* which is in the Claimant's Prehearing skeleton? And I'll ask Claimant first and then Respondent, and we're not saying that we're going to accept what you think we should do, but since it's a case that has obviously got parallels to our own, and since it was decided just a few months ago and has not been made public, but was cited by one side, we thought we had to raise this with the Parties as a matter of due process.\"219 The Applicant's claim has therefore no legal nor factual ground.\n\nHearing Transcript in Arbitration Proceeding, Day 3 (May 4, 2017), p. 816 (**R-2**).\n\n181.\n\nSecond, there is no evidence in the Award that the Tribunal held the Applicant to a higher standard than the Claimant in the appreciation of its factual statements or legal arguments. There is no indication that the Tribunal questioned or double-checked the evidence presented by the Applicant against the evidence presented in the *Edenred* and *UP* cases. There is also no suggestion in the Award that the Tribunal compared Hungary's legal strategies employed in the different cases, let alone that such treatment would have amounted to a breach of the duty to treat parties equally. The Applicant expressed these concerns to the Tribunal when it opposed the production of the Awards, but there is no sign that its fears materialized, nor has the Applicant tried to demonstrate that these alleged disadvantages effectively occurred.\n\n182.\n\nThird, the Committee is not convinced that the Tribunal relied on the decisions in the *Edenred* and *UP* awards to any significant degree. The Tribunal referred to the *Edenred* and *UP* awards only in a few instances, namely: to note in passing that, besides the *Edenred* and *UP* tribunals, no other arbitral tribunal has had the occasion to examine the exact legal issues in the instant arbitration;220 to express its wariness to draw any conclusions from Edenred's decision to stay in the Hungarian market;221 to share a concern with the *Edenred* tribunal that considering reforms acceptable merely because they benefitted a charitable foundation would open the door for unlawful expropriation by other states;222 and to note its slightly different approach towards the relevance of the CJEU decision on discrimination in *Commission v. Hungary*.223 Significantly, the Tribunal explicitly stated that it did not rely on the *Edenred* and *UP* cases to reach its decisions.224\n\nAward, para. 210.\n\nAward, para. 254.\n\nAward, para. 361.\n\nAward, paras. 312 and 371-372.\n\nAward, para. 381.\n\n183.\n\nNone of these references go beyond the usual way in which tribunals refer to decisions in other cases, either to call attention to similarities of criteria, or of relevant legal considerations of even comparable factual circumstances, and if anything, show that the Tribunal reached its conclusions independently. None of this could give rise to a violation of the principle of equal treatment. Therefore, the Applicant's request for annulment on this account must fail.\n\n**C. The Award Failed To State The Reasons On Which it is Based (Article 52(1)(E))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe final ground for annulment set out in Hungary's Application for Annulment is that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based. Hungary asserts that the Award should be annulled because it does not satisfy the reasoning requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.225 In particular, Hungary makes two main arguments. First, it argues that the Tribunal failed to address Hungary's essential arguments on the inapplicability of Article 9(2) of the BIT. Second, Hungary contends that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for rejecting Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings. A summary of these arguments is set out in parts (b) and (c) below. Hungary's position regarding the legal test for annulment is first addressed in part (a).\n\nMemorial, para. 263.\n\n***(a) The Legal Test for Annulment under Article 52(1)(e)***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nHungary asserts that the Tribunal has a duty to provide reasons for its decision, which is a \"necessary prerequisite for the orderly administration of justice\" pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.226 According to Hungary, the Tribunal's duty in this context is two-fold.\n\nMemorial, para. 265, referring to Schreuer, Commentary, Article 52, para. 338 (**RLA-40**).\n\n186.\n\nFirst, Hungary submits that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention stipulates that the Tribunal must deal with every question submitted to it, however this does not mean that it should address all the arguments raised by the Parties but it should address \"crucial or decisive arguments that could change the outcome, if accepted.\"227 To support this assertion, Hungary relies on the findings of the *ad hoc* Committees in *M.C.I. v. Ecuador* and *MINE v. Guinea*.228\n\nMemorial, para. 267, referring to Rudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law (2d ed. 2012), p. 308 (**RLA-61**); *Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*, para. 15 (**RLA-62**).\n\nMemorial, paras. 268-269, citing to *M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Decision on Annulment (October 19, 2009), para. 67 (\"***M.C.I. v. Ecuador***\") (**RLA-16**); *MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.13 (**RLA-57**).\n\n187.\n\nSecond, Hungary contends that under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, the obligation that the award must state all reasons upon which it is based means that the award should allow the reader to understand the tribunal's motives and \"follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law.\"229 According to Hungary, an award must at least highlight the rationale behind those points that are essential to the tribunal's reasoning. In this regard, Hungary submits that an *ad hoc* committee need not inquire into the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasons offered by a tribunal but is required to assess whether the tribunal's reasons are \"frivolous, perfunctory or absurd\" and whether they are sufficient to allow the parties to understand the decision.230 Hungary asserts that the Committee's purview extends to verifying the existence of contradictions in the stated reasons that would make the Tribunal's reasoning unintelligible, and submits that a \"genuine contradiction\" has been accepted to amount to a failure to state reasons.231\n\nMemorial, para. 270, referring to *MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.08 (**RLA-57**); *TECO v. Guatemala*, para. 87 (**RLA-37**).\n\nMemorial, para. 271, referring to Schreuer, Commentary, Article 52, para. 344 (**RLA-40**).\n\nMemorial, para. 272, referring to *Vivendi v.

Philippines*, para. 272 (**RLA-41**).\n\n***(b) The Tribunal Failed to Address Essential Arguments of Hungary on the Inapplicability of Article 9(2) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe first assertion under this ground is that the Tribunal failed to analyze the question of whether EU law forms part of international law.\n\n189.\n\nFirst, Hungary notes that the Tribunal determined that the dispute did \"not involve the application of the law of any EU state, or EU law as such.\"232 The Tribunal then proceeded to distinguish the applicable law clause contained in Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT at issue in the *Achmea* case from Article 9(3) of the BIT in the present proceedings, in so far as the latter made no reference to the domestic law of the Contracting Parties.233\n\nMemorial, para. 275, citing Award, para. 181 (**RLA-4**).\n\nMemorial, para. 276, referring to Award, para. 182 (**RLA-4**).\n\n190.\n\nIn Hungary's view, by concluding that EU law would not apply in the present case under Article 9(3) of the BIT, unlike in the case of *Achmea*, the Tribunal failed to address Hungary's argument that EU law forms part of international law, pursuant to the provisions of Article 9(3) of the BIT.234 Hungary had argued that EU law has to be classified as international law consistent with the practice of investment treaty tribunals in its letter to the Tribunal dated March 27, 2018. In its subsequent comments on the EC's *amicus curiae* brief it had made additional arguments on the applicability of EU law.235\n\nMemorial, para. 278. *See also* Hungary's Letter to the Tribunal regarding the *Achmea* Decision (March 27, 2018), p. 4 (**R-6**).\n\nMemorial, paras. 279-280, referring to Hungary's Letter to the Tribunal regarding the *Achmea* Decision (March 27, 2018), p. 4, footnote 7 (referring, among others, to *Electrabel v. Hungary* (**RLA-017**), *AES v. Hungary* (**CLA-30**), and *J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen v. Czech Republic* (**RLA-20**); Claimant's Letter to the Tribunal regarding the *Achmea* Decision (April 16, 2018), Section 1: \"The Tribunal is Not Bound by EU Law, Neither on Jurisdiction Nor on the Merits\" at pp. 2-4 (**R-14**); EC's Amicus Curiae Submission (September 14, 2018), paras. 10-12 (**R-15**); Hungary's Comments on the E C's Amicus Curiae Submission (September 28, 2018), p. 2 (**R-7**).\n\n191.\n\nSecond, Hungary submits that the Tribunal's reasoning set out at paragraphs 188-189 of the Award regarding the application of EU law is contradictory and renders the Award unintelligible.236 The relevant paragraphs of the Award are reproduced below:\n\n*188. In the present case, the Tribunal must decide on Hungary's alleged liability on the basis of the BIT itself and international law, not EU law or the law of an EU state. No allegation has been made that EU law has been violated or that the controverted measures in question run contrary to EU law. Indeed, neither side in the present case has argued for the application of either Hungarian or EU law to the underlying dispute.*\n\n*189. In this connection, the Tribunal sees no reason to find an impairment of its jurisdiction by reason of the Achmea decision. The CJEU in Achmea ruled with respect to a treaty that required application of Slovakian law, as to which the tribunal in that case might need to interpret EU legal principles. In that context, Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT was precluded by Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU which establish a preliminary ruling procedure[] by which parties undertake not to submit disputes about the interpretation and application of EU law to methods of dispute settlements outside of the EU Treaties.*237\n\nMemorial, para. 283.\n\nAward, paras. 188-189 (**RLA-4**).\n\n192.\n\nHungary submits that the Tribunal's finding, as quoted above, that neither Party had argued for the application of EU law and that hence there was no impairment of its jurisdiction by reason of the *Achmea* decision, failed to address Hungary's submission that the risk that the Tribunal \"may\" be called on to interpret or apply EU law rather than actually applying it, created a conflict between the BIT and EU Treaties as per the *Achmea* decision.238\n\nMemorial, para. 285, referring to Hungary's Letter to the Tribunal regarding the *Achmea* Decision (March 27, 2018), p. 4 (**R-6**).\n\n193.\n\nHungary alleges that the Tribunal proceeded to acknowledge in paragraph 189 of the Award that in *Achmea*, the dispute resolution clause of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT was precluded by the EU Treaties since the tribunal in that case \"might need to interpret EU legal principles.\"239\n\nMemorial, para. 287, referring to Award, para. 199 (**RLA-4**).\n\n194.\n\nThus, for Hungary, the contradictory aspect of the Tribunal's findings is that in paragraph 188 of the Award, the Tribunal found it to be a relevant distinguishing factor that, in the present dispute, it was not actually called upon by the Parties to apply EU law, unlike in the *Achmea* arbitration, whereas in paragraph 189 of the Award, the Tribunal found that a different test applied to the *Achmea* Decision i.e., whether a tribunal \"might\" need to interpret or apply EU law.240 Hungary therefore submits that the Tribunal's failure to address every relevant question submitted to it as well as the contradictory findings on a point that is crucial to the outcome of the case justify annulment of the Award.241\n\nMemorial, para. 288.\n\nMemorial, paras. 289-290.\n\n195.\n\nFinally, Hungary submits that the Tribunal provided insufficient reasoning concerning the conflict of laws clauses under the VCLT and the TFEU. In the original proceedings, Hungary had argued that the \"incompatibility between the conflicting treaty obligations of France and Hungary in Article 9(2) of the BIT on the one hand, and the EU Treaties on the other hand, must be resolved in accordance with international law.\"242 According to Hungary, such incompatibility was to be resolved based on two provisions of international law applicable between France and Hungary \u2013 Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30(3) of the VCLT.243 Hungary submits that the Tribunal determined that the conflict resolution tool under Articles 59 and 30(3) of the VCLT and the conflict resolution tool in the TFEU did not apply since the TFEU and the BIT did not share the same subject matter.244 As regards the inapplicability of Article 30(3) of the VCLT, Hungary's contention is that the Tribunal failed to provide any reasons concerning the degree of overlap between successive treaties applying Article 30(3) of the VCLT and why the TFEU and the BIT did not satisfy that standard.245\n\nMemorial, para. 291.\n\nMemorial, para. 292.\n\nMemorial, para. 293, referring to Award, para. 192 (**RLA-4**).\n\nMemorial, para. 295.\n\n196.\n\nHungary alleges that the Tribunal did not address the argument that where there is a conflict between two treaties, it has to be assumed that they share the same subject matter, and also that the Tribunal failed to state reasons why Hungary's arguments regarding the effect of Article 351 of the TFEU were incorrect.246 In particular, Hungary does not agree with the Tribunal's ruling regarding the inapplicability of Article 30(3) of the VCLT because of divergent subject matter and hence the inapplicability of the conflict resolution tool in the TFEU. Hungary argues that the application of Article 351 of the TFEU is not dependent on the application of Articles 30(3) and 59 of the VCLT nor does it require that the treaties in conflict share the same subject matter.247 Hungary contends that Article 351 of the TFEU provides that \"in the event of an inconsistency between EU Treaties and provisions of prior treaties concluded by two EU Member States, the provisions of the EU law must prevail.\"248 Therefore, Hungary submits that the Tribunal's reasons do not follow logically and it is difficult for the reader to understand the Tribunal's motives.249\n\nMemorial, paras. 296-297, referring to Hungary's Comments on the European Commission's *Amicus Curiae* Submission (September 28, 2018), p. 8 (**R-7**).\n\nMemorial, paras. 300-301.\n\nMemorial, para. 301.\n\nMemorial, para. 302.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal Failed to State Reasons for Rejecting Hungary's Request to Reopen the Proceedings***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nHungary's second assertion under this ground is that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for rejecting Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings. As outlined in Section B above, Hungary contends that the Tribunal's failure to state reasons for rejecting Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure i.e., Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.250 However, Hungary argues that the Tribunal's omission may also qualify as an independent ground of a \"failure to state reasons.\"251 Reiterating the arguments made previously, Hungary asserts that the Tribunal's short notice by email of January 22, 2019, rejecting its request to reopen the proceedings \"does not qualify as an award and is therefore \u2013 in principle \u2013 not subject to review by this Committee on the ground of 'failure to state reasons.'\"252 Further, Hungary asserts that the Tribunal's decision to reject the request to reopen the proceedings should have been included in the Award according to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and should be subject to review by this Committee under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.253 In conclusion, Hungary submits that the Tribunal's short message rejecting the request to reopen the proceedings does not enable a reader to understand the Tribunal's analysis and there is no explanation as to what the Tribunal meant in the Award.254\n\nMemorial, para. 305.\n\nMemorial, para. 306.\n\nMemorial, para. 307.\n\nMemorial, para. 308.\n\nMemorial, paras. 310-311.\n\n***b. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nUnder the final ground for annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant sets forth five arguments: (a) the relevant applicable standard; (b) the Tribunal's alleged failure to address the question of EU law as part of international law does not warrant annulment of the Award; (c) the alleged contradictory reasoning at paragraphs 188 and 189 of the Award does not warrant annulment of the Award; (d) the alleged insufficient or incoherent reasoning regarding conflict rules does not warrant annulment of the Award; and (e) the alleged failure to state reasons for rejecting Hungary's request for the reopening of the proceedings annulment of the Award does not warrant annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(a) The Relevant Legal Standard***\n-------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimant agrees with Hungary as to the relevant legal standard, pursuant to Article 52(1)(e), i.e., \"an award may be annulled (i) if the tribunal has failed to deal with every question that was submitted to it, or (ii) if the award fails to state the reasons on which it is based.\"255\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 224.\n\n200.\n\nFirst, with respect to the tribunal's failure to deal with every question that was submitted to it, the Claimant agrees with Hungary's position, as set out in *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, pursuant to which \"it would be unreasonable to require a tribunal to answer each and every argument which was made in connection with the issues that the tribunal has to decide [\u2026].\"256 In addition, the Parties agree that \"only a failure to address a question that would 'render the award unintelligible' would lead to annulment of the award\" as confirmed by the *ad hoc* committee in *Duke v. Peru*.257\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 225, citing to *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 67 (**RLA-16**); Rejoinder, para. 224.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 226, citing to *Duke v. Peru*, para. 228 (**CLA-029**).\n\n201.\n\nSecond, with respect to Hungary's contention that the award fails to state the reasons on which it is based, the Claimant agrees with Hungary that this has been interpreted to mean that \"an award must highlight the rationale behind those points that are essential to the tribunal's reasoning.\"258 However, the Claimant asserts that a tribunal is not required to substantiate every single legal principle relied upon in its award.259 Further, the Claimant argues that *ad hoc* committees will not be \"'required to inquire into the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasons offered by a tribunal,' unless such reasons are manifestly 'frivolous, perfunctory or absurd.'\"260\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 228, referring to Memorial, para. 270.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 228.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 229, citing to Memorial, para. 271.\n\n***(b) The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to Analyse the Question of EU Law as Part of International Law Does Not Warrant Annulment of the Award***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimant rejects Hungary's assertion that by failing to address the argument that EU law forms part of international law, the Award has failed to deal with every question that was submitted to the Tribunal. According to the Claimant, while the argument concerning EU law was not addressed in the Award, this does not render the Award \"unintelligible.\"261\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 233.\n\n203.\n\nFurther, the Claimant argues that there exists a distinction between \"questions\" and \"arguments.\" In this context, the Claimant argues that *ad hoc* committees have determined that, whereas \"a tribunal has a duty to deal with each of the questions\" it is not obligated, however, to \"comment on all arguments of the parties.\"262 The Claimant's position is that if this distinction were applied to the present case and given Hungary's presentation of the EU law issue as an \"argument,\" then the argument did not require a response from the Tribunal, whether explicitly or implicitly.263 In any event, the Claimant asserts that the Tribunal addresses Hungary's argument at paragraph 182 of the Award, specifically finding that it shall rule in accordance with the provisions of the BIT and principles of international law and that it was not bound to apply either Hungarian or EU law.264 The Claimant notes that \"Hungary's argument that EU law forms part of international law has never been relied upon by any tribunal as a basis for declining jurisdiction.\" Thus, the Claimant concludes that whether or not the EU law argument was addressed in the Award is irrelevant because it was not outcome determinative.265\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 235, citing to *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic (July 30, 2010), para. 222 (\"***Enron v. Argentina***\") (**CLA-006**); Rejoinder, para. 234.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 236.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 239.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Alleged Contradictory Reasoning at Paragraphs 188 and 189 of the Award Does Not Warrant Annulment of the Award***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimant objects to Hungary's assertion that paragraphs 188 and 189 of the Award are contradictory. According to the Claimant, these paragraphs do make sense considering the rest of the Award.266 Specifically, in paragraphs 187 through 190, the Tribunal notes and explains the applicability of EU law in the indicated contexts.267 Therefore, in the present case, the Tribunal found that EU law did not apply but also found that \"the risk that it 'might' need to interpret EU law did not exist, in light of the wording of Article 9(3) of the BIT.\"268\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 245.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 245.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 246.\n\n***(d) The Tribunal's Alleged Insufficient or Incoherent Reasoning Regarding Conflict Rules Does Not Warrant Annulment of the Award***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nWith respect to Hungary's argument that the Tribunal's alleged insufficient and incoherent reasoning regarding the conflict of law clauses at Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30(3) of the VCLT justify annulment, the Claimant asserts that the Tribunal's reasoning regarding the conflict rules was neither insufficient nor incoherent.269 To illustrate this assertion, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal found that in relation to (i) Article 351 of the TFEU, no conflict exists between the TFEU and the BIT; and (ii) Article 30(3) of the VCLT, that \"the TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT do not share the same subject matter, as required for the application of the VCLT provisions.\"270 In both situations ruling that Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30(3) of the VCLT did not apply to this arbitration.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 251.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 251, referring to Awa rd, para. 192 (**RLA-4**).\n\n***(e) The Tribunal's Alleged Failure to State Reasons for Rejecting Hungary's Request to Reopen the Proceedings Does Not Warrant Annulment of the Award***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the aim of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is to ensure that an award \"highlight[s] the rationale behind those points that are essential to the tribunal's reasoning\" as opposed to making sure all procedural steps are accounted for exhaustively.271 Further, the Claimant asserts that there was no need for the Award to provide reasons for the Tribunal's decision not to reopen the proceedings, which had been explained in writing, even if Hungary terms the explanation as \"cursory.\"272 Thus, while Hungary may consider the justification to be cursory, this does not justify annulment of the Award.273 To support this assertion, the Claimant relies on *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela*, in which the tribunal ruled on Venezuela's document production request in two sentences in the original arbitration and, in the annulment proceeding, Venezuela argued that \"this decision represented a sanctionable failure to state reasons, in addition to amounting to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"274 The *ad hoc* committee in that case found that it could not pronounce a decision without a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tribunal's decision, and that such an investigation went beyond the functions of an *ad hoc* committee.275\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 255.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 256.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 256.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 257-258, citing to *Venezuela Holdings v.

Venezuela*, para. 127 (**RLA-34**).\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nIn relation to the Applicant's request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee must respond to the following questions: (a) what is the legal standard to determine that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the award is based; (b) did the Tribunal fail to state reasons when it decided that the *Achmea* Decision has no preclusive effect on its jurisdiction over the dispute based on Article 9(2) of the BIT, in particular: first, did the Tribunal fail to analyze whether EU law forms part of international law; second, is the reasoning of the Tribunal in paragraphs 188 and 189 of the Award regarding the application of EU law contradictory to such extent that it renders the Award unintelligible; third, is the reasoning of the Tribunal regarding conflict of law rules in the TFEU and the VCLT insufficient or incoherent; and (c) did the Tribunal fail to state reasons for its decision to reject Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings.\n\n***(a) The Relevant Legal Standard***\n-------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nArticle 48(3) of the ICSID Convention provides that the award \"shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\" Failure to state the reasons on which the award is based, is a ground for annulment under Article (52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n209.\n\nEven though a failure to deal with questions submitted to a tribunal is not a separate ground for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, various *ad hoc* committees have considered that such failure may amount to a failure to state reasons.276 As those committees stated, this does not mean that the tribunal should address every argument raised by the parties with respect to each question submitted to it.277\n\n*See* *M.C.I. v. Ecuador,* para. 66 (**RLA-16**); *MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.13 (**RLA-057**); *Wena v. Egypt,* para. 101 (**RLA-42**); *Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*, para. 131 (**RLA-62**). Other *ad hoc* committees have considered that a failure to decide a question submitted to the tribunal may amount to an excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention, *see* *Duke v. Peru*, para. 229 (**CLA-029**), *Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 64 (**RLA-28**), and *Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*, para. 133 (**RLA-62**).\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 67 (**RLA-16**); *Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*, para. 131 (**RLA-62**); *Enron v. Argentina*, para. 72 (**CLA-006**).\n\n210.\n\nConsidering that Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention provides for a separate remedy to request a supplemental decision in cases where the tribunal failed to deal with a question submitted to it, *ad hoc* committees have analyzed the relationship between the annulment proceedings and the proceedings for completion of an award.278 In that regard, the *ad hoc* committee in *Wena v. Egypt* declared that the ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention includes the case where the tribunal omitted to decide upon a question submitted to it to the extent such supplemental decision may affect the reasoning of the award.279 Further, due to the existence of the remedy in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the *ad hoc* committee in *Duke v. Peru* stated that a failure to address every question will not *ipso facto* constitute a ground for annulment, but it is necessary for the applicant to demonstrate that such a failure amounts to a failure in the intelligibility of the reasoning of the award itself.280\n\nSee M.C.I. v. Ecuador, paras. 68-69 (**RLA-16**). *See also* *Enron v. Argentina*, para 73 (**CLA-06**): \"Furthermore, even in cases where a tribunal has failed to deal with a question submitted to it, the appropriate remedy may not be an application for annulment, but rather, an application to the tribunal for a supplementary decision, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n*See* *Wena v. Egypt*, para. 101 (**RLA-42**).\n\n*Duke v. Peru*, para. 228 (**CLA-029**).\n\n211.\n\nHungary and the Claimant are largely in agreement with respect to the requirements for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.281\n\n*See* paras. 185-187 and 199-201 a bove.\n\n212.\n\nThe tribunal's failure to state reasons must result in some kind of inability for the reader to understand the tribunal's reasoning. Specifically, following the often-cited formula for the requirements of failure to state reasons set forth by the *MINE v. Guinea ad hoc* committee, the reader must be able \"to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\"282\n\n*MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.09 (**RLA-057**).\n\n213.\n\nA total absence of reasons, or frivolous or contradictory reasons are clearly a cause for annulment.283 It is more controversial where insufficient or inadequate reasons may be cause for annulment as well. An annulment procedure is not an appeal and it is not the task of an *ad hoc* committee to evaluate the correctness of an award on the basis of the strength of its reasoning.284 There is a fine line between finding reasons insufficient or inadequate on the one hand and finding them unpersuasive on the other.\n\n*Soufraki*, para. 126 (**RLA-28**); *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 84 (**RLA-16**).\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 64 (**RLA-28**). *See also* *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35 (September 17, 2020), para. 165 (\"***Orascom v. Algeria***\"): \"The correctness of the reasoning is not relevant for the purpose of annulment and the *ad hoc* committees are not expected to review this aspect of the reasoning. Otherwise they would act as an appellate body.\"\n\n214.\n\nIn this context, the Committee finds it helpful to point out that the objective of the requirement to state reasons is fundamentally to keep arbitrariness at bay. By having to provide reasons, a tribunal is more likely to consider the arguments presented by either party, and to establish reasonable connections between the facts and the law before reaching its decision. At a minimum, the requirement to state reasons allows the parties to be satisfied that their arguments have been considered, even if not accepted, and that the decision is the outcome of a deliberative process. At a maximum, the requirement for the award to state reasons allows the parties to be persuaded that the decision is reasonable or even correct.\n\n215.\n\nFor the purposes of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the minimum is sufficient for a decision to withstand a request for annulment. In the view of the Committee, this means that the decisions reached must consider the parties' positions, even if they are neither limited nor bound by them. It also means that the reader must be able to follow the Tribunal's reasoning process on points of fact and law in order to understand how and why the Tribunal arrived at its decision.285\n\n*Orascom v. Algeria*, para. 170.\n\n216.\n\nThe reasoning need not be exhaustive. It may be implicit or be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision, read as a whole.286\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, para. 81 (**RLA-42**); *See also* Azurix v. Argentina, para. 54.\n\n217.\n\nThe Parties agree that, with respect to the alleged contradiction of the reasoning of the Tribunal, two genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out. Therefore, it is, in principle, appropriate to qualify contradictory reasons as failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.287 However, contradictory reasons should be distinguished from reasons which are claimed to be legally or factually wrong, which escape review by *ad hoc* committees.288\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon,* para. 116 (**RLA-62**).\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 85 (**RLA-16**).\n\n218.\n\nFinally, the Committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi I* that annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention should only occur when the particular point lacking in reasons is itself necessary to the tribunal's decision.289\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 65 (**RLA-28**).\n\n***(b) The Tribunal Stated Reasons for its Decision on Jurisdiction under Article 9 of the France-Hungary BIT and its Reasoning is not Contradictory***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nIn order to appreciate whether the Tribunal stated the reasons for its decision that it had jurisdiction under Article 9(2) of the BIT, despite the *Achmea* Decision, the Committee will briefly summarize the Award on this point.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal commenced its reasoning by referring to Article 9(2) and 9(3) of the BIT.290 It stated that, in order to decide on jurisdiction, it must consider the impact of the CJEU's *Achmea* Decision.291 The Tribunal devoted subsequent sections to a discussion of the *Achmea* Decision,292 the Parties' positions on the *Achmea* Decision,293 and the EC's *amicus curiae* brief and intervention in the Arbitration.294 The Tribunal made reference to, among others: (i) the argument raised by the Applicant and the EC that Article 9(2) of the BIT is incompatible with Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU; (ii) the conflict rules contained in the VCLT; and (iii) the allegation that the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction would lead to the fragmentation of international law.\n\nAward, paras. 138 and 139.\n\nAward, para. 140.\n\nAward, paras. 145-151.\n\nAward, paras. 152-160.\n\nAward, paras. 161-177.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal also reflected on the Claimant's arguments to the effect that EU law was irrelevant to the Tribunal's determination of jurisdiction; the inapplicability of the *Achmea* Decision to the case due to the fact that the Tribunal was not required to interpret or apply EU or Hungarian law, and that neither the EU nor the VCLT's conflict rules apply because the two treaties in question, the TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT, do not share the same subject matter.\n\n222.\n\nIn order to conduct its analysis, the Tribunal, as an initial matter, after transcribing the relevant provisions of the TFEU involved in the *Achmea* Decision, noted that the dispute does not involve the application of the law of any EU state, or the law of the EU as such, a finding central to its reasoning affirming its jurisdiction over the dispute.295\n\nAward, para. 181.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to differentiate between the arbitration clauses under the two BITs, pointing out that Article 9 of the France-Hungary BIT does not contain an explicit reference to the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned, which would have included European law, and that it is, therefore, not called to interpret the law of any European state or European law. The Tribunal added that such provision remains highly significant in light of other treaties with contrasting applicable law provisions.296\n\nAward, para. 182.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal then mentioned that in addressing \"international law,\" it considered the ordinary meaning of the treaty provisions and other applicable sources as established under Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, stating in the following paragraph that \"[t]hus, the Tribunal would not apply either Hungarian or EU law.\"297\n\nAward, paras. 183-184.\n\n225.\n\nNext, the Tribunal determined that the CJEU ruling is binding on the EU state court in Germany that requested the preliminary ruling, and possibly on other EU Member State courts, but not on ICSID tribunals whose authority rests on the ICSID Convention.298 It noted that the awards of ICSID tribunals do not risk annulment in any of the EU Member States,299and that by contrast, the *Achmea* Decision concerned the award of an *ad hoc* arbitration tribunal, subject to the law of Germany, an EU Member State.300\n\nAward, para. 185.\n\nAward, para. 186.\n\nAward, para. 187.\n\n226.\n\nContinuing with its reasoning and based on its previous findings, the Tribunal stated that it must decide the case based on the BIT and international law, not EU law or the law of an EU state. It concluded that in the case before it, neither Party argued for the application of either Hungarian or EU law.301\n\nAward, para. 188.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the *Achmea* Decision concerned the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, instructing the tribunal to apply Slovakian law, which might require the interpretation of EU legal principles. The Tribunal continued its reasoning by stating that under these circumstances, Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT was precluded by Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.302 The Tribunal concluded its analysis by noting that in the case submitted to it, such reasoning did not bar its jurisdiction, and consequently no risk exists of substantive legal fragmentation.303\n\nAward, para. 189.\n\nAward, para. 190.\n\n228.\n\nAs a final step, the Tribunal established that neither the TFEU's nor the VCLT's provisions on conflict apply in this arbitration, because there exists no conflict between the TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT that would negate the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and also because the TFEU and the France-Hungary BIT do not share the same subject matter.304\n\nAward, para. 192.\n\n229.\n\nAs stated in paragraph 193 of the Award, based on the reasons set forth above and after having considered the *Achmea* Decision and the submissions before it, the Tribunal concluded that *Achmea* has no preclusive effect such as to remove its jurisdiction to hear the dispute.305\n\nAward, para. 194.\n\n230.\n\nThe Committee has no difficulty following the reasoning of the Tribunal discussing Hungary's, and the EC's allegations, concerning the inapplicability of Article 9(2) of the BIT to the present dispute due to the *Achmea* Decision. The Tribunal's reasoning is based on two central elements.\n\n231.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal noted that, different from the *Achmea* Decision, the dispute before it did not involve the application of the law of any EU state, or EU law as such. This is reinforced, in view of the Tribunal, by the fact that no allegation was made that EU law had been violated or that the controverted measures in question ran contrary to EU law. As the Tribunal further noted, neither side in the case argued for the application of either Hungarian nor EU law to the underlying dispute, and the Tribunal was not asked to decide whether Hungary's conduct breached EU law.\n\n232.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee notes that the Separate and Dissenting Opinion agreed with the majority that the *Achmea* Decision did not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the dispute.306 Mr. Thomas' conclusion coincides with the Tribunal's findings, stating that: \"[o]n a separate point, I note that the stated policy concern in *Achmea* was that an arbitral tribunal with no power to refer questions of EU law to the CJEU might err in its application of EU law. That concern does not arise on the facts of the present case.\"307\n\nSeparate and Dissenting Opinion, para. 64.\n\nSeparate and Dissenting Opinion, para. 69.\n\n233.\n\nThe second element of the Tribunal's reasoning is the difference between the language of the applicable law clauses contained in Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, at issue in *Achmea*, and Article 9(3) of the BIT in the Hungary-France BIT, applicable to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. For the Tribunal, it determined that, Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT provides that the tribunal shall take into account *inter alia* the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned \"which of course would be the law of an EU member state.\"308 Whereas Article 9(3) of the Hungary-France BIT establishes that that the arbitral tribunal \"shall rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and principles of international law.\"309 In the words of the Tribunal, Article 9(3) \"[\u2026] remains highly significant, particularly in light of other treaties with contrasting applicable law provisions.\"310\n\nAward, para 182.\n\nArticle 9(3) of the BIT (**RLA-13**).\n\nAward, para 182.\n\n234.\n\nThese two elements led the Tribunal to conclude that *Achmea* had no preclusive effect on its jurisdiction. Moreover, in the Committee's view, the necessary conclusion that derives from the Tribunal's reasoning contained in paragraphs 189 and 192 of the Award, is that because of Article 9(3) of the BIT, there is no incompatibility between the TFEU and the BIT and therefore the conflict provisions of the TFEU do not apply in this arbitration.\n\n235.\n\nIn this context, the Committee does not agree that the Tribunal failed in the specific allegations made by Hungary under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, with respect to the Tribunal's decision to assert jurisdiction over the dispute based on Article 9(2) of the BIT.\n\n236.\n\nFirst, the Committee does not agree with Hungary that the Tribunal failed to address a question or argument submitted to it, in particular, whether EU law forms part of international law.311\n\nThe Parties have debated whether the issue raised by Hungary is a question or an argument. The Committee does not consider that distinction useful for its decision in the present case. The Committee acknowledges that the issue before the Tribunal was whether the *Achmea* Decision precluded its jurisdiction to hear the dispute and that one the arguments raised by Hungary was that EU law shall be considered \"international law\" for the purposes of Article 9(2) of the BIT. In that regard, whether the issue was either a question or an argument, the Tribunal needed to address it in its decision.\n\n237.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, the Tribunal addressed and rejected that possibility in its Award. The Committee agrees with the Claimant that this is the necessary result of the reasoning contained in paragraphs 182, 183 and 184 of the Award. Moreover, that reasoning is confirmed by the Tribunal's statement that it \"must decide on Hungary's alleged liability on the basis of the BIT itself and international law, not EU law or the law of an EU state,\"312 making clear that the Tribunal does not consider EU law as part of \"international law\" under the applicable law clause of the BIT.\n\nAward, para. 188.\n\n238.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee does not find that the Tribunal failed to consider the question of whether EU law forms part of international law, pursuant to the provisions of Article 9(2) of the BIT. The Committee understands that Hungary disagrees with the Tribunal's conclusion and that it would have preferred a more detailed analysis of its argument, but this obviously is not a reason for annulment under the legal test described by the Committee above.313\n\n*See* para. 208 above *et seq*.\n\n239.\n\nAs stated before, the reasons on which the Award is based need not be exhaustive, and they may be implicit or be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision, read as a whole. In addition, the Committee fails to see, in the words of the *ad hoc* committee in *Enron v. Argentina* that we are in the presence of \"a clear case when there has been a failure by the tribunal to state any reasons for its decision on a particular question [\u2026]\"314 And certainly the Applicant has not demonstrated that the alleged failure renders the reasoning of the Award unintelligible.315\n\n*Enron v. Argentina*, para 74.\n\n*Duke v. Peru*, para. 228 (**CLA-029**).\n\n240.\n\nSecond, the Committee also disagrees with Hungary that the Tribunal's reasoning set out at paragraphs 188 and 189 of the Award, regarding the application of EU law, is contradictory and renders the award unintelligible.\n\n241.\n\nAccording to Hungary, in paragraph 188 of the Award, the Tribunal differentiated the present dispute from the *Achmea* Decision, in that the Tribunal was not actually called upon to apply EU law; whereas in paragraph 189, the Tribunal found that the test which applied in the *Achmea* Decision is whether a tribunal might need to interpret or apply EU law.316\n\nMemorial, para. 284.\n\n242.\n\nThe Committee does not follow the contradiction alleged by the Applicant. As previously mentioned, the reasoning of the Tribunal is based on two central elements. First, that the dispute before it did not actually involve the application of the law of any EU state or the law of the EU as such. In this context, the Tribunal did not mention the *Achmea* Decision. And second, the differences between the language of the applicable law clauses of Article 9(3) of the BIT and Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, in which the Tribunal considered that there was no risk that it might have to apply EU law nor was there a risk of substantive legal fragmentation.317 In the view of the Committee, paragraphs 188 and 189 are consistent with these two different strains in the reasoning of the Tribunal that, together, support its decision on jurisdiction.\n\n*See* Award, para. 190.\n\n243.\n\nThird, the Committee also disagrees with Hungary that the reasoning of the Tribunal regarding the conflict of law clauses under the TFEU and the VCLT are insufficient or incoherent.\n\n244.\n\nIn paragraph 192 of the Award, the Tribunal determined that the provisions on conflicts of law of the TFEU and the VCLT do not apply in the arbitration. With respect to the former, because there is no incompatibility between the TFEU and the BIT, no conflict can exist between the two. With respect to the latter, because the TFEU and the BIT do not share the same subject matter, the Tribunal decided that the VCLT did not apply in this arbitration.\n\n245.\n\nAs previously confirmed in paragraph 234 above, the Committee's conclusion necessarily derives from the Tribunal's reasoning contained in paragraphs 189 and 192 of the Award. Indeed, since the Tribunal did not consider EU law as part of international law under Article 9(3) of the BIT, there could be no incompatibility between the TFEU and the BIT, and, as a result, the conflict provisions of the TFEU or the VCLT do not apply in the arbitration.\n\n246.\n\nThe Committee understands, and to some extent shares, Hungary's desire for a more detailed response from the Tribunal to Hungary's arguments, including a specific reference to Article 351 of the TFEU. However, this is not a basis for annulment of the Award under failure to state reasons, nor does it render the reasoning insufficient or incoherent. To the extent that a reader can understand how and why the Tribunal arrived at its decision, the standard for providing reasons is satisfied, a test that, as already expressed, the Committee considers satisfied by the Award.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal Did Not Fail to State Reasons when it Rejected Hungary's Request to Reopen the Procedure***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nHungary's second assertion under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision to reject Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings. The arguments in support of this claim are in essence the same as those in support of its allegation that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to mention and state reasons for its decision to not reopen the proceedings.\n\n248.\n\nIn that regard, the Committee recalls that it has already determined that the Tribunal did not fail to comply with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention by not incorporating its decision on the Applicant's request under Arbitration Rule 38(2) in the Award.318\n\n*See* paragraph 177 above.\n\n249.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee does not follow Hungary's submission with respect to this ground and considers that it cannot be accepted. As the Applicant recognizes, the Tribunal's decision not to reopen the proceedings under Rule 38(2) does not qualify as an award and therefore is not subject to review by this Committee on the ground of failure to state reasons.319\n\nMemorial, para. 307.\n\n250.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Committee rejects Hungary's request for annulment based on the Tribunal's alleged failure to state reasons for rejecting Hungary's request to reopen the proceedings.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Submissions on Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nOn December 23 and December 29, 2020, the Parties filed their respective Statement of Costs pursuant to Arbitration Rules 28(2) and 53, paragraph 20 of Procedural Order No. 1, and the Committee's letter dated December 8, 2020.\n\n252.\n\nHungary and the Claimant each submit that this Committee should order the other Party to pay all costs associated with this annulment proceeding. Hungary sets forth the amount it claims as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **CATEGORY** | **AMOUNT** |\n| Attorney fees (DLA Piper) | HUF 207,777,000 |\n| ICSID Costs (Advances and registration fee) | USD 425,000 |\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimant quantifies the amount it claims as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **CATEGORY** | **AMOUNT** |\n| Simmons & Simmons legal fees | EUR 1,182,769.00 |\n| Simmons & Simmons expenses | EUR 16,256.39 |\n| Szecskay Attorneys at Law legal fees | EUR 25,892.00 |\n| Szecskay Attorneys at Law expenses | EUR 4,009.38 |\n| Total | EUR 1,228,926.77 |\n\n**B. The Committee's Decision on Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n255.\n\nThis provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of Arbitration Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the proceeding, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n256.\n\nThe annulment procedure is the only remedy available within the ICSID arbitration system to set aside an award on the basis of the limited grounds specified in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. There can be no doubt that Hungary had every right to pursue annulment of the Award.\n\n257.\n\nThe Committee has rejected Hungary's request for annulment in its entirety. However, that does not mean that Hungary's request for annulment was dilatory, unreasonable, or otherwise manifestly unfounded. Hungary's objections to some aspects of the Tribunal's decision, although they have not met the high standard for annulment set out under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, were serious and legitimately brought by Hungary. In this regard, the Committee notes that the jurisdictional aspect of the underlying arbitration has placed Hungary as a Member State of the European Union in the position that it cannot fail to request annulment of the Award. It is also the case that Sodexo's legal fees are significantly higher than those incurred by the Applicant. Under these circumstances, applying the principle that \"costs follow the event\" in relation to both legal fees and the costs of the proceeding would impose an unreasonable burden upon Hungary.\n\n258.\n\nThus, the Committee finds that each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses incurred during the annulment proceedings.\n\n259.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nCommittee Members' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mr. Andr\u00e9s Jana Linetzky | USD 104,250.00 |\n| Dr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu | USD 75,000.00 |\n| Dr. Jacomijn van Haersolte-van Hof | USD 71,437.50 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | USD 84,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | USD 7,077.25 |\n| **Total** | **USD 341,764.75** |\n\n260.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by Hungary pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).320\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicant.\n\n261.\n\nGiven that Hungary's bid for annulment was ultimately unsuccessful, and while not applying the principle of \"costs following the event\" in an unmitigated fashion, the Committee decides that Hungary shall bear all administrative costs related to the annulment proceeding. Hungary has already paid all administrative costs, through advance payments, in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations. Hence, there will be no reimbursements between the Parties related to legal costs.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n262.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee decides as follows:\n\n(1) Hungary's Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on January 28, 2019, in the arbitration proceeding between Sodexo Pass International SAS and Hungary is rejected in its entirety;\n\n(2) Each Party shall bear the costs of its own legal fees and expenses related to the annulment procedure; and\n\n(3) Hungary shall bear all administrative costs incurred by the Centre related to the annulment procedure.\n\nDate: 2 May 2021"}]}
