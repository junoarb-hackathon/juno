Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration has been instituted by BA Desarrollos LLC [\"**BA Desarrollos**\" or \"**Claimant**\"] against the Argentine Republic [\"**Argentine Republic**\", \"**Respondent**\" or \"**State**\", and, together with Claimant, the \"**Parties**\"], pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States [\"**ICSID Convention**\"] and under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, signed on 14 November 1991 and entering into force on 20 October 1994 [\"**Treaty**\"]. This proceeding is governed by the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 1 July 2022 [\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"].\n\n2.\n\nOn 15 March 2024, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order [\"**PO**\"] No. 1.\n\n3.\n\nOn 29 March 2024, Claimant filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits [\"**Memorial**\"].\n\n4.\n\nOn 28 June 2024, Respondent submitted its Request for Bifurcation [\"**Request for Bifurcation**\"].\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 August 2024, Claimant submitted its Observations on the Request [\"**Response**\"].\n\n6.\n\nUpon deliberation, the Tribunal issues this decision on the Request for Bifurcation within the time limit set forth in the procedural calendars attached as Annex B to Procedural Order No. 1 [\"**Procedural Calendars**\"].\n\n**II. Facts**\n-------------\n\n7.\n\nIn 2016, the government of the city of Buenos Aires launched a road modernization project called \"Paseo del Bajo\". To the east of Paseo del Bajo, there was vacant or underutilized state-owned land which, according to Claimant, was at odds with those renovation plans; this prompted the State to call an auction for their sale and subsequent real estate development as residential and office buildings. The entity in charge of the auction sale was the Argentine State Property Management Agency (*Agencia de Administraci\u00f3n de Bienes del Estado*) [\"**AABE**\"].\n\n8.\n\nClaimant has explained that Argentina promoted this auction both nationally and internationally, thus attracting the attention of the EMS Group \u2013 an investment group in high-end large-scale real estate projects (among others).1 The participation of the EMS Group in the auction was structured as follows: BA Desarrollos (Claimant in this arbitration) was created as a special purpose vehicle, managed by EMS Capital LP; and BA Desarrollos constituted a real estate trust in Argentina, called Fideicomiso BAP,2 as settlor/owner (*fiduciante*), beneficiary (*beneficiario*) and residuary beneficiary (*fideicomisario*). The interrelationship between these entities shall be relevant when analyzing the jurisdictional objections raised by the Argentine Republic.\n\nMemorial, para. 6.\n\nMemorial, para. 6.\n\n9.\n\nIn August 2018, Fideicomiso BAP was awarded two plots of land at auction, paying a total of USD 49.08 M for them,3 with the intention of developing a real estate project on them.\n\nMemorial, para. 7.\n\n10.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the project was frustrated by Respondent's allegedly obstructive conduct, and by its subsequent expropriation.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 December 2020, notice was served upon the AABE of an administrative claim based on a series of obstacles affecting the acquired plots and the development of the project. The content of this claim and the identity of the plaintiff shall be of importance in assessing certain jurisdictional objections.\n\n12.\n\nIn Claimant's opinion, the conduct described above, attributable to the Argentine Republic, entails a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, including a prohibition on impairing investments by arbitrary or discriminatory measures, and a prohibition on expropriating without adequate compensation, as set forth in Arts. II(2) and IV of the Treaty, and giving rise to the commencement of this arbitration.\n\n**III. Applicable Standard**\n----------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Argentine Republic submits its Request for Bifurcation under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44(2), which reads as follows:\n\n\"Rule 44: Preliminary Objections with a Request for Bifurcation\n\n...\n\n(2) In determining whether to bifurcate, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including whether:\n\n(a) bifurcation would materially reduce the time and cost of the proceeding;\n\n(b) determination of the preliminary objection would dispose of all or a substantial portion of the dispute; and\n\n(c) the preliminary objection and the merits are so intertwined as to make bifurcation impractical.\"\n\n14.\n\nAt the core of the circumstances to be taken into account by the Arbitral Tribunal is whether bifurcation would result in procedural efficiency. Respondent argues that the bifurcation of jurisdictional objections is the option that offers the greatest procedural efficiency, while Claimant denies this.\n\n15.\n\nIn this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that Respondent has reserved the right to raise jurisdictional objections other than those raised in its Request for Bifurcation at a later stage.4\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, footnote 1.\n\n16.\n\nThis action by Respondent is perfectly legitimate in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 45(b)(i), which allows it to raise objections until the filing of the Counter-Memorial.\n\n17.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal cannot ignore the possibility that, were it to bifurcate and reject the jurisdictional objections, it is still possible that after examining the merits the claim be dismissed on account of new jurisdictional objections being upheld \u2013 thus completely frustrating the intended efficiency of bifurcation.\n\n18.\n\nThis reservation of actions does not preclude the Arbitral Tribunal from nevertheless deciding to proceed with bifurcation, but it does impose a higher standard on Respondent when trying to persuade the Arbitral Tribunal of the relevance of the jurisdictional objections raised. Thus, should Claimant succeed in casting doubt on the binding force of such objections, the Arbitral Tribunal will be inclined not to bifurcate.\n\n**IV. Discussion**\n------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has raised a total of three groups of jurisdictional objections (**1. \u2013 3.**), which it considers to be of sufficient importance to warrant that they be considered separately from the merits of the case. Furthermore, it considers that the agreed Procedural Calendars, in the case of both bifurcation and non-bifurcation, support the notion that this would result in procedural efficiency **(4.**).\n\n**1. Denial of benefits**\n-------------------------\n\n20.\n\nArt. I(2) of the Treaty establishes the following:\n\n\"Article I\n\n(2) Each Party reserves the right to deny to any company of the other Party the advantages of this Treaty if (a) nationals of any third country, or nationals of such Party, control such company and the company has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party, or (b) the company is controlled by nationals of a third country with which the denying Party does not maintain normal economic relations.\"\n\n21.\n\nThe article \u2013 as applied to the case \u2013 lays down two alternative requirements to allow the Argentine Republic to deny benefits:\n\n- That nationals of a third party control BA Desarrollos and that the company has no substantial business activities in the United States of America; or\n\n- That BA Desarrollos is controlled by nationals of a third country with which the Argentine Republic does not maintain normal economic relations.\n\n22.\n\nThe second requirement is not satisfied. As for the first requirement, it is twofold. In this regard, neither Party disputes that nationals of a third country control BA Desarrollos; the discussion focuses on the second part: whether or not BA Desarrollos has substantial business activities in the territory of the United States of America.\n\n23.\n\nIn essence, Argentina argues that BA Desarrollos has no full-time employees exclusively engaged in commercial activities in the United States of America,5 no offices of its own,6 no expenses linked to business transactions in the United States of America;7 it only pays the minimum tax associated with its mere existence as a company registered in Delaware8 and has no governing bodies based in Delaware.9 For Respondent, it has been proven that Claimant has no genuine connection with its home State.10\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 41.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras. 39 and 42.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 43.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 45.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 46.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 28.\n\n24.\n\nClaimant does not deny the above facts, but deems them to be irrelevant.11 BA Desarrollos is a limited liability company created as a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of real estate development in Argentina,12 the business activity of which is carried out on its behalf13 through its manager, EMS Capital LP, based in New York.14 Claimant contends that the decision to act directly, or indirectly through EMS Capital LP, is purely commercial in nature and should not condition the assessment of whether or not there are \"substantial business activities\" in the United States of America \u2013 this has been expressly recognized by other arbitral tribunals.15\n\nResponse, para. 52.\n\nResponse, paras. 51 and 53.\n\nResponse, para. 54.\n\nResponse, para. 55.\n\nResponse, para. 57.\n\n25.\n\nIn any event, Claimant contends that Respondent is invoking the denial of benefits in an untimely fashion, after the alleged violation of the Treaty has already occurred; that is, it seeks to assert the denial of benefits with retroactive effect \u2013 something that is not permitted.16 Respondent denies this and argues that the Treaty does not impose any time limit on its right to invoke the denial of benefits; this has been allegedly recognized by prior awards.17\n\nResponse, para. 46.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras. 29-30.\n\n26.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, by majority, finds that the jurisdictional objection raised by Respondent is not without controversy: whether the denial of benefits has been invoked belatedly is a disputed issue. Furthermore, even if this had not been the case, it would remain to be determined whether the activity conducted in the United States of America by EMS Capital LP (allegedly) on behalf of Claimant would be sufficient to preclude the exercise of the denial of benefits.\n\n**2. Lack of investment**\n-------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the dispute arises out of the execution of a mere non-concluded transaction for the sale of land: a price was paid, but the ownership rights over the real estate property were not granted.18 Therefore, there is no risk inherent to a true investment.19\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 66.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 67.\n\n28.\n\nClaimant alleges that it has made an investment in the Argentine Republic, as it is the settlor/owner (*fiduciante*), beneficiary (*beneficiario*) and residuary beneficiary (*fideicomisario*) of Fideicomiso BAP, to which it has made equity and capital contributions.20 And Fideicomiso BAP is the holder of the rights associated with the award of the plots at auction.21 The investment related to the development of a long-term real estate project as part of a program for the improvement and modernization of the city of Buenos Aires22, to which the winning bidder was bound to23.\n\nResponse, para. 93.\n\nResponse, para. 93.\n\nResponse, para. 95.\n\nResponse, para. 97.\n\n29.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that the objection raised by the Argentine Republic focuses not so much on the relationship between Claimant and Fideicomiso BAP (nominally, the entity that was awarded the plots), but rather on the nature of the alleged investment. Since this objection is so intertwined with the merits of the case, it is difficult for it to be addressed in a bifurcated manner as Respondent expects.\n\n**3. Choice of forum and local jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nArts. VII(2) and (3) of the Treaty provide that:\n\n\"Article VII\n\n(2) In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:\n\na) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\nb) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or\n\nc) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n(3) (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ('Centre') established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 ('ICSID Convention'), provided that the Party is a party to such convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\niii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\niv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(b) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\"\n\n31.\n\nWhen on 30 December 2020 notice was served upon the AABE of the administrative claim based on the lack of execution of the deeds for the plots awarded at auction,24 this constituted a conscious choice of the local forum and, for purposes of the above-transcribed articles, the arbitral forum is already precluded and thus unavailable to Claimant, since both proceedings are grounded on the same fact.25\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 58.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 64.\n\n32.\n\nMoreover, the correct forum in this case, which deals with purely contractual disputes, is the court of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, as expressly provided for in the terms and conditions of the auctions.26\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 6.\n\n33.\n\nClaimant considers that, when analyzing the objection based on the choice of forum, the relevant proceedings must be compared in order to determine whether the triple identity test requiring identity of parties, cause of action and dispute is met.27 Here, the test would not be met:\n\n- The plaintiff and claimant are not the same person: the local claim was filed by Fideicomiso BAP, whereas the claimant in this arbitration is BA Desarrollos;28\n\n- The breach at issue in one and the other proceeding is different, since this arbitration concerns the breach of the Treaty;29\n\n- The AABE is not even part of the Argentine judicial branch.30\n\nResponse, para. 85.\n\nResponse, para. 78.\n\nResponse, para. 80.\n\nResponse, para. 82.\n\n34.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is willing to accept as a working hypothesis that the same facts \u2013 in this case, the lack of execution of the deeds for some plots \u2013 may give rise to a breach of contract and, at the same time, to a breach of the Treaty. Thus, the fact that there may be an ongoing local proceeding, or a local forum provided for in the terms and conditions of the auctions in order to determine the propriety of the lack of execution of the deeds is not in itself sufficient to deny the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n35.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considers \u2013 as Claimant points out31 \u2013 that this issue is closely intertwined with the merits of the case and, therefore, it would be difficult for it be dealt with separately and in advance as Respondent intends through its bifurcation.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\nResponse, para. 88.\n\n36.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, by majority, considers that the discussion raised by the Parties demonstrates that the jurisdictional objections are not without controversy. Applying the enhanced standard indicated in para. 18 *supra*, the Arbitral Tribunal, by majority,32 does not consider, *prima facie*, after having read the positions of both Parties, that Respondent's objections are of sufficient importance to warrant bifurcation.\n\nArbitrator Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda agrees with the majority with respect to objections 2 (lack of investment) and 3 (choice of forum and local jurisdiction) in the sense that they do not warrant bifurcation of the proceeding for the reasons stated. The dissent lies in the analysis and reasoning with respect to objection 1 (denial of benefits). In the opinion of Arbitrator Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda, Respondent has raised a serious and substantial objection regarding Claimant's control and the degree of importance of its economic activities in the territory of the United States of America. This issue is not related to the facts of Claimant's claim on the merits and, should the objection be upheld, could result in a complete dismissal of the claim.\n\n37.\n\nThis decision is also reached by taking into account the procedural efficiency considerations developed in the following paragraphs.\n\n**4. Procedural efficiency**\n----------------------------\n\n38.\n\nRespondent highlights that, comparing the different Procedural Calendars agreed for the bifurcation and non-bifurcation scenarios, bifurcation would result in a saving of time and costs:33 in case of bifurcation, there is a likelihood of total (or partial) dismissal of the case, without the need to analyze the merits.34\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 82.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras. 82-84.\n\n39.\n\nClaimant compares the Procedural Calendars applicable in the event of bifurcation or non-bifurcation and considers that the saving would be minimal as the merits of the case do not require extensive investigation and, therefore, does not compensate running the risk associated with a bifurcation of unsuccessful jurisdictional objections.35\n\nResponse, para. 113.\n\n40.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that the approach suggested by Claimant is logical, since it takes the Procedural Calendars and uses them as a basis for weighing the procedural gains in the most extreme scenarios:\n\n- If the jurisdictional objections are bifurcated, the hearing would be held in July 2025, i.e., three months before the scheduled hearing date under the joint jurisdictional and merits scenario; therefore, if the Tribunal were to uphold the objections, there would be a procedural saving of (at least) three months;\n\n- If the jurisdictional objections are bifurcated, but unsuccessful, the hearing on the merits will not occur until February 2027 \u2013 which would add, on average, a year and a half to the length of the proceeding.\n\n41.\n\nNon-bifurcation is procedurally more efficient.\n\n42.\n\nIn any case, as Claimant seems to point out, by insisting on non-bifurcation, despite the existence of jurisdictional objections, the risk associated with procedural inefficiency is primarily run by Claimant itself, which is bearing the procedural costs.36 And were Respondent ultimately successful, it may claim its defense costs from Claimant.\n\nResponse, para. 114.\n\n**V. Requests for relief and decision**\n---------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has requested:37\n\n\"In view of the foregoing, [that] the Tribunal \u2026 grant the Request for Bifurcation of the Argentine Republic to address the preliminary objections at a separate stage of the proceedings pursuant to Rule 44(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\"\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 87.\n\n44.\n\nBA Desarrollos requests the following:38\n\n\"\u2026 That the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DENY Argentina's request for bifurcation and proceed with the non-bifurcated procedure set out in Procedural Calendar No 3 in Annex B of Procedural Order No 1; and\n\n(b) ORDER Argentina to pay all costs and expenses incurred by BA Desarrollos in connection with Argentina's Request for Bifurcation.\"\n\nResponse, para. 120.\n\n45.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, by majority, decides not to bifurcate the proceeding and to reserve its decision on the costs arising from this procedural phase until a later date.\n\n46.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds that the present decision determines only whether the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent in its Request for Bifurcation are of sufficient importance to warrant separate proceedings on the merits. In this regard, the conclusions reached by the Arbitral Tribunal in this decision in no way prejudge the content of the objections raised by Respondent.\n\nDate: 9 September 2024"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 9 (Decision on Request for Case Documents)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2025-02-11T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 9 (Decision on Request for Case Documents)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**WHEREAS**\n-----------\n\n1.\n\nOn 22 January 2025 the Tribunal received the United States Government's [\"**United States**\"] application for access to the Notice of Arbitration, the Parties' pleadings and the relevant procedural orders [**\"Request for Case Documents**\"] in order to assess whether to make a non-disputing Treaty party submission [\"**NDP Submission**\"].\n\n2.\n\nOn 24 January 2025 the Tribunal granted the Parties leave to submit their comments on the Request for Case Documents.\n\n3.\n\nOn 31 January 2025 the Tribunal received both Claimant's [\"**Claimant's Response**\"] and Respondent's comments [\"**Respondent's Response**\"].\n\n4.\n\nAfter considering the Parties' respective positions, the Tribunal issues the following Procedural Order deciding on the Request for Case Documents.\n\n**PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 9**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal will first set out the applicable standard (**1.**) before summarising the Request for Case Documents (**2.**) and setting out the Parties' positions (**3.**).

Applicable Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nAs noted by both the United States1 and the Parties2, the relevant norm for a potential NDP Submission is ICSID Arbitration Rule 68 [\"**Rule 68**\"] which states as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall permit a Party to a treaty that is not a party to the dispute (\"non-disputing Treaty Party\") to make a submission on the interpretation of the treaty at issue in the dispute and upon which consent to arbitration is based. The Tribunal may, after consulting with the parties, invite a non-disputing Treaty Party to make such a submission.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall ensure that non-disputing Treaty Party participation does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party. To this end, the Tribunal may impose conditions on the making of the submission by the non-disputing Treaty Party, including with respect to the format, length, scope or publication of the submission, and the time limit to file the submission.\n\n(3) The Tribunal shall provide the non-disputing Treaty Party with relevant documents filed in the proceeding, unless either party objects.\n\n(4) The parties shall have the right to make observations on the submission of the non-disputing Treaty Party.\n\nRequest for Case Documents, p. 1.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 1; Respondent's Response, p. 1.\n\n**2. Request for Case Documents**\n---------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe United States argues that its Request for Case Documents should be accepted as it would allow it to produce an informed and targeted NDP Submission, in turn helping to clarify the meaning of the provisions of the Treaty3. It highlights the wording of Rule 68(3) and its requirement for the Tribunal to grant such a request if neither Party objects. It does, however, acknowledge that the Parties' pleadings are likely to be subject to a confidentiality agreement that would prevent their sharing with a third party; therefore, it seeks to assure the Parties that the pleadings would remain confidential and that it would be prepared to be bound by any such confidentiality agreement4.\n\nRequest for Case Documents, p. 2. Capitalised terms not defined in this communication shall have the definition given to them in the Tribunal's previous decisions.\n\nRequest for Case Documents, pp. 1 \u2013 2.\n\n8.\n\nSubsidiarily, if the Tribunal deems that the United States does not need access to all the requested documents, the United States is open to only reviewing the portions of said documents that the Tribunal deems relevant for a potential NDP Submission on matters of law and treaty interpretation, including receiving redacted documents5.\n\nRequest for Case Documents, p. 2.\n\n**3. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n9.\n\nRespondent used its Response to set out that it has no objections to the Request for Case Documents, without providing further comments6.\n\nRespondent's Response.\n\n10.\n\nClaimant, on the other hand, objects to the Request for Case Documents, arguing that an NDP Submission should be limited to commenting on the interpretation of the Treaty, and not its application to the facts; accordingly, the information in the public domain on the dispute, including the Tribunal's various procedural orders, should suffice for such a purpose. Therefore, it argues that sharing the Parties' pleadings and other documents, which would require redactions due to confidentiality considerations, would be inefficient and produce significant and unnecessary costs7.\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 1 \u2013 2.\n\n11.\n\nTurning to the wording of Rule 68, Claimant argues that the Tribunal has a duty to ensure that the United States' participation in the proceeding does not \"disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either Party\" and that, to this end, the Tribunal may place conditions on any NDP Submission. This being the case, Claimant requests that the United States be limited to a fifteen-page submission filed no later than 21 March 2025 so that its content may be addressed in its Reply Memorial, if necessary8.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 2.\n\n**4. Decision**\n---------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the wording of Rule 68 is unambiguous insofar as non-disputing Treaty parties should be allowed to make an NDP Submission, and that the United States may be invited to do so once the Parties have been consulted9 \u2013 as does not seem to be disputed by either Party. Seeing as the conditions of Rule 68 have been met, it is proper for the Tribunal to allow such a submission.\n\nRule 68(1).\n\n13.\n\nRule 68 does, however, also empower the Tribunal to impose conditions on the NDP Submission in order to ensure that the proceedings are not disrupted or that either Party is unduly burdened or prejudiced10. In light of these considerations, Claimant's proposal that the length of the NDP Submission be limited and that a deadline be imposed seem reasonable. Respondent is therefore invited to confirm whether it agrees to the proposed deadline and pleading lengths by **12 February 2025** or, conversely, provide its own alternatives. The Tribunal will then either confirm the conditions, in the case of agreement, or proceed to make a decision on the appropriate deadline and pleading lengths.\n\nRule 68(2).\n\n14.\n\nOn the issue of the sharing of case documents, Rule 68 is similarly explicit, providing that the Tribunal shall only do so if it has the assent of the Parties11 \u2013 something which has evidently been withheld by Claimant in its Response12. In any case, the Tribunal concurs with Claimant that the United States has access to publicly available information, including redacted versions of the first seven procedural orders13, which it may use to inform its decision on whether to make an NDP Submission.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\nRule 68(2).\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 1 \u2013 2.\n\nSee https://icsid.worldbank.org/cases/case-database/case-detail?CaseNo=ARB/23/32.\n\n15.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal decides to:\n\n- Permit the United States to file an NDP Submission on the interpretation of the Treaty, if it so wishes;\n\n- Invite Respondent to produce its comments on the deadline and pleading length of the NDP Submission by **12 February 2025**; and\n\n- Reject the United States' Request for Case Documents.\n\nDate: 11 February 2025"}]}
