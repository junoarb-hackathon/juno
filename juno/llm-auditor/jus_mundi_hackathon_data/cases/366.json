PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. ARBITRAL PROCEDURE**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 December 2011, Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi (\" **Al Tamimi** \" or \" **the Claimant** \") submitted a Request for Arbitration dated 5 December 2011 (the \" **Request** \") against the Sultanate of Oman (\" **Oman** \" or \" **the Respondent** \").\n\n2.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration was submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\" **ICSID** \") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Sultanate of Oman on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area (the \" **US-Oman FTA** \"), which entered into force on 1 January 2009, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \" **ICSID Convention** \"), which entered into force on 14 October 1966.\n\n3.\n\nThe Request, as supplemented by the Claimant's letter dated 20 December 2011, was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6 and 7 of the ICSID Institution Rules on 23 December 2011. The Secretary-General notified the Parties of the registration on the same day. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n4.\n\nOn 26 March 2012, the Claimant informed ICSID that Claimant's counsel had moved from the law firm of Crowell & Moring LLP to the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. The Claimant informed ICSID on 21 November 2012 that Mr Peter Mansour of Hamad Al Sharji, Peter Mansour & Co. would also be acting for the Claimant in this arbitration. On 5 June 2013, the Claimant informed ICSID that the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP had been appointed to replace the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP as counsel for the Claimant in the arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nPursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant appointed Judge Charles N Brower, a US national, and the Respondent appointed Mr J Christopher Thomas QC, a Canadian national, as arbitrators. The Parties agreed on the appointment of Professor David A R Williams QC, a national of New Zealand, as the third and presiding arbitrator. The Tribunal was constituted on 25 April 2012 in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6.\n\n6.\n\nMs A\u00efssatou Diop, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal. The Parties were subsequently informed on 27 September 2012 that Ms Diop would be replaced as Secretary of the Tribunal by Ms Frauke Nitschke, ICSID Legal Counsel. The Parties were informed on 6 August 2013 that Ms Nitschke would be replaced as Secretary of the Tribunal by Mr Monty Taylor, also ICSID Legal Counsel. On 24 March 2015, the Parties were informed that Ms. Diop would return as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal held a First Session with the Parties via telephone conference on 18 June 2012. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that no Party, as of that date, had any objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal. It was agreed (*inter alia)* that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect as of April 2006 and that the procedural language would be English. The Parties also confirmed their agreement that the legal place of the arbitration is the seat of ICSID in Washington DC. The agreement of the Parties was embodied in Procedural Order No 1 signed by the President of the Tribunal on 13 July 2012 and circulated to the Parties.\n\n8.\n\nOn 25 September 2012, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal issue an order directing the Respondent to grant Claimant's industry and damages experts immediate access to the former quarry site (such site being the subject of this arbitration). The Claimant sought this access so as to allow its experts to inspect the site in connection with the completion of their expert reports.\n\n9.\n\nOn 27 September 2012, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant's request. The Claimant filed a response to those observations on 28 September 2012.\n\n10.\n\nOn 28 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2 concerning the Claimant's application for access to conduct a site inspection. Relevantly, the Tribunal allowed the Claimant's application for a site visit (in general terms), and made directions with a view to the Parties arranging a site visit as soon as possible after 8 October 2012.\n\n11.\n\nThe following day, on 29 September 2012, the Claimant filed a request for the Tribunal to reconsider the timing aspects of Procedural Order No 2. On 29 September 2012, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's request and confirmed the directions contained in that order.\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 October 2012, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 3 concerning the procedural calendar. This order revised sections of the Tribunal's earlier Procedural Order No 1 relating to the schedule for submission of the Parties' pleadings, and to the dates of the final Hearing.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Memorial on jurisdiction and the merits on 16 November 2012. With its Memorial, the Claimant also filed (relevantly): (a) a Witness Statement of Mr Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi dated 15 November 2012; (b) a Witness Statement of Mr Subodh Gupta dated 16 November 2012; (c) a Witness Statement of Mr Francisco Pine Ralutin dated 24 August 2012; and (d) an Expert Report of John T. Boyd Company dated 15 November 2012.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 8 January 2013 the Respondent submitted a request for the Tribunal to decide on the production of certain document categories disputed between the Parties. The Tribunal ruled upon the Respondent's request in its Procedural Order No 4, Rulings on the Respondent's First Request for Production of Documents, dated 5 February 2013.\n\n15.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal ruled upon certain document requests in its Procedural Order No 4, it also deferred its ruling with respect to certain categories of requested documents. Such categories appeared to relate to a possible *ratione personae* objection not yet articulated by the Respondent. As such, in order to rule on those specific categories, and in particular, to determine whether those requests were relevant and material to the outcome of the case, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to file a brief memorandum indicating (among other things) the precise nature of its *ratione personae* challenge, should it intend to make such a challenge in its CounterMemorial. The order also directed the Claimant to file a short memorandum in response to the Respondent's note.\n\n16.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No 4, on 15 February 2013 the Respondent filed its memorandum, and on 22 February 2013 the Claimant filed its reply observations.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal ruled upon the outstanding document requests made by the Respondent in its Procedural Order No 5 dated 15 March 2013. Those requests were denied, although certain reservations were made to this rejection, including that the Tribunal was prepared to revisit the Respondent's requests on better information as to relevant facts and law if such became available at an appropriate stage of the proceeding. The Tribunal also ordered the Claimant to disclose certain official travel documents.\n\n18.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 6 concerning the procedural calendar for the arbitration.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on 5 June 2013, which included its objections to jurisdiction. With its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent also filed: (a) a Witness Statement of Dr Ghalib bin Abdullah Al Rushdi dated 4 June 2013; (b) a Witness Statement of Mr Ali Al Waily dated 5 June 2013; (c) a Witness Statement of H E Maqbool Bin Ali Sultan dated 5 June 2013; (d) a Witness Statement of Mr Adriaan Hendrick \"Henk\" Van der Wiele dated 5 June 2013; (e) an Expert Report of Mr Brent Kaczmarek, of Navigant Consulting Inc, dated 5 June 2013; and (f) an Expert Report of RungePincockMinarco dated 5 June 2013.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 5 August 2013 the Claimant filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the production of documents. The Tribunal ruled on these requests by order dated 21 August 2013, entitled \"Rulings on Claimant's Requests for Production of Documents\".\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Reply on jurisdiction and the merits on 1 November 2013. The Claimant's Reply was filed with the following witness statements and expert reports: (a) a Second Witness Statement of Mr Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi dated 1 November 2013; (b) a Second Witness Statement of Mr Subodh Gupta dated both 20 October 2013 and 1 November 2013; (c) an Expert Report of Mr Sari Alabdulrazzak, of MEED Insight, dated 1 November 2013; (d) an Expert Report of Mr Robert D Archibald, of Archibald Consulting Group, dated 1 November 2013; and (e) a Second Expert Report of John Boyd Co, dated 1 November 2013.\n\n22.\n\nOn 11 February 2014, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 7 concerning the procedural calendar.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 11 March 2014 together with: (a) a Supplemental Witness Statement of Mr Ali Al Waily; (b) a Supplemental Witness Statement of Dr Ghalib bin Abdullah Al Rushdi; (c) a Supplemental Witness Statement of Mr Adriaan Hendrick \"Henk\" Van der Wiele dated 6 March 2014; (d) a Witness Statement of H E Ahmed Al Dheeb; (e) a Witness Statement of Mr Mamoun al Zubair Abdul Rahman; (f) a Supplemental Expert Report of Mr Brent Kaczmarek, of Navigant Consulting Inc, dated 11 March 2014; (g) a Supplemental Expert Report of RungePincockMinarco dated 11 March 2014; and (h) an Expert Report of Ms Delia Meth-Cohn, of Elite Media Inc, dated 10 March 2014.\n\n24.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No 7, on 14 April 2014 both the Claimant and the Respondent filed a Pre-Hearing Skeleton. On 15 April 2014, the Parties filed an agreed chronology. On the same day, each of the Parties also filed with the Tribunal a list of issues.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal held a Pre-Hearing Organisational Meeting with the Parties by telephone conference on 16 April 2014.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 8 and Procedural Order No 9 on 18 April 2014. The first issued order (Procedural Order No 8) concerned an expert report of JAJ Consultants LLC dated 10 November 2012. This report, which had been prepared on instructions from the Claimant, was attached to the Expert Report of John T Boyd Company dated 15 November 2012 (filed with the Claimant's Memorial). The Respondent had requested on 15 April 2014 that this report should remain on the record, and in its order, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's application by consent. As to the second order (Procedural Order No 9), this provided the Tribunal's rulings on the Claimant's additional requests for production of documents dated 24 March 2014.\n\n27.\n\nAlso on 18 April 2014, the Claimant sought the Tribunal's permission to submit certain specified documents to the record. At the invitation of the Tribunal, on 23 April 2014 the Respondent submitted observations on the Claimant's request. The Tribunal ruled upon the request in its Procedural Order No 10 dated 24 April 2014.\n\n28.\n\nA Hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London, United Kingdom, from 28 April to 8 May 2014.

This transcript was later issued, as corrected and approved by the Parties on 6 June 2014 and as confirmed by the Tribunal on 21 August 2014.\n\n31.\n\nOn 26 May 2014, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 11 concerning certain post-Hearing procedural matters. Relevantly, the order scheduled a list of questions and issues to be addressed by the Parties. In accordance with the Tribunal's direction, on 30 June 2014 each Party filed its respective answers to the Tribunal's list of questions and issues.\n\n32.\n\nOn 22 September 2014, the United States of America filed a written submission as a nondisputing State Party pursuant to the US-Oman FTA, Article 10.19.2, on two issues of treaty interpretation. On 24 September 2014, the Claimant objected to the submission on the grounds that: (a) it was untimely; and/or (b) it exceeded the United States' permitted scope of participation under the FTA. Claimant also sought leave to respond substantively to the submission. On 26 September 2014, the Respondent submitted that the Tribunal should accept the submission, arguing that: (a) allowing the submission would cause no prejudice to the Claimant; and (b) the submission was directed to issues of treaty interpretation only. The Respondent opposed the Claimant's request to respond to the submission, submitting that it was not necessary for either party to respond. By letter dated 29 September 2014, the United States argued that its submission was neither untimely nor outside the scope of Article 10.19.2.\n\n33.\n\nOn 14 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 12 admitting the United States' submission into the record, finding, with respect to the issue of timing, that the submission was filed within a reasonable time. With respect to the issue of scope, the Tribunal directed the parties to exchange memoranda discussing: (a) whether the submission fell within the scope of Article 10.19.2; and (b) the substance of the submission and its relevance, if any, to this case. The Tribunal ruled that it would undertake the question of what weight, if any, to give to the United States' submission at the time of its deliberations. On 31 October 2014, each party filed its response to the submission of the United States.\n\n34.\n\nRegarding the Parties' submissions on costs, the Tribunal announced at the conclusion of the Hearing that it would defer submissions on this matter until a later date.2 The Tribunal reiterated this position in Procedural Order No 11. By letter of 4 February 2015, the Tribunal invited the parties to file submissions on costs by 4 March 2015. The parties later agreed to extend that time by two days, as approved by the Tribunal.\n\nSee Transcript, Day 9 at 226:16.\n\n35.\n\nThe parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on 6 March 2015. On 9 March 2015, the Claimant filed a corrected submission on costs. The same day, the Parties agreed to submit replies to each other's submissions, as approved by the Tribunal. On 16 March 2015, the Parties filed simultaneous reply submissions on costs.\n\n36.\n\nOn 15 September 2015, the Tribunal requested that the Parties file updated submissions on costs strictly limited to updating the quantum of costs. On 16 September 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no further updates in this regard. On 22 September 2015, the Claimant filed its updated submission on costs.\n\n37.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 19 October 2015.\n\n**B.

SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe following summary is intended to provide a general overview of factual background to the dispute between the Parties. It is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered relevant by the Tribunal. Further relevant factual material will be addressed in the context of the Tribunal's analysis of the issues in dispute below.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant, Mr Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi,4 is a US citizen born in Ajman, one of the seven emirates which make up the present United Arab Emirates (\" **UAE** \"). Mr Al Tamimi is a civil engineer who, since the 1970s, has worked in construction management and real estate development, primarily in New England in the United States.\n\nAlso previously known as Adel Abdul-Amir Fadili: see First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [3].\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent, the Sultanate of Oman, is a country located on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula, bordered by the UAE, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Republic of Yemen.\n\n48.\n\nThis proceeding arises out of the Claimant's investment in the development and operation of a limestone quarry in the Jebel Wasa mountain range, located in the municipality of Mahda, Oman. Mr Al Tamimi's interest in quarrying in Oman was reportedly sparked by the discovery that Nakheel Properties, a real estate development company owned by the Dubai government, was looking for quarry operators to help fill its demand for large quantities of limestone, and had been negotiating with the Omani government to establish a hard rock quarry near the UAE-Oman Border.5\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [37].\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimant's investment was created through two Lease Agreements signed between, respectively, his companies Emrock Aggregate & Mining LLC (\" **Emrock** \") and SFOH Limited (\" **SFOH** \"), and the Omani state-owned enterprise Oman Mining Company LLC (\" **OMCO** \").\n\n50.\n\nEmrock was established and registered in Oman pursuant to the laws of Dubai, UAE on 14 June 2006.6 The Claimant served as both General Manager and Chairman of Emrock. The Claimant owned a 49% shareholding in the Company and was apparently entitled to 80% of the profits generated by Emrock by virtue of Emrock's Memorandum of Association.7 The Claimant is said to have exercised sole decision-making power on behalf of Emrock as its General Manager.8\n\nMemorandum of Association of Emrock Aggregate & Mining LLC among Eurogulf LLC and Atlas Capital Limited, dated 14 June 2006 (**Exhibit J-063**).\n\n**Exhibit J-063** ; Amendment to the Memorandum of Association of Emrock Aggregate & Mining (LLC) between Mr Mashaal Sediq Abdullah, Mr Adel A Fadili and Atlas Capital Limited, dated 16 April 2007 (**Exhibit J-094**). A portion of Mr Al Tamimi's shares in Emrock were held indirectly through another company, Atlas Capital Limited, fully owned by Mr Al Tamimi.\n\nSee **Exhibit J-063**, Art 11.1.\n\n51.\n\nSFOH was established on 15 May 2006 pursuant to the laws of the Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai, UAE.9 SFOH was owned and controlled entirely by the Claimant, who held 100% of the shares in the company.10\n\nMemorandum of Association of SFOH Limited, dated 15 May 2006 (**Exhibit J-054**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [21].\n\n52.\n\nOMCO was established by Royal Decree No 11/81 in 1981.11 It is a State-owned enterprise, owned almost entirely by the Omani Ministry of Oil and Minerals, established to facilitate the discovery, excavation, manufacturing and marketing of minerals in Oman. OMCO's Board of Directors comprises five members. Mr Ali Al Waily served as OMCO's Executive Manager from 2005 to 2009. Dr Hilal Al Azri, Director-General of Mining at the Omani Ministry of Commerce and Industry (\" **MOCI** \"), served as Chairman of OMCO until late 2008. H E Ahmed Al Dheeb succeeded Dr Al Azri as Chairman of OMCO in late 2008.12\n\nRoyal Decree No 11/81 (**CLA-002**).\n\nOman's Counter Memorial at [172].\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant entered into negotiations with OMCO regarding the Jebel Wasa site after being introduced to Mr Al Waily of OMCO by the Chief Engineer and Manager of Rock Procurement of Nakheel Properties, Mr Saad Ibrahim, in 2005.13 OMCO subsequently wrote to MOCI on 23 November 2005 requesting \" *authorisation for drilling activities* \" for limestone in the Jebel Wasa area.14\n\nRequest at [22]-[23]; Claimant's Memorial at [39].\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Azri, dated 23 November 2005 (**Exhibit J-035**).\n\n54.\n\nEmrock and OMCO executed a conditional lease agreement for the Jebel Wasa quarry site on 12 December 2005, pending the approval of OMCO's Board of Directors. OMCO's Board approved the agreement on 13 February 2006, and the final agreement (the \" **OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement** \") was concluded on 8 April 2006.15 SFOH and OMCO executed a lease agreement for the Jebel Wasa quarry site on 25 May 2006 which was virtually identical in its terms to the Emrock-OMCO Lease Agreement (the \" **OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement** \"), with the exception that under the terms of the latter agreement an area of 4km\u00b2 of the Jebel Wasa quarry site was demised to SFOH, rather than the 2km\u00b2 area demised to Emrock.16\n\nAgreement of Lease for Limestone Quarrying Project between Oman Mining Company LLC and Emrock Aggregate & Mining LLC, dated 8 April 2006 (**Exhibit J-048**).\n\nAgreement of Lease for Limestone Quarrying Project between Oman Mining Company LLC and SFOH LLC, dated 25 May 2006 (**Exhibit J-058**). See also fn 791 below for further discussion on this point.\n\n55.\n\nThe OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements each provided that OMCO would use its \" *best endeavors* \" to obtain the requisite environmental and operating permits for the quarry.17 The Lease Agreements further provided that they would each come into force upon the obtaining of all permits, licences and access in respect of the Jebel Wasa quarry site.18 Emrock and SFOH agreed under the Lease Agreements to comply with all obligations imposed by the relevant permit, and agreed to indemnify OMCO \" *at all times* \" against any claims, demands and liability in respect thereof.19 Emrock and SFOH further agreed to comply with all environmental, mining and crushing requirements and all other laws of the Sultanate of Oman.20 The Lease Agreements provided for termination by either party in case of substantial breach, and provided for the \" *exclusive jurisdiction* \" of the Oman Arbitration Centre in the event of a dispute between the parties relating to \" *any aspect of the contractual relationship* \".21\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 4(ii); **Exhibit J-058**, Art 4(ii).\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 9(iii); **Exhibit J-058**, Art 9(iii).\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 8(iii); **Exhibit J-058**, Art 8(iii).\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 9(vii); **Exhibit J-058**, Art 9(vii).\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Arts 10(iii), 11; **Exhibit J-058**, Arts 10(iii), 11.\n\n56.\n\nThe Lease Agreements required Emrock and SFOH each to pay OMCO a royalty of 5% of gross revenue.22 The Lease Agreements also required the payment of monthly lease payments by each company to OMCO.23 The term of each Lease Agreement was ten years, renewable for three additional terms of five years each.24 The purpose of the Lease Agreements was stated to be for \" *limestone and other stone materials quarrying and crushing operations* \".25\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 6(ii)(a); **Exhibit J-058**, Art 6(ii)(a).\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 6(ii)(b); **Exhibit J-058**, Art 6(ii)(b).\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 3; **Exhibit J-058**, Art 3.\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Preamble; **Exhibit J-058**, Preamble.\n\n57.\n\nEmrock and SFOH subsequently entered into an Agreement for the Production of Limestone Quarrying and Crushing on 15 January 2007 (the \" **Joint Production Agreement** \").26 Under the terms of the Joint Production Agreement, Emrock undertook general responsibility for quarrying and crushing operations, while SFOH undertook responsibility to prepare the site,27 and to provide for necessary materials and permits for the quarry's operation.28\n\nAgreement for Production of Limestone Quarrying and Crushing Project between SFOH and Emrock Aggregate & Mining LLC, dated 15 January 2007 (**Exhibit J-087**).\n\n**Exhibit J-087**, Art 8.\n\n**Exhibit J-087**, Art 5.\n\n58.\n\nOn 1 April 2006, Emrock entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\" **MoU** \") with Nakheel Properties to supply it with 15 million tonnes of rock annually for 10 years for the purpose of \" *various projects in Dubai* \".29\n\nMemorandum of Understanding between Nakheel Properties and Emrock Aggregate & Mining LLC, dated 1 April 2006 (**Exhibit J-047**). A later Supply Contract entered into between Emrock and Nakheel Properties on 9 September 2007 reduced the supply to a minimum of 1.5 million tonnes of rock per annum: Agreement of Purchase and Supply and Rock, Art. 1.1 (**Exhibit J-113**).\n\n59.\n\nIn or around November 2006, OMCO, on behalf of Emrock and SFOH, submitted an Application for an Environmental Permit for the Jebel Wasa quarry site (\" **AEP** \"), along with an Environmental Impact Assessment (\" **EIA** \") and Environmental Management Plan (\" **EMP** \"), to the Omani Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs (\" **MECA** \").30 These documents, which had been prepared with the assistance of environmental consultancy firm GEO-Resources, addressed the anticipated environmental impacts of the proposed quarrying project and mitigating measures to be implemented.31\n\nPrior to September 2007, MECA formed part of a larger Ministry of Regional Municipalities, Environment and Water Resources (\" **MRMEWR** \"). For convenience's sake, the two entities shall herein be referred to only as MECA, but such reference should be understood to refer to MRMEWR prior to September 2007.\n\nSee discussion below at fn 843 regarding the various versions of the EIA documents prepared by the Claimant.\n\n60.\n\nOn 8 January 2007, OMCO wrote to inform Emrock and SFOH that MOCI had given permission for the quarrying operation to begin, pending the issuing of an environmental permit by MECA.32 Emrock and SFOH subsequently began making necessary purchases, preparations and plans for the operation of the quarry site, including designing and establishing drilling and blasting benches, cutting out and building internal roads, and constructing the camp site and supporting facilities.33\n\nLetter from OMCO to Emrock, dated 8 January 2007 (**Exhibit J-083**); Letter from OMCO to SFOH, dated 8 January 2007 (**Exhibit J-084**).\n\nRequest at [35]; Claimant's Memorial at [58].\n\n61.\n\nOn 3 March 2007, MECA wrote to MOCI to advise that MECA had no objection to the proposed quarry provided it did not exceed a total area of 2km x 2km.34 On 5 March 2007, the Omani Ministry of Housing (\" **MOH** \") issued to OMCO a usufruct contract containing a map (\" *krooki* \") of the concession comprising a total area of 14.7 km\u00b2. On 25 April 2007, MECA issued an initial environmental permit to OMCO for the Jebel Wasa quarry.35 On 29 May 2007, the municipality of Mahda confirmed to OMCO that it had no objection to the Claimant's quarrying activities.36 On 31 May 2007, OMCO provided to the Claimant a Quarrying Agreement issued by MOCI, along with a Certificate of Quarry Operation (also referred to as a \" *quarry license* \"), to establish the limestone quarry at Jebel Wasa.37\n\nLetter from Mr Al Muharammi to MOCI, dated 3 March 2007 (**Exhibit J-089**).\n\nMRMEWR, Initial Environmental Approval, Project No 9353/ZH, dated 25 April 2007 (**Exhibit J-095**).\n\nLetter from Mayor Shemsi to OMCO, dated 29 May 2007 (**Exhibit J-100**).\n\nCertificate for the Issuance of License No 1/1/39/2007 G to Establish (Quarry for Rock Extraction) and License Contract for the Establishment of a Quarry, effective 27 May 2007 (**Exhibit J-103**).\n\n62.\n\nOn 22 August 2007, having received the initial environmental permit from MECA and the Certificate of Quarrying Operation from MOCI, OMCO instructed Mr Al Tamimi by letter that Emrock and SFOH could begin quarrying operations on 1 September 2007.38 The letters from OMCO to Emrock and SFOH of 22 August 2007 also reminded Mr Al Tamimi that he was authorised to mine only \" *Quarry strata seams and beds of*  ***limestone*** \" and that he was limited to the \" *exploitation of limestone rock products only* \".39 The Claimant accordingly commenced quarrying operations at the Jebel Wasa quarry on 1 September 2007.40\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi (Emrock), dated 22 August 2007 (**Exhibit J-108**); Letter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi (SFOH), dated 22 August 2007 (**Exhibit J-109**).\n\n**Exhibit J-108** ; **Exhibit J-109** (original emphasis).\n\nRequest at [39]; Memorial at [71].\n\n63.\n\nVery quickly, however, the relationship between the Claimant, OMCO and MECA and MOCI deteriorated. This situation culminated in the decision of OMCO to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement by letter of 20 July 2008.41 In addition, OMCO informed the Claimant on 2 June 2008 that it regarded the OMCO-SFHO Lease Agreement as \" *null and void* \", as a result of the Claimant's failure to register SFOH in accordance with the laws of Oman.42 A second termination letter from OMCO to Emrock followed on 17 February 2009.43 Ultimately, on 23 May 2009, the Royal Oman Police arrested the Claimant at the request of MECA for allegedly conducting operations outside of his permitted boundaries, operating without the necessary permits, and removing material from the dry riverbed to the west of the Jebel Wasa mountain range (the \" *Wadi Sumayni* \", hereinafter \" ***wadi*** \").44\n\nLetter from Mr Al Azri to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 20 July 2008 (**Exhibit J-199**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 2 June 2008 (**Exhibit J-182**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 17 February 2009 (**Exhibit J-250**).\n\nSee Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed, 1989) at 795-796 (wadi, wady [Arab.: wadi] *; \"In certain Arabic-speaking countries, a ravine or valley which in the rainy season becomes a watercourse; the stream or torrent running through* *such a ravine* \") (**CLA-082**).\n\n64.\n\nPrior to these events, MOCI and MECA had issued a number of complaints, warnings and fines against OMCO/Emrock, beginning before the Claimant's quarrying operations had even formally begun, and continuing until Mr Al Tamimi's ultimate arrest in May 2009. The reasons behind the complaints and orders were varied and included, but were not limited to, the Claimant's alleged unauthorised use of equipment, excavation of material from the *wadi*, operating outside of the boundary of the permit, and blasting outside of the concession area.45\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [4].\n\n65.\n\nOn 8 August 2007, for example, MECA issued a complaint pertaining to Emrock's use of a screen.46 On 28 August 2007, OMCO wrote to Mr Al Tamimi alleging that Emrock was in \"*clear violation\"* of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement by *\"processing material originating in the alluvial deposits located in the area's streams*\".47 On 22 September 2007, MOCI issued a notice to OMCO that its experts had observed during a site visit that the Claimant was working beyond the borders of the delimited site.48 On 29 September 2007, OMCO wrote to Mr Al Tamimi advising that Emrock was engaging in blasting outside the perimeters of OMCO's concession.49 MECA issued further infringement notices to OMCO on 7 October 2007 and 24 October 2007.50 On 25 December 2007, MECA issued an infraction report and fined OMCO RO 2,000.51\n\nLetter from OMCO to Mr Gupta, dated 8 August 2007 (**Exhibit J-106**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 28 August 2007 (**Exhibit J-110**).\n\nLetter from H E Dr Al Hinai to OMCO, dated 22 September 2007 (**Exhibit J-115**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 29 September 2007 (**Exhibit J-117**).\n\nLetter from MECA to Mr Al Waily, dated 7 October 2007 (**Exhibit J-123**) and Letter from MECA to OMCO, dated 24 October 2007 (**Exhibit J-127**).\n\nInfraction Report, Serial No 03640, dated 25 December 2007 (**Exhibit J-138**).\n\n66.\n\nSubsequently, the Director-General of Industry at MOCI, H E Dr Al Hinai, wrote to OMCO, in a letter dated 12 November 2007, stating that the quarry boundary was that specified in the Quarry Agreement and Certificate of Quarrying Operation issued by MOCI.52 In February 2008, a meeting took place between the Claimant, the Director-General for Environmental Affairs at MECA, H E Al Maharrami, the OMCO Chairman, Dr Hilal Al Azri, and the Managing Director of GEO-Resources.53 It was agreed that OMCO would \" *apply* [for] *and obtain permission for extension of the mining concession area incorporating the location of the screen plant and wadi area for the production of wadi products* \".54 In a letter dated 17 February 2008, OMCO asked MOCI for an extension of the worksite and for \" *approval to produce sand materials* \".55 The Claimant subsequently continued quarrying activities at Jebel Wasa, but on 22 April 2008 OMCO wrote to Mr Al Tamimi again alleging that he had engaged in the unauthorised excavation of *wadi* materials and warning that if he did not cease this activity within one week, OMCO would terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.56\n\nLetter from H E Dr Al Hinai to Mr Al Waily, dated 12 November 2007 (**Exhibit J-128**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [84].\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 17 February 2008 (**Exhibit J-157**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to MOCI, dated 17 February 2008 (**Exhibit J-158**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Azri to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 22 April 2008 (**Exhibit J-171**).\n\n67.\n\nOn 21 April 2008, MOCI issued a RO 10,000 fine against OMCO for alleged failure to \" *observe the boundaries of the leased site as previously determined* \" and demanded that the Claimant cease such operations immediately.57 Mr Al Tamimi has claimed that he voluntarily ceased all production in the *wadi* at this time.58 OMCO paid the RO 10,000 fine and sought reimbursement from Mr Al Tamimi. Mr Al Tamimi offered to reimburse OMCO, but only if it would provide him with copies of the permits it had obtained to date.59 Mr Al Tamimi additionally sought a meeting with the Minister of Commerce and Industry, H E Maqbool Bin Ali Sultan, to discuss matters. This meeting took place on 12 June 2008, attended by, *inter alia*, H E Maqbool Bin Ali Sultan, Mr Al Tamimi, Dr Al Azri, Chairman of OMCO, and H E Dr Al Hinai, Director-General of Industry at MOCI. Mr Al Tamimi has alleged that he was informed by Dr Al Hinai following this meeting that OMCO was responsible for payment of fines, and that Emrock should not reimburse OMCO for the RO 10,000 fine of April 2008.60\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 30 April 2008 (**Exhibit J-176**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [89].\n\nLetter from Mr Al Tamimi to Mr Al Waily, dated 14 July 2008 (**Exhibit J-195**).\n\nFirst Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [142]-[143].\n\n68.\n\nOn 22 June 2008, however, OMCO wrote to Mr Al Tamimi demanding reimbursement of the fine on or before 24 June 2008, stating that failure to comply would be deemed to constitute grounds for termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.61 By letter of 13 July 2008 headed \" *Long Overdue Payments* \", Mr Al Waily demanded that Mr Al Tamimi \" *settle all outstanding amounts overdue to OMCO* \" within five days, or else OMCO would \" *be forced to exercise their right as per the contract terms* \".62 Mr Al Tamimi did not reimburse OMCO for the fine, instead referring OMCO to the advice he said had been earlier given to him by Dr Al Hinai and requiring that he first receive copies of OMCO's permits.63\n\nLetter from OMCO to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 22 June 2008 (**Exhibit J-190**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 13 July 2008 (**Exhibit J-194**).\n\nSee First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [144]; **Exhibit J-195**.\n\n69.\n\nOn 20 July 2008, OMCO purported to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement for failure by Emrock to comply with payment obligations, including, *inter alia*, failure to indemnify OMCO for the RO 10,000 fine which had been levied by MOCI in April 2008.64\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 20 July 2008 (**Exhibit J-198**).\n\n70.\n\nIn addition, on 2 June 2008, OMCO informed the Claimant that it considered the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement to be \" *null and void* \", because SFOH had failed to register in Oman as required by OMCO's letter of 22 August 2007.65\n\n**Exhibit J-182**.\n\n71.\n\nDespite the purported termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 20 July 2008, the Claimant continued operations in the Jebel Wasa quarry site. On or around 28 July 2008, the Claimant met with H E Al Maimani, Undersecretary for Administrative & Financial and Regional Affairs at MOCI.66 The Claimant says that he was told by H E Al Maimani that he could continue to operate at the Jebel Wasa quarry.67 H E Ahmed Al Dheeb, Undersecretary for MOCI, also wrote to H E Dr Al Azri, Chairman of OMCO, on 10 August 2008 stating that the Ministry believed the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement should continue.68 The OMCO Board of Directors subsequently decided to reconsider its decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, and met with the Minister of Commerce, H E Maqbool Bin Ali Sultan, on 23 September 2008 to discuss the decision to terminate.69\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [153].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [101].\n\nLetter from H E Al Dheeb to H E Dr Al Azri, dated 10 August 2008 (**Exhibit J-204**).

In early February 2009, MECA issued a number of further citations against OMCO in respect of Emrock's alleged actions in taking material from the *wadi*, operating machinery without necessary permits, failure to obtain permits for housing, and uprooting trees.76 The fines attached to these citations totalled RO 12,500. Following the issuing of these citations, OMCO again instructed Emrock to cease *wadi* production and, on 17 February 2009, purported again to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on a variety of grounds, including that Emrock had failed to comply with payment obligations allegedly totalling RO 35,440,435.77 OMCO additionally sent Emrock a \" *demobilization plan* \" of the same date, requiring that the Claimant immediately cease operations at the Jebel Wasa quarry site and \" *remove all their equipments* [sic] *, installations and accommodations* \" from the site.78\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 3 March 2009 (**Exhibit J-257**).\n\n**Exhibit J-250**.\n\nSecond letter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 17 February 2009 (**Exhibit J-249**).\n\n75.\n\nOn 15 March 2009, OMCO wrote to inform Emrock that it considered Emrock's continued presence at the quarry site to be illegal and stated that Emrock had 30 further days to vacate the premises.79 A further letter to this effect followed on 18 March 2009.80 On 19 April 2009, after the expiry of the 30-day period, OMCO again wrote to Emrock reiterating that it considered that Emrock remained on the quarry site illegally and instructed Mr Al Tamimi to contact the Public Prosecutor in connection with Emrock's alleged breaches of Oman's environmental laws.81\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 15 March 2009 (**Exhibit J-266**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi dated 18 March 2009 (**Exhibit J-268**).\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 19 April 2009 (**Exhibit J-277**).\n\n76.\n\nMeanwhile, on 8 April 2009, Mr Al Tamimi wrote to H E Hamoud Al Busaidi, Minister for Environment and Climate Affairs, asking him to intervene on Emrock's behalf.82 Shortly thereafter, on 13 April 2009, Dr Al Rushdi, Director of the Legal Department at MECA, visited the quarry site for an inspection.83 On 19 May 2009, Mr Al Muharrami, Director-General of Environmental Affairs at MECA, contacted the Royal Oman Police to request that they intervene to stop operations at Jebel Wasa quarry \" *in order to force the Company to comply with the laws and environmental requirements till the competent judicial authority issue* [sic] *a decision* \".84\n\nLetter from Mr Al Tamimi to H E Al Busaidi, dated 8 April 2009 (**Exhibit J-274**).\n\nFirst Al Rushdi Witness Statement at [28]-[29].\n\nLetter from Mr Al Muharrami to Colonel Al Naaemi, dated 19 May 2009 (**Exhibit J-292**).\n\n77.\n\nMr Al Tamimi was arrested at the Jebel Wasa quarry site by the Royal Oman Police on 23 May 2009. He was held at a local police station for several hours, where he was photographed, fingerprinted and questioned by police. He was also taken to meet with a local prosecutor. Mr Al Tamimi was ultimately informed that he would be released from custody provided he submitted his US passport, posted RO 5,000 as bail, and signed an undertaking regarding future quarry operations.85 Mr Al Tamimi agreed to sign this undertaking, and was released by police after promising to provide the bail money and his passport the following day. Mr Yasser Al Bulushi, Emrock's head of government affairs, subsequently delivered the bond payment and passport to police.86 Mr Al Tamimi's passport was later returned to him by the Public Prosecutor at the request of his lawyers.87\n\nRequest at [59].

By virtue of his position as Chairman of Emrock, Mr Al Tamimi was tried and convicted by the Court on 8 November 2009 on two misdemeanour counts: (a) stealing sands and stones without a permit; and (b) violating Omani environmental law by engaging in quarrying and crushing operations without the requisite permissions.88 The Claimant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three months and fined RO 3,050. While the Court ordered that the fine should be collected, Mr Al Tamimi's sentence of imprisonment was suspended.\n\nMahda Court of First Instance, Judgment No 114/2009 in Case No 74/2009 (**Exhibit J-327**).\n\n79.\n\nMr Al Tamimi subsequently filed an appeal with the Ibri Court of Appeal against his conviction by the Mahda Court of First Instance. On 6 June 2010, the Ibri Court of Appeal issued a judgment overturning Mr Al Tamimi's conviction on both misdemeanour counts. The decision of the Ibri Court of Appeal was not appealed to the Omani Court of Cassation.\n\n80.\n\nMeanwhile, on 26 September 2009, while the first decision of the Mahda Court of First Instance was still pending, MECA filed four additional statements of claim with the Public Prosecutor relating to outstanding violations and fines against Emrock. Those four claims were also subsequently tried by the Mahda Court of First Instance, in separate proceedings from the first criminal trial against Mr Al Tamimi. In its ruling of 25 April 2010, the Court found Mr Al Tamimi, again in his capacity as Chairman of Emrock, liable on all charges, and fined him RO 1,500.89 This decision was not appealed to the Ibri Court of Appeal.\n\nLetter from Sultanate of Oman Public Prosecution Office to MECA, dated 15 May 2010, attaching Judgment of Case Nos 147, 148, 149 and 150 (**Exhibit J-353**).\n\n81.\n\nIn March 2009, MECA also laid three claims with the Public Prosecutor against OMCO for violations of environmental laws.90 On 28 July 2009, the Mahda Court of First Instance ruled on these claims, finding that the claims should have been filed against Emrock as the independent party in control of the Jebel Wasa quarry site and not against OMCO.91\n\nStatement of Claim of Lawsuit No 223, dated 3 March 2009 (**Exhibit J-258**); Statement of Claim of Lawsuit No 224, dated 3 March 2009 (**Exhibit J-259**); Statement of Claim of Lawsuit No 225, dated 7 March 2009 (**Exhibit J-262**).\n\nMahda Court of First Instance, Judgment No 33/C/A/2009 in Case No 224/2009 (**Exhibit J-315**); Mahda Court of First Instance, Judgment No 34/C/A/2009 in Case No 225/2009 (**Exhibit J-316**); Mahda Court of First Instance, Judgment No 32/C/A/2009 in Case No 223/2009 (**Exhibit J-317**).\n\n82.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, production of limestone at the Jebel Wasa quarry site permanently ceased on the date of his arrest, 23 May 2009.92 Emrock continued, however, to sell surplus inventory to buyers, who brought their trucks to the site to collect the limestone.93 The Royal Oman Police allegedly intervened on repeated occasions to stop this process, claiming that Emrock had no legal right to continue to occupy the Jebel Wasa quarry site.94\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [136].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [137].\n\nSee eg Ralutin Witness Statement at [33].\n\n83.\n\nThese police interventions allegedly made it difficult for Emrock to continue any operations at the quarry site. Over time, Emrock's staff were suspended and left the quarry site. Emrock's creditors reportedly seized much of the equipment remaining at the quarry site.95 Mr Francisco Ralutin, Site Office Manager for Emrock, tendered his resignation on 1 March 2010.96 By April 2010, according to the Claimant, none of Emrock's staff remained on the quarry site.97\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [139], [184].\n\nLetter from Mr Ralutin to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 1 March 2010 (**Exhibit J-344**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [138].\n\n84.\n\nMr Al Tamimi commenced proceedings against Oman by filing a Request for Arbitration on 5 December 2011.\n\n**V. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims raised by Mr Al Tamimi in this proceeding. The Tribunal sets out the Parties' arguments below with respect to the Respondent's objections.\n\n**(a) Jurisdiction** ***ratione personae***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent submits that the Claimant may be a dual national of the US and UAE, and as such may not qualify as an investor for the purposes of the US-Oman FTA.98 The Respondent did not present oral argument on this objection at the Hearing, but confirmed at the Hearing that the objection had not been withdrawn.99 As such, the Tribunal will address and determine this objection on the basis of the Parties' arguments set out in their written submissions.\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [263]-[266]. The objection was first raised by the Respondent in its initial Request for Documents and Information dated 8 January 2013, and then considered by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No 5 dated 15 March 2013 for the limited purpose of determining the Respondent's document requests.\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 224; further confirmed in Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer A.1.\n\n87.\n\nIn short, the Respondent submits that, as Mr Al Tamimi appears to be a US-UAE dual national, the Claimant should be deemed an exclusive national of the UAE for the purposes of Article 10.27 of the US-Oman FTA, and as such should be precluded from claiming under that agreement.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 10.27 relevantly defines an *\"investor of a Party\u2019* as follows: \"[...] *a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality\"*. The Respondent contends that, as Mr Al Tamimi had previously stated that he was a national of the UAE,100 and as it remains unclear whether Mr Al Tamimi has lost or still retains that citizenship, he may be deemed an exclusive national of the UAE and hence not a covered \" *investor of a Party*\u00a0\" for the purposes of the US-Oman FTA.\n\nNotice of Intent at [7].\n\n**(ii) Claimant's position**\n----------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimant takes a different view of this issue. The Claimant contends that, even if he had become a UAE national involuntarily when the UAE was formed in 1971 (the Claimant was born a citizen of the Emirate of Sharjah and, according to the Claimant, did nothing to claim UAE citizenship when the UAE was formed), he lost that nationality as a matter of both US and UAE law when he became naturalised as an American citizen on 11 June 1980.101 The Claimant contends that the documents conclusively establish that he was (and is) a US citizen and that at all relevant times he held himself out as such;102 in the latter respect the Claimant notes that his nationality is listed uniformly and unconditionally as \" *American* \" in all registration documents filed with the UAE and Omani authorities.103\n\nClaimant's Reply at [125]-[129].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [39].

The present dispute, moreover, concerns measures adopted or maintained by Oman on or after 1 January 2009 relating to the Claimant and his covered investments, which the Claimant alleges caused him to suffer loss.109 As to why the Claimant submits that his investments continued in existence as of the date of entry into force of the US-Oman FTA, again see the summary under the \" *Jurisdiction ratione temporis* \u2019 heading below.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [160]-[161].\n\n**(c) Jurisdiction** ***ratione temporis***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements are not \" *covered investments*\u00a0\" for the purposes of the US-Oman FTA.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the US-Oman FTA relevantly provides that a \" *covered investment*\u00a0\" under that instrument requires that the purported investment comport with Omani laws and be \" *in existence as of the date of entry into force of*\u00a0\" the FTA (ie 1 January 2009).110 Oman claims that the Claimant's alleged investments fail to meet this requirement.111\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [267].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [268]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [27].\n\n98.\n\nDealing first with the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement, the Respondent alleges that such agreement never came into force because SFOH was never registered in Oman.112 Such registration was allegedly required both under (a) Omani law, and (b) the terms of the agreement.113\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [269]; Oman's Rejoinder at [68].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [269], [276]; Oman's Rejoinder at [68].\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Omani law does not recognise the existence of companies not registered in Oman, or the contracts those companies enter into.114 Despite being subject to this registration requirement under Omani law, and despite being reminded by OMCO of that obligation, the Claimant did not register SFOH.115 On 22 August 2007, OMCO told the Claimant that the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement would be void if he failed to register SFOH in Oman by 30 November 2007.116 The Respondent contends that, as he did not do so, the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement was a nullity as of 30 November 2007, namely thirteen months before the US-Oman FTA took effect.117\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [270]-[273]; Oman's Rejoinder at [74]. To the extent that the Claimant contends that the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement did not require compliance with Omani law, the Respondent notes that, while this is denied, it does not matter in any event: the obligation to register is not created by contract, but rather by Omani law, and the lease agreement merely repeated that obligation (Oman's Rejoinder at [70]).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [274].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [275].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [275]. The Respondent notes that, subsequently on 2 June 2008, OMCO reconfirmed that the lease agreement had been rendered null and void (Oman's Counter-Memorial at [280]).\n\n100.\n\nAs to the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, the Respondent claims that this is not protected by the US-Oman FTA because OMCO had terminated that agreement before the FTA came into force.118 The Respondent submits that OMCO terminated the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement under cover of letter dated 20 July 2008, and that (although its reasons for doing so are not properly in issue before this Tribunal119) OMCO acted within the terms of the agreement in exercising its right to terminate.120 The Respondent refers to a history of correspondence between OMCO and the Claimant (commencing on 30 April 2008) in which OMCO sought reimbursement of the RO 10,000 fine that OMCO paid to MOCI owing to Emrock's unauthorised operations outside the Jebel Wasa; the Respondent submits that the Claimant's failure to make this payment (and other overdue payments under the agreement) entitled OMCO to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement pursuant to Article 10(iv) thereof.121 Again, as this termination was effected on 20 July 2008, the Respondent contends that the Claimant had no \" *covered investment* \" as of the date the US-Oman FTA came into force on 1 January 2009.122\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [283]; Oman's Rejoinder at [76].\n\nThe Respondent notes that any complaint as to the grounds for OMCO terminating the agreement (and further, OMCO's right to terminate the agreement) could only properly be considered in an arbitration commenced under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, not under the US-Oman FTA (Oman's Rejoinder at [65]-[66] and [85]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [10] and [20]).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [284]-[285]; Oman's Rejoinder at [91]-[94].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [76]-[79], [88] and [93].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [283]; Oman's Rejoinder at [76] and [79].\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the purported termination by OMCO on 20 July 2008 was valid under Omani law.123 The Respondent submits that, contrary to the Claimant's position, Omani law did not require OMCO to obtain a judicial decree from an Omani court authorising the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement in order to validly terminate that agreement.124 In this respect, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's reliance upon RD 6/89 is misplaced, as that law governs only \" *residential unit[s] or commercial or industrial or professional shops and its leased extensions* \".125\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [287]-[288]. The Respondent also notes that international law does not diminish OMCO's right to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, and in such respect argues that the doctrine of proportionality invoked by the Claimant has no application here (Oman's Rejoinder at [100]-[101]).\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [95]. In this respect, the Respondent notes that this makes common sense: if every party seeking to terminate a lease were required first to obtain a court judgment to do so, the Omani courts would be inundated with claims to that end (Oman's Rejoinder at [99]).\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [95].\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's submission that OMCO rescinded its July 2008 termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.126 The Respondent contends that there is no evidence that OMCO's Board of Directors ever acted to vacate the July 2008 termination or to reinstate the Agreement.127 According to the Respondent, the fact that OMCO did not take immediate steps following termination to evict the Claimant from the site of the project does not mean that the Agreement was not effectively terminated on 20 July 2008.128 In this same connection, the Respondent contends that OMCO's further February 2009 termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement does not mean that OMCO had reinstated that agreement after 20 July 2008;129 rather, the Respondent explains that this reaffirmation of the decision to terminate was compelled by the Claimant's refusal to acknowledge the end of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.130\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [291]-[299].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [291]; Oman's Rejoinder at [80]-[84]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [18].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [294].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [297]; Oman's Rejoinder at [80].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [80].\n\n103.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the reaffirmation of the decision was only delayed until after 1 January 2009 (ie after the US-Oman FTA came into force) because of a change in leadership in OMCO: Dr Al Azri, the Chairman of OMCO, stepped down from that position in late 2008, and the OMCO Board of Directors decided to defer issuing the notice to the Claimant until after H E Al Dheeb was installed as the new Chairman in early 2009.131\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [81]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [18].\n\n**(ii) Claimant's position**\n----------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it had valid leases on the date the US-Oman FTA came into force and thereafter, and notes that the leases are captured by the definition of \" *investment*\u00a0\" in Article 10.27 of the US-Oman FTA.132 The Claimant notes that the Ibri Court of Appeal found on 6 June 2010 that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was in force and not validly terminated,133 and that although that court's judgment did not address the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement, such agreement was also never validly terminated.134\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [149] (referring specifically to Art 10.27(h) of the US-Oman FTA); Claimant's Reply at [87]-[122].\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Ibri Court of Appeal made no such finding, and that the court had not been asked to consider (and did not consider) the issues surrounding OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement (Oman's Rejoinder at [19], [32] and [34]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [24]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [16] and [88]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Introduction and Answer A.20.\n\n105.\n\nAddressing the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, the Claimant contends that the lease was in force on 1 January 2009. The Claimant submits that OMCO's purported termination letter of 20 July 2008 had no effect, and that the second attempted termination in February 2009 demonstrates its understanding that the earlier letter was ineffective.135 The Claimant submits that the second letter was also ineffective in this respect.136\n\nClaimant's Reply at [89]-[110].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [110].\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant raises a number of arguments as to why the 20 July 2008 letter was ineffective in purporting to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. First, the Claimant alleges that the purported termination of a multimillion dollar agreement for the alleged non-reimbursement of a comparatively small fines totalling only RO 10,000 (about US$26,000) was an evident pretext (rather than a legitimate reason) for terminating the lease.137 The Claimant notes that Emrock had not failed to pay any legitimate amounts due to OMCO, and that (as found by the Ibri Court of Appeal) OMCO had obtained the proper permits for Emrock, and Emrock was operating the quarry within the concession area.138 To the extent that proper permits had not been obtained, this was a breach of OMCO's own obligations under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, for which OMCO could not seek an indemnity from Emrock.139\n\nClaimant's Reply at [89].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [90].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [90]-[91]. In this respect, the Claimant observes that the fines were assessed by MOCI against OMCO, not Emrock (Claimant's Reply at [92]).\n\n107.\n\nSecond, the Claimant contends that OMCO's purported termination did not comply with the provisions of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.140 The purported termination was made under Article 10(iv) of the lease, which relevantly states that the lessor has a right of termination if the tenant is \" *not complying with the term of payment under this agreement* \".141 According to the Claimant, that provision could not apply to the present case, as the alleged failure to reimburse OMCO for fines was not Emrock's responsibility under the lease agreement.142\n\nClaimant's Reply at [94]-[98].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [95].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [95]. To the extent that Emrock did have responsibility to pay those fines (which is denied by the Claimant), such responsibility would not be part of the \"terms of payment under this agreement\" but rather part of a separate obligation to indemnify (Claimant's Reply at [95]).\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant posits that OMCO's correspondence with Emrock demonstrates that OMCO understood that Article 10(iv) did not apply.143 OMCO, in its 22 June 2008 letter to Emrock, first relied upon the \" *substantial breach* \" provision in Article 10(iii) of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement (rather than Article 10(iv)); the \" *substantial breach* \" clause required OMCO to allow Emrock 60 days to remedy the alleged breach.144 However, the lease was purportedly terminated only 28 days later, in reliance (for the first time) upon Article 10(iv) of the lease as the grounds for termination, and without the required 60-day notice of Article 10(iii).145 As submitted by the Claimant, Article 10(iv) does not apply here, and the inconsistent grounds for termination articulated by OMCO further demonstrates that its stated reasons were a pretext.146\n\nClaimant's Reply at [96].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [96].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [96].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [97].\n\n109.\n\nThird, the Claimant observes that Omani law requires that a judicial decree be obtained before a lease agreement for real property may be terminated.147 The Claimant submits that, as OMCO did not use the proper legal channels to seek redress by applying for a termination, Oman cannot rely upon OMCO's meaningless declaration of termination.148 Even had a judicial decree been sought, the Claimant contends that it would not have been granted, as Emrock had not breached the lease, and even if it had (which is denied), Oman offers no reason to think that any reasonable Omani judge would have permitted OMCO to seize on non-payment of a few thousand dollars to terminate a lease worth hundreds of millions.149\n\nClaimant's Reply at [99]. To the extent that Oman contends that RD 5/81 applies to the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, the Claimant submits that this is incorrect, as that decree only addresses termination of usufructs of state-owned land (rather than leases of unimproved land, which is the case here). The Claimant submits that the issue of termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement is instead governed by general Omani principles of landlord-tenant law, under which court approval is required for termination (Claimant's Reply at [102]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [100].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [100].\n\n110.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that, even if non-reimbursement of a small amount of fines constituted grounds for termination under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, the termination of a lease worth hundreds of millions of dollars on that basis would violate basic requirements of proportionality.150 In this respect, the Claimant notes that Omani courts enforce principles of proportionality in considering applications to terminate a lease or other contract, and that proportionality is a principle of customary international law.151\n\nClaimant's Reply at [104].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [104].\n\n111.\n\nTurning to OMCO's second purported termination letter of 17 February 2009, the Claimant maintains that this letter was also ineffective to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.152 Further, by the fact of sending the second letter, the Claimant contends that OMCO demonstrated its understanding that the lease was still in effect at that time (namely, over a month after the US-Oman FTA came into force).153\n\nClaimant's Reply at [110].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [107].\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the second letter relevantly provides that OMCO \" *hereby terminate[s] EMROCK with immediate effect because EMROCK has not complied with making payments to* [OMCO].\"154 The Claimant submits that this language clearly reflects OMCO's understanding that the lease was still in place as of 17 February 2009 (the date of the second letter), as the lease could not be terminated \" *with immediate effect*\u00a0\" had it already been terminated in July 2008.155 Further, the Claimant contends that subsequent statements by OMCO also confirm OMCO's understanding that the lease agreement was not terminated until after the US-Oman FTA entered into force: in various communications made by OMCO in 2010, OMCO referred to the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement having been cancelled/terminated since March 2009.156\n\nClaimant's Reply at [108].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [108]. The Claimant also submits that, in any event, the OMCO Board of Director's specification of a 2009 effective date waives the effect (if any) of any earlier purported termination (Claimant's Reply at [108]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [109].\n\n113.\n\nAs to the effectiveness of the second purported termination, the Claimant submits that this is irrelevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, as this alleged termination (in February or March 2009) occurred after the US-Oman FTA came into force.157 In any event, the Claimant contends that the 17 February 2009 letter suffers from the same flaws as the 20 July 2008 letter, as it is a disproportionate sanction for a minor alleged non-payment of an amount that was actually OMCO's responsibility, it failed to comply with the lease, and it did not receive judicial approval.158\n\nClaimant's Reply at [110].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [110]\n\n114.\n\nWith respect to the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement, the Claimant maintains that such agreement was in force on 1 January 2009 and that (contrary to the Respondent's submission) SFOH was not under an obligation (under either Omani law or the lease agreement itself) to register in Oman.159 The Claimant notes that the Respondent has not cited any provision of the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement to support the proposition that the agreement required registration by SFOH.160 The Claimant also submits that the Omani laws requiring registration of foreign entities do not apply to SFOH, as SFOH carried out no mining or other relevant business operations in Oman itself; rather, it acted only through Emrock pursuant to the Agreement for Production of Limestone and Crushing Project dated 15 January 2007.161\n\nClaimant's Reply at [112]-[115].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [112]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [45].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [114].\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that, even had registration been required, SFOH's failure to register would not have resulted in the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement being automatically null and void.162 It is the Claimant's contention that, under applicable Omani law, the penalty for failure to register a company doing business in Oman is a small monetary fine.163 The Claimant submits that nothing in that law declares contracts void as a consequence of non-registration.164 Further, to the extent that the Respondent argues that Omani law does not recognise the existence of companies not registered in Oman, the Claimant submits that this is inconsistent with the imposition of fines on those companies by Oman for non-registration: ie if such companies were treated as non-existent, Oman could not fine them.165\n\nClaimant's Reply at [116].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [116]-[117].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [117]. The Claimant submits that OMCO had conceded that the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement was not automatically void from its inception, as OMCO had threatened that it would treat the agreement as void if SFOH had not registered by 30 November 2007 (Claimant's Reply at [119]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [118].\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimant also notes that OMCO never attempted to terminate the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement on the basis of SFOH's alleged failure to register.166 Instead, OMCO only stated in its 22 August 2007 letter that the lease would be treated as \" *null and void*\u00a0\" if SFOH did not register by 30 November 2007; it never issued a notice of substantial breach under that lease and a 60-day opportunity to cure.167 Even if the 22 August 2007 could be construed as a notice of substantial breach, the Claimant observes that no actual notice of termination was subsequently issued (as required under the lease) and no judicial decree of termination was obtained (as required under Omani law).168\n\nClaimant's Reply at [120].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [120].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [120].\n\n117.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that OMCO acquiesced in SFOH's non-registration, as it never replied to the Claimant's letter of 4 July 2008 which explained why OMCO was incorrect in believing that SFOH was required to register.169 As OMCO did not object or respond to that letter, the Claimant argues that is evident that OMCO was satisfied with Mr Al Tamimi's response, or at least gave him ground to believe that it was.170\n\nClaimant's Reply at [121].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [121].\n\n**B. MERITS**\n-------------\n\n**(a) Overview**\n----------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the question of Oman's liability cannot be disputed, as the Respondent is bound by the decision of its own appellate court, which is a part of the Omani state.171 That court judgment, according to the Claimant, relevantly held that the Claimant was operating within the boundaries allotted to him by a valid and existing lease, and that he had not committed the environmental violations of which he was accused.172 It so follows that Oman had no justification for its coercion (through its environmental authorities and police) of Mr Al Tamimi to undertake to stop operating the quarry as a condition for being released from jail pending trial.173\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [2].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [2].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [2].\n\n119.\n\nEven if the appellate court's decision were to be disregarded, the Claimant maintains that the facts indisputably establish that the court's conclusions were correct.174 In this respect, the Claimant notes that Oman had provided Mr Al Tamimi with multiple conflicting coordinates of where he was allowed to mine, and also notes that the environmental citations issued to the Claimant's quarry had little (if any) basis in fact.175\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [3].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [3].\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimant presents three questions of liability under the US-Oman FTA for determination by this Tribunal, namely: expropriation, denial of fair and equitable treatment, and denial of national treatment.176 As compensation for these breaches, the Claimant claims damages in the amount of US$273 million plus interest, attorneys' fees and other costs of the arbitration.177\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [4].\n\nThe Claimant's pleas for relief are set out in full above at [38]-[41].\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimant's arguments with respect to liability and submits that the Claimant has not presented any evidence discharging his obligation to prove that Oman breached the US-Oman FTA.178 The Respondent submits that the Claimant seeks to transform a conventional breach-of-contract case against OMCO (whose acts are not attributable to Oman) into a treaty claim based on actions allegedly taken by Oman.179\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [9].\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [2].\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant has no treaty claim with respect to the actions of OMCO, as that entity did not exercise any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority on the part of Oman.180 As such, OMCO's termination of the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement and the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement cannot be attributed to Oman181 (in any event, and as discussed above, the Respondent maintains that OMCO terminated these agreements, and hence any investment the Claimant might have had, before the US-Oman FTA took effect182). If the Claimant had wished to challenge OMCO's actions with respect to the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, the Respondent submits that the proper remedy was in accordance with the arbitration provisions of that agreement, not under the US-Oman FTA.183\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [6].\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [6].\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [5].\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [10].\n\n123.\n\nTo the extent that the Claimant complains of actions attributable to Oman, the Respondent submits that those actions were not in breach of the US-Oman FTA. According to the Respondent, Mr Al Tamimi's arrest by the Royal Oman Police was inconsequential, as it occurred long after he had lost his investment and any right to occupy the quarry site.184 Further, the Respondent contends that the Claimant had been trespassing on the quarry site and operating in violation of Omani environmental regulations by excavating sand and gravel material from areas outside the Jebel Wasa (the Respondent notes that his authorisations only covered the quarrying of hard limestone rock in the Jebel Wasa), and that such actions led to his arrest.185 The Respondent submits that the Claimant had been repeatedly told to stop his activities and that the Claimant knew he never had authorisation to excavate *wadi* material from outside the Jebel Wasa.186\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton, at [3].\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [2], [8], [12] and [29].\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [8], [22] and [29].\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Ibri Court of Appeal judgment cannot sustain the Claimant's treaty claims.187 The Respondent submits that the Claimant mischaracterises the court's findings, and that in any event, his US-Oman FTA claims are not tied to whether he was guilty of the criminal charges he faced following his 23 May 2009 arrest.188\n\nOman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [8].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [16].\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant's claims should be dismissed in their entirety with costs.189\n\nThe Respondent's pleas for relief are set out in full above at [42]-[44] above.\n\n**(b) The Ibri Court of Appeal judgment**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Claimant's position**\n---------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Omani Court of Appeal's judgment forms a central pillar of the Claimant's case on liability.190 The Claimant submits that the court relevantly found that the Claimant was operating lawfully when Oman shut down his quarry: first, he was operating within the approved concession area for mining (namely, the 14.7 km\u00b2 area identified in the Housing Ministry's *krooki*191), and second, OMCO had received all of the required environmental approvals in order for the Claimant to operate his crushers and quarry.192\n\nThe judgment is also relevant to the Claimant's position on jurisdiction, as the Claimant submits that the court found that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was in effect on the date of Oman's alleged US-Oman FTA violations in May 2009 (see above at [105]-[113]).\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Introduction and Answer A.20.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [12]-[13] and [17]-[19];

To the extent that the Claimant relies upon Art 280 of Oman's Penal Procedure Law (promulgated in SD No 97/99) as authority for the application of *res judicata* and collateral estoppel principles under Omani law, the Respondent submits that this article is irrelevant. Article 280, according to the Respondent, provides that the *res judicata* effect of a criminal judgment concerns only \" *the occurrence of the crime, its legal description, and its connection to its perpetrator* \", which simply means that in a subsequent civil or criminal case no party could rightfully claim that Mr Al Tamimi had committed the offences of which he had been acquitted by the Ibri Court of Appeal. The Respondent contends that there is no sensible connection between Art 280 and the Claimant's submission that a criminal acquittal precludes the parties from re-litigating the same factual issues in a civil case, even if the underlying claim is different. Put another way, the Respondent submits that, under Omani law, the principle of *res judicata* does not apply as the Claimant contends, and the principle of collateral estoppel does not apply at all (Oman's Rejoinder at [37]-[40]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [24]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20).\n\n134.\n\nAs to the findings of the Ibri Court of Appeal as characterised by the Claimant, the Respondent submits that the court did not find that (a) Mr Al Tamimi or Emrock had the requisite environmental permits to operate outside the area in the Jebel Wasa leased from OMCO, or (b) Mr Al Tamimi had previously been operating only within permitted areas.212\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [20]-[21], [28], [33]-[36]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20.\n\n135.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that Mr Al Tamimi had not asked the Ibri Court of Appeal to decide the question of whether he or Emrock had the requisite environmental permits.213 Rather, his defence to the second count against him (namely, concerning violation of environmental regulations) was that he could not be justly accused of failing to obtain the requisite licences and approvals when it was OMCO that was required to obtain them under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.214 The court acquitted Mr Al Tamimi of this count, and in doing so simply noted the approvals initially obtained by OMCO; the Respondent submits that the court did not, as the Claimant contends, find that OMCO had received all of the environmental approvals required in order for the Claimant to operate his crushers and quarry (in particular, those approvals required in order to excavate *wadi* materials from locations outside the Jebel Wasa).215\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [20], [33], and [36]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [24]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20.\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [20] and [33].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [20], [33], and [36]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20.\n\n136.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the Ibri Court of Appeal did not find that all of Mr Al Tamimi's operations were within the OMCO concession area, and that such issue was not presented to the court.216 The Respondent contends that the Claimant mischaracterises the evidence of Mr Abdul Rahman, the Ministry of Housing, Electricity and Water surveyor who attended the site and gave evidence before the Ibri Court of Appeal.217 On the Respondent's case, and also on Mr Abdul Rahman's own evidence in this arbitration, Mr Abdul Rahman inspected the site on only one occasion for the purpose of marking the boundary points of the concession granted to OMCO, not for determining where the Claimant was conducting mining or excavation activities.218\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [21] and [35]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [24]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20.\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [351]; Oman's Rejoinder at [21], [35] and [57]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [24]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20.\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [21], [35] and [57]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [24]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.20; Witness Statement of Mahmoun Al-Zubair Abdul Rahman at [2]-[6].\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the 25 April 2010 judgment of the Mahda Court of First Instance is relevant to this proceeding.219 In its judgment, the Mahda Court of First Instance convicted Mr Al Tamimi of four environmental charges, including the claim that Mr Al Tamimi was excavating *wadi* material beyond the western boundaries of the Jebel Wasa without authorisation.220 Relevantly, the Respondent claims that, while the judgment is not dispositive of the Claimant's treaty claims, it does reveal Mr Al Tamimi's unauthorised operations outside the Jebel Wasa.221\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [41]-[44].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [231]-[232]; Oman's Rejoinder at [41].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [43].\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, despite the Claimant's contention otherwise, the Ibri Court of Appeal did not resolve substantially the same issues as the Mahda Court.222 For the Respondent, the Ibri Court of Appeal judgment could not and did not absolve the Claimant of the environmental violations for which he was charged and for which the Mahda Court of First Instance imposed penalties.223 The Respondent relevantly argues that the charges in the Ibri Court of Appeal proceedings resulted from the Claimant's 23 May 2009 arrest, whereas the claims leading to the Mahda Court judgment were based on earlier site inspections by MECA officials.224\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [389]; Oman's Rejoinder at [44].\n\nOman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.21.\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [44]. See also Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer C.21.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent also observes that the Claimant never contested the decision of the Mahda Court of First Instance, and that it is groundless for Mr Al Tamimi still to claim that he was not aware of the proceedings at that time.225 In the latter respect, the Respondent notes that, before a decision had been rendered by the Mahda Court, Mr Al Tamimi had asked the Public Prosecution Authority in Muscat to intervene to stop the Public Prosecutor in the Al Buraimi Government from continuing with the charges against him.226\n\nOman Counter Memorial at [232]; Oman's Rejoinder at [44].\n\nOman Counter Memorial at [242]-[248]; Oman's Rejoinder at [44].\n\n**(c) Emrock's operations**\n---------------------------\n\n**(i) Claimant's position**\n---------------------------\n\n140.\n\nNotwithstanding the binding effect of the Ibri Court of Appeal judgment, the Claimant submits that the facts prove that Emrock was operating inside the OMCO concession area and with the proper permits.227\n\nClaimant's Reply at [41]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Introduction.\n\n141.\n\nFirst, the Claimant submits that, under the two Lease Agreements, Emrock's and SFOH's activities were not confined to any particular area within the concession area.228 On the Claimant's case, Oman's allegation that Mr Al Tamimi was operating outside the concession area or in the *Wadi Sumayni* ignores the geography of the site.229 In this respect, the Claimant refers to Oman's allegation that the Claimant had unlawfully extracted materials in the *Wadi Sumayni*.230\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [15].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [41]-[62].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [42].\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant notes that Emrock's operations were fully within OMCO's concession area, and that the *Wadi Sumayni* is far outside it.231 In this regard, the Claimant submits that he was entitled to quarry up to 6 km\u00b2 anywhere within OMCO's concession area, which was the entire 14.7 km\u00b2 described by the Omani Housing Ministry's *krooki*.232 The Claimant notes that a flat plain with deposits of sand and gravel, known as the *Sayh Sumayni*, lies between the Jebel Wasa mountain (the limestone deposit that was at the core of the Claimant's operations) and the *Wadi Sumayni* ; OMCO's concession area boundary runs through that sand and gravel plain, so that the plain lies partly within and partly outside the concession site.233 The Claimant does not dispute that Emrock excavated sand and gravel from the *Sayh Sumayni* beside the mountain, which was within its concession area,234 but contests that any such materials were excavated from the *Wadi Sumayni*.235\n\nClaimant's Reply at [44].\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Introduction, Answers A.2-A.4, A.6, A.9 and A.11.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [45].\n\nThe Claimant contends that this use of sand and gravel from a quarry site is common and expected in limestone quarrying operations, and also that such use was anticipated in OMCO's environmental permit application (Claimant's Reply at [51]). The Claimant submits that he was authorised to excavate sand and gravel pursuant to the Lease Agreements and the Environmental Impact Assessment (Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer A.15).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [51]. In this way, the Claimant argues that Oman confuses the mining of so called \"w *adi materials* \" (which, in the quarrying and construction industries in the Middle East, is commonly used to refer to natural sand and gravel eroded from a mountain, which may or may not have literally been excavated from a *wadi*, that is, a dry watercourse) with mining \" *in the Wadi* [Sumayni]\" (Claimant's Reply at [50]).\n\n143.\n\nTo the extent that the Respondent alleges that the Claimant was operating a \" *crusher in the Wadi* [Sumayni] *to excavate sand and gravel from the Wadi* \", the Claimant submits that this defies common sense.236 The Claimant asks why he would have travelled several kilometres to the *Wadi Sumayni* to obtain sand and gravel which was already available within the concession area in the *Sayh Sumayni*.237 Further, the Claimant notes that he did not possess an \" *alluvial crusher* \", which he is alleged by Oman to have used in the *Wadi Sumayni*.238\n\nClaimant's Reply at [59].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [59].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [61].\n\n144.\n\nSecond, the Claimant claims that, notwithstanding Oman's allegation otherwise, the Claimant was not required to obtain any additional environmental permits.239 The Claimant submits that it was OMCO, not the Claimant, which was responsible for obtaining all the required permits (both under the Lease Agreements and under Omani law),240 and in this respect, OMCO had confirmed to the Claimant on 22 August 2007 that OMCO had fulfilled its obligations under the Lease Agreements by obtaining all necessary permits.241\n\nClaimant's Reply at [63]-[79].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [64]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answers A.5 and A.17.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [65]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answers A.5 and A.17.\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, as a matter of fact, OMCO's representation was accurate as OMCO had obtained all of the permits required for the project to proceed.242 To the extent that Oman alleges that OMCO required a separate permit for crushers, the Claimant notes that OMCO's applications specifically stated in numerous places that the quarry would use \" *crushers* \" to process excavated limestone,243 and that the temporary permit subsequently granted by MECA did not exclude the use of crushers or say anything about a separate permit for crushers being required.244 In any event, if a permit for a crusher was required, the Claimant contends that the burden is on Oman to explain why its state-owned mining company did not apply for that permit (as the leases and Omani law required), and why the permit would not have been granted if OMCO had applied for it at that time.245\n\nClaimant's Reply at [66].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [66]-[67]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answers A.5, A.9 and A.15.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [68]-[69]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [29]. The Claimant also notes that OMCO's 3 November 2006 application to MECA anticipated Emrock's crushers being located in the *Sayh Sumayni* and also the impact of the crushers' operation upon that plain and other minor *wadis* and streams. The Ministry did not indicate that its approval of the project in any way carved out operations impacting *wadi* plains or sand and gravel at the site, or the operation of crushers in those areas (Claimant's Reply at [74]-[77]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [73].\n\n146.\n\nThird and finally, the Claimant submits that Oman's allegation that he was operating outside the approved area for mining is contrary to the facts.246 To the extent that RPM, Oman's expert, argues that the Claimant's quarrying operations were beyond the boundary described by the coordinates in MECA's initial environmental approval (even if within the OMCO concession boundaries), the Claimant notes that this mining boundary was different from the boundary identified in OMCO's application.247 The Claimant alleges that the mining boundary in the approval, although roughly the same size as that identified in OMCO's application, was square and had been moved slightly to the southeast.248\n\nClaimant's Reply at [80]-[86].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [80].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [80].\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimant submits that neither Oman nor RPM has identified any reason as to why MECA shifted the boundary without giving any explanation.249 Also, the Claimant suggests that there is nothing on the record to suggest that MECA ever discussed the boundary shift with the applicant (OMCO), and that neither OMCO nor MECA ever discussed the reason for the shift with the Claimant.250 The Claimant submits that the most obvious explanation for the change is that the new coordinates were an error in description in the licence, or that the boundary was only intended to be a rough approximation of the general area of quarrying.251\n\nClaimant's Reply at [80].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [81].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [81].\n\n148.\n\nTo the extent that RPM's report alleges that the Claimant's limestone drilling and blasting extended beyond the approved mining area, but still within the OMCO concession area, the Claimant notes that this allegation was rejected by the Ibri Court of Appeal.252 In any event, even had he extended beyond that area, the Claimant notes that he can hardly be faulted for not knowing precisely where he was supposed to mine, given that Oman itself could not determine what the proper coordinates were.253\n\nClaimant's Reply at [85].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [85]. The Claimant also notes that Oman offers no reason why that deviation (if it had in fact occurred) would have been significant from an environmental perspective (Claimant's Reply at [85]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer A.19).\n\n**(ii) Respondent's position**\n------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, as a matter of fact, the Claimant was operating outside the approved area and without the requisite permits.254 The Respondent notes that, in the Claimant's submissions, Mr Al Tamimi elides the distinction between the concession area awarded to OMCO (consisting of around 14.7 km\u00b2) and the smaller area within that concession leased to Emrock for hard-rock mining.255 The Lease Agreements did not afford him the right to excavate *wadi* material throughout the entire concession area, and further, he had not obtained approval from the Omani authorities to do so.256\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [9]-[13] and [45]-[64].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [12] and [45].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [9]-[12] and [46]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer B.15a. The Respondent contends that the initial Environmental Impact Assessment submitted for approval to the Ministry of Regional Municipalities, Environment and Water Resources (the predecessor of MECA) sought approval only to mine hard rock in a 4 km2 area of the Jebel Wasa leased from OMCO, and did not seek approval to excavate *wadi* material from outside the Jebel Wasa (Oman's Rejoinder at [10] and [12]-[13]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [13]; Responses to PostHearing Questions, Answer B.9; Second Van der Wiele Witness Statement at [3]-[10]).\n\n150.\n\nFor the Respondent, the distinction drawn by the Claimant between the *Sayh Sumayni* and the *Wadi Sumayni* is irrelevant, as the Claimant was not permitted to excavate *wadi* materials (ie sand, gravel and boulders) from either area: the Claimant was only permitted to drill, blast, and extract hard rock from within the 4 km\u00b2 area of the Jebel Wasa leased from OMCO for that purpose.257 The Respondent also contends that Mr Al Tamimi did not at the time draw the distinction between the *Sayh Sumayni* and the *Wadi Sumayni* that he draws today.258 Rather, Mr Al Tamimi was aware that the relevant distinction was between hard rock mining in the 4 km\u00b2 area of the Jebel Wasa, and his unauthorised operations to excavate *wadi* material from outside that area.259\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [9]-[13], [45] and [47]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [12]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answers B.2, B.3 and B.15a.

The Respondent also refers to a memo dated 1 May 2008 from the Claimant to Mr Gupta, Emrock's operations manager. The subject of the memo was \" *STOP WADI OPERATION* \", and relevantly provided that Emrock had to remove all equipment *\"from the wadi area\"* within 48 hours (Oman's Rejoinder at [52]-[53]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [16]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer B.18c; Memorandum from Mr Al Tamimi to Mr Gupta, dated 1 May 2008 (**Exhibit J-177**)).\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [49]-[55].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [50], [52] and [55]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [16]; Oman's Post-Hearing Answers, Answers B.13 and B.18c.\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the alleged difference between the concession boundaries plotted in OMCO's application and in MECA's initial environmental approval is without significance.264 First, moving the coordinates was within that Ministry's discretion, and second, the exact location of the 4 km\u00b2 quarrying area was not the source of the Ministry's censure: it was the Claimant's operations outside the Jebel Wasa.265\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [62].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [62].

To the extent that the Claimant contends that unrelated third parties were responsible for the excavations plotted by OMCO outside the OMCO concession area (Claimant's Reply at [53]), the Respondent submits that this is incorrect as the map identified areas excavated by the Claimant while the project was in progress (Oman's Rejoinder at [56]; Second Al Waily Witness Statement at [15]).\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [57], fn 100. The Respondent also notes that the Claimant's distinction between the types of equipment he situated outside the Jebel Wasa is irrelevant, as he had no right to operate any equipment, regardless of its type, outside the Jebel Wasa (Oman's Rejoinder at [59]).\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that, notwithstanding the Claimant's submission otherwise, the Claimant was operating without the requisite permits.269 The Claimant's authorisations were limited to the quarry project in the Jebel Wasa, and as the Claimant knew at the time, in February and April 2008, he was not authorised to excavate *wadi* material at any location falling within the OMCO concession area.270 The Respondent notes that OMCO's obligations under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement were limited to the hard-rock mining project in the Jebel Wasa: under that lease, OMCO was not required to seek authorisation on the Claimant's behalf from MOCI to excavate *wadi* material outside the Jebel Wasa, although it did so in February 2008.271 As noted above, the Ministry did not grant that authorisation.272\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [60]-[64].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [61].

First, it contends that, regardless of OMCO's status, MECA's actions precipitated the purported lease termination.275 Second, it submits that OMCO is in fact an organ of the Omani State.276\n\nClaimant's Reply at [207]-[212].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [213]-[218]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer A.17.\n\n157.\n\nAs to its first submission, the Claimant alleges that Oman intervened to use its influence or sovereign power for its own purposes to force OMCO to use OMCO's contractual right as a pretext for terminating the underlying agreement.277 The Claimant submits that OMCO's purported lease termination was motivated by governmental pressure, and that in such respect the purported termination for non-payment of minimal fines was nothing more than a pretext.278\n\nClaimant's Reply at [207].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [208].\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the evidence shows that MECA had been putting pressure on OMCO to force Emrock and SFOH out of business (and out of Oman), including by bringing criminal charges against OMCO and Mr Al Waily.279 According to the Claimant, the termination notice sent to Emrock in 2009 was largely motivated by a desire to placate MECA in the hope of ending Mr Al Waily's prosecution.280 To that end, the Claimant refers to a 3 May 2009 letter from OMCO's attorneys, Trowers & Hamlins, to Mr Al Muharrami of MECA.281 That letter, according to the Claimant, reveals the strategy of OMCO's lawyers: namely, to cast blame on Emrock, assure Mr Al Muharrami that they were cooperating with him in stopping Emrock's operations, and to ask Mr Al Muharrami to withdraw the prosecution of Mr Al Waily on that basis.282 For the Claimant, the letter makes clear that the purported termination of the lease took place under coercive conditions created by Mr Al Muharrami of MECA.283\n\nClaimant's Reply at [209].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [210].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [210]; Letter from Trowers & Hamlins to Mr Al Muharrami, dated 3 May 2009 (**Exhibit J-285**).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [210].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [211].\n\n159.\n\nAs to its second argument, the Claimant alleges that OMCO operates at all times as an arm of the Omani State.284 In so doing, the Claimant contends that OMCO exercises governmental authority under Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA, and that in any event, responsibility for OMCO is attributable to Oman under principles of customary international law.285\n\nClaimant's Reply at [215]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer A.17. The Claimant notes that the Ibri Court of Appeal recognised that OMCO is a \" *government company that is subject to the oversight of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry* \" (Claimant's Reply at [213], quoting **Exhibit J-354** at 3).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [215].\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimant relevantly notes that the Omani Ministry of Oil and Gas is the 99% shareholder of OMCO, and that, pursuant to OMCO's bylaws, OMCO's board members act at all times as representatives of the shareholders.286 The Claimant also submits that OMCO's mining activities are closely controlled by MOCI, and in that respect observes that the managers and board members of OMCO are usually directors and ex-employees of MOCI.287 For that reason, according to the Claimant, MOCI exercises effective control over the activities and decisionmaking process of OMCO and its business.288\n\nClaimant's Reply at [215].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [216].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [217]. In this respect, the Claimant relevantly notes Oman's admission that OMCO's Board of Directors \" *reconsidered* \" Mr Al Waily's purported termination of Emrock's lease at the direction of the Commerce Ministry (Claimant's Reply at [217], quoting Oman's Counter-Memorial at [159] and [161]-[165]).\n\n(ii) **Respondent's position**\n------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that the question of attribution constitutes a fatal flaw in the Claimant's case.289 Specifically, the Respondent submits that the relevant actions allegedly causing the Claimant's losses, namely the termination of the Lease Agreements, were undertaken by OMCO, whose actions are not attributable to Oman under the US-Oman FTA.290\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [104].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [104].\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the State Parties to the US-Oman FTA purposefully narrowed the grounds for attribution of state responsibility, as the wording of the FTA only tracked one ground for attribution under the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility.291 In so doing, the Respondent submits that the US and Oman intentionally limited the circumstances that might result in Host State responsibility to those situations in which: (a) the State delegated governmental authority to a state enterprise, and (b) the enterprise exercised the governmental authority delegated to it.292 The Respondent submits that such a situation does not exist here.293\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [301]-[302]; Oman's Rejoinder at [105]-[106].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [303]; Oman's Rejoinder at [106].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [305]; Oman's Rejoinder at [105] and [107]-[109]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [6].\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there is no evidence that Oman delegated to OMCO any governmental authority, much less in connection with the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.294 In this respect, the Respondent notes that OMCO could not even issue licences, permits, or approvals for the Claimant's projects, as that authority resided with the Omani ministries.295 The Respondent also submits that there is no evidence that OMCO in fact exercised any governmental authority.296\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [306]-[311]; Oman's Rejoinder at [107]. To the extent that the Claimant refers to OMCO's ownership structure and Board of Directors, the Respondent submits that OMCO's shareholding and leadership, without more, prove nothing (Oman's Counter-Memorial at [304] and [311]; Oman's Rejoinder at [108]). The Respondent also contends that the Claimant's reference to the Ibri Court of Appeal judgment does not assist his case, as that court had not been asked to decide, and did not consider, whether OMCO had been delegated governmental authority under Omani law and then exercised that authority (Oman's Counter-Memorial at [312]).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [309]; Oman's Rejoinder at [107].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [315]-[318]; Oman's Rejoinder at [109].\n\n164.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant alleges that MOCI exerted \"effective control\" over OMCO, the Respondent submits that this test for attribution does not apply under the FTA and that, in any event, the test is not made out.297 In the latter regard, the Respondent contends that the evidence proves that MOCI did not control OMCO.298\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [110]-[111].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [112].\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Mr Al Tamimi's characterisation of the facts is not supported by the record.299 To the extent that the Claimant alleges that MECA was putting pressure on OMCO to force Emrock and SFOH out of business and out of Oman, the Respondent relevantly notes that the Claimant does not refer to any document from MECA to OMCO suggesting that OMCO should terminate the Lease Agreements.300 Further, the evidence to which the Claimant does refer (namely, various citations issued by MECA) demonstrates that there is no correlation between those citations and OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.301 In this respect, the Respondent notes that the citation letters (except for one) were all sent by MECA after (a) OMCO delivered its 20 July 2008 notice terminating the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, and (b) the 30 November 2007 date on which OMCO told the Claimant the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement was void.302\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [113]-[116].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [113].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [113].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [113].\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant's characterisation of the 3 May 2009 letter from OMCO's attorneys to Mr Al Muharrami suffers from a similar defect.303 The letter refers to a 15 April 2009 conversation between OMCO and MECA officials, which took place months after OMCO's Board had approved its actions with respect to Emrock, including the further 17 February 2009 termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.304\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [114].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [114]. For the same reason, The Respondent contends that there is no connection between the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement and the prosecution of Mr Al Waily, as the three claims filed against OMCO, and the basis of the prosecution of Mr Al Waily, were filed in March 2009, namely after OMCO had further terminated the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement (Oman's Rejoinder at [115]).\n\n**(e) Expropriation**\n---------------------\n\n**(i) Claimant's position**\n---------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Oman's actions constitute a breach of Article 10.6 of the US-Oman FTA.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimant notes that expropriation includes not only open and deliberate transfers of property but also \" *covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner in whole or in significant part of the use or reasonably to be expected benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the Host State* \".305 The Claimant contends that Oman's actions through its police (according to the Claimant, the Omani police stopped mining operations at the quarry and subjected Emrock's workers at the site to harassment, threats of arrest, and other measures that had the effect of forcing them to leave the site permanently) are a clear case of expropriation.306\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [48], quoting the tribunal in *AIG Capital Partners Inc and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/6), Award, 7 October 2003, at [10.3.1].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton, at [48].\n\n169.\n\nThe Claimant submits that he did not voluntarily abandon his investment, as contended by the Respondent, but rather was effectively ejected from the quarry site by the Omani police.307 The Claimant notes that, on 23 May 2009, Omani police and MECA representatives attended at the Claimant's site, ordered him to stop quarrying operations, and arrested him.308 In order to secure his release from jail, the Claimant claims that he was coerced by Omani police to make an undertaking that he would stop operating both of his crushers and screen; the effect of which was to require the Claimant to shut down limestone production, as without this equipment he could not produce limestone for sale.309 The Claimant submits that the Respondent expropriated his investment by forcing him to sign that undertaking which gave up his contractual rights in return for his release from jail.310\n\nClaimant's Reply at [142]-[149].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [143]. To the extent that Oman contends that the Claimant was arrested for unlawfully operating a crusher in the *Wadi Sumayni*, the Claimant again refutes this (Claimant's Reply at [143] and [145]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [144]-[145]. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer B.6.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [5]. See also Claimant's Memorial at [179].\n\n170.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Omani police then enforced the closure of the entire quarry, not just operations at specific locations and not just operations of crushers and screens.311 Although Emrock ceased its production activities immediately following Mr Al Tamimi's arrest (as the restrictions imposed by police prevented any production), the police stopped Emrock from conducting any operations at all.312 The Claimant submits that the Omani police prevented Emrock employees from (*inter alia*) loading trucks, selling limestone, and even cooking food, and progressively forced Emrock's employees to leave the site entirely.313 The Claimant contends that, in light of these facts, it is incorrect for Oman to allege that Mr Al Tamimi voluntarily abandoned his investment.314\n\nClaimant's Reply at [146].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [146].

The Claimant notes that by the time the Ibri Court of Appeal rendered its ruling more than a year after his arrest and the forced shutdown of quarry operations, Emrock's workforce had been dispersed by police harassment and no one remained at the site to safeguard Emrock's property (Claimant's Reply at [153]). The police did not safeguard the site either, and equipment and infrastructure were vandalised and looted (Claimant's Reply at [155]; Second Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [116]-[117]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [150].\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimant also contests Oman's argument that its actions were a valid exercise of its right to enforce its environmental laws under the \" *police powers* \" doctrine (as incorporated in Annex 10- B of the US-Oman FTA).318 The Claimant notes that Annex 10-B relevantly provides that regulatory takings are shielded only when they are \" *non-discriminatory* \" and are \" *designed and applied* \" for \" *legitimate* \" public purposes.319 In this way, the Claimant submits that Oman's actions were not designed and applied for legitimate purposes and were discriminatory.320\n\nClaimant's Reply at [157]-[167]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [49].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [158].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [159]-[167]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [49].\n\n**(ii) Respondent's position**\n------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it did not expropriate Mr Al Tamimi's investment.321 To the extent that the Claimant complains of OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, the Respondent submits that OMCO's actions cannot be attributed to Oman (as discussed above) and that, even if they could, Mr Al Tamimi's expropriation claim sounds only in contract.322 The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not demonstrated that OMCO's allegedly wrongful termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement constitutes both a breach of contract and of the US-Oman FTA, and as such, the only available remedy against OMCO's actions was in accordance with the arbitration provisions of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.323 The Respondent notes that the Claimant did indeed retain lawyers in 2009 to claim against OMCO under those provisions, but the claim was subsequently abandoned.324\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [118]-[157].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [323]-[338]; Oman's Rejoinder at [118]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [28].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [338]; Oman's Rejoinder at [119] and [124]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [10]. The Claimant submits that this argument is baseless. According to the Claimant, the Omani government engaged in a series of actions, through the Environmental Ministry, the Royal Oman Police, and OMCO, which individually and collectively deprived the Claimant of his investment; the fact that one of the actions in that series (OMCO's purported termination) also happened to be a breach of contract does not absolve Oman of its independent obligations under the US-Oman FTA (Claimant's Reply at [202]-[203]). In any event, even when viewed in isolation, the Claimant maintains that OMCO's purported termination was in breach of both the contract and the US-Oman FTA (Claimant's Reply at [204]; Claimant's Memorial at [182] and [184]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Introduction).\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [124]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [10].\n\n174.\n\nOn the other hand, insofar as the Claimant complains of his arrest and its alleged aftermath, the Respondent submits that Mr Al Tamimi had no investment capable of being expropriated as of the date of his arrest (23 May 2009).325 As explained above, the Respondent submits that Mr Al Tamimi's investments in Oman were tied to the Lease Agreements, which ended long before 23 May 2009.326\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [339] and [342]; Oman's Rejoinder at [125]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [28].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [125].\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that Mr Al Tamimi's property rights were not impacted by his arrest or prosecution.327 The Respondent notes that Mr Al Tamimi's undertaking was tied to the pending charges against him, namely that he was operating outside the Jebel Wasa, and that such undertaking did not prevent him from conducting limestone quarrying activities in the Jebel Wasa (although the Respondent contends that he no longer had any right to do so under the Lease Agreements).328 Further, the Respondent argues that there is no credible evidence that anyone, including the Omani police, ever sought to enforce the undertaking in the manner contended by the Claimant.329\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [126]-[135].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [343]; Oman's Rejoinder at [127]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [28].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [128]. The Respondent also observes that nothing in the judicial proceeding prevented Mr Al Tamimi from returning to the quarry following his brief detention (Oman's Counter-Memorial at [340]; Oman's Rejoinder at [129]).\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimant's allegations with respect to the actions of Oman's police.330 The Respondent relevantly notes that the Claimant has not produced any contemporaneous evidence of an arrest or detention involving Emrock's staff, and that, rather than being forced from the site by the police, Emrock's employees were dismissed in stages by Emrock in 2009 and 2010.331\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [130]-[132]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [28].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [130]-[131].\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant cannot undercut Oman's reliance on the \" *police powers* \" doctrine.332 The Respondent argues that the application of existing environmental laws lies at the core of a State's police power, and that any application of those laws that leads to the loss of property constitutes a non-compensable regulatory action as opposed to a compensable taking.333\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [136]-[157].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [340] and [347]-[348]; Oman's Rejoinder at [13]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [28].\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent points to Annex 10-B of the US-Oman FTA as underscoring Oman's right to exercise police powers.334 The Respondent also refers to Article 10.10 of the US-Oman FTA, by which the State Parties were explicit that neither Party should be constrained from \" *enforcing any measure* [...] *it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environment concerns* \".335 Oman submits that, in accordance with the police power doctrine and contrary to the Claimant's allegations, the actions of its police and prosecutors were *bona fide* and taken for a legitimate purpose.336\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [349]; Oman's Rejoinder at [138].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [349]; Oman's Rejoinder at [138].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [350]-[352]; Oman's Rejoinder at [138]-[144].\n\n179.\n\nRelevantly, the Respondent notes that the number of violations issued throughout the history of the Claimant's project makes clear that the Claimant's arrest was undertaken for a legitimate purpose rather than on account of the alleged ill-motives of one person (Mr Al Muharrami).337 According to the Respondent, the legitimacy of the police actions is further confirmed by a number of independent findings, including those findings made against the Claimant by the Mahda Court of First Instance in its 8 November 2009 and 25 April 2010 decisions.338 Oman also submits that the exoneration of the Claimant before the Ibri Court of Appeal does not prove that the arrest or the decision to prosecute constituted improper regulatory actions.339\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [139]. To the extent that the Claimant alleges that Oman, specifically Mr Al Muharrami, knew that the Claimant was operating lawfully but falsely accused him of operating outside the OMCO concession (see Claimant's Reply at [161]), the Respondent submits that this claim is spurious and should be disregarded (Oman's Rejoinder at [151]-[153]).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [352]; Oman's Rejoinder at [141] and [143]. The Respondent also refers to the findings of independent experts that Emrock was operating outside the authorised areas (in particular, Dar El Handasah: the independent expert hired by the Mahda Court of First Instance, and RPM, experts appointed by the Respondent in this arbitration) (Oman's Counter-Memorial at [351]; Oman's Rejoinder at [142] and [144]).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [350].\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot rely upon the doctrine of *res judicata* to avoid the application of the \" *police powers* \" doctrine.340 In this respect, the Respondent relevantly observes that it is accepted that international tribunals do not apply *res judicata* to domestic judgments,341 and that the ruling of the Ibri Court of Appeal does not suggest that either the police or the Omani prosecution authorities were acting for an illegitimate purpose.342 Oman submits that the only issue before the court was the legality of the Claimant's actions under Omani law, not that of the police or prosecutor under international law standards.343\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [145]-[150].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [147]-[148].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [149]-[150].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [149].\n\n**(f) Minimum standard of treatment**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Claimant's position**\n---------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Oman has breached its obligation under the US-Oman FTA to provide the minimum standard of treatment to the Claimant's investment. The Claimant notes that Article 10.5 of the US-Oman FTA relevantly provides as follows:\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\n\n*2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investors. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights.344*\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [195]; Claimant's Reply at [169], quoting from *Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Sultanate of Oman on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area* (**CLA-009**).\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to the text of Appendix 10-A to the US-Oman FTA:345\n\n*The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 10.5 and Annex 10-B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.*\n\nClaimant's Reply at [169], quoting from **CLA-009**.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Oman's conduct violated the most basic notions of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.346 The Claimant notes that the Respondent, through its provision of conflicting coordinates, made it impossible for the Claimant to know where he was permitted to operate.347 The Claimant also submits that Oman never explained consistently what additional permits Mr Al Tamimi was required to have (and why).348 In this context, the Claimant characterises the Royal Oman Police's actions as extraordinary and in breach of Article 10.5: the police arrested him, forced him to sign an undertaking to stop operations at the quarry, then enforced that undertaking to shut down the quarrying operations entirely and force Emrock's remaining employees from the site.349\n\nClaimant's Reply at [179]-[190].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [181]-[182].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [184]-[186]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [51]. The Claimant relevantly notes that, even if there had been a defect in the Claimant's permits, it was not responsible for such defects: under Omani law, OMCO held that responsibility as the site owner (Claimant's Reply at [186]).\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [51]. The Claimant also submits that Oman violated the full protection and security standard by forcing Emrock off the quarry site and then allowing Emrock's equipment and buildings to be looted and destroyed (Claimant's Reply at [189]).\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant submits that throughout 2009 the Respondent arbitrarily and repeatedly harassed Mr Al Tamimi, asserting without any basis that Emrock was violating environmental regulations and the terms of its lease agreement by operating in the *Wadi Sumayni*.350 In this respect the Claimant contends that the Ibri Court of Appeal judgment demonstrated that Emrock was not violating the law,351 and in any event, the Claimant argues that Oman has not provided any legitimate basis on which it could genuinely believe that Emrock was violating the law.352 The Claimant submits that it follows that Oman was harassing the company arbitrarily and without reason.353\n\nClaimant's Reply at [180].

The Respondent also submits that the newspaper article cited by the Claimant does not assist his case, as it makes no distinctions based on nationality.

See also Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [60].\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Oman significantly overstates the significance of the Nakheel contract, as Nakheel was not Emrock's only customer: by June 2009, Emrock had made sales to at least 130 customers, including large volume sales to Maher Rahal.425 The Claimant also notes that Nakheel never cancelled its contract with Emrock, but rather only temporarily suspended it.426\n\nClaimant's Reply at [237].

The First Boyd Expert Report calculated the fair market value of those assets at US$252 million, but this figure was revised in the Second Expert Report in light of, primarily, updated market data and an updated mine plan (Claimant's Reply at [11] and [222]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [227] and [273]-[274]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [65].\n\n218.\n\nBoyd's valuation is based on projections through 1 September 2032, namely the date on which the Lease Agreements would have terminated after the initial term of ten years and three extensions of five years each.440 Boyd applies the discounted cash flow (\" **DCF** \") methodology in reaching its valuation, and uses the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\" **WACC** \") to calculate and apply a discount rate of 10 percent to the projected net after tax cash flows.441\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [259].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [259]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [77].\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Boyd's valuation remains in many ways conservative.442 Among other examples, the Claimant notes that Boyd relies upon pricing for armour rock and aggregate which, as shown by MEED's research, is substantially discounted from the market price for Emrock's products.443 The Claimant also notes that Boyd assumes a 12% rate of tax on the entire operation after expiration of the 10-year tax exemption, even though Mr Al Tamimi might have been able to structure the business to redirect profits to SFOH, which is based in a tax-free zone.444 Further, Boyd assumes a slow ramp-up to full production, and assumes that production would end eight months prior to the end of the Lease Agreements to allow sufficient time for site reclamation activities.445\n\nClaimant's Reply at [226] and [256]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [79].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [226]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [79]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [7.4.2.4].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [227]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [7.7.11.1].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [265]; Claimant's Reply at [226]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [79]; First Boyd Expert Report, Section 8.1; Second Boyd Expert Report at [6.3.7] and [7.1.1].\n\n220.\n\nTo the extent that the Respondent asserts that it is flawed for Boyd to rely upon a 25-year term of investment (ie its maximum term under the Lease Agreements), the Claimant submits that this is justified under the plain terms of the Lease Agreements and well-established principles of damages.446 The Claimant contends that, in the valuation context, tribunals analyse renewal options in light of legitimate expectations, often based on the terms of the contract.447 In this respect, the Claimant observes that the Lease Agreements made renewal available at the option of Emrock and SFOH, and that those agreements do not place any conditions or requirements on renewal, but merely state that the agreements are \" *extendable* \".448 Even if OMCO's consent to renew were required, the Claimant submits that it would be in OMCO's interest to renew a contract that was generating ongoing royalties for OMCO as the parties' 25-year plan contemplated.449\n\nClaimant's Reply at [246]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [76].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [247]-[248]. The Claimant also notes that tribunals have routinely awarded damages based on an expectation of renewal of a lease term (Claimant's Reply at [247] and [254], relevantly citing *Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation (LETCO) v Republic of Liberia* (ICSID Case No ARB/83/2), Award, 31 March 1986, as rectified 10 June 1986 (**CLA-072**).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [249]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [76].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [255]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [7.4.1.5].\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimant also notes that the business dealings between Emrock, SFOH and OMCO indicate that all parties expected the Lease Agreements would be renewed for their full 25-year term.450 The Claimant submits that he had a legitimate expectation that he would exercise his rights to renew, and that calculating damages based upon that expectation is necessary to restore the Claimant to the rightful position he would have enjoyed but for the wrongful acts of Oman.451\n\nClaimant's Reply at [250]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton, at [76].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [255].\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, contrary to Oman's suggestion, the fact that Boyd limited its analysis to a project cash flow approach does not undermine Boyd's valuation.452 The Claimant notes that the DCF is the most commonly implemented valuation methodology, especially in the valuation of mineral entities, because the unique and local nature of the industry and the different reserve life spans of each entity make comparable sales or EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples difficult.453 In this respect the Claimant contends that Navigant's use of an EBITDA multiplier is flawed: the companies Navigant used for the purposes of comparison are not similarly situated to Emrock, and in any event, an EBITDA multiplier is not a first-line valuation method for a mining concession, because value depends primarily on available reserves, which do not necessarily relate to past earnings.454\n\nClaimant's Reply at [258].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [77].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [259]-[260].\n\n223.\n\nAs a part of the DCF approach, Boyd's valuation of Emrock includes the application of an appropriate discount rate.455 Boyd makes projections through 1 September 2032, then discounts the projected net after tax cash flows to present value applying a discount rate of 10 percent.456 It derived that rate using the WACC typical for large multinational building materials companies of the type likely to be interested in buying the Jebel Wasa quarry (ie the WACC a likely buyer would apply in valuing the quarry).457\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [276].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [259]; Claimant's Reply at [264].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [276]; First Boyd Expert Report at [11.1.2].\n\n224.\n\nTo the extent that the Respondent alleges that the 10 percent discount rate in Boyd's analysis is too low, the Claimant observes that Boyd chose the discount rate based on direct data evidencing the discount rate that a likely buyer would use to value the assets.458 According to the Claimant, in the presence of actual empirical observations of the discount rates used by buyers in the market, it is not necessary or appropriate to resort to a theoretical construct (as Navigant suggests Boyd should have done) to try to reconstruct what such a buyer might pay.459\n\nClaimant's Reply at [264]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [8.2.10]-[8.2.16].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [264]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [8.2.5]-[8.2.6]. See also Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [78].\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimant also notes that it is reasonable for Boyd to have assumed that Emrock would not be subject to income tax for ten years.460 Boyd provides in its first report that the assumption was based upon both statements from Mr Jaime Guzman of OMCO and the terms of the Lease Agreements:461 Mr Guzman had written to the Claimant on 19 September 2005 that Oman routinely \" *awards exemption of the corporate income tax for a period of five years from the beginning of production, with a possible extension for an additional five years* \",462 and the Lease Agreements expressly required OMCO to \" *apply its best endeavors* \" in order to obtain the tax exemption of the income and corporate taxes pursuant to the provision of the tax law provided for a foreign company registered in Oman.463\n\nClaimant's Reply at [265].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [265]; First Boyd Expert Report at [10.3.10.2].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [265]; **Exhibit J-035**.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [265]; **Exhibit J-048**, Art 8(iv) and **Exhibit J-058**, Art 8(iv).\n\n226.\n\nBeyond the fair market value methodology applied by Boyd, the Claimant also defends Boyd's determination of fair market value:\n\n(a) First, the Claimant submits that Boyd's determination regarding the quality of the limestone contained in the concession area is fully supported, and in doing so notes that Boyd reviewed several testing samples which confirmed the high quality of limestone contained throughout the concession area.464\n\n(b) Second, Boyd's projection that Emrock could ramp-up production to reach 25 million tonnes in 2022 is, on the Claimant's case, entirely realistic.465 The Claimant notes that this projection is consistent with the conclusions in the Archibald Expert Report and also with OMCO's own description of the project as a \" *mega quarry and crushing* *project with a very large scale operation* \".466\n\n(c) Third, the Claimant argues that Boyd's assumed product mix is reasonable given the market demand for armour rock, aggregate and chemical stone, and notes in this respect that Emrock did not need an additional permit to excavate limestone-based sand and gravel within the concession area.467\n\n(d) Fourth, Boyd's assumption that Emrock would have diversified its product mix to include chemical stone is fully supported by the facts.468 The Claimant observes that Emrock was in the process of doing so at the time Oman shut it down, and in this regard points to ArcelorMittal (a major steelmaker) contacting Emrock in 2008 in order to establish what it called a \" *long term relationship* \" for the supply of chemical stone.469 Boyd explains that, had Emrock's business continued, it was reasonable to assume that it would have sold chemical stone in the Indian market.470\n\n(e) Fifth, MEED's projection that Emrock could capture 29 percent of the total unmet limestone demand did not require Emrock to compete with existing players' own market share.471 In any event, even if Emrock had to compete with other players, the Claimant notes that Emrock had a number of competitive advantages, in particular its geographic location.472 As the MEED Expert Report notes, Emrock's location provides a \" *shorter distance* \" to the main centres of limestone consumption in the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.473\n\n(f) Finally, the Claimant submits that it is reasonable (even conservative) for Boyd to assume that the Claimant would be entitled to 90 percent of the overall project value.474 The Claimant notes that he owned 100 percent of Emrock's dividends and 80 percent of SFOH's dividends; assuming a 50/50 percent production split between Emrock and SFOH (as anticipated in the environmental applications), the Claimant is therefore entitled to 90 percent of the overall project.475\n\nClaimant's Reply at [267]-[268]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [73]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [4.2.4]-[4.2.14].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [269]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [7.3.1.1]. This projection is roughly five million tonnes higher than the production requirement in the First Boyd Expert Report, and has been amended in the Second Boyd Expert Report in light of the updated mine plan (Second Boyd Expert Report at [7.3.1.1]).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [269]; Archibald Expert Report at [4], [9] and [29]; **Exhibit J-105**.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [270]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [7.1.7].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [271].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [271]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [6.2.7]; Boyd Ref [9-28].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [271]; Second Boyd Expert Report at [6.3.2].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [272]; MEED Expert Report at [21].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [272].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [272]; MEED Expert Report at [151].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [273].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [256] and [278]; Claimant's Reply at [227] and [273].\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, even if Mr Al Tamimi were to meet his burden of demonstrating that Oman violated the US-Oman FTA and directly caused him harm, he would not be entitled to the compensation he seeks because his purported damages model is \" *incurably flawed and inflated to an extent that is entirely fanciful* \".476 The Respondent contends that the Claimant's project had no value as of 1 January 2009 when the US-Oman FTA came into effect, much less on 1 June 2009, the Claimant's purported valuation date.477\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [22] and [453].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [22], [454] and [460]; Oman's Rejoinder at [205] and [220]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [2] and [7].\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent first addresses the standard to be applied. In the event that Oman breached Article 10.6 of the US-Oman FTA (ie the prohibition against expropriation), the Respondent submits that the relevant standard for compensation is equivalent to the \" *fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place* \".478 As to non-expropriatory breaches, the Respondent submits that fair market value is not the proper measure of damages, but rather, the more appropriate standard is loss \" *adequately connected to the breach* \" of the specific provision of the US-Oman FTA.479\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [455], quoting the US-Oman FTA, Art 10.6.1(c).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [456]; Oman's Rejoinder at [208], relevantly citing **CLA-020** / **RLA-16** at [194]. The Claimant submits that this is simply another way of saying that the treaty breach must have caused the damages claims, and it provides no standard for how the amount of the provable loss should be determined (Claimant's PreHearing Skeleton at [57]).\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent observes that while, in principle, a claimant is entitled to recoup all \" *financially assessable damage including lost profits* \", that right is confined to instances when the claimant can demonstrate that the lost profits claim has \" *sufficient attributes to be considered a legally* *protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable* \".480 The Respondent contends that when damages are too remote or uncertain, the claim must be denied.481\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [458]; Oman's Rejoinder at [207], relevantly citing J Crawford, *The International Law* *Commission's Articles on State Responsibility*, Cambridge University Press, 2002, Art 36, Commentary 27 (**RLA-065**).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [457]; Oman's Rejoinder at [206], citing *Metalclad Corporation v United Mexican* *States* (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, 30 August 2000 at [115] (**RLA-029**).\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that, as a general matter, damages must not put a claimant in a better position than he would have been absent the breach, but must instead compensate the claimant only for the losses actually incurred as a result of the wrongful act.482 To achieve this objective, a party must demonstrate a sufficient link between the wrongful act and actual provable damages directly caused by the wrongful act.483\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [459].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [459], citing *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No ARB/05/22), Award, 24 July 2008 at [785] (**RLA-004**).\n\n231.\n\nTurning to the valuation provided by the Claimant's expert, the Respondent refers to Navigant's opinion that the Claimant's project was insolvent and worthless as of 1 June 2009.484 As Navigant explains, \" *none of the evidence provided by Claimant or its three (now conflicting) experts changes* [its] *opinion that the Project failed as an unfortunate consequence of macroeconomic and commercial reasons rather than Oman's actions* \".485\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [220].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [220]; First Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [12].\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the global economic crisis that began to unfold in the fall of 2008 severely depressed economic growth in the Gulf region, and relevantly for this case, caused the real estate and construction sectors to collapse.486 The Respondent contends that, by the end of 2008, the Claimant's project had significant inventories of rock, three months of unpaid receivables with Nakheel (which cancelled its supply contract with Emrock around that same time), and spiralling obligations to equipment providers and banks that Emrock would never pay.487 As explained by Navigant, Emrock's financial statements reveal that by year end 2008 the Claimant's project was experiencing financial distress and illiquidity.488 The Respondent contends that the Claimant's project did not have realistic market prospects as of 1 January 2009 or 1 June 2009.489\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [461]; Second Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [12] and [83]-[84].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [461]; First Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [12] and [120]-[130].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [462]; First Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [120].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [463]. The Respondent also submits that the Claimant has not demonstrated that Emrock had any discernible geographic or logistical advantage over competitor quarries to permit it to capture sufficient business to develop a significant market share in Abu Dhabi. In this respect, the Respondent notes that Mr Al Tamimi was dependent upon Nakheel, and that he had no serious connections in the construction industry elsewhere in the region (Oman's Counter-Memorial at [465]; First Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [103]-[117]).\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that Boyd's valuation cannot assume the Lease Agreements would be renewed for the maximum renewal period.490 The Respondent notes that, as explained by Navigant, Boyd's updated model assumes that 81 percent, or US$236,964,429 of the project's value, would be derived from cash flows arising after the expiration of the initial 10-year term of the Lease Agreements on 1 September 2017.491 The Respondent submits that there is no evidence suggesting the remotest possibility that OMCO would have renewed the Lease Agreements, and as such those damages are entirely speculative.492\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [467]-[476]; Oman's Rejoinder at [209]-[219].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [209]; Second Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [146].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [209].\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent first observes that the Lease Agreements could not later be renewed because they had ceased to exist: the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement was null and void, and OMCO had terminated the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 20 July 2008 and 17 February 2009.493 Second, even if the agreements were still in force and effect, the Respondent submits that renewal was not available at the sole option of Emrock and SFOH.494 Rather, the express wording of those Lease Agreements demonstrates that renewal was conditional and wholly dependent upon the approval of both parties.495 The Respondent notes in this respect that each of the three possible extensions was far from certain: OMCO and Emrock/SFOH demarcated several different points in time when the parties could reassess matters and determine whether to renew the Lease Agreements in light of the then prevailing circumstances.496\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [211].

without any income, the Claimant's companies became insolvent.526 The Claimant also observes that Omani police then forced the Claimant's employees from the quarry site, after which they allowed the site to be looted and destroyed.527 As a result, so the Claimant submits, Oman's actions destroyed Claimant's value in his investment.528\n\nClaimant's Reply at [279].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [279].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [279].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [279].\n\n241.\n\nAs to the second aspect, the Claimant contends that no other factors (in particular, external market forces, the Claimant's own alleged wrongdoing, and OMCO's purported termination of the Lease Agreements) caused the Claimant's losses.529 With respect to market forces, the Claimant submits that Oman's suggestion that Emrock closed, or inevitably would have closed, for economic reasons is contrary to the facts.530 The Claimant argues that Emrock was a promising and well-positioned business that would have achieved significant success but for Oman's treaty violations.531\n\nClaimant's Reply at [280]-[290].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [229]-[244] and [281].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [283].\n\n242.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent submits that the Claimant's alleged misconduct caused his losses, the Claimant repeats his earlier arguments on this subject.532 First, the Claimant submits that SFOH was not required to register in Oman, and even if it had been, the legal consequence for such failure would have been a small fine.533 Second, late payment by Emrock to OMCO was not a cause of the Claimant's loss, as Emrock had timely rendered all payments due to OMCO under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.534 Further, in the event that a payment had been late, OMCO never obtained a judicial decree terminating the Lease Agreement on that basis.535 Finally, the Claimant did not operate outside the concession area, without proper permits, or without a valid license.536\n\nClaimant's Reply at [284]-[287].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [285].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [93] and [286].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [99]-[102], [110] and [279].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [287].\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the purported termination of the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements did not cause his losses.537 As argued in the context of jurisdiction, the Claimant contends that OMCO never effectively terminated the Lease Agreements.538 Additionally, as argued in the context of the merits of his case, the Claimant submits that OMCO's purported termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was itself a breach of the US-Oman FTA.539\n\nClaimant's Reply at [288]-[290].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [89]-[122] and [289].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [204]-[218] and [290].\n\n**(ii) Respondent's position**\n------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the Claimant has not proved that Oman's actions caused the Claimant's alleged losses, and as such, he is precluded from recovering damages in this proceeding.540 The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not met the \u2018test' set out in *Lemire v Ukraine*.541\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [194].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [195].\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's losses, if any, were caused by: (i) external commercial and market forces, including the financial decline of Nakheel; (ii) the Claimant's own wrongdoing; and (iii) OMCO's termination of the Lease Agreements.542\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [21] and [440]-[450]; Oman's Rejoinder at [197]-[204].\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the loss in December 2008 of Nakheel, Mr Al Tamimi's only customer for the hard rock mined in the Jebel Wasa quarry, owing to the economic crisis that swept the Gulf region, spelled the end of the Claimant's project in Oman.543 Although there were numerous causes for the project's decline, the Respondent submits that the Claimant would not have been able to overcome the loss of Nakheel even if the project had not otherwise been crippled by Mr Al Tamimi's actions.544 The Respondent notes that the Claimant had no other long term customers at the time of Oman's alleged FTA breach, and any claim that he could secure additional customers is belied by the relevant macroeconomic conditions.545\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [441]; Oman's Rejoinder at [197]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [31]-[33]. The Respondent relies on the First Navigant Consulting Expert Report and the Second Navigant Consulting Expert Report in support of its submission (Navigant explains that macroeconomic factors and Nakheel's withdrawal from the supply contract with Emrock caused the Claimant's investment in his project to become worthless: First Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [133] and [134]; Second Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [10]). The Respondent also relies upon certain alleged concessions by the Claimant that he was unable to meet his ongoing obligations due to Nakheel's decision to declare *force majeure* under its contract with Emrock (Oman's Counter-Memorial at [444]; Oman's Rejoinder at [198]).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [441].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [199], citing in support the Elite Media Expert Report at [15] and [22], and the Second Navigant Consulting Expert Report at [108].\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant's own actions materially contributed to his alleged losses.546 The Respondent in particular points to Mr Al Tamimi's insistent unauthorised actions outside the approved area for mining; his failure to register SFOH; his failure to make timely payments under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement; and his failure to obtain the required approvals and authorisations.547 The Respondent contends that these failures (Nakheel aside) were fatal to the viability of the Claimant's purported investment.548\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [445]-[449]; Oman's Rejoinder at [202].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [448].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [449].\n\n248.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that any losses suffered by the Claimant were caused by the end of the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements.549 As the acts of OMCO are not attributable to Oman under the US-Oman FTA, the Claimant cannot show that any breach of the FTA by Oman was the proximate cause of any loss he might have suffered after 1 January 2009.550\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [450]; Oman's Rejoinder at [203]-[204].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [450].\n\n**(c) Moral damages**\n---------------------\n\n**(i) Claimant's position**\n---------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIn addition to economic damages, the Claimant also seeks moral damages of US$10 million.551 The Claimant submits that he has suffered both material and non-material damages as a result of Oman's wrongful actions, and argues that compensation only for material damages will fall short of wiping out all of the consequences of Oman's violations of the US-Oman FTA.552 In this respect, the Claimant contends that \" *[t]he constant interference with his business, the repeated harassment by agents of the Omani government including ministry agents and police, the false criminal and civil allegations against him by the Omani ministries, police, state prosecutor, and OMCO, his detention, eviction, and ultimate destruction of his business represent moral damages which must be compensated* \".553\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [251], [279]-[287] and [290]; Claimant's Reply at [11], [291]-[302] and [304]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [57] and [65].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [294].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [294].\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimant observes that, pursuant to Article 10.21 of the US-Oman FTA, this arbitration is governed by \" *applicable rules of international law* \".554 The Claimant submits that a well-settled principle of customary international law is that a State must \" *make full reparation for the injury caused by* [its] *internationally wrongful act* \".555 The Claimant contends that such principle requires both compensation for economic loss but also for moral damage caused by the State's internationally wrongful act.556\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [279].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [279]; Claimant's Reply at [292], quoting International Law Commission, *Articles on* *Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts*, Art 31(1) (**CLA-005**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [251] and [279]; Claimant's Reply at [292], relevantly citing **CLA-005**, Art 31(2).

The Claimant relevantly notes that:\n\n(a) As in *Desert Line*, where the claimant's personnel were confronted, threatened, detained, and the claimant was coerced into a settlement, Mr Al Tamimi suffered physical intimidation, detention, humiliation and reputational harm and was forced to close his quarry or face indefinite detention for vague, unsubstantiated reasons.563\n\n(b) As in *Diallo*, Mr Al Tamimi incurred psychological stress from an arbitrary arrest and suffered reputational damage caused by the Respondent in forcing him to leave Oman and sever his business ties.564\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [283]\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [283]; **CLA-031 / RLA-011** at [40]-[43], [194] and [289].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [285]; **CLA-036** / **RLA-001** at [21].\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimant notes that, as in *Desert Line* and *Diallo*, the award of moral damages in addition to economic damages is necessary in this case to fully compensate the Claimant for the anxiety, reputational damage and humiliation inflicted upon him by Oman.565\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [284] and [285]; **CLA-031** / **RLA-011** at [289]; **CLA-036** / **RLA-001** at [25].\n\n**(ii) Respondent's position**\n------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent, however, describes Mr Al Tamimi's claim for moral damages as \" *baseless* \", and submits that he has not satisfied (and cannot satisfy) the extraordinary tests required for moral damages.566 By reference to, relevantly, the awards in *Lemire v Ukraine* and *Europe Cement v Turkey*,567 the Respondent notes that moral damages are exceptional and permitted only in the most egregious circumstances.568 In this regard, the Respondent observes that international tribunals have routinely rejected claims for moral damages in investment treaty cases.569\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [489] and [499]; Oman's Rejoinder at [229] and [237].\n\n*Europe Cement Investment & Trade SA v Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/07/2), Award, 13 August 2009 (**RLA-015**).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [490]-[491]; Oman's Rejoinder at [231]-[234]; **CLA-035** / **RLA-025** at [333]; **RLA-015** at [181]. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's characterisation of the standard for moral damages is artificially heightened and without support (Claimant's Reply at [291] and [295]).

US SUBMISSION AND PARTIES' RESPONSES**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) US Submission**\n---------------------\n\n257.\n\nAmong the questions scheduled by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 11 are the following two:\n\n*Footnote 1 of Chapter 10, requires that Art 10.5, the Minimum Standard of Treatment clause be interpreted in accordance with Annex 10-A. Under Annex 10-A, does a claimant bear the burden of proving the existence of an applicable rule of customary international law that is claimed to be breached by a respondent?*\n\n*Article 10.15(1)(a)(i) of the FTA permits the Tribunal to determine whether there has been a breach of any obligation set forth in s A of that Chapter. Article 10.21, Governing Law, requires the Tribunal to \"...decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\" What is the relationship between the Tribunal's subject-matter jurisdiction and the Governing Law clause?*\n\n258.\n\nIn response, as noted above, the United States of America (the \" ***United States*** \"), a non-disputing party, exercised its right under Article 10.19.2 of the FTA by filing a submission (the \" ***US Submission*** \") on 22 September 2014. The US Submission addressed the following two points: (1) the burden to establish the content of customary international law; and (2) the governing law clause in Article 10.21.\n\n259.\n\nWith respect to the first point, the United States argued that \" *[t]he burden is on a claimant to* *establish the existence and applicability of a relevant obligation under customary international law that is not otherwise incorporated expressly in the text of Art 10.5* \" (internal citation omitted). In support of its argument, the US Submission relied on the arbitral decisions in *Cargill Inc v Mexico, ADF v United States*, *Glamis Gold v United States* and *Methanex v United States* which, the United States contended, place the burden of establishing the content of customary international law on the claimant.\n\n260.\n\nThe criteria for a claimant to establish the existence of a rule of customary international law, the United States submitted, are listed in Annex 10-A. The same are recognised by the International Court of Justice. The decisions of arbitral tribunals interpreting fair and equitable treatment and full security and protection provisions that fall outside the scope of customary international law cannot be used as evidence of the content of the customary international law standard found in Art 10.5 and Annex 10-A.\n\n261.\n\nMoreover, the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, the United States submitted, does not include a general obligation of proportionality. Proportionality is not a self-standing obligation. Once customary international law has been established, the claimant must show that the State has engaged in conduct that has violated it. The breach must be established in light of the high measure of deference that international law gives to States when it comes to regulating matters within their borders.577\n\n*SD Myers v Canada*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, First Partial Award, 13 November 2000 at [263].\n\n262.\n\nWith respect to the governing law clause in Article 10.21, the second point addressed in the US Submission, it requires the Tribunal to apply international law when interpreting the provisions of Chapter 10.A and when deciding claims of breach of Chapter 10.A. Article 10.21 limits the Tribunal's jurisdiction to claims of breach of the obligations found in Chapter 10.A.\n\n**(b) Claimant's response**\n---------------------------\n\n263.\n\nIn its submission of 31 October 2014 in response, the Claimant made the following three-part argument: (i) the matters addressed in the United States Submission are either irrelevant or beyond the scope of Article 10.19.2 of the FTA; (ii) the United States does not dispute that proportionality is relevant to claims of expropriation and denial of national treatment, or even claims of violation of the minimum standard of treatment; and (iii) the requirement of proportionality is well established as a component of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. Each of these points is summarised below:\n\na. First, according to the Claimant, the United States' view on questions of treaty interpretation are consistent with those of the Parties and need not be decided by the Tribunal. These views are: (i) that Article 10.5 and Annex 10-A incorporate customary international law standards rather than \"an autonomous treaty-based standard\"; and (ii) that the governing law clause in Article 10.21 does not extend the Tribunal's jurisdiction to include claims arising outside the FTA or undo the requirements of the Annex 10-A. However, the United States' views on questions of customary international law are improper under Article 10.19.2 for two reasons, and the Tribunal is entitled to ignore the US Submission in this regard. The burden of proof and the weight to be given to various evidence of customary international law are evidentiary and procedural matters that are neither addressed by the FTA nor are they issues of treaty interpretation. Moreover, the US submission goes further than addressing the burden of proof by commenting on the sufficiency of the evidence and the content of customary international law.\n\nb. Second, on the issue of proportionality, the US Submission is not inconsistent with the Claimant's position. The United States concedes that proportionality may be \" *one factor in a discussion of expropriation* \". In this regard, the Claimant's argument is that for Oman to be found not to have expropriated the Claimant's investment, it has to show *prima facie* that its shutdown of the quarry was a justified exercise of its police power and was not a disproportionate response to the alleged environmental irregularities. Moreover, the United States does not dispute that disproportionate treatment is relevant to the Claimant's national treatment claim. Here, the Claimant's argument is that it was treated with disproportionate harshness compared to local Omanis, so Oman had to prove that it had reasonable grounds for such differential treatment. Finally, the United States does not argue that proportionality is irrelevant to the Claimant's argument on the minimum standard of treatment. The United States only argues that proportionality is not an independent source of obligation within the minimum standard of treatment. The FTA is explicit that the minimum standard of treatment includes fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. Fair and equitable treatment \" *necessarily implies that a state has an obligation not to apply penalties or restrictions that are seriously disproportionate to the violation that the state seeks to penalize or the harm the state seeks to prevent* \".578\n\nc. Third, according to the Claimant, arbitral tribunals have recognised, contrary to the United States' arguments, that proportionality is a part of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. Also, the views of the United States are not binding on the Tribunal under Article 10.19.2 of the FTA and the United States does not contend so. This is in contrast to Articles 10.21.3 and 19.2.3(b) which establish procedures for adopting binding interpretations of the FTA.\n\nd. In addition, the US Submission assumes, in error, that the burden of proof applies to questions of law. However, numerous courts and tribunals have held that the doctrine of *jura novit curia* applies to questions of law, thus the Tribunal is free to determine questions of customary international law. The United States relies on *Glamis Gold*, *Cargill*, and several other cases. *Glamis Gold* gives little reasoning to support its conclusion that the Claimant has the burden of proving customary international law. The tribunal in *Cargill* acknowledged that its view, that the claimant has the burden of proof of change of customary international law, was a departure from the views of other tribunals. The other cases relied upon by the Claimant, ie *ADF Group*, *Methanex*, and *North Sea Continental Shelf*, do not decide the question of burden of proof. The United States cited yet other cases, none of which support its position.\n\ne. In any event, if the Claimant has the burden of proof, it has met it. Tribunals have recognised proportionality as a freestanding requirement of fair and equitable treatment under the minimum standard of treatment. The United States, in arguing that the Claimant bears the burden of proving the content of customary international law, does not dispute that arbitral decisions may constitute sufficient evidence, especially since the United States itself relies on such decisions to support its arguments. What the United States disputes is relying on awards decided under autonomous treaty standards, rather than customary international law. However, tribunals have found no difference between fair and equitable treatment based on treaties versus customary international law, and proportionality has been found to be a part of the minimum standard of treatment in either instance.\n\nClaimant's Response to US Submission at [15].\n\n**(c) Respondent's response**\n-----------------------------\n\n264.\n\nThe Respondent makes two main arguments in its submission of 31 October 2014: (i) the US Submission addresses issues of treaty interpretation; and (ii) the US submission has reaffirmed accepted rules of law. These are summarised below:\n\na. First, the Respondent argued that the United States offers its general views on the nature and scope of the obligations to which it has agreed, and by implication not agreed. The substance or content of the minimum standard of treatment obligation is what defines the signatory parties' obligations under the FTA. The Claimant's burden \" *to establish the existence and applicability of a relevant obligation under customary international law that is not otherwise incorporated expressly in the text of Art 10.5* \" is precisely the type of issue on which the signatory parties are expected to provide their views. The United States made a similar submission in *Railroad Development Corp v Guatemala*.\n\nb. Second, the Respondent submitted that there is abundant authority supporting the view that the party seeking to rely on customary international law bears the burden of proving the existence and content of that law. Disagreeing with the Claimant, the Respondent added that the four decisions in *Cargill*, *ADF*, *Glamis Gold*, and *Methanex* all support its view. It is a two-part test based on consistent State practice and an understanding that the practice is required by law. Here, Mr Al Tamimi has failed to carry his burden to prove, based on either, that the doctrine of proportionality is part of customary international law cognisable under the FTA.\n\nc. In addition, the Respondent submitted that the Claimant's interpretation of the doctrine of *jura novit curia* is flawed in that the doctrine allows a tribunal to take judicial notice of certain legal authorities or pre-existing laws and regulations to ascertain and apply the governing law. The Respondent cited a number of decisions that it claimed support this view. For example, in *Glamis Gold* the tribunal found that \" *the inquiry as to whether particular rules have become part of customary international law is \u2018necessarily a factual inquiry, looking to the actions of States and the motives for and consistency of these actions*\u00a0'\".579 In *Patrick Mitchell v Democratic Republic of Congo*, the annulment committee found that \" *while tribunals may have jura novit curia powers, they are not obliged to exercise them* \".580 The tribunals in *CME Czech Republic BV v Czech Republic* and *Cargill* reached similar conclusions.\n\nd. The question whether a particular rule has attained the status of customary international law cannot be answered by looking to arbitral tribunals' decisions. Such decisions interpreting certain provisions do not constitute evidence of the content of customary international law required by Article 10.5 and Annex 10-A.\n\ne. The Respondent argued that many of the cases cited by the Claimant do not support his claims of proportionality. Notably, the reference to *Occidental* cannot, without more, satisfy the burden of proving that the doctrine of proportionality has become a part of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, because the decision is not grounded in the type of evidence necessary to prove State practice and *opinio juris*.\n\nf. According to the Respondent, the Claimant's proportionality claim is that OMCO acted disproportionally when it terminated the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement for relatively small sums Emrock owed to OMCO. However, OMCO's actions are not attributable to Oman, which precludes an investment treaty claim based on the termination. In addition, OMCO had a unilateral right to terminate the Agreement based on Emrock's non-payment, without regard to the amount due or the duration of the debt. Principles of customary international law would be applicable here only if Oman had exercised its sovereign power to direct OMCO's action, which was not the case.\n\ng. Similarly, the Claimant's claims that the doctrine of proportionality should have a bearing on the Tribunal's assessment of Mr Al Tamimi's arrest as well as the police shutdown of the project site are both unfounded.\n\nh. Lastly, the Respondent contended that the United States' submission correctly confirms that the governing law clause does not expand the Tribunal's jurisdiction, which is limited to breaches of the obligations listed in Chapter 10 of the FTA.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v United States* (NAFTA/UNCITRAL), Award, 8 June 2009 at [607].\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v Democratic Republic of Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision, 9 February 2004 at [57].\n\n**VI. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n**(a) Jurisdiction** ***ratione personae***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe first issue to be considered is whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Claimant, Mr Al Tamimi. The question can be dealt with briefly, both because the answer is clear and because the Respondent has not actively pursued its challenge to Mr Al Tamimi's nationality.581 The Tribunal finds that there is no evidential basis for the Respondent's suggestion that Mr Al Tamimi is unable to rely on the US-Oman FTA by virtue of his nationality.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent did not present argument on this issue at the hearing, nor in its Rejoinder or PreHearing Skeleton. At the Hearing, however, the Respondent indicated that its objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* had not been withdrawn: Transcript, Day 9 at 224:12-22 (Oman's closing address). The Respondent confirmed in its Post-Hearing Answers that it \" *has not abandoned this defense* \u2019, again without making any further submissions: Respondent's Post-Hearing Answers at 1. The Tribunal must therefore rely solely on the submissions made in respect of this issue in the Respondent's Counter-Memorial at [263]-[266].\n\n266.\n\nChapter 10 of the US-Oman FTA,582 headed *\"\"Investment\u2019,* applies only to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to the covered investments of \" *investors of the other Party* \".583 Article 10.27 defines \" *investor of a Party*\u00a0\" in the following terms:\n\n***investor of a Party***  *means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment* *in the territory of the other Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality.*\n\n**Exhibit J-001**.\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.1.\n\n267.\n\nThe meaning of *\"\"national* [...] *of a party\u2019* is defined in Article 1.2 of the FTA:\n\n***national***  *means:*\n\n*(a) with respect to Oman, any person who is a citizen within the meaning of its domestic laws governing nationality; and*\n\n*(b) with respect to the United States, \"national of the United States\" as defined in Title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act;*\n\n268.\n\nThe ICSID Convention also defines the meaning of \" *national of another Contracting State* \" for its purposes under Art 25(2), relevantly including:584\n\n[...] *any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than* *the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit* *such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered* [\u2026]\n\nICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules, April 2006, Art 25(2) (**CLA-010**).\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Mr Al Tamimi only if it can be established that: (a) he is a national of the United States, as defined in Title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act; and (b) he has made, or has attempted to make, an investment in the territory of Oman. The second limb will be discussed in further detail in the context of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* below; it suffices for now to observe that the Respondent has not disputed the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* based on this latter criterion.\n\n270.\n\nIn respect of the first limb, the Respondent has not provided a factual basis for a finding that Mr Al Tamimi is anything other than a national of the United States as defined in Title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That provision provides that a person may become a citizen of the United States of America either through birth or through naturalisation. Mr Al Tamimi has tendered in evidence his US government-issued Certificate of Naturalization, which shows that he became a naturalised US citizen within the meaning of Title III on 11 June 1980.585 Mr Al Tamimi is also the bearer of a current US passport.586 The Respondent has not contested the validity of either of these documents.\n\nUnited States of America Certificate of Naturalization of Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi (**Exhibit J-006**).\n\nUnited States of America Passport, issued to Adel A Fadili on 25 April 2006 and 26 September 2008 and United States of America Passport, issued to Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi on 20 October 2009 (**Exhibit J-004**).\n\n271.\n\nRather, the Respondent has suggested that Mr Al Tamimi \" *appears* \" also to be a national of the United Arab Emirates, and that pursuant to Article 10.27 his \" *dominant and effective nationality* \" is Emirati rather than American.587 The Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to conclude Mr Al Tamimi is a dual national. Mr Al Tamimi has acknowledged that he was born as a citizen of the Emirate of Sharjah, which now constitutes part of the UAE.588 However it seems clear that, pursuant to Article 15 of the UAE Law Concerning Nationality, Passports and Amendments thereof, Mr Al Tamimi lost whatever Emirati citizenship he previously possessed when he voluntarily adopted the nationality of the United States in 1980. That provision states that:589\n\n*Article (15)*\n\n*Nationality of the country shall be lost from any person enjoying such nationality in the following cases:*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*C. If he has adopted, voluntarily, a nationality of another country.*\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial at [263].\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [126].\n\nFederal Law No (17) for 1972, Concerning Nationality, Passports and Amendments thereof, Art 15(C) (**Exhibit J-** **003**). The Claimant has further submitted, citing the wording of the US Oath of Allegiance, that renunciation of his Emirati citizenship was also a requirement of his US nationalisation: see Claimant's Reply at [127]-[128]; 8 USC \u00a7 1448(a)(2) (**CLA-045**). However, it is not clear on the evidence what effect in practice the taking of the US Oath of Allegiance has on the continuance of existing citizenships.\n\n272.\n\nThis has been the position taken by the Claimant since his Notice of Intent dated 19 April 2011:590\n\n*The investor in this dispute is Mr Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi. He is a naturalized citizen of the United States of America. Prior to obtaining his American citizenship* *in 1986, Mr Al Tamimi was a national of the United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\"). Mr Al* *Tamimi no longer holds UAE nationality.*\n\nClaimant's Notice of Intent at [7]. In response, the Respondent has said that \" *[i]t seems that it is not uncommon for UAE citizens to have UAE passports despite becoming citizens of the US or other countries* \": Oman's CounterMemorial at [266]. It has, however, produced no evidence to support this assertion.\n\n273.\n\nMr Al Tamimi has given evidence that since his naturalisation as a US citizen he has not applied for, obtained or claimed nationality or citizenship in any other country.591 The Respondent has not produced any evidence to the contrary.592 Indeed, all documents relevant to this arbitration, filed with the UAE and Omani authorities, list Mr Al Tamimi's nationality exclusively as \"American\".593 The Tribunal therefore finds on the evidence presented to it that Mr Al Tamimi is a national of, and only of, the United States of America for the purposes of Chapter 10 of the US-Oman FTA.\n\nSecond Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [24].\n\nIndeed, even if Mr Al Tamimi had sought Emirati nationality since 1980, it appears that under UAE law Mr Al Tamimi would only be able to regain his Emirati nationality if he first renounced his American citizenship: **Exhibit J-003**, Art 17.\n\nSee eg **Exhibit J-054** at 13; Memorandum of Association of Emrock Aggregate & Mining (LLC) among Eurogulf LLC and Atlas Capital Limited and Mr. Mashal Sadek Abdullah Algrgawi and Mr. Abdul A Fadili dated 16 April 2007 (**Exhibit J-093**) at 1; Certificate of Commercial Registration of Emrock, dated 2 May 2007 (**Exhibit J-088**) at 2.\n\n274.\n\nIn any event, as a matter of interpretation of Article 10.27, the Tribunal does not consider that the language of \" *dominant and effective nationality* \" is intended to prevent dual citizens of both the United States and a third-party State, such as the UAE, from invoking the US-Oman BIT - even where the nationality of the third-party State is predominant. Rather, the Tribunal considers that the provision is aimed at preventing claims by dual nationals of ***both*** State parties (ie the United States and Oman) from seeking to use the FTA to claim against their own State of dominant and effective nationality -thereby defeating the purpose of the FTA to apply investment protection only to \" *investors of the other Party*\u00a0\". However, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to definitively determine this interpretative point because the evidence does not disclose that Mr Al Tamimi is a national of any country other than the United States.\n\n(b) **Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nPursuant to Art 10.1, the investment protections contained in Chapter 10 of the US-Oman FTA apply only to \" *covered investments*\u00a0\".594 The meaning of \" *covered investment*\u00a0\" is defined under Article 1.3:\n\n***covered investment***  *means, with respect to a Party, an investment, as defined in Article 10.27 (Definitions), in its territory of an investor of the other Party in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter;*\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.1\n\n276.\n\nSimilarly, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part that:595\n\n*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State* [\u2026] *and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.*\n\n**CLA-010**, Art 25(1).\n\n277.\n\nThe meaning of \" *investment*\u00a0\" is relevantly defined in Article 10.27 of the US-Oman FTA:\n\n***investment***  *means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk. Forms that an investment may take include:*\n\n*(a) an enterprise;*\n\n*(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;*\n\n*(c) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans;*\n\n*(d) futures, options, and other derivatives;*\n\n*(e) turnkey, construction, management, production, concession, revenuesharing, and other similar contracts;*\n\n*(f) intellectual property rights;*\n\n*(g) licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred pursuant to domestic law; and*\n\n*(h) other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;*\n\n278.\n\nMr Al Tamimi has framed his claim on the basis that his primary investment in Oman consisted of the two Lease Agreements signed between his companies, Emrock and SFOH, and OMCO: namely, the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement and the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement.596 The Tribunal is satisfied that these Lease Agreements meet the requirements of Articles 1.3 and 10.27 of the US-Oman FTA for protection under the Treaty. Article 10.27(h) specifically includes within the scope of covered investments \" *other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related property rights,*  ***such as leases*** [\u2026]\".597 The two Lease Agreements also exhibit the exemplary characteristics described in Article 10.27 above: the commitment of capital and other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, and the assumption of risk. Accordingly the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in respect of the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements, out of which a dispute between the Claimant and Respondent directly arises.\n\nSee Request at [77]-[78].\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimant has also referred to physical infrastructure and equipment at the quarry site as forming part of his investment: \" *equipment, machinery, spare parts, and services that he purchased to make the [q]uarry operational* \".598 The Claimant has submitted that these physical assets cost him \" *tens of millions of dollars* \".599 They too form part of Mr Al Tamimi's claims against Oman: in 2009, Mr Al Tamimi has alleged, the physical infrastructure and equipment at the quarry site was \" *wrecked, looted, and dismantled with the aid of heavy equipment* \", either at the direction of the Omani authorities or at their sufferance.600\n\nRequest at [79].\n\nRequest at [79]. See also Claimant's Memorial at [184] (\" *[v]ery expensive quarrying equipment* \"); Claimant's Reply at [8] (\" *[t]he infrastructure and equipment at the quarry reflected millions of dollars of investment of Claimant's own money* \"); First Gupta Witness Statement at [27]-[43].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [1], [150]-[155].\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that these physical assets additionally meet the test for a covered investment under Articles 1.3 and 10.27. They too fall within the Article 10.27(h) definition of \" *other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property* \", and involve the commitment of capital, the expectation of gain or profit and the assumption of risk. Although intimately tied to the two Lease Agreements, by virtue of which the Claimant was permitted to establish physical infrastructure and equipment at the quarry site, the Tribunal is satisfied that these physical assets constitute an independent investment in their own right, out of which a dispute additionally arises for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.\n\n281.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers it worthy of note that Mr Al Tamimi was not in fact the direct owner of the investments in respect of which he now claims protection. Rather, Mr Al Tamimi invested in Oman through the corporate vehicles of Emrock and SFOH. Mr Al Tamimi owns only 49% of the shares in Emrock (a requirement under UAE law),601 although he claims sole executive decision-making authority over the company.602 Mr Al Tamimi owns 100% of the shares in SFOH.603\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [130].\n\nSee Request for Arbitration at [20]. The remaining 51% of shares in Emrock is owned by Mr Al Tamimi's nephew: see Request for Arbitration, fn 11.\n\nRequest for Arbitration at [21]; Claimant's Memorial at [21].\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent has not challenged Mr Al Tamimi's entitlement to bring the present proceedings in respect of assets owned and controlled by him only indirectly. The Tribunal therefore does not consider it necessary to make a direct ruling on this issue. It suffices to observe that although recent ICSID tribunals have reached varying positions on the standing (\" *ius standi*\u00a0\") of parties to bring investment protection claims in respect of assets held or controlled only indirectly, the language of Article 10.27 (\" *owns or controls, directly or indirectly*\u00a0\") is sufficiently broad to encompass Mr Al Tamimi's claims.\n\n**(c) Jurisdiction** ***ratione temporis***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe US-Oman FTA came into force on 1 January 2009. There is no suggestion in the language of the Treaty that the investment protections of Chapter 10 were intended to apply with retrospective effect.604 Indeed, the definition of \" *covered investment*\u00a0\", cited at [275] above, stipulates that in order to qualify for the purposes of Chapter 10 an investment must be either \" *in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement*\u00a0\" or else established thereafter. Equally, Article 10.1 provides that Chapter 10 will apply only to measures \" *adopted or maintained*\u00a0\" by a party affecting an investment, which presupposes the existence of an investment after 1 January 2009.605 The Claimant has acknowledged that the effect of Article 10.1 is that investment protection can apply only to measures taken or maintained against an investment after the Treaty entered into force.606\n\nSee Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Art 28 (**CLA-001**) (\" *Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party* \u2019).\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.1.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [171]-[172] (\" *to be clear, Mr Al Tamimi does not allege that the pre-entry-into-force conduct of Oman constitutes a breach of obligations under the FTA, and he is not seeking an award of damages for that conduct* \").\n\n284.\n\nAs previously noted, Mr Al Tamimi's primary investment in Oman comprised the OMCO-Em rock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements. The Respondent has argued that both agreements ceased to have effect prior to the entry into force of the US-Oman FTA on 1 January 2009: the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, it says, was terminated by OMCO on 20 July 2008, while the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement was rendered \" *null and void* \" by 2 June 2008 at the latest, owing to SFOH's failure to register in Oman as required by Omani law.607\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [11].\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal finds below that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was not terminated until after 1 January 2009, with the result that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over that agreement. In respect of the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement, however, the Tribunal finds that as a result of SFOH's failure to register in Oman that agreement was rendered null and void prior to 1 January 2009. The Tribunal therefore has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the latter agreement.\n\n**(i) The OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement**\n---------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nOMCO first purported to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 20 July 2008, when it sent Mr Al Tamimi, in his capacity as Chairman of Emrock, a letter declaring termination under Article 10(iv) for \" *non-compliance with payment obligations* \".608 The Respondent has said that this breach was triggered by Mr Al Tamimi's failure to reimburse, *inter alia*, a RO 10,000 fine which OMCO had paid to the Ministry of Commerce on Emrock's behalf.609 The termination notice of 20 July 2008 declared that \" *we* [OMCO] *hereby terminate* [the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement] *with immediate effect* \".610\n\n**Exhibit J-199**.\n\nSee Oman's Counter-Memorial at [146]-[148].\n\n**Exhibit J-199**.\n\n287.\n\nThe termination notice was sent on 20 July 2008, many months before the coming into force of the US-Oman FTA on 1 January 2009. If this letter had the effect of ending the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, then the Tribunal can possess no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over that investment.\n\n288.\n\nThe evidence shows, however, that the parties did not act in a manner consistent with the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement at that date. Most significantly, on 17 February 2009, OMCO sent Mr Al Tamimi a second termination notice. That second notice referred again to Article 10(iv) and Emrock's purported \" *non-compliance with payment obligations*\u00a0\", and again stated that \" *we* [OMCO] *hereby terminate* [the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement] *with immediate effect because EMROCK has not complied with making payments to us*\u00a0\".611\n\n**Exhibit J-250**.\n\n289.\n\nIt is true, as the Respondent has submitted, there is no evidence that the OMCO Board of Directors ever expressly rescinded or otherwise vacated the termination notice of 20 July 2008. Equally, however, the language and intent of the second termination notice of 17 February 2009 demonstrate that this second notice was not intended as a mere reaffirmation of the 20 July 2008 notice. The use of the wording \" *we*  ***hereby***  *terminate*\u00a0\" and \" *with*  ***immediate***  *effect*\u00a0\" in the second notice, for instance, indicates that OMCO did not consider that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement had already been terminated.612 The schedule of late payments attached to the second termination notice, on which OMCO relied as its ground for termination, was additionally updated in the second termination notice to 13 February 2009.613 As the Claimant has submitted, \" *Oman's assertion that the 2009 termination notice was just a reiteration or confirmation of the 2008 notice is inconsistent with the language of the 2009 notice itself*\u00a0\".614\n\nEmphasis added. For a contrast, see the language of the letter sent by OMCO to Mr Al Tamimi in his capacity as Chairman of SFOH on 2 June 2008, cited below at [294], which clearly described the purpose of the notice merely \" *to reiterate*\u00a0\" OMCO's earlier determination that the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement would be treated as null and void after 30 November 2007 if SFOH failed to register in Oman.\n\n**Exhibit J-250**.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [43].\n\n290.\n\nMoreover, subsequent communications between OMCO and Emrock, as well as communications between OMCO and the Omani government, plainly indicate OMCO's understanding that the lease was not terminated until 2009.615 The Respondent has submitted that the reaffirmation of OMCO's decision to terminate the lease was delayed until after 1 January 2009 only because of a change in leadership at OMCO.616 Yet in the Tribunal's view, the fact that the OMCO Board of Directors determined to defer issuing the second termination notice until after the installation of its new Chairman, H E Al Dheeb, strongly suggests that the Board did not consider its earlier termination notice to have been effective. Rather, the Board wished to wait for the input of its new Chairman before deciding whether finally to terminate Emrock's lease. The Respondent's submissions have effectively acknowledged this point:617\n\n*The OMCO's Board's willingness to reconsider the matter culminated in the Board's meeting with H E Maqbool in September 2008, when H E Maqbool said it* *was up to the Board to proceed with the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement if it believed it had legal justification for doing so.* [\u2026] *But for the fact* *that OMCO's Chairman, Dr Al Azri, stepped down from that position in late 2008,* *the Board would have reaffirmed the decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement before 1 January 2009.*\n\n**Exhibit J-340, Exhibit J-341**, **Exhibit J-342**.The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's argument that these references all resulted from the same repeated typographical error: see Rejoinder at fn 162.\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [81]; Oman's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [18].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [81].\n\n291.\n\nIn the meantime, between July 2008 and February 2009, OMCO continued to allow Emrock to operate at the site.618 Although OMCO had advised Mr Al Tamimi in July 2008 to \" *stop quarrying, processing and removal of materials from our site at Jebel Wasa* \", it does not appear that this instruction was ever directly followed up or enforced prior to February 2009.619 Indeed, as the abovequoted passage from the Respondent's submissions makes clear, the OMCO board had decided to \" *reconsider* \" the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement in August 2008, and met with Minister of Commerce H E Maqbool in September 2008 for that purpose.620 Mr Al Tamimi has also alleged that he received contrary messages from government officials at this time as to the validity of OMCO's termination of the lease agreement.621 Although the evidence shows that by December 2008 OMCO's management and the necessary majority of the company's existing board members continued to support terminating the Emrock contract,622 it would not have been, in the Tribunal's view, unreasonable for Mr Al Tamimi to assume before February 2009 that the termination had at the very least been put on hold, if not rescinded, by OMCO.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [102]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [41].\n\nSee **Exhibit J-198** ; Letter from Dr Al Azri to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 27 July 2008 (**Exhibit J-202**).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [159]-[164].\n\nMr Al Tamimi gave evidence that he was informed by Dr Hilal, the chairman of OMCO, by telephone around 29 July 2008 that he should ignore the first termination notice, and that H E Maimani, Undersecretary for Administrative & Financial and Regional Affairs at MOCI, also told him to ignore OMCO's termination notice at a meeting on 28 July 2008: First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [156]-[157], although there is no contemporaneous written evidence of these events. There is, however, a letter on the record addressed from H E Ahmed Al Dheeb, Undersecretary for MOCI (although the Respondent says the letter was in fact approved by H E Al Maimani: see Oman's CounterMemorial at [158]), to H E Dr Al Azri, Chairman of OMCO, dated 10 August 2008, in which H E Al Dheeb expressed the Ministry's view the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement should continue: **Exhibit J-204**.\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to MOCI, dated 16 December 2008 (**Exhibit J-230**). In that letter, OMCO referred to a \"[d]raft letter for termination\" prepared by its lawyers, Trowers & Hamlin, and noted that it had still been receiving legal advice on the decision to terminate in November 2008.\n\n292.\n\nIn light of this evidence, the Tribunal finds that the second termination notice of 17 February 2009 must be taken to have superseded the earlier notice of 20 July 2008, with the effect that the earlier notice was rendered ineffective. In other words, the specification of a 2009 termination date in the second termination notice (\" *we hereby terminate* [\u2026] *with immediate effect*\u00a0\") effectively waived the earlier purported termination date.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that it possesses jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, which remained in existence as of 1 January 2009.\n\n**(ii) The OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement**\n--------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent has further claimed that the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement was rendered \" *null and void*\u00a0\" prior to 1 January 2009 because SFOH was never registered in Oman.623 It is, indeed, common ground that SFOH - a company established in the UAE624 - was never registered in Oman.625\n\nSee eg Oman's Counter-Memorial at [269ff].\n\n**Exhibit J-054**.\n\nSee Oman's Counter-Memorial at [269]; Claimant's Reply at [112]. Emrock, in contrast, was registered in Oman as operating company Emrock Oman Branch LLC: **Exhibit J-088**.\n\n295.\n\nThe OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement was signed on 25 May 2006.626 On 11 September 2006, Mr Jaime Guzman of OMCO wrote to Emrock and SFOH reminded those companies that as a \" *crucial* [\u2026] *necessary and mandatory first step*\u00a0\" they each needed to register in Oman.627 Mr Van der Wiele too informed Mr Al Tamimi by email 17 October 2006 that Emrock and SFOH needed to apply to register before seeking environmental approval from MECA.628\n\n**Exhibit J-058.**\n\nEmail from Mr Guzman to Mr Gupta, dated 11 September 2006 (**Exhibit J-073**).\n\nEmail from Mr Guzman to Mr Gupta, dated 17 October 2006 (**Exhibit J-076**). Mr Al Tamimi's contention that in June 2008, H E Maqbool, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, represented to him that he did not need to register SFOH is not supported by any contemporaneous documentation or other evidence: First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [148].\n\n296.\n\nOn 22 August 2007, OMCO wrote to Mr Al Tamimi, in his capacity as Chairman of SFOH, indicating that it would consider the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement \" *null and void*\u00a0\" if he failed to complete the necessary documentation to register SFOH in Oman by 30 November 2007.629 Mr Al Tamimi did not do so. Six months later, on 2 June 2008, OMCO therefore purported to determine that the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement had been rendered null and void:630\n\n*Despite repeated requests from Oman Mining Company LLC (OMCO), you have failed to submit any documentation to show the Registration of SFOH LLC in the Sultanate of Oman. In particular, by our letter dated 22nd August 2007, OMCO gave* *you a deadline of 30 November 2007 to remedy this failure, failing which the agreement shall be treated as null and void.*\n\n*Since you have failed to submit the requested documentation, this notice is to reiterate as null and void the Lease Contract between OMCO and SFOH dated 25* *May 2006.*\n\n**Exhibit J-109**.\n\n**Exhibit J-182**.\n\n297.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is whether Mr Al Tamimi's failure to register SFOH in Oman had the legal effect for which OMCO, and latterly the Respondent, has contended.\n\n298.\n\nExtensive submissions were made by the parties as to whether the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement required registration of SFOH in Oman under its own contractual terms. The OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement, however, simply affirms that SFOH must comply \" *with all obligations* [\u2026] *and laws for the time being in force or any statutory modifications or re-enactment thereof* \".631 As the abovequoted passage from OMCO's letter of 2 June 2008 makes clear, OMCO did not purport to terminate the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement for breach of that agreement's contractual provisions. Rather, OMCO had determined to treat the lease as \" *null and void* \" because SFOH had failed to establish a legal presence in Oman in alleged breach of Oman's statutory company laws. Thus the relevant question is more fundamental: did SFOH's failure to register in Oman render that company, as well as the lease agreement into which it entered with OMCO, null and void as a matter of Omani law?\n\n**Exhibit J-058**, Art 8(iii).\n\n299.\n\nThe Commercial Companies Law (\" **CCL** \") of Oman provides for the legal regulation of companies in Oman in six different forms, including limited liability companies.632 Article 2 of the CCL provides that a company is \" *null and void* \" unless it \" *adopts one of the types listed* \".633 Article 136 of the CCL confirms the mandatory requirement to register a limited liability company in Oman: the owners of a limited liability company \" *shall register the limited liability company in the Commercial Register pursuant to the law* \".634 Article 140(c) of the CCL provides that a \" *limited liability company shall not be deemed finally constituted* \" until \" *[r]egistration of the company in the Commercial Register* \" has occurred.635\n\nOman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, The Commercial Companies Law, No 4/1974, Art 2 (**RLA-052**). The six different forms are: General Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, Joint Ventures, Joint Stock Companies, Limited Liabilit[y] Companies and Holding Companies.\n\n**RLA-052**, Art 2.\n\n**RLA-052**, Art 136.\n\n**RLA-052**, Art 140(c).\n\n300.\n\nRegistration in the Commercial Register is thus clearly central to the existence of a company's separate legal personality under Omani law. Additionally, Article 4 of the CCL provides that \" *[a]ll* *contracts, receipts, notices and other documents issued by commercial companies shall indicate the company's name, its form, its principal place of business*  ***and the number and place of its registration in the Commercial Register*** \".636 Similarly, Article 9 of the Commercial Register Law (\" **CRL** \") stipulates that \" *[a]ny commercial company whose main center of operations is located in Oman must be registered in the Commercial Register of the region where such center is situated* \".637\n\n**RLA-052**, Art 5 (emphasis added).\n\nCommercial Register Law, No 3/74, Art 9 (**RLA-049**).\n\n301.\n\nIt is clear from the above provisions, especially when they are considered together, that in order to have a legal presence in Oman - including the ability to conduct business and enter into contracts as a legal entity - a limited liability company must be registered in the Omani Commercial Register.\n\n302.\n\nIn addition to these requirements, foreign investors wishing to conduct business in Oman are subject to the Foreign Capital Investments Law (\" **FCIL** \").638 Under the FCIL, non-Omanis (whether natural or juridical persons) may not conduct a \" *commercial, industrial or tourism* \" business in Oman unless they first obtain a license from MOCI.639 The same requirement, indeed, applies under the CRL: Article 3 of the Commercial Register Law Amendment (\" **CRLA** \") requires that \" *any natural or legal person* \" must obtain a \" *license from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry* \" before \" *exercising commerce in the Sultanate* \".640\n\nSee eg **RLA-052**, Art 7 (\" *Commercial companies with non-Omani partners, whether such partners are natural or juristic persons, shall comply with the foreign capital investment law* \").\n\nForeign Capital Investment Law, Art 1 (**CLA-049**).\n\nAmendments Made in the Commercial Register Law No 3/74, Art 3 (**RLA-048**).\n\n303.\n\nIn order for a non-Omani to obtain a license to operate under the FCIL, Article 2 first requires that the proposed business must be \" c*onducted by an Omani company with a capital of not less than RO 150,000* \", of which the foreign shareholding may be no more than 49% (or up to 65%, with the approval of the Foreign Capital Investment Committee and MOCI).641 An annex to the FCIL, entitled \" *Instruction for Establishment of Omani Companies Subject to Commercial Companies Law and Foreign Business and Investment Law* \" sets out the process for incorporation of an Omani company to satisfy the requirements of Article 2 of the FCIL, including obtaining a certificate from the Omani Commercial Register, preparing the company's articles of association, and establishing a corporate capital of no less than RO 150,000.642\n\n**CLA-049**, Art 2.\n\n**CLA-049** at 14.\n\n304.\n\nAgain, reading these legal requirements together, it is clear to the Tribunal that Omani law requires that any \" *commercial, industrial or tourism*\u00a0\" business conducted in Oman must be carried out by a local company registered in the Commercial Register.\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimant, however, has submitted that SFOH was not subject to these requirements because it was not \" *conduct[ing] any commercial, industrial or tourism business in Oman*\u00a0\".643 Under the terms of the Joint Production Agreement executed between Emrock and SFOH on 15 January 2007, the Claimant says, SFOH carried out no mining activities but merely held a real property lease.644 The Respondent, in return, has argued that SFOH cannot rely on a private contract such as the Joint Production Agreement to circumvent registration requirements imposed by domestic law.645\n\nClaimant's Reply at [113].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [114]. See **Exhibit J-087**.\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [277].\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that SFOH was not exempt from the registration requirement merely because Emrock and SFOH agreed under the Joint Production Agreement that Emrock would be responsible for day-to-day quarrying and crushing operations at the quarry site. The CRL contains a list of relevant \" *business activities*\u00a0\" which includes \" *[o]il, gas and mineral resources investment*\u00a0\".646 The terms of both the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement and the Joint Production Agreement reveal that the carrying out of such activities was precisely SFOH's purpose.647 Under the terms of the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement, SFOH committed to \" *contribute any or all investment in the plant, equipment and working capital necessary to establish and maintain the quarrying and crushing operation, as appropriately reviewed by both parties, particularly in regard to the periodic production schedule*\u00a0\", as well as being \" *responsible for the day-to-day technical and financial management and administration of the project*\u00a0\".648\n\n**RLA-049**, Art 5(11).\n\nOne might also consider that pursuant to the SFOH Memorandum of Association dated 15 May 2006, it was stated that \" *the objects for which the Company is established are to engage in general trading* \u2019, although the company was prohibited from carrying out business with persons in the UAE: see **Exhibit J-054**, Art 4.\n\n**Exhibit J-058**, Art 5.\n\n307.\n\nSimilarly, the Joint Production Agreement provided that Emrock and SFOH would \" *establish a business relation* [\u2026] *the principal objectives of which shall be the Quarrying of Natural Stone, sale and distribution of products*\u00a0\".649 In that role, SFOH agreed with Emrock to secure all necessary permits and approvals for quarrying and crushing, provide necessary materials such as diesel and explosives, and obtain visas and working permits.650 SFOH additionally undertook to \" *prepare the* *site* \", including the provision of explosives storage (with necessary permits), diesel and water storage tanks, a power generator, a graded and paved road from the quarry to the main road, and a mobile camp for 100 residents with kitchen, dining area and bathrooms.651 SFOH also assumed a monthly obligation under the Joint Production Agreement to pay Emrock for tonnage of material shipped out of the quarry (as well as 70% of stockpiled material if less than an average of 25,000 MT was picked up every month).652\n\n**Exhibit J-087** at 2.\n\n**Exhibit J-087**, Art 5.\n\n**Exhibit J-087**, Arts 5 and 8.\n\n**Exhibit J-087**, Art 5. In his Memorial, the Claimant also stated that \" *[f]or accounting purposes, Mr Al Tamimi expected to treat sales to Nakheel as coming from Emrock and sales to all other customers as coming from SFOH* \": Claimant's Memorial at fn 101.\n\n308.\n\nThat SFOH would be directly involved in the Claimant's quarrying operations at Jebel Wasa was also the position represented externally to the Omani authorities. In its AEP submitted to MECA, for example, SFOH had stated that \" *SFOH will operate its own quarry and share crushing and other infrastructure with Emrock LLC* [...] *Each Company will produce 15 million tonne per annum (mpta) limestone product for a combined total of 30 mpta* \".653\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to MRMEWR, dated 3 November 2006, attaching the Application for Environmental Permit (**Exhibit J-077**).\n\n309.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant's submission that SFOH \" *act[ed] only through Emrock* \".654 Rather, as a matter of law and practice, SFOH was intended to operate in Oman in its own right. As a non-Omani entity conducting business in Oman, SFOH was required to register on the Commercial Registry of Oman and obtain a license from MOCI. Indeed, it appears that at one point the Claimant held the intention of doing just that: in the AEP submitted by SFOH to MECA, when asked for SFOH's commercial or industrial registration number, the application stated \" *[c]ommercial registration applied for and pending* \".655 Mr Van der Wiele of GEO-Resources, who assisted with preparing the AEP, gave evidence that \" *Mr Al Tamimi informed me that he would in fact be registering SFOH in Oman. It is for this reason that we later provided a statement to that effect in our draft Application for Environmental Permit* \".656\n\nClaimant's Reply at [114].\n\n**Exhibit J-077** at 3.\n\nFirst Van der Wiele Witness Statement at [18].\n\n310.\n\nWhat, then, was the legal consequence of SFOH's failure to do register in Oman? The Claimant has submitted that the \" *legal consequence for such a failure would have been a small fine* \", and not the nullification of the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement, correctly noting that under Art 17 of the FCIL, the penalty for conducting business without a license is a fine of no less than RO 5,000 and no more than RO 10,000.657 However, as a matter of Omani law the consequences of SFOH's failure to register clearly run deeper. The provisions of the CCL cited above indicate that a company has no legal presence in Oman unless registered. Article 2 of the CCL, it will be recalled, provides that a company is \" *null and void* \u2019 unless it \" *adopts one of the types listed* \u2019.658 Article 4 of the CCL, moreover, provides that \" *[a]ll contracts, receipts, notices and other documents issued by commercial companies shall indicate the company's name, its form, its principal place of business and the number and place of its registration in the Commercial Register*\u00a0\".659 The Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that the effect of Article 4 is to \" *requir[e] an Omani registration number to meet the threshold requirement of having a legal presence in the jurisdiction. Accordingly, registration is a condition precedent for any agreement entered into by the company to become effective*\u00a0\".660\n\nClaimant's Reply at [284]; **CLA-049**, Art 17.\n\n**RLA-052**, Art 2.\n\n**RLA-052**, Art 4.\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [272].\n\n311.\n\nWithout legal personality, SFOH had no capacity to enter into contracts such as the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement. The Tribunal therefore finds that OMCO was entitled to treat the lease agreement as null and void owing to SFOH's failure to register and obtain a business license in Oman. This consequence finds additional support in the wording of the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement: Article 2 provides that the lease agreement would only commence and come into effect \" *upon* [\u2026] *the issuance of*  ***all relevant licenses*** *, permits and approvals from the relevant authority at the Sultanate of Oman*\u00a0\".661 There is no evidence that OMCO \" *acquiesced*\u00a0\" in SFOH's non-registration, as the Claimant has contended.662\n\n**Exhibit J-058**, Art 2 (emphasis added).\n\nClaimant's Reply at [121].\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that it has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement.\n\n**(iii) Physical infrastructure and equipment**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimant has also referred to other physical assets (mining infrastructure and equipment) as constituting part of his investment. Those physical assets remained at the quarry site after 1 January 2009, as permitted under the extant OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, therefore, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over that investment.\n\n**B. ATTRIBUTION**\n------------------\n\n**(a) Attribution of OMCO's conduct**\n-------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimant has, as set out above, submitted that the actions of OMCO can be attributed to the Respondent for the purposes of State responsibility under the US-Oman FTA. Investment protection under Chapter 10 of the US-Oman FTA, of course, applies only to \" *measures adopted or maintained* ***by a Party*** \".663 Attribution of OMCO's conduct is therefore necessary for the Claimant to claim against the Respondent in respect of OMCO's purported termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement in February 2009.664\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.1 (emphasis added).\n\nAttribution would also, of course, be relevant to the nullification of the OMOC-SFOH Lease Agreement, but this lease need not be discussed further in light of the Tribunal's finding as to jurisdiction *ratione temporis* above.\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimant has effectively made a two-fold argument as to attribution. He has argued:665 (a) that OMCO is an organ of the Omani State by virtue of its being a governmental company exercising \" *governmental authority* \" under Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA; and/or (b) that OMCO acted pursuant to the directions of MECA in terminating the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, relying on Emrock's alleged non-payment of overdue fines as mere \" *pretext* \" to conceal a politically-motivated decision.666\n\nSee eg Claimant's Reply at [206]-[218].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [208].\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the actions of OMCO are not attributable to the Respondent. Simply put, OMCO does not meet the test under the US-Oman FTA for attribution. There is no evidence that in making the decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, OMCO was exercising, or indeed would have been authorised to exercise, any regulatory, administrative or governmental authority. There is, furthermore, no evidence that OMCO acted under direction from MECA, and the Tribunal is not satisfied in any event that this would meet the narrow test for attribution under the US-Oman FTA. The Tribunal elaborates on each of these points below.\n\n**(i) Attribution under the US-Oman FTA**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThere is no dispute that OMCO is a state-owned enterprise. Indeed, OMCO was expressly established as such in 1981 pursuant to Royal Decree 11/81.667 To that end, 99% of the shares in OMCO are owned by the Omani Ministry of Oil and Minerals,668 its directors are appointed by royal decree,669 and its board of directors has included current and former ministers in the Omani government.670\n\n**CLA-002**.\n\nArticles of Association of Oman Mining Company, Art 6 (**Exhibit J-378**). The remaining 1% is held by the Oman Development Bank.\n\n**Exhibit J-378**, Art 12.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, OMCO's board of directors from 2005-2008 included directors from MOCI, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Oil and Gas, the Ministry of National Economy and the Oman Development Bank: Memorial at [26]. Mr Al Waily also gave evidence that \" *a senior MOCI official customarily serves as the chairman of OMCO's Board of Directors* \": First Al Waily Witness Statement at [9].\n\n318.\n\nHowever, Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA sets out a relatively narrow test for the circumstances under which the actions of a state enterprise may be attributed to the State:671\n\n*A Party's obligations under this Section shall apply to a state enterprise or other person*  ***when it exercises any regulatory, administrative, or other governmental authority delegated to it by that Party*** *.*\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.1.2 (emphasis added).\n\n319.\n\nFor the purpose of attribution under the US-Oman FTA, therefore, the fact that OMCO is a state enterprise is insufficient. To be attributable to the Respondent, OMCO's conduct must occur in the exercise of \" *regulatory, administrative, or other governmental authority delegated to it* \" by Oman.\n\n320.\n\nThis test under Article 10.1.2 may be narrower in some respects than the test for State responsibility under customary international law - as described, for example, in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (\" **ILC Articles** \"), which set out a number of grounds on which attribution may be based. The ILC Articles suggest that responsibility may be imputed to a State where the conduct of a person or entity is closely directed or controlled by the State,672 although the parameters of imputability on this basis remain the subject of debate.673\n\n**CLA-005**, Art 8.\n\nDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries, United Nations, 2008 at 47-48 (**CLA-081**) (\" *Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5.* \")\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that contracting parties to a treaty may, by specific provision (*lex specialis*), limit the circumstances under which the acts of an entity will be attributed to the State.674 To the extent that the parties have elected to do so, any broader principles of State responsibility under customary international law or as represented in the ILC Articles cannot be directly relevant.\n\nSee eg *United Parcel Service of America Inc v Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award and Separate Statement, 24 May 2007, at [59], [62], for a similar analysis in relation to the similarly drafted provisions in NAFTA, Chapter 15 (**RLA-046**).\n\n322.\n\nThe effect of Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA is to limit Oman's responsibility for the acts of a state enterprise such as OMCO to the extent that: (a) the state enterprise must act in the exercise of \" *regulatory, administrative or governmental authority* \"; and (b) that authority must have been delegated to it by the State.675 The Respondent is therefore correct in its submission that, whether or not the Ministry of Oil and Minerals exercised \" *effective control* \" over OMCO through its 99% shareholding, or through influence over its directors or managers, as the Claimant submits,676 this is not relevant to the test for attribution under Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA.677\n\nThis is significantly narrower than the several grounds of attribution provided under the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility, which also include situations where, for instance, the relevant entity merely acts under the control or direction of the State: see **RLA-065** at 101.\n\nSee eg Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 4. The Tribunal does not find, in any event, that the Claimant's submissions that \" *[t]he Commerce Ministry vetoed OMCO's first attempt to terminate its contracts with Mr Al Tamimi* \" and that the second termination required formal approval from MOCI itself (Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 42, 44) is adequately supported by the evidence. Rather, it appears largely to have been Mr Al Tamimi who attempted to arrange for MOCI to intervene in OMCO's termination decision. Indeed, a letter from Dr Al Azri to Mr Al Tamimi dated 27 July 2008, after the issuing of the first termination notice, stated that \" *[w]e would remind you again, Emrock had a contract with Oman Mining Company and not with any other authority in the Sultanate of Oman* \": **Exhibit J-202**. Even the letter sent from H E Al Dheeb to Dr Al Azri dated 10 August 2008, on which the Claimant places significant reliance, stated only that the Ministry was \" *of the view* \" that the Lease Agreement should not be terminated, provided the agreement was reviewed by the relevant ministries: **Exhibit J-204**. The only recorded formal approval of the second termination notice came from the OMCO Board: Revised Minutes of Board of Directors Meeting Held on 14 February 2009, Meeting No 01/2009, at 3 (**Exhibit J-307**).\n\nThe Claimant has also suggested that OMCO might be considered not as a state enterprise but as a state organ. It is clear to the Tribunal, however, for the same reasons set out below in discussing OMCO's lack of \" *regulatory, administrative or governmental authority* \", that OMCO is not an organ of the Omani State.\n\n323.\n\nThe US-Oman FTA does not define what is meant by \" *regulatory, administrative or governmental authority* \". The Respondent has submitted, however, that in this respect the \" *requirement for attribution in the FTA closely parallels that in Article 5 of the ILC Articles* \".678 Under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, a person or entity which is not an organ of the State must be empowered by the law of that State to \" *exercise elements of the governmental authority* \" and must act \" *in that capacity in the particular instance* \".679 The conduct at issue must be \" *governmental* \" or sovereign in nature (*acta jura imperii*). Purely commercial conduct (*acta jure gestionis*) cannot be attributed to the State under Article 5.680\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [302].\n\n**RLA-065** at 100. The latter requirement is also imposed under Art 10.1.2 through use of the word \" *when* \".\n\n**RLA-065** at 101. See also *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No ARB/97/7), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000 at [89] (**RLA-027**); *Jan De Nul NV and Dredging International NV v Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No ARB/04/13), Award, 6 November 2008 at [165]-[173] (**RLA-024**). Crawford in his Commentary provides instructive examples of the possible exercise of governmental powers by a private or state-owned entity: private security firms, for instance, which exercise delegated powers in the operation of a prison, or a private or state-owned airline which exercises delegated powers in relation to immigration or quarantine: **RLA-065**, at 100.\n\n324.\n\nGiven the specific test laid out by the State parties under Article 10.1.2, the criteria of Article 5 of the ILC Articles are not directly applicable to the present case. Indeed, there may be points of divergence between the test under Article 5 and the test under Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA: Article 10.1.2 refers to the exercise of \" *regulatory* \" and \" *administrative* \" authority in addition to \" *governmental* \" authority.681 But Article 5 nevertheless provides a useful guide as to the dividing line between sovereign and commercial acts.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find it necessary in this instance to determine what, if any, is the relevant distinction to be drawn between \" *governmental* \" and \" *regulatory* \" or \" *administrative* \" powers, because it is clear that OMCO exercised none of these types of powers.\n\n325.\n\nThere is, quite simply, no evidence that OMCO exercised any delegated \" *regulatory, administrative* *or governmental authority* \" in any of its dealings with Emrock, much less in its decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. The Claimant has emphasised that OMCO's board of directors comprised ministers from various governmental departments, placing particular emphasis on the dual role of Dr Hilal Al Azri as both Director-General of Minerals for MOCI and Chairman of OMCO's Board of Directors.682 Yet the mere fact that a number of OMCO's board members also served as government ministers does not by itself demonstrate that OMCO exercised regulatory, administrative or governmental powers, or that the ministers sitting on OMCO's board exercised any such powers when sitting in their capacity as directors of OMCO *.*683\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [25]-[26].\n\nCrawford in his Commentary emphasises that what matters is not whether governmental powers were exercised generally, but whether they were exercised in the relevant instance: it is not enough, for example, that a railway company has been delegated certain police powers by the State if the impugned conduct involves only the commercial sale of tickets or the purchase of rolling-stock: **RLA-065** at 101.\n\n326.\n\nMost significantly, the Claimant has been unable to identify any relevant law that specifically delegates any regulatory, administrative or governmental authority or powers to OMCO. As previously noted, OMCO came into existence in 1981 pursuant to Royal Decree 11/81. That decree makes expressly clear that OMCO was established simply as a \" *limited liability company* \" under the CCL, exercising ordinary commercial powers.684 The Royal Decree delegates no regulatory, administrative or governmental powers to OMCO.\n\n**CLA-002**, Art 3.\n\n327.\n\nPursuant to Article 16 of OMCO's bylaws, moreover, OMCO's board of directors is empowered to act only as necessary \" *to implement the company goals* \", with its powers restricted by law and the company's Agreement of Association.685 OMCO's \" *company goals* \" are set out at Article 5 of the Agreement of Association (and repeated in Article 5 of the bylaws). They too contain nothing to suggest that OMCO is intended or empowered to conduct any regulatory, administrative or governmental functions. Rather, OMCO's company purposes are limited to:686\n\na. \" *exploration and drilling for minerals* [\u2026] *excavating mines and establishing all equipments* [sic] *required for operating same and for collecting and fusing the produced raw materials* \";\n\nb. \" *[m]arketing produced raw materials* \"; and\n\nc. \" *[m]anufacturing raw materials and marketing manufactured materials* \".\n\nSee **Exhibit J-378**, Art 16.\n\n**Exhibit J-378**, Art 5.\n\n328.\n\nIn his Memorial, the Claimant acknowledged that \" *OMCO was established to search for minerals, construct and drill mines for the collection and production of minerals, and marketing and manufacturing of minerals* \", without reference to the exercise of any regulatory, administrative or governmental authority.687 Rather, the Claimant recognised in his Memorial that other organs of the Omani State exercised administrative and regulatory control over his investment:\n\na. \" *[m]ining activities of OMCO are controlled, monitored and licensed by the Ministry of Commerce* \";688\n\nb. \" *Oman's Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs* [\u2026] *enforces Oman's laws* *pertaining to the environment and pollution controls* \" and is \" *responsible for issuing certain permits a quarry operator must have in order to excavate and process limestone* \";689 and\n\nc. \" *the Ministry of Housing has the power to record all land rights and grant land ownership rights* \" and is \" *responsible for zoning lands in Oman for residential, commercial and industrial uses* \".690\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [25].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [31].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [32].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [33].\n\n329.\n\nThat it was indeed these Omani ministries, rather than OMCO, which exercised the relevant regulatory, administrative or governmental powers is fully supported by the record of evidence. The OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, for instance, described OMCO simply as a \" *State-owned company which has been awarded mining concession[s] in the Jebel Wasa in the Sultanate of Oman by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry* \", one of which concessions it intended to \" *demis[e]* \" to Emrock.691 The agreement did not grant the Claimant any regulatory or administrative approval to operate the quarry: rather, the agreement expressly contemplated that it would only \" *come* [into] *effect upon* [...] *the issuance of all relevant license, permits and approvals*  ***from the relevant*** ***authority at the Sultanate of Oman*** \".692\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Preamble.\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 2 (emphasis added).\n\n330.\n\nIt is apparent from this wording that the parties understood that OMCO itself exercised no regulatory authority to grant licenses, permits or approvals. Those powers resided with the relevant authorities of the Omani government, and the record shows that OMCO itself was subject to their application. OMCO committed under the lease agreement only to using its \" *best endeavours in obtaining of the necessary environmental and operating permits* \", conditioned on Emrock's operational and environmental management plans meeting the \" *satisfaction of the relevant authorities* \".693 It was, of course, to these relevant Omani authorities that the parties subsequently turned in order to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Arts 4, 7.\n\n331.\n\nThere is no evidence that OMCO ever acted, or purported to act, during the relevant period in any capacity other than as commercial lessor of the quarry concessions which had been awarded to it by the Omani government. When concerns were raised about Emrock's compliance with Omani law in conducting its quarrying activities, it was not OMCO but MECA and MOCI which issued regulatory warnings and later imposed fines. That these warnings were issued by MECA and MOCI to OMCO, and the fines paid by OMCO in the first instance, provides further evidence of the arm's-length regulatory relationship which existed between OMCO and the relevant Omani authorities. The Claimant's repeated claims that it was OMCO's obligation to pay the fines imposed by the relevant Omani ministries is also inconsistent with his argument that Oman had delegated \" *regulatory, administrative or governmental authority* \" to OMCO in respect of the operations at the Jebel Wasa quarry site.\n\n332.\n\nFinally, and most significantly, the evidence relating to OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement - the specific conduct which forms the basis of Mr Al Tamimi's claim under the US-Oman FTA - equally discloses no evidence that OMCO was acting, or purporting to act, in the exercise of any regulatory, administrative or governmental authority. In the second termination notice, sent on 17 February 2009 from OMCO to Mr Al Tamimi in his capacity as Chairman of Emrock,694 OMCO did not purport to invoke or rely upon any regulatory, governmental or administrative authority to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. Rather, it expressly relied on its perceived contractual entitlement under Article 10(iv) to terminate the agreement on the basis of Emrock's non-compliance with payment obligations. OMCO observed in the termination notice that Mr Al Tamimi was \" *well aware of this provision* \" and that \" *we are always having to chase you for payments* [\u2026] *this situation is intolerable* \".695\n\nIt will be recalled that the Tribunal has found that events before 1 January 2009, such as the first termination notice, do not fall within the scope of its jurisdiction under the US-Oman FTA.\n\n**Exhibit J-250**. The termination notice further set out a variety of additional alleged breaches by Emrock -persistence in illegal activity, failure to meet a 35% Omanisation requirement, failure to rent all equipment from Omani sources, failure to maintain third-party insurance, failure to give timely information about limestone production and sales figures, and failure to provide verifiable data regarding *wadi* material extracted and sold -although it is not expressly clear from the text of the letter whether OMCO relied upon these additional grounds of breach alternatively (or cumulatively) in terminating the lease.\n\n333.\n\nAs the Respondent has submitted, the terms of OMCO's second termination notice make it plain that \" *OMCO was acting like any other commercial party, enforcing its view of its contractual rights pursuant to a negotiated private agreement* \".696 OMCO did not purport to - and nor could it -terminate the lease agreement in exercise of any extra-contractual regulatory, administrative or governmental powers. The Tribunal finds that OMCO's conduct in terminating the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was nothing more than what it was expressed to be: a commercial response to Emrock's alleged various and repeated breaches of contract.\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [317].\n\n334.\n\nIn short, there is no evidence that OMCO ever acted in the exercise of any regulatory, administrative or governmental authority delegated to it by the Omani State. The lease agreement into which it entered with Emrock was a simple commercial lease. The parties acknowledged in that agreement that OMCO would use its \" *best endeavors* \" to obtain the necessary permits from the authorities. It was those same relevant governmental authorities which responded when concerns arose regarding Emrock's compliance with the regulatory approval Emrock had been granted. OMCO's role was, at most, to act as a commercial intermediary between Emrock and the Omani authorities exercising relevant governmental authority. The termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement is entirely consistent with this understanding of OMCO's role. OMCO did not seek to rely on any sovereign power to terminate the lease agreement, but only its express contractual rights. The fact that OMCO was a State-owned entity does not suffice.\n\n335.\n\nIt follows that OMCO's conduct does not meet the test for attribution to Oman under Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA.\n\n**(ii) Influence of MECA**\n--------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimant has additionally submitted, effectively in the alternative, that OMCO's conduct should nevertheless be attributed to the State because OMCO was influenced or pressured by MECA to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.697\n\nSee eg Claimant's Reply at [208]-[212].\n\n337.\n\nThe difficulty with this argument is that the relevant test under Article 10.1.2 effectively precludes such a basis for attribution. It is conceivable that the Ministry's alleged conduct, if proven, might support a case for indirect expropriation of the OMCO-Em rock Lease Agreement, based on the Ministry's ***own*** conduct as an organ of the Omani State. But in light of the requirements of Article 10.1.2, the Tribunal does not consider that mere pressure from MECA would be a sufficient basis for attributing OMCO's otherwise entirely commercial conduct as a state enterprise to the Omani State.\n\n338.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidential basis to support the contention that MECA exercised any influence over the decision made by OMCO to terminate its lease with Emrock. The Claimant has not been able to produce any hard evidence to show that MECA so much as suggested in advance to OMCO that it should terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. There is no evidence to support the Claimant's suggestion that OMCO's decision to terminate on the basis of non-payment of fines was merely \" *pre-textual* \", intended to conceal some manner of broader political scheme into which OMCO had been coerced by MECA. As already noted, the evidence shows OMCO's decision to issue the second termination notice of 17 February 2009 to have been a purely commercial one, driven by OMCO's frustration with an \" *intolerable* \" situation in which it was \" *always having to chase* [the Claimant] *for payments* \".698\n\n**Exhibit J-250**.\n\n339.\n\nThe letter of 3 May 2009 sent from OMCO's lawyers, Trowers & Hamlins, to Mr Al Muharrami of MECA, relied upon by the Claimant, discloses no evidence of any ministerial pressure.699 The letter, coming roughly three months after OMCO's second termination notice of 17 February 2009, simply updated the Ministry regarding OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Em rock Lease Agreement and requested that the criminal charges brought against OMCO and Mr Al Waily be withdrawn, on the basis that OMCO was \" *not responsible for Emrock's crimes* \".700 Those charges were not filed by MECA until March 2009, after the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement had been terminated. Thus the Claimant's submission that MECA used this prosecution as a means of \" *putting pressure on OMCO* *to force Emrock and SFOH out of business and out of Oman all together* [sic]\", and that OMCO terminated the lease agreement in order \" *to placate Mr Al Muharrami of the Environmental Ministry in the hopes of ending the prosecution of Mr Al Waily* \", is implausible.701 The timing of events simply does not support an inference that the Ministry sought to use its authority to bring criminal charges against OMCO in order to influence the latter's commercial decision-making.\n\n**Exhibit J-285**.\n\n**Exhibit J-285** at 3. The letter further noted that OMCO had \" *written numerous times to Emrock demanding it desist from the illegal activities* \" and that \" *Emrock should be the party prosecuted for the environmental violations as it is the party that is trespassing into the wadi and illegally mining there* \".\n\nClaimant's Reply at [209]-[210].\n\n340.\n\nIn respect of the citations and fines issued by MECA against OMCO prior to the second termination notice,702 the Tribunal finds there is no evidence that these citations were issued other than in good faith and pursuant to Omani law. The citations were issued in furtherance of the Ministry's role to regulate and supervise compliance with Oman's environmental laws, as well as the terms of the environmental permits that MECA had previously issued to OMCO/Emrock.703 There is no evidence that MECA sought to use these powers for any political or sovereign purpose in order to pressure OMCO into terminating its relationship with Emrock. The citations issued by MECA did not seek to compel OMCO's termination of the lease agreement - rather, on their express terms, they sought only to bring Emrock's quarrying operations into regulatory compliance.704\n\nThe Claimant has cited, for instance, **Exhibit J-115**, **Exhibit J-218**, **Exhibit J-257**, Infraction Report, dated 7 February 2009 (**Exhibit J-242**) and Infraction Report, dated 11 February 2009 (**Exhibit J-245**): see Claimant's Reply at [209].\n\nOf relevance here is Art 10.10 of the US-Oman FTA, which provides that \" *[n]othing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner* *sensitive to environmental concerns* \". Also of indirect significance is Chapter 17 of the US-Oman FTA on \" *Environment* \", Art 17.2.1 of which, for instance, provides that \" *[n]either Party shall fail to effectively enforce its* *environmental laws, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade* *between the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement* \". These provisions are discussed in more detail in the Tribunal's analysis of the Claimant's minimum standard of treatment claim below.\n\n**Exhibit J-258** ; **Exhibit J-259**.\n\n341.\n\nIn summary, even if the Tribunal were to find that it constituted a separate ground for attribution under the US-Oman FTA, the Claimant's suggestion that OMCO was pressured by MECA (or any other organ of the Omani government) to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement simply finds no support in the evidence.\n\n342.\n\nIt follows that there is no basis on which OMCO's conduct in respect of the Claimant and his investments may be attributed to the Respondent.\n\n**(b) Attribution of other Omani entities**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nIn addition to his claim in respect of the conduct of OMCO, the Claimant has also submitted that the relevant conduct of other entities within Oman - namely (a) MECA; (b) MOCI; (c) MOH; (d) the Omani Public Prosecutor; and (e) the Royal Oman Police - may also be attributed to Oman.705\n\nClaimant's Reply at [206].\n\n344.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal confirms that the relevant actions of these entities may be attributed to the Respondent. There is no question that State organs such as government ministries and the State police force operate as arms of the State, and indeed - unlike OMCO - such entities are characterised by their exercise of \" *regulatory, administrative or governmental* \" authority. Although State responsibility for the conduct of State organs is not directly expressed in the text of the US-Oman FTA, the attribution of such conduct to the State is broadly supported in international law.706\n\nSee eg Art 4 of the ILC Articles: **CLA-081** at 40.\n\n**C. BREACH**\n-------------\n\n**(a) Expropriation**\n---------------------\n\n**(i) Expropriation under the US-Oman FTA**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nExpropriation is addressed by Article 10.6.1 of the US-Oman FTA. That article provides that:\n\n*1. Neither Party may expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization* *(\"expropriation\"), except:*\n\n*(a) for a public purpose;*\n\n*(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;*\n\n*(c) on payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and*\n\n*(d) in accordance with due process of law and Article 10.5.1 through 10.5.3.*\n\n346.\n\nOf further significance is Annex 10-B to the US-Oman FTA. By virtue of footnote 2 to the title of Article 10.6 (\" *Expropriation and Compensation* \"), the Tribunal is required to apply Annexes 10-A and 10-B when interpreting Article 10.6.707 Annex 10-B reads as follows:\n\n***ANNEX 10-B***\n\n***EXPROPRIATION***\n\n*The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:*\n\n*1. Article 10.6.1 is intended to reflect customary international law concerning the obligation of States with respect to expropriation.*\n\n*2. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.*\n\n*3. Article 10.6.1 addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.*\n\n*4. The second situation addressed by Article 10.6.1 is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.*\n\n*(a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:*\n\n*(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;*\n\n*(ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and*\n\n*(iii) the character of the government action.*\n\n*(b) Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.*\n\nFn 2 states in mandatory terms: \" *Article 10.6 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annexes 10-A and 10-B*.\" Annex 10-A states: \" *The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \u2018customary international law' generally and* *as specifically referenced in Article 10.5 and Annex 10-B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens*.\" See further discussion on Annex 10-A in the context of the Claimant's minimum standard of treatment claim at [378ff] below.\n\n347.\n\nAccordingly, the first question for the Tribunal must be whether an expropriation has occurred, either directly (as defined in Annex 10-B.3) or indirectly (as defined in Annex 10-B.4). If the Tribunal is satisfied that a direct or indirect expropriation has occurred, it must determine whether the expropriation is lawful according to the four listed criteria under Article 10.6. The four criteria for a lawful expropriation are, of course, conjunctive rather than disjunctive: that is, all four criteria must be satisfied before an expropriation may be co nsidered lawful.\n\n**(ii) Alleged expropriation of the Claimant's investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted that the unlawful expropriation of his investment took place through a series of measures carried out by the Respondent which ultimately \" *culminated* \" in the expropriation of his entire investment on 23 May 2009.708\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [172].\n\n349.\n\nIn this manner, the Claimant has effectively framed his expropriation claim as a species of creeping indirect expropriation of the kind defined in Annex 10-B.4 of the US-Oman FTA. Relying on the analysis of the Tribunal in *AIG v Kazakhstan*,709 the Claimant has submitted that Oman's continued interference with the use of his property had the \" *effect of depriving* [him] *in whole or in significant part of the use or reasonably to be expected benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the Host State* \".710 The result, the Claimant has submitted, is that \" *Oman, through OMCO and other instrumentalities of the Omani government, has plainly and completely deprived Mr Al Tamimi of his investment in the Quarry* \",711 and rendered him \" *unable to exercise any of the mining or leasehold rights he had acquired and invested in so heavily* \".712\n\n*AIG Capital Partners Inc and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/6), Award, 7 October 2003 (**CLA-051**).\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [48].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [181].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [183].\n\n350.\n\nThe measures said by the Claimant, individually and cumulatively, to have constituted the expropriation of his investment are:713\n\na. Termination of the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements;\n\nb. The arrest of Mr Al Tamimi;\n\nc. The police coercion of Mr Al Tamimi to sign an undertaking to refrain from further production at the Jebel Wasa quarry;\n\nd. The prosecution of Mr Al Tamimi; and\n\ne. The forced dispersal by the police of Mr Al Tamimi's workforce and physical assets.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [179], [182].\n\nPrimary investment: the right to operate at Jebel Wasa\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nNotwithstanding that the Claimant has framed his case for expropriation as a series of cumulative or creeping measures by the Respondent which deprived him of his property rights, it is clear that the central element of the expropriation claim is the termination of the OMCO-SFOH and OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreements.714 That must be so, because the Claimant's investment right - that is, the right to operate a limestone quarry in Oman - derived directly from his companies' ownership of, respectively, the OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreement and the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. Indeed, the Claimant has acknowledged that *\"the termination of the Emrock Lease Agreement* [...] *by itself would have destroyed Mr Al Tamimi's investment* \".715\n\nSee Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 70: \" *[t]he property interest that Oman expropriated was Mr Al Tamimi's right to conduct quarrying operations at the OMCO concession site* \".\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [184].\n\n352.\n\nIn respect of the former agreement, the Tribunal has found that it has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis*. The lease agreement had ceased to exist before the entry into force of the US-Oman FTA on 1 January 2009. In respect of the latter agreement, the Tribunal has found that the conduct of OMCO, including its commercial decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 17 February 2009, cannot be attributed to the Respondent. OMCO did not exercise the necessary regulatory, administrative or governmental authority for its actions to be considered those of the Omani State.716\n\nOMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was confirmed in a letter from OMCO's lawyers, Trowers & Hamlins, to Mr Al Tamimi's lawyers, Said Al Shary Law Office, on 29 April 2009 (**Exhibit J-283**).\n\n353.\n\nWhether, therefore, OMCO's decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was legally justified, or indeed proportionate, under the terms of the contract is not a dispute relating to a \" *measur[e] adopted or maintained by a Party* \" cognizable under Chapter 10 of the US-Oman FTA, nor indeed \" *an action* [\u2026] *by a Party* \" within the meaning of Article 10.6.1 as interpreted by Annex 10-B.4. The legality of OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement must be resolved as a matter of private contractual law, not public international law.717 The Tribunal observes in this respect that under Article 11 of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, entitled \" *Applicable Law and Jurisdiction* \", the parties agreed to submit any irreconcilable dispute regarding \" *any aspect of the contractual relationship* \" to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Omani Arbitration Centre, whereby three arbitrators would determine the dispute pursuant to the Omani arbitration rules.718 The Tribunal must be concerned only with the fact that OMCO terminated the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 17 February 2009 - which the Tribunal finds that it did.719\n\nSee *Impregilo SpA v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/3), Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005 at [260] (**RLA-023**): \" *In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the BIT, it must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority ('puissance publique'), and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligation assumed under the BIT* \". In the present case, of course, the Tribunal has found that the acts of OMCO cannot be attributed to the Omani State at all.\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 11. The Claimant has acknowledged that \" *the Tribunal is not empowered to make an award based solely on breach of contract* \": Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 61.\n\nSee [292] above.\n\n354.\n\nIt follows that the Claimant's claim under international law for expropriation of his primary investment in Oman - the right to operate a limestone quarry at the Jebel Wasa quarry site - must fail. The Claimant's investment was lost not as the result of a sovereign expropriation, but as the result of a contractual dispute with a private commercial actor.720. In the language of Annex 10-B.2, there can be no expropriation because there has been no relevant action or series of actions by Oman which interfered with a tangible or intangible property right at Jebel Wasa. Any alleged action taken by Oman ***after*** the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 17 February 2009 (the alleged conduct listed at (b)-(e) in [350] above) cannot have interfered with the Claimant's right to mine because with the termination of the lease any such property right ceased to exist. The Claimant's expropriation claim must therefore fail.\n\nIn this respect, the present case is different from *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Ecuador* (\" *Occidental II* \") (**CLA-038**) cited by the Claimant: see Claimant's Memorial at [186]-[187]. In *Occidental II*, the conduct in question was a sovereign act (the issuing of a \" *Caducidad* Decree\") carried out by Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Mines, an organ of the State, independent from the breach of contract: see [418].\n\n*Decision of the Ibri Court of Appeal*\n--------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that OMCO's second termination of 17 February 2009 did not have the effect of terminating the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, and that it was the Respondent's further conduct (as listed at (b)-(f) in [350] above) which caused the loss of his investment.721 In support of this claim, the Claimant has referred many times to the decision of the Ibri Court of Appeal of 6 June 2010, which acquitted Mr Al Tamimi of the two misdemeanour criminal charges on which he had previously been convicted by the Mahda Court of First Instance.722 The Claimant says that the decision of the Ibri Court of Appeal compels the conclusion that OMCO did not in fact terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement in February 2009.723\n\nSee eg Claimant's Memorial at [179ff]; Reply at [141ff]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 62 (\" *In addition, of course, Claimant has pled and proven violations of the FTA by other organs of the Omani government, including the prosecutors, the Environmental Ministry and the Commerce Ministry* \").\n\nIt will be recalled that the decision of the Ibri Court of Appeal related only to an appeal against the first relevant decision of the Mahda Court of First Instance, rendered on 8 November 2009, which found Mr Al Tamimi guilty of two misdemeanour criminal charges. The separate, second decision of the Mahda Court of First Instance, rendered on 25 April 2010, which found Mr Al Tamimi liable on four additional charges filed by MECA, was not the subject of appeal to the Ibri Court of Appeal: see [78]-[80] above.\n\nSee eg Claimant's Reply at [20ff]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [44]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 54.\n\n356.\n\nThe logic of this argument is somewhat difficult to sustain. If the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's argument that the Ibri Court of Appeal decision shows that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was still on foot in June 2010, then it is difficult to understand how a case for expropriation could be made out, given that the Claimant's property rights would thus have been preserved (unless, perhaps, the Claimant was in practice prevented from exercising those property rights by Oman's conduct).724\n\nThe submissions of the Claimant have been unclear on this point. In his Post-Hearing Answers, the Claimant said only that the judgment of the Ibri Court of Appeal showed that the Lease Agreement was \" *still in full force and effect,*  ***at least as of the date of his arrest*** \": Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 54 (emphasis added).\n\n357.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's submission that the Ibri Court of Appeal decision shows that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement remained on foot after 17 February 2009.\n\n358.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal does not accept that the doctrine of *res judicata* (or indeed any form of \" *collateral estoppel* \" defence) has any application to these proceedings on the specific issues relevant to the alleged breaches. An international tribunal is generally not bound by the decision of any local court as to the determination of a dispute under international law.725 A local court decision which rules directly on a matter - such as the validity of the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement - might, of course, provide more or less compelling evidence as to the existence of a relevant fact or domestic state of affairs. But it does not have the \" *preclusive effect* \" contended for by the Claimant.726\n\nSee eg *Urbaser SA and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/07/26), Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 December 2012 at [191] (\" *a decision rendered by a domestic court has no res judicata effect on an arbitral tribunal notwithstanding compliance with the test that would otherwise cause res judicata effect to attach under the domestic law of the Host State* \") (**RLA-085**); *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No ARB/97/7), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction at [29] (\" *the international tribunal rather than the domestic court has the final say on the meaning and scope of the international obligations\u2014in this case the BIT\u2014that are in dispute* \") (**RLA-027**). See also *Robert Azinian*, *Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/97/2), Award, 1 November 1999 at [86] (\" *it would be unfortunate if potential claimants under NAFTA were dissuaded from seeking relief under domestic law from national courts, because such actions might have the salutary effect of resolving the dispute without resorting to investor-state arbitration* [\u2026]\") (**RLA-003**).\n\nSee Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 4. Whether, as the Claimant has submitted (see Claimant's Reply at [20ff]), the conduct of the Ibri Court of Appeal as a State organ is attributable to the State is, in the Tribunal's view, an entirely different question from whether this Tribunal is bound by that Court's findings of fact.\n\n359.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal finds that the termination or otherwise of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement has not been determined as a matter of local Omani law, because: (a) the Ibri Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in its criminal jurisdiction, whereas the lease agreement granted exclusive jurisdiction over the determination of all aspects of the contractual relationship to the Omani Arbitration Centre (which jurisdiction has not been exercised); (b) under Omani law a penal judgment has binding effect on civil courts only insofar as it relates to \" *the occurrence of the offence, its legal description and its attribution to the offender\",* not the incidental determination of any matters of civil law;727 and (c) the Ibri Court of Appeal in any event made no direct finding as to validity of OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.728 Indeed, the judgment of the Ibri Court of Appeal did not refer to OMCO's first or second termination notices at all. OMCO and Emrock - the two parties to the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement - were not parties to Mr Al Tamimi's criminal trial. In short, the Court of Appeal judgment overturned Mr Al Tamimi's prior conviction as a matter of Omani criminal law, but it did not deal with the key issues in dispute in this proceeding.\n\nThe local case authority cited by the Claimant in this respect indicates only that a criminal acquittal may act as a shield under Omani law against later accusation of wrongdoing on the same grounds as were \" *necessary* \" or indispensable to the original acquittal: see Sultanate of Oman Commercial Court, Collection of Legal Rules Decided by the Court in its Thirteenth Judicial Year (1996) at 304 (**CLA-058**); Sultanate of Oman Authority for Commercial Disputes Settlement, Collection of Legal Rules Decided by the Authority in Judicial Year 11 (1994\u20141995) at 437 (**CLA-056**); Sultanate of Oman Commercial Court, Compilation on Legal Rules Decided by the Court in its Fifteenth Judicial Year (1998-1999) at 349 (**CLA-052**).\n\nThe Penal Procedure Law, Royal Decree No 97/99, Art 280 (**RLA-060**).\n\n360.\n\nAs the Claimant has acknowledged, the Ibri Court of Appeal focused on specific questions relevant to the criminal charges, such as whether Mr Al Tamimi was a \" *thief* \" as defined, whether his activities fell within the coordinates laid down by the Oman's Ministry of Housing, and whether he had permits from OMCO to operate a crusher.729 The Court did not engage in any detail with the nature or status of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. Any *res judicata* finding based on the Claimant's exoneration by the Ibri Court of Appeal would also have to contend with the separate, second decision of the Mahda Court of First Instance of 25 April 2010 (not subject to the Ibri Court of Appeal's ruling on appeal) which found Mr Al Tamimi guilty of four substantially similar offences, and against which Mr Al Tamimi has not appealed.730\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Submissions at [27]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 27, 60-61.\n\nThat is, theft of stones and breach of Oman's environmental laws: see **Exhibit J-327**. The Claimant has submitted that this decision \" *does not warrant attention when compared to the Court of Appeal's decision* \", primarily because it was rendered *ex parte* : Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 61.\n\n361.\n\nThere is thus no basis on which the Ibri Court of Appeal can be said to have ruled OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement to be ineffective.\n\n*Requirement of a judicial decree*\n----------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Claimant has further submitted, citing the terms of Royal Decree 6/89, that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement cannot be taken to have terminated on 17 February 2009, because OMCO failed to obtain a judicial decree authorising termination of the contract.\n\n363.\n\nOnce again, the Tribunal reiterates that it does not have the jurisdiction to rule on the legality of OMCO's private commercial decision to terminate the lease agreement, especially when the Claimant has not challenged that decision according to the process stipulated by the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement itself. The Tribunal observes, however, that it seems implausible that the lease of vacant and unimproved land conveyed to the Claimant under the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement would fall within the definition of \" *dwellings and commercial and industrial premises* \" under Royal Decree 6/89.731 Thus the Tribunal does not consider that a judicial decree was required to lawfully terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement in accordance with the express termination provisions contained in the lease.732\n\n**RLA-058**, Art 1. See also Sultanate of Oman, Court of Commercial Disputes, Collection of Legal Rules Resolved by the Court During its Ninth Judicial Year (1992-1993) at 310 (\" *[T]he provisions that regulate the relationship between the landlord and tenant under Royal Decree No 6/89 apply - in line with Article 1 of these provisions -solely to lease agreements under which Lessor enables Lessee to use residential, commercial or industrial premises for a specific period in return for a fixed amount,*  ***these provisions do not apply to lease agreements pertaining to vacant lots*** *, even if these lots were earmarked for industrial purposes, or the purpose of the lease agreement was to establish residential, commercial or industrial facilities* [\u2026] *[W]hat is important is the situation of the leased lot when the agreement was made, and it is the situation that was considered by the contracting parties at the time of concluding the agreement* \") (emphasis added) (**CLA-057**).\n\nAgain, see **CLA-057** at 311 (stating that under the general rules governing lease agreements in Oman, \" *[t]he Court may accept or reject the request of Lessor* [to terminate a lease] ***unless there is an explicit provision in the agreement that automatically terminates the agreement without the need for a notice or court judgment***  *in case Lessee breaches its obligation to pay the rent* \") (emphasis added).\n\n364.\n\nIn any event, all that matters for present proceedings is that the Tribunal is satisfied that the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was terminated by OMCO, in accordance with its express termination provisions, on 17 February 2009.\n\n*Post-termination measures*\n---------------------------\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that it is not fatal to his expropriation claim that termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement is not attributable to the Respondent, because his claim covers a series of expropriatory measures engaged in by the Respondent that individually and collectively deprived the Claimant of his investment. However, it is plain from the list set out at [350] above that the additional constituent elements of the Claimant's creeping expropriation claim occurred after the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 17 February 2009. Any measures taken by Oman that allegedly affected the Claimant's ability to operate at the Jebel Wasa quarry site after that date - the arrest of Mr Al Tamimi, the alleged coerced undertaking to cease operations at the quarry site, the subsequent prosecution of Mr Al Tamimi, the alleged police harassment of Emrock employees at the quarry site - can in practice have had no expropriatory effect on the Claimant's already-defunct investment. After 17 February 2009, the Claimant simply had no \" *covered investment* \" for the purposes of Chapter 10 (except, perhaps, for some physical infrastructure and equipment remaining at the quarry site, to be considered further below).733\n\nUnder cross-examination, expert Mr Michael Wick, called by the Claimant, acknowledged that \" *[i]f the lease is invalid, there's absolutely no value* \": Transcript, Day 7 at 137:16-17 (Wick).\n\n366.\n\nFor instance, the Claimant has submitted that \" *[t]he Omani police effectively ejected Claimant from the quarry* site\" on 23 May 2009 (the date of his arrest and the date on which he fixes the culmination of the Respondent's expropriation) and \" *required him to shut down his production of limestone* \".734 The Claimant has alleged that the police subsequently prevented Emrock employees from carrying out operations at the quarry site, and progressively forced Emrock to leave the site entirely.735 Yet by that time any right to carry out operations at Jebel Wasa previously held by the Claimant had ceased to exist. The Claimant's submission that the undertaking allegedly coerced from him by the Royal Oman Police during his brief detention forced him to surrender his investment rights in return for his release from jail is similarly unavailing, because by that time the Claimant had no rights in respect of the Jebel Wasa quarry left to surrender. The Claimant has submitted that \" *Oman has not* *even begun to articulate a plausible justification for shutting down Mr Al Tamimi's quarry* \".736 However, in the Tribunal's view the answer is very plain: to the extent that the police did enforce the closure of the Claimant's quarry (of which there is no direct evidence), the \" *plausible justification* \" was that Mr Al Tamimi no longer possessed any legal right to operate at Jebel Wasa.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [142], [145]. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 5.\n\nClaimant's Reply at [147]-[148].\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 3.\n\n367.\n\nBy the same measure, whether or not the prosecution of Mr Al Tamimi was fair or justified in the circumstances - questions to be considered in greater depth in the Tribunal's analysis of the minimum standard of treatment claim below - it is clear that it did not constitute or contribute to the loss of the Claimant's right to operate at the Jebel Wasa quarry, and accordingly did not permanently deprive the Claimant of any property rights. Even if Mr Al Tamimi had retained a covered investment at the time of his arrest or prosecution, it would be difficult to understand the basis on which he has alleged that he was permanently enjoined from operating at Jebel Wasa as a result of that arrest and/or prosecution. Mr Al Tamimi was immediately granted bail after his arrest.737 Even the three-month sentence of imprisonment later imposed by the Mahda Court of First Instance in its judgment of 8 November 2009 was imposed as a suspended sentence (and ultimately lifted on acquittal).738 The Respondent is correct to observe that these events did nothing to prevent Mr Al Tamimi from pursuing a contractual claim against OMCO if he believed that his rights in respect of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement had been wrongfully terminated.739\n\nMr Al Tamimi has also acknowledged that the Public Prosecutor returned his passport to him at the request of his lawyers a few weeks after his arrest, permitting him to travel freely: First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [191].\n\nSee **Exhibit J-327**.\n\nIndeed, it appears from the evidence that the Claimant may have taken initial steps to pursue this avenue of redress: on 27 May 2009 Mr Al Tamimi's lawyers at Said Al Shary Law Office gave formal notice to OMCO that it was referring seven listed disputes to arbitration, including \" *the purported termination of the Agreement by OMCO* \": Letter from Said Al Shary Law Office to Trowers & Hamlins, dated 27 May 2009 (**Exhibit J-303**). In that letter, the Claimant recognised that \" *[i]n clause 11, the parties agreed to submit all disputes, if not resolved, to arbitration in Oman and under the laws of Oman* \". A further letter was sent on behalf of Emrock by another legal counsel on 26 July 2009, rejecting OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement and appointing a local arbitrator on behalf of Emrock: Letter from Mohammed Al Murtadha & Co to Mr. Al Waily, dated 26 July 2009 (**Exhibit J-314**). It appears, however, that Mr Al Tamimi/Emrock took no subsequent steps to pursue that arbitration. For this reason, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant's contention that \" *the actions of the Omani police that resulted in the shutdown of the quarry without affording Mr Al Tamimi an opportunity to contest the validity of the termination constituted an additional violation of the FTA's requirements* \": Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 4-5.\n\n368.\n\nIn short, the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimant's case largely puts matters into reverse perspective. While the Claimant has submitted that the Respondent's actions after 17 February 2009 constituted measures that led to the loss of his investment rights, in truth it was the Claimant's persistence in operating at Jebel Wasa after the loss of those investment rights that led to the actions of which he now complains. After 17 February 2009, the Claimant had no primary investment capable of being expropriated. Any claim for indirect expropriation based on the Respondent's actions after 17 February 2009 would also have to confront the express stipulation in Annex 10-B.4(b) of the US-Oman FTA that non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a State designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, including protection of the environment - and, the Tribunal infers, the enforcement of Omani private property laws - do not constitute indirect expropriations.\n\n369.\n\nIt follows that the Claimant has not established a claim against Oman for expropriation of his primary investment.\n\nVestigial investment: infrastructure and equipment\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nFor completeness, the Tribunal has also considered whether the evidence discloses any potential claim of direct or indirect expropriation in respect of Respondent's treatment of the physical infrastructure and equipment which remained at the Jebel Wasa quarry site after the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on February 17, 2009. The Claimant has alleged that the Royal Oman Police permitted the looting and destruction of Emrock's infrastructure and equipment at the Jebel Wasa quarry site, thereby \" *ensur[ing] that Emrock would not be able to return the quarry to operation* \".740\n\nSee eg Claimant's Memorial at [179]; Claimant's Reply at [150]-[156] (\" *By these actions, Oman rendered Claimant completely unable to resume the work that it had wrongfully ordered him to cease*.\")\n\n371.\n\nThe immediate difficulty for such a claim is that the Claimant possessed no legal right to retain property or staff at the quarry site, nor indeed to remain on the site himself, without the property rights formerly bestowed by the Lease Agreements.741 On 17 February 2009, the same date that OMCO sent its second termination notice, OMCO also issued Mr Al Tamimi with a \" *demobilization plan* \", requiring OMCO to remove all \" *equipment, installations and accommodations* \" within two weeks, and one further week to tidy the site before handover back to OMCO.742 When Emrock did not vacate the site as instructed, OMCO sent repeated letters to Mr Al Tamimi observing that his continued presence at the site was \" *illegal* \" and demanding that Emrock cease operations and remove equipment as required. The Claimant's apparent response to this series of increasingly frustrated letters from OMCO - such as OMCO's letters dated 3 March 2009,743 15 March 2009,744 18 March 2009745 and 19 April 2009746 - was simply to defy OMCO's instructions.\n\nNotwithstanding this fact, it appears that Mr Al Tamimi continued to operate at the quarry site until his arrest on 23 May 2009, and indeed Emrock continued to sell surplus limestone inventory from the site for months even after Mr Al Tamimi's arrest: see Ralutin Witness Statement at [24], [31]; First Gupta Witness Statement at [69]; Second Gupta Witness Statement at [22]-[23] (\" *we continued to liquidate our stockpile of previously quarried limestone materials, which had already been sold to our customers under supply contacts* [\u2026] *it took about six months to liquidate the stockpile* \"). See also Letter from Mr Al Tamimi to Nakheel, dated 9 December 2009 (**Exhibit J-329**); Quotation for Limestone Material from Emrock to Mr Ali Bilal, dated 15 June 2010 (**Boyd Exhibit 9-20**). A letter from OMCO's lawyers, Trowers & Hamlin, to MECA dated 7 November 2010 suggests that even as late as October 2010 an Emrock employee remained on site selling limestone (**Exhibit J-357**).\n\n**Exhibit J-249**.\n\n**Exhibit J-257**.\n\n**Exhibit J-266**.\n\n**Exhibit J-268**.\n\n**Exhibit J-277**.\n\n372.\n\nIn that context, it is unsurprising that the Royal Oman Police took steps after February 2009 to enforce demobilisation of the Claimant's operations at the Jebel Wasa quarry site. The Claimant's submission that the actions of the police after February 2009 had the effect of ending operations at the quarry and ultimately forcing Emrock to abandon the quarry site is entirely consistent with the Respondent's exercise of its police powers to act against those who by this time must in law have been trespassers.747 Mr Ralutin's account, for example, that the police repeatedly showed up at the quarry site after February 2009 to remind Mr Al Tamimi and his staff \" *that they were not allowed to be operating at all* \" simply discloses, in the Tribunal's view, an accurate understanding by the police of the prevailing legal situation.748\n\nSee eg UNCTAD, Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II, \"Expropriation: A Sequel\" (2012) at 79 (\" *According to the doctrine of police powers, certain acts of States are not subject to compensation under the international law of expropriation.* [...] *For example, if confiscation of property is effected as a sanction for a violation of domestic law by the property owner, this would not be an expropriation. The same would be the case if an establishment is shut down for violations of environmental or health regulations* \") (**RLA-063**).\n\nRalutin Witness Statement at [33].\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimant has alleged that as a result of Emrock being forced to abandon the quarry site, \" *Emrock's buildings were vandalized and looted, and its business records at the site were lost or destroyed* \" and that \" *the police allowed local residents to come in and take what they wanted* \".749 There is no evidence, however, that the Royal Oman Police seized, permitted to be seized, or otherwise expropriated any physical property from the Jebel Wasa quarry site. Indeed, the evidence presented by the Claimant as to the fate of the vestigial infrastructure and equipment at the quarry site has been ambiguous at best. While in his Reply the Claimant alleged that the Omani police \" *allow[ed] Emrock's infrastructure and equipment to be looted and destroyed* \",750 in his earlier Memorial the Claimant acknowledged that after termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, \" *Mr Al Tamimi was left with only inventory that either had already been sold or that had to be sold, and very expensive quarrying equipment that was quickly sold off or repossessed by and for creditors* \".751 Similarly, Mr Gupta gave evidence that he understood that infrastructure such as the tank and pumps at the site were in fact dismantled and removed by Shell Oil Company pursuant to that company's agreement with Emrock.752\n\nClaimant's Reply at [155].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [150].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [184]. See also Claimant's Memorial at [139] (\" *As a result of the termination of quarrying operations, Emrock was not able to generate the revenue necessary to pay creditors, and creditors in turn seized the equipment remaining at the Quarry site* \").\n\nFirst Gupta Witness Statement at [74].\n\n374.\n\nAs to the vandalism which the Claimant says did occur at the quarry site, after Emrock and its employees had permanently left the site, the evidence is even more insubstantial.753 The Claimant, for example, has submitted that Emrock's scale bridge was \" *removed from its foundation and carted* *away* \",754 but has presented as evidence only a photo showing its absence, without any additional evidence as to who took it, or when, or why.755 Similarly, the Claimant's submission that its business records were destroyed is supported only by Mr Ralutin's witness statement that he \" *heard* \" that this had occurred - \" *after Emrock had abandoned* [the quarry site]\".756\n\nClaimant's Reply at [155].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [155].\n\nPhotograph of the Scale House without Weighbridge (**Exhibit J-390**). See also Ralutin Witness Statement at [28] (even after May 2009, \" *customers were still coming onto the site with their own trucks to pick up orders for limestone that had already been pre-sold. At first, the number of trucks coming through to pick up their orders was not affected by the fact that we had stopped operations.* \").\n\nRalutin Witness Statement at [37].\n\n375.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to show that Oman expropriated any of the Claimant's physical infrastructure or equipment at the Jebel Wasa quarry. Despite the Claimant having no legal right to remain at the quarry site, the Royal Oman Police permitted Mr Al Tamimi and his equipment to remain on the site for many months after the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement - and indeed apparently permitted Emrock for a time to sell off its surplus inventory.757 That the Claimant was forced to carry out a private sale of inventory and equipment as a result of the demise of his commercial venture, and forced to allow repossession of certain equipment by creditors, does not disclose any relevant State conduct which might amount to an expropriation.\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [151].\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that no expropriation under Article 10.6.1 of the US-Oman FTA has been established. The Claimant is unable to elevate a private contractual dispute with OMCO into an expropriation under international law. Any State conduct taking place after 17 February 2009 cannot have had any effect on the Claimant's primary investment, which after that date had ceased to exist. There is no evidence that the Respondent's actions expropriated any of the vestigial infrastructure or equipment which remained on the property after that date. Taking into account Article 10.6.1 and Annex 10-B.2, the evidence discloses no conduct attributable to the State which deprived the Claimant of the value of his investment. The Tribunal accordingly dismisses this claim.\n\n**(b) Minimum standard of treatment**\n-------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimant's second claim of breach against the Respondent alleges that the Respondent failed to treat the Claimant's investment according to the minimum standard of treatment imposed by Article 10.5 of the US-Oman FTA. Article 10.5 provides that:\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\n\n*2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered* *investors. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or* *beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights.*\n\n378.\n\nAs with Article 10.6, the title of Article 10.5, \" *Minimum Standard of Treatment* \", contains a footnote which mandates the Tribunal to interpret the article in accordance with an annex, namely Annex 10-A. Annex 10-A further clarifies the meaning of \" *customary international law* \" for the purposes of the US-Oman FTA:\n\n***ANNEX 10-A***\n\n***CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW***\n\n*The parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\"* *generally and as specifically referenced in Article 10.5 and Annex 10-B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect economic rights and interests of aliens.*\n\n379.\n\nAlso of relevance to the present claim is Article 10.10 of the US-Oman FTA, which provides as follows:758\n\n*Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.*\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.10.\n\n**(i) Content of the minimum standard**\n---------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nThe parties accept that the minimum standard of treatment under the US-Oman FTA refers to the customary international law standard and not an autonomous treaty standard.759 That conclusion is compelled by Article 10.5.2, which expressly provides that the Treaty's standards of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security \" *do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by* [the minimum standard of treatment]\".760\n\nSee eg Claimant's Response to US Submission at [7].\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.5.2.\n\n381.\n\nThe precise standard of treatment requirement by the minimum standard, however, became a significant point of contention between the parties during proceedings. It also received the attention of a State party submission from the United States Government pursuant to Article 10.19.2 of the US-Oman FTA, which provision authorises the non-disputing State party to make submissions regarding the interpretation of the Agreement.761 Thus the Tribunal considers that a brief discussion of the scope of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law is warranted before it considers the standard's application in the present circumstances.\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.19.2. The US Submission was accepted by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 12, dated 14 October 2014. As the Respondent has noted, a tribunal is not bound by the views expressed in such a non-disputing Party submission, but may give them persuasive weight where appropriate.\n\nMinimum standard principles\n---------------------------\n\n382.\n\nIt is broadly accepted that the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law imposes a relatively high bar for breach. In *SD Myers v Canada*, for instance, a NAFTA/UNCITRAL decision, the tribunal said that a finding that the minimum standard has been breached \" *must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders* \".762 A strict \" *minimum standard of treatment* \" provision such as Article 10.5, particularly when considered in the light of Annex 10-A in the present case, cannot be interpreted in the expansive fashion in which some autonomous fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security provisions of other treaties have been interpreted. Indeed, the language of Article 10.5.2 makes very clear that Article 10.5 does \" *not require treatment in addition to or beyond* \" that required by the minimum standard of the treatment of aliens under customary international law.\n\n*SD Myers, Inc v Canada* (NAFTA/UNCITRAL), First Partial Award, 13 November 2000 at [263] (**RLA-039**).\n\n383.\n\nThe traditional customary law standard for the minimum treatment of foreign persons was that set out in the *Neer* decision, in which it was said that \" *the treatment of an alien* [\u2026] *should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far* *short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency* \".763 Although a number of subsequent arbitral decisions have acknowledged that with the passage of time the standard has likely advanced beyond these basic requirements,764 tribunals have continued to employ descriptions which emphasise the high threshold for breach. As was noted by the tribunal in *Glamis Gold* (which invoked *Neer*), the customary international law minimum standard of treatment sets only a ***minimum*** standard: \" *It is meant to serve as a floor, an absolute bottom, below which conduct is not accepted by the international community* \".765 Customary international law applies to all States and across the whole spectrum of international circumstances: the minimum standard of treatment must be understood in this context only as the conduct expected of all States as a bare, invariable minimum.\n\n*L F H Neer and Pauline Neer v United Mexican States*, 4 Reports of International Arbitral Awards (15 October 1926) at 61-62.\n\nSee Claimant's Reply, fn 291, in which the Claimant references the *Mondev* and *ADF* tribunals' support for the argument that the minimum standard is no longer \" *confined to the outrageous treatment referred to in the Neer case* \": *Waste Management, Inc v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/00/3), Award, 30 April 2004 at [93] (**CLA-022**).\n\n**RLA-021** at [615]. The tribunal discussed *Neer* 's relevance at different points in its award: see [21]-[22] and [60ff].\n\n384.\n\nBreach of the minimum standard of treatment thus requires more than a minor derogation from the ideal standard of perfectly fair and equitable treatment. The Claimant, for instance, has cited the description of the minimum standard from *Waste Management II*, endorsing its description of the relevant standard.766 In that case, the minimum standard was said to require \" *arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic* \" conduct by a State party, or a \" *complete lack of transparency and candour* \", or \" *a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings* \".767 As other tribunals have noted, adjectives such as \" *gross* \" and \" *manifest* \" indicate the acknowledged stringency of the standard.768\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial at [202]-[204]; Claimant's Reply Memorial at [175]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [50].\n\n**CLA-022** at [98].\n\nSee **R-021** at [617].\n\n385.\n\nOther Tribunals have confirmed a similar standard. In *International Thunderbird*, for instance, it was said that:769\n\n*Notwithstanding the evolution of customary law* [\u2026] *the threshold for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment still remains high, as illustrated by recent international jurisprudence* [\u2026] *For the purposes of the present case, the Tribunal views acts that would give rise to a breach of the minimum standard of* *treatment* [...] *as those that, weighed against the given factual context, amount to* *a*  ***gross denial of justice or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable standards*** *.*\n\nCited in Oman's Counter-Memorial at [370] (emphasis added).\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's contention,770 citing *Tecmed v Mexico*, that the standard will be breached merely if a State fails to act \" *in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor* \".771 That standard may be consistent with an \" *autonomous* \" treaty standard for fair and equitable treatment, which was the relevant standard before the Tribunal in *Tecmed*.772 The minimum standard of treatment in customary international law, to which Article 10.5 is expressly linked by virtue of Article 10.5.2, as well as Annex 10-A, imposes a higher threshold for breach.773 The language of Article 10.5.2 makes it very clear that the State Parties intended to impose only the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. Whether other treaties impose a different standard of requisite treatment is not the concern of the present Tribunal. The same logic applies to the Claimant's reliance on the *MTD v Chile* and *Metalclad* decisions.774\n\nSee eg Claimant's Memorial at [201].\n\n*Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/00/2), Award, 29 May 2003 at [154] (**CLA-021**).\n\n**CLA-021** at [152] and [155] (\" *the scope of the undertaking of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4(1) of the Agreement described* [...] *is that resulting from an autonomous interpretation* [\u2026]\").\n\nSee eg **RLA-021** and *Cargill v Mexico* (cited by US Submission at [6]). To the extent necessary, the Tribunal disagrees with the finding of the Tribunal in *Biwater Gauff* that the autonomous fair and equitable (\" **FET** \") standard and the minimum standard of treatment are \" *not materially different* \": **RLA-004** at [592], [602].\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/7), Award, 25 May 2004 (**CLA-023**); Metalclad Corporation v United Mexican States (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, 30 August 2000 (**CLA-018**). The latter award predated the NAFTA Free Trade Commission's 31 July 2001 Note of Interpretation, which clarified that NAFTA's minimum standard of treatment provision applied the customary international law standard. As already discussed, Art 10.5 of the US-Oman FTA applicable in the instant case expressly incorporates the customary international law standard.\n\n387.\n\nMoreover, as already noted, the US-Oman FTA places a high premium on environmental protection.775 It is uncontroversial that general principles of customary international law must be applied in the context of the express provisions of the Treaty. In the present case, Article 10.10 expressly qualifies the construction of the other provisions of Chapter 10, including Article 10.5. The wording of Article 10.10 provides a forceful protection of the right of either State Party to adopt, maintain or enforce any measure to ensure that investment is \" *undertaken in a manner sensitive to* *environmental concerns* \", provided it is not otherwise inconsistent with the express provisions of Chapter 10.\n\nSee Respondent's Post-Hearing Answers at 54 (\" *In entering into the FTA Oman emphasized the importance of environmental protection, providing in Chapter 17 (Environment) that each State Party should \"encourage high levels of environmental protection\" within their respective territories. In so doing, the US and Oman are among the very few countries that have declared in a very concrete way their intention to balance the protections afforded to investors with the rights of States (here Oman and the US) to enact regulations protecting the environment* \") (citation omitted).\n\n388.\n\nMoreover, Chapter 17 of the US-Oman FTA entitled \" *Environment* \", although it does not fall directly within the Tribunal's jurisdiction, provides further relevant context in which the provisions of Chapter 10 must be interpreted.776 Article 17.2.1, for instance, records the Parties' understanding that:\n\n*(a) Neither Party shall fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.*\n\n*(b) The Parties recognize that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other environmental matters determined to have higher priority. Accordingly, the Parties understand that a Party is in compliance with subparagraph (a) where a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources.*\n\nBoth parties agreed that Chapter 17 provided relevant interpretive context for the Tribunal in considering and applying the provisions of Chapter 10: see Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 67, Respondent's Post-Hearing Answers at 54-55. Their view is consistent with Art 10.21, \" *Governing Law* \", which states in relevant part that: \" *the* *tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international* *law* \". Thus, while the Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to determining an alleged breach of those obligations specified in Art 10.15, \" *Submission of a Claim to Arbitration* \", and no other provisions of the Agreement, the Tribunal must, in interpreting and applying the provisions of Chapter 10, read them in the context and purpose of the Agreement as a whole (cf **CLA-001**, Art 31).\n\n389.\n\nThe very existence of Chapter 17 exemplifies the importance attached by the US and Oman to the enforcement of their respective environmental laws. It is clear that the State Parties intended to reserve a significant margin of discretion to themselves in the application and enforcement of their respective environmental laws - indeed, Article 17.2.1 compels each State to ensure the effective enforcement of environmental laws.777 Article 17.2.1(b), moreover, acknowledges that environmental law enforcement is not inherently consistent in its application.778 The Tribunal in *SD Myers v Canada* acknowledged that tribunals \" *do not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government* *decision-making* \",779 and this must particularly be the case in light of the express terms of the present Treaty relating to environmental enforcement. When it comes to determining any breach of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5, the Tribunal must be guided by the forceful defence of environmental regulation and protection provided in the express language of the Treaty.\n\nSee also the Preamble to the US-Oman FTA, which includes as one of the Treaty's objectives the desire to \" *strengthen the development and enforcement of environmental laws and policies, promote sustainable development, and implement this Agreement in a manner consistent with the objectives of environmental protection* *and conservation* \": a further clear indication by the State parties that the Treaty is to be interpreted to give effect to the objectives of environmental protection and conservation.\n\nIt will be clear that this issue is also of relevant to the Claimant's national treatment claim, considered further below.\n\n**RLA-039** at [261].\n\n390.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, therefore, to establish a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5, the Claimant must show that Oman has acted with a gross or flagrant disregard for the basic principles of fairness, consistency, even-handedness, due process, or natural justice expected by and of all States under customary international law. Such a standard requires more than that the Claimant point to some inconsistency or inadequacy in Oman's regulation of its internal affairs: a breach of the minimum standard requires a failure, wilful or otherwise egregious, to protect a foreign investor's basic rights and expectations. It will certainly not be the case that every minor misapplication of a State's laws or regulations will meet that high standard. That is particularly so, in a context such as the US-Oman FTA, where the impugned conduct concerns the good-faith application or enforcement of a State's laws or regulations relating to the protection of its environment.\n\nProportionality and the minimum standard\n----------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law must be understood to include a standalone requirement of proportionality of State conduct.780 The Respondent has submitted that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate as a matter of fact that the doctrine of proportionality has become an element of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.781 This topic was also addressed by the non-disputing State party submission filed by the United States Government.782\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [174]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers, Answer B.1.\n\nSee Oman's Rejoinder at [159]-[160].\n\nSee US Submission at [9].\n\n392.\n\nThe question of the proportionality of the Respondent's conduct has been raised by the Claimant in two contexts: (a) the proportionality of OMCO's termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement; and (b) the proportionality of the conduct of the Royal Oman Police (and/or other State organs) in arresting and prosecuting Mr Al Tamimi for alleged violations of Oman's environmental laws. It will be recalled, however, that the Tribunal has found that: (a) OMCO's decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement is not attributable to the Respondent; and (b) the conduct of the Royal Oman Police (or other State organs) at the time of Mr Al Tamimi's arrest cannot have affected the Claimant's investment at Jebel Wasa, the investment by that time having ceased to exist.\n\n393.\n\nAccordingly, this is not the appropriate case for discussion of the concept of proportionality as a standalone criterion under the minimum standard of treatment. That question is better left for a case in which the issue of proportionality actually arises for determination on the facts.\n\n**(ii) Alleged breach of the minimum standard**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe Claimant has based his case for alleged breach(es) of the minimum standard of treatment on a variety of actions and events occurring between 2006 and 2009 (the Claimant, however, recognises that only measures taken or continued by Oman in 2009 can be directly relevant to his claim783). For clarity's sake, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's submissions can be effectively understood as alleging three series of measures undertaken by the Respondent:784\n\na. Oman's allegedly inconsistent, non-transparent and unfair conduct through its various regulatory agencies and instrumentalities - including but not limited to MECA, MOCI and OMCO - which began in 2006/2007 through the provision of multiple \" *conflicting coordinates* \" for the Claimant's worksite, and which continued and intensified in 2009, with the effect of impeding the operation and development of the Jebel Wasa quarry (the \" **conflicting coordinates claim** \");\n\nb. Oman's allegedly disproportionate and unfair conduct in 2009 through OMCO and other regulatory agencies and instrumentalities - including MECA and the Royal Oman Police - in forcing the Jebel Wasa quarry to cease operations entirely, including the arrest, detention and subsequent prosecution of Mr Al Tamimi, the undertaking allegedly extracted from Mr Al Tamimi not to continue work at the Jebel Wasa quarry, and the alleged harassment of Emrock's staff and their quarry site operations by the Royal Oman Police (the \" **State harassment claim** \"); and\n\nc. Oman's alleged failure to provide full protection and security at the Jebel Wasa quarry site, with the effect that much of the quarry infrastructure and equipment was allegedly vandalised, looted and destroyed, including Emrock's buildings, business records and a valuable scale bridge785 (the \" **quarry vandalism claim** \").\n\nSee eg Claimant's Memorial at [7], [208].\n\nSee eg Claimant's Memorial at [197]-[198], [207]; Claimant's Reply at [150]-[156].\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [155].\n\n395.\n\nIt bears repeating that the US-Oman FTA does not apply with retroactive effect.786 Measures taken by Oman prior to 2009, whether constituting a breach of the minimum standard or not, cannot be the subject of the Tribunal's consideration. Article 13 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility confirms that an act of State will not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs.787 The Claimant has acknowledged that \" *[w]hile Oman and its instrumentalities engaged in conduct prior to January 1, 2009 that was at times similar to that described in category one, that prior conduct (while undoubtedly a breach of Omani law) is not challenged as a breach of the FTA, which was not in force prior to that date* \".788\n\nSee [283] above.\n\n**CLA-005**, Art 13.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [208].\n\n396.\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear from the language of Article 10.1 that the Chapter 10 protections can apply in respect of measures ***maintained*** by Oman after 1 January 2009. Thus the fact that a course of conduct began prior to the entry into force of the FTA will not in itself preclude State responsibility under Chapter 10, provided the measure was maintained by the State after that date. Thus the Claimant has alleged that Oman's actions during 2006-2008 formed \" *part of a course of conduct* \" that continued into 2009.789 For this reason, the Tribunal begins below with an inspection of events occurring prior to 2009, in order to ascertain the nature of the State conduct which the Claimant alleges continued after the entry into force of the US-Oman FTA on 1 January 2009.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [7].\n\n1. Conflicting coordinates claim\n--------------------------------\n\n*Conflicting advice given: 2006-2007*\n-------------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that as early at 2006, when Mr Al Tamimi (through OMCO) first submitted an EIA to MECA, inconsistencies arose between the advice given by Oman's State organs as to the scope and location of the quarrying work permitted: \" *multiple conflicting coordinates* \", as the Claimant has described them.790 It is clear that this ongoing inconsistency as to the permissible scope of work must have left the Claimant and his companies in some considerable confusion as to the boundaries of what was allowed. For instance:\n\na. The Lease Agreements signed between OMCO (although it bears repeating that OMCO's conduct is not attributable to the State) and Emrock and SFOH in April/May 2006 conveyed a total concession area to the Claimant's companies of six square kilometres (two square kilometres to Emrock and four square kilometres to SFOH791), although a site plan attached, contemporaneously or subsequently, to the two Lease Agreements gave the impression that the total concession area constituted approximately 20 km\u00b2.792 It appears that this larger 20 km\u00b2 area was the total concession area which had earlier been requested from MOCI by OMCO.793 Although the Claimant has claimed that the parties had agreed that \" *Emrock and SFOH were not confined to any particular area within the concession area* \",794 the Claimant has also indicated that he understood that his total quarry area was limited to 6 km\u00b2: \" *it was Mr Al Tamimi's understanding that he now had rights to operate a quarry covering an area of six square kilometers within the approximately 20km\u00b2 territory that had been represented to him as OMCO's concession* \".795\n\nb. On 3 March 2007, Mr H E Al Maharrami, Director-General of Environmental Affairs at MECA, advised MOCI that MECA would authorise the quarry project in a \" *total area exploited for the mining operation* [that] *does not exceed 2 km x 2 km* \".796 The Ministry did not specify where this approved 4 km\u00b2 area would be located, but invited OMCO to contact the Ministry to supply coordinates.797\n\nc. On 5 March 2007, MOH issued a usufruct contract to OMCO, granting it the right to establish a quarry within a 14.7 km\u00b2 area. This area was defined in the site plan or plat (known locally as a \" *krooki* \") attached to the contract.798 This 14.7 km\u00b2 area represented a significant reduction from the previous 20 km\u00b2 concession area which OMCO had sought.799 This 14.7 km\u00b2 land area was also the basis on which the municipality of Mahda (the region in which the Jebel Wasa site is located) subsequently recorded its approval.800 Both the Claimant and OMCO accepted this change.801\n\nd. On 24 April 2007, MECA granted OMCO an initial environmental approval, based on the AEP and EIA previously submitted by OMCO/Emrock, for a limestone quarry covering a designated area of apparently around 2.25 km\u00b2 in total.802 That area was clearly much smaller than the total 6 km\u00b2 area that had been the subject of the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements. It was also only a small portion of the total revised concession area of 14.7 km\u00b2 granted to OMCO under the *krooki*, although the area subject to the initial environmental approval does appear to have fitted within MOH's 14.7 km\u00b2 concession area as plotted in the *krooki*. When the initial environmental approval was subsequently renewed by MECA on 15 July 2008, the coordinates remained the same.803\n\ne. On 31 May 2007, OMCO provided Mr Al Tamimi with a Quarry Agreement issued by MOCI \" *related to the area where you are working at Jebel Wasa* \", which authorised the establishment of a quarry \" *which surface area is 4 square kilometres* \".804 At the same time MOCI issued to OMCO a \" *Certificate of Quarry Operation* \",805 sometimes referred to as a quarry license, granting OMCO permission to quarry in an area defined by a set of coordinates which did not correspond to the approximately 2.25 km\u00b2 area demarcated in MECA's initial environmental approval.806 The Certificate of Quarry Operation coordinates also did not correspond precisely to the total 6 km\u00b2 area that had been the subject of the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements. Once again, the area authorised by the Certificate of Quarry Operation was only a small portion of the total revised concession area of 14.7 km\u00b2 granted by MOH to OMCO under the *krooki*, although again the area does appear to have fitted within the 14.7 km\u00b2 concession area plotted in the *krooki*.807\n\nf. As the Claimant has observed, it is clear that the area of overlap between the area defined by MOCI's Certificate of Quarry Operation and the area as defend by MECA's initial environmental approval is very small: approximately 1.63 km\u00b2.808\n\ng. Thus by mid-2007, a substantial degree of inconsistency had arisen between:\n\ni. The area of 14.7 km\u00b2 granted to OMCO by MOH under the *krooki* ;\n\nii. The area of 6 km\u00b2 granted by OMCO to Emrock and SFOH under the terms of their respective Lease Agreements;\n\niii. The area of approximately 2.25 km\u00b2 authorised for quarrying by MECA in its initial (and renewed) environmental approval;\n\niv. The area of 4 km\u00b2 authorised by MOCI in its Certificate of Quarry Operation.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [3].\n\nThere has been some controversy around which company was intended to receive which parcel of land: see eg Respondent's Post-Hearing Answers at 1-6. For present purposes, and because it ultimately makes no difference to the Tribunal's findings, the Tribunal is content to accept the language of the two Lease Agreements at face value: see **Exhibit J-048**, Art 2; **Exhibit J-058**, Art 2.\n\n**Exhibit J-048**.\n\n**Exhibit J-035**.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [15].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [51]. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 1 (\" *Mr Al Tamimi was entitled to quarry up to 6km2 anywhere within OMCO's concession area* \") and 7 (\" *[t]he mining/quarrying area set out in the Emrock and SFOH Lease Agreements was OMCO's entire concession area* \"). The Claimant's contention that he was entitled to mine anywhere inside OMCO's concession requires disregard of the \" *blocks* \" delineated in the Site Plan attached to the OMCO-Emrock and OMCO-SFOH Lease Agreements, which the Claimant has described as merely \" *vestigial* \": Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 2. The Tribunal is not persuaded that these demarcated blocks were entirely without significance. The Respondent's contention that Emrock's 4 km2 quarry area was meant to correspond to the block labelled \"Jebel Wasa-3\" is certainly plausible: Respondent's Post-Hearing Answers at 1, 4-9. But given the ambiguity surrounding this issue, including whether the Site Plans were even attached to the Lease Agreements (Mr Al Waily, for instance, in his first Witness Statement stated that the Lease Agreements \" *did not list specific coordinates delineating either OMCO's concession or the permitted lease areas in the Lease Agreements* \": First Al Waily Witness Statement at [24]; see also Transcript, Day 4 at 186:11-16 (Al Waily)), the Tribunal does not place significant weight on the demarcation of these blocks in the Site Plans.\n\n**Exhibit J-089**.The total area authorised by MECA was clear: the Tribunal rejects the Claimant's submission that \" *[b]ecause the Ministry approved the* [AEP] *without noting any need for modification, the entire concession area was approved* \" or that the \" *entire 14.7km2 area must be regarded as an additional area approved by the Environmental Ministry* \": Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 19, 28.\n\nEarlier, it seems, in response to a 2005 request from the Ministry of Commerce for environmental approval of the proposed Jebel Wasa quarry, the Ministry of Environment had indicated it would approve a quarry of only 500 m x 500m: see Letter from MRMEWR to Mr Al Azri, dated 8 March 2006 (**Exhibit J-044**). This discussion, however, was not disclosed to the Claimant: Claimant's Memorial at [43].\n\nTemplate Contract for Concession \"Usufruct\" of State-Owned Land between Oman and OMCO (**Exhibit J-090**).\n\nSee **Exhibit J-054**.\n\n**Exhibit J-100**.\n\nSee Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [16]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 8-9 (\" *Mr Al Tamimi understood the reduction had been made to accommodate local tribal leaders but that it would not interfere with his quarrying* *operations* \"). On 15 March 2008, MOH issued a second *krooki* which appears again to have shifted the coordinates of the concession somewhat, although retaining the 14.7km\u00b2 land area: Ministry of Housing Site Plan, signed 15 March 2008 (**Exhibit J-164**). It does not appear to the Tribunal that the 2008 amendment of the *krooki* had any practical effect on the parties' rights.\n\n**Exhibit J-095** ; **Claimant's Map 8**. The Claimant has suggested that the \" *coordinates* \" listed in the initial environmental approval did not sufficiently identify whether they defined the area approved for mining/quarrying: Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 28. The Tribunal does not accept this argument. It is clear that the coordinates were intended to identify the relevant permitted area. The Claimant's recognition that the coordinates \" *remained the same* \" in MECA's renewal of the permit on 15 July 2008 seems implicitly to acknowledge that these coordinates were in fact controlling: see Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 34. The fact that these coordinates did not precisely overlap with the parties' intended site for the quarry (eg the \" *Jebel Wasa-3* \" block set out in the parties' earlier Site Plan) may well be explained by the fact that no site plan appears to have been submitted to MECA along with the Claimant's AEP: see Respondent's Post-Hearing Answers at 11-12.\n\nInitial Environmental Approval: First Extension, Project No 9353, issued 15 July 2008 (**Exhibit J-196**); Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 34.\n\n**Exhibit J-103**.\n\n**Exhibit J-103**.\n\nThe Quarry License appears to have expired in May 2008 (see **Exhibit J-103**), but none of the parties seem to have noticed or done anything to address this situation: see Oman's Post-Hearing Answers at 31.\n\nSee **Claimant's Map 9**. MOCI subsequently insisted that its coordinates were the ones to be relied upon, and not those of any other agency such as MOH's *krooki* : **Exhibit J-128**.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [67].\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, on the basis of this evidence, that there is substance in the Claimant's submission that during 2006-2007 the relevant Omani authorities had seemingly proceeded \" *along parallel* *tracks, without proper coherence or coordination among government agencies and instrumentalities, and without clear and proper communication to Mr Al Tamimi* \".809 As the Claimant has submitted, Oman appears never to have given a clear explanation to Mr Al Tamimi of where the correct boundaries for the quarry site lay and why that location had been chosen.810\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [68].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [12].\n\n399.\n\nThe standard of consistency and transparency provided to the Claimant by the Respondent as to the permitted scope and location of the quarry project thus certainly left something to be desired.811 But the Tribunal is not persuaded that this conduct reaches the level of \" *manifest arbitrariness* \" or \" *complete lack of transparency and candour* \" required for a breach of the minimum standard of treatment.812 There is no evidence - aside from the Claimant's repeated assertion that the Respondent was operating under \" *pretext* \" - that MECA or MOCI acted in bad faith. It appears to the Tribunal that the Respondent's regulatory failures in this respect arose through mismanagement rather than malice.\n\nThere also appears to have been a degree of confusion about the renewal of the initial environmental permit: although the permit was renewed on 15 July 2008, on 11 October 2008 MECA issued an infraction report citing, *inter alia*, OMCO's failure to renew the preliminary approval or apply for a final approval. Again, a degree of inconsistency in State conduct is evident. The renewal dispute, however, took place in 2008, and there is no evidence that it continued after the entry into force of the US-Oman FTA on 1 January 2009.\n\n**CLA-022** at [98].\n\n400.\n\nIn any event, the primary problem is that the above-listed actions occurred prior to 1 January 2009, and thus are not directly the subject of the Tribunal's inquiry. These events could only be relevant if the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's contention that this prevailing climate of regulatory confusion was \" *maintain[ed]* \" after 1 January 2009, in that this confusion led to the series of complaints, citations and fines raised against Mr Al Tamimi and Emrock prior to and during 2009, and, perhaps, to OMCO's ultimate decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement because of Emrock's failure to reimburse the fines which had been imposed upon OMCO by MECA.\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, however, that none of the relevant events taking place after the entry into force of the US-Oman FTA on 1 January 2009 - in particular, (a) the February 2009 citations and fines imposed by MECA; and (b) the overall state of affairs which prompted OMCO to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 17 February 2009 - are, when examined closely, causatively connected with the inconsistency in the advice given by the various Omani ministries in 2006-2007 listed above.813 In other words, even if the Tribunal accepted *arguendo* that the inconsistent instructions given by the Respondent's various ministries during 2006-2007 might have constituted a breach of the minimum standard, that breach was not the reason for the damage suffered by the Claimant's investment after the FTA came into force in 2009.\n\nBecause the Claimant has framed a separate claim for breach of the minimum standard in respect of the actions of the Respondent following the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement (eg his arrest and prosecution), those alleged breaches will be treated separately below: see Claimant's Memorial at [197]-[198]. For now, it suffices to observe that the same issue of causation arises - the evidence does not disclose that the Respondent's actions caused Mr Al Tamimi any identifiable loss.\n\n402.\n\nRather, the Tribunal finds that the series of events which occurred in 2009 and caused damage to the Claimant's investment - including, of course, the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement discussed in the context of the expropriation claim above - came about largely as the result of the Claimant's own wilful refusal to comply with the clear and consistent instructions given to him by OMCO and by Oman's ministries from 2007 onwards. Most significantly, the evidence shows that the Claimant interpreted his permitting arrangements as allowing him to do something he was very clearly not permitted to do: process alluvial material from the *wadi* riverbed to the west of the Jebel Wasa mountain ridge that formed the basis of his permitted quarry site.\n\n*Dispute arises: 2007-2008*\n---------------------------\n\n403.\n\nIn his Memorial, the Claimant acknowledged that he was \" *aware* [at the time] *of some of the site coordinate discrepancies between different agencies* \", but claimed that \" *[h]is understanding, based on the Lease Agreements from April and May 2006, was that he was permitted to operate in a six square kilometre area within the larger OMCO concession area described in the site plan attached to each of the Lease Agreements* \".814 It was on this basis that the Claimant began operations at the Jebel Wasa quarry site in September 2007. Yet the Claimant must have been aware from the beginning that the regulatory approvals provided by MECA and MOCI expressly did not permit this. The approvals from those respective ministries could not simply be ignored in favour of what Mr Al Tamimi considered to be his contractual entitlement under his Lease Agreements with OMCO.815 As the Respondent has submitted, \" *[t]he area that OMCO leased to Emrock was not* [\u2026] *the area that Emrock would necessarily have the*  ***right***  *to mine* [\u2026] *the actual mining site would depend on the approvals and licenses if any later granted by the responsible ministries of the Omani government* \".816\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [68].\n\nMr Al Tamimi's evidence makes clear that he understood the need to obtain the requisite environmental approvals/permits for the conduct of operations at Jebel Wasa: see First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [52], [60], [114]. Indeed, under cross-examination Mr Al Tamimi acknowledged that his rights under the Lease Agreements were to be \" *co-extensive with the approvals that had then been granted both by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Commerce* \": Transcript, Day 2 at 80:12-17 (Al Tamimi).\n\nOman's Post-Hearing Answers at 3 (original emphasis).\n\n404.\n\nIf the regulatory approval the Claimant had obtained did not match what had been promised to him under the Lease Agreements with OMCO, then that was a contractual matter to be addressed with OMCO.817 Indeed, the evidence shows that Mr Al Tamimi met with OMCO representatives in February 2008 for that exact purpose. Following that meeting, which Mr Al Tamimi himself described as \" *heated* \",818 OMCO wrote to MOCI on 17 February 2008, requesting an expansion of the permitted area.819 OMCO wrote to MOCI again on 3 May 2008, noting that Emrock had routinely \" *exceeded the permitted area\"* in a *\"volume of trespassing \"*\u00a0attracting *\"remarks and warnings* [...] *from several authorities*\u00a0\" and again requesting an expansion of the permitted area.820 Mr Al Tamimi himself has described this application for additional permits as permits \u2018 *to cover the areas where we are operating, and to cover our wadi operations* \u2019 - thereby acknowledging that he understood that operating where he did, particularly in the *wadi* zone, was not covered by his existing permits.821\n\nFor instance, the Claimant has suggested that OMCO breached its contractual obligation under Art 4(i) to contribute the \u2018 *unrestricted* \u2019 use of its concession: Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 7. That is not a matter on which this Tribunal can rule, although the Tribunal observes that the Lease Agreements also recognise that the Claimant's right to mine would depend upon obtaining approvals and licenses from the relevant authorities of the Omani government: **Exhibit J-048**, Arts 4(ii), 5(ii). See also Transcript, Day 2 at 80:12-17 (Al Tamimi) (\u2018 *Q. Will you agree, Mr Tamimi, that your rights, commencing as of September 1st, 2007, were to be co-extensive with the approvals that had then been granted both by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Commerce? A. The answer is yes* \u2019).\n\nFirst Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [119].\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to MOCI, dated 17 February 2008 (**Exhibit J-156)**.\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to MOCI, dated 3 May 2008 (**Exhibit J-178**).\n\nFirst Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [119].\n\n405.\n\nSuch an expansion of the permitted area was never granted. Although MOCI proposed an alternative set of coordinates to \u2018 *reduc[e] the complaints* \u2019, no such expansion was ever ratified, nor approved by MECA.822 The fact that no extensions of the permitted area were ever granted did not entitle Mr Al Tamimi to proceed on the basis that they had been granted.823 Mr Al Tamimi must have known that if he proceeded to work so far outside the limits of the regulatory approval actually granted to him - notwithstanding that they may have conflicted with the terms of his contracts with OMCO -then he ran the risk of being found in regulatory breach.\n\nLetter from MOCI to Mr Al Waily, dated 13 May 2008 (**Exhibit J-179**). There is no suggestion or evidence that, as a matter of Omani law, the Respondent was obliged to issue any such permit upon request.\n\nThis point was firmly explained to Mr Al Tamimi in a letter from OMCO dated 22 April 2008: **Exhibit J-171** (\u2018 *It has* *been repeatedly explained to you that the utilization of this wadi material is not permitted by the pertinent Omani authorities, including the Ministries of Environment, Commerce & Industry, and Housing. This notwithstanding our application for operating permits in order to process the wadi materials, which have not been responded by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry* \u2019).\n\n406.\n\nThe first complaint against Emrock's activities in the Jebel Wasa, for instance, occurred in August 2007, before OMCO's declaration by letter of 22 August 2007 that the project could begin on 1 September 2007 had even come into effect.824 Indeed, the very letter of 22 August 2007 from OMCO authorising commencement of operations warned Mr Al Tamimi that Emrock was permitted by the terms of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, as well as the \" *environmental and operating permits issued by the relevant authorities in the Sultanate of Oman* \", to mine only \" *strata seams and beds of*  ***limestone*** \", and that the mining concessions were to be used \" *for the exploitation of limestone rock products only* \".825\n\n**Exhibit J-108**.\n\n**Exhibit J-108** (original emphasis). The Claimant's submission that OMCO's letter of 22 August 2007, announcing that Emrock could begin operations at the quarry site, led him to believe that he had all the necessary permits for his operations, wherever they might take place, is therefore unavailing: see Claimant's Reply at [65], [186].\n\n407.\n\nYet almost immediately, on 28 August 2007, OMCO again wrote to Mr Al Tamimi to say that it had been brought to OMCO's attention, and indeed confirmed by Mr Al Tamimi in a meeting of 23 August 2007, that Emrock was already \" *processing material originating in alluvial deposits located in the area's streams* \" - material that did not come from the primary limestone deposits contained in the Jebel Wasa seams and beds, but from the nearby *wadi* riverbed.826 OMCO observed that this action was in \" *clear violation* \" of the terms and conditions of the environmental permits as well as the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, and warned that persistence in processing alluvial stream materials would render Emrock liable for \" *fines and penalties that the governing authorities may impose on OMCO for such violations of the indicated environmental permits* \" as well as giving OMCO a right to terminate the lease agreement for substantial breach.827\n\n**Exhibit J-110**.\n\n**Exhibit J-110**.\n\n408.\n\nThe evidence shows that the Claimant understood these circumstances very well. On 1 May 2008, in a letter to Mr Gupta headed \" *STOP WADI OPERATION* \", Mr Al Tamimi wrote that:828\n\n*Please be advised that we received a notice from Oman Mining Company to stop Wadi Operation and not to remov[e] any material outside the concession area that permitted* [sic] *and you must provide the exact location for the crusher operation.* *For crushing and screening material that produce from the mountain area* [sic] *.*\n\n*In addition, you must remove all the equipment from the wadi area within the next 48 hours.*\n\n**Exhibit J-177**. See also the letter from Mr Al Tamimi to Mr Al Waily of OMCO dated 27 April 2008, in which Mr Al Tamimi acknowledged that he had ordered \" ***the stop of our wadi production*** \" while \" *waiting for the decision of the Ministry Authority for the request of the extension/permitting that has been filed by Mr Ali Al Waily* \": **Exhibit J-175** (emphasis original).\n\n409.\n\nThe references to Emrock's \" *Wadi Operation* \", concerning the removal of material from \" *outside the concession area* \", shows just how well the Claimant understood that his activities were unauthorised. The Tribunal therefore finds unconvincing the distinction now drawn by the Claimant between the \u2018 *Wadi Sumayni* \u2019 and the *\"Sayh Sumayni* \u2019.829 It is clear from the evidence that the Claimant knew at the time that any activity in the plain to the west of the Jebel Wasa mountain area, off the Jebel escarpment, was unauthorised by the terms of his permits.830 The Claimant was told on many occasions that he was not permitted under the terms of his approvals to process alluvial *wadi* material from anywhere outside his permitted quarry site.831\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [41ff]. The Claimant nevertheless acknowledges that the \u2018 *Sayh Sumayni* \u2019 he describes comprised a \u2018 *plain of limestone-based sand and gravel* \u2019, as opposed to the Jebel Wasa limestone deposit \u2018 *that was at the core of Claimant's operations* \u2019: Claimant's Reply at [47].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [19]-[31]; Second Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [66]-[68].\n\nSee [418] below.\n\n410.\n\nSimilarly, although the Claimant has argued that he believed he had obtained all necessary permits to operate crushers and screens at Jebel Wasa,832 it is again clear that what Mr Al Tamimi had no authority to do was operate crushers or screens - or indeed equipment or any nature - to process alluvial material in the *wadi* plain. This was the source of the Omani ministries' concerns, not the Claimant's operation of crushers generally.833\n\nSee eg Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 16-17. The operation of crushers was indeed referred to in the EIA approved by MECA: see GEO-Resources Consultancy, Environmental Impact Assessment V 6, dated 17 September 2006 at 24 (\u2018 *The primary and secondary crushers and product stockpiles will be developed at the foot of Jabal Wasa* \u2019) (**Exhibit J-074**).\n\nSee eg **Exhibit J-257** ; Letter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 7 October 2007 (**Exhibit J-122**); **Exhibit J-138** ; MECA Violation Photographs (**Exhibit J-244**); Transcript, Day 4 at 142:13-16 (Al Waily) (the problem with Mr Al Tamimi's operation of a crusher \u2018 *wasn't because he* [was] *operating the crusher* \u2019, but that he was \u2018 *operating the* *crusher in the wrong place* \u2019).\n\n411.\n\nThe Claimant has also attempted to place responsibility for any breaches on OMCO, arguing: (a) that it was OMCO's responsibility under the Lease Agreements to obtain all relevant approvals and permits; and (b) that OMCO failed properly to advise the Claimant as to his relevant obligations under Omani environmental law.834 The first issue, a question of compliance with a private contractual obligation, again falls under the jurisdiction of the local Omani Arbitration Centre as a dispute going to an \u2018 *aspect of the contractual relationship* \u2019 between OMCO and Emrock.835 OMCO's failure to obtain the permits sought by the Claimant, however, if indeed there was any such failure, cannot absolve the Claimant of responsibility to operate within the boundaries of the law.836\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial at [218]-[222]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 13, 38-41. The Claimant relies in this respect upon the decision in *Biloune and Marine Drive Complex v Ghana Investments Centre and Government of Ghana* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 27 October 1989 (**CLA-088**).\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 11.\n\nThe Tribunal observes in this respect that under Art 4(ii) OMCO committed only to \u2018 *use its best endeavours in obtaining of the necessary environmental and operating permits* \u2019 - a guarantee as to process, not outcome: **Exhibit J-048**, Art 4(ii).\n\n412.\n\nOn the second issue, the claim that OMCO failed to advise the Claimant is simply not sustainable in light of the evidence that the Claimant knew very well that he was not authorised to extract alluvial material from the *wadi* plain.837 Whatever the regulatory confusion caused by the inconsistent advice of Oman's ministries in 2006-2007, it is clear to the Tribunal that none of the authorisations gave Emrock permission to engage in the mining of alluvial deposits to which OMCO referred in its letter of 28 August 2007. Mr Al Waily had written to Mr Al Tamimi as early as 22 August 2007, eight days before the beginning of operations at Jebel Wasa, to remind him that he was authorised to quarry \" *limestone rock products only* \".838 Indeed, although the Claimant has argued that the Lease Agreements did not limit him to a \" *hard rock* \" quarry,839 he has also acknowledged that \" *the Lease Agreements did not constrain the Ministries, which were not parties to those agreements, when acting in their regulatory capacities* \".840\n\nSuch a claim is inconsistent, for example, with Mr Al Tamimi's knowledge that OMCO had applied on 17 February 2008 to MOCI for an extension to mine in the *wadi*, because Emrock lacked an existing right to do so: see **Exhibit J-156** ; **Exhibit J-178** ; First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [119].\n\n**Exhibit J-108** ; **Exhibit J-109**.\n\nSee Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 12.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 15. For that reason, it makes no sense for the Claimant to say that \" *Mr Al Tamimi was authorized to excavate sand and gravel pursuant to the Lease Agreements and the EIA* \", as those documents were not regulatory authorisations: see Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 37.\n\n413.\n\nFurthermore, it cannot be said that the Claimant reasonably relied upon OMCO to obtain whatever permits he desired, when OMCO's obligation under Article 4(ii) of the Lease Agreements to use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary environmental and operating permits was expressly \" *based* *on and subject to the operations plans and environmental management plan prepared by* \" the Claimant.841 The initial environmental approval granted by MECA, for example, expressly stated at Article 1.1 that it was granted on the basis of Emrock's AEP, which \" *must be accurate and* [represent] *the project that you will be operating* \" and the Ministry must be notified \" *of any changes you intend to introduce. This approval shall be null and void in case of failure to obtain the Ministry's prior approval of any changes you make* \".842 When one examines the terms of the Claimant's AEP, as well as the scope of the Claimant's EIA,843 it is clear that the processing of alluvial material was not an activity for which the Claimant had sought approval from MECA. Rather, the only activity for which approval was sought - and correspondingly granted - was the operation of a hard rock quarry using open-face mining techniques to drill and blast limestone.844\n\n**Exhibit J-048**, Art 4(ii).\n\n**Exhibit J-095**. The Claimant has acknowledged that MECA's environmental approval was based on the project as described in the AEP and EIA: see Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 2, 21 (\" *the scope of proposed operations and lease concession area were detailed in the EIA (J-74)* \").\n\nThere is some confusion as to which version of the EIA prepared by the Claimant's consultants GEO-Resources was actually submitted to the Ministry of Environment. Even at the end of the hearing, it remained an open question which version of the EIA was actually submitted. While Mr Al Tamimi took the position that Version 6 had been submitted by him to OMCO personally (see Transcript, Day 2 at 55:16-23 (Al Tamimi)), the Respondent submitted that there is \" *no hard and fast evidence* \" of what OMCO or Emrock actually submitted to the Ministry of Environment: see Respondent's Post-Hearing Answers at 14. What is clear is that the final version, Version 7, was never submitted to MECA, because according to Mr Van der Wiele of GEO-Resources the seventh and final version was \" *waiting in* [Geo-Resource's] *office for collection and for submission* \" but was never picked up by any Emrock representative: Transcript, Day 5 at 96:4-21 (Van der Wiele). The Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that Version 6 (**Exhibit J-074**) represents the most likely version on the basis of which MECA assessed the Claimant's application for an environmental permit (see also Transcript, Day 4 at 130:7-131:19 (Al Waily)).\n\nThe AEP referred to a single \u2018 *open-face quarry* \u2019, with a \u2018 *shared crusher comprising a single primary crusher and two secondary crushing lines of a nominal 750 tonne per hour capacity* \u2019. The subject of the project was described as \u2018 *[c]onstruction grade limestone* \u2019. The project, it was said, \u2018 *will involve the engineering, design, procurement, construction, commissioning and operation of all the elements of a*  ***hard rock quarry*** [\u2026] *Product will comprise approximately one half run of quarry stone and a quarter each of armour stone and crushed aggregate of a total of 15.0 mpta capacity* [\u2026] ***Open-face mining techniques***  *are proposed to be adopted to obtain limestone* [\u2026]\u2019. There followed a detailed description of the technique for quarrying the limestone materials: \u2018 *Quarry stone will be fractured by drill and blast and as required mechanically broken using drill pneumatic chisel. There may be an option of adopting alternative blasting techniques to maintain the gradation of crusher feed, should market requirements dictate* \u2019 (**Exhibit J-077**) (emphasis added).\n\n414.\n\nAdditionally, in terms of the project's location, the Claimant's AEP and EIA make it clear that quarrying activities would occur on the \u2018 *jebel escarpment and adjacent Salalah plains area* [\u2026] *No area of the quarry will be visible from plains area due to the quarry being located behind the jebel front* \u2019.845 The area of operation was described in the AEP as \u2018 *a quarry area of up to 75 Ha of principally denuded steep jebel slope* \u2019.846 These documents disclose no intention by the Claimant -and accordingly no authorisation by the Respondent - to process any *wadi* materials from the alluvial areas west of the Jebel Wasa.847 The only activity expressly anticipated to take place near the *Wadi Sumayni* - and accordingly permitted by MECA as such - was the construction of a labour camp and quarry access road.848\n\n**Exhibit J-077** at 9.\n\n**Exhibit J-077** at 3.\n\nMr Gupta gave evidence that an additional AEP was submitted by OMCO in April 2007, referring to Exhibit J-092. That document, however, similarly provides that the \u2018 *subject of this project* \u2019 is \u2018 *[c]onstruction grade limestone* [\u2026] *from the Jebel Wasa* \u2019 and that \u2018 *[q]uarry stone will be fractured by drill and blast and as required mechanically broken using pneumatic drill chisel* \u2019: Application for Environmental Permit, dated 1 April 2007, Sections 1(E) and 2(H) (**Exhibit J-092**).\n\nThus the only reference to the *wadi* in the AEP comes in the description of \u2018 *[c]onstruction of a mine haul road, secondary crusher and camp* \u2019, which it was said would \u2018 *impact on about 52 Ha of sand and gravel landforms, gravel dominated minor wadi channels and wadi plain* \u2019: **Exhibit J-077** at 4. It was further noted that \u2018 *[a] camp to accommodate 100 persons will be constructed adjacent to the Wadi Wasa exiting the crusher site* \u2019: **Exhibit J-077** at 8. See also **Exhibit J-074** at 2, 12, 20, 24, 41, 45. The EIA made clear that the \u2018 *quarry workings and crushing plant will be located behind the jebel front and not be visible* \u2019: **Exhibit J-074** at 50. See also the Environmental Management Plan (\u2018 **EMP** \u2019), which the Claimant submitted had also been submitted to MECA: Transcript, Day 9 at 50:20-51:2 (Claimant's closing address); Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 23. The EMP states that the quarry would consist of \u2018 *two open cut quarr[y] faces* \u2019 which would be \u2018 *worked by open cut using drill and blast techniques followed by pneumatic breaking if necessary* \u2019, that operations would occur \u2018 *behind the jebel escarpment and adjacent piedmont area* \u2019, and that although the \u2018 *haul road and camp will be located on the piedmont plain at the channel of the Wadi Wasa* [\u2026] *the initial quarry workings and crushing plant will not be visible* \u2019: GEO-Resources Consultancy, Environmental Impact Assessment V 2, dated 1 August 2006 at 2, 7 (**Exhibit J-070**).\n\n415.\n\nSignificantly, Mr Van der Wiele of GEO-Resources, the consulting company who worked with the Claimant to prepare the EIA, gave evidence on behalf of the Respondent that the EIA sought approval only to mine hard rock limestone at Jebel Wasa. The Tribunal has found the evidence of Mr Van der Wiele, as the project's own consulting expert, to be valuable, and thus his evidence is worth quoting at some length:849\n\n*Our understanding, provided by Mr Al Tamimi, was that Emrock (and subsequently Emrock and SFOH) intended to mine construction grade limestone, rock armour and core stone to supply requirements for the Crescent and Palm Islands, which were then being built in the UAE. The proposal was to build and operate a hardrock quarry and to use road licensed heavy haulage vehicles to truck the rock to the UAE.*\n\n[...]\n\n*Mr Al Tamimi never suggested, nor did we understand, that he had the contractual right or even intent to excavate and transport what are referred to as \"wadi materials.\" Wadi materials are distinctly different materials from limestone although they may have had the same genesis. A wadi is a dry watercourse found in valleys or drainage channels. Wadi soils are weathered products of source rock and are generally deeper and support a higher density and range of flora and fauna, often meriting higher levels of environmental protection. Accordingly, had the excavation of sand and gravel from the wadi adjacent to the Jebel Wasa been the subject of the intended Project, then it would have significantly changed our scope of work and we would have made explicit reference to it in the documents we prepared for Mr Al Tamimi.* [\u2026] *[W]e did not do so because Mr Al Tamimi expressed an intention only to operate a hard-rock quarry.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The clear and obvious implication* [from the EIA as prepared by GEO-Resources] *was that Emrock and SFOH intended to quarry rock which was still in the original geological formation (i.e., the steep jebel), not excavate sand and gravel from a wadi.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*[A] contractor seeking to excavate sand and gravel in a wadi and to use an alluvial crusher to do so must obtain the express environmental approvals required for that purpose.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Indeed, as best I can recall, during our initial site meeting as we walked down the wadi in question, I specifically explained to Mr Al Tamimi that he needed to find a way to access the basin (the part of the quarry where operations would take place) without disrupting the wadi. As part of this discussion, I made clear that wadi areas are protected and that he could not excavate or quarry wadi materials without express permission from the competent authorities. I have no doubt that Mr Al Tamimi understood what I told him, and the advice could not be more clearly stated.*\n\nFirst Van der Wiele Witness Statement at [12]-[13], [15], [25], [33].\n\n416.\n\nIn short, it is clear to the Tribunal that the relevant issues which arose between the Claimant and the Omani ministries related not to the precise boundaries of the Claimant's authorised worksite, but to the Claimant's wholesale disregard for the terms of his approvals. Specifically, Mr Al Tamimi proceeded from 2007-2009 to undertake two activities he had never been authorised to do:\n\na. operate in the *wadi* area, outside the concession boundaries (as well as all permitted boundaries); and\n\nb. process *wadi* alluvial materials (sand and gravel) in addition to hard rock limestone.\n\n*Consistent regulatory warnings: 2006-2008*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nIt was this conflict which continued into 2009, and not, the Tribunal finds, any issue resulting from regulatory uncertainty as to the precise boundaries of the Claimant's concession.850 There is no evidence that the Omani authorities took action adverse to the Claimant owing to the confusion between the boundaries of the quarry site authorised by MECA and MOCI. In clear contrast, as the Respondent has submitted, there was no confusion or ambiguity about Mr Al Tamimi's unauthorised excavation of alluvial material from the *wadi*.851\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the earlier \"conflicting coordinates\" confusion had no enduring effect after the entry into force of the US-Oman FTA on 1 January 2009. The Tribunal is strengthened in this conclusion by the observation that, in any event, a breach generally cannot be considered \" *maintain[ed]* \" if only its ***effects*** endure after the entry into force of the relevant Treaty (see eg the Claimant's description of the FET breach in its Post-Hearing Answers that \" *the*  ***confusion***  *remained when the FTA came into force on 1 January 2009, and it certainly had*  ***substantial impacts***  *after that date* \": Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 3 (emphasis added). The Crawford Commentary to Art 14 of the ILC Articles supports the view that \" *[a]n act does not have a continuing character merely because its effects or consequences extend in time* \": **CLA-081** at 60. Similarly, the cases cited by the Claimant make clear that a breach may only be found where the violation itself is of a \" *continuing or composite character* \" (*Iona Micula et al v Romania* (ICSID Case No ARB/05/20), Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008 at [157] (**CLA-041**)), or a \" *constituting part, concurrent factor or aggravating or mitigating element of conduct* \" (**CLA-021** at [68]). In the words of the tribunal in *Mondev International v USA*, \" *it must still be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach* \" (*Mondev International Ltd v United States of America* (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/99/2), Award, 11 October 2002 at [70] (**CLA-074**)). Ultimately, however, the Tribunal need not make any definitive determination on this point - any such finding would, strictly speaking, be only an *obiter* finding, and the issue was not thoroughly canvassed by the parties in their submissions.\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [382].\n\n418.\n\nIndeed, if there was any issue on which the Respondent's ministries were very consistent and very transparent, it was that the Claimant was not permitted to carry out alluvial processing in the *wadi*. Mr Al Tamimi was repeatedly advised, either directly or in face-to-face meetings or through official communications sent to OMCO and forwarded by it to Emrock, that MECA and MOCI both considered that he was not entitled to conduct alluvial processing outside of the area permitted by the Environmental Permit (MECA) and the area permitted by the Certificate of Quarry Operation (MOCI). It suffices to list a brief summary of this evidence for contextual purposes:852\n\n\u2022 On 22 September 2007, MOCI wrote to OMCO alleging that operations were being conducted \u2018 *beyond the borders of the delimited site for operations* \u2019.853\n\n\u2022 On 29 September 2007, Mr Al Waily of OMCO wrote to Mr Al Tamimi to say that pursuant to OMCO's fax of the previous day, the processing of \u2018 *material originating in the alluvial deposits located in the area's streams* \u2019 was \u2018 ***in violation of our Lease agreement and the environmental permits*** \u2019. OMCO noted that Mr Al Tamimi had already been informed twice of this issue and stated that Emrock had until 31 October 2007 to stop its *wadi* operations or OMCO would \u2018 *deem the agreements terminated and shall seize the property and its premises through physical occupation* \u2019.854\n\n\u2022 On 7 October 2007, Mr Al Waily forwarded Mr Al Tamimi a letter from MECA, noting that \u2018 *[w]e have received a serious complaint from the Environment & Climate Affairs authorities as per copy of letter dated 7th October 2007 attached, which needs to be addressed immediately* \u2019. The letter, issued by the Director-General of Environmental Affairs and Nature Conservation at MECA, notified OMCO that Emrock was using a crusher in the *wadi* without the necessary approvals.855\n\n\u2022 On 12 November 2007, MOCI wrote to OMCO, in a letter subsequently passed on to Mr Al Tamimi, emphasising that the project should take place within the coordinates issued by the Ministry in its quarrying contract and that the license \u2018 *is only for limestone mining* \u2019.856\n\n\u2022 On 28 January 2008, Mr Al Waily forwarded a letter from MECA dated 21 January 2008 and notified Mr Al Tamimi that \u2018 *the permit issued* [\u2026] *by the Environmental authority and Ministry of Commerce & Industry only cover* [sic] *the Drilling and Blasting of the Limestone within the boundaries of our concession and that*  ***no permit has ever been issued for*** ***processing wadi material and screening, which is being the case under your current operation*** [\u2026] ***screening of wadi material must be stopped henceforth*** \u2019.857\n\n\u2022 On 21 April 2008, MOCI wrote to Mr Al Waily noting that after \u2018 *repeated visits by the Ministry officials to the site* [\u2026] *it was revealed that the company's operations are not confined to the specified sites despite repeated letters addressed to the company to stop operation outside the specified coordinates of the quarry* \u2019 and demanded immediate suspension of all operations outside the site specified in the license and payment of a fine of RO 10,000.858\n\n\u2022 On 22 April 2008, OMCO wrote to Mr Al Tamimi demanding that Emrock cease unauthorised extraction of *wadi* material, noting that \u2018 *[w]e have personally verified that you are still carrying out this activity as recently as Saturday 19th April, 2008* \u2019 and that \u2018 ***[i]t has*** ***been repeatedly explained to you that the utilization of this wadi material is not permitted***  *by the pertinent Omani authorities, including the Ministries of Environment, Commerce & Industry, and Housing* \u2019859\n\n\u2022 On 8 October 2008, MOCI issued a further warning to OMCO and Emrock objecting to Emrock's installation of a \u2018 *screen for the production of sand and gravel* \u2019.860\n\n\u2022 On 27 October 2008, OMCO sent to Mr Al Tamimi an infraction report issued by MOCI dated 11 October 2008. That infraction report imposed a further fine of RO 1,000 on OMCO owing to Emrock's unauthorised operation of a crusher to excavate sand and gravel.861\n\nAgain, although these pre-2009 citations are not directly at issue under Art 10.5, it is worth bearing in mind the controlling injunction under Art 10.10 of the US-Oman FTA that \u2018 *[n]othing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns* \u2019.\n\n**Exhibit J-115**.\n\n**Exhibit J-118** (emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit J-122**.\n\n**Exhibit J-128**.\n\nLetter from Mr Al Waily to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 28 January 2008 (**Exhibit J-148**) (emphasis added).\n\nLetter from MOCI to Mr Al Waily, dated 21 April 2008 (**Exhibit J-170**).\n\n**Exhibit J-171** (emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit J-216**.\n\nLetter from OMCO to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 27 October 2008 (**Exhibit J-224**).\n\n419.\n\nThus it is clear to the Tribunal that by the time the US-Oman FTA came into effect on 1 January 2009, the enduring dispute between the Claimant and OMCO/MECA/MOCI concerned Emrock's unauthorised mining of alluvial materials on the *wadi* plain adjacent to the Jebel Wasa concession, and did ***not*** arise from any ongoing confusion or inconsistency as to the precise boundaries of Emrock's worksite. Indeed, the evidence shows that on only one occasion did OMCO raise concerns about Emrock's conducting of blasting (ie non-alluvial) operations outside the concession zone.862 There is no evidence that the earlier confusion between MOCI and MECA as to the boundaries (or overlap of boundaries) controlled by their respective permits was the operative cause of any of the conduct or events which took place in 2009. The real source of the Claimant's continuing problems with OMCO, MECA and MOCI was his unauthorised exploitation of *wadi* materials in an area not permitted by any of the relevant permits. This point was made by Mr Al Waily during his crossexamination: Mr Al Tamimi, he said, was \" *mainly focused on the wadi* \" rather than on the hard-rock quarrying operation behind the Jebel Wasa.863\n\n**Exhibit J-117**.\n\nTranscript, Day 4 at 200:24 (Al Waily).\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimant's submission that \" *the issue in this case is whether Oman's behaviour complied with* *the requirements of the Free Trade Agreement, not whether Mr Al Tamimi made any mistakes* \" and that \" *[t]he question of* [his] *full compliance with environmental laws, regulations and permits is not before the Tribunal* \"864 cannot get around the fact that Mr Al Tamimi was largely the author of his own misfortune in respect of the events of 2009 of which he now complains.865 The Claimant, indeed, made a significant admission on this point in his Pre-Hearing Submission, stating that if the Respondent was concerned he was \" *allegedly operating outside the boundary in an uninhabited area* \", this could have easily been dealt with simply by \" *an additional land purchase, a swap of one parcel of land for another, or, at worst, preventing only the operations that were allegedly out of bounds* \".866\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [11]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 46.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [8]. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 3 (\" *Even if Mr Al Tamimi had committed some violations of environmental law, Oman's actions would still be a gross violation of the customary international law principle of proportionality* \").\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [8]. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 49 (\" *[t]he alleged environmental infractions for which Oman forcibly closed Claimant's quarry were not serious in nature or degree* \"). See also Claimant's Reply at [51] (\" *Claimant does not dispute that Emrock excavated sand and gravel (so-called* *\u2018wadi materials') from within its concession area, primarily in order to pave access roads when it was building the* *site, and also sold some to customers* \u2019).\n\n421.\n\nThe Claimant has again relied upon the decision of the Ibri Court of Appeal to support his claim that he was not operating outside the scope of his permits.867 The Tribunal reiterates that it does not consider itself bound by the fact-finding of the Ibri Court of Appeal.868 In any event, the Tribunal does not consider the Court to have \u2018 *definitively* \u2019 determined this issue as the Claimant has suggested. Rather, the Court of Appeal's decision merely confirmed the uncontested facts that Emrock had been operating pursuant to a lease agreement with OMCO, and that OMCO had obtained an environmental approval from MECA.869 The Court did not directly address whether the scope of the environmental approval granted to Mr Al Tamimi permitted him to process alluvial materials from the *wadi* riverbed. At most, the Court's decision indicates that the requisite elements of the specific criminal charges brought against Mr Al Tamimi had not been proven. To the extent that such a finding could be read as implicitly suggesting, as the Claimant has submitted, that Emrock was operating at all times exclusively within the scope of its regulatory approvals, this Tribunal respectfully disagrees.\n\nSee eg Claimant's Reply at [183].\n\nSee [358]-[361] above.\n\n**Exhibit J-354** at 4-5.\n\n422.\n\nThe Claimant has relied on the evidence given to the Ibri Court of Appeal by Mr Abdul Rahman, field surveyor for MOH, which the Claimant submits proved that that his \u2018 *operations were wholly inside the OMCO concession boundary* \u2019.870 Putting to one side the fact that this would not, in any event, entitle the Claimant to disregard the terms of his approvals from MECA and MOCI, Mr Rahman himself gave evidence to this Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent that he marked only two of the five boundaries of the OMCO concession, and was not asked to assess whether Mr Al Tamimi or Emrock had been operating inside the OMCO concession boundaries. Mr Rahman affirmed in his Witness Statement that:871\n\n*I do not know anything about the concession granted to Oman Mining Company and I do not know anyone at Oman Mining Company or at the Ministry that granted the concession to Oman Mining Company.*\n\n[...]\n\n*I had gone to the site as instructed only to mark the boundary angles of the site and not for any other reason. I have no knowledge of anything concerning the site other than what I did on 4 May 2009 to mark the two boundary angles.*\n\n[...]\n\n*As to the testimony I provided to the Court, it was only about the duties of my position and what I did on 4 May 2009 to determine the boundary marks.*\n\nClaimant's Reply at [5].\n\nRahman Witness Statement at [6], [8]-[9].\n\n*Events of 2009*\n----------------\n\n423.\n\nBetween 7 and 11 February 2009, MECA issued a further four separate citations against OMCO in respect of Emrock's conduct at the Jebel Wasa quarry site.872 The fines it imposed in relation to these citations totalled RO 12,500 (approximately USD 32,509.75).873 The alleged offences included taking material (gravel and sand) from the *wadi*, operating crushers without the necessary permit, failure to obtain permits to construct housing for labourers, and uprooting trees.874 The imposition of these fines was clearly closely causatively connected with the earlier 2007-2008 dispute over Emrock's processing of *wadi* materials, for which the previous fines had been issued. The fines were not, however, causatively connected with the prior \" *conflicting coordinates* \" issue.\n\n**Exhibit J-257**.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [107].\n\n**Exhibit J-257**.\n\n424.\n\nIn the first paragraph of a letter dated 3 March 2009, forwarding the MECA citations to Mr Al Tamimi, OMCO stated that:875\n\n*You state that you have undertaken no illegal activity. This is of course wholly untrue. Please find attached, for instance, the latest fines resulting from your illegal activity. This is in addition to all the earlier fines which are irrefutable documentary proof of your wrongdoing.*\n\n**Exhibit J-257**.\n\n425.\n\nThe letter of 3 March 2009 went on to say that:876\n\n*You suggest we had an obligation to get you permits to process wadi material originating in the alluvial deposits. This is of course incorrect and we have not breached Clause 4. The contract makes it clear that you only ever had a right to* *exploit limestone resources. We got you all the permits necessary to enable you to perform the subject matter of the contract.*\n\n**Exhibit J-257**.\n\n426.\n\nThe first infraction report, dated 7 February 2009, cited breaches including \u2018 *[p]roduction of stones and sand from the River stream* \u2019 and \u2018 *[i]nstalling a new crushing machine (screening and crushing unit) inside the River quarry* \u2019.877 This was clearly not a dispute about the scope of MECA's environmental permit - indeed, the Ministry apparently considered the infractions so unrelated to the work actually permitted that it listed the relevant environmental permit as \u2018 *none* \u2019.878 The further MECA infraction reports dated 8 February 2009 and 11 February 2009 concerned both related and unrelated violations, including \u2018 *[o]perating a crushing and screening unit for stones and sand production* [\u2026]\u2019 and \u2018 *using* [materials] *for stones and sand production* [\u2026] *without the obtaining* [sic] *Environmental permit* \u2019, as well as alleged infractions related to uprooting trees and plants and failure to obtain construction permits for construction work at the quarry.879\n\n**Exhibit J-257**.\n\n**Exhibit J-257**.\n\n**Exhibit J-257**. Although the Claimant has criticised these additional citations (such as the uprooting of trees) as \u2018 *demonstrably false* \u2019 (Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 38), he has not in the Tribunal's view laid an evidential foundation to demonstrate why that is so, or how the issuing of such citations might therefore constitute a breach of the minimum standard of treatment by the Respondent.\n\n427.\n\nThe infraction allegations thus related predominantly, if not exclusively, to the Claimant's wilful infringements of his existing permits, and not to the Respondent's previous provision of conflicting site coordinates. It does not avail the Claimant to say that these violations \u2018 *affected only a portion of Mr Al Tamimi's operations* \u2019 or that \u2018 *Oman has never identified any harm caused or threatened by alleged violations at Mr Al Tamimi's quarry site* \u2019.880 Quite simply, the evidence discloses no connection between these infraction complaints and the earlier 2006-2007 conduct by which the Omani ministries gave inconsistent instructions regarding the scope of the authorised worksite. It cannot be said that the 2009 issues arose as a result of the Respondent's alleged FET breach in 2006-2007.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [53].\n\n428.\n\nSimilarly, OMCO's decision ultimately to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 17 February 2009 - which, as already indicated, brought an effective end to the Claimant's investment in Oman - cannot be said to have arisen as a result of the Respondent's allegedly inconsistent or non-transparent conduct during 2006-2007. As previously noted, the actual decision made by OMCO to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement is not the proper subject of the Tribunal's consideration. Even if it were accepted that the Respondent could be liable for having brought about the circumstances in which OMCO felt compelled to terminate the lease agreement, the Tribunal does not consider that there is any causal connection between the Respondent's conduct and OMCO's decision to terminate.\n\n429.\n\nOMCO's decision to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement was expressly predicated upon Emrock's failure to make contractual payments to OMCO as required. In its second termination notice of 17 February 2009, OMCO alleged a balance due of RO 35,440,435 (approximately USD 92,000).881 The payments were itemised in a schedule attached to the termination notice, and included overdue payments relating to the submission of the AEP, rental for water wells, lease payments for November-December 2007 and January-April 2008, and office space rental from January-December 2008. Only one overdue payment item concerned a fine, and the schedule made clear that this was a penalty levied against OMCO in 2008 for Emrock's conduct in \" *[c]arrying Wadi Material from Project Site* \".882 Only two days before the second termination notice, on 15 February 2009, OMCO had written to Emrock noting yet again Emrock's \" *continuing to transport sand from the wadi neighbouring the quarry* \" as well as \" *the presence of screen in an area without a license* \".883\n\n**Exhibit J-250**.\n\n**Exhibit J-250**. The Claimant acknowledges that he never paid these fines: see eg Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 50.\n\nLetter from OMCO to Mr Al Tamimi, dated 15 February 2009 (**Exhibit J-246**).\n\n430.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's contention that the Respondent's provision of conflicting coordinates in 2006-2007 somehow caused or created the context whereby the Claimant was subject to ongoing fines and sanctions in 2009, or whereby OMCO was compelled to terminate the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, cannot withstand close scrutiny. Whatever the position in 2006-2007, it therefore cannot be said that the actions of MECA and MOCI caused loss to the Claimant's investment after 1 January 2009. Rather, the conclusion of the Tribunal is aptly summarised by Mr Van der Wiele in his first Witness Statement:884\n\n*Mr Al Tamimi's understanding seemed to be that once he had received the* *temporary environmental approval granted by* [MECA] *on 25 April 2007, he could do whatever he wanted. This was plainly not the case* [\u2026].\n\nFirst Van der Wiele Witness Statement at [37].\n\n431.\n\nAccordingly, no breach of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5 has been established in this respect.\n\n2. State harassment claim\n-------------------------\n\n432.\n\nThe Claimant has additionally submitted that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 through its conduct following the termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement on 17 February 2009. This, he has claimed, arises from Oman's actions, through OMCO and other instrumentalities, including MECA and the Royal Oman Police, in forcing the Jebel Wasa Quarry to cease operations, including the arrest and subsequent prosecution of Mr Al Tamimi. The Claimant has submitted that the result was that Oman \" *arbitrarily and discriminatorily enforced a permanent closure of the Claimant's limestone quarry* \".885\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 1.\n\n433.\n\nThis claim confronts the immediate challenge that the Claimant retained no legal right to occupy the Jebel Wasa quarry site - and indeed no primary investment in Oman - after 17 February 2009. If the Claimant felt that his lease had been improperly terminated, it was, as previously noted, open to him to pursue his contractual entitlement under Article 11 of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement to refer his dispute with OMCO to the local Arbitration Centre in Oman.\n\n434.\n\nIt follows that the Claimant cannot bring a claim against the Respondent for breach of the minimum standard of treatment in respect of an investment which no longer existed. The Tribunal finds that government instrumentalities, such as MECA and the Omani Royal Police, were properly entitled to treat the Claimant's investment as having ended, and therefore to require that Emrock cease operations. When interpreting evidence such as Mr Ralutin's account that the police repeatedly showed up at the quarry site to remind Mr Al Tamimi and his staff \" *that they were not allowed to be operating at all* \", the obvious response is that after 17 February 2009 they were perfectly entitled to do so.886 It is an ineluctable fact that from 17 February 2009, Mr Al Tamimi and his staff remained at the quarry site without a lease and therefore only at the sufferance of OMCO and the Omani authorities, who were thus within their rights to insist that he cease activity and remove his equipment from the site. Mr Al Tamimi himself recognised this as early as April 2009 (shortly before his arrest in May 2009), writing to Mr Al Waily that \" *[i]t is quite obvious now, that the situation appears hopeless* \" and that OMCO would *\"be hearing*  *directly*\u00a0\"\u00a0from his lawyers.887\n\nRalutin Witness Statement at [33].\n\nLetter from Mr Al Tamimi to Mr Al Waily, dated 22 April 2009 (**Exhibit J-280**) (original emphasis).\n\n435.\n\nThus, far from the Respondent's conduct being \" *extrajudicial and unjustified* \", it was the Claimant who remained at the quarry without lawful basis. Indeed, on Mr Ralutin's account it appears that the police permitted Emrock to continue trading limestone from existing stockpiles with local buyers long after Emrock's lease had been revoked.888 There is no evidence that the Emrock's employees were \" *dispersed by police harassment* \" as the Claimant has asserted.889\n\nRalutin Witness Statement at [28] and [30] (\" *customers were still coming onto the site with their own trucks to pick up orders for limestone that had already been pre-sold. At first, the number of trucks coming through to pick up their orders was not affected by the fact that we had stopped operations. I was still seeing around the same number of trucks during my shift* \", notwithstanding that \" *the government authorities kept advising that Emrock should not load any trucks or sell any limestone* \"). See also Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [35].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [153].\n\n436.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Claimant's submissions of breach of the minimum standard in relation to his arrest and prosecution (including the undertaking required from him by the Royal Oman Police)890 cannot be said to have affected the Claimant's ability to operate a limestone quarry at the Jebel Wasa, because that right (bestowed as a matter of private contract by OMCO) had by that time ceased to exist.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [198]; Claimant's Reply at [144].\n\n437.\n\nNotwithstanding that his lease with OMCO had been terminated for more than three months by the time of his arrest on 23 May 2009, Mr Al Tamimi apparently continued to operate a quarry at Jebel Wasa without legal right. Dr Al Rushdi, Director of the Legal Department at MECA, gave evidence that when he carried out an inspection of the Jebel Wasa quarry site on 13 April 2009,891 he found Mr Al Tamimi continuing to operate in the very *wadi* area from which he had been expressly forbidden on so many previous occasions. According to Dr Al Rushdi's evidence:892\n\n*When I entered the work site, I immediately noticed that despite MECA's numerous demands that the prohibited operations in the Wadi cease, the work in the Wadi had in fact continued. I raised this concern directly with Mr Al Tamimi, explaining politely that the operations in the Wadi were not authorized, and were being conducted in spite of numerous prior demands that work in the Wadi stop. I also informed Mr Al Tamimi that he could not continue to operate a crusher and transport sand if he had not yet secured the approval to do so.*\n\n*Mr Al Tamimi responded rudely and aggressively, claiming among other things that he would have to study at Omani universities to understand Oman's laws and regulations. Mr Al Tamimi seemed to feign ignorance of the nature of problems even though our Ministry had made clear for months what those problems were, but it seemed to me that Mr Al Tamimi was all too aware that he was not authorized* *to do what he was doing, exploiting and transporting Wadi material, and using a crusher in the Wadi. Mr Al Tamimi sarcastically added that he would stop working* *only if he was provided 150 million dollars' compensation and that he had received* *permission to run at least 20 crushers.*\n\nDr Al Rushdi's site inspection appears to have been partly precipitated by Mr Al Tamimi's own letter to H E Al Busaidi, the Minister of Environment and Climate Affairs, seeking assistance with his case, as well as by the nonpayment of many of the fines levied by MECA: First Al Rushdi Witness Statement at [28].\n\nFirst Al Rushdi Witness Statement at [30]-[31].\n\n438.\n\nDr Al Rushdi's account of events is confirmed by the contemporaneous Field Visit Report prepared by him and dated 13 April 2009.893 Mr Al Tamimi was reportedly again caught excavating *wadi* materials when the Royal Oman Police carried out a site inspection on 23 May 2009, at which point he was arrested.894 There is no evidence to support the Claimant's recent contention that Dr Al Rushdi invented this story after the fact because Mr Al Tamimi refused to pay him a bribe, an accusation which Dr Al Rushdi has strongly denied.895\n\nField Visit Report, dated 13 April 2009 (**Exhibit J-275**).\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [214]. See also Royal Oman Police Department of Criminal Evidence, Photographs relating to Case No 74/J/2009, dated 23 May 2009 (**Exhibit J-300**); Al-Rawdha Police Station, Checking Report, dated 23 May 2009 (**Exhibit J-301**).\n\nSecond Al Rushdi Witness Statement at [3].\n\n439.\n\nIn that context, even if the Claimant had retained an investment capable of being affected after February 2009, the Tribunal finds nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Respondent acted in breach of the minimum standard of treatment. There was certainly nothing \" *extrajudicial*\u00a0\" about the actions taken by MECA, MOCI and the Royal Oman Police.896 Far from having \" *no legitimate basis in law*\u00a0\",897 Mr Al Tamimi's arrest and prosecution took place within the lawful bounds of the Respondent's exercise of its police powers to ensure compliance with its laws, including its environmental laws and regulations.898 Mr Al Tamimi's arrest appears to have been precipitated by a request to the police from Mr Al Muharrami, Director-General of MECA, in response to Dr Al Rushdi's discovery of the Claimant's ongoing unauthorised activities in the *wadi*. In a letter of 19 May 2009, Mr Al Muharrami simply asked the Royal Oman Police to intervene \" *to stop all trucks carrying materials out of the worksite, in order to force the Company to comply with the laws and environmental requirements till the competent judicial authority* [sic] *issue a decision*\u00a0\".899 By that stage, charges against the Claimant (and OMCO) were already pending.900\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [5].\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [5].\n\nAgain see eg **RLA-063** at 79 (\" *According to the doctrine of police powers, certain acts of State are not subject to compensation under the international law of expropriation. Although there is no universally accepted definition in a narrow sense, this doctrine covers State acts such as (a) forfeiture or a fine to punish and suppress crime* [\u2026]\u2019).\n\n**Exhibit J-292.**\n\nTwo claims were filed by MECA against OMCO on 3 March 2009. A third claim was filed on 7 March 2009. Although the charges were directed against OMCO as the responsible party, the Mahda Court of First Instance subsequently accepted OMCO's defence that it should not be held accountable for the offences committed by Emrock: see **Exhibit J-315** ; **Exhibit J-316** ; and **Exhibit J-317**.\n\n440.\n\nThere was nothing *per se* unlawful (at domestic or international law) in MECA forming the view that the Claimant was engaged in unlawful activities and requesting a public prosecutor to file misdemeanour charges. Nor was there anything *prima facie* unlawful about Mr Al Muharrami's request for police intervention upon discovering that Mr Al Tamimi continued to flout Oman's environmental regulations. Indeed, Mr Al Muharrami's letter to the police of 19 May 2009 made specific reference to both Oman's Law on Conservation of the Environment and Prevention of Pollution901 as well as its Regulations for Crushers, Quarries and Transport of Sand from Coasts, Beaches and *Wadi* s.902 In the Tribunal's view, this is precisely the kind of environmental regulatory enforcement that the Parties sought to protect through the inclusion of Article 10.10 (as well as Chapter 17) in the US-Oman FTA.\n\nRoyal Decree No 114/2001 Issuing the Law on Conversation of the Environment and Prevention of Pollution (**RLA-** **055**).\n\nMinisterial Decision No (200/2000) Issuing Regulations for Crushers, Quarries and Transport of Sand from Coasts, Beaches and Wadis (**RLA-050**). See also the letter written by H E Al Busaidi, Minister of Environment and Climate Affairs, to H E Maqbool, Minister of Commerce and Industry, dated 25 April 2009, setting out MECA's list of concerns with Mr Al Tamimi's conduct (**Exhibit J-281**).\n\n441.\n\nIn terms of the arrest itself, Mr Al Tamimi does not claim that any physical violence was involved in his arrest or detention. Although the police initially sought to place Mr Al Tamimi in a holding cell with forty other individuals, they acceded to his objections and subsequently let him sit in a policeman's office.903 Nor was Mr Al Tamimi detained for an unduly lengthy amount of time: his arrest and detention took the Claimant away from the quarry site for only a few hours.904 Indeed, the Respondent has submitted (and the Claimant has presented no evidence to compel an alternative conclusion) that Mr Al Tamimi's very prompt release from police custody \" *was the only event of that day that departed from standard police and prosecutorial practice* \".905\n\nFirst Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [189].\n\nRequest at [59].\n\nOman's Counter-Memorial at [221].\n\n442.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant has alleged that he was coerced into signing an undertaking to cease operations at the quarry site. However, it seems clear from the language of the undertaking that it restricted him from doing no more than operating machinery unlawfully outside his permit area (the police may have been unaware at this stage of the fact that OMCO had already terminated the lease agreement).906 The Tribunal thus accepts the Respondent's submission that the undertaking \" *would not have prevented Mr Al Tamimi from drilling, blasting, and extracting limestone from the Jebel* *Wasa had he still a right to do so under his Lease Agreements* \u2019, which he did not.907 Additionally, the basis for the Claimant's assertion that the Royal Oman Police \" *progressively forced Emrock's employees to leave the quarry site* \u2019 under the \" *pretext* \u2019 of enforcing the undertaking is not clear to the Tribunal.908 There was, it is clear, no right for Emrock's employees to continue to remain there at all. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Respondent removed any employees from the quarry site: in his evidence, Mr Gupta observed that \" *[o]n 31 May 2009, I instructed Emrock's accounts department to suspend all staff at the quarry site due to the stoppage of Emrock's activity by the Government authority* [...] *on August 20, 2009, based on Mr Al TamimiS instruction, I sent a memo to Emrock's site personnel and operators announcing a lay-off due to the stoppage of our operations by OMCO and other Omani authorities* \u2019.909\n\nThe Claimant asserted in his Pre-Hearing Submission that the undertaking was only later \" *interpreted* \" by the police as requiring the complete shutdown of the quarry: Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [5].\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [127].\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [148].\n\nFirst Gupta Witness Statement at [71] and [73]. See also Ralutin Witness Statement at [29] (\" *About two months after Mr Al Tamimi's arrest, Mr Gupta and Mr Balushy directly asked most of our staff to go home, temporarily, advising that that* [sic] *they would reach out when the quarry could re-start production* \u2019). Mr Ralutin himself resigned on 1 March 2010: **Exhibit J-344**.\n\n443.\n\nThe fact that the Claimant was subsequently prosecuted and convicted by the Mahda Court of First Instance, followed by his acquittal by the Omani Court of Appeal, does not in itself disclose any breach of the minimum standard (particularly when one bears in mind the high threshold for breach applied under that standard, as discussed above). It is certainly not the case that every protected foreign investor detained by a State under suspicion of unlawful act(s) is entitled to compensation, even if ultimately acquitted. Mr Al Tamimi was prosecuted for two offences: (a) a misdemeanour charge of ordinary theft for removing *wadi* materials (sand and stones) without the requisite approvals; and (b) the misdemeanour charge of violation of the Environmental Conservation and Pollution Prevention Law by operating quarries and crushers without requisite the approvals.910 On the basis of the facts outlined at [403]-[431] above, it is clear to the Tribunal that very reasonable grounds existed for the suspicion that such offences might have been committed.\n\nRawdha Police Station Referral Order, Case No 74/G/2009, dated 14 June 2009 (**Exhibit J-308**).\n\n444.\n\nAlthough the Claimant was ultimately acquitted of these charges by the Ibri Court of Appeal on 6 June 2010, it does not follow that the Royal Oman Police or the Omani judicial system committed a breach of international law in bringing a prosecution against Mr Al Tamimi. A State must be permitted to take a legal position in relation to the alleged or perceived violation of its existing laws, even if that position turns out ultimately to be wrong, provided it does so in good faith and with appropriate due process.911 To impose international liability in such a context would significantly undermine States' long-recognised right to reasonably exercise their police powers to enforce existing laws. As the Respondent has observed, \" *[t]aken to its logical conclusion, Mr Al Tamimi's position is that any criminal case resulting in acquittal would thereby substantiate claims of prosecutorial misconduct or police malfeasance* \".912 There must be more than the fact of a mere acquittal, the Tribunal finds, to impose liability for law enforcement or prosecutorial conduct under international law.913\n\nSee eg *Eastern Sugar BV v Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), SCC No 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007 at [272] (\" *a BIT may* [\u2026] *not be invoked each time the law is flawed or not fully and properly implemented by a state. Some attempt to balance the interests of the various constituents within a country, some measure of inefficiency, a* *degree of trial and error, a modicum of human imperfection must be overstepped before a party may complain of a violation of a BIT* \") (**RLA-013**).\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [150]. See also **RLA-063** at 93 (if the State makes a *prima facie* case, then the burden falls on the investor \" *to demonstrate that the measure is in fact mala fide, fails to pursue a genuine public purpose, is discriminatory, violates the due-process requirement or is otherwise irregular* \").\n\nIn his Post-Hearing Answers, the Claimant took issue with the fact that the Respondent has not proven actual environmental damage arising from the Claimant's actions: Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 48. In the Tribunal's view, there is no legal basis for the Claimant to assert that the Respondent bears the burden in this proceeding of proving actual environmental damage, including for the purposes of Art 10.10 (the language of which protects State regulatory action which the State \" ***considers appropriate***  *to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns* \" (emphasis added)).\n\n445.\n\nThat principle is given even greater force in the present context by Article 10.10 of the US-Oman FTA, which, it will be recalled, provides specifically that neither party shall be constrained from *\"\"enforcing any measure* [...] *it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns* \".914 While even an express provision such as Article 10.10 will not protect a State from liability for measures that are carried out in bad faith, or in violation of the expected standards of basic fairness or due process, in the present case there is no evidence that MECA, the police or the courts acted against Mr Al Tamimi in bad faith, or for an ulterior purpose, or in a procedurally unfair manner. There is only the Claimant's assertion, which the Tribunal finds to be unsustainable on the evidence, that charges were brought against Mr Al Tamimi as a mere \" *pretext* \" in order for the Respondent to destroy his investment.915 The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's submission that the number of environmental citations previously issued against the Claimant make plain that both his arrest and prosecution were undertaken by the State authorities for a legitimate purpose, rather than the furtherance of a covert political agenda.\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.10.\n\nSee **RLA-063** at 93 (cited by the Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 49) (if the State makes a *prima facie* case that a measure is justified, then the burden falls on the investor \" *to demonstrate that the measure is in fact mala fide, fails to pursue a genuine public purpose, is discriminatory, violates the due-process requirement or is otherwise irregular* \").\n\n446.\n\nThat the Claimant was ultimately acquitted by the Court of Appeal reveals no more *per se* than that the Court did not consider the criminal charges brought against Mr Al Tamimi to be proved to the requisite standard. There is nothing to suggest \" *manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings* \" as described in *Waste Management II*,916 and indeed the Claimant has not sought to impugn the integrity of the court processes.917 Nor does the Claimant's acquittal prove that his arrest or the decision to prosecute him was so grossly arbitrary, unfair or unjust as to constitute a breach by the Respondent of the minimum standard of treatment.918 Even if the Tribunal had found that a principle of proportionality exists as a standalone criterion under the minimum standard of treatment - which question the Tribunal has not found it necessary to consider - any such claim would again have to confront the Respondent's margin of discretion in exercising its police powers to enforce its existing laws, as well as the express protection afforded to the State parties for this purpose under Article 10.10.\n\n**CLA-022** at [98].\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [30] (\" *Contrary to Oman's supposition, Claimant is*  ***not***  *asserting a denial-of-justice claim* \u2019) (original emphasis, citation omitted). Rather, as previously noted, the Claimant has relied extensively upon the decision of the Ibri Court of Appeal for its purported *res judicata* effect.\n\nIndeed, in one sense the Claimant's acquittal by the Ibri Court of Appeal effectively served to vindicate his liberty interest. It is for this reason that denial of justice claims generally first require the reasonable exhaustion of domestic appeal processes: see Jan Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law*, Cambridge University Press (2006) at 100 (\" *States are held to an obligation to provide a fair and efficient*  ***system***  *of justice* [\u2026]\u2019) (**RLA-068**) (original emphasis).\n\n447.\n\nIn short, the evidence shows only that Mr Al Tamimi was (peacefully) arrested, (briefly) detained and (ultimately unsuccessfully) prosecuted by the Omani authorities on misdemeanour charges for breach of the State's environmental laws and regulations. Even if these actions could be considered to be linked to whatever vestigial remnants of his investment the Claimant retained at this point - which the Tribunal considers they cannot - the evidence discloses no breach of the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n3. Quarry vandalism claim\n-------------------------\n\n448.\n\nFinally, there remains to consider the Claimant's contention that the Respondent breached the minimum standard of treatment - including the obligation to provide full protection and security - in allegedly permitting the theft of equipment and other property from the Jebel Wasa quarry site.919\n\nSee eg Claimant's Reply at [150]-[156].\n\n449.\n\nAs already noted above in discussion of the Claimant's expropriation claim, there is no direct evidence that the Claimant's infrastructure and equipment was \" *wrecked, looted and dismantled*\u00a0\".920 To summarise that previous discussion: in his Memorial the Claimant acknowledged that after termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, much of his inventory \" *had already been sold\"* and that his \" *expensive quarrying equipment* \u2019 was \" *quickly sold off or repossessed by and for creditors* \u2019.921 In his Reply, the Claimant suggested that any vandalism or looting at the quarry site could have taken place only after Emrock and its employees had permanently left the quarry site.922 The Claimant's submission that important paper records at the site were destroyed is supported only by Mr Ralutin's witness statement that he \" *heard* \" that this had occurred after Emrock had already \" *abandoned* \" the site.923 The Claimant's submission that the scale bridge was stolen is supported only by a photo indicating that it no longer remains at the site.924\n\nClaimant's Reply at [150].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [184].\n\nClaimant's Reply at [155].\n\nRalutin Witness Statement at [37].\n\n**Exhibit J-390**.\n\n450.\n\nThe scope of a State's full protection and security obligations under the minimum standard simply cannot extend to providing physical protection in perpetuity to an investment that has been expressly \" *abandoned* \" by its owners (and over which all property rights have long been extinguished). As the International Court of Justice stated in the *ELSI* case:925\n\n*[T]he provision of \"constant protection and security\" cannot be construed as the* *giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed.*\n\nCase Concerning Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) (International Court of Justice), Judgment of 20 July 1989 at [108] (**RLA-014**).\n\n451.\n\nThere has, in short, been no credible evidence presented to the Tribunal that the Respondent was responsible for any loss or damage to any property at the Claimant's quarry site, or otherwise failed to act reasonably to protect the Claimant's property. There is no evidence that Oman encouraged or fostered any looting or vandalism at the quarry site. To the extent that the Claimant was willing to abandon his property, he cannot equally assert that the Respondent failed to take steps to preserve it. The Tribunal also recalls the evidence that on and after 17 February 2009, OMCO had repeatedly informed the Claimant that he was to remove all equipment and installations from the site within weeks, given that after 17 February 2009 the Claimant and all his property remained at the site illegally.926\n\nSee [371] above.\n\n452.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds no breach of the minimum standard in this regard.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n453.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal considers that no case for breach of the minimum standard of treatment by the Respondent has been made out. This claim is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**(c) National treatment**\n--------------------------\n\n454.\n\nFinally, the Claimant has submitted that the Respondent breached the national treatment requirements of the US-Oman FTA by failing to treat the Claimant and his investment in the same manner as it did other domestic investors in Oman.\n\n**(i) National treatment under the US-Oman FTA**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nArticle 10.3 of the US-Oman FTA states in relevant part that:\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.*\n\n*2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.*\n\n456.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted, citing the decision in *Feldman v Mexico*,927 that under Article 10.3 he need only establish a *prima facie* case of unequal treatment, after which the burden shifts to Oman to show the absence of unfair discrimination.928\n\n**CLA-020**.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [54].\n\n457.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Feldman v Mexico*, however, did not purport to lay down a special \" *prima facie* \" test for national treatment claims. Rather, the Tribunal simply described the general burden of proof in international law, by which responsibility for establishing a claim rests, first and foremost, on the party who asserts it.929 As with the other provisions of Chapter 10, Oman is not required to disprove the existence of a breach of Article 10.3 in advance. If evidence of disparate treatment is produced by a claimant, then it will certainly be for the responding party to justify or negate that evidence of disparate treatment. But the principle does not obviate the need for a claimant to provide at least some relevant evidence to support his or her claim. Mere assertion will not suffice.\n\n**CLA-020** at [177].\n\n458.\n\nIt bears repeating that Article 10.10 and Chapter 17 of the US-Oman FTA establish that a high threshold must be breached in the enforcement of a State's environmental laws and regulations before it can be considered a violation of Chapter 10. The enforcement of environment laws and regulations, as Article 17.2.1(b) acknowledges, may not always be precisely uniform, involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and allocation of limited governmental resources, and ultimately may not reveal differential treatment based on anything other than the particular circumstances of the alleged offender and the infraction alleged.930 The Claimant must show that the treatment he and his investment received differed materially and substantially from that received by other domestic Omani investors or their investments.\n\nArt 17.2 provides in its subparagraph 1(b) that: \" *[t]he Parties recognize that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other environmental matters determined to have higher priority. Accordingly, the Parties understand that a Party is in compliance with subparagraph (a)* [ *vis* the duty not to fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws] *where a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources\"*. Regarding the relevance of Chapter 17 to the Tribunal's interpretation of the provisions of Chapter 10, see the discussion above at [388]-[389].\n\n**(ii) Alleged breach of the national treatment standard**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe Claimant says that Article 10.3 has been breached as a result of the Respondent's *de facto* discrimination, because although local investors were undertaking essentially the same activities as his quarry, their permits were not interpreted to forbid such activities, and they were not arrested, forced to sign an undertaking to avoid pre-trial incarceration, or permanently shut down on the basis of environmental breaches.931\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [232], [240]; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [55].\n\n460.\n\nAgain, the Claimant's case must fall at the first hurdle because his primary investment in Oman had ceased to exist by the time of the alleged measures comprising his national treatment claim. As noted above, Mr Al Tamimi's arrest and prosecution can have had no practical effect on his investment in Oman, both because: (a) he was detained only for a brief period of time, and even the sentence imposed on him at first instance was suspended; and (b) by this time, OMCO had already terminated the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement, meaning that he had no substantive investment left.\n\n461.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal does not find that a claim for national treatment would be made out. The Claimant relies primarily on the evidence from Mr Gupta of Emrock, who visited a neighbouring quarry and apparently learned that other quarries in the area were operating crushers without a separate crusher permit, as well as reportedly extracting sand and gravel without any special \" *wadi*\u00a0\" permit.932 In his first Witness Statement, Mr Gupta merely concluded that:933\n\n*In my years working in Oman, until this day, I have known quarry operators to have fines imposed on them, and I have also seen situations where the Environmental* *Ministry complained about various issues affecting operations in the quarrying areas. But I have never seen an instance like the one that Mr Al Tamimi faced, in which a quarry operator is arrested, accused of stealing and incarcerated and eventually forced to give up his investment.*\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [31].\n\nFirst Gupta Witness Statement at [76].\n\n462.\n\nIn his second Witness Statement, Mr Gupta provided a somewhat greater degree of specificity, stating that he had previously talked to operators at two neighbouring quarries, the Al Zubaidi quarry and the Al Turki Enterprises quarry, and from those encounters did not \" *believe* \" that those quarries held a special permit for operating crushers.934 Further, he considered, the Al Turki quarry had never had \" *major problems* \" with the Omani authorities, and had received only a \" *few citations* \".935\n\nSecond Gupta Witness Statement at [27]-[28].\n\nSecond Gupta Witness Statement at [27]-[28].\n\n463.\n\nSuch purely anecdotal evidence proves very little on its own. The Claimant has not adduced any objective or quantifiable evidence to show that his quarry was treated in a manner different from that accorded to domestic investors in \" *like circumstances* \".936 The Claimant has correctly observed that in undertaking a comparison between similarly-situated domestic investors, \" *the mere existence of some particular difference does not defeat the existence of like circumstances* \".937 However, to provide a relevant comparison for a national treatment claim, any comparator investor must still be in ***materially*** the same circumstances as the Claimant. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's submission that \" *the Jebel Wasa Quarry should be understood as being in like circumstances with all limestone quarries in Oman* \".938 The Claimant must point to evidence that a domestic operator which possessed the same or substantially similar approvals as the Claimant, and carried out the same or substantially similar material conduct (including the Claimant's repeated violations of the terms of those approvals) was treated less harshly or according to a different standard.\n\n**Exhibit J-001**, Art 10.3.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [235].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [236].\n\n464.\n\nGiven the long history of citations and fines imposed against OMCO/Emrock, there may in fact be no directly relevant comparator, and the Claimant has not been able to adduce evidence of one. The Claimant's case appears, on the evidence, to be *sui generis*. The Claimant has submitted, relying on the evidence of Mr Abdul-Rahman of the Housing Ministry, that the prosecution of Mr Al Tamimi was unprecedented: \" *[a]s far as Mr Abdul-Rahman was aware, only Mr Al Tamimi had been prosecuted for theft* \".939 Yet as H E Al Dheeb, Chairman of OMCO from late 2008 and Undersecretary at MOCI, observed in his evidence, in most instances there would be no need to prosecute an operator because a warning, or at most a fine, would be sufficient to bring an operator into voluntary compliance.940\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [33].\n\nAl Dheeb Witness Statement at [25].\n\n465.\n\nThe comparative examples actually cited by the Claimant are clearly not materially analogous.941 The Claimant's reference to the Omani-owned quarry Emaar, which the Claimant says was permitted to \" *excavate large amounts of materials from the Wadi Sumayni*\u00a0\",942 overlooks the fact that Emaar sought - and was granted - approval to do exactly that.943 The same is true of the Al Turki quarry944 and the Al Ahlia quarry.945 The Claimant's argument that other quarries were permitted to continue operating \" *once they had paid for the additional land*\u00a0\"946 is unavailing, because in the Claimant's case a boundary extension, although sought by OMCO, was never granted.947 Similarly, although Mr Gupta notes that the Al Zubaidi and Al Turki operations were never required by Oman to \" *shu[t] down* [their] *complete operations*\u00a0\", there is no suggestion that those quarries, unlike the Claimant's, had had all their contractual rights to operate terminated by their contractual counterparty.\n\nSee eg First Al Tamimi Witness Statement at [199].\n\nClaimant's Memorial at [246]-[247]; Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 3.\n\nSee Initial Environmental Approval of Enmaar Mahada Company, Project No 1266/Z H, issued 27 August 2008 (**Exhibit J-205**) (which the Claimant describes as \" *[a]pproving Emaar's application to excavate and crush materials from the Wadi Sumayni* \u2019: Claimants Post-Hearing Answers at 49). Whether Emaar or any other quarry received an environmental approval without prior submission of an EIA or EMP - an inference which the Claimant seeks to draw from the Respondent's failure to discover any such documents in its files - is not, strictly speaking, a relevant comparison for the purposes of the Claimant's national treatment claim: see Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 3. In any event, there are serious doubts about the extent of the material which the Claimant himself supplied to MECA for permitting purposes: see fnn 843 and 848 above.\n\nApplication for Environmental Permit of Al Turki Cement Products, undated (**Exhibit J-406**).\n\nApplication for Environmental Permit of Al Ahlia, dated 16 August 2000 (**Exhibit J-412**).\n\nSee Claimant's Reply at [188].\n\nSee [405] above. The Claimant has also relied on the testimony of Mr Abdul Rahman, a surveyor at MOH, before the Ibri Court of Appeal to the effect that other quarries had been permitted to operate outside their concession limits by paying additional amounts: Claimant's Post-Hearing Answers at 49-50. Again, however, such evidence is unspecific, indirect (the Claimant relies on the summary of Mr Rahman's testimony which appeared in the defence closing address to the Ibri Court of Appeal) and appears to be disavowed by Mr Rahman himself: see Rahman Witness Statement at [8]-[9].\n\n466.\n\nThe Respondent has, in any event, pointed to evidence that the Claimant is not the only operator in Oman to be investigated by the Omani authorities for quarrying violations: according to one news 2013 report, 193 cases had been referred to the public prosecutor's office, including cases where operators were investigated for \" *extending the areas that were allocated to them* \u2019, failing to pay fees, and operating stone crushers without a license.948 Another news report noted that \" *dozens of sites* \u2019 allotted for quarrying and crushing had been shut down by the government for operating \" *beyond the limits set by their licenses* \".949 Indeed, media reports indicate that in 2013 the Omani government declared a \" *moratorium on the issuance of new permits for quarrying and crushing activities, coupled with an extensive review of practices in the mining and quarrying industry* \", including the appointment of a \" *pan-sectoral committee* \" to address the issue of mining violations.950 The Claimant has suggested that this \" *supposed crackdown on quarries* \" was promoted by the government in 2013 in anticipation of Oman facing a national treatment claim in this arbitration.951 Such a claim is implausible.\n\nMohamed Ali al-Balushi, \"The Public Prosecution Office Investigates the Violations of Stone Crushers and the Grant Lands in Duqm\u2019, available at avb.s-oman.net (**Exhibit J-370**). See also \"Two Quarries Ordered Shut in Dhahirah\u2019, *Times of Oman*, 19 February 2014 (**RLA-89**); \"Oman Government Toughens Stance on Mining Industry\u2019, *Gulf* *News*, 26 April 2013 (**RLA-090**); \"Two Quarry Units Shut Down for Violating Norms\", *Times of Oman*, 19 February 2014 (**RLA-091**).\n\n**RLA-090**. It bears repeating in this context that the Tribunal has found that the Emrock quarry was never shut down by Oman - it lost its right to operate only as a result of OMCO's private termination of the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement.\n\n**RLA-090**.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Skeleton at [34].\n\n467.\n\nThere is no evidence, furthermore, that the Claimant was treated in a particular manner because of his nationality. Indeed, the fact that citations and fines were imposed in the first instance against OMCO, a state-owned enterprise, and that OMCO's Mr Al Waily, an Omani citizen, was prosecuted along with Mr Al Tamimi,952 points strongly away from the Claimant's assertion that he was targeted because of his foreign nationality. As the Respondent has submitted, it is plain that the Claimant was targeted not because of his nationality but because, rather than adhering to the terms of his permits, he \" *decided to embark on a materially different operation outside the Jebel Wasa* \".953\n\nMr Al Waily was ultimately acquitted by the Mahda Court of First Instance because it found that Emrock, and not OMCO, was the entity actually responsible for control of the quarry site: **Exhibit J-315** ; **Exhibit J-316** ; **Exhibit J-317** (\" *the Public Prosecution shall bring the real accused to trial* \").\n\nOman's Rejoinder at [191].\n\n468.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses the Claimant's national treatment claim.\n\n**D. COSTS**\n------------\n\n469.\n\nBoth parties have sought costs in this proceeding, if successful. The Claimant has claimed US$15,530,714.93 in costs, including attorney's fees and disbursements for the four law firms variously involved in his case, as well as expert witness and consultants' fees and ICSID payments.954 The Respondent has claimed US$7,569,880.32 in costs, also including attorney's fees and disbursements, expert witness and consultants' fees and ICSID payments.955\n\nSee Claimant's Updated Submission on Costs.\n\nSee Respondent's Statement of Costs.\n\n470.\n\nArticle 10.25.1 of the US-Oman FTA provides in relevant part that in making its Award:956\n\n*A tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.*\n\nUS-Oman FTA, Art 10.25(1).\n\n471.\n\nThe \" *applicable arbitration rules* \" include Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that:957\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\nICSID Convention, Art 61(2).\n\n472.\n\nRule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Rules additionally provides that the Tribunal shall include in its Award \" *any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding* \".958\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules, Rule 47(1)(j).\n\n473.\n\nUnder the US-Oman FTA and the ICSID Convention, therefore, the Tribunal has a broad discretion to determine \" *how and by whom* \" the expenses of this arbitration, including attorney's fees, should be paid. The rule that costs follow the event (otherwise known as the \" *loser pays* \" rule) has received growing support in many investment arbitrations.959 The Tribunal finds that, in the circumstances of this particular arbitration, the application of this principle is appropriate. Both parties have made claims for costs on that basis.960 The Claimant's alternative submission that, in the event that Oman were to prevail, \" *it would be inequitable for the Tribunal to force Mr Al Tamimi to pay any of Oman's costs, given that Oman incurred those costs to defeat Mr Al Tamimi's efforts to seek justice for the mistreatment that he suffered at Oman's hands* \" is not convincing.961\n\nSee eg *Gold Reserve v* Venezuela (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/09/1), Award, 22 September 2014, cited in Claimant's Submission on Costs at fnn 1 and 2; *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v Republic of Georgia* (ICSID Case Nos ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15), Award, 3 March 2010 (**RLA-077**); *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp v United Mexican States* (NAFTA Ch 11 Arb Trib), Award, 26 January 2006, cited in Respondent's Submission on Costs at fn 4; *EDF (Services) Ltd v* Romania (ICSID Case No ARB/05/13), Award, 8 October 2009, (**RLA-076**); *Methanex v United States of America* (UNCITRAL/NAFTA)), Award, 3 August 2005 (**CLA-073**); *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v Ukraine* (ICSID Case No ARB/08/16), Award, 31 March 2011, cited in Respondent's Submission on Costs at fn 4.\n\nSee Claimant's Submission on Costs (as corrected 9 March 2015) at [3]-[7]; Claimant's Reply to Respondent's Cost Submission at [12]-[13]; Respondent's Submission on Costs at 2-6.\n\nClaimant's Submissions on Costs (as corrected 9 March 2015) at [10]. See also Claimant's Reply to Oman's Cost Submission at [11].\n\n474.\n\nThe Tribunal has dismissed all claims for breach of the US-Oman FTA brought by the Claimant. As such, the Tribunal accepts the submission that Oman has been required to defend itself against claims that have ultimately proven to be entirely unmeritorious. In particular, the Tribunal considers that it should have been clear to the Claimant prior to commencing proceedings that the rule against the retroactive application of treaties, as well as the narrow scope of attribution under Article 10.1.2 of the US-Oman FTA, posed serious barriers to the overall viability of the Claimant's suit. The Tribunal has also borne in mind that the evidence, as outlined extensively above, shows Mr Al Tamimi largely to have been the author of his own misfortune through his wilful disregard of Oman's environmental laws.\n\n475.\n\nIn light of these findings, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant should be required to cover a substantial proportion of both the costs of this arbitration and the Respondent's legal and other professional costs, including expert and consultancy fees.\n\n476.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted that the Respondent's conduct unnecessarily increased the cost of this arbitration, and that \" *apart from the merits* \", he should be awarded costs on this basis.962 The Claimant has submitted that the Respondent's conduct during the early phases of proceedings, and in particular its refusal to permit the Claimant to carry out a site visit with his experts until ultimately ordered to do so by this Tribunal, added to the Claimant's legal costs.963 The Claimant has also submitted that the Respondent prolonged proceedings by maintaining its unmeritorious claim regarding Mr Al Tamimi's nationality.964\n\nSee Claimant's Reply to Oman's Cost Submission at [2ff].\n\nSee Claimant's Reply to Oman's Cost Submission at [5ff].\n\nSee Claimant's Reply to Oman's Cost Submission at [3].\n\n477.\n\nOn the former issue, the Tribunal does not consider that these procedural issues should alter its finding as to costs. Although the Claimant ultimately prevailed on his request for a site visit, it will be recalled that the Tribunal considered that the eleventh-hour nature of his request had not been adequately explained, and therefore declined his request for an immediate inspection.965 In short, the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent has acted in these proceedings in an unprofessional manner as the Claimant has alleged. The outcome of minor procedural disputes does not alter the fact that the Claimant has put the Respondent to the expense of defending a series of claims that have ultimately proven unsuccessful.\n\nProcedural Order No 2, 28 September 2012.\n\n478.\n\nOn the latter issue, however, the Tribunal agrees that the Respondent's challenge to Mr Al Tamimi's nationality was vaguely and equivocally articulated, and ultimately unsuccessful. The Respondent was also unsuccessful as to its challenge of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* regarding the OMCO-Emrock Lease Agreement. Considering the circumstances as a whole, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant should reimburse the Respondent for 75% of the Respondent's total costs.\n\n479.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent has claimed total costs of US$7,569,880.32, which sum comprises attorney's fees and disbursements of US$5,335,095.52, expert witness and consultancy fees of US$1,784,819.90 and ICSID payments totalling US$449,965.00. The Tribunal has examined these claimed costs and found them to be reasonable in the circumstances, particularly when considered in the context of the Claimant's own claimed fees and expenses.\n\n480.\n\nAccordingly the Tribunal shall order that the Claimant pay to the Respondent the sum of US$5,677,410.24, being a 75% share of its total costs of US$7,569,880.32.\n\n481.\n\nPost-Award interest shall be payable on these costs as from 60 days after the date of the issue of this Award. Interest shall be calculated at the 91-day US Treasury Bill rate and compounded quarterly.\n\n**VII. OPERATIVE PART**\n-----------------------\n\n[482].\n\n**For all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all claims and submissions to the contrary, the Tribunal HEREBY FINDS, DECLARES AND AWARDS as follows:**\n\n1. The Tribunal rejects all of the Claimant's requests for declaratory and compensatory relief.\n\n2. The Tribunal orders that the Claimant shall pay to the Respondent forthwith the sum of US$5,667,410.24, which comprises the Respondent's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration, including the cost of their legal representation, expert witness and consultants' fees, disbursements associated with this proceeding, and the Respondent's share of the ICSID arbitration costs and lodging fees paid.\n\n3.
