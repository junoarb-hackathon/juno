PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 14 July 2023, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 with a draft procedural calendar to the Parties.\n\n2.\n\nOn 28 July 2023, after conferring among themselves, the Parties transmitted their comments on draft Procedural Order No.1 and their proposals for the procedural calendar.\n\n3.\n\nOn 2 August 2023, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties, during which draft Procedural Order No. 1, including the Parties' proposed procedural calendars, were discussed with the Parties.\n\n4.\n\nOn 23 August 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 together with a procedural calendar in Annex B.\n\n5.\n\nOn 21 November 2023, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits pursuant to the procedural calendar.\n\n6.\n\nOn 22 December 2023, the Respondent filed a request for suspension of the proceeding and other requests (the \"**Request**\") along with factual exhibits R-001 through R-007 and legal authorities RL-001 and RL-002.\n\n7.\n\nOn 23 December 2023, the Claimant requested leave to respond to the Respondent's Request and asked the Tribunal to establish a briefing schedule.\n\n8.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its observations on the Respondent's Request and indicated that the Tribunal would inform the Parties, upon receipt of the Claimant's observations, whether it wishes to receive further observations from the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn 28 December 2023, the Claimant filed its observations on the Request (the \"**Response**\") along with factual exhibits C-413 through C-415 and legal authorities CL-143 through CL-161.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 December 2023, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decisions on the three prayers for relief contained in the Request, and indicated that it would provide a reasoned decision in due course. The Tribunal ruled as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal has decided to reject the Respondent\u2019s request that the Tribunal stay the proceeding until the tribunal in TC Energy Corporation and TransCanada Pipelines Limited v. United States (ICSID Case No. ARB/21/63) rules on the United States \u2019 preliminary objection regarding the scope of Annex 14-C to the USMCA.*\n\n*Further, the Tribunal is not minded to authorize a second potential request for bifurcation, or to preemptively rule on its admissibility, until such request is actually filed. However, as presently advised, the Tribunal does not welcome the prospect of sequential requests for bifurcation due to the obvious procedural inefficiencies that this would produce.*\n\n*Lastly, the Tribunal confirms that the proceeding has not been suspended between the filing of the Respondent\u2019s Requ\u00eate en suspension d\u2019instance on December 22, 2023 and the issuance of the present letter. In accordance with the procedural timetable applicable to this proceeding, the Respondent is therefore expected to submit its Request for Bifurcation, if any, by January 5, 2024.*\n\n11.\n\nThe present procedural order sets out the reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s December 31, 2023 disposition of the Request.\n\n**II. PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n12.\n\nIn its Request, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal: (i) suspend the proceeding until the tribunal in *TC Energy Corporation and TransCanada Pipelines Limited v. United-States* (ICSID Case ARB/21/63) rules on the United States\u2019 preliminary objection regarding the scope of Annex 14-C of the USMCA; (ii) grant leave to the Respondent to file, if it so wishes, a second request for bifurcation within 30 days of the Tribunal\u2019s rejecting its first request for bifurcation, or rejecting its bifurcated preliminary objections; and (iii) provisionally stay the proceeding until the Tribunal rules on the Respondent\u2019s Request, so as to relieve the Respondent from its obligation to file its request for bifurcation by 5 January 2024.1\n\nRespondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, para. 24.\n\n(i) Suspension of the proceeding\n--------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nFirst, the Respondent recalls that the Claimant relies on Annex 14-C to the USMCA to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction and argues, in particular, that while the entry into force of the USMCA has terminated the obligations prescribed in the NAFTA, Annex 14-C extends, until 1 July 2023, the temporal scope of both the dispute settlement mechanism in Section B of NAFTA's Chapter 11 and the substantial obligations prescribed in Section A.2\n\nRespondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, paras. 5-7.\n\n14.\n\nSecond, the Respondent notes that both the US and Mexico are contesting a similar argument raised in two other cases - *TC Energy Corporation and TransCanada Pipelines Limited v. United States* (ICSID Case No. ARB/21/63) (\"**TC Energy**\") and *Legacy Vulcan LLC v. Mexico* (ICSID Case No. ARB/19/1) (\"**Legacy**\") - and that the tribunals in these cases will soon rule on this issue.3\n\nRespondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, paras. 8-14\n\n15.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that Article 54 of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules allows tribunals to suspend proceedings upon request of one of the parties, and that even if decisions by other tribunals would not be binding, the Tribunal would benefit from having the point of view of these tribunals.4 The Respondent adds that given the imminence of these tribunals' rulings, the suspension would likely last only a few months.5\n\nRespondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, paras. 15-19.\n\nRespondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, para. 20.\n\n(ii) Second request for bifurcation\n-----------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent requests leave from the Tribunal to file another bifurcation request within 30 days of the dismissal of its initial bifurcation request or of the dismissal of its bifurcated preliminary objections. The Respondent submits that it has strong arguments - that are not based on the scope of Annex 14-C - to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, and that it will present them in its request for bifurcation. However, should this request for bifurcation be rejected, or the bifurcated objections be ultimately dismissed, the Respondent submits that it should be authorized to file a second request for bifurcation, so as to preserve an opportunity for all objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to be efficiently decided in a preliminary phase rather than presented and decided together with the merits.6\n\nRespondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, paras. 22-23.\n\n(iii) Temporary stay\n--------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal temporarily stay the proceedings until it rules on requests (i) and (ii), so as to relieve the Respondent from its obligation to file a bifurcation request by the date prescribed in the procedural calendar, *i.e.* January 5, 2024.7\n\nRespondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, para. 24. iii.\n\n**B. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant asks the Tribunal to: (i) reject the request to suspend the proceedings;8 (ii) confirm the Respondent\u2019s obligation to file any request for bifurcation within the deadline prescribed in the procedural calendar; (iii) reject the Respondent\u2019s request for the temporary stay of the proceeding; and, (iv) allocate costs in respect of the present proceedings in its favor.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 8-84.\n\n(i) Suspension of the proceeding\n--------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the power to suspend the proceeding must be exercised *\"sparingly, in limited circumstances and only for compelling reasons'*9 and that the Respondent has failed to establish such compelling reasons.10\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 8-53.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 54-84.\n\n20.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant notes that the Respondent\u2019s request is moot and hypothetical since the underlying jurisdictional objections have not yet been raised (and may never be raised).11 The Claimant also submits that the request is based on the wrong premise that (a) the decisions by the other tribunals will be determinative of the Tribunal\u2019s decision in this proceeding,12 and (b) the suspension would only last a few months.13 Further, the Claimant argues that the uncertainty about the timing of the issuance of the other tribunals\u2019 decisions militates against suspension of this proceeding, since by the time the Tribunal is called to rule on its own jurisdiction, the other tribunals will have had issued their decisions.14 In addition, the Claimant contends, the other tribunals\u2019 decisions will likely be made without the benefit of reviewing the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the USMCA (which are kept confidential by the Contracting Parties), which emphasizes the uselessness of awaiting such decisions.15 Lastly, the Claimant notes that the timing of the request to suspend the proceeding - submitted just after the Claimant expended \"enormous efforts\" to timely file its Memorial - undermines the Respondent's contention that a suspension would promote procedural efficiency; for the Claimant, a suspension would unfairly procure the Respondent substantial additional time to prepare its Counter-Memorial.16\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 57-68.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 69-74.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 75-78.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 79-81.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 82-83.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, para. 84.\n\n(ii) Second request for bifurcation\n-----------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's application for permission to make a second request for bifurcation is not supported by the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the NAFTA or the Tribunal's procedural orders in this proceeding and is legally unfounded and procedurally abusive.17\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 85-88.\n\n22.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant notes that the time limits established in ICSID Arbitration Rules 44 and 45 are clear and admit no exception: any request for bifurcation \"shall be filed within 45 days after filing the memorial on the merits.\"18 The Claimant recalls in that respect that the Respondent had initially argued, at the first session, that it could file a request for bifurcation outside of the time window prescribed by Rule 44, which prompted the Tribunal to invite the Parties to files submissions on that point. The Claimant further notes that the Respondent withdrew its position on the day these submissions were due and that the present request is an attempt to re-open this issue.19 For the Claimant, the issue is clearly settled: neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules allow for any derogation to the time limits prescribed in Rule 4420 and the Respondent has provided no compelling reason to depart from the procedural calendar established by the Tribunal.21\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 89-90.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, para. 91.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 92-94.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 95-98.\n\n(iii) Temporary stay\n--------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant submits that absent any compelling reasons justifying reasonable adjustments, the procedural calendar set by the Tribunal must be followed. The Claimant recalls in that respect that the Respondent, despite having been aware for nearly a year of the other proceedings it relies on to justify its request for a suspension, has waited until after the Claimant filed its Memorial to seek said suspension during the year-end holidays. For the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s late attempt to overturn the procedural calendar because it had to take a position by January 5, 2024, is ill-founded and abusive, and should not be rewarded.22\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, paras. 99-105.\n\n(iv) Costs\n----------\n\n24.\n\nIn its prayer for relief, the Claimant requests that, \"in light of the manifestly abusive nature of the Respondent\u2019s Request, both with regard to the timing of its filing and its content\", the Tribunal finds costs - \"in an amount to be determined in due course\" - in its favor.23\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 28 December 2023, para. 106(4).\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Suspension of the proceeding**\n-----------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) and (3) provides:\n\n*(2) The Tribunal may suspend the proceeding upon the request of either party or on its own initiative, except as otherwise provided in the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations or these Rules.*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal shall give the parties the opportunity to make observations before ordering a suspension pursuant to paragraph (2).*\n\n26.\n\nIt is undisputed that, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Tribunal has the power to suspend the proceeding, either on its own initiative, or upon the request of either party. Rule 54(2) does not provide for an automatic or unconditioned suspension of the proceeding upon a party\u2019s request: the Tribunal \"may\" but is not obliged to suspend the proceeding.\n\n27.\n\nIn exercising the authority granted by Rule 54(2), the Tribunal must take into account its general duties under Rule 3(1), which provides as follows: \"The Tribunal and the parties shall conduct the proceeding in good faith and in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.\" Rule 3(2) further provides that \"The Tribunal shall treat the parties equally and provide each party with a reasonable opportunity to present its case\". The Tribunal thus should order suspension if doing so can be considered compatible with its obligation to conduct the proceedings in an expeditious, cost-effective and fair manner.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the party requesting the suspension of the proceeding bears the burden of proving that the suspension is warranted by compelling reasons or good cause24 that justify displacing the presumption that either party is entitled to have the proceeding conducted at a normal pace, according to the procedural timetable, efficiently and expeditiously.25\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Procedural Order No. 18 (26 February 2001), para. 16; *Ayat Nizar Raja Sumrain v. Kuwait* (ICSID Case No. ARB/19/20), Decision on Respondent's Request for Suspension of Proceedings and on the Procedure with regard to Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 23 April 2020, para. 8\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Procedural Order No. 18 (26 February 2001), para. 8*;* *Cargill, Incorporated v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, para. 380; *William Ralph Clayton and others v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Procedural Order No. 19 (10 August 2015), para. 16.\n\n29.\n\nIn making that determination and assessing the reasons advanced by the party requesting the suspension, the Tribunal has regards to the following criteria: (a) balance of convenience; (b) costs and efficiency; (c) procedural propriety; (d) fairness and prejudice.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not established, under any of the aforementioned criteria, that a suspension of the proceedings is warranted or justified. The Tribunal's assessment is based on the following reasons.\n\n31.\n\nFirst, when the procedural calendar was discussed and ultimately established in August 2023, the Respondent was aware of the existence and of the procedural status of the NAFTA cases it relies on to justify its suspension request, including the fact that a jurisdictional objection based on the temporal application of Annex 14-C to the USMCA had been raised in these cases.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent, however, did not raise or even mention these cases and their possible impact on the procedural timetable of the present proceedings during the discussion over the procedural calendar or after it was established. The Respondent only raised that issue on 22 December 2023, *i.e.* a month after the Claimant filed its Memorial and two weeks before the request for bifurcation was due. If the Annex 14-C temporal application issue was, as the Respondent contends, of such paramount importance and relevance to the present proceeding, the Respondent ought to have raised it, and the pending NAFTA cases dealing with it, in a timely manner.\n\n33.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not made any submission on the Annex 14-C temporal application issue in the *TC Energy* and *Legacy* proceedings pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 (as it often does in other NAFTA arbitration proceedings) and has not indicated that it intends to raise a similar objection based on the temporal application of Annex 14-C in the present proceeding.\n\n34.\n\nRegardless of the Respondent\u2019s reasons for not doing so, the Tribunal is not convinced, in these circumstances, that the Annex 14-C temporal application issue pending before the *TC Energy* and *Legacy* tribunals is, at this junction, sufficiently relevant to the present arbitration to justify disrupting the procedural calendar by suspending the proceeding.\n\n35.\n\nThird, the Tribunal considers that the uncertainty regarding the timing of the decisions that the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to await, compounded with the fact that it is unclear whether the Respondent intends at all to raise a jurisdictional objection based on the temporal application of Annex 14-C of the USMCA, casts further and even stronger doubts on the necessity and usefulness of a suspension of the proceeding.\n\n36.\n\nIf the decisions are issued within the timeframe indicated by the Respondent,26 then the Tribunal will have access to them when it has to rule on its own jurisdiction, which makes a suspension unnecessary. If the decisions are not issued within that timeframe of \"a few months\", then either the Tribunal could, *sua sponte* or upon the Claimant\u2019s request, resume the proceeding, which would establish that the suspension was in vain, or the Tribunal could indeed continue the suspension as long as these decisions have not been issued (as requested by the Respondent), which would cause unreasonably long delays in the conduct of the proceeding. Either hypothesis militates against suspension.\n\n\"\u2026*quelques mois tout au plus\" (\"a few months, at most\")*, Respondent's *Requ\u00eate* dated 22 December 2023, para. 20.\n\n37.\n\nFourth, it is undisputed that the decisions in the *TC Energy* and *Legacy* proceedings would not be binding on the Tribunal, so while these rulings could theoretically be of interest (subject to paragraph 38 below), the Tribunal does not need them, let alone need to wait for them, to be in a position to make a determination regarding its jurisdiction.\n\n38.\n\nFifth, should the decisions in the *TC Energy* and *Legacy* proceedings be issued within the timeframe indicated by the Respondent, their usefulness, relevance and probative value would be limited since they would not reflect or benefit from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the USMCA, which will be kept confidential until at least July 2024.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that:\n\ni. The balance of convenience is in favor of allowing the proceeding to continue without a suspension. A suspension would affect to a much greater extent the Claimant and its interest in an expeditious proceeding according to the procedural calendar, than the Respondent, who has not convincingly proven that any inconvenience, let alone a greater one, would be caused by proceeding without a suspension.\n\nii. Suspending the proceeding would cause delay, which would in turn affect the efficiency of the proceeding and increase its costs for a benefit that the Respondent has not established.\n\niii. Absent compelling reasons, it would be procedurally improper and counter to the Tribunal's duty and objective to conduct this arbitration efficiently and effectively, to depart from the timetable that was established at the outset of the proceeding, when the Respondent was aware of, but elected not to raise, the impending decisions in *TC Energy* and *Legacy.*\n\niv. It would be unfair and prejudicial to the Claimant if, by suspending the proceeding, and in addition to the resulting delays and increased costs, the Respondent was granted substantial additional time to prepare its jurisdictional objections and/or its Counter-memorial.\n\n40.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent's request for suspension of the proceeding is unwarranted and unjustified, and therefore must be rejected.\n\n**B. Second Request for Bifurcation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal, for the following reasons, is not minded to authorize in advance a second potential request for bifurcation, or to pre-emptively rule on its admissibility, until such request is actually filed.\n\n42.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 10(1) provides:\n\n*(1) The Tribunal, or the Secretary-General if applicable, shall fix time limits for the completion of each procedural step in the proceeding, other than time limits prescribed by the Convention or these Rules.*\n\n43.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 44(1)(a)(i) provides:\n\n*(1) The following procedure shall apply with respect to a request for bifurcation relating to a preliminary objection:*\n\n*(a) unless the parties agree otherwise, the request for bifurcation shall be filed:*\n\n*(i) within 45 days after filing the memorial on the merits;*\n\n44.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 45 provides, in relevant part:\n\n*If a party does not request bifurcation of a preliminary objection within the time limits referred to in Rule 44(1)(a) or the parties confirm that they will not request bifurcation, the preliminary objection shall be joined to the merits [...].*\n\n45.\n\nIt results from a plain reading of these provisions that, absent an agreement between the Parties, the Tribunal does not have the power under the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules applicable to this proceeding, to allow a party to file a request for bifurcation beyond 45 days after the filing of the memorial on the merits.\n\n46.\n\nThe time limit set in Rule 44(1)(a)(i) is prescriptive and cannot, pursuant to Rule 10(1), be amended by the Tribunal.27 Rule 45 makes it clear that if bifurcation is not requested within the prescribed time limit, any preliminary objection shall be joined to the merits. That, alone, would dispose of the issue.\n\nThe drafting history of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules clearly shows that tribunals do have discretion to determine procedural time limits, \"*with the exception of the time limit for filing the request for bifurcation itself*\". ICSID Secretariat, \"Proposals for Amendment of the ICSID Rules \u2014 Working Paper #2\", Vol. 1 (March 2019), available at , p. 203, para. 290\n\n47.\n\nThe ICSID Arbitration Rules do not contemplate a possible second request for bifurcation of a preliminary objection. The Tribunal is inclined to consider, on the basis of the wording and purpose of Rule 44(1)(a)(i) and the arguments presented to date, that a second request for bifurcation would not be permissible under the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal may not need, however, to rule on that issue. Indeed, the Tribunal is also inclined to consider that even if a second request for bifurcation were permissible, it would still need, pursuant to Rule 44(1)(a)(i), to be filed within 45 days after the filing of the memorial on the merits. Since the Respondent seeks leave to file a second request for bifurcation beyond the timeframe established in the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules, such request could arguably be rejected on that basis.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent has not established, or even attempted to establish, that a second request for bifurcation would not be subject to or governed by Rule 44(1)(a)(i) and the Tribunal sees no reason in the ICSID Arbitration Rules to consider that that is not the case. For the sake of completeness, the \"inherent powers\" of the Tribunal under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention cannot be relied on in that respect, since the issue of bifurcation, including with respect to timing, is covered by the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n49.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent had the opportunity to either file on 5 January 2024 a request for bifurcation regarding a *ratione temporis* objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, or to decide not to request bifurcation on that basis and (if so advised at the relevant time) to raise this objection in its Counter-memorial.\n\n50.\n\nNot requesting bifurcation is certainly the prerogative of the Respondent under the procedural strategy it follows in this proceeding, but it cannot validly be invoked to justify a modification of the applicable arbitration rules or of the procedural calendar to the detriment of the Claimant.\n\n51.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal cannot authorize at this stage the Respondent's request for leave to file a second request for bifurcation. The Tribunal, due to the obvious procedural inefficiencies that this would produce, does not welcome the prospect of the Respondent filing a second request for bifurcation within 30 days of the Tribunal rejecting its first request for bifurcation, or rejecting its bifurcated preliminary objection. The Tribunal will decide on the admissibility of a second request for bifurcation if and when the Respondent files one.\n\n52.\n\nThis is without prejudice of Respondent's ability to raise a *rationae temporis* objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in its Counter Memorial if its request for bifurcation or its preliminary objections are rejected.\n\n**C. Temporary Stay**\n---------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent's request for a temporary stay of the proceedings is premised on the fact that otherwise it would be obligated to file its request for bifurcation without knowing the Tribunal's ruling on its main request for a suspension of the proceeding.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal informed the Parties that the Respondent's request for a suspension of the proceeding was rejected on 31 December 2023, *i.e.* before the due date for its request for bifurcation. There was therefore no prejudice or procedural inconvenience for the Respondent to file its request for bifurcation on 5 January 2024, and the Tribunal notes in this respect that the Respondent has indeed filed a request for bifurcation in a timely manner.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s request for a temporary stay is therefore rejected.\n\n**D. COSTS**\n------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted and finds persuasive, at least on its face, the Claimant\u2019s position regarding the allocation of the costs incurred in relation to the Respondent\u2019s Request. The Tribunal also notes that the Respondent neither submitted observations on the issue of costs nor had an opportunity to respond to the Claimant\u2019s observations.\n\n57.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal reserves its decision regarding the allocation of costs incurred in relation to the Respondent\u2019s Request. The Parties will have an opportunity to address this issue in their costs submissions when these are due, including with respect to the impact of the Parties\u2019 procedural conduct on the allocation of costs.\n\n**IV. TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n---------------------------\n\n58.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal:\n\ni. REJECTS the Respondent\u2019s request for a suspension of the proceeding;\n\nii. DECLINES to authorize at this stage the Respondent\u2019s request for leave to file a second request for bifurcation;\n\niii. REJECTS the Respondent\u2019s request for a temporary stay of the proceeding;\n\niv. RESERVES its decision regarding the costs incurred in relation to the Respondent\u2019s requests.\n\nDate: 9 April 2024"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Application for Leave to Intervene as Non-Disputing Party)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2024-12-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Application for Leave to Intervene as Non-Disputing Party)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 4 January 2024, the Government of Qu\u00e9bec (\"**Qu\u00e9bec**\" or the \"**Applicant**\") sought permission from the Tribunal to submit a written memorial as a non-disputing party in the present proceeding (\"**Qu\u00e9bec's Application**\"), assertedly in accordance with paragraph 24.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\"). That paragraph authorized such applications to be filed in accordance with the timetable established in PO1, which set a deadline of 24 April 2024 for such applications.\n\n2.\n\nAs noted further below, the written memorial accompanying Qu\u00e9bec's Application advanced an objection to jurisdiction contending that the consent to arbitrate NAFTA claims given in Annex 14-C of the USMCA did not cover claims concerning matters post-dating the termination of the NAFTA.\n\n3.\n\nOn 5 January 2024, the Respondent filed a request for bifurcation based on jurisdictional objections that made no mention of Annex 14-C.\n\n4.\n\nOn 5 January 2024, the Claimant requested leave to submit preliminary observations regarding the admissibility of Qu\u00e9bec's Application.\n\n5.\n\nOn 10 January 2024, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 67(3), the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations on Qu\u00e9bec's Application by 19 January 2024.\n\n6.\n\nOn 19 January 2024, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of its decision not to provide any remarks on Qu\u00e9bec's Application.\n\n7.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant filed observations on Qu\u00e9bec's Application (\"**Claimant's Observations\"),** together with legal authorities CL-162 to CL-183.\n\n8.\n\nOn 26 January 2024, Qu\u00e9bec sought the Tribunal's permission to submit a concise written submission, limited to ten pages, in order to reply to the Claimant's Observations.\n\n9.\n\nOn 27 January 2024, the Claimant asked for Qu\u00e9bec's request to submit an additional response to be rejected and for the Respondent to bear the costs.\n\n10.\n\nOn 5 February 2024, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it considered itself to be sufficiently briefed on Qu\u00e9bec's request for leave to file an *amicus curiae* submission.\n\n11.\n\nOn 15 July 2024, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits and memorial on jurisdiction. The Counter-Memorial asserted a jurisdictional objection based on the scope of consent in Annex 14-C of the USMCA.\n\n12.\n\nOn 17 September 2024, Qu\u00e9bec (i) informed the Tribunal that, on 23 July 2024, an agreement was entered into with the Respondent regarding the management of this arbitration proceeding, (ii) and reiterated its request that the Tribunal declines jurisdiction to rule on Qu\u00e9bec's measures because Canada did not consent to arbitration.\n\n13.\n\nOn 6 November 2024, the Claimant filed a letter opposing Qu\u00e9bec's reiterated request.\n\n14.\n\nIn this Procedural Order, the Tribunal decides on Qu\u00e9bec's Application.\n\n**II. THE APPLICANT'S AND THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Qu\u00e9bec**\n-------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant presents itself as the government of one of the provinces of Canada, Qu\u00e9bec, one of two governments whose measures are being challenged by the Claimant in the present proceeding.1\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 2.\n\n16.\n\nThe Applicant submits that it is sovereign with respect to its exclusive competencies, that it is not subordinated to the Government of Canada, that it has not received any financial assistance from the Government of Canada in relation to this proceeding and that only the Applicant's representatives have drafted the Application. The Applicant further submits that it has no link with the Claimant.2\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 3.\n\n17.\n\nThe Applicant contends that it has an interest in the proceeding because it concerns the legality under NAFTA of certain measures it took and because of the substantial financial impact the proceeding could have, since the Claimant may try to enforce against Qu\u00e9bec any monetary award issued against Canada.3\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 4.\n\n18.\n\nThe Applicant indicates that its written submission addresses the issue of consent to arbitration under Annex 14-C to the USMCA. The Applicant further states that the written memorial submits that the Tribunal should bifurcate the proceeding, rule on its jurisdiction in a preliminary phase and decline jurisdiction on the ground of lack of the Parties' consent to arbitration.XXXX4\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 5.\n\n19.\n\nThe Applicant submits that its request for leave to submit a non-disputing party written submission should be granted because all the criteria that the Tribunal should consider under Section 6 of the Statement of NAFTA's Free Trade Commission on non-disputing party participation of 7 October 2003 (\"**FTC Statement**\") are satisfied.5 In particular, the Applicant asserts that:\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 6.\n\n(i) The non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the arbitration by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing Parties\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Applicant contends that its views on the scope of consent under Annex 14-C of the USMCA are fundamentally different from the Claimant's and that, since the Respondent had not made a submission on this issue (at the time of Qu\u00e9bec's Application), it is appropriate to consider a new perspective that differs from the Parties' positions, to provide the Tribunal with a complete digest of the issues at stake.6\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 7.\n\n(ii) The non-disputing party submission would address matters within the scope of the dispute\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the issue at stake \u2013 consent to arbitration \u2013 is a jurisdictional question inherent to any investment dispute, on which the Tribunal's jurisdiction depends, and that a NAFTA tribunal has acknowledged that non-disputing Parties' views on jurisdictional issues may be of interest.7\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 8.\n\n(iii) The non-disputing party has a significant interest in the arbitration\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that because the dispute before the Tribunal concerns the legality and legitimacy of measures implemented by Qu\u00e9bec and challenged by the Claimant, the Applicant has a direct and significant interest in the proceeding.8\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 9.\n\n(iv) There is a public interest in the subject-matter of the arbitration\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the because of the impact of the Claimant's investment project on the environment (locally and globally), on the habitat of autochthonous communities and on the ecosystems of endangered and protected species, the public interest in the subject-matter of the dispute is manifest. The Applicant further asserts that there is also a public interest in the dispute with respect to the more systemic issue of public confidence in the investor-State dispute settlement mechanisms.9\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 10.\n\n(v) The non-disputing party submission avoids disrupting the proceeding; and neither disputing party is unduly burdened or unfairly prejudiced by such submission\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Applicant submits that because a tribunal may, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(3), at any time on its own initiative consider whether a dispute is within its own competence, the filing of a written memorial by Qu\u00e9bec regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction would not be any more disrupting than if the Tribunal raised that question spontaneously. The Applicant adds that presenting such observations early on in the proceeding would arguably have a lesser disrupting effect.10\n\nQu\u00e9bec's Application dated 4 January 2024, para. 11.\n\n**B. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant objects to Qu\u00e9bec's Application. The reasons for its objection have evolved between the time it first opposed the application in January 2024 and when it renewed its opposition on 6 November 2024, after Qu\u00e9bec reiterated its Application on 17 September 2024, principally because, in the meantime, the Respondent did raise in its Counter-Memorial on the merits and memorial on jurisdiction dated 15 July 2024 a jurisdictional objection based on the *ratione temporis* scope of Annex 14-C to the USMCA. The Tribunal summarizes below the Claimant's arguments before and after such jurisdictional objection was raised.\n\n**Initial position**\n--------------------\n\n26.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimant submitted that Qu\u00e9bec's Request was in violation of the procedural calendar established in Procedural Order No. 1 and was therefore inadmissible.11\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 4-6.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant then asserted that Qu\u00e9bec's Application does not satisfy any of the applicable criteria established by the ICSID Arbitration Rules and by the FTC Statement. The Claimant submitted in that respect that the criteria established by each instrument largely overlap, the FTC Statement adding additional criteria based on the existence of a \"public interest\" in the subject-matter of the arbitration.XXXX12 Taking each criteria in turn, the Claimant made the following contentions.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 7-9.\n\n(i) The submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\n*First*, Qu\u00e9bec did not establish that the written submission it wishes to file relates to a matter that is within the scope of the dispute pending before the Tribunal. For the Claimant, because the position of the Respondent on the jurisdictional issue in question was unknown at the time of the application, the \"scope of the dispute\" as concerns jurisdiction was undefined, especially with respect to the point raised by Qu\u00e9bec.13\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 13-25.\n\n(ii) The submission would assist the Tribunal to determine a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the Parties\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\n*Second*, the Tribunal was unable, at the time of the application, to determine whether Qu\u00e9bec's position was \"different\" from that of both disputing Parties precisely because the Respondent had not yet taken any position on the jurisdictional issue in question.XXXX14\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 26-42.\n\n(iii) The non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\n*Third*, Qu\u00e9bec has not validly established that it has a significant interest in the proceeding. For the Claimant, the fact that measures adopted by Qu\u00e9bec are at issue in this proceeding does not in itself demonstrate that it has a significant interest because as a matter of international law and under the NAFTA, Canada, as the Respondent, has full responsibility to respond to claims of breach of international obligations arising of such measures. Moreover, Qu\u00e9bec is directly engaged and represented in Canada's response to the Claimant's claims so that any interest it may have in the proceeding is already being advocated and pleaded.15\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 43-60.\n\n(iv) The applicant has an affiliation, direct or indirect, with a disputing party\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\n*Fourth,* Qu\u00e9bec is already closely collaborating with the Respondent, which undermines its independence and warrants the denial of its request to intervene as an *amicus curiae.*16 The Claimant points to extensive coordination between Qu\u00e9bec and the Respondent in preparing responses to the Claimant's claims, including Qu\u00e9bec being directly copied on all procedural correspondence and submissions.17 Despite Qu\u00e9bec's assertions that it has not received financial assistance or directly consulted with the Respondent in drafting its submission,XXXX18 the Claimant argues that this claim is misleading, as their collaboration is systemic and ongoing.19 Moreover, the Claimant highlights that Qu\u00e9bec's role as a subnational government, whose actions are attributable to the Respondent, further calls into question its neutrality.20 The Claimant also emphasizes that there is no precedent for allowing a subnational entity like Qu\u00e9bec to intervene as an amicus in a NAFTA arbitration, especially when its own measures are under scrutiny, thus reinforcing the argument that Qu\u00e9bec's intervention would lack the necessary independence.21\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 61.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 66.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 63.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 64.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 68.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 69-70.\n\n(v) The issue of financial assistance is irrelevant\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\n*Fifth*, the Claimant argues that Qu\u00e9bec's claim of not receiving third-party financial support for its *amicus* submission, as required under ICSID Rule 67(2)(e), is misleading and irrelevant.22 The financial independence criterion aims to prevent undue influence from undisclosed Parties.23 While Qu\u00e9bec asserts it has not received financial or other support from third Parties, the Claimant highlights that Qu\u00e9bec benefits indirectly from extensive legal assistance provided by the Respondent's team of lawyers, which raises concerns about its actual independence.24 This indirect support, although not financial, should be considered in evaluating Qu\u00e9bec's request to intervene.25\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 71.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 72.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 73.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 74.\n\n(vi) There is no public interest in the subject-matter of the arbitration\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\n*Sixth*, the Claimant argues that Qu\u00e9bec's submission fails to meet the \"public interest\" requirement under Section B.6(d) of the FTC Statement, which is needed for third-party interventions in investor-State arbitrations.26 Qu\u00e9bec claims its interest stems from the potential economic impact of the Claimant's investment on Qu\u00e9bec and broader concerns about the legitimacy of investor-State arbitration.XXXX27 However, the Claimant contends that Qu\u00e9bec's intervention does not address any substantive legal or factual issues in the case but only concerns the interpretation of a specific provision of the USMCA. The Claimant further argues that Qu\u00e9bec's reference to the potential for conflicting decisions in other NAFTA cases is speculative and does not establish a genuine public interest. They emphasize that public interest cannot be based on generalized concerns or potential financial outcomes, as seen in other cases like *Gabriel Resources v. Romania* and *Apotex Inc. v. United States*. The Claimant concludes that Qu\u00e9bec's request is premature and lacks a specific public interest that would justify its28 intervention.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 75.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 76.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 77-82.\n\n34.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argued, based on the facts at the time of Qu\u00e9bec's Application, that Qu\u00e9bec's submission would have significantly disrupted the proceeding and imposed an undue burden on the Parties, violating ICSID Arbitration Rule 67(4) and Section B.7(a) of the FTC Statement. Qu\u00e9bec's attempt to justify its intervention by claiming that it would be less disruptive than if the Tribunal raised jurisdictional issues itself was dismissed as frivolous.29 The Claimant contended that allowing Qu\u00e9bec to raise issues not yet disputed by the actual Parties would be an abuse of the third-party submission process and would unfairly grant Qu\u00e9bec party status.30 The Claimant also argued that permitting such a submission before the Respondent's position on jurisdiction was clarified would prejudice the Claimant, as jurisdictional issues are meant to be fully addressed by the Parties, not through third-party interventions.31 Qu\u00e9bec's assertion that its submission would be \"less disruptive\" is further criticized as disingenuous, given its request to suspend proceeding and bifurcate the case to address the issue it seeks to introduce.32 Additionally, the Claimant distinguishes Qu\u00e9bec's case from past precedents, emphasizing that previous tribunals allowed third-party interventions only after the Parties had fully presented their positions.33 Finally, the Claimant concluded that Qu\u00e9bec's request failed under all relevant criteria.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 83-84.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 86-87.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 89-91.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, para. 94.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 19 January 2024, paras. 102-103.\n\n**Updated position**\n--------------------\n\n35.\n\nIn its letter dated 6 November 2024, the Claimant reiterates its objection to Qu\u00e9bec's Application, for the following reasons.\n\n36.\n\nFirst, the Claimant submits that Qu\u00e9bec's Application \"*fails to meet several key requirements of an amicus curiae submission*\", as set out in Section B.6. of the FTC Statement. The Claimants explains in that respect that:\n\ni. Qu\u00e9bec's proposed submission would not assist the Tribunal by bringing a perspective or particular knowledge that is different from that of the Respondent, because Qu\u00e9bec's perspective cannot be considered different from that of the Respondent and because Qu\u00e9bec has not demonstrated having a \"*particular knowledge or expertise regarding the scope and meaning of Annex 14-C of the USMCA that Canada would not have*.\"34\n\nii. Qu\u00e9bec does not have a \"*significant interest in the arbitration*\", because its interest cannot be different from that of Canada, \"*which bears full international responsibility for Qu\u00e9bec's actions and is representing Qu\u00e9bec in the arbitration*\".35\n\niii. \"*Qu\u00e9bec has failed to demonstrate that there is a public interest in the subject-matter of the arbitration*\". For the Claimant, Qu\u00e9bec's reference to the substantive issues at sake in the proceeding does not justify making legal submissions on a discrete jurisdictional issue separate from the merit issues of public interest.36\n\niv. \"*Qu\u00e9bec's submission would disrupt the proceeding and cause the Claimant to be \"unduly burdened\" and \"unfairly prejudiced*\" because it would provide the Respondent with two opportunities to advance the same jurisdictional objection and would force the Claimant to address it twice.37\n\nv. Qu\u00e9bec, as a constituent province of Canada, is part of the Respondent and is not independent from it. This is further evidenced by the fact that Qu\u00e9bec is collaborating closely with the Respondent's representatives in this proceeding, that five employees of the Qu\u00e9bec Government have been put forward as witnesses, and that Qu\u00e9bec and the Respondent have entered into an agreement on the management of the proceeding.38\n\nClaimant's Letter s dated 6 November 2024, p.5.\n\nClaimant's Letter s dated 6 November 2024, p.6.\n\nClaimant's Letter s dated 6 November 2024, p.6.\n\nClaimant's Letter s dated 6 November 2024, p.6.\n\nClaimant's Letter s dated 6 November 2024, pp.6-7.\n\n37.\n\nSecond, the Claimant contends that \"*even if Qu\u00e9bec could be considered as a genuine amicus curiae (quod non), Qu\u00e9bec would still lack standing to file a jurisdictional objection, or take any procedural steps in this arbitration.*\" The Claimant adds that \"*Qu\u00e9bec cannot rely on Rule 43 of the ICSID Rules, which concerns the Tribunal's discretionary power with respect to its own jurisdiction, to usurp the Respondent's otherwise expired right to request bifurcation under Rules 41 and 44 of the ICSID Rules.39\"*\n\nClaimant's Letter s dated 6 November 2024, p.7.\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n38.\n\nSection B.6. of the FTC Statement provides:\n\n6. In determining whether to grant leave to file a non-disputing party submission, the Tribunal will consider, among other things, the extent to which:\n\n(a) the non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the arbitration by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties;\n\n(b) the non-disputing party submission would address matters within the scope of the dispute;\n\n(c) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the arbitration; and\n\n(d) there is a public interest in the subject-matter of the arbitration.\n\n7. The Tribunal will ensure that:\n\n(a) any non-disputing party submission avoids disrupting the proceedings; and\n\n(b) neither disputing party is unduly burdened or unfairly prejudiced by such submissions.\n\n39.\n\nSimilarly, and even if not directly applicable in this proceeding, ICSID Arbitration Rule 67 (1) and (2) provides:\n\n(1) Any person or entity that is not a party to the dispute (\"non-disputing party\") may apply for permission to file a written submission in the proceeding. The application shall be made in the procedural language(s) used in the proceeding.\n\n(2) In determining whether to permit a non-disputing party submission, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including:\n\n(a) whether the submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;\n\n(b) how the submission would assist the Tribunal to determine a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the parties;\n\n(c) whether the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding;\n\n(d) the identity, activities, organization and ownership of the non-disputing party, including any direct or indirect affiliation between the non-disputing party, a party or a non-disputing Treaty Party; and\n\n(e) whether any person or entity will provide the non-disputing party with financial or other assistance to file the submission.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal might accept that Qu\u00e9bec could be considered as having a significant interest in the proceeding and that its proposed submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that the position advanced by Qu\u00e9bec with respect to the *ratione temporis* scope of Annex 14-C to the USMCA is similar, in both content and intended outcome, to the arguments developed by the Respondent in its Counter-memorial on the merits and memorial on jurisdiction.\n\n42.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal does not consider that Qu\u00e9bec's proposed submission would provide assistance \"*to determine a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the parties.*\"\n\n43.\n\nFurthermore, and more fundamentally, in the Tribunal's view Qu\u00e9bec cannot be considered as a non-disputing party under the FTC Statement (or ICSID Arbitration Rule 67), at least in respect of the subject-matter of its proposed submission. The Tribunal notes indeed that:\n\ni. Eight representatives of Qu\u00e9bec attended the first session of the Tribunal held on 2 August 2023;\n\nii. Qu\u00e9bec and Canada entered into an agreement regarding the management of this arbitration proceeding, with the objective to \"*defend the integrity of the Qu\u00e9bec measures at issue in this dispute\u2026*\";\n\niii. Several witnesses presented by Canada hold or have held positions of responsibility within the Government of Qu\u00e9bec or a Qu\u00e9bec public agency;\n\niv. Four representatives of Qu\u00e9bec attended the procedural hearing held on 18 December 2024;\n\nv. Representatives of Qu\u00e9bec are on the distribution list of this case and therefore receive all case-related communications;\n\nvi. Representatives of Qu\u00e9bec have access to the case's folder on Box and therefore have access to all case-related materials.\n\n44.\n\nGiven the involvement of Qu\u00e9bec's representatives through their access to all cases-related materials and communications, their attendance in all procedural sessions held in this case, the agreement with Canada regarding the management of the proceeding and the evident alignment between Canada's and Qu\u00e9bec's interests and objectives in this arbitration, it is clear to the Tribunal that Qu\u00e9bec is not an independent, non-disputing party in this proceeding.\n\n**IV. TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n---------------------------\n\n45.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects Qu\u00e9bec's Application to submit a written memorial as a non-disputing party.\n\nDate: 20 December 2024"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 7 (Decision on Centre queb\u00e9cois du droit de l\u2019environnement\u2019s Application for Leave to Intervene as Non-Disputing Party)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2024-12-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 7 (Decision on Centre queb\u00e9cois du droit de l\u2019environnement\u2019s Application for Leave to Intervene as Non-Disputing Party)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 September 2024, the *Centre queb\u00e9cois du droit de l'environnement* (the \"**CQDE**\" or the \"**Applican**t\") sought permission from the Tribunal to submit a written memorial as a non-disputing party in the present proceeding (\"**CQDE's Application**\" or \"**Application**\") in accordance with Article 24.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\"). The Application enclosed the Applicant's *Amicus Curiae* Memorial, dated of the same day.\n\n2.\n\nOn 25 October 2024, in accordance with the amended procedural calendar, the Parties filed observations on the CQDE's Request (\"**Claimant's Observations**\" and \"**Respondent's Observations**\").\n\n3.\n\nIn this Procedural Order, the Tribunal decides on the CQDE's Application.\n\n**II. THE APPLICANT'S AND THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. CQDE**\n-----------\n\n4.\n\nThe Applicant presents itself as a non-governmental organization, specifically a non-profit organization founded in 1989 under the laws of Qu\u00e9bec, offering independent and non-partisan expertise in environmental law in Qu\u00e9bec.1 It protects citizens' rights, raises public awareness about environmental protection, and participates in public consultations. Since its creation, it has submitted over 60 written submissions and legal analyses to various governmental bodies.2\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 2.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 4.\n\n5.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Applicant indicates that it has initiated several legal actions related to environmental protection and has been recognized as amicus curiae in various jurisdictions. It cites the case of *Lone Pine Resources Inc. v. Canada* (ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/2), where it was granted permission to submit a written memorial, the tribunal finding that it had a relevant interest. The Applicant contends that its Application and attached Memorial are similar to those filed in the *Lone Pine* proceeding, particularly with regard to the precautionary principle.3\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, paras. 5-8.\n\n(i) The non-contesting party is independent of the parties to the dispute.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Applicant affirms its independence in the context of the present proceeding. None of the parties to the dispute is a member of the CQDE.4 Although the CDQE enters into research contracts with governmental entities, none of these contracts is related to the subject of the current dispute. The Applicant specifies that its research is systematically published on their website.5 Although they have received funding from the government of Qu\u00e9bec for its environmental activities, this support is unrelated to the present dispute.6 The Applicant also specifies that it sometimes takes legal action against the governments of Qu\u00e9bec and Canada to defend public interest causes.7 Finally, there is no financial or other connection between the Applicant and the arbitrators.8 The Applicant also submits that it has not received any external assistance, whether financial or in any other form, for the preparation of its memorial or the Application.9\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 9.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 10.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 11.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 12.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 13.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 14.\n\n(ii) The non-disputing party has a significant interest in the arbitration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Applicant argues that it has a direct interest in the present dispute, as the legal issues raised concern environmental protection, particularly in the areas of climate change and biodiversity, which are at the core of its priorities and expertise.10 The Applicant has actively participated in public debates regarding the disputed project, by intervening with the Canadian Impact Assessment Agency and submitting several briefs during the public consultations on the project. These actions demonstrate its commitment to environmental issues and strengthen its interest in the legal aspects of the dispute at hand.11\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 15.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 16.\n\n(iii) The submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Applicant wishes to intervene on the issues already in dispute, without introducing new matters. It will focus on the precautionary principle in environmental law, explaining why the measures in dispute comply with this principle. Its position, based on considerations that are different yet complementary to those of the Respondent, will not raise any additional issues.12\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 17.\n\n(iv) The submission would assist the Tribunal to determine a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the Parties\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Applicant argues that its submission will assist the Tribunal in resolving the factual and legal issues related to the proceeding by providing a perspective different from that of the Parties, particularly regarding the precautionary principle, which has not been addressed by them.13 The submission discusses the fundamental aspects of the dispute, including the legitimacy and consistency of the decisions made in the context of the environment, particularly with regard to protection against greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the conservation of biodiversity.14\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, paras. 18-19.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 20.\n\n10.\n\nThe Applicant, whose mission is focused on the public interest and environmental protection, emphasizes that the outcome of this dispute could have a major impact on environmental policy, creating a \"chilling effect\" if the Tribunal concludes that the decisions of the governments of Canada and Qu\u00e9bec were unreasonable or illegitimate.15 Such a decision could reduce the political will to take environmental protection measures, which would negatively affect the public interest.16\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 21.\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 21.\n\n11.\n\nThe Applicant also asserts that its intervention, limited to the submission of a memorial and without oral arguments, will not disrupt the proceeding or delay the timeline set by the Tribunal. The intervention will therefore not impose any additional burden or prejudice on the Parties.17\n\nCQDE's Application dated 25 September 2024, para. 22.\n\n**B. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n(i) The submission would not bring a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the Parties to the dispute\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the CQDE's request should be rejected under Article B(6) of the NAFTA Commission's Declaration on the Participation of Non-Disputing Parties, as the memorial proposed by the CQDE would not contribute usefully to the arbitration.18 According to the Claimant, the CQDE provides no perspective, knowledge, or insight distinct from that of the Respondent, particularly regarding the precautionary principle, which has already been addressed by the Respondent in the course of the proceeding.19\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 25 October 2024, para. 2.\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 25 October 2024, para. 3.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the CQDE's arguments on issues such as the impact of the LNGQ and Gazoduq projects on the energy transition, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the beluga population are largely similar to those of the Respondent. Therefore, the CQDE's submission would not add any value in terms of new perspectives and would not significantly contribute to the determination of the legal issues in the dispute.20\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 25 October 2024, paras. 4-5.\n\n14.\n\nFinally, although the Claimant opposes the CQDE's request for intervention, they respectfully submit to the Tribunal's decision regarding the admission of the CQDE's submission.21\n\nClaimant's Observations dated 25 October 2024, para. 6.\n\nC.**Respondent**\n----------------\n\n15.\n\nFrom the outset, the Respondent expresses its support for transparency and openness in arbitration proceedings, emphasizing that the participation of *amici curiae,* such as the CQDE, contributes to the legitimacy of investor-state arbitration processes and promotes greater public acceptance of these mechanisms.22\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 25 October 2024, p. 1.\n\n(i) The submission of the non-disputing party provides a perspective, specific knowledge, or insight distinct from that of the parties to the dispute.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the CQDE's request meets the criteria outlined in Procedural Order No. 1 and the NAFTA Commission's Declaration. These criteria include the requirement for the memorial to address issues relevant to the dispute, provide a distinct perspective, and raise public interest issues. The Respondent believes that the CQDE's request fully satisfies these conditions.23\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 25 October 2024, p. 1.\n\n17.\n\nThe CQDE's memorial addresses issues directly related to the subject of the dispute, particularly the application of the precautionary principle, which is central to the decisions made by the governments of Canada and Qu\u00e9bec regarding the *\u00c9nergie Saguenay* project. The memorial examines how this principle influenced the environmental impact assessments of the project, particularly with regard to the energy transition, GHG emissions, and the protection of belugas. These elements are essential to understanding the legal framework of the decisions in question.24\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 25 October 2024, p. 1.\n\n18.\n\nFurthermore, the CQDE's memorial offers a unique perspective by detailing the role of the precautionary principle in assessing environmental risks, which has not been addressed by the parties to the dispute. This will provide valuable insights to the Tribunal in resolving the legal and factual issues related to the arbitration.25\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 25 October 2024, p. 2.\n\n(ii) The non-disputing party has a significant interest in the arbitration.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the CQDE, as an environmental organization, has a direct and legitimate interest in this arbitration due to its role in defending environmental principles. This dispute, which concerns decisions to reject the *\u00c9nergie Saguenay* project for environmental protection and climate change reasons, raises major public interest issues, justifying the participation of the CQDE.26\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 25 October 2024, p. 2.\n\n(iii) There is a public interest in the subject-matter of the arbitration\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn light of these elements, Canada requests that the Tribunal favorably consider the request made by the CQDE. The participation of the CQDE would provide a valuable contribution to the proceeding by offering legal and environmental perspectives essential to guiding the Tribunal's decisions on public interest matters.27\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 25 October 2024, p. 2.\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nSection B.6. of the Statement of the Free Trade Commission on non-disputing party participation dated 7 October 2003, provides:\n\n6. In determining whether to grant leave to file a non-disputing party submission, the Tribunal will consider, among other things, the extent to which:\n\n(a) the non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the arbitration by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties;\n\n(b) the non-disputing party submission would address matters within the scope of the dispute;\n\n(c) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the arbitration; and\n\n(d) there is a public interest in the subject-matter of the arbitration.\n\n7. The Tribunal will ensure that:\n\n(a) any non-disputing party submission avoids disrupting the proceedings; and\n\n(b) neither disputing party is unduly burdened or unfairly prejudiced by such submissions.\n\n22.\n\nSimilarly, and even if not directly applicable in this proceeding, ICSID Arbitration Rule 67 (1) and (2) provides:\n\n(1) Any person or entity that is not a party to the dispute (\"non-disputing party\") may apply for permission to file a written submission in the proceeding. The application shall be made in the procedural language(s) used in the proceeding.\n\n(2) In determining whether to permit a non-disputing party submission, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including:\n\n(a) whether the submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;\n\n(b) how the submission would assist the Tribunal to determine a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the parties;\n\n(c) whether the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding;\n\n(d) the identity, activities, organization and ownership of the non-disputing party, including any direct or indirect affiliation between the non-disputing party, a party or a non-disputing Treaty Party; and\n\n(e) whether any person or entity will provide the non-disputing party with financial or other assistance to file the submission.\n\n23.\n\nIt is not disputed, and the Tribunal is satisfied, that the Applicant's proposed submission addresses a matter within the scope of the dispute, that the CDQE has a significant interest in the proceeding and that it exists and operates independently from the Parties to the dispute.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that the Applicant's proposed submission would provide assistance in determining a *\"factual or legal issue related to the arbitration by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties*\".\n\n25.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal has noted that the Parties' submissions to date have addressed only briefly the precautionary principle, on which the Applicant proposes to opine and provide its views. The Tribunal is interested in, and would be assisted by, the Applicant's perspective and insights on this topic.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted that the Applicant's **proposed** submission was filed together with its Application, that its scope is limited and its length is reasonable. The Tribunal therefore considers that the Applicant's proposed submission would not disrupt the proceeding, nor would it unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either Party.\n\n**IV. TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n---------------------------\n\n27.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal grants the CQDE's Application to submit a written memorial as a non-disputing party, and accepts the CQDE's Amicus Curiae Memorial dated 25 September 2024 into the record of this proceeding.\n\nDate: 20 December 2024"}]}
