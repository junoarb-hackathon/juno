further and as a consequence:\n\n(a) Turkey shall refrain from engaging in any conduct that may directly or indirectly affect the legal or physical integrity of the Targeted Individuals for Criminal Proceedings and shall further provide suitable and humane conditions for Mr Tekin Ipek in prison, including allowing him to work with Turkish and/or foreign attorneys in confidence and enabling him to provide witness testimony in this Arbitration;\n\n(b) Turkey shall cease any further appropriation or dissipation of the assets of or companies within the Koza Group;\n\n(c) Turkey shall cease any interference with or destruction of value of the Koza Group or IIL\u2019s legal rights under the BIT; and\n\n(5) Turkey shall preserve the following categories of documents relevant to this Arbitration under the control of any company within the Koza Group or any associated individuals or entities;\n\n(a) Documents relating to the Comakli Report;\n\n(b) Documents relating to the claim that Koza-Ipek Holding had supported the alleged terrorist organisation, FETO;\n\n(c) Documents relating to the transfer of management of Koza Holding\u2019s business to the United Kingdom;\n\n(d) Documents relating to the SPA;\n\n(e) Documents relating to the seizure, closure, and/or sale of the Koza Media Companies and any of their assets;\n\n(f) Documents relating to the value of Claimant\u2019s investment in Turkey, including but not limited to accounting and financial documents for each of the companies in the Koza Group, balance sheets, board minutes and decisions, documents relating to any sale or potential sale of company assets, documents relating to the retention or instruction of consultants to assist in the sale or potential sale of any Koza Group assets; and\n\n(g) Documents relating to the management of the Koza Group by the Trustees and the SDIF since October 2015, including but not limited to accounting and financial documents, subcontractor or operator agreements, and amendments to or variations of agreements that were in place when the Trustees were appointed. Such documents may include, for example, the documents relating to the agreement between Ipek Natural Resources and Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi (\"Turkish Petroleum\").6\n\nReply, [23].\n\nReply, [31].\n\nReply, [67].\n\n*Legal Principles*\n------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to grant provisional measures derives from Art 47 of the Convention, which provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n3.\n\nBy ratifying the Convention, a State accepts that a tribunal may grant provisional measures in an appropriate case even if that may entail some interference with a State\u2019s sovereign powers and enforcement duties.7\n\n*Burlington Resources Orients Ltd v Ecuador* (Procedural Order No 1) ICSID Case No ARB/08/5 (29 June 2009) CL-3, [66].\n\n4.\n\nArticle 47 is supplemented by Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules, paragraph 1 of which provides:\n\nAt any time after the institution of proceedings, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n5.\n\nThere is no provision in the BIT8 that restricts the Tribunal\u2019s power to recommend provisional measures.\n\nUnited Kingdom-Turkey Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (signed 15 March 1991, entered into force 22 October 1996) UKTS 1997 No 13 (\"BIT\") **RfA Ex 1.**\n\n6.\n\nIn order to advance an application for provisional measures, the Claimant must establish a *prima facie* case that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the substance of the claim and as to the merits of the claim.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal 'need not go beyond whether a reasonable case has been made which, if the facts alleged are proven, might possibly lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that an award could be made in favor of Claimants.\u20199 As the Tribunal put it in *Paushok v Mongolia,* the Tribunal 'needs to decide only that the claims made are not, on their face, frivolous or obviously outside the competence of the Tribunal.\u201910 This approach is also supported by the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice.11\n\n*Paushok v Mongolia* (Order on Interim Measures) UNCITRAL (2 September 2008) **RL-55,** [55].\n\nIbid.\n\nSee, e.g. *Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v* Costa *Rica)* (Provisional Measures Order) [2013] ICJ Rep 398, [15]-[16].\n\n8.\n\nProvided the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has established a *prima facie* case, the Claimant must make out the following grounds:12\n\n(1) The possession by the Claimants of rights requiring protection;\n\n(2) That the provisional measures are urgent;\n\n(3) That the provisional measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm; and\n\n(4) That the provisional measures are proportionate.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd v Ecuador* (Decision on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6 *(Perenco),* (8 May 2009) **RL-56,** [43], [55].\n\n9.\n\nThe concept of 'rights' requiring protection denotes that:13\n\nThe rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party\u2019s ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be carried out. Thus the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party\u2019s claims and requests for relief. They may be general rights, such as the rights to due process or the right not to have the dispute aggravated, but those general rights must be related to the specific disputes in the arbitration, which, in turn, are defined by the Claimant\u2019s claims and requests for relief to date.\n\n*Plama Consortium Ltd. (Cyprus) v Bulgaria,* (Order on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, (6 September 2005) **CL-16,** [40].\n\n10.\n\nThe concept of necessity to 'avoid irreparable harm\u2019 is, as both Parties agreed, 'properly understood as requiring a showing of material risk or serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally \"irreparable\" in what is sometimes regarded as the narrow common law sense of the term.'14\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v Papua New Guinea,* (Decision on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33 (21 January 2015) **CL-17,** [109]-[110].\n\n11.\n\nWhere the provisional measures concern the effect of the exercise of a State\u2019s powers of criminal investigation and prosecution upon the tribunal\u2019s own process, the tribunal must balance the duties on the parties of good faith and the objective of the non-aggravation of the dispute whilst bearing in mind the need to minimise any intervention in the right of the State to act in the public interest:\n\n[A]ny party to an arbitration should adhere to some procedural duties, including to conduct itself in good faith; moreover, one can expect from a State to adhere in that very capacity, to at least the same principles and standards, in particular to desist from any conduct in this Arbitration that would be incompatible with the Parties\u2019 duty of good faith, to respect equality and not to aggravate the dispute. But this Tribunal must be mindful when issuing provisional measures not to unduly encroach on the State\u2019s sovereignty and activities serving public interests.15\n\n*Caratube International Oil Co LLP* v *Kazakhstan (Caratube II)* (Decision on Provisional Measures) ICSID ARB/13/13 (4 December 2014), **RL-100,** [121].\n\n12.\n\nThe institution of criminal proceedings does not in itself threaten the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings:\n\nCriminal proceedings deal with criminal liability and not with investment disputes, and fall by definition outside the scope of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT contain any rule enjoining the State from exercising criminal jurisdiction, nor do they exempt suspected criminals from prosecution by virtue of their being investors.16\n\n*Quiborax SA V Bolivia* (Decision on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No ARB/06/2 (26 February 2010) **CL-18**, [129].\n\n13.\n\nIn order to obtain provisional measures in relation to criminal proceedings, the claimant has to establish that the criminal proceedings were preventing them from asserting their rights in the arbitration, causing them irreparable and imminent harm requiring urgent relief. The claimant must also establish \u2018that there is no higher or equivalent public interest of the State to be a party to the criminal proceedings.\u201917\n\n*Caratube II* [135]; *Hydro Srl v Albania* (Order on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No ARB/15/28 (3 March 2006) **CL-11.**\n\n*Nature of the provisional measures sought*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn the present case, the provisional measures sought by the Claimant fall into four broad categories:\n\n(1) Measures of protection from criminal proceedings : Requests (1), (2) and (4)(a) relate to the alleged effect on the present arbitration of pending criminal proceedings in Turkey against a number of persons associated with the Claimant, whether as witnesses or shareholders;\n\n(2) Measures to restrain the pursuit of related civil proceedings : Request (3) concerns the pursuit of civil proceedings in the courts in Turkey that are alleged to be related to the arbitration;\n\n(3) Measures for the protection of assets : Request (4)(b) & (c) seeks the preservation of the assets of the Koza Group from disposal or dissipation pending the Tribunal\u2019s Award;\n\n(4) Measures for the preservation of documents: Request (5) concerns the preservation of documents relevant to the issues in dispute in the arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nIn view of the fact that each of these four categories of measures engages distinct considerations, the Tribunal will consider each of them separately. Before it does so, however, there is a preliminary issue that is common to the Application as a whole. That is the question of *prima facie* case. The Tribunal turns to this issue first.\n\n*A prima facie case*\n--------------------\n\n16.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already observed above, one of the requirements for the grant of provisional measures is that the Claimant has established a *prima facie* case both as to jurisdiction and the merits.\n\n17.\n\nIn the present case, however, the application of this factor is affected by the procedural positions taken by the Parties:\n\n(1) In the First Session on 10 November 2018, the Claimant had already intimated that it would shortly make its application for provisional measures, and both Parties agreed a pleading and hearing timetable for its disposition, including by way of a hearing in July 2019;18\n\n(2) At the same time, the Parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings so as to enable the question of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction to be determined prior to the merits.19\n\n(3) The pleading and hearing schedule for the jurisdictional phase contemplated a written phase that would run concurrently with the briefing of the provisional measures application with a hearing on preliminary objections in June 2020.\n\n(4) By virtue of this agreement, all proceedings on the merits were suspended until the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction, with the consequence that the Claimant is not during this initial phase called upon to file its Memorial on the Merits.\n\nPO No 1, [24.1].\n\n[14.1].\n\n18.\n\nAt the First Session, the Respondent did not dispute the Claimant\u2019s entitlement to bring its provisional measures application. Nor did it make an application under Rule 41(5) for a prompt decision from the Tribunal that the claim was \"manifestly without legal merit.\"\n\n19.\n\nUnder this agreed timetable, the Tribunal will determine in June 2020, on the basis of the full evidentiary record then before it, the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. If that hearing were to lead to the dismissal of the claim, it would necessarily follow that provisional measures ordered in the interim would also be set aside. The question before the Tribunal at present is whether any measures are required to maintain the status quo or to protect its process in the interim, in order to enable it to decide the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections.\n\n20.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, it would be inconsistent with the procedure agreed between the Parties for the Respondent to contest the present application on the ground that the Tribunal lacks *prima facie* jurisdiction, still less to prejudge the merits of the claim.\n\n21.\n\nNo doubt for this reason, the Respondent confined itself in its written pleadings to a submission that the Tribunal should take the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections into account such that \"the Tribunal must approach the Application with appropriate rigor, as an application for an exceptional and extraordinary remedy which should not be granted lightly.\"20\n\nResponse, [23]; Rejoinder, [8]-[12].\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal certainly agrees that an application for provisional measures, particularly one that relates to criminal proceedings, is one that must be approached with appropriate rigour.\n\n23.\n\nIn response to questions from the Tribunal at the hearing, the Respondent\u2019s counsel confirmed:21\n\nSo we don\u2019t ask you to decide jurisdiction today, and we don\u2019t come here saying, \"You can\u2019t give this relief because you have no jurisdiction\". We don\u2019t do either of these things.\n\nT1/72/22-25.\n\n24.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal approaches the present Request on the basis that it is not asked to determine jurisdiction, nor is it disentitled to order provisional measures on grounds that there is no *prima facie* basis for jurisdiction.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant has advanced a serious claim in its Request for Arbitration dated 9 May 2018, and has invoked an arguable basis for jurisdiction under the BIT. The Respondent has for its part advanced a substantial objection to the jurisdiction in its Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 12 April 2019, to which the Claimant has, since the hearing on provisional measures now filed its Defence on 5 September 2019.\n\n26.\n\nAt the heart of both the Claimant\u2019s claim to jurisdiction and the Respondent\u2019s objection is the validity of the Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), which the Claimant alleges it entered into on 7 June 2015.22 This forms the basis for the Claimant\u2019s claim to be a \"company\" incorporated in the United Kingdom that has made an \"investment\" in Turkey within the meaning of the BIT;23 and \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purpose of the ICSID Convention.24\n\nRfA Ex 4.\n\nArts 1(a) & 1(d)(ii) BIT\n\nArt 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention.\n\n27.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent alleges that the SPA is a sham, which provides no basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and that the Claimant's claim is an abuse of process, violating the universal requirement of good faith.25\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections Memorial (12 April 2019).\n\n28.\n\nThe validity *vel non* of that ground for jurisdiction will, by agreement of both Parties, fall to be determined next year on the hearing of all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction.\n\n29.\n\nIt would be inconsistent with this procedural posture and would prejudge the issues that both Parties have submitted for decision in the jurisdiction phase, for the Tribunal to make any further finding on jurisdiction or the merits at this stage.\n\n30.\n\nHaving clarified this initial question, it is now possible to move to consider each of the Claimant\u2019s four categories of provisional measures and to assess the grounds for each in light of the four requirements outlined in paragraph [8] above.\n\n*Measures of protection from criminal proceedings*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant seeks three types of interim protection from criminal proceedings:\n\n(1) First, it seeks an order that Turkey suspend or refrain from seeking the extradition of the Targeted Individuals for Extradition (Request (1));\n\n(2) Second, it seeks the suspension of criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals for Criminal Proceedings (Request (2)); and,\n\n(3) Third, it seeks the protection of the legal and physical integrity of the Targeted Individuals for Criminal Proceedings and in particular the provision of humane conditions for Mr Tekin Ipek in order to enable him to prepare for and give evidence in this arbitration (Request (4)(a)).\n\nIt will be convenient to take each of these requests *seriatim.*\n\n*Targeted Individuals for Extradition*\n--------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nBy the first limb of its Request, the Claimant seeks a provisional measure from this Tribunal that would recommend to Turkey that it take all necessary measures to suspend or refrain from initiating extradition proceedings against the Targeted Individuals for Extradition.\n\n33.\n\nThe named persons fall into three categories:\n\n(1) Mr Akin Ipek, the Director of the Claimant, its Party Representative and a witness in these proceedings;\n\n(2) Three witnesses, Mr Yurttas (former President of the Koza Media Group), Mr Erhan Basyurt (former Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper division of Koza Media) and Mr Tarik Toros (former Executive Producer of the radio and television division of Koza Media);26 and,\n\n(3) Two members of the Ipek family who are shareholders in the Claimant: Ms Pelin Zenginer (Mr Akin Ipek\u2019s sister) and Ms Nevin Ipek (Mr Akin Ipek\u2019s wife), but who do not intend to testify in these proceedings.27\n\nMr Yurttas filed a witness statement and gave oral testimony at the hearing on provisional measures. Claimant's counsel confirmed that Mr Basyurt and Mr Toros are willing to tesify for the Claimant: T3/37/12- **1** 3.\n\nT3/37/25-38/2.\n\n34.\n\nProtection from extradition from the United Kingdom to Turkey was at the forefront of the Claimant\u2019s original Request on 15 November 2018. Mr Akin Ipek, the Claimant\u2019s director, had been the subject of an extradition request from Turkey dated 2 February 2017.28 A UK arrest warrant was issued on 2 May 2018,29 and Mr Ipek was arrested on 23 May 2018. A full hearing was held in the Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on 25 September 2018. Judgment was still awaited when the Claimant filed its Request with this Tribunal.\n\n**C-16.**\n\n**C-36.**\n\n35.\n\nDistrict Judge Zani gave judgment on 28 November 2018 (\"Extradition Judgment\").30 The learned judge refused the request for extradition on the grounds that the decision to prosecute was politically motivated and that, if returned there was a real risk that the defendant would be subject in prison to inhumane conditions. He discharged Mr Ipek.\n\n**CL-29.**\n\n36.\n\nTurkey applied to the High Court for permission to appeal the Extradition Judgment, which application was rejected on 5 March 2019.31 It renewed its application to the Court of Appeal, which also rejected it on 9 April 2019.32 Counsel for the Claimant confirmed at the hearing that the result is that the Extradition Judgment is final and that \"those proceedings can go no further lawfully in the UK.\"33\n\n**C-98.**\n\nAgreed Chronology of Key Events, 11.\n\nT1/23/13-15.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant maintains its request for provisional measures under this head.\n\n38.\n\nIt submits that Turkey continues to seek the apprehension of Mr Akin Ipek and others of the Targeted Individuals for Extradition:\n\n(1) On 14 March 2019, the Prosecutor requested the Ankara Heavy Criminal Court to inquire into the status of the red bulletin for Mr Akin Ipek and Mr Yurttas;34\n\n(2) At the same hearing, the Court executed a warrant of apprehension against Mr Ipek, Ms Nevin Ipek and Ms Pelin Zenginer;35\n\n(3) On 9 April 2019, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced the continuation of its efforts to extradite alleged Giilenists;36\n\n(4) Documentation for an extradition request for Mr Yurttas is still in preparation, having been remitted by the Turkish Extradition Bureau for redrafting on 11 June 2019.37\n\n**C-100.**\n\n**C-100.**\n\n**C-103.**\n\n**R-177.**\n\n39.\n\nIn their post-hearing submissions, the Parties pleaded further as to the consequences of a hearing in the Heavy Criminal Court on 6 August 2019, a transcript of which has been supplied to the Tribunal.38 It appears from this record that:\n\n(1) The Prosecutor requested the issue of red notices for Ms Nevin Ipek and Ms Pelin Zenginer, but the Court made no ruling on this request, deciding to \"wait for the execution of apprehension decisions\" in respect of those persons;39\n\n(2) The Prosecutor enquired as to the status of the red notices against Mr Akin Ipek and Mr Yurttas, but the Court decided to \"wait for the execution of apprehension decisions\" in respect of those persons.40\n\nAnnex 3 to Respondent\u2019s submission of 29 August 2019.\n\nIbid, 97, 99.\n\nIdem.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent confirmed at the hearing and subsequently that \"there is no extant, existing red notice against Mr Ipek\"41 and that \"there is no extradition request which was conveyed to the foreign public authorities\" about the Targeted Individuals for Extradition.42\n\nT3/73/1-2.\n\nMemorandum from Extradition Bureau dated 19 July 2019. Annex 4 to Respondent's submission of 29 August 2019.\n\n41.\n\n*Tribunal's analysis:* The present Tribunal is constituted solely to determine the Claimant\u2019s claim that the Respondent has breached the BIT by expropriating its assets in Turkey and failing to protect its investment in accordance with the Treaty provisions. Accordingly, its power to grant provisional measures under this head is limited to measures urgently necessary to ensure a fair trial of the claims that are before it.\n\n42.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this ground would be engaged were persons with relevant evidence to provide to the Tribunal to be extradited so that they were not reasonably able to give that evidence. This is also the case for a Party\u2019s representative, whose presence is also required in order for him to be able to instructions as to the conduct of the claim. This ground may also be engaged if it were sought to intimidate a party representative or a key witness from prosecuting the claim or giving evidence through the pursuit of extradition measures against a close member of his or her family.\n\n43.\n\nNevertheless, a tribunal will not exercise its powers in this respect where the alleged risk is only a potential one. It must be imminent.43\n\n*Burlington Resources Oriente Ltd v Ecuador* (Procedural Order No 1) ICSID Case No ARB/08/5 (29 June 2009) **CL-3,** [45].\n\n44.\n\nThere is no extant extradition request against any of the Targeted Individuals for Extradition. The only request that had been issued to a foreign state, namely the request to the United Kingdom in respect of Mr Akin Ipek, was dismissed by the English court.\n\n45.\n\nOn the current state of the evidence, the Tribunal does not consider that the steps taken by the criminal authorities in Turkey in respect of the apprehension of the Targeted Individuals are such as to meet the test of imminence justifying the issue of an order.\n\n46.\n\nNevertheless, while it is hearing and determining this case, the Tribunal would treat very seriously any attempt to seek the extradition to Turkey of persons who are responsible for the direction of the Claimant\u2019s case or who have relevant evidence to provide or to intimidate such persons through the pursuit of extradition requests against their close family members.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal remains seised of this element of the request. The Claimant has leave to move the Tribunal on an urgent basis in the event that there were a material change in the position.\n\n*Targeted individuals for criminal proceedings*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nBy the second limb of its Request, the Claimant seeks a provisional measure from this Tribunal that would recommend to Turkey that it suspend or refrain from pursuing further criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals for Criminal Proceedings.\n\n49.\n\nThe named persons fall into four categories:\n\n(1) The Targeted Individuals for Extradition (described above at [33]);\n\n(2) A further witness and shareholder in the Claimant, Mr Tekin Ipek, who is currently under arrest in Turkey;\n\n(3) Two further members of the Ipek family: Ms Melek Ipek (Mr Akin Ipek\u2019s mother) and Ms Ebru Ipek (Mr Tekin Ipek\u2019s wife);\n\n(4) Five former lawyers for the Koza Group, who are possible witnesses: Ms Efsun Unal, Mr Ali Yildiz, Mr Hakan Yildiz, Mr Mehmet Rasim Kuseyri, and Mr Muhammet Gokhan Kilic.44\n\nClaimant's counsel stated at the hearing that an order from the Tribunal \"would greatly assist, but I can give you no assurance that any of those people would be prepared to testify.\" T3/36/19-20.\n\n50.\n\nAll of these persons are the subject of criminal indictments in Turkey or are alleged to be under criminal investigation in pursuance of such indictments.45\n\nAnkara High Criminal Court Indictment No 2016/1632 (6 June 2016) **R-85** ; Ankara High Criminal Court Indictment No 2017/3386 (9 June 2017) **R-21** ; Ankara High Criminal Court Indictment No 2017/3425 (14 June 2017) **HAI-8** (in respect of Mr Ali Yildiz, Mr Hakan Yildiz, Mr Mehmet Rasim Kuseyri, and Mr Muhammet Gokhan Kilic, former Koza group lawyers); Ankara Heavy Criminal Court Indictment No 2018/713 (25 October 2018) **C-0086.** Claimant further submits that Mr Toros and Mr Basyurt are not indicted, but are referred to in the Indictments as having been referred to the Public Prosecutor for investigation: Reply, [29] n 81, citing **R-21,** 390, 515.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimant seeks the suspension of the criminal process in Turkey pending the outcome of this arbitration on the ground that further pursuit of the criminal proceedings threatens the integrity of this arbitration and disturbs the status quo:\n\n(1) by inhibiting actual or potential witnesses from giving relevant testimony; or\n\n(2) by chilling the pursuit of the arbitration through the use of criminal proceedings as reprisals.46\n\nT1/40/15-18.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it faces what it regards as a serious terrorist threat. It has a sovereign right to pursue criminal proceedings against those persons whom it considers perpetrated or assisted in terrorist offences and must not be prevented from exercising that right.47 It points out that the criminal indictments were brought well before the commencement of the arbitration, so provisional measures are not necessary to protect the status quo. In any event, the Request does not meet the high threshold that both Parties agree must be met before any provisional measure may be ordered in respect of criminal proceedings.\n\nRejoinder, [71]-[80]; T1/50-61.\n\n53.\n\n*Tribunal's analysis:* Summarising the effect of the authorities cited at paragraphs [11]-[13] above, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n(1) It has jurisdiction to grant provisional measures in relation to the effect of the exercise of a State\u2019s criminal law powers upon its own process;\n\n(2) The right that is engaged is the right of both Parties before it to a fair process. No question of the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings is engaged in this context, since the arbitral process established under the ICSID Convention applies to investment disputes not to criminal process as such, which is the preserve of the State;\n\n(3) Nevertheless, within the framework of the protection of the fairness of its own process, an ICSID Tribunal is entitled to consider in particular cases the effect of the pursuit of a criminal proceeding on the ability of a party to seek recourse under the ICSID Convention, including to present relevant evidence in support of its case;\n\n(4) An applicant must meet a high threshold in establishing the requirements for the grant of provisional measures in relation to criminal proceedings; and,\n\n(5) In considering whether the measures are proportionate, the Tribunal must also bear in mind the need to minimise any intervention in the ability of the State to exercise its criminal law powers in the public interest.\n\n54.\n\nA further preliminary remark is warranted at this stage. The Tribunal heard submissions from counsel for both Parties as to the character of the Turkish criminal proceedings. It also heard some oral evidence from Mr Ipek and Mr Yurtass for the Claimant and from Mr G\u00fclen for the Respondent, and expert evidence from Professor Sir Jeffrey Jowell.\n\n55.\n\nThe position of the Claimant is that the criminal charges against the Targeted Individuals are baseless and that the criminal proceedings are politically motivated. For its part, the Respondent alleges that Mr Akin Ipek and the other persons charged in Turkey are terrorists against whom it is fully entitled to take all measures within the framework of the criminal law.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal is in no position now to make findings of fact about any of these wider allegations. It would not do so without the benefit of a full trial and in any event will only consider such allegations of criminal conduct as may properly be relevant and admissible as evidence in relation to the claims of expropriation and other breaches of treaty advanced in the present proceedings. This necessarily follows from the fact that, as already observed, it is an international investment tribunal not a criminal court.\n\n57.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal is not concerned with the pursuit of criminal proceedings against persons who are unconnected to the present Claimant or its claim. It is necessary to make this point expressly, because the Indictments take the form of an omnibus set of charges against many persons other than those named in the Request before this Tribunal.\n\n58.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal does find, on the basis of the case as pleaded, that there is a connection between the criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals and the present claim. Acts of the Respondent that the Claimant alleges in its Request for Arbitration gave rise to the expropriation and other breaches of the BIT were allegedly precipitated or carried out in the context of the criminal investigation and proceedings.48\n\nRfA, [8], [41]-[50].\n\n59.\n\nThe only question that is currently before the Tribunal under this head is whether the continued pursuit of the criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals during the pendency of the present arbitration is so likely to inhibit the fair process of this arbitration that the grant of provisional measures is urgently necessary to prevent irreparable harm. This does not require the Tribunal to make an assessment of the evidentiary strength of the criminal charges and it does not do so.\n\n60.\n\nit further follows that, in analysing this question, it is not dispositive that the criminal proceedings were commenced prior to this arbitration. It is correct that, as the Respondent submitted, an inquiry into timing is inherent in an application for provisional measures to preserve the status quo. The Tribunal accepts that in the present case the whole criminal process cannot be characterised as a response or reprisal for the bringing the arbitration. At the same time, it rejects the broader Respondent\u2019s argument that the object of preserving the status quo cannot be engaged. The Tribunal is not concerned with the pendency of criminal charges against the Targeted Individuals. It is concerned solely with steps that may be taken subsequent to its Order that may affect the fairness of its procedure.\n\n61.\n\nThis is a factor that has led tribunals to grant provisional measures in relation to criminal proceedings in other cases:\n\n(1) In *Ouiborax v Bolivia,* the tribunal decided to order the suspension of criminal proceedings. It took into account in particular \"the effect that the criminal proceedings may have on potential witnesses.\"49 The tribunal was also in that case concerned that the underlying motivation for the criminal charges may have been the connection of the relevant individuals to the arbitration.\n\n(2) In *Lao Holdings v Lao,* the tribunal decided to suspend the criminal proceedings. It found that the proposed criminal investigation \"strikes directly at the people and issues involved in the arbitration\" which would be \"highly disruptive of the Claimant\u2019s ability to prepare and present its case.\"50\n\n(3) In *Hydro v Albania,* the tribunal recommended the suspension of criminal proceedings. It found that the pendency of criminal proceedings (which included a request for extradition and possible incarceration) against the central person on the claimants\u2019 side would represent \"a grave concern to the procedural integrity of the proceeding.\"51 It was proper for the tribunal to intervene as the alleged offences were related to the subject matter of the arbitration. The measures were necessary in order to protect the ability of the claimants to put their cases adequately and participate in the arbitration. The measure was proportionate as the stay would not prevent the subsequent prosecution of the criminal proceedings. It would merely stay them pending the outcome of the arbitration.\n\n*Ouiborax SA v Bolivia* (Decision on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No ARB/06/2 (26 February 2010) **CL-****18,** [143].\n\n*Lao Holdings NV v Lao* (Ruling on Motion to Amend Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/12/6 (30 May 2014) **CL-13,** [72].\n\n*Hydro Srl v Albania* (Order on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No ARB/15/28 (3 March 2006) **CL-11,****[3.18].**\n\n62.\n\nIn considering whether the Request for provisional measures is well founded in the present case, the Tribunal has paid particularly close attention to the current procedural status of the criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals in Turkey. As this was the subject of developments subsequent to the hearing at the end of July 2019, the Tribunal allowed the Parties two further rounds of pleadings concerning events in the criminal proceedings in August 2019.52\n\nAbove Preamble (10)-(12).\n\n63.\n\nThere was some disagreement between the Parties as to the proper characterisation of these events. The Tribunal now has before it a full translation of the hearing in the Ankara Heavy Criminal Court on 6 August 2019.53\n\nAnnex 3 to Respondent\u2019s submission of 29 August 2019, and see above at [39].\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal makes the following findings of fact as to the current status of the criminal proceedings on the basis of the evidentiary record now before it:\n\n(1) The criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals were commenced notably by the Indictments of 6 June 2016 and 9 & 14 June 2017.54 The Indictments of 9 & 14 June 2017 were issued after the Claimant had notified the Respondent of its arbitration claim under the BIT on 6 March 2017.55 All of the above Indictments preceded the issue of the Request for Arbitration in these proceedings on 9 May 2018.\n\n(2) The Ankara 24th High Criminal Court held its 14th periodic hearing on 6 August 2019. This hearing had been scheduled in the 13th hearing on 23 May 2019.\n\n(3) At the hearing, the Prosecutor presented its conclusions on the merits and sought sentences of imprisonment for Mr Cafer Tekin Ipek, Ms Melek Ipek and Ms Ebru Ipek and the confiscation of their shares in companies transferred to the trusteeship of the SDIF;56\n\n(4) The Prosecutor also sought an enquiry into the status of the red notices for Mr Akin Ipek and Mr Yurttas and requested red notices for Ms Pelin Zenginer and Ms Nevin Ipek.57\n\n(5) The Court decided to:\n\n(a) Wait for the issue of apprehension decisions for Mr Akin Ipek and Mr Yurttas, Ms Pelin Zenginer and Ms Nevin Ipek;\n\n(b) Impose a ban on Ms Ebru Ipek from leaving Turkey; and,\n\n(c) Notified all defendants that their defences are to be presented at a hearing on 14-17 October 2019, with the warning that \"those who do not give their statements against the merits and the prosecutor's opinion on these dates...will be considered to have renounced such rights.\"58\n\nAnkara High Criminal Court Indictment No 2016/1632 (6 June 2016) **R-85;** Ankara High Criminal Court Indictment No 2017/3386 (9 June 2017) **R-21;** Ankara High Criminal Court Indictment No 2017/3425 (14 June 2017) **HAI-8.**\n\nLetter from Gibson Dunn (6 March 2017) **RfA Ex 20.** Article 8(2) of the BIT requires the investor to wait for one year after notification of a claim before it may institute arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention.\n\nHearing Minutes (6 August 2019) Annex 3 to Respondent's submission of 29 August 2019, 6-91.\n\nIbid, 97.\n\nIbid, 99-100.\n\n65.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal has a grave concern that the continued pursuit of the criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals during the pendency of the arbitration is likely to affect adversely the ability of the Claimant fairly to present its case. It notes the following factors:\n\n(1) While the criminal process has been extant for three years, it appears that it is now reaching a point where the defendants will imminently have to submit evidence in their defence or renounce their right to do so;\n\n(2) Mr Tekin Ipek has been imprisoned in Turkey since April 2016. The Tribunal is satisfied that he is likely to have relevant evidence to give in these proceedings.\n\n(3) Charges are also pending against a number of other persons who either wish to give evidence before this Tribunal or would have relevant evidence to give, including former senior executives of the Koza Group and its lawyers.\n\n(4) The Tribunal has serious concerns about the pendency of criminal proceedings against members of the Ipek family, including the mother, sister and wives of the key witnesses. It notes that the conclusions as to their criminality that the Prosecutor presented at the hearing on 6 August 2019 sought sentences of imprisonment and the Court has, since the Provisional Measures hearing, re-imposed a ban on Ms Ebru Ipek from leaving Turkey. The Tribunal cannot discount the effect upon the Claimant\u2019s Party Representative and other key witnesses of the continued pursuit of these charges during the arbitration.\n\n(5) The pursuit of a separate Indictment specifically against the lawyers who had advised the Koza Group raises further serious concerns as to the ability of the Claimant to avail itself of legal advice in Turkey.\n\n66.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is concerned that further pursuit of the criminal proceedings during the pendency of the arbitration will imperil the equality of the Parties by enabling the Respondent to obtain witness testimony and other evidence from the Claimant\u2019s witnesses through the use of its criminal process for use in the arbitration:\n\n(1) On 1 August 2019, immediately following the conclusion of the Provisional Measures hearing, the SDIF applied to the Ankara 24th Heavy Criminal Court by letter dated 30 July 2019 for a copy of every criminal case file before the Court relating to Mr Akin Ipek \"in order to serve as basis in the defences\" of the Respondent in the arbitration.59\n\n(2) The schedule now set by the Criminal Court for the other defendants before it will require them to submit their evidence (or renounce their right to do so) by 14 October 2019.\n\nEx A to Letter from Gibson Dunn dated 9 August 2019.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal makes no finding at this stage as to the admissibility before it of the material sought by the Respondent in its application to the Criminal Court of 1 August 2019. Rather, the Tribunal is concerned that the continued pursuit of the criminal process against the Targeted Individuals hereafter will prejudice the equality of the Parties by enabling the Respondent to obtain testimony and other evidence from the Claimant\u2019s witnesses under compulsion of internal law.\n\n68.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has established that there is an imminent risk of irreparable harm in the arbitration by reason of the continued pursuit of the criminal proceedings.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal has also given careful consideration to balancing the right of the Respondent to the pursuit of its criminal process. An Order from this Tribunal will not affect the pendency of the criminal proceedings that have already been brought; nor will it preclude the continued pursuit of those proceedings against persons other than the Targeted Individuals.\n\n70.\n\nThe criminal proceedings have already been extant for some three years. As has already been observed, if the Respondent is successful in its preliminary objections to jurisdiction, which will be heard in June 2020, any provisional measures recommended by this Tribunal will cease to have effect. In the event that the Tribunal were to decide to uphold its jurisdiction, it would revisit at that stage whether a provisional measure continues to be necessary and, if so, its scope. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that any effect upon the Respondent\u2019s criminal process is limited strictly to the extent necessary to enable the fair hearing of the present arbitration claim.\n\n*Legal and Physical Integrity*\n------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nFurther under this head, the Claimant seeks orders that:\n\n(1) \"Turkey shall refrain from engaging in any conduct that may directly or indirectly affect the legal or physical integrity of the Targeted Individuals for Criminal Proceedings\" and shall further\n\n(2) \"[P]rovide suitable and humane conditions for Mr Tekin Ipek in prison, including allowing him to work with Turkish and/or foreign attorneys in confidence and enabling him to provide witness testimony in this Arbitration.\"\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the first element of this order is warranted on the grounds that Mr Akin Ipek and his family have been subjected to a campaign of harassment and threats.60 The second element of this Order is necessary because Mr Tekin Ipek is held in inhumane conditions and lacks access to proper legal representation.61\n\nAkin Ipek WS 1, [83]-[88].\n\nIbid, [62].\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent points out that there is no evidence that the Respondent is behind any threats that Mr Akin Ipek has received, noting that Mr Akin Ipek accepts in his witness statement that \"[i]t is not necessarily clear to me who is behind these threats.\"62 It submits a letter from the Turkish Ministry of Justice, which provides details as to the access afforded to Mr Tekin Ipek to his lawyers.63\n\nIbid, [84].\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Justice to SDIF (14 June 2019) **R-150.**\n\n74.\n\n*Tribunal's analysis:* The Tribunal regards it as fundamental to the fair administration of justice that persons pursuing a claim, or appearing as witnesses, are entitled to do so without fear for the physical integrity of their person. So far as concerns legal integrity, the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention gave their solemn undertaking under Article 22 to accord immunity from legal process to parties, agents, counsel, witnesses and experts in ICSID arbitral proceedings with respect to acts performed by them in that capacity. The Tribunal regards it as a paramount duty upon the parties to respect these fundamental rights.\n\n75.\n\nNevertheless, on the evidence before it, it does not find grounds to suggest that any threats to the physical integrity of the Targeted Individuals are attributable to the Respondent. It does not therefore find it necessary to make an order in relation to the first sub-category.\n\n76.\n\nSo far as concerns Mr Tekin Ipek, the Tribunal wishes to ensure that Mr Ipek is enabled to prepare and give his evidence on matters relevant to this arbitration. This necessarily includes provision of access on a confidential basis to lawyers chosen by Mr Tekin Ipek to review his evidence relevant to this arbitration with him, including any drafts of his written testimony.\n\n77.\n\nAt the appropriate time prior to any hearing in which Mr Tekin Ipek\u2019s oral evidence is to be given, the Tribunal will wish to make suitable procedural directions to enable this evidence to be taken, for example by remote video link. It invites the Parties to consult each other with a view to reaching agreement on a protocol for this purpose.\n\n78.\n\nBeyond the indications just given, the Tribunal does not consider that a further order is warranted at this stage.\n\n*Restraint of related civil proceedings*\n----------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimant seeks an order restraining the continued pursuit of civil proceedings that it alleges directly relate to the arbitration. It refers specifically to:\n\n(1) *Koza-Ipek Holdings AS (under the Administration of TMSF) v Ipek et al* Docket No 2017/202 (\"the SPA Proceedings\");64 and,\n\n(2) *Capital Markets Board v Ipek* (\"the \u00a3 60 million claim\").65\n\nCase commenced 16 March 2017, Judgment of 2nd Commercial Court of First Instance delivered 11 July 2018, **R-24.**\n\nCase commenced 26 October 2016, Judgment of 10th Commercial Court of First Instance delivered 23 January 2019, **C-93.**\n\n80.\n\nThe SPA Proceedings were instituted after the Claimant had notified the Respondent of its claims in this Arbitration,66 but prior to its institution. In those proceedings, the Turkish Court has already entered judgment against the Defendants, who are presently pursuing an appeal.67 The Claimant accepts that, if this Tribunal were to make a provisional order to stay those proceedings, it would also apply to its appeal.68\n\nRfA Ex 20.\n\nAppeal Application 26 September 2018, **R-149.**\n\nT3/39/20-40/3.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant puts its case in respect of the \u00a3 60 million claim on the ground that, as this case seeks to recover \u00a3 60 million from Mr Akin Ipek and Mr Tekin Ipek personally, it is an attempt to prevent the Claimant from pursuing its claim, despite the fact that the English Court of Appeal has held that Koza Ltd is entitled to devote its funds to supporting the present arbitration.69\n\n*Koza Ltd v Ak\u00e7il* [2019] EWCA Civ 891, **CL-74,** permission to appeal to the Supreme Court pending.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the SPA Proceedings were commenced before the present arbitration and that it is the Claimant and the Ipek family that have chosen to pursue an appeal from judgment. It further submits that the \u00a3 60 million claim was also commenced prior to the arbitration and is not related to the matters at issue in the arbitration.70\n\nRejoinder, [91]-[94].\n\n83.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s analysis:* In contrast to the position in relation to criminal proceedings discussed in the previous section, the pendency of civil proceedings before national courts may engage the Parties\u2019 right to the exclusivity of ICSID arbitral proceedings, which is a right that is capable of protection by provisional measures.\n\n84.\n\nThe right itself is enshrined in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\n\n85.\n\nArticle 26 is a provision of central importance in the scheme of the Convention. In their Report on the ICSID Convention, the Executive Directors of the World Bank explain its purpose under the heading \u2018Arbitration as Exclusive Remedy\u2019:\n\nIt may be presumed that when a State and an investor agree to have recourse to arbitration, and do not preserve the right to have recourse to other remedies or require the prior exhaustion of other remedies, the intention of the parties is to have recourse to arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. This rule of interpretation is embodied in the first sentence of Article 26.\n\n86.\n\nThe leading commentary on the Convention states the matter in this way:71\n\nArt. 26 is the clearest expression of the self-contained and autonomous nature of the arbitration procedure provided for by the Convention. Unlike Art. 25, it only applies to arbitration but not to conciliation.\n\nThe first sentence of Art. 26 has two main features. The first is that, once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost their right to seek relief in another forum, national or international, and are restricted to pursuing their claim through ICSID. This principle operates from the moment of valid consent. This exclusive remedy rule of Art. 26 is subject to modification by the parties. The phrase \"unless otherwise stated\" in the first sentence gives the parties the option to deviate from it by agreement.\n\nThe second feature of Art. 26, first sentence, is that of non-interference with the ICSID arbitration process once it has been instituted. The principle of non-interference is a consequence of the self-contained nature of proceedings under the Convention. The Convention provides for an elaborate process designed to make arbitration independent of domestic courts.\n\nSchreuer el al, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn, CUP, 2009) ('Schreuer') 351.\n\n87.\n\nThe plain words of Art 26 require consideration of the *remedy* sought in the arbitration and the comparison of that remedy with any other remedies sought in other proceedings, since Art 26 operates to exclude those other remedies.\n\n88.\n\nWhat are the consequences of such exclusion? As one Tribunal put it, 'once the parties have consented to ICSID arbitration, they must refrain from initiating or pursuing proceedings in any other forum in respect of the subject matter of the dispute before ICSID\u2019 and 'the parties must withdraw or stay any and all judicial proceedings commenced before national jurisdictions... in connection with the dispute before the ICSID tribunal.'72\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* v *Ukraine* (Procedural Order No. 1 Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, (1 July 2003) **RL-107,** [1]-[2].\n\n89.\n\nThe question is whether on the facts the domestic proceedings might 'jeopardize the principle of exclusivity\u2019.73 This in turn requires consideration of whether there is a \u2018relevant relationship or nexus\u2019 between the two proceedings and the issues raised in them.74\n\nIbid, [3].\n\n*Government of New Zealand* v *Mobil Oil New Zealand Ltd* (1988) XIII Ybk Comm Arb 638, 643, 4 ICSID Rep 117, 118 ILR 620 (NZ HC), cited by Schreuer at 393, who opines that '[t]he outcome of this case is undoubtedly in full accord with the requirements of Art. 26.'\n\n90.\n\nIt is well accepted that ICSID tribunals may exercise their power to grant provisional measures in order to enforce the exclusive remedy of ICSID proceedings.75 So, for example, in *Millicom v Senegal,*76 the Tribunal issued a provisional measure under Art 47 inviting the parties to send joint letter seeking the suspension of proceedings in Senegal pending the Tribunal's own decision on jurisdiction. It accepted on principle the application for provisional measures.77 It held:78\n\nPursuing both sets of proceedings in parallel would necessarily involve complications, misunderstandings or even serious resistance at the stage of enforcing the decision, if the Arbitral Tribunal were to find in favour of the Claimants.\n\n*Plama Consortium Ltd. (Cyprus) v Bulgaria* (Order on Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, (6 September 2005) **CL-16,** [38]; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s*, [7]; Schreuer, Art 47, [99]-[134] (pp 784-793), and the numerous authorities there cited.\n\n*Millicom International Operations BV v Senegal* (Decision on Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures) ICSID Case No. ARB/08/20, (9 December 2009), **CL-70.**\n\n*Id.* at [49].\n\n*Id.* at [47(a)].\n\n91.\n\nIn the present case, both sets of Turkish civil proceedings had been commenced prior to the institution of the present arbitration and the Claimant agreed a timetable for the hearing of its Request that, in the event, has had the consequence that first instance judgments have already been entered in Turkey against the respective defendants. The Claimant and the other Defendants, members of the Ipek family, elected to pursue an appeal from that judgment despite the pendency of the present Arbitration and Request.\n\n92.\n\nThe judgment in the SPA proceedings plainly deals with an issue that will also be central to this arbitration, namely the validity of the SPA and in proceedings to which both TMSF and the Claimant are party. Nevertheless, as the Respondent rightly accepts, this Tribunal is not bound by the findings of the Ankara Commercial Court.79\n\nPreliminary Objections Memorial, [137].\n\n93.\n\nThis Tribunal is bound to apply international law to the determination of the Claimant\u2019s claims under the BIT. It is axiomatic that:80\n\nThe characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\n\nArt 3, International Law Commission. 'Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts' [2001] 2(2) YB ILC 26.\n\n94.\n\nFurthermore, the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention (which include Turkey and the United Kingdom) have accepted an international obligation to the effect that any Award in the present proceedings is \"binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\"81 In light of the general principle of state responsibility just cited, it is no answer to the due performance of such an obligation that there is an inconsistent judgment of a national court under internal law.\n\nArt 53 ICSID Convention.\n\n95.\n\nSo far as concerns the SPA Proceedings, the Tribunal considers that, while this Tribunal is seised of the present claim, the continued pendency of these proceedings would infringe the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration, a cardinal element of the scheme of the Convention to which all Contracting States have subscribed. As the leading commentary observes: \u2018This principle operates from the moment of valid consent.\u201982 The present Tribunal is of course yet to determine its jurisdiction, including whether valid consent has been given. This it is due to determine following the hearing on Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction in June 2020. A central element in that determination will be the validity of the SPA. In the interim, the Tribunal considers that neither Party should be placed in a position of having to litigate the same issue at the same time in a national court. It finds that a provisional measure staying the pending SPA Proceedings is necessary to preserve the position of both Parties pending the outcome of the Preliminary Objections phase.\n\nSchreuer, 351.\n\n96.\n\nSo far as concerns the \u00a3 60 million claim, this proceeding has also resulted in a first instance judgment in Ankara. The Tribunal does not consider that there is sufficient identity of parties or subject-matter of claim between those proceedings and this Arbitration to engage the right to exclusivity.\n\n97.\n\nIn reaching this decision, the Tribunal observes that in any event nothing in this Order relates to or affects the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in *Koza Ltd v Ipek*83 or the pending application for leave to appeal from that judgment.\n\n[2019] EWCA Civ 891, **CL-0074, CL-0075.**\n\n*Measures to protect the assets of the Koza Group*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe remaining assets of the Koza Group are under the administration of the SDIF as trustee.\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimant seeks an order to prevent their \"further appropriation or dissipation\" or \"any interference with or destruction of value\" of the Koza Group or the Claimant\u2019s legal rights under the BIT.\n\n100.\n\nIt submits that the Respondent intends to sell some of the assets of the Koza Group to the benefit of \"the Erdogan Regime\" and to the detriment of the Group.84 It alleges in particular that the SDIF is preparing to sell Koza Gold, the Group\u2019s most valuable remaining asset, to a Mr Ahmet Ahltaci, who is \"close to President Erdogan.\"85\n\nReply, [69].\n\nClaimant\u2019s closing slides, sl 43.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the assets of the Group are under the careful management of the SDIF as Trustee and are being managed strictly on a prudent commercial basis in the best interests of the Group. In support it adduced the evidence of Mr G\u00fcler, who is Vice President of the SDIF and member of the Board of Directors of Koza-Ipek Holding, and who was cross-examined at the hearing.86 Mr G\u00fcler confirmed his management responsibilities, and he also accepted in answer to questions from the Tribunal that it is within the power of the Trustee to dispose of the assets of a company under its administration.87\n\nG\u00fcler WS 1 & 2, T2/1-92.\n\nT2/87/14-88/17.\n\n102.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent further submits that, as a matter of law, this measure is not necessary to protect a legal right claimed by the Claimant in the arbitration. He submits that the Claimant seeks only a declaration and award of damages.88 It does not seek restitution of the assets that it alleges were expropriated. As such, a measure to prevent further dissipation is unnecessary, as, if the Claimant is ultimately successful in its claim, it will be compensated in damages.\n\nT3/92/22-93/14, citing RfA [126](b).\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimant accepts that damages is the relief that it seeks.89 It submits that the taking is at present temporary, and so the preservation of the assets of the Group is relevant to how much of the Group\u2019s assets may ultimately be returned and thus the calculation of damages.90\n\nT3/104/24.\n\nT3/103/12-104/7.\n\n104.\n\n*Tribunal's analysis.* In the event that the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim were ultimately to be upheld by this Tribunal, it would be entitled under the terms of the BIT to \"compensation... equivalent to the genuine value of the expropriated investment at the time the expropriatory action was taken...and shall include interest.\"91\n\nArt 5(1) BIT.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s legal submission that the Claimant does not seek restitution of the assets that it alleges were expropriated from it. Accordingly, it finds the grant of provisional measures to restrain the disposal of those assets is not necessary for the protection of the right claimed.\n\n*Measures to preserve documentary evidence*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nFinally, the Claimant seeks a provisional measure to preserve certain specified categories of documents that it claims will be necessary to enable it to present its case.\n\n107.\n\nIt submits that the Respondent seized almost all of the documents of the Koza Group in Turkey, either through the execution of search warrants in connection with the criminal investigation or by reason of the transfer of the administration of the Koza Group to the SDIF, It complains that Turkey has refused to give an undertaking as to their preservation.\n\n108.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent confirms that the SDIF has kept the documents of the Koza Group securely. It declines to give an undertaking, stating that it would be too broad and uncertain in scope.\n\n109.\n\n*Tribunal's analysis:* The power under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention to recommend provisional measures includes measures for the preservation of evidence.92 Indeed, as one Tribunal commented, \"This is one of the most common forms of interim relief.\"93\n\nSchreuer, Art 47, 780-2.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v Tanzania* (Procedural Order No 1) ICSID Case No ARB/05/22 (31 March 2006), **CL-0001,** [84].\n\n110.\n\nIn the present Tribunal\u2019s view, it is essential for a fair trial before an international investment tribunal that, especially once a claim has been brought, both parties take steps to ensure that evidence relevant to the matters in issue is preserved and not destroyed or otherwise disposed of. This obligation is a continuing one during the pendency of the arbitration.\n\n111.\n\nThis ensures that both Parties have an equal ability to exercise their right to seek the production of relevant documents. It is also a corollary of the express power of the Tribunal itself, enshrined in Article 43 of the Convention, to \"call upon the parties to produce documents or other evidence.\" As ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(3) confirms: \"The parties shall cooperate with the Tribunal in the production of the evidence.\"\n\n112.\n\nThis rule gives expression in this context to the parties\u2019 more general duty to each other and to the Tribunal to arbitrate in good faith. An obligation to take steps to preserve relevant documents within a party\u2019s possession, power or control once a claim has been brought is an essential corollary of this duty. Otherwise the Tribunal\u2019s need to have a full record and power to order production could be frustrated by a party\u2019s pre-emptive action.\n\n113.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal confirms that the responsibility of the Respondent in this regard extends to its executive and judicial organs. Such organs include its prosecutorial and investigative authorities and the SDIF, whether in its capacity as Trustee of the Koza Group companies or otherwise.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal expects both Parties to take due note of these observations. In the event that either Party were found subsequently to have disposed of relevant documentary evidence, the Tribunal is mandated under Rule 34(3) to take note of such Party\u2019s failure to comply with its obligations.\n\n115.\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to Article 9 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence 2010 (which the Parties agree, pursuant to PO No 1, [15.1], \u2018may guide the Tribunal and the Parties\u2019):\n\n(1) A failure without satisfactory explanation to produce any document ordered to be produced entitles the Tribunal to infer that such evidence would be adverse to the interests of that Party (Art 9(6)); and,\n\n(2) The failure of a Party to conduct itself in good faith in the taking of evidence entitles the Tribunal, in addition to any other measures, to take such failure into account in its assignment of costs (Art 9(7)).\n\n116.\n\nIt is a separate question whether a provisional measure is necessary to preserve the documents. Counsel for the Respondent accepted in argument that its real objection in this case was to the breadth of the order sought.94\n\nT1/100/10-13.\n\n117.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant accepted that the provisional measure that it seeks (as opposed to the general obligation of preservation for which it contends) is limited to the seven categories of documents specified in its Reply and enumerated above under head (5).95\n\nT3/57/4-22.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed these categories in light of the issues as presently pleaded between the Parties. It finds the categories to be generally relevant. In some respects it accepts the Respondent\u2019s submission that they are too broadly framed. This applies in particular to categories (f) and (g). Accordingly, the Tribunal will limit category (f) and will not issue a provisional measures order in respect of category (g), which is not germane in light of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis above as to the nature of the claim advanced before it.\n\n119.\n\nIt proposes therefore to issue a provisional measures order for the specific preservation of the following categories of documents:\n\n(a) Documents relating to the Comakli Report;\n\n(b) Documents relating to the claim that Koza-Ipek Holding had supported the alleged terrorist organisation, FETO;\n\n(c) Documents relating to the transfer of management of Koza Holding\u2019s business to the United Kingdom;\n\n(d) Documents relating to the SPA;\n\n(e) Documents relating to the seizure, closure, and/or sale of the Koza Media Companies and any of their assets;\n\n(f) Accounting and financial records for each of the companies in the Koza Group from 2015 to date.\n\n120.\n\nThe above order is without prejudice to:\n\n(1) The question whether any particular documents are subject to production at any stage in the proceedings, which the Tribunal will consider on their merits on application to it during each document production phase; and,\n\n(2) The general obligations of the Parties as regards document production as set out above.\n\n***Order***\n-----------\n\n121.\n\n**Now therefore, for the reasons set out above, and subject to the observations set out above as to the Parties\u2019 continuing obligations in these proceedings, the Tribunal issues the following recommendation in respect of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures:**\n\n**(1) Request (1) regarding extradition proceedings is denied; the Claimant has liberty' to re-apply on an urgent basis in the event of a material change of circumstances;**\n\n**(2) Request (2) regarding criminal proceedings is granted; the Respondent shall suspend the further pursuit of criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals for Criminal Proceedings pending the outcome of its Preliminary Objections in this arbitration;**\n\n**(3) Request (3) regarding civil proceedings is granted in respect of the SPA Proceedings; in the exercise of its power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(3) the Tribunal directs that both Parties shall seek a stay of those Proceedings pending the outcome of the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections in this arbitration; otherwise Request (3) is denied;**\n\n**(4) As to Request (4)(a) regarding the legal and physical integrity of the Targeted Individuals the Tribunal makes no order at this stage;**\n\n**(5) Requests (4)(b) & (c) regarding the assets of the Koza Group are denied;**\n\n**(6) Request (5) is granted in part.

This is because the Parties are agreed that, in any event, an award of security for costs of an arbitration under the ICSID Convention requires a finding of exceptional circumstances.\n\n4.\n\nUnless the Tribunal were satisfied that the present case constituted one that meets the test of exceptionality, it should not award security in any event.\n\n5.\n\nFor reasons that the Tribunal has already explained at length in PO No 5, in view of the agreement of both Parties as to the procedural posture of the case, in which a hearing on jurisdiction is by agreement to be held next June 2020, the Tribunal has already found that it would be inconsistent for it to find that there is no *prima facie* basis for jurisdiction.1\n\nPO No 5, [16]-[30], esp. [24].\n\n6.\n\nSo far as concerns the legal test, for the purpose of deciding the present Application, the Tribunal is content to assume in the Respondent\u2019s favour that it has the power to grant security for costs by way of a provisional measure under the general provisions of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39.\n\n7.\n\nIt would only become necessary to decide whether these provisions extend to a power to order security and, if so, whether the requirements that are applicable to other provisional measures (which this Tribunal considered and applied in PO No 5) are also applicable in the same way to security for costs in the event that the Tribunal were to find the existence of exceptional circumstances.2 Indeed this is envisaged by the order in which the Parties state the issues for the Tribunal in which the question of exceptional circumstances is raised for decision before the general legal test for provisional measures.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the ICSID Secretariat currently proposes to deal with security for costs by way of a separate provision (Rule 52): ICSID, *Proposals for Amendment of the ICSID Rules* (Working Paper No 3, August 2019), 333-5.\n\n*The test for exceptional circumstances*\n----------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe requirement that security for costs only be ordered in exceptional circumstances, which both Parties accept to be applicable in the present case, has been explained by previous tribunals in the following terms:\n\n(a) In *Libananco v Turkey,* the tribunal observed that:3\n\n[I]t would only be in the most extreme case\u2014one in which an essential interest of either Party stood in danger of irreparable damage\u2014that the possibility of granting security for costs should be entertained at all.\n\n(b) In *RSM v Grenada* the tribunal held that:4\n\nIt is difficult, in the abstract, to formulate a rule of general application against which to measure whether the making of an order for security for costs might be reasonable, but it seems clear to us that more should be required than a simple showing of the likely inability of a claimant to pay a possible costs award.\n\n(c) In *Lighthouse v Timor-Leste,* the tribunal stated:5\n\n[E]ven if it were assumed that the Claimants have insufficient assets, this would not be enough in and of itself. Something more is required.\n\n(d) In *South American Silver,* the tribunal added:6\n\nIn relation to the necessity and the urgency of the measure, investment arbitration tribunals considering requests for security for costs have emphasized that they may only exercise this power where there are extreme and exceptional circumstances that prove a high real economic risk for the respondent and/or that there is bad faith on the part[y] from whom the security for costs is requested.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co Ltd v Turkey* (Decision on Preliminary Issues) ICSID Case No ARB/06/8 (23 June 2008) **RL-21,** [57].\n\n*RSM Production Corp v Grenada* (Decision on Security for Costs) ICSID Case No ARB/05/14 (14 October 2010) **RL-27**, [5.20] (emphasis added).\n\n*Lighthouse Corp Pty Ltd v Timor-Leste* (Procedural Order No 2) ICSID Case No ARB/15/2 (13 February 2016) **RL-4,** [61].\n\n*South American Silver Ltd v Bolivia* (Procedural Order No 10) PCA Case No 2013-15 (11 January 2016), **CL-60,** [59].\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it convenient to examine the various grounds that the Respondent alleges give rise to exceptional circumstances under these two heads: (a) high economic risk and (b) bad faith/abuse of process.\n\n*High economic risk?*\n---------------------\n\n10.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Claimant does not itself have the funds to meet an adverse costs order. This in itself is insufficient to justify an order of security for costs, as prior tribunals have repeatedly observed.\n\n11.\n\nAn important general principle underlies this approach. The remedy provided to claimants under investment treaties is designed to protect investors against the loss of their property as a result of acts of expropriation or other state measures that may constitute international delicts under the terms of the treaty protections. These protections could be rendered nugatory if claimants who allege that their property has been taken by a state were routinely required, at the outset of international proceedings designed to obtain redress for such a wrong, to provide security for the costs of the respondent state. Such a requirement could give rise to a denial of justice if it had the result of precluding the vindication of claims that might otherwise be protected under the treaty.\n\n12.\n\nAccepting that it will not suffice for it to rely simply on the Claimant\u2019s impecuniosity, the Respondent submits that tribunals have pointed to a number of other factors that may be potentially relevant to the assessment of economic risk, including:\n\n(a) Whether the Claimant has defaulted on financial obligations in the present or other proceedings;\n\n(b) Whether the arbitration is funded by a third party and, if so, whether the terms of that funding cover adverse costs orders; and\n\n(c) Whether the Claimant has taken steps to avoid enforcement of an adverse costs order.7\n\nApplication, [56]\n\n13.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent points in particular to:\n\n(a) Alleged third-party funding arrangements with the Claimant\u2019s law firm8 and with Encore Mining Ltd; and,\n\n(b) The allegedly unsatisfactory state of the evidence as to Mr Akin Ipek\u2019s personal assets.\n\nOn 7 October 2019, the Tribunal was informed that, with effect from 4 October 2019, Latham & Watkins replaced Gibson, Dunn as the Claimant\u2019s counsel of record in these proceedings. As argument on the Application preceded this change of representation, all references herein to Claimant\u2019s counsel are to its former counsel Gibson Dunn.\n\n14.\n\nIn response, the Claimant states:\n\n(a) There is no third-party funding arrangement with either Gibson Dunn or Encore Mining Ltd. Gibson Dunn has merely agreed to defer payments until the Claimant has resolved its funding arrangements. Encore Mining Ltd has advanced two loans to enable the Claimant to fund its costs. In neither case do these arrangements give the third party any stake in the success or failure of the arbitration and the Claimant\u2019s obligation to pay is not contingent.9\n\n(b) Mr Ipek is not obliged to disclose the extent and location of his personal assets and, given the conduct of the Respondent of which it makes complaint in the proceedings, he should not be required to do so.\n\n(c) It has not defaulted on its payment obligations in the arbitration to date. On the contrary, it has taken active steps to put in place funding arrangements that would enable its costs obligations, including its potential liability for an adverse costs award, to be met, steps that the Respondent has sought to oppose.\n\nT3/202/23-203/23.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the evidence does not establish a third-party funder of these proceedings in the sense of a person who has taken a stake in the outcome of the proceedings and who might therefore be expected to bear responsibility for any costs exposure.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant has plainly sought to find external sources of funding for its costs. In addition to the Encore Mining loans the Claimant\u2019s principal focus has been an application to the English court by Koza Ltd and Mr Akin Ipek **(\"Koza Funding Application\")** which has as its object the funding of the arbitration out of the assets of that company.\n\n17.\n\nIn view of the pertinence of these proceedings to the instant question, it is necessary to set out the sequence of events in a little detail:\n\n(a) There is a dispute in the English High Court between Koza Ltd, an English company, and Mr Akin Ipek (one of its directors) as claimants and Koza Altin (the Turkish parent company) and its Turkish appointed trustees as defendants as to who is entitled to exercise corporate powers in respect of Koza Ltd.\n\n(b) In the course of that litigation, Koza Ltd and Mr Ipek made the Koza Funding Application. Its object is to vary an interim undertaking so as to permit inter alia the expenditure of up to GBP3 million in respect of costs in this arbitration up to the determination of jurisdiction, such costs to include a provision for GBP1.5 million to cover the risk of an adverse costs order.10\n\n(c) The Koza Funding Application was opposed by the defendants inter alia on the ground that such expenditure would be improper because the arbitration is founded on an SPA which \u2018is a sham,\u2019 the expenditure of sums in support of which \u2018cannot be a proper use of corporate funds.\u201911\n\n(d) At first instance, Richard Spearman QC (sitting as a deputy judge) denied the claimants\u2019 application. He found inter alia that, while funding the arbitration \u2018would be of benefit to Koza Ltd, and thus in the ordinary and proper course of business\u2019 the Court was entitled to take account of its doubts about the authenticity of the SPA and thus the attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal on the basis of it.12\n\n(e) The claimants appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal and discharged the negative declaration. Delivering the judgment of the Court on 23 May 2019, Floyd LJ observed:13\n\nI think, however, that attempting to resolve the issue of the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal in the meticulous and detailed manner attempted by the deputy judge, and repeated by the submissions made to us, is to approach the problem from the wrong end. The issue was whether providing funding for this arbitration was in the ordinary and proper course of business of Koza Ltd. The decision to pursue the funding of the arbitration is taken before, not after, the ICSID tribunal has ruled on its jurisdiction. It is therefore a matter to be considered from the perspective of the board of Koza Ltd. deciding on whether to embark on the funding. In my judgment, therefore, unless the prospects of success in the arbitration are so manifestly poor that they throw doubt on the board's motives in pursuing it, those prospects do not have any relevance to the issue.\n\n(f) The Court of Appeal concluded that Ipek Investment Limited had a case that the board of Koza Ltd \u2018could properly support in good faith,\u201914 but that nevertheless, because the authenticity of the SPA remains in doubt, Koza Ltd proceeds at its own risk in pursuing the funding of the arbitration.15\n\n(g) The Respondent sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal denied leave, but ordered that the claimant must not make the payments pending the resolution of the Respondents\u2019 application to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal.16\n\n*Koza Ltd v Ak\u00e7il* [2017] EWHC 2889 (Ch), **RL-3,** [56].\n\nIbid [72].\n\nIbid [126].\n\n*Koza Ltd v Ak\u00e7il* [2019] EWCA Civ 891, **CL-0074,** [39].\n\nIbid [41].\n\nIbid [48].\n\n**CL-0075,** [7]-[8].\n\n18.\n\nThe Defendants in the Koza Funding Application are represented by different legal counsel. Nevertheless, this Tribunal has already found that the SDIF, whether in its capacity as Trustee of the Koza Group of companies (which includes Koza Altin) or otherwise, is an organ of the Respondent state, whose conduct is attributable to the Respondent at international law.17 Mr G\u00fcler of the SDIF attended the hearing as Party Representative of the Respondent.18\n\nPO No 5, [113].\n\nIbid, n 3.\n\n19.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n(a) The Claimant has in fact been making reasonable efforts to make financial provision for the risk of an adverse costs order against it in the event that it is not successful at the jurisdictional stage; and\n\n(b) It is the Respondent that has opposed, and continues to oppose, the making of such provision through the acts of its organ.\n\n20.\n\nIn light of these findings, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not established conduct on the part of the Claimant in relation to the economic risk of non-payment that might support an award of security for costs.\n\n*Bad faith/abuse of process?*\n-----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIt remains to consider whether the Claimant\u2019s conduct more generally might justify a finding of bad faith or abuse of process.\n\n22.\n\nFor this purpose it is important to maintain a clear distinction between the merits of the claim\u2014including the merits of the Claimant\u2019s alleged basis for invoking the jurisdiction of the tribunal\u2014and the Claimant\u2019s conduct in the pursuit of the proceedings. The Respondent accepts that \"[t]he Republic and the Claimant agree that the Tribunal must decide the Application without prejudging the likelihood of success or failure of each Party on the merits.\"19\n\nReply, [3].\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found in PO No 520 that:\n\n25. The Claimant has advanced a serious claim in its Request for Arbitration dated 9 May 2018, and has invoked an arguable basis for jurisdiction under the BIT. The Respondent has for its part advanced a substantial objection to the jurisdiction in its Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 12 April 2019, to which the Claimant has, since the hearing on provisional measures now filed its Defence on 5 September 2019.\n\n26. At the heart of both the Claimant's claim to jurisdiction and the Respondent's objection is the validity of the Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), which the Claimant alleges it entered into on 7 June 2015. This forms the basis for the Claimant's claim to be a \"company\" incorporated in the United Kingdom that has made an \"investment\" in Turkey within the meaning of the BIT; and \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\n27. For its part, the Respondent alleges that the SPA is a sham, which provides no basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and that the Claimant\u2019s claim is an abuse of process, violating the universal requirement of good faith.\n\n28. The validity *vel non* of that ground for jurisdiction will, by agreement of both Parties, fall to be determined next year on the hearing of all of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction.\n\n29. It would be inconsistent with this procedural posture and would prejudge the issues that both Parties have submitted for decision in the jurisdiction phase, for the Tribunal to make any further finding on jurisdiction or the merits at this stage.\n\nPO No 5, [25]-[29] internal citations omitted.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the same reasoning is equally applicable here: It would be inconsistent with the procedure agreed between the Parties for it to prejudge an issue-whether the SPA is a valid document or a sham\u2014that they have placed squarely before the Tribunal for determination in the jurisdictional phase.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal specifically rejects the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Claimant\u2019s agreement to bifurcate is indicative of bad faith. The Respondent could, had it so wished, have insisted that the Claimant file its Memorial on the Merits prior to advancing any jurisdictional objections.21 The Respondent fairly accepted at the hearing that this was so and submitted that the agreement to bifurcate and proceed directly to the jurisdiction phase \"was an effort on our part to mitigate costs and shorten the proceedings.\"22 In any event, the effect of bifurcation will be to focus attention in the preliminary phase specifically on the conduct of the Claimant that the Respondent alleges constitutes bad faith and an abuse of process, namely its allegation that the SPA is a sham.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1).\n\nT3/134/18-22.\n\n26.\n\nAside from this central issue, on which the Tribunal cannot and would not prejudge the issues prior to the hearing on jurisdiction next year, it does not consider that the Respondent has established that the Claimant has acted in a manner that is abusive or in bad faith in its prosecution of the proceedings to date.\n\n27.\n\nThe case may be contrasted with the position in *RSM v Grenada,* where the tribunal ordered security for costs on the respondent\u2019s second renewed application.23 In that case, the claimant had a prior proven record of non-payment of costs, including the advances on costs requested by the ICSID Secretariat. The tribunal in that case stressed that \"Claimant\u2019s consistent procedural history in other ICSID and non-ICSID proceedings provide compelling ground for granting Respondent\u2019s request.\"24 No comparable procedural conduct is found in the present case.\n\n*RSM Production Corp v Grenada* (Decision on Security for Costs) ICSID Case No ARB/12/10 (13 August 2014) **RL-6.**\n\nIbid, [82].\n\n*Order*\n-------\n\n28.\n\n**Now therefore, for the above reasons, the Tribunal denies the Respondent\u2019s Application for security for the costs of the preliminary jurisdictional phase of these proceedings and reserves the costs of the Application.**"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 16 (on the SPA Proceedings)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2020-04-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 16 (on the SPA Proceedings)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n***Whereas:***\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 19 September 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (**PO No 5**), in which it *inter alia* directed that \"both Parties seek a stay of the SPA Proceedings [*Koza-Ipek Holdings AS (under the Administration of TMSF) v Ipek et al* Docket No 2017/202 (the **SPA Proceedings**)] pending the outcome of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections in the present arbitration.\"1\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, [121](3).\n\n2.\n\nOn 17 January 2020, the Claimant filed a letter with the Tribunal (the **Application**), in which it argued that the Respondent does not intend to comply with the Tribunal's order in PO No 5, as it had rejected all of the options for the stay of the SPA Proceedings proposed by the Claimant, considering its submission of the SDIF's letter to the civil court to be sufficient for the Respondent's compliance with PO No 5. The Claimant submitted that in order to preserve the *status quo* of the present arbitration, it required an appropriate relief from the Tribunal, and requested the Tribunal to direct the Respondent through the SDIF to\n\n\"[P]rocure that Koza Ipek Holding AS (plaintiff in the SPA Proceedings and now controlled by the Respondent through the SDIF as trustee and directors appointed by the SDIF and/or the Erdo\u011fan regime itself) does not seek to enforce or execute any judgement or other decision handed down in the SPA Proceedings pending the outcome of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections in this arbitration.\"2\n\nApplication, [p. 2].\n\n3.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's directions, on 27 January 2020, the Respondent sent its comments on the Application (the **Response**), in which it stated that it had complied with the Tribunal's order in PO No 5 by submitting a copy of PO No 5 to the civil court and that the decision on whether the SPA Proceedings will be stayed is up to the judiciary's own independent determination, as the Respondent cannot compel the civil court to stay the proceedings. The Respondent further argued that the proposed options for the stay of the SPA Proceedings referred to by the Claimant were either beyond the scope of the relief in PO No 5, or had no effect under Turkish law. It finally noted that the relief sought in the SPA Proceedings is declaratory and therefore it was \"*difficult to see how Koza-Ipek Holding would seek to 'enforce or execute' such a declaratory judgment*.\"3\n\nResponse, [4].\n\n4.\n\nOn 24 February 2020, the Tribunal invited a second round of comments from the Parties on this matter.\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 March 2020, the Claimant filed its comments on the Response (the **Reply**), and maintained its request that the Tribunal \"*direct the Respondent to, through the SDIF, procure that Koza \u0130pek Holding A\u015e does not seek to enforce or execute any judgment or other decision handed down in the SPA Proceedings pending the outcome of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections*.\"4\n\nReply, [p. 2].\n\n6.\n\nOn 9 March 2020, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Reply (the **Rejoinder**), requesting that the Tribunal dismiss the Application noting *inter alia* that since the judgment in the SPA Proceeding is of declaratory nature \"there is no place to enforce or execute it [\u2026] and hence no prejudice from which the Claimant requires the Tribunal's protection.\"5\n\nRejoinder, [9].\n\n**The Tribunal, having deliberated, now decides as follows:**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***The Tribunal's analysis***\n-----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present Application can be dealt with shortly, because the Tribunal has already set forth the essential elements of its approach in its previous procedural orders.\n\n2.\n\nIn PO No 5, it explained in paragraphs [83]\u2013[95] that:\n\n(a) Pursuant to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention (to which both Turkey and the United Kingdom are parties), consent to ICSID arbitration operates *'to the exclusion of any other remedy;'*\n\n(b) This gives rise to a right that is capable of protection by provisional measures;\n\n(c) This right is engaged in the present case by the continued pursuit of the SPA Proceedings because those proceedings concern an issue that is also central to the present arbitration, namely the validity of the SPA;\n\n(d) The Tribunal is not bound by any judgment of a national court in the determination of the Claimant's claims under international law; and,\n\n(e) Neither Party should be placed in the position of having to litigate the same issue in a national court at the same time as it is subject to the Tribunal's determination on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections.\n\n3.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal ordered that *'both Parties shall seek a stay'* of the SPA Proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal further found at [113] that the *'the responsibility of the Respondent\u2026extends to its executive and judicial organs. Such organs include\u2026the SDIF, whether in its capacity as Trustee of the Koza Group companies or otherwise.'*\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant maintains in the Application that the Respondent has failed to agree to any of the three options that it proposed in its letter of 20 December 2019, namely withdrawal, recall or suspension. This being so, it seeks an order that the Respondent procure that the plaintiff in the SPA Proceedings *'does not seek to enforce or execute any judgement or other decision handed down in the SPA Proceedings pending the outcome of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections in this arbitration.'*\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that PO No 5 requires neither withdrawal nor recall of the Turkish proceedings. The purpose of provisional measures is, as Article 47 of the Convention states, *'to preserve the respective rights of either party.'* They are not intended to alter the position. Either withdrawal or recall of the Turkish proceedings would go further than the Tribunal ordered in PO No 5 and would exceed the proper purpose of provisional measures.\n\n7.\n\nSo far as concerns suspension, the Respondent maintains that the parties have no power, as a matter of Turkish civil procedure to agree to a stay of proceedings, and that any such relief is a matter for the Turkish judiciary, in whose decisions the executive may not intervene. It contends that its letter to the Turkish court of 27 December 2019 constitutes sufficient compliance with the Tribunal's Order.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal explained in PO No 15 at paragraphs [20]\u2013[23] that, as a matter of international law, the obligations that the Respondent voluntarily assumed when it entered into both the ICSID Convention and the BIT apply to all of the organs of the State *'whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or other functions.'* It rejects as irrelevant under international law the distinction that the Respondent makes under its internal law between the executive and the judiciary.\n\n9.\n\nFor the same reason, it rejects as unfounded the more limited relief that the Claimant now seeks. The Tribunal's order that both Parties seek a stay of the SPA Proceedings, made in PO No 5 at [121](3), continues to apply. The stay that the Tribunal has mandated applies to all steps in the SPA Proceedings, including the pursuit of the appeal and any steps for enforcement.\n\n10.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not supported by evidence the further relief that it seeks. It has adduced no evidence as to the current status of the SPA Proceedings, which might suggest that enforcement and execution is imminent.\n\n11.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal finds that the letter from the President of the SDIF to the Ankara Regional Court of 27 December 2019 is not in compliance with the Tribunal's order. The letter does not seek a stay of the SPA Proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nRather, it submits a copy of PO No 5 to the Ankara Regional Court for its information and recites Article 138 of the Turkish Constitution to the effect that *'No organ, authority, office or individual may give orders or instructions to courts or judges relation to the exercise of judicial power, send them circulars, or make recommendations or suggestions.'*\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal well understands the purpose of such a provision within the internal legal order of a constitutional state, namely to preserve the independence of the judiciary from executive interference. Such a provision is not germane to the question of due compliance with the provision of PO No 5 relating to the SPA Proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nThe SPA Proceedings were, as their short title confirms, brought by *'Koza-Ipek Holdings AS (under the Administration of TMSF)'* [SDIF]. The SDIF, while an organ of the state, is thus responsible for the initiation and pursuit of the SPA Proceedings as a civil litigant. As a plaintiff in civil proceedings, it is plainly entitled, like any civil litigant, to seek relief from the civil court. It has exercised that power by seeking the relief that it did in the SPA Proceedings, obtaining a judgment in its favour; and responding to the defendants' appeal. This is no incursion upon the principle of judicial independence from the executive. It merely reflects the ordinary powers of civil litigants to advance pleas and make submissions, on which the court must then rule.\n\n15.\n\nIn these circumstances, this Tribunal need not rule on whether there is, as Respondent asserts, any power in the Turkish Civil Code for parties to civil litigation to seek a stay of proceedings. In the Tribunal's view, the Parties have not properly joined issue on this question of national law. The Respondent cites no authority for its proposition. The Tribunal doubts whether the provision that the Claimant cites is applicable. It is not necessary to decide this finally at the present stage.\n\n16.\n\nAll that the Tribunal has ordered is that the Parties both seek such an order. It will be for the Turkish Court to determine the relief to be granted, bearing in mind the international obligations of the State of which the Court forms a part.\n\n***The Tribunal's decision***\n-----------------------------\n\n17.\n\n**In light of the above considerations, the Tribunal decides that:**\n\n(1) **The Respondent, by the SDIF as Administrator of the Plaintiff in the SPA Proceedings, shall in compliance with PO No 5 paragraph [121](3) seek a stay of the SPA Proceedings from the Ankara Regional Court pending the outcome of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections.**\n\n(2) **Save as provided above, the Claimant's Application for additional relief is denied.**\n\n(3) **Either Party is at liberty to provide a copy of this Order to the Ankara Regional Court for the purpose of seeking compliance with it;**\n\n(4) **Costs reserved.**\n\n22 April 2020"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2022-12-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**T****able of** **A****bbreviations****/D****efined** **T****erms**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| After Closing Actions | The obligations respectively imposed on the Claimant (as purchaser of Koza-Ipek Holding shares) and Koza-Ipek Holding pursuant to clauses 5.1 and 5.2 of the SPA |\n| Akin Ipek (sometimes referred to as Hamdi Ipek or Mr Ipek) | Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, director of and 20% shareholder in the Claimant |\n| August 2014 Masak Report | AK Report No 2014/AR (71)\u20101, exhibit [R-48] |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 22 October 1996 |\n| C-[#] | Claimant's Exhibit |\n| CL-[#] | Claimant's Legal Authority |\n| Claimant or Ipek | Ipek Investment Limited |\n| Defence | Claimant's Statement of Defence to Respondent's Preliminary Objections, dated 5 September 2019 |\n| FETO | Fetullah\u00e7\u0131 Ter\u00f6r \u00d6rg\u00fct\u00fc |\n| G\u00fclen movement or Hizmet | An organisation of followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen, an Islamic preacher residing in the United States of America |\n| Hearing | Hearing on Jurisdiction held 19 to 23 July, 26 and 27 July and 27 and 28 September 2021 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| Ipek Family | Hamdi Akin Ipek, Cafer Tekin Ipek, Melek Ipek, Pelin Zenginer, Nevin Ipek and Ebru Ipek |\n| Koza Altin | Koza Alt\u0131n \u0130\u015fletmeleri A.\u015e., a Turkish gold mining company within the Koza Group |\n| Koza Media Companies | The companies within the Koza Group that operate media properties, including newspapers, television channels and radio stations |\n| Koza Group | A Turkish conglomerate consisting of eighteen companies spanning eleven industry sectors, including mining, energy, media, real estate, and agriculture |\n| Koza-Ipek Holding | Koza-\u0130pek Holding A.\u015e., the Koza Group's Turkish parent holding company |\n| MASAK | The Turkish Financial Crimes Investigation Board |\n| Mehmet Ali | Mehmet Ali Erdogan, Regnum Solicitors, London |\n| Memorial | Respondent's Memorial on Preliminary Objections, dated 12 April 2019 |\n| Parties | The Claimant and the Respondent |\n| Proposal Document | Draft presentation document dated 20 May 2015, summarising the Proposed 10% SPA transaction which had been prepared by Morgan Lewis, attached to exhibit [R-50]. |\n| Proposed 10% SPA | The transaction structure proposed by Morgan Lewis wherein the Ipek Family would transfer 10% of their shareholding in Koza-Ipek Holding to the Claimant, including the draft SPAs at exhibits [C-222]\u2013[C-224]. |\n| R-[#] | Respondent's Exhibit |\n| R Cl sl | Respondent's Closing slides |\n| RL-[#] | Respondent's Legal Authority |\n| Respondent or the Republic | Republic of T\u00fcrkiye |\n| Rejoinder | Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, dated 25 August 2020 |\n| RfA-[#] | Request for Arbitration's Exhibit |\n| Reply | Respondent's Reply Memorial in Support of its Preliminary Objections, dated 3 April 2020 |\n| Request | The Claimant's Request for Arbitration, dated 9 May 2018 |\n| SDIF or TMSF | Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of T\u00fcrkiye |\n| SHA | Draft Shareholders' Agreement dated 1 June 2015, attached to exhibit [R-53] |\n| SPA | The Share Purchase Agreement, dated on its face 7 June 2015, for the purchase of the Ipek Family's shares in Koza-Ipek Holding by the Claimant, exhibit [RfA-4] |\n| SPA Proceedings | *Koza\u2013Ipek Holdings AS (under the Administration of TMSF) v Ipek et al* Docket No 2017/202.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ('**ICSID**' or the '**Centre**') on the basis of the Article 8 of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 22 October 1996 (the '**BIT**' or '**Treaty**') and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the '**ICSID Convention**').\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is Ipek Investment Limited ('**Ipek**' or the '**Claimant**'), a limited company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom on 26 May 2015.\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye (the '**Republic**' or the '**Respondent**').\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the '**Parties**.' The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute arises out of actions taken with respect to the Koza Group, a group of companies operating in a variety of fields in T\u00fcrkiye, including mining, energy and the media (the '**Koza Group**'), the Turkish parent company of which \u2013 Koza-\u0130pek Holding A.\u015e. ('**Koza-Ipek Holding**') \u2013 the Claimant avers to be the sole shareholder.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant alleges a number of violations of the BIT on the part of the Respondent, including expropriatory conduct targeting the Koza Group through, *inter alia*, the appointment of trustees to Koza Group companies, the transfer of control of these companies to a state organ, and the closure of media companies in the Koza Group and the transfer of their assets to the Government. The Claimant additionally alleges a failure to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant through, *inter alia*, adverse regulatory decisions and criminal proceedings that the Claimant avers to be specious. The Claimant further alleges a failure to accord national treatment or most-favoured nation treatment to the Claimant, and a failure to permit free transfers of dividends by denying recognition of the Claimant as sole shareholder of Koza-Ipek Holding.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent raises three objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and alleges the Claimant's claim is an abuse of process. Pursuant to Procedural Order No 1 dated 19 November 2018, and by agreement between the Parties, the Respondent's Preliminary Objections have been addressed in a preliminary phase of the proceedings and are the subject of this Award.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 9 May 2018, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 9 May 2018 from Ipek against the Republic (the '**Request**').\n\n9.\n\nOn 29 May 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n10.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Campbell McLachlan, a national of New Zealand, President, appointed by agreement of the co-arbitrators; L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada, appointed by the Claimant; and Laurent L\u00e9vy, a national of Switzerland and Brazil, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 September 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the '**Arbitration Rules**'), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms Jara M\u00ednguez Almeida, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 10 November 2018 at the World Bank facilities in Paris, France.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 19 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No 1 also sets out a schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding.\n\n15.\n\nOn 15 November 2018, the Claimant filed its Request for Provisional Measures, along with exhibits C-1 \u2013 C-70 and legal authorities CL-1 \u2013 CL-21.\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 November 2018, the Respondent by email requested that the Tribunal not review the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures as filed and order the Claimant to withdraw the Request.\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 November 2018 the Claimant addressed the Tribunal in opposition to the Respondent's application. The Tribunal solicited a second round of comments from the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent filed its reply on 30 November 2018. As amended, the Respondent's request was that the Tribunal order exhibits C-42 and C-43 be excluded from the arbitration file.\n\n19.\n\nExhibit C-43 is the anonymous statement of Witness A ('**Witness A Statement**') while exhibit C-42 is entitled the 'Expert Report of Professor Sir Jeffrey Jowell KCMG KC in the Matter of an Extradition Request from [T\u00fcrkiye]'. Both documents were originally filed in proceedings before the Westminster Magistrates' Court concerning the Republic's request for the extradition of Mr Akin Ipek, a shareholder and director of the Claimant.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its rejoinder on 6 December 2018, providing as Annex A a version of its request for provisional measures in which all references to exhibits C-42 and C-43 had been redacted.\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 December 2018, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 2. The Tribunal ordered that the redacted form of the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, as submitted on 6 December 2018, be admitted into the record and treated as having been duly filed on the original date of filing (15 November 2018). The Tribunal additionally invited the Claimant to indicate by 7 January 2019 whether it wished to file exhibits C-42 and C-43 as an expert report and witness statement, respectively; and stated the Claimant should apply by 14 January 2019 if it wished the evidence of Witness A to be given anonymously.\n\n22.\n\nAlso on 21 December 2018, the Respondent filed its Application for Security for Costs, together with exhibits R-1 \u2013 R-29 and legal authorities RL-12 \u2013 RL-33.\n\n23.\n\nOn 7 January 2019, the Claimant notified its request that the Witness A Statement be treated as a witness statement.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 January 2019, the Claimant submitted an application for Witness A's evidence in support of the Request for Provisional Measures to be given anonymously, together with legal authorities CL-29 \u2013 CL-30.\n\n25.\n\nOn 28 January 2019, the Respondent filed its response to the application for Witness A's evidence to be given anonymously, along with an expert report by Jeffrey Waincymer containing exhibits JW-1 \u2013 JW-37. The Claimant filed its reply on 4 February 2019, and the Respondent submitted its rejoinder on 7 February 2019.\n\n26.\n\nOn 1 March 2019, the Respondent filed its Response to the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, together with the Witness Statement of Mr \u0130smail G\u00fcler, exhibit R-30 and legal authorities RL-34 \u2013 RL-65.\n\n27.\n\nOn 8 March 2019, the Claimant filed its Response to the Respondent's Application for Security for Costs, together with exhibits C-71 \u2013 C-77 and legal authorities CL-32 \u2013 CL-62.\n\n28.\n\nOn 13 March 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 3. The Tribunal found that it was entitled to review the Witness A Statement for the purpose of deciding its admissibility as evidence.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal further ordered the 28 November 2018 judgment of the Westminster Magistrates' Court, in which the Republic's request for the extradition of Mr Akin Ipek was denied,1 be admitted into the arbitration record.\n\n*Government of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye v Buyuk, Celik & Ipek*, Westminster Magistrates' Court, Judgment, 28 November 2018, [CL-29].\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision on the Claimant's application for Witness A's evidence to be given anonymously was adjourned, with the Parties to apprise the Tribunal of any further material developments regarding an appeal from the judgment of the Westminster Magistrates' Court affecting the likelihood of Mr Akin Ipek's deportation. In the event of such a development, the Claimant would have leave to renew its application by notice to the Respondent and the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nOn 12 April 2019, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections (the '**Memorial**'), together with the expert report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli; exhibits R-31 \u2013 R-129; and legal authorities RL-66 \u2013 RL-98.\n\n32.\n\nOn 9 May 2019, the Tribunal issued a revised procedural timetable; the Parties having communicated their agreement to extend the deadline for subsequent submissions on provisional measures.\n\n33.\n\nOn 16 May 2019, the Claimant filed its Reply in Support of its Request for Provisional Measures, together with exhibits C-78 \u2013 C-101, the Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek (itself together with exhibits HAI-1 \u2013 HAI-15), the Witness Statement of Mr Ayhan Yurttas (itself together with exhibits AY-1 \u2013 AY-23), and legal authorities CL-63 \u2013 CL-72.\n\n34.\n\nAlso on 16 May 2019, the Respondent filed its Reply on the Application for Security for Costs together with exhibits R-130 \u2013 R-134 and legal authorities RL-99 \u2013 RL-112.\n\n35.\n\nOn 17 June 2019, the Claimant filed an Application for Witness Anonymity together with exhibits C-110 \u2013 C-114, requesting that four witnesses \u2013 Witness 1, 2, 3 and Witness A \u2013 be allowed to submit anonymous evidence, with proposed conditions, in support of the Claimant's Statement of Defence on Preliminary Objections.\n\n36.\n\nOn 28 June 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Provisional Measures, together with the Second Witness Statement of Mr \u0130smail G\u00fcler, exhibits R-135 \u2013 R-182 and legal authorities RL-113 \u2013 RL-116.\n\n37.\n\nAlso on 28 June 2019, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on the Respondent's Application for Security for Costs, together with exhibits C-115 \u2013 C-116 and legal authorities CL-73 \u2013 CL-78.\n\n38.\n\nOn 15 July 2019, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimant's Application for Witness Anonymity.\n\n39.\n\nHaving heard oral arguments from both Parties between 24 and 26 July 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 4 on 12 August 2019. The Claimant's application to adduce expert evidence on Turkish law from Witnesses 2, 3, and A on an anonymised basis was declined. With respect to the Claimant's application to adduce fact evidence from Witness 1 in an anonymised manner, the Tribunal determined:\n\n'(a) The Claimant may serve and file with its Statement of Defence a written statement of the evidence of Witness 1 in anonymised form;\n\n(b) Any such statement will be available for review by counsel and party representatives for the Respondent and by the Tribunal and may be referred to for any subsequent application for witness anonymity that may be made.\n\n(c) Such a statement will not form part of the record in this arbitration unless and until either:\n\n(i) Witness 1 appears to give evidence in the ordinary way; or,\n\n(ii) The Claimant makes a subsequent application for leave to adduce his/her evidence on an anonymised basis and that application is granted by the Tribunal,\n\n(iii) Any such application is to be made at the latest 60 days before service of the Claimant's Rejoinder;'\n\n40.\n\nOn 28 August 2019 the Claimant sought permission from the Tribunal to extend the deadline for filing its Statement of Defence on Preliminary Objections by one week. The Respondent, by email on 28 August 2019 and by letter on 29 August 2019, requested the Tribunal reject the Claimant's application for an additional deadline, and suggested extensions to subsequent deadlines if the extension were to be granted. On 30 August 2019, the President of the Tribunal revised the procedural timetable, extending the filing deadline for the Statement of Defence on Preliminary Objections by three days.\n\n41.\n\nOn 5 September 2019, the Claimant filed its Statement of Defence to Respondent's Preliminary Objections (the '**Defence**'), together with the Witness Statement of Witness 1 (together with exhibit W1-1), the Second Witness Statement of Hamdi Akin Ipek (together with exhibits HAI-16 \u2013 HAI-75), the Second Witness Statement of Ayhan Yurttas (together with exhibits AY-24 \u2013 AY-26), the expert report of Professor Savas Bozbel, exhibits C-119 \u2013 C-138, and legal authorities CL-80 \u2013 CL-119.\n\n42.\n\nOn 19 September 2019, in accordance with the Revised Procedural Timetable, the Parties exchanged Requests for Production of Documents relevant to Jurisdiction.\n\n43.\n\nFollowing a hearing before the Tribunal on 24 \u2013 26 of July 2019, and an additional round of correspondence between the Parties and the Tribunal, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 5 on Provisional Measures on 19 September 2019.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that the provisional measures sought by the Claimant fell into four broad categories: (i) protection from criminal proceedings in T\u00fcrkiye against a number of persons associated with the Claimant due to their alleged effect on the arbitration; (ii) measures restraining the pursuit of related civil proceedings in T\u00fcrkiye; (iii) measures preserving assets of the Koza Group from disposal or dissipation pending the Tribunal's award; and (iv) measures preserving documents relevant to issues in dispute in the arbitration.\n\na. With respect to the first category, the Claimant's request for the Respondent to suspend and/or refrain from initiating extradition proceedings was denied, with the Claimant at liberty to re-apply on an urgent basis in the event of a material change of circumstances. The Claimant's request regarding criminal proceedings was granted; the Respondent was directed to suspend the further pursuit of criminal proceedings against the individuals named in the request pending the outcome of its Preliminary Objections. On the Claimant's request 4(a), concerning the legal and physical integrity of the same individuals subject to the criminal proceedings request, the Tribunal made no order at that stage.\n\nb. As to the second category: the Claimant's request for the suspension of civil proceedings was granted in respect of the proceedings where the validity of the share purchase agreement of Koza-Ipek Holdings' shares to the Claimant is at issue, namely *Koza\u2013Ipek Holdings AS (under the Administration of TMSF) v Ipek et al* Docket No 2017/202 (the '**SPA Proceedings**'), but otherwise denied.\n\nc. As to the third category, the Claimant's requests concerning preservation of the Koza Group assets were denied.\n\nd. As to the fourth category, the Claimant's request for preservation of documents was granted in part. The Tribunal noted that the Parties have a general duty to preserve relevant evidence, and specifically ordered the Respondent to take steps to preserve the documents listed in its order.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal additionally noted the Claimant's intention to enable Mr Tekin Ipek, the brother of Mr Akin Ipek who has been imprisoned in T\u00fcrkiye since April 2016, to give witness evidence. The Tribunal was 'satisfied that he is likely to have relevant evidence to give in these proceedings',2 and invited the Parties to consult each other with a view to reaching agreement on a protocol for the giving of evidence by Mr Tekin Ipek.\n\nPO No 5, [65(2)].\n\n46.\n\nOn 13 October 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 6. In light of its previous order that the Respondent 'shall suspend the further pursuit of criminal proceedings against the Targeted Individuals for Criminal Proceedings pending the outcome of its Preliminary Objections in this arbitration',3 and noting the imminent resumption of a criminal trial against a Targeted Individual, the Tribunal directed that the Respondent submit, by 14 October 2019, copies of its Procedural Order Nos 5 and 6 to the Public Prosecutor and the Ankara Criminal Court hearing the relevant proceedings, so that the Court may take into account the Tribunal's Orders.\n\nPO No 5, [121(2)].\n\n47.\n\nOn 14 October 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 7, in which the Respondent's application for security for costs was denied.\n\n48.\n\nOn 17 October 2019, the Parties filed Redfern schedules with the Tribunal, specifying Requests for Production of Documents relevant to Jurisdiction in respect of which relief was sought from the Tribunal.\n\n49.\n\nOn 15 November 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 8, together with two annexes. The Tribunal ordered each Party to produce to the other the documents specified by the Tribunal by 12 December 2019, with leave reserved for each Party to apply in respect of this Order by 22 November 2019. Schedule A annexed to the Order marked the Claimant's Request, while Schedule B annexed to the Order marked the Respondent's Request.\n\n50.\n\nOn 24 December 2019, following an application dated 22 November 2019 by the Respondent in respect of Procedural Order No 8 and the exchange of written submissions by the Parties, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 9. The Tribunal treated the Respondent's application dated 22 November 2019 in substance to be a new application, and ordered the Claimant to make certain original documents available for forensic examination by Party-appointed experts, on conditions set by the Tribunal in its Order.\n\n51.\n\nOn 3 January 2020, the Respondent applied for the forensic inspection of computers and other electronic devices on which the final version of the documents sought in the application of 22 November 2019 were prepared.\n\n52.\n\nOn 10 January 2020 the Claimant informed the Tribunal that three individuals, in respect of whom the Tribunal had directed the Respondent suspend its criminal proceedings4 \u2013 Mr Tekin Ipek, Ms Melek Ipek and Ms Ebru Ipek \u2013 had been convicted and sentenced before the Ankara 24th Assize Court.\n\nPO No 5, [121(2)].\n\n53.\n\nOn 17 January 2020 the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, arguing the Respondent did not intend to comply with the Tribunal's direction in Procedural Order No 5 that both Parties seek a stay of the SPA Proceedings. The Claimant requested the Tribunal to direct the Respondent to procure that the plaintiff in the SPA Proceedings not seek to enforce or execute any judgment or decision handed down in the SPA Proceedings, pending the outcome of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections in this arbitration.\n\n54.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's application for an extension of the procedural calendar for the jurisdiction phase of the matter before the Tribunal and issued a Revised Procedural Timetable.\n\n55.\n\nOn 30 January 2020 the Claimant informed the Tribunal that a number of individuals had been convicted before the Turkish courts 'for their association with the Claimant, the Koza Group and/or the Ipek family' and requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to not take steps to enforce the convictions of individuals either subject to the provisional measures in Procedural Order No 5, or listed by the Claimant in Annex B to its application.\n\n56.\n\nOn 8 February 2020 and following the exchange of written pleadings by the Parties, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 10, denying the Respondent's application of 3 January 2020 for the forensic inspection of electronic devices. The Tribunal additionally proposed of its own initiative and in exercise of its powers under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(3) of the Arbitration to recommend that Mr Akin Ipek's computer be delivered into escrow and held subject to further order of the Tribunal.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal additionally ordered each Party to file and serve a witness statement from its duly authorised representative, 'verifying, to the best of the deponent's knowledge, information and belief after due enquiry, the completeness of that Party's production of documents (including documents held in electronic form) pursuant to PO No 8, setting forth the steps taken by that Party to ensure compliance with the Order'.5\n\nPO No 10, [30(2)].\n\n58.\n\nOn 14 February 2020 the Claimant applied to the Tribunal for confirmation that no breach of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No 1 arose from the use of certain materials in the present arbitration in proceedings before the English High Court. On the same day, the Respondent sought an opportunity to respond together with a counter-application that the Claimant disclose whether it had disclosed the Tribunal's Procedural Orders Nos 5 and 6 to the press.\n\n59.\n\nOn 17 February 2020, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's counter-application on the provision of arbitration materials. On the same day, the Tribunal issued its decision on the counter-application, deciding that, since Procedural Order No 6 had directed the Respondent to provide copies of Procedural Orders Nos 5 and 6 to the Ankara Criminal Court, those Procedural Orders were regarded by the Tribunal as having been placed on the record in open court.\n\n60.\n\nOn 18 February 2020, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimant's application of 14 February 2020.\n\n61.\n\nOn 21 February 2020, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 11, deciding that the Claimant had not breached the Tribunal's procedural orders or any general legal duty applicable in investor-State arbitration by the provision of materials for filing and use before the English High Court, and additionally dismissing an application by the Respondent for reconsideration of the Tribunal's decision of 17 February 2020.\n\n62.\n\nOn 3 March 2020, the Respondent applied for further relief with respect to the confidentiality of documents in the proceedings.\n\n63.\n\nOn 5 March 2020, having received observations from the Parties on 13 February 2020, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 12. The Tribunal recommended that Mr Akin Ipek's computer be held in escrow under the safe keeping of the Claimant's solicitors, not to be tampered with and to be held until the conclusion of the proceedings.\n\n64.\n\nAlso on 5 March 2020 the Parties, pursuant to Procedural Order No 10, filed witness statements relating to the completeness of each Party's production of documents pursuant to Procedural Order No 8. The Claimant filed the third witness statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, and the Respondent filed the joint witness statement of Mr Nevzat Avun\u00e7 and Ms Melek K\u00fcreeminoglu.\n\n65.\n\nOn 6 March 2020, the Claimant by email raised an objection to the Respondent's decision to file a joint witness statement from Mr Nevzat Avun\u00e7 and Ms Melek K\u00fcreeminoglu.\n\n66.\n\nOn 11 March 2020, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's Confidentiality Application of 3 March 2020. Also on this day, the Respondent filed its comments on the Claimant's objection to the Respondent's filing of the joint witness statement.\n\n67.\n\nOn 13 March 2020, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 13 on Confidentiality. The Tribunal ordered each Party, from the date of Procedural Order No 13, to treat as confidential and use only for the proper purposes of the arbitration: (i) the witness statements, pleadings, and expert reports (together with exhibits) filed by the other Party; (ii) documents provided by the other Party, whether in support of its case or in response to a document production request, that are not otherwise in the public domain; and (iii) the minutes or transcripts of oral proceedings in the arbitration. The Tribunal further ordered that neither Party is to disclose the other Party's correspondence in the proceedings without that Party's consent or leave of the Tribunal; and that save to the extent otherwise specifically directed by the Tribunal, the Parties are to treat the Tribunal's orders and decisions as confidential.6\n\nExcepting those procedural orders confirmed by the Tribunal in PO No 11 to be in the public domain, namely PO Nos 5, 6, 7, 9, 11; and PO No 13 itself.\n\n68.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, the Tribunal issued an Amended Procedural Calendar through to the Hearing on Preliminary Objections stage.\n\n69.\n\nOn 25 March 2020, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 14 on the joint witness statement of Mr Nevzat Avun\u00e7 and Ms Melek K\u00fcreeminoglu. The Tribunal decided that by 6 May 2020, the Respondent shall file and serve signed witness statements from each of Mr Nevzat Avun\u00e7 and Ms Melek K\u00fcreeminoglu in which each witness either '(a) confirms that he is able to and does, to the best of his knowledge and belief, depose as to truth of the entire content of the Joint Witness Statement; or (b) identifies which portions of the Joint Witness Statement (identified by paragraph number) for which he is able to give such a confirmation.'7\n\nPO No 14, [20].\n\n70.\n\nOn 31 March 2020, following the exchange of written pleadings from the Parties, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 15 on the Criminal Proceedings. The Tribunal declined to make a new order regarding the individuals in respect of whom Procedural Order No. 5 directed the cessation of criminal proceedings, noting that this Order remained in full force and effect and continued to apply to all stages of the criminal proceedings. In respect of the individuals listed in Annex B to the Claimant's application of 30 January 2020, the Claimant's application for relief was denied.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal additionally noted a dispute between the Parties as to the state of their negotiations concerning the conditions under which Mr Tekin Ipek was to give evidence. The Tribunal stated it remained available to the Parties on application in the event that aspects of these arrangements could not be agreed in suitable time for the preparation and presentation of Mr Tekin Ipek's evidence.\n\n72.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Respondent filed its Reply Memorial in Support of its Preliminary Objections (the '**Reply**'), together with the Legal Opinion of Professor Rudolf Dolzer (together with exhibits RD-1 \u2013 RD-32); the expert report of Nicholas Rostow (together with exhibits NR-1 \u2013 NR-40); the expert report of Valery Aginsky (together with exhibits VA-1 \u2013 VA-12); the expert report of Dr Williams Mazella; the expert report of Curtis Rose; the second expert report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli; the witness statement of Alpaslan Kuma\u015f; exhibits R-189 \u2013 R-351; and legal authorities RL-142 \u2013 RL-187.\n\n73.\n\nOn 22 April 2020 the Tribunal delivered its Procedural Order No 16 on the SPA Proceedings. The Tribunal decided that the Respondent, through the State organ acting as Administrator of the plaintiff in the SPA Proceedings, shall seek a stay of the SPA Proceedings pending the outcome of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections, as directed in Procedural Order No 5. The Claimant's request for additional relief was otherwise denied.\n\n74.\n\nOn 19 May 2020, the Claimant stated the Parties had been unable to agree on a protocol for the giving of evidence by Mr Tekin Ipek, and applied to the Tribunal with a proposed interim protocol that would allow it access to Mr Tekin Ipek on conditions, allowing Mr Tekin Ipek to prepare his evidence on a confidential basis with the Claimant's counsel. On 28 May 2020, the Respondent filed its response to this application, proposing an alternate protocol.\n\n75.\n\nOn 22 May 2020, in line with the earlier direction of the Tribunal,8 the Claimant filed an application for Witness 1's testimony to be admitted by the Tribunal on an anonymised basis, using the conditions outlined in the Claimant's earlier proposal for witness anonymity in its application of 17 June 2019. In the alternative, the Claimant proposed Witness 1's identity be disclosed only to the Tribunal (and if so directed, the Secretary of the Tribunal), with a proposed protocol for the taking of evidence during the hearing.\n\nPO No 4, [36(2)(c)].\n\n76.\n\nOn 9 June 2020 the Respondent filed its response to the Claimant's application for Witness 1's anonymity, objecting to the application and proposing a counter-protocol in the alternative.\n\n77.\n\nAlso on 9 June 2020, in accordance with a direction by the Tribunal for a second round of written submissions on the matter, the Claimant filed its reply on the protocols for the giving of evidence by Mr Tekin Ipek. The Respondent filed its rejoinder on 16 June 2020.\n\n78.\n\nOn 17 June 2020 the Claimant applied to the Tribunal for an order that the Respondent produce documents relating to the source and provenance of exhibit R-262, which the Respondent had filed together with the Reply on 3 April 2020.\n\n79.\n\nOn 26 June 2020, the Respondent answered the Claimant's application of 17 June 2020, seeking its dismissal by the Tribunal.\n\n80.\n\nOn 30 June 2020, the Tribunal permitted the Parties to exchange a further round of written pleadings on the Claimant's application with respect to exhibit R-262. In the Claimant's reply of 7 July 2020, the Claimant additionally sought the exclusion of exhibit R-262 if the primary source data for the exhibit were not produced. The Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Exhibit R-262 on 16 July 2020.\n\n81.\n\nOn 28 July 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties, in response to an application from the Claimant, that it had ordered a one-month extension for the filing of the Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections to 25 August 2020.\n\n82.\n\nOn 25 August 2020, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections (the '**Rejoinder**'), together with the expert report of Ellen Radley; the expert report of Thomas Moore; the second expert report of Professor Savas Bozbel; the witness statement of Selman Turk (together with exhibits ST-1 \u2013 ST-6); the second witness statement of Witness 1; the third witness statement of Ayhan Yurttas (together with exhibits AY-27 \u2013 AY-33); the fourth witness statement of Hamdi Akin Ipek (together with exhibits HAI-100 \u2013 HAI-111); exhibits C-205 \u2013 C-290); and legal authorities CL-133 \u2013 CL-236.\n\n83.\n\nAlso on 25 August 2020, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties concerning the hearing date for the jurisdictional phase of proceedings. The Tribunal considered that holding a hearing by videoconference would not best serve the interests of justice unless there were no alternatives. In light of that view, as well as ongoing travel restrictions and commitments of Tribunal members, the Tribunal re-fixed the hearing date for the jurisdiction phase for 19\u201427 July 2021.\n\n84.\n\nOn 12 February 2021, the Respondent sought to introduce revised English translations of two documents in the arbitration record, along with a number of new exhibits numbered R-391 \u2013 R-433. The Claimant objected on 15 February 2021.\n\n85.\n\nFollowing a communication from the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Parties on 16 February 2021 outlining the process for introducing new evidence following the respective Party's filing of its last written submission,9 on 1 March 2021 the Respondent applied for leave from the Tribunal to adduce the two revised translations, together with 31 additional documents. The Claimant filed its response on 8 March 2021.\n\nSee PO No 1, [16.3].\n\n86.\n\nOn 17 March 2021, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 17 (**PO No 17**) on New Evidence. The Respondent's application to adduce 31 additional documents said to relate to the identity of persons or IP addresses referred to in exhibit R-262 was denied, while the question of R-262's ultimate admissibility and authenticity remained for the Tribunal to determine at its Preliminary Objections hearing.\n\n87.\n\nOn 29 March 2021, the Respondent made an application for reconsideration of the Tribunal's decision on R-262 in PO No 17, to which the Claimant replied on 8 April 2021. The Tribunal decided that application by letter dated 24 May 2021. The Tribunal held that:\n\nHaving refused to provide more information about R-262 in June 2020, [Respondent] cannot be permitted, after close of written pleadings, to adduce further evidence in relation to R-262 now\u2026The material that Respondent wishes to adduce could, if Respondent regarded it as relevant, have been filed at the latest with the Reply in April 2020.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision in PO No 17 flows from its overriding duty to treat the Parties with equality and fairness in light of the decisions that each of the Parties themselves took about how they wished to present the evidence in support of their respective cases at the proper time so that their opponent could respond.10\n\nLetter from the Tribunal to the Parties, 24 May 2021, [5]\u2013[6].\n\n88.\n\nOn 22 April 2021, the Tribunal convened a case management videoconference regarding the oral phase of the Preliminary Objections. The Parties agreed that proceeding with the already fixed hearing dates (19\u201427 July 2021) online was both practicable, and preferable to a further adjournment.\n\n89.\n\nOn 28 May 2021, following two additional rounds of written pleadings (one round following the filing of the second witness statement of Witness 1), the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 18 on the confidentiality of Witness 1's testimony. The Tribunal issued a Protective Order in respect of Witness 1's identity, limiting disclosure of information reasonably likely to identify Witness 1, or his/her immediate family or his/her current location to '(i) members of Respondent's international counsel team; (ii) one member of Respondent's Turkish counsel nominated by Respondent; and (iii) one Party Representative in the Arbitration nominated by Respondent', following the signing and filing of a Confidentiality Undertaking.11\n\nPO No 18, Annex A, [1].\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal additionally ordered that Mr Akin Ipek not be present during the Closed Session in which Witness 1 gives oral evidence, but may review the transcript of the Closed Session following the conclusion of the Closed Session itself and the hearing of Mr Ipek's own evidence. The Tribunal further decided that the Respondent may adduce additional documentary evidence strictly limited to matters arising from the disclosure of Witness 1's identity.\n\n91.\n\nOn 30 May 2021, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No 19 on the Testimony of Mr Tekin Ipek. The Tribunal decided to exercise its own power under Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention (further confirmed by Rule 34(2)(a) of the Arbitration Rules) to call upon the Parties to produce Mr Tekin Ipek to give evidence via videoconference at the Preliminary Objections Hearing. Utilising this process, the Tribunal dispensed with prior service of a witness statement. Mr Tekin Ipek's testimony instead was to be taken orally, elicited in chief by counsel for the Claimant, with rights of cross-examination by counsel for the Respondent and re-examination by counsel for the Claimant. To allow Mr Tekin Ipek to prepare, the Tribunal decided that he was to be provided with a set of documents from the arbitration record relevant to his testimony and freely chosen for this purpose by the Claimant, as well as access to counsel of Mr Tekin Ipek's choice on a confidential and privileged basis to assist in preparation for his testimony.\n\n92.\n\nOn 2 June 2021, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal regarding the Confidentiality Undertaking annexed to Procedural Order No 18, stating the undertaking did not contain an express governing law or jurisdiction clause, and requesting the Tribunal revise the undertaking to expressly state it would be governed by English law and that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with the undertaking be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. The Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties the same day, confirming the Tribunal was in receipt of the Claimant's letter and had decided to make no revision to the terms of the undertaking.\n\n93.\n\nOn 7 June 2021, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, alleging that the Respondent had breached Procedural Order No. 19 by preventing Mr Tekin Ipek access to counsel of his choice. The Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to allow Mr Tekin Ipek access to visits from his criminal lawyer with a mobile internet-connected computer and mobile telephone to allow for confidential and privileged videoconference communications with counsel from Latham & Watkins, with such remote consultation to take place in a room that is confidential. The Respondent filed its response to the Claimant's request on 9 June 2021.\n\n94.\n\nAlso on 7 June 2021, the Claimant notified the Secretary of the Tribunal that Witness 1 had accepted to give oral evidence in the arbitration based on the terms set out in Procedural Order No. 18. The Claimant signed its confirmation of the Protective Order and filed a copy with the Secretary of the Tribunal on 14 June 2021.\n\n95.\n\nOn 11 June 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, conveying the Tribunal's determination of the Claimant's request of 7 June 2021 regarding Procedural Order No. 19. The Claimant's application for relief was declined, the Tribunal considering that, in light of Mr Tekin Ipek's status as the Tribunal's witness under Article 43(a) of the Convention, it would not be consistent with that purpose for Mr Tekin Ipek to be represented by counsel of record for either Party. The Tribunal also directed that any interview between Mr Tekin Ipek and counsel may be within sight but must not be within hearing of the Respondent's agents or officials, and that any communications between Mr Tekin Ipek and counsel are privileged.\n\n96.\n\nOn 14 June 2021, the Respondent applied to the Tribunal seeking a four-month adjournment of the hearing on jurisdiction to allow the Respondent to gather information regarding Witness 1's credibility. The Respondent's application also sought, upon production of the proposed confidentiality undertaking, an amendment to Procedural Order No 18 allowing disclosure of Witness 1's identity to representatives of the Respondent's Turkish counsel, an independent third-party investigations firm, and a number of Turkish State organs.\n\n97.\n\nOn 18 June 2021 the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's application of 14 June 2021.\n\n98.\n\nOn 22 June 2021 the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 20. The Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's application for an adjournment and for an expansion of the scope of the confidentiality undertaking *ratione personae.* In response to an earlier application originally made by the Respondent on 6 October 2020, the Tribunal ordered section [5.4] of the expert report of Thomas Moore filed with the Claimant's Rejoinder of 25 August 2020 to be stricken from the arbitration record.\n\n99.\n\nAlso on 22 June 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote two letters to the Parties, conveying decisions of the Tribunal. In response to a letter from the Claimant dated 21 June 2021, the Tribunal confirmed that Mr Tekin Ipek 'should be freely able to prepare to give his testimony; seek and obtain his own privileged and confidential legal advice thereon; and able to give his evidence without fear of sanction for so doing' and expected the Respondent to fully respect these rights of Mr Tekin Ipek without qualification. In response to a second letter from the Claimant dated 21 June 2021, the Tribunal stated that it had no objection to the Claimant's desire to correct two discrepancies in exhibit C-283 and invited the Respondent to indicate whether it had any objection.\n\n100.\n\nOn 28 June 2021, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, stating that it declined to execute the confidentiality undertakings annexed to Procedural Order No. 18, for the same reasons given in its application for relief dated 14 June 2021. The Respondent instead requested, under reservation of all its rights, that the Claimant present Witness 1 for cross-examination on an anonymous basis. On 30 June 2021, the Claimant accepted the Respondent's proposal, on the basis that the Tribunal and support staff would know Witness 1's identity and the Respondent only have access to the English interpretation of Witness 1's testimony. The Respondent filed further submissions on 2 July 2021.\n\n101.\n\nAlso on 28 June 2021, the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing organisational meeting by video-conference to discuss the draft Procedural Order circulated to the Parties on the organisation of the jurisdiction hearing, and the Parties' submissions of 14 June 2021 advising the Tribunal of areas of agreement and disagreement on the various items within the draft Procedural Order. Further to the discussions during this pre-hearing organisational meeting, the Parties each submitted on 2 July 2021 a revised Annex A, no agreement having been reached between the Parties on the Hearing schedule.\n\n102.\n\nAlso on 2 July 2021, the Parties filed and uploaded finalised copies of a List of Issues, chronology of key events and *dramatis personae*, a pre-reading list, a chronological list of all factual exhibits, and a core bundle of key factual exhibits.\n\n103.\n\nOn 5 July 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, conveying the Tribunal's directions in respect of the modalities of taking evidence from Witness 1. The Tribunal took formal notice, pursuant to rule 34(3) of the Arbitration Rules, of the fact that the Respondent did not comply with the provisions of Procedural Order No. 18 and the reasons that it gave for non-compliance. The Tribunal decided, considering the Parties' agreement (subject to their respective reservations) that Witness 1's testimony may be given anonymously, to accept Witness 1's testimony on that basis; however Procedural Order No. 18 would remain in effect such that the Parties have it at their disposal should they agree to avail themselves of it. The Tribunal directed that it will not receive any information (including that of Witness 1's identity) unless it is common to the Parties. The Tribunal directed that Witness 1 may elect to give testimony in either Turkish or English, that Witness 1's natural voice shall be subject to a voice distinguisher and he/she shall be able to give evidence from behind a protective screen. The Tribunal confirmed, in line with rule 35(1) of the Arbitration Rules and as confirmed in Procedural Order No. 1, the examination of Witness 1, as with all witnesses, is to be conducted under the control of the President of the Tribunal.\n\n104.\n\nOn 7 July 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, communicating the Tribunal's direction on the modalities for taking the testimony of Mr Tekin Ipek pursuant to Procedural Order No. 19. The Tribunal directed that Mr Tekin Ipek may give evidence from any hearing room at the prison campus or from the Ankara Court House from which a secure connection with FTI Trial Services' servers may be maintained; that based on the draft indicative hearing timetable Mr Tekin Ipek will begin giving evidence at the commencement of Day 4 of the Hearing (Thursday 22 July 2021); and that Mr Tekin Ipek's counsel may attend the examination but no counsel from either Party or Party representatives will be present in the hearing room. A prison security officer and IT technician may attend the hearing room but are directed by the Tribunal that they may not communicate with Mr Tekin Ipek about his testimony while he is giving evidence.\n\n105.\n\nOn 8 July 2021, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 21, setting out the procedural rules the Parties had agreed upon, or failing agreement, that the Tribunal determined will govern the conduct of the jurisdiction hearing. The Order provided for, *inter alia*, the date, time and format of the jurisdiction hearing; the order of proceedings and schedule (indicated in the agenda annexed to the Order); the time allocation between the Parties; the provision and management of several documents for use at the hearing;12 audio recording and transcription of the jurisdiction hearing; and several modalities unique to a virtual hearing.\n\nSpecifically, the Electronic Hearing Bundle, hearing summary documents, demonstrative exhibits, and electronic copies of documents in the arbitration record.\n\n106.\n\nProcedural Order No. 21 also set out modifications to the rules present in section 18 of Procedural Order No. 1 regarding witnesses and experts appearing at the jurisdiction hearing, such modifications accounting for the virtual nature of the hearing. The Parties being unable to agree on the matter, the Tribunal determined the following order for witnesses:\n\n(1) Melek K\u00fcreemino\u011flu [*testifies in Turkish*] [Respondent's witness]\n\n(2) Alpaslan Kumas [*testifies in Turkish*] [Respondent's witness]\n\n(3) Hamdi Akin Ipek [Claimant's witness]\n\n(4) Ayhan Yurttas [*testifies in Turkish*] [Claimant's witness]\n\n(5) Selman Turk [Claimant's witness]\n\n(6) Tekin Ipek [Tribunal's witness pursuant to Article 43(a) of the Convention and rule 34(2)(a) of the Arbitration Rules]\n\n(7) Witness 1 [Claimant's witness, to give evidence anonymously in accordance with the modalities set out by the Tribunal's direction of 5 July 2021]\n\n(8) Valery Aginsky [Respondent's expert witness]\n\n(9) Ellen Radley [Claimant's expert witness]\n\n(10) Thomas Moore [Claimant's expert witness]\n\n(11) Ali Pasli & Abuzer Kendigelen [testify in Turkish] [Respondent's expert witnesses]\n\n(12) Savas Bozbel [testifies in Turkish] [Claimant's expert witness]13\n\nPO No 21, [36] and [41].\n\n107.\n\nOn 13 July 2021, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, stating the Claimant intended to deliver to Mr Tekin Ipek witness statements prepared by Mr Akin Ipek and Ayhan Yurttas. The Respondent argued the provision of these statements would allow the Claimant to influence the testimony of Mr Tekin Ipek, the Tribunal's witness, and sought the prevention of their transmission.\n\n108.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's direction, the Claimant provided its response on 14 July 2021. The Claimant opposed the Respondent's application in full and argued that the provision of witness statements was compliant with para [28](2)(a) of Procedural Order 19. The Respondent, by email later on 14 July 2021, maintained its objection to the provision of the witness statements to Mr Tekin Ipek.\n\n109.\n\nOn 17 July 2021, the Tribunal Secretary informed the Parties of the Tribunal's decision that the witness statements of Mr Akin Ipek and Ayhan Yurttas are within the category of materials identified in para [28](2)(a) of Procedural Order 19, and are to be supplied to Mr Tekin Ipek in accordance with that Procedural Order.\n\n110.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction was held virtually via Zoom, and hosted by FTI Trial Services (FTI), from 19 to 23 July, and 26 and 27 July 2021, with oral closing submissions heard on 27 and 28 September 2021 (the '**Hearing**').

The Tribunal determined that Akin Ipek, having completed his evidence, should be permitted to participate in his capacity as a party representative during the taking of evidence from Witness 1,15 and to view a video transcript of Mr Tekin Ipek's testimony.16\n\nHearing T5/4/15\u20135/21.\n\nHearing T5/117/23\u2013119/15.\n\n114.\n\nOn 27 July 2021, following the examination of witnesses, the Tribunal adjourned the Hearing until 27 September 2021.\n\n115.\n\nOn 30 July 2021, the Tribunal outlined to the Parties its proposed order regarding the modalities of the oral closing submissions. The Tribunal proposed that each party be given three hours to make their closing oral submissions, over 27 and 28 September 2021. The Tribunal considered it likely that it would wish to put questions in writing to the Parties, and that it would give an indication by 1 September 2021 as to the questions it may wish the Parties to address in closing. The Tribunal lastly proposed that it would order each Party to file and exchange written skeletons of their closing argument by 20 September 2021.\n\n116.\n\nOn 9 August 2021, the Tribunal directed the oral closing submissions, including advance written questions and exchange of written skeleton arguments, to be managed according to the terms proposed by the Tribunal on 30 July 2021.\n\n117.\n\nOn 31 August 2021, the Tribunal Secretary, in line with the Tribunal's direction of 9 August 2021, relayed to the Parties the Tribunal's list of 11 questions to be addressed by the Parties in their closing submissions.\n\n118.\n\nOn 10 September 2021, the Respondent made an application to admit into the arbitration record the pre-2011 version of art 6 of the Koza-Ipek Holdings articles of association, in advance of the oral closing submissions. The Claimant submitted its response to the application on 17 September 2021.\n\n119.\n\nAlso on 10 September 2021, the Tribunal received a joint request for the introduction into the arbitration record of provisions of Turkish law together with their agreed translations. On 15 September 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit the agreed provisions and their agreed translations into the record.\n\n120.\n\nOn 20 September 2021, the Parties exchanged and filed written skeleton arguments in advance of the oral closing submissions.\n\n121.\n\nOn 22 September 2021, the Respondent applied to introduce into the arbitration record an arbitral award dated 20 September 2021, in which the Republic was also the Respondent. The Claimant submitted its response to the application later on 22 September 2021.\n\n122.\n\nOn 23 September 2021, the Tribunal ruled on the Respondent's applications of 10 and 22 September 2021:\n\na. The Tribunal allowed the Respondent's application to admit the pre-2011 version of art 6 of the Koza-Ipek Holding articles of association, considering that the text was not new evidence in any material sense, having been cited in part in the evidence of the Claimant's Turkish law expert, who had additionally been cross-examined on the subject.\n\nb. In respect of the Respondent's application to introduce an arbitral award as a legal authority, the Tribunal declined the application. The Tribunal considered that, as the Respondent was a party in the other proceeding (and had there been represented by the same counsel), it would have access to the record that the Claimant does not have. The Tribunal determined the introduction of the award, particularly within days of the oral closing submissions and after the exchange of written skeleton arguments, would place the Parties in an unequal position.\n\n123.\n\nOn 26 September 2021, the Respondent applied for its closing oral submissions to be bifurcated into an opening on 27 September 2021, and a reply following the Claimant's closing submissions on 28 September. At the opening of the closing submissions on 27 September 2021, the Claimant expressed its opposition to this course of action.\n\n124.\n\nAlso on 26 September 2021, the Respondent confirmed to the Tribunal Secretary that the agreed provisions of Turkish law, together with their translations, had been uploaded and introduced into the arbitration record, enumerated as exhibits R-446 \u2013 R-450B.\n\n125.\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Tribunal ruled on the application at the outset of oral closings, declining the Respondent's request for a split closing oral submission.17 The Tribunal declined a separate application by the Respondent to introduce into the arbitration record two redacted portions of the arbitral award that formed the subject matter of the Respondent's application of 22 September 2021.18\n\nHearing T8/5/7\u20138/1.\n\nHearing T8/14/16\u201316/13.\n\n126.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Hearing on 28 September 2021, the President enquired of counsel for the Respondent: 'does that then conclude both the evidence and the submissions to be advanced by Respondent in support of its objections to jurisdiction, Mr Sprange?' Mr Sprange replied: 'Yes it does, thank you.'19 Counsel for the Claimant gave the like confirmation.20\n\nHearing T9/157/23\u2013158/2.\n\nHearing T9/158/3\u201311.\n\n127.\n\nWhereupon, the President issued the following direction:\n\nThe Tribunal therefore closes this phase of the proceedings, both as to evidence and as to submissions. This means that there are to be no further submissions from either party, or applications to the Tribunal in respect of this phase of the proceedings, save only were the Tribunal itself of its own motion in accordance with the powers that it enjoys to seek further clarification itself from the parties, in which event you will be notified through the normal channels.21\n\nHearing T9/158/13-22.\n\n128.\n\nThe Parties filed their submissions on costs on 1 November 2021.\n\n129.\n\nOn 2 November 2021, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, arguing that the Respondent's costs submissions included supplementary submissions in support of its case on preliminary objections, beyond the scope of the Tribunal's directions with respect to cost submissions. The Claimant requested that paragraphs [4]\u2013[6] and [10]\u2013 [17] be struck from the arbitration record. On 4 November 2021 the Tribunal invited comment from the Respondent on the Claimant's request.\n\n130.\n\nOn 10 November 2021 the Respondent provided its response to the Claimant's request. The Respondent objected to the Claimant's request, arguing the paragraphs in question directly concern the cost implications of the Claimant's conduct in the arbitration. The Respondent argued that, should the relevant paragraphs be stricken, so too should paragraphs [12]\u2013[15], [18] and [23]\u2013[29] of the Claimant's costs submissions.\n\n131.\n\nOn 17 November 2021, the Secretary wrote to the Parties to inform them that the Tribunal had taken note of their respective positions on the cost submissions. The Tribunal will revert to the question of costs in Part VII below.\n\n132.\n\nOn 29 April 2022, the Respondent submitted an application seeking leave to introduce three interlocutory judgments of the English court in the case *Isbilen v Turk* into the record arguing that they \"have a direct bearing on the credibility of one of the Claimant's key witnesses in this arbitration: Selman Turk\".\n\n133.\n\nOn 16 May 2022, further to the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant submitted a response objecting to the Respondent's Application.\n\n134.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22 whereby it dismissed the Respondent's application to admit new evidence in the form of the three judgments. The Tribunal found that, in light of the closure of the evidentiary phase on 28 September 2021, 'it would be necessary for it to be satisfied that the case for admission of new evidence is exceptional because it is of such a nature to constitute such a decisive factor as to justify reopening the evidentiary phase, with all the consequences that would necessarily follow from that in due process terms.' The Tribunal found that the material that the Respondent wished to adduce did not begin to constitute such a factor.22\n\nPO No 22, [22].\n\n135.\n\nOn 8 December 2022, the Tribunal closed the proceeding.\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF PLEADED FACTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **K****oza** **G****roup and the** **I****pek** **F****amily**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThis arbitration arises out of a series of actions taken by the Respondent with respect to Akin Ipek, Cafer Tekin Ipek, Melek Ipek, Pelin Zenginer, Nevin Ipek and Ebru Ipek (collectively the '**Ipek Family**'), and the Koza Group.23\n\nRequest, [3].\n\n137.\n\nThe Koza Group is a group of Turkish companies, consisting of 18 companies operating across 11 sectors, including mining, construction, aviation, agriculture, tourism, and media, with a particular strength in the mining and energy sectors.24\n\nRequest, [32].\n\n138.\n\nFifteen of the 18 Koza Group companies are directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Ipek Family, while three have a proportion of their shares listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.25 One of the more prominent Koza Group companies is Koza Alt\u0131n \u0130\u015fletmeleri A.\u015e. ('**Koza Altin**'), a gold mining company acquired by the Koza Group in 2005. Following a 2010 initial public offering of a portion of its shares, approximately 30% of its shares are traded publicly on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.26\n\nMemorial, [15]; Request, [30].\n\nRequest, [6].\n\n139.\n\nThe Koza Group additionally includes a number of media companies that operated Turkish newspapers, television channels, and radio stations (the '**Koza Media Companies**').\n\n140.\n\nKoza-Ipek Holding, incorporated in T\u00fcrkiye in March 2004 by Mr Akin Ipek,27 is the Turkish parent company of the Koza Group.28\n\nMemorial, [14].\n\nRequest, [3].\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant, Ipek Investment Limited, was incorporated in England and Wales on 26 May 2015, with Akin Ipek and Tekin Ipek as founding directors, and Pelin Zenginer, their sister, acting as company secretary.29\n\nRequest, [12]; Certificate of Incorporation for Ipek, 26 May 2015, [RfA-33]; Memorial, [22].\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that it acquired the right to 100% of the shares in Koza-Ipek Holding on 7 June 2015 by way of a Share Purchase Agreement (the '**SPA**') in which it acquired the Ipek Family's more than 99% shareholding in Koza-Ipek Holding30 with reciprocal shares in the Claimant given as consideration, and that ownership of Koza- Ipek Holding's shares passed to the Claimant as a matter of Turkish law on 31 August 2015 by the endorsement of the share certificates to the Claimant.31\n\nThe residual shares in Koza-Ipek Holding not held by the Ipek Family are owned by the company itself: Request, [3].\n\nRequest, [3] and [31]; Share Purchase Agreement between Hamdi Akin Ipek, Nevin Ipek, Cafer Tekin Ipek, Ebru Ipek, Melek Ipek and Pelin Zenginer and Ipek Investment Limited (\"IIL\") and Koza Ipek Holdings A.S, 7 June 2015, [RfA-4].\n\n143.\n\nThe Respondent argues the SPA is a sham, meaning the Claimant is not an investor within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT.32 This factual dispute forms the basis of the Respondent's first preliminary objection.\n\nMemorial, [54]\u2014[58].\n\n**B. T****he** **R****epublic and the** **K****oza** **G****roup**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThis arbitration arises out of a series of actions taken by the Respondent with respect to the Koza Group, which the Claimant argues constitute 'a wide-ranging campaign to dismantle and expropriate the assets of the Koza Group.'33 The actions discussed in the Claimant's Request are as follows.\n\nRequest, [34].\n\n*Criminal Investigation into the Koza Group and Appointment of Trustees*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn May 2015, Koza Altin received a letter dated 13 May 2015 from the Turkish Financial Crimes Investigation Board ('**MASAK**') stating that Koza Altin was under investigation.34 The Claimant states that, despite Koza Altin's full compliance with the MASAK investigation at the time, the police then seized documents and computers from the Koza Group under a search warrant on 1 September 2015, based on fabricated allegations of criminal conduct.35 The Respondent states the May 2015 investigation and September 2015 search were the results of a detailed report by MASAK dated 4 August 2014 and a report of the Department of Anti-Smuggling and Organised Crime dated 3 March 2015 containing persuasive evidence of financial impropriety, and that the search warrant executed in September 2015 was judicially endorsed in light of those reports.36 An appeal against the search warrant by the Koza Group was rejected.37\n\nRequest, [41]; Memorial, [42].\n\nRequest, [41]\u2014[42].\n\nMemorial, [37], [40]\u2014[41] and [62]; MASAK Report No 2014/AR (71)\u20101 ('**August 2014 MASAK Report**'), 4 August 2014, [R\u201048].\n\nRequest, [43].\n\n146.\n\nOn 26 October 2015, a judgment of the Ankara 5th Civil Court of First Instance, pursuant to Article 133 of the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code, appointed 25 trustees to act on an interim basis in place of the existing boards of directors of 22 Koza Group companies, including Koza-Ipek Holding.38 The Claimant states this judgment relied on evidence obtained in breach of the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code, was contrary to Turkish law and could not have been reasonably made in good faith.39 The Respondent states this judgment was given in light of an Organised Crime Control Bureau report linking the Koza Group to what the Turkish authorities classify as a terrorist organisation led by Fetullah G\u00fclen, and have labelled Fetullah\u00e7\u0131 Ter\u00f6r \u00d6rg\u00fct\u00fc ('**FETO**').40 The Claimant states the Respondent has made 'widespread use' of allegations of terrorism against persons accused of association with G\u00fclen's followers (the '**G\u00fclen movement**' or '**Hizmet**'); that the Koza Group has no financial links to Hizmet; and that the Claimant has no knowledge of Hizmet possessing links to terrorism.41\n\nRequest, [44]; Judgment of Yunus S\u00fcer at the Ankara 5th Civil Court of First Instance, 26 October 2015, [RfA-6].\n\nRequest, [45]\u2014[46].\n\nMemorial, [70]\u2014[71]; Letter from the Province Directorate of Security to the Directorate-General of Security, attaching the KOM Investigation Report dated 19 October 2015, 3 December 2018, [R-108].\n\nRequest, [20], [43] and [66].\n\n147.\n\nMr Akin Ipek appealed the 26 October 2015 judgment unsuccessfully.42 Mr Tekin Ipek attempted to challenge the judgment at the European Court of Human Rights, where the claim was declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.43\n\nRequest, [50].\n\nRequest, [51]\u2014[52]; Memorial, [78]\u2014[79].\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimant states the Koza Media Companies suffered from the sudden cancellation of contracts with State-owned or controlled broadcast providers in September and October 2015, which combined with a 28 October 2015 police raid and the re-opening under editorial control of appointed trustees led to a collapse in their popularity. After Mr Akin Ipek requested their closure to avoid further losses in February 2016, the appointed trustees ceased the Koza Media Companies' operations and dismissed their staff.44\n\nRequest, [47]\u2014[49].\n\n*Relevant Legislative Action*\n-----------------------------\n\n149.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, article 133 of the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code was amended, allowing for appointed trustees to exercise the powers of shareholders in addition to possessing management authority.45\n\nRequest, [54].\n\n150.\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful coup attempt on 15 July 2016, the Republic declared a state of emergency, allowing for the enactment of emergency decree laws.46 On 1 September 2016, Decree Law No. 674 entered into force, allowing for the transfer of appointed trustees' responsibilities to a State organ, the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund ('**SDIF**' or '**TMSF**'), and envisioning an SDIF power to liquidate or close companies in respect of which trustees had been appointed if the SDIF was satisfied economic conditions so justified.47 On 6 September 2016, the Ankara 4th Penal/Criminal Court of Peace, over the Ipek Family's objections, ordered the transfer of the Koza Group's appointed trustees' functions to the SDIF.

As Koza-Ipek Holding had not registered a transfer in its share register, this judgment would purportedly apply to the Ipek Family's shares in Koza-Ipek Holding which the SPA seeks to transfer to the Claimant. The Claimant describes this judgment as 'arbitrary'; the Respondent describes it as based on 'strong suspicion and concrete evidence' of mismanagement of Koza Group assets by members of the Ipek Family.56\n\nRequest, [70]; Memorial, [100]; Order by Ankara 6th Criminal Court of Peace seizing the assets of the Ipek Family, 19 January 2017, [RfA-18].\n\n155.\n\nOn 17 March 2017, Koza-Ipek Holding, under the management of SDIF, commenced the SPA Proceedings at the Ankara 2nd Commercial Court of First Instance, arguing the SPA is a sham and therefore null and void.57 The Ipek Family unsuccessfully sought the recusal of the judges of the 2nd Commercial Court, arguing they had previously reached an unreasonable decision against the Ipek Family in a claim brought by Koza Altin's appointed trustees;58 after which the President of the 2nd Commercial Court submitted a criminal complaint against the Ipek Family's lawyer alleging libellous and threatening statements.59\n\nRequest, [72]\u2014[73]; Memorial, [106].\n\nRequest, [73].\n\nRequest, [74].\n\n**D.

THE PARTIES' CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nIn its Memorial on Preliminary Objections, the Respondent raises four objections to jurisdiction.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent argues there is no qualifying investment over which the Tribunal could have jurisdiction: firstly, because the SPA transferring the right to Koza-Ipek Holding's shareholding to the Claimant is a backdated sham; secondly and in the alternative, the transfer of Koza-Ipek Holding's shares to the Claimant was unlawful under Turkish law; and thirdly in the alternative, the Claimant has not made a qualifying investment under the BIT and/or the ICSID Convention.69\n\nMemorial, [112].\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent further argues the Claimant committed an abuse of process in submitting its claim to the Tribunal as, at the time of the Claimant's alleged investment, a dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent already existed or was foreseeable.\n\n164.\n\nIn respect of relief, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n1. Dismiss [the Claimant's] claims for lack of jurisdiction or lack of admissibility of Claimant's claims; and\n\n2. Order [the Claimant] to pay the Republic's costs of the arbitration, including but not limited to the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Republic's costs of legal representation and assistance, and all other fees and expenses incurred in participating in the arbitration, including internal costs, with post-award interest at a commercially reasonable rate.70\n\nReply, [347]; Memorial, [248].\n\n165.\n\nAt this preliminary phase, the Claimant requests the following relief:\n\n[T]he Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal:\n\na. Reject the Respondent's preliminary objections in their entirety;\n\nb. Declare that it has jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims and that the Claimant's claims are admissible;\n\nc. Declare that the Respondent has violated Article 47 of the ICSID Convention; and\n\nd. Order the Respondent to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the Claimant's legal and expert fees and disbursements and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID, with interest calculated at a commercially reasonable rate.71\n\nRejoinder, [568]; Defence, [175].\n\n**V. OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION: THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. I****s the** **SPA** **a** **s****ham****?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent argues the SPA dated 7 June 2015, by which the Ipek Family agreed to sell their shares in Koza-Ipek Holding to the Claimant in return for shares in the Claimant, is a sham backdated by the Claimant and/or the Ipek Family 'in order to manufacture the Tribunal's jurisdiction over their otherwise domestic complaints against the Republic.'72 As a result, the Respondent argues the Tribunal has no jurisdiction as a sham document cannot serve as its basis.73\n\nReply, [101]; Memorial, [115].\n\nMemorial, [143]; Reply, [172].\n\n167.\n\nThe Claimant argues that allegations of fraud impose a heavy burden of proof on the Respondent to support these allegations, and that the Respondent has not met this burden. The Claimant argues that it has discharged its burden of proof by producing the executed SPA and endorsed share certificates.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent submits the SPA is a backdated sham, and did not exist on 7 June 2015, the date listed on its face.74 The Respondent's submissions on this objection can be divided into five categories: (1) a lack of contemporaneous evidence pointing to the SPA's existence; (2) contemporaneous evidence pointing toward the existence of a materially different, unexecuted transaction concerning Koza-Ipek Holding's shares; (3) subsequent representations by the Claimant and the Ipek Family inconsistent with the SPA being entered into on 7 June 2015; (4) doubt cast on the veracity of the SPA by English and Turkish court judgments; and (5) the terms of and timeline surrounding the SPA itself.\n\nMemorial, [115].\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there is no contemporaneous evidence to indicate the SPA existed and was signed on 7 June 2015, nor to demonstrate the veracity of the Consent Document permitting the transfer of shares in Koza-Ipek Holding to the Claimant.75\n\nMemorial, [115]\u2014[122];

(2) the Respondent has not discharged its burden of proof to demonstrate fraud; and (3) the Claimant has introduced sufficient evidence to evince the validity of the SPA, Consent Document, and Endorsed Share Certificates.\n\nDefence, [125];

S****hould the** **T****ribunal decline jurisdiction based on non****-****compliance with T****urkish law applicable to the investment****?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent's second objection to jurisdiction states that, assuming *arguendo* that the SPA is authentic and validly signed on 7 June 2015, the purported transfer of Koza-Ipek Holding shares to the Claimant is non-compliant with Turkish law and thereby void, depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the question of compliance with administrative or procedural requirements of domestic Turkish law is irrelevant to the question of the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the dispute between the Parties, and in any event the formalities of Turkish law were complied with so as to transfer to the Claimant a right to the Koza-Ipek Holding shares under Turkish law.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments on this objection can be listed as follows: (1) the legal requirements under Turkish law for the transfer of shares were not met; (2) the terms of the SPA itself render it void as a matter of Turkish law; (3) the purported transfer of shares would in any event have been voided by Turkish legislation; and (4) non-compliance with domestic law operates to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over this dispute. The Respondent additionally submits the expert evidence furnished by the Claimant on Turkish law demonstrates a lack of impartiality,134 and that, for the reasons given in its first jurisdictional objection, the SPA would be unenforceable under English law as a false instrument.135\n\nReply, [180]\u2014[181].\n\nReply, [207]\u2014[210]; Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, [RL-186].\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the legal requirements for the transfer of shares under Turkish law were not met. The Respondent submits that while the SPA itself may be governed by English law, the validity of the transfer of Koza-Ipek Holding shares to the Claimant is governed by Turkish law.136 The Respondent submits that:\n\na. The Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence to prove the transfer of possession procedure \u2013 endorsement of share certificates by the seller and delivery of the same to the purchaser \u2013 has taken place.137 The Respondent submits there is no documentary evidence identified within the Koza Group's email correspondence regarding the endorsement of the share certificates, especially legal advice regarding the legal requirements for such transfer, and the logical inference is that no such documents exist.138\n\nb. The Claimant's letter dated 23 December 2016 to Koza-Ipek Holding was invalid, as it contains insufficient evidence of any transaction to allow the board of directors of Koza-Ipek Holding to be able, under Turkish law, to approve the transaction and register the Claimant in the share ledger.139\n\nc. The board of directors of Koza-Ipek Holding had the right to reject a proposed share transfer, and has not approved the purported transfer of shares to the Claimant.140 The Respondent submits that, in the absence of approval of the transfer by the board, under Turkish law ownership of the shares and all associated rights remain with the transferor.141 The Respondent submits the Articles of Association of Koza-Ipek Holding give to the Koza-Ipek Holding board the right to invoke an 'escape clause' rather than approve a share transfer.142 The Respondent submits there is no evidence of board approval in the prescribed form of a board resolution:143 Mr Akin Ipek, the Respondent submits, was not empowered within Koza-Ipek Holding's internal arrangements to approve share transfers on behalf of the entire board, and in any event this would involve a non-delegable function of the board per art 375(f) of the Turkish Commercial Code.144\n\nd. This position is supported by amendments to the Koza-Ipek Holding articles of association in 2011 that demonstrate an intent to limit the transferability of shares (in practice exercisable through the escape clause);145 legal advice given to the Claimant before the SPA's execution indicating the need for a board resolution;146 and the terms of the SPA itself creating an obligation on Koza-Ipek Holding to '[o]btain a Board resolution to approve the transfer'.147\n\nMemorial, [147]; First Expert Report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli, [12].\n\nMemorial, [152]\u2014[153].\n\nReply, [177].\n\nMemorial, [154]\u2014[157]; Reply, [187]\u2014[192]; First Expert Report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli [30]; Second Expert Report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli, [31]\u2014[37], [43].\n\nMemorial, [158]\u2014[160]; Reply, [183]\u2014[186] and [193]\u2014[194].\n\nMemorial, [158.2] and [160]; First Expert Report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli, [20], [22] and [41].\n\nReply, [173], [183]\u2014[186]; Hearing T8/122/11\u2013123/19; Second Expert Report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli, [14]\u2014[17] and [23].\n\nReply, [175], [193]\u2014[194]; Second Expert Report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli, [50], [55], [58], [74] and [90.14].\n\nHearing T8/129/16\u2013133/16; Hearing T7/104/8\u201316.\n\nHearing T8/120/8\u2013123/19; see also Second Expert Report of Professor Kendigelen and Associate Professor Pasli, [14]\u2014[17] and [23].\n\nHearing T8/127/3\u201323; Email from \u0130smail Bi\u00e7er to Okan Bayrak entitled \"Revised \u2013 Additional Info Notes\" with attachments, 10 June 2015, [R-56].\n\nHearing T8/127/24\u2013128/10; Share Purchase Agreement between Hamdi Akin Ipek, Nevin Ipek, Cafer Tekin Ipek, Ebru Ipek, Melek Ipek and Pelin Zenginer and Ipek Investment Limited (\"IIL\") and Koza Ipek Holdings A.S, 7 June 2015, [RfA-4], cl [5.2.1].\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent additionally submits that the terms of the SPA itself render the agreement void under Turkish law:148\n\na. The post-closing terms in clauses 5 and 6 of the SPA (requiring Koza-Ipek Holding any time after the closing date, but within three working days of the Claimant's demand, to approve the transfer of shares by board resolution, register the Claimant as the new owner, and compel the resignation of the Koza-Ipek Holding board for replacement) lack a commercial rationale. In the Respondent's submission, as well as indicating that the SPA is backdated, these terms indicate the SPA is a collusive agreement and therefore void under Turkish law.149\n\nb. The question whether Mr Akin Ipek had the authority to bind Koza-Ipek Holding to the SPA is to be determined by Turkish law, which imposes a duty on the individual to protect the interests of the represented company.150 The Respondent submits that there was a conflict of interest in his conduct in purporting to bind Koza-Ipek Holding to the SPA when, as an eventual shareholder in the Claimant, he would personally benefit from the operation of the SPA's penalty provision,151 and the SPA may constitute a 'fraudulent agreement detrimental to the interests of [Koza-Ipek Holding], and therefore the contract should be deemed null and void.'152\n\nc. The SPA contains terms contrary to Turkish law that render the SPA unenforceable and not binding on Koza-Ipek Holding. The Respondent submits the purported three-day deadline for Koza-Ipek Holding to approve the share transfer contravenes provisions in the Turkish Commercial Code prescribing a three-month period in which companies may object to a proposed transfer,153 and the penal provision in clause 6.2 of the SPA in substance operates as a guarantee of a share transfer, which is unenforceable as an attempt to circumvent article 380 of the Turkish Commercial Code (prohibition for a company to assist in the funding of purchases of its own shares).154\n\nMemorial, [161]\u2014[164].\n\nMemorial, [165]\u2014[167];

and (2) that in any event, the requirements under Turkish law for the transfer of shares were completed.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimant submits the arbitral case law, including that cited by the Respondent, states the alleged illegality of an investment will only lead to a consideration of the Tribunal's jurisdiction where the alleged illegality goes directly to the 'essence' of the investment.162 Relatedly, the Claimant submits case law indicates it is inappropriate to 'read in' a requirement of compliance with domestic law into the underlying treaty, which the Claimant argues is in effect what the Respondent asks of the Tribunal vis-\u00e0-vis the BIT.163 The Claimant submits the Respondent alleges only objections of a 'procedural or administrative' nature that do not come within this rule.164 The Claimant argues the Tribunal's jurisdiction is only barred where there is either no express treaty provision mandating host State legal compliance, but the illegality vitiates the State's consent to arbitrate,165 or where there is an express treaty provision mandating host State legal compliance, and the illegality constitutes 'fundamental' non-compliance.166\n\nDefence, [95];

Hearing T9/46/20\u201347/6, Hearing T9/49/1\u201310.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in any event, the requirements of Turkish law were complied with, in the following ways:\n\na. Firstly, the Claimant submits it has provided evidence that met the requirements to acquire fully effective ownership rights in Koza-Ipek Holding's shares through the Endorsed Share Certificates and in its letter dated 23 December 2016 to Koza-Ipek Holding.168\n\nb. Secondly, the Claimant submits the board of Koza-Ipek Holding did give its approval to the share transfer, and in any event such approval is not required.169 The Claimant submits the Koza-Ipek Holding board gave its approval by authorising Mr Akin Ipek to sign the SPA and by the Consent Document,170 and that, in a transaction such as the SPA where all shareholders and board members are parties to the transaction, approval of the transaction can be evidenced through execution of the transaction itself.171 The Claimant submits board approval in any event is not a requirement owing to a legislative change having the effect that Koza-Ipek Holding shares had 'been unregistered, and freely transferrable since 1 July 2013'.172 The Claimant submits the Respondent's argument that the Koza-Ipek Holding board had the right to exercise an 'escape clause' is based on misapplication of legal principle.173\n\nc. Thirdly, the Claimant submits the SPA is not void under Turkish law. The Claimant submits the SPA is not a collusive document and the Respondent's arguments are primarily factual claims related to the allegation that the SPA is backdated,174 and the SPA does not contain objectionable terms.175\n\nd. The Claimant submits that Mr Akin Ipek had authority to bind Koza-Ipek Holding and its board to the obligations contained in the SPA, and to approve the share transfer to the Claimant. Specifically, the Claimant argues that clauses 5 and 6 of the SPA do not call into question Mr Akin Ipek's authority to bind Koza-Ipek Holding,176 that the Koza-Ipek Holding board, through an internal directive, delegated to Mr Akin Ipek the full authority to approve a share transfer to the Claimant,177 and that the Consent Document in any event confirmed the board's approval to Mr Akin Ipek approving the share transfer.178\n\ne.

H****as the** **C****laimant made a qualifying investment****?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent's third jurisdictional objection argues that, assuming *arguendo* the SPA was validly signed on 7 June 2015, and the transfer of Koza-Ipek Holding shares to the Claimant took place in compliance with Turkish law, the Claimant's acquisition of shares would nevertheless not amount to an 'investment' in accordance with both the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Respondent argues an investment has not been 'made' under the BIT, and the *Salini* criteria are not met so as to create a qualifying investment under the Convention.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimant argues the transfer of Koza-Ipek Holding shares is sufficient to qualify as an investment as broadly defined in the BIT, that the *Salini* criteria are not applicable in this case, and in any event the Claimant's acquisition of Koza-Ipek Holding shares satisfies the *Salini* criteria.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent's submission on this objection can be divided into three heads: (1) the Claimant has not 'made' an investment that qualifies under the BIT; (2) the *Salini* criteria apply in determining whether an investment qualifies under the ICSID Convention, and the criteria are not met in this case; and (3) the Claimant's characterisation of the SPA as a 'right to purchase' agreement does not create a qualifying investment.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in order to qualify for protection under the BIT, the 'investment' must be 'made' by the investor, rather than applying to passive ownership of shares.180 The Respondent submits this position is supported by the wording of the BIT,181 arbitral case law interpreting a bilateral investment treaty that contained identical wording in relevant places,182 and other arbitral case law confirming that an investment requires 'at the very least, some contribution, or allocation of resources, by the purported investor.'183 The Respondent submits the Claimant has not 'made' an investment, and is merely passively holding Koza-Ipek Holding shares without any active participation.184\n\nMemorial, [187]\u2014[200]; Reply, [250]\u2014[253].\n\nMemorial, [187]; Reply, [251].\n\nMemorial, [188]\u2014[194]; Reply, [251]; *Standard Chartered Bank v Tanzania*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/12, Award, 2 November 2012, [RL-85] [214]\u2014[232]; UK-Tanzania BIT, [RL-90].\n\nMemorial, [195]\u2014[199]; Reply, [251]\u2014[253]; *KT Asia Investment Group BV v Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, [RL-20] [165]; *Orascom TMT Investments SARL v Algeria*, ICSID Case No ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, [RL-80] [372]; *South American Silver Limited v Bolivia*, PCA Case No 2013-15, Dissenting Opinion of Osvaldo Cesar Guglielmino, 22 November 2018, [RL-173] [100].\n\nMemorial, [200]; Reply, [250].\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent secondly submits the Claimant has not proven it has made a qualifying investment under the ICSID Convention, the jurisdictional conditions of which must be met in addition to those of the BIT.185 In respect of the Convention, the Respondent submits:\n\na. Firstly, that the *Salini* criteria \u2013 in which 'contribution, duration and risk' are treated as the 'minimum requirements for an investment'186 \u2013 apply to the interpretation of the term 'investment' under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT.187 The Respondent submits the Claimant must demonstrate whether the alleged investment meets the *Salini* criteria, as the assessment is necessitated by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which provides an objective outer limit to the definition of 'investment', independent of any underlying agreement between the parties to a dispute or the language of a particular bilateral investment treaty.188 The Respondent submits that arbitral case law demonstrates 'the mere act of acquiring shares is on its own insufficient' to quality as an investment under Article 25 of the Convention,189 the case law relied on by the Claimant accepts the applicability of the *Salini* criteria,190 and the criteria are also relevant for interpreting the term 'investment' in the BIT.itself.191\n\nb. Secondly, the Respondent submits there was no contribution made by the Claimant, either monetarily or in kind, as the SPA purports merely to transfer Koza-Ipek Holding shares from the Ipek Family to the Claimant in return for shares in the Claimant.192 The Respondent submits the act of receiving shares without payment for such is not a contribution, and the Claimant's failure to make a contribution is fatal to its claim.193 The Respondent submits the Claimant's argument that it acquired a right to manage the company and thereby satisfied the contribution criterion is wrong in law,194 and in any even the Claimant never in fact managed Koza-Ipek Holding's operations.195 The Respondent submits the Claimant's argument that declining jurisdiction due to non-satisfaction of the contribution criteria would reward the Respondent for wrongful conduct is misguided, as the Respondent's obligations under the BIT.only arise once the Claimant has made a qualifying investment.196\n\nc. Thirdly, the Respondent submits the Claimant has undertaken no risk, as it 'made no contribution in the course of its alleged investment and therefore did not stand to lose anything.'197 The Respondent submits the Claimant's argument on long-term commitments entailing risk is misleading, as 'risk related to hypothetical or planned future activity does not constitute a risk sufficient to meet the *Salini* criteria'.198\n\nMemorial, [201]; Reply, [224].\n\nMemorial, [201]\u2014[202]; *Nova Scotia Power Incorporated v Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/1, Award, 30 April 2014, [RL\u201078] [84].\n\nReply, [222].\n\nReply, [222]\u2014[225]; Expert Opinion of Professor Rudolf Dolzer, [10] and [17]\u2014[22]; *Saba Fakes v T\u00fcrkiye* ICSID Case No ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, [RL-28] [110]; *TSA Spectrum de Argentina SA v Argentina*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/5, Award, 19 December 2008, [RL-175] [134]; *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, [RL-168] [50]; *CMC Muratori Cementisti CMC Di Ravenna SOC Coop v Mozambique*, ICSID Case No ARB/17/23, Award, 24 October 2019, [RL-143] [191]; Christoph H Schreuer, 'Article 25 \u2014 Jurisdiction' in The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, [RL-149] [83], [117].\n\nReply, [226]; *Quiborax SA v Bolivia*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2012, [RL-26] [210]-[211].\n\nReply, [227]\u2014[229].\n\nReply, [230]\u2014[231].\n\nMemorial, [204]\u2014[206]; Reply, [233]\u2014[235].\n\nMemorial, [206]\u2014[209]; Reply, [240]; *Quiborax SA v Bolivia*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2012, [RL-26] [233]\u2014[234].\n\nReply, [236]\u2014[237]; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v Dominican Republic*, LCIA Case No UN 7927 (UNCITRAL), Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, [CL-110] [36]; *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No ARB/08/12, Award, 5 June 2012, [RL-145] [434]\u2014[435].\n\nReply, [238].\n\nReply, [239].\n\nMemorial, [210]\u2014[213]; Reply, [241]; *KT Asia Investment Group BV v Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, [RL-20] [219]; *Toto Costruzioni Generali SpA v Lebanon*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 September 2009, [RL-86] [84]; *Romak SA (Switzerland) v Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No AA280, Award, 26 November 2009, [RL-171] [231].\n\nReply, [242]\u2014[243]; *Doutremepuich v Mauritius*, PCA Case No 2018-37, Award on Jurisdiction, 23 August 2019, [RL-153] [147] and [91].\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent additionally submits that characterising the SPA as a 'right to purchase' agreement199 does not assist the Claimant on this jurisdictional objection, as\n\na contractual right, in the absence of subsequent economic activity constituting an investment, does not entitle a party to BIT protections:200\n\na. The Respondent submits a share swap does not merit treaty protection under the BIT or the ICSID Convention, as such an arrangement, absent the execution of a plan and intention to invest in the host state, lacks 'something tangible by way of enhancing the economy of the host state'.201 The Respondent argues that contractual rights under a valid but unconsummated SPA governing a share swap arrangement lack economic materiality in T\u00fcrkiye and do not meet the territoriality requirements of the BIT.202\n\nb. The Respondent submits that, until the transaction envisioned by the SPA is consummated through, *inter alia*, a resolution of the Koza-Ipek Holding board and updates to the share ledger, the SPA only creates a contingent liability of Koza-Ipek Holding to the Claimant, which cannot constitute a protected investment.203\n\nc. Lastly, the Respondent submits that, based on the post-closing obligations contained in the SPA, the transaction could only be said to be consummated, and thereby constitute a protected investment, following the demand letter to Koza-Ipek Holding of 23 December 2016, by which point the dispute had crystallised on either Party's case.204\n\nReply, [244], citing Defence, [76].\n\nReply, [245]\u2014[249];

(2) there is no additional requirement that an investment be actively 'made', and in any event, an investment has been 'made' by the Claimant; (3) the *Salini* criteria are not a necessary prerequisite to jurisdiction in this case; and (4) in any event, the Claimant's investment meets the *Salini* criteria.\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimant submits the BIT defines 'investment' broadly to encompass 'any kind of asset', including property rights, company shares, and claims to contractual performance associated with any financially valuable investment.205 The Claimant submits its investment falls within this definition, as the Claimant acquired property rights and the right to contractual performance in association with a valuable investment through the SPA,206 and acquired shares in a Turkish company through the endorsement of the Koza-Ipek Holding share certificates to the Claimant.207 The Claimant submits the case law is clear that, under the ICSID Convention and many bilateral investment treaties, 'contractual rights can give rise to a protected investment',208 and the authorities cited by the Respondent on the contrary view are either incorrectly cited or inapplicable on the facts of the present case.209 The Claimant submits the contractual rights to performance and entitlement to shares under the SPA merit treaty protection, irrespective of whether intervening acts left the transaction unconsummated or its benefits unrealised.210\n\nDefence, [75];

The Claimant submits that a contribution may take many forms and need not necessarily be monetary in nature.225 The Claimant submits its contribution in this case included its plans to 'make significant contributions to the Koza Group by way of know-how and the industry leading expertise of the UK-based management team', the provision of executive and administrative resources, and increased capital flows into the Koza Group as a result of greater investor attraction with UK-based ownership and headquarters.226 The Claimant submits the realisation of this contribution has been prevented only by the Respondent's wrongdoing.227 The Claimant finally submits the holding of assets is in fact sufficient to create a qualifying investment, and the Respondent's reference to authorities purportedly to the contrary is incorrect.228\n\nb. Secondly, the Claimant submits it undertook risk. The Claimant submits the Respondent is incorrect to argue there can be no risk without injection of financial resources, and that relevant arbitral case law indicates risk is inherent in any long-term commitment, and may include the political, economic, or juridical climate of the host State.229 The Claimant submits it undertook risk when it 'made its investment without certainty of when returns might be made on the investment or whether it would actually make any at all.'230\n\nc.

The Respondent argues 'this arbitration exclusively involves Turkish nationals engaged in an entirely domestic dispute', and only once the dispute arose or became reasonably foreseeable did Mr Akin Ipek 'seek to insert [the Claimant], an English registered company, at the head of the Koza Group's corporate structure, so that [the Claimant] could bring an ICSID claim under the BIT.'232\n\nMemorial, [214].\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant argues its claim is not an abuse of process that deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction. The Claimant submits the Respondent has not provided evidence to meet the high threshold for alleging an abuse of rights as an aspect of bad faith, or that a dispute was foreseeable as a very high probability. The Claimant submits a dispute between the Parties had not crystallised until after it had made its investment.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondent's submissions on this objection can be divided into (1) the appropriate legal standard and evidentiary burden; (2) the submission that the Claimant engaged in abusive nationality planning, which (3) means the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction as a result. The Respondent submits that, independent of the backdating objection, a finding that the SPA was abusively created in order to internationalise an already crystallised or foreseeable domestic dispute would also make the SPA characterizable as a sham.233\n\nHearing T1/5/18\u20136/1, Hearing T8/20/6\u201321 and Hearing T8/22/2\u201310.\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondent submits the legal test to be applied in determining an abuse of process is one in which the Respondent must demonstrate that 'a dispute of the same subject matter (and not any \"specific action\" of the Republic in relation to such dispute) existed or was objectively \"reasonably foreseeable\" at the time of the making of the investment.'234 The Respondent submits the Claimant is incorrect in arguing that foreseeability only applies 'where a Government expressed its intent to act clearly and publicly',235 or that the laws applicable to a dispute must not change in order for the dispute to be foreseeable.236 The Respondent submits foreseeability of a dispute does not require a specific measure to be foreseen but rather that the Parties foresee a dispute concerning the same subject matter,237 and that the Claimant relies incorrectly on authority in arguing that foreseeability requires a 'very high probability'.238\n\nReply, [256] and [258]; Memorial, [242]\u2014[243].\n\nReply, [259].\n\nReply, [261].\n\nReply, [260] and [262]\u2014[263]; Memorial, [244]; *Industria Nacional de Alimentos v.

That as criminal charges against the Koza Group arise out of connections with the G\u00fclen movement, in respect of which the Turkish authorities proceeded with a number of investigations commencing in December 2013, and considering media coverage indicating the Koza Group and Mr Akin Ipek had G\u00fclen movement associations, 'it was highly foreseeable that the acts of which [the Claimant] now complains would occur, and therefore that a dispute with the Republic had arisen or it was reasonably foreseeable would arise.'245 The Respondent submits the statements of the Claimant, the Ipek Family, and the reportage of the Koza Media Companies all indicate the Claimant was aware of or could foresee the dispute prior to the alleged investment,246 in addition to widespread media reporting on the prospect of State action against the Koza Group.247 The Respondent additionally submits that the foreseeability of the dispute is evidenced by the Ipek Family's actions in 2014, establishing Koza Ltd as a wholly-owned English subsidiary of Koza Altin with a capitalisation of GBP 60 million, which the Respondent submits was done in order 'to remove assets from the Republic that the \u0130pek Family could use when they fled to England.'248 Lastly, the Respondent submits the secrecy on the part of those involved in the SPA's creation is indicative of a foreseeable dispute between the Ipek Family and the Respondent existing before the investment date.249\n\nb. That the timing of the Claimant's alleged investment, absent commercial explanation, supports the argument that the Claimant took action to bring an anticipated ICSID arbitration against the Respondent:250 the Respondent submits that the timing of the purported investment and the claim are relevant factors when considering foreseeability,251 and the less than 24-hour period between the endorsement of Koza-Ipek Holding shares to the Claimant (31 August 2015) and the Turkish authorities' inspection of Mr Akin Ipek's residence and the Koza-Ipek Holding offices are of a 'striking proximity' unlikely to be coincidental.252\n\nReply, [270]; Memorial, [221].\n\nMemorial, [221]; Reply, [270].\n\nMemorial, [222]; Reply, [271]; Hearing T1/30/10\u201312.\n\nMemorial, [223]\u2014[224], citing \"The Great Escape\", Turkish Daily Newspaper, Takvim, 2 April 2014, [R-45], \"Arrest request for Dumanl\u0131 and Karaca\", 18 December 2014, [R-118], \"The last status in operation of December 14\", 18 December 2014, [R-119], \"December 14 Operation to the Community\", 17 December 2018, [R-120], and \"Samanyolu Head Hidayet Karaca and 3 others arrested\", 21 December 2014, [R-90]; Reply, [274]\u2014[277], and [283]\u2014[284].

The Respondent argues the Claimant had, in its Request for Arbitration, alleged breaches of the BIT dating back to 2015,257 on its own case alleging the dispute arose in August 2015.258 The Respondent submits the Claimant has sought to now characterise the dispute as crystallising on 1 September 2016,259 based on ascribing unwarranted significance and drawing incorrect inferences regarding the effect of Decree Law No. 674.260\n\nb. In respect of the date of investment, the Respondent argues the Claimant has claimed multiple dates of investment \u2013 7 June 2015 as the execution of the SPA, 31 August 2015 as the date of the endorsement and delivery of share certificates to the Claimant, and 17 October 2016 as the date on which the Claimant stated it issued Consideration Shares in return for the receipt of Koza-Ipek Holding shares261 \u2013 each of which the Respondent suggests are flawed.262 The Respondent submits that, by MASAK's letters dated 13 May 2015, the Ipek Family were 'on notice that the subject matter of the dispute had crystallized',263 and resultantly a dispute was either in existence or foreseeable by 7 June 2015, the earliest possible investment date.264\n\nReply, [326]\u2014[328].\n\nReply, [329].\n\nReply, [331], citing Defence, [62]. 1 September 2016 is the date of enactment of Decree Law No 674 [RfA-9].\n\nReply, [331]\u2014[340].\n\nReply, [341].\n\nReply, [342].\n\nReply, [344].\n\nReply, [342]\u2014[343], [345].\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, where restructuring in order to create treaty-based jurisdiction occurs after a dispute arises or is foreseeable, this restructuring constitutes an abuse, on the basis of which the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction.265 The Respondent submits that where a restructuring takes place in such circumstances, it is irrelevant whether there were additional or other intentions that may have also justified the restructuring.266 The Respondent also submits the doctrine of abuse of process is rooted in the broader requirement of good faith, non-adherence of which entitles the Tribunal to dismiss the claim in line with 'the inherent powers of arbitral tribunals to determine their own jurisdiction and to protect the integrity of the international arbitration system'.267\n\nMemorial, [236]\u2014[247]; Reply, [345].\n\nMemorial, [245]\u2014[246].\n\nMemorial, [218]\u2014[220].\n\n**(2) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimant's position on this jurisdictional objection is effectively twofold: (1) that the Respondent has misstated the correct legal threshold for determining whether a claim is an abuse of process, and (2) there is not sufficient evidence to suggest the dispute existed or was foreseeable as a high probability at the time of the investment. The Claimant submits the dispute crystallised on 1 September 2016 with the entry into force of Decree Law No. 674, 'long after the Claimant acquired its investment'.268\n\nRejoinder, [383].\n\n219.\n\nIn respect of the appropriate legal standard, the Claimant submits:\n\na. Firstly, that the doctrine of abuse of rights is an aspect of the broader principle of good faith,269 and accordingly the Respondent faces a high threshold in making out an allegation of abuse owing to the seriousness of the charge.270 The Claimant submits the Respondent's reliance on authorities to argue the use of circumstantial evidence is permitted does not affect the high threshold that faces a respondent State seeking to argue a claim constitutes an abuse of process.271 The Claimant suggests the high threshold associated with an allegation of bad faith led the Respondent to discard its line of argumentation on the good faith principle between its Memorial and Reply.272\n\nb. Secondly, the Claimant submits that arbitral case law confirms as a proposition that 'restructuring of a company's ownership structure in order to obtain investment treaty protection is not in and of itself illegitimate or abusive,'273 and that it is not an abuse of process for an investor 'to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host state in this way.'274 The Claimant submits these situations must be compared to those where the restructuring takes place against the backdrop of a pre-existing dispute.275 The Claimant submits that, when determining whether a restructuring constitutes an abuse of rights, the respondent State must demonstrate the restructuring 'was done for the sole or predominant purpose of bringing an arbitration claim under an investment treaty.'276\n\nc. Thirdly, the Claimant submits the Respondent incorrectly identifies 'foreseeability of a dispute' as the legal test to be applied: the Claimant submits a restructuring may be considered abusive if it is done in order to obtain international jurisdiction over a pre-existing dispute, or a dispute that is foreseeable as a 'high probability'.277 The Claimant submits the approach generally taken in characterising what is a pre-existing dispute and what is foreseeable as a high probability indicate that tribunals have 'only in exceptional cases found that claimants have acted abusively in restructuring their investments and declined jurisdiction'.278 The Claimant submits the Respondent is incorrect in stating foreseeability of a dispute does not require foreseeability of specific measures.279 The Claimant submits the Respondent's reliance on *Philip Morris v Australia* as authority is misplaced, as the tribunal in that case held that a restructuring may be an abuse of process where it takes place '(a) in order to obtain BIT protection (b) at a time when a specific dispute is foreseeable.'280 The Claimant submits the Respondent has overlooked the purposive element in *Philip Morris v Australia*,281 and that the case is in any event distinguishable on its facts.282\n\nd. Lastly, the Claimant submits that a foreseeability analysis is conducted 'from an objective viewpoint \u2026 as to whether the claim was in the reasonable contemplation of the investor'.283 Temporally, the question of whether the claim was foreseeable should be assessed based on the position as at 7 June 2015, when the Claimant's decision and intention to invest crystallised.284\n\nRejoinder, [389]\u2014[393]; *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV v Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/30, Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 September 2013, [CL-169] [273]; *Mobil Corp v Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, [RL-77] [175]\u2014[176].\n\nRejoinder, [394]\u2014[400]; citing, *inter alia*, *Chevron Corporation (USA) v Ecuador (I)*, PCA Case No 2007-02/AA277, Interim Award, 1 December 2008, [CL-87] [143].\n\nRejoinder, [402]\u2014[404].\n\nRejoinder, [380].\n\nRejoinder, [405].\n\nRejoinder, [409], quoting *Tidewater v Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, [RL-31] [184].\n\nRejoinder, [410].\n\nRejoinder, [411]\u2014[418]; Hearing T9/106/25\u2013107/2; *Phoenix Action Ltd v Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, [RL-23] [142]; *Cementownia 'Nowa Huta' SA v T\u00fcrkiye*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/06/2, Award, 17 September 2009, [RL-1] [154]; *Cervin Investissements SA v Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No ARB/13/2, Decision on Jurisdiction [Spanish], 15 December 2014, [CL-165] [292]; *OAO Tatneft v Ukraine*, PCA Case No 2008-8, Judgment of Paris Court of Appeal [French], 29 November 2016, [CL-205] [29]; *ST-AD GmbH v Bulgaria*, PCA Case No 2011-06 (ST-BG), Award on Jurisdiction, 18 July 2013, [RL-84] [415], [421] and [423].\n\nDefence, [140], [154]; Rejoinder, [419], [439], [443]\u2014[445], [447]; Hearing T9/111/1\u20133; *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v El Salvador*, ICSID Case No ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, [CL-57] [2.99].\n\nRejoinder, [420]\u2014[439].\n\nRejoinder, [446].\n\nRejoinder, [451]\u2014[464].\n\nRejoinder, [465].\n\nRejoinder, [467]\u2014[468].\n\nHearing T9/110/4\u201321; *Tidewater Inc v Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, [RL-31] [149].\n\nHearing T9/126/18\u2013127/14, Hearing T9/128/1\u201317 and Hearing T9/129/16\u201321.\n\n220.\n\nThe Claimant submits the legal standard has not been met, and the transfer of Koza-Ipek Holding shares to the Claimant was not an abuse of process.\n\n221.\n\nFirstly, the Claimant submits the Respondent has provided no evidence to indicate the relocation of the Koza Group headquarters to London was primarily, or even in part, done in order to gain protection under the BIT, despite the Respondent having access to Koza Group internal records.285 The Claimant also submits the Respondent's theory is inconsistent with the Koza Group's history of international expansion beginning in or around 2009, before the Respondent claims expropriation was foreseeable.286\n\nRejoinder, [470]\u2014[473].\n\nDefence, [142].\n\n222.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant submits the Respondent is incorrect to argue the dispute between the Parties crystallised by 13 May 2015. The Claimant argues the MASAK letter was 'innocuous' and 'gave no indication that Respondent would expropriate the Koza Group' or otherwise violate the Claimant's rights,287 that there is no evidence to suggest the SPA was executed in reaction to the letters and that such a theory is inconsistent with the chronology of the SPA's preparation.288 The Claimant argues it is unrealistic to suggest the May 2015 letters would render the seizure of Koza Group assets foreseeable, considering the use of article 133 of the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code to appoint the SDIF as management of the Koza Group in 2016 was 'novel and unprecedented'.289\n\nDefence, [165]\u2014[167]; Rejoinder, [476]\u2014[485]; Hearing T9/118/9\u2013120/18, Hearing T9/134/3\u2013134/14.\n\nDefence, [167]\u2014[168]; Rejoinder, [486].\n\nDefence, [143], [174]; Rejoinder, [488]\u2014[497].

The Claimant submits a dispute requires 'disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between two persons', based on 'clearly identified issues between the parties' giving rise to the claim.290 The Claimant submits the Respondent's argument that the dispute crystallised on 13 May 2015 ignores these requirements,291 and relies on irrelevant legal authority.292 The Claimant submits the dispute giving rise to this arbitration arose in September 2016, when by Decree Law No. 674, the Respondent through the State organ SDIF was appointed to replace the previously-appointed Koza Group trustees, as it was at this point that 'the deprivation of the Claimant's investment became permanent.'293\n\nDefence, [147]\u2014[150], quoting *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v United Kingdom),* Judgement, 30 August 1924, [CL-100]; *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v Spain*, ICSID Case No ARB/97/7, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, [CL-91] [94]; Rejoinder, [498]\u2014[503].\n\nRejoinder, [504].\n\nRejoinder, [505]\u2014[510].\n\nRejoinder, [510]\u2014[522]; Defence, [153] and [160].\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimant submits the Respondent's argument that, if not already in existence, the dispute between the Parties was foreseeable at the time of the Claimant's investment, must be rejected for applying the wrong legal test and for its evidentiary basis consisting of 'speculation and inference'.294 The Claimant submits the Respondent's evidence on the question of the dispute's foreseeability relies on internal Government documents,295 examples of general Government practices not specifically aimed at the Koza Group,296 and media and social media commentary.297 The Claimant submits the Respondent's theory that Koza Ltd was incorporated as a UK subsidiary of Koza Altin in order to remove assets from the Republic is speculative and ignores clear evidence of a legitimate business rationale for such a move.298 The Claimant submits the evidence indicates the MASAK investigation arose as a result of the Koza Group's prior decision to expand internationally rather than *vice versa*, and the timeline of MASAK's report, only finalised and issued in October 2016, postdates the Claimant's investment and cannot be taken as evidence the dispute had crystallised or was foreseeable by June 2015.299 The Claimant submits that the testimony of the Ipek Family, including Mr Tekin Ipek, to the effect that they did not anticipate an imminent seizure of assets or criminal proceedings against members of Ipek Family can be taken as an indication of what would be within the contemplation of a reasonable investor at the time.300\n\nRejoinder, [526]; Defence, [160]\u2014[161].

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. I****ntroduction**\n-----------------------\n\n225.\n\nIt is apparent to the Tribunal from the number and nature of the interlocutory applications that the Parties have advanced in the course of the proceedings thus far, that this dispute has been bitterly fought. On the merits, both Parties advance allegations of the utmost gravity. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent, in a flagrant abuse of State power, has expropriated the entirety of its substantial businesses in T\u00fcrkiye, as well as subjected its shareholders to grave human rights abuses. The Respondent, for its part, avers that those shareholders were or are members of a terrorist organization and colluded in or supported an attempted coup, which had aimed to infiltrate and overthrow the Government of the Republic. It maintains that the measures that it has adopted vis-\u00e0-vis the Koza Group's businesses in T\u00fcrkiye were and are in the proper exercise of its law enforcement powers.\n\n226.\n\nIf this case were to proceed to the merits, the Tribunal would have to consider these allegations against the background of the full evidentiary record then presented to it. However, those allegations do not fall for decision in the context of the present phase, which is concerned only with the Tribunal's determination of its jurisdiction and whether the claims advanced by the Claimant are admissible before it. This is the subject of the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**(1) Jurisdiction**\n--------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe present Tribunal, in common with all international arbitral tribunals, is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction. Those limits are set as a matter of international law by the ICSID Convention (to which both the United Kingdom and T\u00fcrkiye are parties) and the relevant instrument of consent, namely the BIT between the United Kingdom and T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal must decide whether it is indeed competent to determine the dispute. It is empowered by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention to 'be the judge of its own competence.'\n\n***a. ICSID Convention***\n-------------------------\n\n229.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, under whose aegis the Tribunal is constituted, provides, in relevant part that: 'The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State\u2026and a national of another Contractin*g* State*, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.*'301\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n230.\n\nThe importance of this provision is underscored by the final recital in the Preamble to the Convention, in which the Contracting States declare that 'no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention *and without its consent* be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration'.302 'Consent,' commented the Directors of the World Bank in their Report on the Convention, 'is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.'303 The Directors added that the consent of the parties need not be given in a single instrument: the State might extend an offer to the investor, to which the latter might give its consent by accepting the offer in writing.304\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1965), [23].\n\nibid, [24].\n\n231.\n\nThe Report goes on to point out that 'consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Convention, the jurisdiction is further limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.'305 Article 25 requires both a 'legal dispute arising directly out of an investment' and that such dispute be between 'a Contracting State' and 'a national of another Contracting State'.\n\nibid, [25].\n\n***b. The BIT***\n----------------\n\n232.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant invokes the jurisdiction of the Centre pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye for the Promotion and Protection of Investments 1996 (the **BIT**or **Treaty**).306\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 15 March 1991, [RfA-1].\n\n233.\n\nPursuant to Article 8(2) of the BIT, each Contracting Party consents to submit to the Centre for settlement under the ICSID Convention 'any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former.'\n\n234.\n\nArticle 8(1)(c) defines a legal dispute as one involving 'an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment.' Such rights include, *inter alia*, the protection of investments from expropriation under Article 5 'except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.'\n\n235.\n\nArticle 1(a) defines \"investment\" in relevant part as:\n\nevery kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively includes:\n\n...\n\n(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company;\n\n(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract associated with any investment having a financial value;\n\n...\n\n236.\n\n\"Companies\" is defined in Article 1(d)(ii) to mean, in respect of the United Kingdom 'corporations, firms and business associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom'.\n\n**(2) The Parties' cases on jurisdiction in outline**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, objects to the jurisdiction of the Centre and this Tribunal. In broadest terms, it says that the Claimant has made no investment in T\u00fcrkiye: (1) the document on which it relies as the legal materialization of its investment, the SPA, is a sham; (2) the Claimant did not obtain a valid title to the shares in Koza-Ipek Holding in accordance with Turkish law; (3) it acquired no investment that qualifies for protection under the Treaty; and (4) the claim is inadmissible as an abuse of process because the ownership structure of the Koza Group was only reorganized under a British company\u2013\u2013the Claimant\u2013\u2013at a time when the present dispute was reasonably foreseeable. In reality, the Respondent says, this is a claim by Turkish nationals against their own State, for which neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT provide any protection.\n\n***b. The Claimant***\n---------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is a British company and accordingly entitled to invoke the protections of the BIT and the ICSID Convention in relation to its investment in Koza-Ipek Holding in T\u00fcrkiye by pursuing its claim in arbitration before the present Tribunal against the Republic.\n\n239.\n\nIt says that: (1) the SPA is a valid document executed on 7 June 2015, pursuant to which it acquired an investment in T\u00fcrkiye; (2) Turkish law did not require it to take any further step beyond endorsement of the share certificates in order to perfect its shareholding; (3) its investment is constituted by its acquisition of shares in Koza-Ipek Holding by endorsement of the share certificates on 31 August 2015; alternatively it says that its investment is constituted by the SPA itself, as a claim 'to money or to any performance under contract associated with an investment having a financial value;' and (4) the reorganization of the shareholding in Koza-Ipek Holding under its ownership was undertaken as part of a business decision to internationalize the operations of the Group and not because the present dispute was foreseeable or foreseen at the time when the investment was acquired.\n\n**(3) Relationship between the Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nOn the Respondent's case, it would suffice for it to prevail on any one of its four objections. Each objection concerns the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or the admissibility of the claim in its entirety.\n\n241.\n\nAs summarized in Part V above, the Parties have advanced their pleadings on each of the four objections separately and seriatim. The Tribunal has been greatly assisted by the quality of these submissions and the depth of analysis of the issues presented by counsel in their submissions, both in the written phase and orally at the Hearing.\n\n242.\n\nYet, to some extent, the Respondent's objections advance alternative theories of the case. Its First Objection\u2013\u2013that the SPA is a sham\u2013\u2013proceeds on the basis that, as counsel put it 'the whole transaction is fake; in other words, it's a construct that was made after the fact'.307 Its Fourth Objection (abuse of process), on the other hand, proceeds on the basis that the steps that the Claimant alleges that it took, and the documents that were executed, were taken and executed on the dates alleged. It is precisely for that reason that the Respondent alleges those steps cannot give rise to an admissible claim because the dispute between the Parties that would form the subject of the claim was reasonably foreseeable. Nevertheless, the Respondent alleges that its argument under this head is still that the transaction is a sham 'because it was designed to internationalise a domestic dispute.'308\n\nHearing T1/5/20-21.\n\nHearing T1/5/24\u20136/1.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimant submits that 'there is a contradiction, or at least an inconsistency between these two theories.'309\n\nHearing T1/56/12\u201314.\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal, in addressing questions to counsel on which it invited closing submissions, put this point to the Respondent and asked it to address:\n\n(a) On the basis of what authorities in international law does the Respondent contend that its second alternative alleged meaning would lead to the SPA being described as a \"sham\"?\n\n(b) How, if at all, does this submission differ from Respondent's abuse of process argument?\n\n(c) Which of the two alternative meanings constitutes the Respondent's primary case?\n\n(d) What does Respondent submit in answer to Claimant's allegation that its first alternative case is inconsistent with its position on the second alternative?310\n\nTribunal's Questions for Closing Submissions, Qu 8.\n\n245.\n\nIn answering that question, the Respondent insists that its objections are alternative cases and not inconsistent.311 It submits, citing *Tokios Tokel\u0117s*,312 that the term 'sham' is equally applicable to its Fourth Objection as 'the label we ask you to put on the transaction as part of your conclusion that it's an abuse of process.'313 Nevertheless the Respondent also accepts that, in addressing each of the Second to Fourth Objections, '[t]he Tribunal need not consider arguments as to the true date of the SPA.'314\n\nRespondent's Closing Skeleton, [1]; Hearing T8/20/4\u20135, 15\u201321.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u0117s v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/18, Award, 26 July 2007, [CL-114], [10].\n\nHearing T8/22/8\u201310.\n\nRespondent's Closing Skeleton, [4].\n\n246.\n\nThe citation from the award in *Tokios Tokel\u0117s* on which the Respondent relies is not in fact concerned with the legal test for investment under international law at all. Rather, that tribunal is discussing the use of fictitious enterprises for purposes of money-laundering or tax evasion under Ukrainian law.\n\n247.\n\nIn the context of the present case, the Tribunal is not convinced that it assists its analysis of the Respondent's Fourth Objection to consider whether, for this purpose, the transaction is to be treated as a sham. On the contrary, a submission that a corporate restructuring at a time when the parties' dispute is reasonably foreseeable constitutes an abuse must proceed on the footing that the steps taken by the Claimant did take place when alleged. The question is whether they are effective to give rise to a claim of the Claimant that is admissible under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. On this question, there is an established jurisprudence, which, even if it differs on some points of emphasis (on which the Tribunal will revert later), indicates in broad terms the legal questions that must be addressed. These questions, and the evidence relevant to them, have been considered extensively by both Parties in their pleadings. The Tribunal will revert to them in Part C of its analysis.\n\n248.\n\nNevertheless, the development of this issue in argument underscores an important point that is preliminary to the analysis that is to follow. It is for the Tribunal to determine for itself whether any one or more of the Respondent's objections are well founded. For this purpose, it is not bound by the order in which the Parties have chosen to debate the Objections. It is for the Tribunal itself to characterise the issues to which the Parties' claims give rise and the order in which to address those issues.\n\n**(4) Order of analysis**\n-------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal will proceed to consider the issues in the following order:\n\na. It will first address a central issue that arises under the Third Objection (Qualifying Investment), namely: does the Claimant's acquisition of contractual rights under the SPA of 7 June 2015 constitute a protected Investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention?\n\nb. It will then consider the claim of abuse of process under the Fourth Objection, namely: whether the Claimant's claim is an abuse of process, being an attempt to internationalize an otherwise domestic dispute at a point when the dispute was reasonably foreseeable?\n\n250.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these two questions are necessarily linked. A decision on whether the dispute was reasonably foreseeable requires the Tribunal to ascertain the relevant date at which such a determination is to be made. This it may only do once it has decided when the Claimant acquired a qualifying investment.\n\n251.\n\nFor this purpose, the Tribunal makes the assumptions that: (a) the SPA was signed by Akin Ipek on 7 June 2015, and (b) the Share Certificates were endorsed by him on 31 August 2015. This is what the Claimant alleges. The Respondent accepts that the Tribunal need not consider the arguments in relation to when these documents were executed in order to determine its Third and Fourth Objections.\n\n252.\n\nIt would only be if the result of the Tribunal's analysis on these two objections were in the Claimant's favour that it would then be necessary for the Tribunal to go on to address the First Objection (SPA a sham) and the Second Objection (share transfer not completed under Turkish law).\n\n**(5) Evidentiary issues**\n--------------------------\n\n253.\n\nIn the course of the preparation of this case for hearing, the Tribunal has had to determine numerous contested issues of evidence: as to document production; electronic records and witnesses. Each Party has complained that it has been hampered in the presentation of its case by alleged failures of the other Party to produce relevant evidentiary material. Despite these challenges, the Tribunal now has before it a substantial evidentiary record, which includes both documents and other records, as well as witness testimony, tested under cross-examination when requested.\n\n254.\n\nThe evidentiary phase on jurisdictional objections is now closed and the Preliminary Objections must be decided on the basis of the evidence presented. As ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) provides: 'The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.'\n\n255.\n\nWhere particular issues as to the probative value of the evidence arise in the course of the ensuing analysis, the Tribunal will make its judgements. However, there are two preliminary points on the weight to be attached to particular pieces of evidence that need to be addressed at the outset on: (a) Exhibit R-262; and (b) the testimony of Witness 1.\n\n***a. Exhibit R-262***\n----------------------\n\n256.\n\nExhibit R-262 is alleged by the Respondent to contain messages sent and received by Akin Ipek over a secure message service called 'Bylock'. As already noted above,315 this exhibit has already been the subject of procedural applications, which the Tribunal decided in PO No 17, in the following terms:\n\n[10] R-262 was exhibited to the Reply. The Respondent gave no explanation as to its provenance in the Reply. It subsequently explained on 26 June 2020 that it was '*prepared by the Police Department'*. It is alleged to be '*a copy of Hamdi Akin Ipek's ByLock correspondence'* together with an additional 'General Evaluations' section. It does not suggest that R-262 itself is a contemporaneous document and has not disclosed the identity of those persons who prepared it or provide supporting evidence as to how they prepared it.\n\n[11] The Claimant did not initially seek its exclusion from the record. Rather, two months after service of the Reply on 17 June 2020 it sought disclosure of the primary source data from which the document was prepared.\n\n[12] The Respondent resisted this application, declaring that the Tribunal should simply determine the weight to be accorded to it in light of the Parties' submissions.\n\n[13] Only then by way of reply on 7 July 2020 did the Claimant seek the exclusion of R-262 in the event that the requested primary source data were not produced. In the course of that reply, the Claimant referred to press reports indicating that the data had been obtained '*through covert and illegal means'* (at [36], citing C-190), but it did not then seek the exclusion of R-262 from the record on that ground.\n\n[14] In the event, the Tribunal decided that the Claimant should file its Rejoinder on the basis of the evidentiary record as it then stood, reserving the position in relation to the ordering of further disclosure. This the Claimant did, submitting with its pleading the Moore Report which raises certain questions of a technical nature regarding the authenticity of R-262.\n\n[15] In the view of the Tribunal, this sequence of events gives rise to certain consequences for both Parties.\n\n[16] The Respondent has been on notice since 17 June 2020 that the Claimant disputes the authenticity and admissibility of R-262. It chose to introduce this exhibit without explanation as to its provenance in its Reply or in the witness evidence submitted therewith. It did not provide the source data requested by the Claimant. It bears the evidentiary burden of proving the authenticity and admissibility of this document and the allegations that it makes as to its link to Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek.\n\n[17] The Claimant has placed the authenticity and admissibility of R-262 in issue in its Rejoinder and adduced evidence in this regard, including the Moore Report. As a result, the Respondent knows the case it has to answer as to this document.\n\n[18] While therefore the Tribunal will not exclude R-262 from the record at this stage, it will determine the authenticity of R-262 and its probative value at the forthcoming Preliminary Objections hearing, in the light of the evidence that the Parties have placed before it as to its provenance and the Parties' submissions.316\n\nAbove [86].\n\nPO No 17, [10]\u2014[18].\n\n257.\n\nBy letter dated 24 May 2021, for the reasons stated therein,317 the Tribunal denied the Respondent's application for reconsideration of that decision.\n\nAbove [87].\n\n258.\n\nFurther, on 20 July 2021, during the second day of the Hearing, the Tribunal issued a further ruling on R-262, stating that the exhibit's authenticity, admissibility and weight, is an issue reserved by the Tribunal, to be considered in rendering its decision on preliminary objections; with the Parties free to put the document to witnesses of fact and expert witnesses during the Hearing.318\n\nHearing T2/117/20\u2013122/17.\n\n259.\n\nIn pursuance of that ruling, the Respondent put R-262 to Akin Ipek in cross-examination.319 He maintained that it is a fabricated document.320\n\nHearing T4/48\u201353.\n\nHearing T4/49/16\u201317.\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimant submits that R-262 is an unreliable document and no weight should be given to it. It states that it was created by unknown authors, who are members of the Respondent's intelligence or police authorities and purports to reflect data of unknown provenance.321 It relies on the report of its forensics expert, Mr Moore, who opines that R-262 cannot be authenticated, is unreliable and inconsistent.322 It avers that it is significant that the Respondent elected not to cross-examine Mr Moore.\n\nRejoinder, [171]\u2014[172]; Claimant's Closing Skeleton, [27].\n\nExpert Report of Mr Thomas Moore, pp [36]\u2014[38].\n\n261.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, considering both the procedural record in relation to R-262 and the evidence of Akin Ipek and Mr Moore, R-262 is not a reliable record of conversations that it purports to record. The Respondent refused to provide the source data from which R-262 was allegedly produced; nor did it call as witnesses the persons who prepared it. Both Akin Ipek, the alleged maker of the statements recorded on it, and Mr Moore, a forensics expert, deny its authenticity.\n\n262.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal excludes from consideration the alleged record of Bylock messages contained in R-262.\n\n***b. Evidence of Witness 1***\n------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the evidence of a Turkish lawyer, who, it maintains, assisted in the finalization of the SPA of 7 June 2015 and the Consent Document of 31 August 2015. It filed two witness statements from Witness 1 on an anonymized basis.323 As detailed above, the circumstances under which Witness 1's evidence might be admitted were the subject of detailed argument and a number of procedural orders prior to the Hearing.324 By PO No 18, the Tribunal had made provision for Witness 1's identity to be disclosed to a limited class of the Respondent's counsel and a party representative under a confidentiality undertaking and for his/her evidence to be given in closed session. The Respondent declined to execute the confidentiality undertaking provided for under PO No 18.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Witness 1; Second Witness Statement of Witness 1.\n\nNotably PO No 4, above, [39] and PO No 18 above, [89].\n\n264.\n\nOn 5 July 2018, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(3), the Tribunal took formal note of the fact that the Respondent did not comply with the provisions of PO No 18 and of its reasons for non-compliance. It decided that, in the circumstances, the Tribunal would accept that Witness 1's testimony be admitted and given anonymously. The provisions of PO No 18 would remain in effect should the parties wish to avail themselves of it.\n\n265.\n\nIn the event, Witness 1 gave his/her evidence anonymously and was subjected to cross-examination, save as to his/her identity.325\n\nHearing T5/6\u2013115.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the limitations inherent in the giving of evidence where the credit of the witness cannot be fully tested in light of his/her identity. It was for those reasons that it made provision for the giving of Witness 1's evidence in closed session on a confidential basis. However, the Respondent elected not to avail itself of this procedure. The Tribunal will consider the relevant portions of Witness 1's testimony, and will determine its weight in light of other evidence in the file and bearing in mind the limitations inherent in evidence anonymously given.\n\n267.\n\nWith these observations in mind, it is now possible to turn to a consideration of the first issue that the Tribunal has identified for determination, namely: does the Claimant's acquisition of contractual rights under the SPA of 7 June 2015 constitute a protected Investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention? For the reasons already discussed, the Tribunal will consider this question on the assumptions that (i) the SPA was executed on the date that it bears, 7 June 2015; and (ii) that the endorsement of share certificates in Koza-Ipek Holding into the Claimant's name took place on 31 August 2015. The legal effect of such an endorsement under Turkish law (second objection); and the question whether the SPA is a post-dated sham (first objection) are both reserved at this stage in the analysis.\n\n**B. Q****ualifying investment**\n--------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal will treat this objection in the following order:\n\na. First it will present the key features of the SPA that are relevant to the analysis of the nature of the rights acquired by the Claimant;\n\nb. Then it will specify the issues on qualifying investment to which this document gives rise in light of the requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention;\n\nc. Third, it will consider the Parties' submissions in light of those issues;\n\nd. Fourth, it will address the law relevant to those issues; before\n\ne. Fifth, reaching its conclusion.\n\n**(1) Key features of the SPA**\n-------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe SPA326 embodies the following key contractual obligations:\n\na. It is an agreement between the existing shareholders in Koza-Ipek Holding, being members of the Ipek Family (the **Sellers**), Ipek and Koza-Ipek Holding whereby the Sellers agree to sell, and Ipek agrees to buy, 100% of their shares in Koza-Ipek Holding: cl 2.1.\n\nb. Ipek agrees to give consideration for its purchase by issuing Consideration Shares to the Sellers at any time after Closing upon the Sellers giving 3 days' notice: cls 3 & 5.1.\n\nc. Closing is to take place on 31 August 2015 (unless the Parties agree otherwise) and at such place as the Sellers may determine unilaterally: cl 4.1. Closing is by way of the signing and endorsement of the Share Certificates by Sellers (or Akin Ipek on their behalf) to Ipek, upon which event '[t]itle shall be transferred': cl 4.2.1.\n\nd. After the issuance and delivery of the Consideration Shares by Ipek to the Sellers, Ipek is authorised to notify Koza-Ipek Holding in writing to obtain a Board resolution to approve the transfer and register Ipek as the new owner of the shares (the **After Closing Actions**): cl 5.2.\n\ne. If the After Closing Actions do not occur: (i) the Sellers have the right to ask compensation from Ipek; and (ii) Ipek has the right to ask compensation from Koza-Ipek Holding. In each case, 'The Parties agree and acknowledge that the fair market value of the Shares shall be the reasonable compensation': cl 6.2.\n\nShare Purchase Agreement between Hamdi Akin Ipek, Nevin Ipek, Cafer Tekin Ipek, Ebru Ipek, Melek Ipek and Pelin Zenginer and Ipek Investment Limited (\"IIL\") and Koza Ipek Holdings A.S, 7 June 2015, [RfA-4]. Save where expressly stated otherwise, the following summary adopts the definitions used in the SPA.\n\n270.\n\nThe final provisions include relevantly:\n\na. Clause 8.2, which provides that: 'Neither Party may, without the prior written consent of the other, assign, grant any security interest over, hold on trust or otherwise transfer the benefit of all or any of its obligations under this Agreement, or any benefit arising under or out of this Agreement.'\n\nb. Clause 8.9, which provides that the governing law of the SPA 'and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it' is English law and the Parties irrevocably agree that the English courts have jurisdiction to settle any disputes under it.\n\n271.\n\nThe SPA bears the signature of Akin Ipek on behalf of (i) each of the six Sellers; (ii) Ipek; and (iii) Koza-Ipek Holding. His signature is witnessed by Mr Selman Turk.\n\n272.\n\nSo far as concerns each of the relevant dates provided for under the SPA, the Claimant contends that:\n\na. The SPA itself was executed on 7 June 2015; and,\n\nb. The Share Certificates were endorsed on 31 August 2015.\n\n273.\n\nIn terms of the After Closing Actions, it is uncontested that:\n\na. The Consideration Shares in Ipek were allotted to the Sellers on 17 October 2016, according to the certificate received for filing at Companies House in London on 25 November 2016;327\n\nb. Ipek, by its London solicitors, Morgan Lewis, wrote to the Board of Koza-Ipek Holding on 23 December 2016 to give notice requiring the issue of a Board resolution approving the transfer and registering Ipek as the new owner of the Shares.328\n\nc. No such Board resolution was issued and Ipek was not registered in T\u00fcrkiye as the new owner of the Shares.\n\nIpek Investment Limited: Form SH01 - Return of Allotment of Shares, 17 October 2016, [R-68].\n\nLetter from IIL to Koza-Ipek Holdings A.S., 23 December 2016, [RfA-14].\n\n**(2) Specific issues**\n-----------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe present Tribunal is not called upon to determine a contractual dispute between the parties to the SPA. Rather, it is constituted pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n275.\n\nPursuant to the arbitration agreement in Article 8(2) of the BIT, the jurisdiction of this Tribunal extends to 'any legal dispute between that Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party *concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former*.'329\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 15 March 1991, [RfA-1], emphasis added.\n\n276.\n\nInvestment is further defined as 'every kind of asset' including:\n\n(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company;\n\n(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract associated with any investment having a financial value.330\n\nibid, art [1].\n\n277.\n\nIn the present case, ascertainment of whether the Claimant has made a qualifying investment for the purpose of the Treaty is linked to the question of timing. There can be no doubt that the Koza Group constitutes a major economic undertaking in T\u00fcrkiye. The critical question for Treaty protection is whether, and if so when, the Claimant, a British company, became the owner of that undertaking. Even on the Claimant's case, it did not become the legal owner of the shares in Koza-Ipek Holding until 31 August 2015, upon the Closing of the transaction by signing and endorsement of the Share Certificates. The Respondent disputes whether this on its own, and without the approval of the Koza-Ipek Holding Board, suffices in light of what it maintains are the requirements of Turkish law.\n\n278.\n\nThe date of acquisition is highly material in this case, because the question raised by the Fourth Objection\u2013\u2013whether the dispute was reasonably foreseeable\u2013\u2013has to be determined by reference to a specific point in time. For the purpose of the Third Objection, the Tribunal will proceed on the basis that the earliest date on which the Claimant claims to have become the owner of the Koza-Ipek Holding shares is 31 August 2015. As a result, it will be important to analyse the nature of the legal interest that the Claimant obtained prior to that date by virtue of the execution of the SPA itself on 7 June 2015.\n\n279.\n\nThe question whether the SPA, considered as at 7 June 2015\u2013\u2013the date of its alleged execution\u2013\u2013constitutes an 'investment' gives rise to two key issues:\n\na. *Subject-matter:* Is the SPA itself an 'asset' of the Claimant comprising 'claims to money or to any performance under contract associated with any investment having a financial value'?\n\nb. *Location:* Do the Claimant's rights under the SPA constitute an 'investment of [the Claimant] *in the territory of* [the Respondent]'?331\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n280.\n\nThese questions give rise to the following questions of interpretation and application:\n\na. Is a claim to performance of the share transfer under the SPA itself a qualifying investment constituted by a claim 'to any performance under contract associated with any investment'?\n\nb. Is a claim for compensation for Koza-Ipek Holding's non-performance of the After Closing Actions pursuant to clause 6.2.2 SPA a claim 'to money\u2026under contract associated with any investment having a financial value'?\n\nc. In each case, is such an asset an investment of the Claimant 'in the territory of' the Respondent'?\n\n281.\n\nThe issues as the Tribunal has framed them above are all essentially concerned with what is sometimes called the 'legal materialisation' of an investment.332 That is to say: they address the legal character of the claimant's assets or rights in property in the host State, the invasion of which by a respondent State may be the subject of a claim under the treaty.\n\nDouglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (CUP, 2009) Rule 22.\n\n282.\n\nIt is also often said that the requirement, in both a BIT and the ICSID Convention, that the claim be based upon an investment also denotes an economic materialisation. A 'commitment of resources' or 'contributions that have produced such fruits and assets.'333\n\n*KT Asia Investment Group BV v Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, [RL-20] [146], [166].\n\n283.\n\nAs it was put in *KT Asia:*\n\nThe assets listed in Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT are the result of the act of investing. They presuppose an investment in the sense of a commitment of resources. Without such a commitment of resources, the asset belonging to the claimant cannot constitute an investment within the meaning of\u2026the BIT\n\n...\n\n[A]ssets cannot be protected unless they result from contributions, and contributions will not be protected unless they have actually produced the assets of which the investor claims to have been deprived.334\n\nibid, [166]\u2014[167].\n\n284.\n\nIn their submissions on this Objection, summarised in Part V.C above, the Parties devoted considerable attention to issues related to the nature and extent of the economic materialization requirement:\n\na. The Respondent invokes the so-called *Salini* criteria in which 'contribution, duration and risk' are treated as the minimum requirements for an investment.335 It maintains that the Claimant did not meet these requirements.\n\nb. The Claimant submits that these criteria are not mandated by the BIT and that it would be wrong to read them in. It says that, in any event, if such criteria are to be applied, it met them in this case.336\n\nAbove[199]; Reply, [222] citing *Salini Costructtori SpA v Morocco,* ICSID Case No ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 31 July 2001, (*'Salini'*) [RL-29].\n\nAbove [204], [206].\n\n285.\n\nIt would only be necessary to reach these questions, in the event that the Tribunal were to find that the SPA creates an asset capable of giving rise to a legal materialisation of the investment.\n\n286.\n\nThe question of legal materialisation was traversed by the Parties in their written submissions:\n\na. The Claimant submits that when it entered into the SPA, and prior to the endorsement of the share certificates, it 'acquired the right to purchase the Ipek Shareholders' shares in Koza-Ipek Holding. It thereby acquired \"*property rights*\" as well as a *\"claim to \u2026 performance under contract associated with any investment having a financial value.*\"'337 It adds that the legal remedy provided under clause 6 of the SPA in the event that the After Closing Actions did not take place also constitutes such a legal claim to performance under a contract associated with an investment.338\n\nb. The Respondent submits that 'a simple right to purchase agreement does not suffice as an investment,'339 unless such an agreement is followed by 'subsequent activity that qualifies as an investment'.340\n\nDefence, [76(a)].\n\nRejoinder, [295]\u2014[296].\n\nReply, [244].\n\nIbid, [245].\n\n287.\n\nIn view of the potential importance of this point, the Tribunal invited the Parties' submissions in closing on the question whether the 'claim to compensation for non-performance of the post-completion obligation under clause 6 of the SPA' could constitute 'an [i]nvestment\u2026in the territory' of the Respondent.341\n\nTribunal's Questions for Closing Submissions, Qu 5.\n\n288.\n\nAddressing this question:\n\na. *The Claimant* pleads that its rights under the SPA include its 'right to performance of the transaction and its right to the shares in Koza-Ipek Holding, which is a company incorporated in [T\u00fcrkiye].'342 It submits that the territoriality requirement under Article 8 of the BIT is met in that its rights under the SPA concern 'rights to acquire shares in Koza-Ipek Holding, a Turkish company, and other related rights. Moreover, at the time of execution, all parties to the SPA other than the Claimant were based in [T\u00fcrkiye]and several of the post-closing obligations were to be done by Koza-Ipek Holding in [T\u00fcrkiye].'343 It adds that 'contractual rights to performance under the SPA also constitute an indirect investment in a Turkish company, which is within the territory of the Respondent.'344 It says that this contractual right to the shares constitutes an investment even if the transaction were not consummated.345\n\nb. *The Respondent* maintains that '[a] claim to performance under the SPA does not constitute an investment by [Ipek] in [T\u00fcrkiye].'346 It is not 'an undertaking in the host state of some commercial activity.'347 Specifically, it pleads that clause 6.2.2 'contained a contingent liability for [Koza-Ipek Holding], which previous tribunals have held does not qualify as an investment.'348 Rather it is a right 'between two holding companies and their rights to sue each other in England if one of them doesn't perform.'349\n\nClaimant's Closing Skeleton, [4]; Hearing T9/39/24\u201340/19, 49/3\u20136.\n\nClaimant's Closing Skeleton, [15].\n\nidem.\n\nHearing T9/43/5\u201312.\n\nRespondent's Closing Skeleton, [74]; Hearing T8/91/13\u201392/19.\n\nHearing T8/91/19\u201320.\n\nRespondent's Closing Skeleton, [75].\n\nHearing T9/150/18-20.\n\n**(3) The law**\n---------------\n\n289.\n\nThe importance of determining the legal character and location of the claimant's investment has been repeated and emphasised in arbitral awards. The tribunal in *Emmis* said:\n\nThe need to identify a proprietary interest that has been taken is confirmed by the definition of 'investment' in the Treaties. In each case, the Treaty refers compendiously to 'every kind of asset[s]' The Oxford English Dictionary definition of 'asset' is:\n\n(usually **assets**) an item of property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments or legacies.\n\nThe definitions in the Treaties go on to provide particular examples of types of property or rights that may constitute an asset for this purpose. But these examples are not exhaustive.350\n\n*Emmis International Holding BV v Hungary*, ICSID Case No ARB/12/2, Award, 16 April 2014, [RL-75] [161].\n\n290.\n\nThis point is particularly important in cases in which the claimant contends that contractual rights form the basis of its claim against the State. After a full review of the authorities,351 the *Emmis* tribunal summarised the position in relation to rights conferred by contract in the following way:\n\n[T]he loss of a right conferred by contract may be capable of giving rise to a claim of expropriation but only if it gives rise to an asset owned by the claimant to which a monetary value may be ascribed. The claimant must own the asset at the date of the alleged breach. It is the asset itself\u2013\u2013the property interest or chose in action\u2013\u2013and not its contractual source that is the subject of the expropriation claim. Contractual or other rights accorded to the investor under host state law that do not meet this test will not give rise to a claim of expropriation.352\n\nibid, [162]\u2014[168].\n\nibid, [169].\n\n291.\n\nThis point is equally applicable to the threshold question of the existence of an 'investment' for the purpose of the jurisdiction of the tribunal. It applies in the case of a treaty definition, such as that found in the BIT in the instant case, in which 'investment' is defined to include 'claims to money or to any performance under contract associated with any investment having a financial value.' This element, in common with all of the other limbs of the Treaty definition, forms part of a general definition of 'asset', that is to say: the claimant's property rights.\n\n292.\n\nThe distinction between purely contractual rights, which do not constitute an investment, and contractual rights constituting an 'asset' is basic to international investment law. It explains why an ordinary contract for the sale and purchase of goods is accepted not to be an investment. Such a contract undoubtedly has 'a financial value'; it gives rise to a claim to money or to performance; but such a claim is not 'associated with any investment' because it does not involve any commitment of capital in the host State.\n\n293.\n\nBy contrast, rights under a contract that are associated with an investment may well constitute property of the claimant that is a qualifying investment. An example is the agreement that was at the heart of the dispute in *Ampal-American Israel Corp v Egypt.*353 In that case, the Egyptian State entities had contracted with a private party to build and operate a gas pipeline, to carry gas from Egypt to Israel. An integral part of the arrangements was a commitment on the part of Egypt by contract (the Source GSPA) to supply a certain amount of gas on agreed terms to the pipeline. The pipeline had been built with the claimant's commitment of capital and was in operation before the acts of which the claimant made complaint. The claimant alleged that that contract had been unlawfully terminated. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the tribunal held:\n\nthe Tribunal accepts that, in order for it to find that there has been a breach of those standards in relation to the Gas Supply Dispute, it will need to determine as an incidental question whether the Source GSPA was validly terminated. However, this does not change the fact that the key issue under the Treaty\u2026is whether there has been *a loss of property right constituted by the contract*\u2026354\n\n*Ampal-American Israel Corp v Egypt,* ICSID Case No ARB/12/11, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 February 2016 [RL-144].\n\nibid, [255], emphasis added.\n\n294.\n\nThe tribunal in *Ampal* had jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in respect of the Gas Supply Dispute because the right to a defined supply of gas at a fixed price under the Source GSPA was a proprietary right under a contract associated with its investment in the pipeline in Egypt, the host State.355\n\nSee further *Ampal-American Israel Corp v Egypt,* ICSID Case No ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, [337]\u2014[347].\n\n295.\n\nSuch a proprietary right arising under a contract may be distinguished from other contractual rights, which carry with them no such proprietary consequences, such as the procedural rights attendant on participation in a tender bidding process considered in *Emmis.* As the tribunal there observed:\n\n[A] property right is something quite different. It constitutes a right held by its owner to the exclusion of others. It is no answer to say that the rights acquired by bidders in the 2009 Tender were acquired for valuable consideration. That may have created a contractual relationship between each bidder and the ORTT. But each bidder did not thereby acquire a valuable asset, capable of being alienated.\n\n...\n\nSl\u00e1ger's rights in the 2009 Tender were rights concerning participation in a process that would determine whether it could acquire ownership of an asset. Such rights could not, in the words of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, be 'freely sold and bought, and thus ha[ve] a monetary value'.356\n\n*Emmis,* [253]\u2014[254], citing *Amoco International Finance Corp v Iran,* IUSCT Case No 56, Partial Award, 14 July 1987, [CL-139] [108].\n\n296.\n\nWhat, then, is the legal nature of such proprietary rights created under contract? They are properly treated as a form of intangible property or chose-in-action and thus in principle capable of being alienated or assigned to third parties as assets.357\n\nAccord: Douglas 'Property, Investment and the Scope of Investment Protection Obligations' in Douglas, Pauwelyn & Vi\u00f1uales *The Foundations of International Investment Law* (OUP, 2014) Ch 12, 382-7.\n\n297.\n\nSuch a chose in action is, as a general rule, located in the country in which it is properly recoverable or can be enforced.358\n\nLord Collins et al (eds), *Dicey, Morris & Collins on the Conflict of Laws* (Sweet & Maxwell, 2012) Rule 129(1).\n\n298.\n\nIn argument, the Parties have referred to a number of arbitral decisions. These are of some relevance as a guide to this Tribunal's decision.\n\n299.\n\n*Almasryia v Kuwait*359 is most on point. In that case, the claimant relied for its investment on a joint venture agreement, into which it had entered with a Kuwaiti national, for the development of a parcel of land in Kuwait. Its treaty claim was that the respondent had expropriated its investment by preventing it from taking ownership of the land. The tribunal held, citing *Emmis* with approval, that 'a promise between two private parties contained in a private instrument, which has not been sanctioned or recognized by the host state, cannot be the basis of a property title.'360\n\n*Almasryia v Kuwait,* ICSID Case No ARB/18/2, Award under ICSID Rule 41(5), 1 November 2019, [RL-142].\n\nibid, [56].\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimant in the present case pleads that this case is distinguishable as the seller had no title to the land in the first place that it could transfer.361 This observation is correct so far as it goes; but, in the Tribunal's view, it does not answer the fundamental point about the distinction between private contractual rights and title to property.\n\nRejoinder, [305]\u2014[306].\n\n301.\n\nIn *Joy Mining v Egypt,*362 the tribunal rejected the claimant's claim to found its investment claim on the alleged failure to release a bank guarantee that it had provided in connection with the financing of a project in Egypt. The relevant BIT contained language similar to that found in Art 1(a)(iii) in the present case, which included within the scope of the concept of investment 'claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value.' The tribunal held that: 'Even if a claim to return of performance and related guarantees has a financial value it cannot amount to recharacterizing as an investment dispute a dispute which in essence concerns a contingent liability.'363\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Ltd v Egypt,* ICSID Case No AB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, [RL-168].\n\nibid, [47].\n\n302.\n\nIn *Eureko v Poland*,364 the claimant and the respondent had entered into an agreement pursuant to which the claimant had bought a shareholding in a state insurance company. Pursuant to that agreement, the claimant had obtained certain management rights in connection with the company. The respondent had subsequently committed to assist the claimant in exercising a right to acquire further shares. The tribunal had 'a measure of hesitation in finding that Eureko's corporate governance rights under the SPA, standing alone, qualify as an investment under the Treaty.' The critical element, in its view, was the critical connection between those rights and the making of Eureko's EUR700 million investment.365 It held that the subsequent agreement evidenced 'a firm commitment of the State Treasury' which it had accepted constituted 'acquired rights' of the claimant.366\n\n*Eureko BV v Poland,* Partial Award, 19 August 2005[CL-178].\n\nibid, [144].\n\nibid, [152]\u2014[160].\n\n303.\n\nIn that case, the contract in question had been entered into directly as between the claimant and an organ of the respondent State. In reliance on it, the claimant had made a substantial economic contribution in the respondent State. In these circumstances, the attendant rights that the claimant had obtained were an integral part of the investment.\n\n304.\n\nIn *Gavazzi v Romania,*367 the claimants had completed their purchase of a 70% shareholding in the Romanian company that was being privatised by paying the agreed purchase price.368 As a result, it is unsurprising that the tribunal was satisfied that they had made a qualifying investment.369\n\n*Gavazzi v Romania,* ICSID Case No ARB/12/25, Decision on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Liability, 21 April 2015 [CL-200].\n\nibid, [57].\n\nibid, [94]\u2014[95].\n\n305.\n\nPausing at this point in the analysis, the Tribunal arrives at the following findings of law:\n\na. The BIT and the ICSID Convention protect an 'investment' of a company of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party;\n\nb. The term 'investment' denotes an 'asset' that belongs to the claimant, that is to say: property of the claimant. Each of the sub-paragraphs of the definition of investment, including Article 1(a)(iii), is to be so construed.\n\nc. Such a proprietary interest may be created by contract, but this does not mean that all contractual rights are to be treated as proprietary. What matters is whether the particular right may properly be treated as a form of intangible property\u2013\u2013a chose in action\u2013\u2013i.e., something that is itself in principle capable of being bought and sold.\n\nd. The BIT protects only those investments that are made 'in the territory of' the respondent state.\n\ne. A chose in action is located in the territory of the country in which it is properly recoverable or can be enforced.\n\n**(4) Application of the law to the rights under the SPA**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nApplying these findings to the facts of the present case, the Tribunal has no difficulty in accepting that the Claimant's ownership of the shares in Koza-Ipek Holding would constitute the legal materialisation of its investment in T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n307.\n\nThis would still leave open the question whether the Claimant did validly acquire the shares on 31 August 2015 upon signature and delivery of the Share Certificates\u2013\u2013the issue that is the subject of the Respondent's Second Objection. It would also leave for determination the question of whether, and if so, what form of economic materialization on the part of the Claimant might be necessary. This question would include whether the issue of the Consideration Shares, which did not take place until 25 November 2016, forms an essential element of the investment.\n\n308.\n\nHowever, the question that the Tribunal is currently considering is simply whether, on the assumption that the SPA was entered into on 7 June 2015 as the Claimant contends, the rights that it acquired pursuant to that document themselves constitute an investment of the Claimant in the territory of the Respondent sufficient to qualify for protection under the BIT.\n\n309.\n\nThe conclusion that the Tribunal has reached is that they did not so qualify. The SPA is, as its express terms state, an agreement to purchase shares in Koza-Ipek Holding on a future date. The date nominated for Closing in the SPA is 31 August 2015. The Agreement further provides that the Closing Date may be changed if all Parties agree in writing. As at 7 June 2015, the Claimant had contractual rights vis-\u00e0-vis the Sellers to require Closing. It also had certain contractual rights vis-\u00e0-vis Koza-Ipek Holding as to After Closing Actions, with remedies against Koza-Ipek Holding in the event of non-performance. But the SPA expressly states that 'title shall be transferred' on Closing. The inescapable conclusion is that the Parties' intention was that the contract would produce proprietary effects only on Closing.\n\n310.\n\nIn the interim, the Parties had personal contractual obligations. These were not capable of assignment or transfer by the Claimant unless all Parties were to consent. The SPA does not create a chose in action as at 7 June 2015. Rather, it binds the Parties contractually to take certain actions subsequently that, if and when validly taken, would then give rise to a property interest in T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n311.\n\nThe fact that the After Closing Actions are to take place in T\u00fcrkiye supports this conclusion, rather than undermining it, since all of these actions are, in the SPA's terms to take place *after* title has been transferred at Closing.\n\n312.\n\nSome reliance was also placed on clause 6.2.2 of the SPA by which the Claimant acquired a cause of action for the fair market value of the shares against Koza-Ipek Holding in the event that it were to fail in its obligations vis-\u00e0-vis After Closing Actions. The creation of this contractual claim does not constitute an investment by the Claimant in T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n313.\n\nSuch a claim would, if it were capable of being pursued, require the Claimant to establish that\u2013\u2013not the Sellers\u2013\u2013but the very Company in which it was making its investment could be under a legally enforceable obligation to pay damages comprising its entire value to its own shareholder in the event that it were to fail to take the After Closing Actions, thus eviscerating the entire investment. Such a proposition needs only to be stated for it to be plain that this is the very opposite of the concept of investment. It would involve the outflow from the territory of the respondent State of the investment, not its inflow.\n\n314.\n\nIn any event, such a claim is, in accordance with clause 8.9 of the SPA, governed by English law and to be settled in the English courts. If it were capable of being construed as a chose in action, it would be situated in England where it is properly recoverable or to be enforced.\n\n315.\n\nThe result is that, in the Tribunal's view:\n\na. The SPA did not itself constitute a qualifying investment for the purpose of jurisdiction under the BIT.\n\nb. The earliest date upon which it could be said that the Claimant had an investment in T\u00fcrkiye is 31 August 2015, being the date of endorsement of the Share Certificates and not before.\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal will now proceed to address the Respondent's Fourth Objection in light of these findings.\n\n**C. A****buse of** **P****rocess**\n-----------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe overall issue raised by the Respondent's fourth objection is whether the claim is an abuse of process, being an attempt to internationalise an otherwise domestic dispute at a point when the dispute was reasonably foreseeable.\n\n**(1) Legal test**\n------------------\n\n318.\n\nThe concept of abuse of process, as applied to the jurisdiction of an international investment tribunal is an aspect of the general principle of good faith. The underlying rationale was well explained by the tribunal in the seminal case of *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic* when it found that:\n\nThe unique goal of the \"investment\" was to transform a pre-existing domestic dispute into an international dispute subject to ICSID arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty. This kind of transaction is not a *bona fide* transaction and cannot be a protected investment under the ICSID system.\n\n...\n\nIf it were accepted that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide Phoenix's claim, then any pre-existing national dispute could be brought to an ICSID tribunal by a transfer of the national economic interests to a foreign company in an attempt to seek protections under a BIT. Such a transfer from the domestic arena to the international scene would *ipso facto* constitute a \"protected investment\" \u2013 and the jurisdiction of BIT and ICSID tribunals would be virtually unlimited. It is the duty of the Tribunal not to protect such an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs. It is indeed the Tribunal's view that to accept jurisdiction in this case would go against the basic objectives underlying the ICSID Convention as well as those of bilateral investment treaties. The Tribunal has to ensure that the ICSID mechanism does not protect investments that it was not designed to protect, because they are in essence domestic investments disguised as international investments for the sole purpose of access to this mechanism.370\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, [RL-23] [142], [144].\n\n319.\n\nThe *Phoenix Action* tribunal speaks in terms of a 'pre-existing dispute'. It is now accepted that this term encompasses not only a dispute in which the parties are already engaged, but also one that is reasonably foreseeable. Indeed, this latter context may be the true context in which the doctrine is applicable. As was pointed out in *Levy v Peru,* '[i]f a claimant acquires an investment after the date on which the challenged act occurred, the tribunal will normally lack jurisdiction *ratione temporis* and there will be no room for an abuse of process.'371 In that case, the investor was found to have acquired her investment slightly before the challenged measure and it was therefore relevant to determine whether such acquisition was abusive because the dispute was then reasonably foreseeable.\n\n*Levy v Peru,* ICSID Case No ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015, [RL-5] [182].\n\n***a. Reasonable foreseeability***\n----------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nAs a matter of law, a distinction is to be drawn between the restructuring of an investment at a time:\n\na. when the investor seeks 'to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host state',372 which is a legitimate goal and no abuse of an investment protection treaty; and,\n\nb. when a specific dispute was foreseeable, namely, 'when there is a reasonable prospect\u2026that a measure which may give rise to a treaty claim will materialise.'373\n\n*Tidewater Inc v Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, [RL-31] [184].\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Ltd v Australia*, PCA Case No 2012-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, [RL-81] [554].\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal asked the Parties: 'What is it that, as a matter of international law, must be reasonably foreseeable for the claim to constitute an abuse of process by reason of corporate restructuring that (it is alleged) made Claimant, rather than the members of the Ipek Family, the owner of Koza-Ipek Holdings?'374\n\nTribunal's Questions for Closing Submissions, Qu 9.\n\n322.\n\nIn response, the Parties placed different emphases on the test:\n\na. The Respondent draws the conclusion from the test cited above that the Claimant 'did not need to foresee the specific measure that the Republic ultimately would enact or apply in alleged breach of the Treaty.'375\n\nb. The Claimant emphasises that 'seeking protection from the general risk of future disputes with a host State is not sufficient for this purpose' and that what is needed is foreseeability of 'a specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy.'376\n\nRespondent's Closing Skeleton, [9].\n\nClaimant's Closing Skeleton, [69], citing *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v El Salvador*, ICSID Case No ARB/09/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 June 2012, [CL-57] [2.99].\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal approaches the question on the basis that not much is to be gained by glossing the general test of reasonable foreseeability of a dispute. The important point is that actions taken by way of general protection from the risk of future disputes are not an abuse of process. At the same time, a test based on foreseeability must of its nature include instances in which the specific State measure has not yet been taken, such that the precise State powers or mechanisms to be used, and their effects on the investment, are not necessarily known to the investor.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the threshold for finding an abuse of process is high.377 It cannot be presumed.378 It is to be determined taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case. At the same time, as the *Levy* tribunal observed: 'the closer the acquisition of the investment is to the act giving rise to the dispute, the higher the degree of foreseeability will normally be.'379\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC* ibid.\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v Poland)* (1926) PCIJ Ser A No 7 at 30.\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy v Peru*, ICSID Case No ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015, [RL-5] [187].\n\n325.\n\nIn the context of this case, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that what must be reasonably foreseeable\u2013\u2013that is: foreseeable to a reasonable person in the position of the investor\u2013\u2013is the risk that the Republic would expropriate all or part of the business of Koza-Ipek Holding, which is the essence of the Claimant's claim in these proceedings.\n\n***b. Date of assessment***\n---------------------------\n\n326.\n\nIn view of the fact that each Party had referred in their written pleadings to a range of different dates as being potentially relevant for a determination of reasonable foreseeability, the Tribunal addressed the date of assessment specifically with counsel in closing submissions. In answer to the Tribunal's question:\n\na. *The Claimant* submits that the critical date is 7 June 2015, being 'the date of the intention to invest\u2026the date when the Claimant entered into a binding legal document to acquire the right\u2013\u2013the shares in Koza-Ipek Holding.'380 It explains that 'at that time the state of mind of the investor is essentially crystallised for purposes of determining whether it is acting in an abusive way.'381\n\nb. *The Respondent* submits that the relevant date is not 7 June 2015 'because that simply didn't amount to an investment, that was just\u2013\u2013if anything, it was an intention to invest, it was a putative investment, because the steps that needed to be undertaken to consummate that investment hadn't taken place\u2026'382 It posits October 2016, the date on which the Consideration Shares were issued, as the operative date.\n\nHearing T9/126/21\u2013127/5.\n\nHearing T9/129/19\u201321.\n\nHearing T8/58/8\u201313.\n\n327.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the date upon which reasonable foreseeability is to be tested is the date on which a claimant acquires its investment in the respondent State. In *Tidewater*, the tribunal speaks of the time of 'the transfer to it' of the relevant business.383 In *Philip Morris*, the tribunal states that 'the initiation of a treaty-based investor-State arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights\u2026*when an investor has changed its corporate structure* to gain the protection of an investment treaty at a point in time when a specific dispute was foreseeable.'384\n\n*Tidewater v Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, [RL-31] [148].\n\n*Philip Morris v Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015*,* [RL-81] [554], emphasis added.\n\n328.\n\nThe reason why this is the critical date is that, prior to that date, the Claimant does not own an investment that may qualify for treaty protection. It is only once it can establish a proprietary title to such an investment that it may potentially assert a treaty claim. This therefore is the relevant date on which to test reasonable foreseeability.\n\n329.\n\nIn light of its analysis in section B above, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the critical date upon which to make the assessment of reasonable foreseeability is 31 August 2015, being the date upon which Akin Ipek endorsed the Ipek Family's Koza-Ipek Holding share certificates in favour of the Claimant, being the earliest date on which the Claimant could be said to have acquired its investment in Koza-Ipek Holding and thus made an investment in T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimant pleads the following as the first two acts that it alleges constitute the Respondent's breaches of the BIT:\n\na. On 31 August 2015, a search warrant was issued against Akin Ipek for spurious trumped-up charges, including allegations of supporting terrorism.\n\nb. On 1 September 2015, the Turkish police raided the Koza Group headquarters as well as offices of the Koza Media Companies and Akin Ipek's home and seized documents.385\n\nRequest, [8].\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore analyses the evidence as to whether on 31 August 2015\u2013\u2013being the day on which both the Claimant acquired its investment and the first alleged BIT breach was committed\u2013\u2013the existence of the dispute was foreseeable to a reasonable person in the position of Akin Ipek, the Claimant's directing mind.\n\n**(2) The evidence**\n--------------------\n\n332.\n\nIt is convenient to divide the evidence into three periods:\n\na. December 2013 \u2013 year 2014;\n\nb. January\u20137 June 2015; and,\n\nc. 10 June\u201331 August 2015.\n\n***a. December 2013 and 2014***\n-------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThe evidence on the arbitration record as to the significance of events from December 2013 to December 2014 presents a broadly consistent picture, the factual elements of which are not in dispute between the Parties, though the implications to be drawn from those events for the present issue are of course much in dispute.\n\n334.\n\nThere are two key developments on which the Respondent places reliance:\n\na. The Respondent's actions against Turkish nationals and companies with perceived G\u00fclenist connections after the events of December 2013 (described by the Claimant as the '2013 Corruption Scandal' and by the Respondent as the '2013 Attempted Judiciary Coup') in particular in the media field; and,\n\nb. The planned international expansion of the Koza Group in 2014 and in particular the incorporation of Koza Ltd and the transfer to it of \u00a360 million on 31 March 2014.\n\n(i) Turkish Government actions against media companies\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe first development is widely documented by contemporary independent reports, notably the Report of Lord Woolf, Jowell & Garnier 'A report on the rule of law and respect for human rights in [T\u00fcrkiye] since December 2013' (July 2015).386 Under the heading 'Political interference with media companies' that Report states:\n\nKoza Ipek Holding's chairman, Akin Ipek, who is known for his support for the Hizmet movement, stated in an interview that he was sent lists with names of journalists working for his media group who were to be fired and that people from government circles had called him several times concerning columns published by his media outlets.387\n\nExpert Report of Professor Sir Jeffrey Jowell KCMG KC in the Matter of an Extradition Request from T\u00fcrkiye (RE: Mr Buyuk, Mr Celik and Mr Ipek), 22 June 2018, [C-42], Annex [III].\n\nibid, [147].\n\n336.\n\nThe Woolf Report adds under the heading 'Financial pressure on Hizmet-affiliated media companies':\n\nCritical media outlets have not only been exposed to political pressure, but also financial repercussions. Gold mining company Koza Altin A.\u015e., the owner of *Bug\u00fcn* and Kanal T\u00fcrk TV station, had its activities halted on 31 December 2013 in \u00c7ukuralan goldfield, one of the company's five major gold mines, in a move that has been seen as an example of the government's exploitation of inspections to put pressure on those with critical views.388\n\nibid, [150].\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimant's witnesses confirmed these developments in their evidence before the Tribunal:\n\na. Akin Ipek (who acknowledges his links with G\u00fclen) accepts that he was personally pressured and that President Erdo\u011fan had sought to use regulatory pressure on the Koza mining companies 'as a pressure tactic against our media reporting'.389\n\nb. Mr Yurttas says that '[o]ur relationship with the Government deteriorated irreparably after the Koza Media Group began investigating, in October 2013, reports that Turkish cabinet ministers had been bribed to participate in a money-laundering scheme'. He adds: 'We certainly paid a significant price for doing so', mentioning examples of investigations and raids on journalists.390\n\nc. Witness 1 says that, after the December 2013 Corruption Scandal: 'the Erdo\u011fan regime began to target and intimidate groups in the free media, which I understood the Koza Group to be'.391 He/She adds that, although there had been optimism that this would improve by late 2014, this did not happen. Instead 'the Turkish government had become more aggressive', bringing investigations against companies that had spoken out against the regime.392 For this reason, he/she wished to be cautious in his/her dealings with Mr Ipek in order to protect himself/herself and his/her firm.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Hamdi Akin Ipek, [13]\u2014[18].\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr Ayhan Yurttas, [16]\u2014[17].\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Witness 1, [12].\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Witness 1, [14].\n\n(ii) Incorporation of Koza Ltd\u2013\u2013Koza's international mining expansion\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe second development on which the Respondent places reliance in this period is the incorporation of Koza Ltd in March 2014 and the transfer of \u00a360 million in capital to it. The Respondent alleges that the purpose of this was to remove assets from T\u00fcrkiye.393 The Claimant maintains that it was part of a planned internationalization of the Koza Group's mining business.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slide, [36].\n\n339.\n\nThe Respondent relies on a witness statement of Akin Ipek in previous English proceedings.394 Mr Ipek there states: 'As the Turkish government's campaign against the Koza Group gathered pace, I took steps to ensure that it would not be able to confiscate Koza Ltd's capital.'395 However, read in context, this statement does not relate to the initial transfer to Koza Ltd in March 2014. Mr Ipek had already deposed that Koza Altin's capital had been initially paid into an account at BBVA London.396 He then refers to the transfer of those funds to a Luxembourg account; the decision to transfer the funds back to London on 30 October 2015;397 and the subsequent difficulties encountered in returning the funds to London. His statement about confiscation relates to this post-October 2015 period.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slide, [37], citing Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Ak\u0131n \u0130pek in Case No HC-2016-002407, *Koza Ltd v Ak\u00e7il*, 16 August 2016, [R-14].\n\nWitness Statement of Hamdi Ak\u0131n \u0130pek in Case No HC-2016-002407, Koza Ltd v Ak\u00e7il, 16 August 2016, [R-14], [74].\n\nibid, [55].\n\nibid, [56]\u2014[57].\n\n340.\n\nThe Claimant's witness evidence on this issue was given by Akin Ipek and Tekin Ipek:\n\na. Akin Ipek describes the deteriorating mining climate in T\u00fcrkiye as related to regulatory matters preceding and unrelated to the events of December 2013, leading to a decision to expand internationally through a UK subsidiary, Koza Ltd, with an initial capital of \u00a360 million.398\n\nb. Tekin Ipek gave detailed oral evidence on the reasons to 'carry our mining business abroad'; the decision to incorporate in London; and to transfer \u00a360 million in capital.399 These decisions were a matter of public record at the time.400 Tekin Ipek followed incorporation of the company with correspondence and meetings with the British Consul General in Istanbul between June\u2013October 2014.401\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [20]\u2014[25].\n\nHearing T4/64/19\u201368/25; Hearing T4/105/13\u2013106/12.\n\nKoza Limited Incorporation Documents, 24 March 2014, [HAI-37]; Koza Altin, Board of Directors Resolution, Meeting No 2014/14, 31 March 2014, [R-44].\n\nEmails between UK Trade & Investment Department and Foreign Commonwealth Office and Koza Gold re meetings with Tekin Ipek, 13 June 2014 to 28 October 2018, [HAI-63]; Hearing T4/105/12\u2013106/12.\n\n341.\n\nThe Turkish pool media speculated at the time that this might be a prelude to Koza Altin fleeing the country, following the 31 March 2014 victory of Mr Erdo\u011fan's party AKP in local elections and, subsequently, the election of Mr Erdo\u011fan as President.402\n\n\"The Great Escape\", Turkish Daily Newspaper, *Takvim*, 2 April 2014, [R-45]; \"Does Koza Altin Flee From This Country?\", Turkish Daily Newspaper, Sabah, 2 April 2014, [R-46]; \"Moving to London\", Turkish Daily Newspaper Takvim, 2 April 2014, [R-47].\n\n342.\n\nIn light of these press articles, on 2 June 2014, the Turkish President requested MASAK to prepare a preliminary report on whether the monies raised from the mines could be transferred abroad.403 The preliminary report from a MASAK finance specialist, Mr Akdag, dated 4 August 2014, identified a number of matters warranting further investigation.404\n\nAugust 2014 MASAK Report, [R-48], [1]; First Witness Statement of Mr Alpaslan Kumas, [14].\n\nAugust 2014 MASAK Report, [R-48].\n\n343.\n\nUltimately MASAK addressed the incorporation of Koza Ltd as part of its larger investigation, in light of enquiries made in both T\u00fcrkiye and the UK and of applicable legislation in both countries. MASAK reported its conclusions on 26 September 2016.405 It noted that:\n\nDocuments attached to the letter provided by Koza Altin on 13 August 2015 reveal that even though Koza Altin had been planning to internationalise the company for a long time, Koza Ltd was incorporated in the UK on 31 March 2014. Koza Altin submitted to the Public Disclosure Platform (\"PDP\") to this Inspection Office regarding this matter\u2026406\n\nMASAK Memo No 10: Letter No 71198378-663.05.[2015-19]-10 with the findings regarding the acquisition of Koza Alt\u0131n \u0130\u015fletmeleri A.\u015e., acquisition of Kanalt\u00fcrk TV, incorporation of Koza Ltd in the UK, matters regarding the Capital Market Law contained in the Analyses Report, and the effects of tax evasion lawsuit filed against Hamdi Ak\u0131n \u0130pek and insider trading lawsuit filed against Cafer Tekin \u0130pek on money laundering, 26 September 2016, [R-318] (accepted by Mr Kumas of MASAK in cross-examination, Hearing T2/112/5\u2013113/21).\n\nibid, p [4].\n\n344.\n\nMASAK found that the company had been properly incorporated in the UK in accordance with applicable UK law. The transfer of \u00a360 million had been made in accordance with Turkish Decree No 32, which permitted free transfer of capital for the purpose of establishing companies abroad 'to make investments or to carry out commercial activities abroad.' Accordingly, it concluded: 'the transaction is an investment made in the UK and carried out in accordance with the applicable legislation.'407\n\nidem.\n\n345.\n\n*Tribunal's assessment.* The Tribunal's conclusion on the significance of the evidence concerning events to end 2014 is that the Koza Group had experienced deteriorating conditions for its businesses in T\u00fcrkiye during the course of 2014, in particular as a result of the actions taken by the Respondent against the free media in T\u00fcrkiye, which undoubtedly had led to tension between the Ipek Family and the Respondent by year end. Partly as a result, and partly in order to seek to diversify its mining business outside T\u00fcrkiye, Koza had established a UK subsidiary, Koza Ltd, in March 2014.\n\n346.\n\nThe latter action may be interpreted as a prudent step to protect part of the Koza business from the general risk of future disputes with the Respondent, but this does not make the dispute that is the subject matter of these proceedings\u2013\u2013namely the confiscation of the assets of the Koza Group\u2013\u2013reasonably foreseeable:\n\na. Koza continued to operate in T\u00fcrkiye in both its media and mining businesses throughout 2014;\n\nb. Although the Respondent reacted to pool media reports concerning the establishment of Koza Ltd and the transfer of \u00a360 million, its own investigation agency, MASAK, found this transaction to be fully compliant with the law;\n\nc. Although the Respondent took a number of steps against individuals and companies that it regarded as associated with the G\u00fclenist movement in the course of 2014, these did not involve the confiscation of assets.\n\nd. The Respondent's submission that the transfer of \u00a360 million was made in order to place these funds out of reach of confiscation by the Turkish authorities is not supported by convincing evidence. The MASAK investigation, which was conducted and reported in 2016 confirms the lawfulness of the \u00a360 million transfer according to Turkish law.\n\n***b. January\u2013June 2015***\n--------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe position up to and including the execution of the SPA on 7 June 2015 may be conveniently considered in three sub-sections: (i) developments January\u2013April 2015; (ii) May 2015; and (iii) the preparation of the SPA of 7 June 2015.\n\n(i) Developments January\u2013April 2015\n-----------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nIn the first four months, there are two developments of note. The Parties differ in their characterisation of the significance of these developments:\n\na. The management of Bank Asya is transferred to TMSF in February 2015.\n\nb. The efforts, led by Tekin Ipek, to consolidate Koza's position in London.\n\n349.\n\n*Bank Asya*. The Respondent relies on the predictions of a Turkish pool media journalist, Cem Kucuk, beginning in late November 2014, that the assets of both the 'parallel bank and the parallel media' would be confiscated by the TMSF408 as indicating that, once the assets of Bank Asya had been confiscated, it was foreseeable that the assets of the Koza media group would be as well.409\n\n@cemkucuk55 tweet, 25 November 2014, [R-289]; \"Pennsylvania will end up with in Silivri!\", *Yeni \u015eafak*, 16 December 2014, [R-290]; \"How the parallel media will be expropriated?\", *Star*, 2 May 2015, [R-292].\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, [40].\n\n350.\n\nThese articles were put to Mr Yurttas, former President of the Koza media companies, in cross-examination.410 His evidence is that he had not read these articles and tweets before and that 'I do not think that anyone takes him seriously.'411\n\nHearing T6/26/7\u201332/20.\n\nHearing T6/32/3\u20134.\n\n351.\n\nSo far as concerns the transfer of Bank Asya, Reuters did report on 4 February 2015 that the Government's motive may be 'political'.412 However, the same article goes on to note that: 'Shares in other companies linked to Gulen's followers fell initially after the regulator's move, but then rebounded. Gold miner Koza Altin rose 0.3 percent\u2026.'413\n\n\"UPDATE 5-T\u00fcrkiye takes over management control of Bank Asya\", Reuters, 4 April 2015, [R-261].\n\nIdem.\n\n352.\n\n*Koza business in London*. In the same period, the Claimant relies on evidence concerning the efforts of the Koza Group and the Ipek Family to consolidate their position in London: Tekin Ipek's meeting with the British Consul-General in Istanbul on 4 March 2015;414 his business trips to London in November 2014 and again from 21-23 March 2015;415 and the purchase by Koza Altin and Koza Ltd of two flats in London, completed on 17 April 2015.416\n\nEmail from Esra Anul to Yasemin Baser and Zeynep Oztekbas entitled \"RE: Meeting with Mr Tekin Ipek\", 27 February 2015, [C-216].\n\nEmail from Z. Oztekbas to T Ipek and attachment, 1 March 2015, [HAI-45].\n\nLand Registry Extracts for Flats 40 and 50 Drake House, London, 22 December 2015, [HAI-53].\n\n353.\n\nTekin Ipek gave detailed testimony about this at the hearing.417 He explains the reasons for this decision in the following terms:\n\nMy brother is usually very diligent in the way he researches these things, and in those years \u2013 and he and I, we decided we should make London our base to grow the business internationally, because we thought that these obstacles that we were coming up against in the mining sector could be the case in other sectors, so when my brother asked me whether we should move the business to London, I agreed with him, because at the time, and as you can see in the documents, there were unfortunately some events taking place about our family\u2026.there was absurd news circulating about our family, and my brother was also very worried about this, and I just want to remind you of some of these press articles. There were suggestions that we were taking ten billion, seven billion dollars outside\u2026and this had nothing to do with the truth\u2026So instead of dealing with these false news, we wanted to move abroad and do our business, and in was a responsibility on our part: we wanted to grow the company and so it was a necessity for us to relocate to London.418\n\nHearing T4/64/21\u201367/3; Hearing T4/72/5\u201373/17; Hearing T4/105/12\u2013106/12 (questions from Arbitrator L\u00e9vy); Hearing T4/138/16\u2013141/12 (questions from the President).\n\nHearing T4/72/10\u201373/17.\n\n354.\n\n*Tribunal's assessment.* The Tribunal's assessment of the evidence in this period is that there was increasing risk in T\u00fcrkiye for businesses that the Government perceived to be linked to G\u00fclen. One of the Ipek brothers' key motivations for planning a move to London was concern to mitigate this risk. But the evidence up to this point does not on its own justify the conclusion that the expropriation of the business of Koza-Ipek Holding was reasonably foreseeable.\n\n(ii) May 2015\n-------------\n\n355.\n\nThere are two material sets of events in May 2015:\n\na. The commencement of the MASAK investigation into the Koza Group; and,\n\nb. The incorporation of the Claimant and the proposed 10% SPA.\n\n356.\n\n*MASAK Investigation*. On 18 May 2015, Koza Altin received a letter from MASAK requesting the production of documents in the context of an investigation under Law No 5549.419\n\nLetter from MASAK to Koza Altin entitled \"Information Request\", 13 May 2015, [R-49].\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this letter put the Koza Group on notice of a dispute with the Government. It says that Law No 5549 covers the financing of terrorism as well as money laundering and that one of the powers conferred upon the court in a prosecution under the Law is the confiscation of assets. It refers to the fact that, prior to commencement of the investigation, a further article from Cem Kucuk in the pool media speculated that the assets of Bug\u00fcn TV and newspaper could be seized under the terrorism financing legislation, with MASAK being the main authority in this field. The article was circulated amongst Koza staff.\n\n358.\n\nBoth Mr Yurttas (the Claimant's witness) and Mr Kumas (the Respondent's witness) confirmed at the hearing that MASAK's mandate extends to the financing of terrorism as well as money laundering. The MASAK letter was put to Akin Ipek at the hearing. He denied that this letter made it clear to him that his assets would be seized.\n\n359.\n\nMASAK did not inform Koza Altin of the focus of its enquiry in May 2015. However, Mr Kumas accepted under cross-examination, and it is apparent from the MASAK 12 reports on the arbitration file which were written between March\u2013September 2016, that the initial focus of the enquiry was into money laundering and included a number of the allegations that had earlier been made in the pool media. MASAK found no evidence of money-laundering as a result of its investigation in the period March\u201330 June 2016. It was only after Decree Laws Nos 667 and 668 had been promulgated in July 2016 (following the attempted coup), in which various Koza Group entities or related foundations were listed as affiliated to a terrorist group, that MASAK in turn concluded that there was a case to be referred to the public prosecutor that Koza had financed terrorism.\n\n360.\n\n*Tribunal's assessment.* Notification of the commencement of the MASAK investigation, together with the prior press reports that were circulated within the Koza Group, would, in the Tribunal's view, have undoubtedly contributed to a higher sense that the assets of the Koza Group were at risk at the hands of the Republic. Yet, given that the initial focus of the enquiry, up to and including July 2016, was limited to allegations of money laundering that MASAK itself found to be groundless, the development does not on its own make it reasonably foreseeable that the assets of the Koza Group would be seized or other actions constituting a breach of the BIT would be taken. However, it would have accelerated the desire of the Ipek Family to take steps outside T\u00fcrkiye to protect their business.\n\n361.\n\n*Incorporation of the Claimant.* This is indeed what happened. Tekin Ipek made a business trip to London on 8 May 2015 and met Morgan Lewis, the London law firm.420 Akin Ipek was staying at the Park Tower Hotel Knightsbridge from 14 May\u201312 June 2015421 and met Morgan Lewis on 19 May.422\n\nEmail from Morgan Lewis to Latham & Watkins entitled \"Ipek - Strictly Private & Confidential\", 23 December 2019, [C-266].\n\nPark Tower Hotel Information Invoice No 464335, 16 January 2017, [HAI-103].\n\nEmail from Morgan Lewis to Latham & Watkins entitled \"Ipek - Strictly Private & Confidential\", 23 December 2019, [C-266].\n\n362.\n\nOut of these initial meetings, Morgan Lewis developed its proposal for a transaction whereby the Ipek Family would transfer 10% of their shareholding in Koza-Ipek Holding to a newly incorporated British company: the Claimant in these proceedings (**the Proposed 10% SPA**).\n\n363.\n\nIn pursuance of this plan, the Claimant was incorporated on 26 May 2015.423 Its Memorandum of Association lists each of the Ipek Family members, with shares in the Claimant in proportion to their respective shareholdings in Koza-Ipek Holding. The Memorandum was signed by each family member individually and presented to Companies House by Morgan Lewis.424\n\nIIL Certificate of Incorporation, 26 May 2015, [RfA-33].\n\nIIL Memorandum of Association, 26 May 2015, [HAI-48].\n\n364.\n\nThe proposal is summarised in a draft presentation document (the **Proposal Document**) dated 20 May 2015.425 Successive drafts of the SPA itself are dated 27 May,426 28 May,427 and 2 June 2015.428 Integral to this proposal is the Shareholders' Agreement (**SHA**), a draft of which is dated 1 June 2015.429\n\nEmail from Mehmet Ali Erdogan to Okan Bayrak entitled \"IPEK Investment Limited \u2013 Presentation.PPTX\" with attachment, 23 May 2015, [R-50].\n\nDraft Share Purchase Agreement, 27 May 2015 Draft, 27 May 2015, [C-222].\n\nDraft Share Purchase Agreement, 28 May 2015 Draft, 28 May 2015, [C-223].\n\nDraft Share Purchase Agreement, 2 June 2015 Draft, 2 June 2015, [C-224].\n\nEmail from Mehmet Ali Erdogan to \u0130smail Bi\u00e7er entitled \"IPEK shareholder agreement \u2013 KOZA IPEK HOLDINGS A.S.\" with attachment, 1 June 2015, [R-53].\n\n365.\n\n*The Proposed 10% SPA*. The key features of this proposed transaction are as follows:\n\na. The parties to the transaction are the individual members of the Ipek Family identified as the 'Sellers' and Ipek Investment Ltd as the 'Purchaser'.\n\nb. The transaction provides for the transfer of a proportion of the Ipek Family's shares in Koza-Ipek Holding (the 'Shares') to Ipek Investment Ltd, with Ipek Investment Ltd issuing shares in itself to the Ipek Family as consideration (the 'Consideration Shares') (cls 1.1, 2, and 3).\n\nc. The Sellers' obligation on closing is to execute agreements, transfers, conveyances or other documents that may be required under local law to implement the transfer of the Shares to the Purchaser, with title stated to be transferred through the local documents rather than by the SPA itself (cl 4.2).\n\nd. The Purchaser's obligation, also on closing, is the issuance of Consideration Shares, and delivery of executed share certificates to the Sellers (cl 4.3).\n\ne. The SPA, including non-contractual disputes or claims arising out of it, are to be governed by and construed in accordance with English law, with the parties irrevocably agreeing that the courts of England have jurisdiction to settle any disputes arising out of or in connection with the SPA (cl 6.10).\n\nf. Although the relevant schedules listing the exact number of Shares and Consideration Shares issued by, and to, each member of the Ipek Family were not completed in any draft, the cover page for each iteration shows the transaction envisioned the transfer of 10% of Koza-Ipek Holding's shareholding to the Purchaser, as well as the 'Relevant Proportion' column of the Schedule in the second and third drafts.\n\n366.\n\nAlterations are made with each iteration across the successive 10% Drafts. Notably:\n\na. The addition of a new clause clarifying that the closing obligations are triggered only where the Ipek Family sells the Koza-Ipek Holding shares (and Ipek Investment Ltd purchases them) simultaneously: 'The Purchaser shall not be obliged to purchase any of the Shares, and no Seller shall be obliged to sell his Shares, unless the sale and purchase of all of the Shares is completed simultaneously' (cl 2.2.3).\n\nb. Clause 4.1 is tentatively amended: the provision that closing shall take place at such place as agreed between the parties to the transaction includes, in square brackets, closing at such place 'outside the United Kingdom', with a footnote explaining 'Note potential UK stamp duty risk if Closing occurs in the UK'.\n\nc. The Sellers' obligation on closing is extended: as well as delivery to the Purchaser of the local transfer documents, the Sellers must also deliver to the Purchaser the share certificates in respect of the Shares in Koza-Ipek Holding sold to the Purchaser (cl 4.2.1).\n\n367.\n\nThe 10% Drafts also contain a series of provisions that Morgan Lewis notes would need to be reviewed by local (i.e., Turkish) counsel, relating to the transfer of the Koza-Ipek Holding shares from the Sellers to the Purchaser:\n\na. The definition of 'encumbrance' in cl 1.1. Clause 2.2.1 specifies the Sellers shall sell the Shares to the Purchaser free from any encumbrances.\n\nb. The definition of 'Relevant Proportion' in cl 1.1 and cl 5.1.3, where each Seller warrants to the Purchaser that each Seller's Shares comprise the Relevant Proportion of the 'issued and allotted share capital of the Company, have been properly and validly issued and allotted and each are fully paid or credited as fully paid'.\n\nc. The statement in cl 2.2.2 that the Sellers shall procure, on or prior to Closing, that any or all rights of pre-emption over the Shares are waived irrevocably by anyone entitled to such a right. Morgan Lewis notes 'we assume pre-emption rights will not apply here, however to be confirmed by local counsel'.\n\nd. The Sellers' closing obligations to deliver the local transfer documents and share certificates (cl 4.2.1), and the clause stating the provisions of the SPA shall prevail to the extent a local transfer document is inconsistent with the SPA, and that in the case of such inconsistency the parties shall procure that the provisions of the local transfer document be adjusted to give effect to the SPA (cl 4.2.2).\n\n368.\n\n*The Shareholder Agreement*. The 10% Drafts should be read in conjunction with the draft SHA, prepared by Morgan Lewis alongside the 10% Drafts. The Proposal Document, outlining the Proposed 10% SPA arrangement, notes that a key step is a 'Shareholder Agreement entered into between Ipek Investment Limited, Ipek Holdings A.S. and the Ipek Family entrenching Ipek Investment Limited's rights.'430\n\nEmail from Mehmet Ali Erdogan to Okan Bayrak entitled \"IPEK Investment Limited \u2013 Presentation.PPTX\" with attachment, 23 May 2015, [R-50], attachment sl [4].\n\n369.\n\nIn his testimony before the Tribunal, Akin Ipek stated the SHA was an integral part of this proposed transaction: 'it wasn't just the 10%, by the way; there was also a shareholders' agreement which was involved in that deal, which also foresaw the movement of the headquarters to London.'431 Mr Selman Turk states that, when he viewed and discussed one of the 10% Drafts with Mr Akin Ipek in late May or early June 2015, he was also shown a draft SHA that was bundled with the 10% Draft as a single file.432\n\nHearing T3/108/25\u2013109/3.\n\nHearing T6/115/19\u2013116/1.\n\n370.\n\nUnlike the 10% Drafts, the arbitration record contains only one version of the draft SHA. The draft is dated 1 June 2015 and is attached to an email of the same date from Mehmet Ali Erdogan of Regnum Solicitors to Ismail Bicer of the Baycan Law Firm, where it is described as a 'first version' of the SHA with finalisation to take place in the following days after detailed discussion of the draft.\n\n371.\n\nThe key features of the SHA are that:\n\na. It was to be made on the same date as the SPA was entered into (cl 1.1 definition of 'Acquisition Agreement'), and at the venue of the SPA's completion (cl 3.1). It is a tripartite agreement between Koza-Ipek Holding, Ipek Investment Ltd, and Koza-Ipek Holding shareholders.\n\nb. The SHA, by cl 7.1, would give Ipek Investment Ltd the power to appoint up to two non-executive Directors to the Board of Koza-Ipek Holding and the board of any Koza Group companies. By cl 7.3, the first of these Investor Directors (i.e., directors appointed in accordance with cl 7.1) were to be Akin Ipek and Tekin Ipek. By direction of either an Investor Director or Ipek Investment Ltd, the Claimant would be able to appoint and remove a person to the Koza-Ipek Holding Board to act as Chairman (cl 8).\n\nc. By cl 4.1 of the SHA, Koza-Ipek Holding would undertake to Ipek Investment Ltd to comply with a series of positive (sch 3 pt 1) and negative (sch 3 pt 2) undertakings relating to the conduct of the business.\n\nd. The positive undertakings include that Koza-Ipek Holding shall, and procure that each Koza Group company will: Procure that the expansion, development, or evolution of the business 'is effected only through [Koza-Ipek Holding] and its wholly-owned subsidiaries' (sch 3 cl 1.1), and comply with any direction given from time to time by either an Investor Director or Ipek Investment Ltd (sch 3 cl 1.7(c)).\n\ne. The negative undertakings are that Koza-Ipek Holding will not (and shall procure that no Koza Group company will), in the absence of written consent by either Ipek Investment Ltd or an Investor Director: make changes to the company's accounting policies, business plans, or annual budgets (sch 3 cl 2.1); incur indebtedness beyond determined parameters (sch 3 cl 2.2); acquire or dispose of capital commitments other than in the ordinary course of business (sch 3 cl 2.3); enter into, vary, or terminate various agreements or arrangements (sch 3 cl 2.4); acquire or dispose of freehold or leasehold property (sch 3 cl 2.5); allot or issue shares or securities in any Koza Group company (sch 3 cl 2.7(a)).\n\nf. As in the 10% Drafts, the SHA is governed by English law and disputes arising out of or in connection with the SHA are submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales (cl 22).\n\n372.\n\nMorgan Lewis also advised in the Proposal Document as to the UK tax consequences of the proposed transaction, noting *inter alia* that:\n\n\u2013 No UK capital gains tax payable provided none of the shareholders are currently UK ta[x]payers\n\n\u2013 No UK stamp duty payable provided SPA executed outside UK\n\n...\n\n\u2013 Dividends paid by IPEK Investments Limited will be taxable in the UK if shareholders UK resident (whether or not UK domiciled)\n\n\u2013 UK inheritance tax of 40% of value of shares payable in the event of death of a shareholder.433\n\nEmail from Mehmet Ali Erdogan to Okan Bayrak entitled \"IPEK Investment Limited \u2013 Presentation.PPTX\" with attachment, 23 May 2015, [R-50] sl [3], [5].\n\n373.\n\nIn view of the latter consideration, they proposed a future transfer of shares to an offshore Jersey trust so as to avoid inheritance tax.\n\n374.\n\nThe Proposal Document had also emphasised that: 'Consideration would need to be given to Turkish law and tax consequences of transfer'.434 According to Akin Ipek, he had retained Mehmet Ali Erdogan (**Mehmet Ali**) of Regnum Solicitors in London to advise on the Turkish law aspects.435\n\nibid, sl [3].\n\nFourth Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [22]\u2014[28].\n\n375.\n\nMehmet Ali sent the proposal document to Okan Bayrak, Investment Department Manager of Koza Gold on 25 May 2015 under cover of an email stating: 'Structure is attached; it is down to you to obtain the requisite opinions from [T\u00fcrkiye]with regard to regulatory and tax aspects of potential share transfer in [T\u00fcrkiye]. Let's discuss later.'436\n\nEmail from Mehmet Ali Erdogan to Okan Bayrak entitled \"IPEK Investment Limited \u2013 Presentation.PPTX\" with attachment, 23 May 2015, [R-50], p [1].\n\n376.\n\nHe then sent the draft 10% SPA to Ismail Bicer, a partner of Baycan Law Firm in T\u00fcrkiye on 28 May 2015 under cover of instructions that Mr Bicer prepare a power of attorney for Akin Ipek to authorise the applications before the trade registry and other authorities.437\n\nEmail from Mehmet Ali Erdogan to \u0130smail Bi\u00e7er entitled \"IPEK INVESTMENT LTD Share Purchase Agreement\" with attachment, 28 May 2015, [R-51] (and see Mr Bicer's confirmation to King & Spalding: Email exchange between Ismail Bicer and King & Spalding entitled \"HC\u20102016\u2010002407 \u2010 Koza Limited and Hamdi Akin Ipek v Mustafa Ak\u00e7il et al \u2010 Preservation of Documents\", 5 February 2019 to 8 February 2019, [R-101]).\n\n377.\n\nMr Bicer replied on an interim basis to Mehmet Ali on 29 May 2015, stating:\n\nWe are still evaluating the \"Proposed Transaction\" stated in draft presentation prepared by Morgan Lewis and its effects as to the Turkish Commercial Code, the Capital Market Law and relevant communiqu\u00e9s, the Competition Law and Direct Foreign Investments Law\u2026.\n\n\u2026a deed of transfer and endorsement and delivery of such shares and interim certificates, as well as registration of share ledger upon approval of the Board of Directors should be realized for transfer.438\n\nEmail exchange between Mehmet Ali Erdogan and \u0130smail Bi\u00e7er entitled \"IPEK INVESTMENT LTD Share Purchase Agreement\" with attachment, 28 May 2015 to 1 June 2015, [R-52].\n\n378.\n\nMr Bicer proposed to prepare a memo on compliance with Turkish law by 4 June 2015.439 He identified the need to obtain separate tax advice from Turkish tax advisor.\n\nibid, [11].\n\n379.\n\nMehmet Ali then sent him the first draft of the SHA on 1 June 2015 stating 'tomorrow we can go through this draft and discuss in detail. Finalisation of the draft agreement would take few days.'440\n\nEmail from Mehmet Ali Erdogan to \u0130smail Bi\u00e7er entitled \"IPEK shareholder agreement \u2013 KOZA IPEK HOLDINGS A.S.\" with attachment, 1 June 2015, [R-53], p [2].\n\n380.\n\nMr Bicer delivered his legal opinion to (amongst others) Mehmet Ali and Mr Erdem (Secretary General of the Koza Altin Board) on 5 June 2015. His opinion included the advice that (a) Subject to the interpretation of the Capital Markets Board, there may be an obligation to make a tender offer; (b) 'the prior approval of the Board of Directors is required to be obtained in order to be able to transfer 10% privileged shares of the company to [the Claimant]'; and (c) an Information Form about the transaction would have to be delivered to the Directorate General of Incentive Implementation and Foreign Investment within one month.441\n\nEmail from \u0130smail Bi\u00e7er to Okan Bayrak entitled \"Revised \u2013 Additional Info Notes\" with attachments, 10 June 2015, [R-56].\n\n381.\n\nThis is the last communication on file in respect to the Proposed 10% SPA. It will be necessary to return to Akin Ipek's explanation of his decision to dismiss Mehmet Ali and to reconfigure the transaction into a 100% SPA in the next section.\n\n382.\n\nFor present purposes, the following five key aspects of the Proposed 10% SPA should be noted:\n\na. The Proposed 10% SPA contemplated a closing in which all necessary steps to complete the transaction would take place simultaneously.\n\nb. The transaction, if completed, would have enabled the Claimant, through its directors (Akin Ipek and Tekin Ipek) to control the key decisions to be made at the Board of Koza-Ipek Holding pursuant to the provisions of the SHA.\n\nc. Nevertheless, only 10% of the shares would be owned by the Claimant, a British company. The remaining 90% of the shares would have remained owned by the Ipek Family members, all Turkish nationals.\n\nd. The Turkish legal advisors (Regnum and Baycan) contemplated that approvals would be required in T\u00fcrkiye and that the transfer would have to be registered in T\u00fcrkiye.\n\ne. The transaction presented significant potential UK tax disadvantages, especially if (i) the Ipek Family or some of them proposed to take up residence in England; and (ii) the transaction was executed in the UK.\n\n383.\n\nAkin Ipek was asked about this last point. His evidence is that he did not plan to pay dividends from the Claimant as 'we usually withdraw as much money as necessary\u2026[w]e put the dividends back into the companies'.442 He added that he was later told orally by Tom Cartwright of Morgan Lewis that 'when a Turkish company is transferred in the UK there would be no stamp duty'.443\n\nHearing T4/162/16-19.\n\nHearing T4/161/15-22.\n\n384.\n\n*Tribunal's assessment.* Taking these points together, it would have been apparent to any reasonable person in the position of Akin Ipek that the proposed 10% transaction would not present any real commercial advantages, nor would it mitigate regulatory risk in T\u00fcrkiye, since it would have had to be notified to the Turkish authorities. Moreover, it might carry with it some real tax disadvantages under UK law, which at the least called for further formal tax advice. It would not protect the Ipek Family against a possible future dispute with the Republic, since 90% of the shareholding would remain with the Ipek Family members, *i.e.*, Turkish nationals.\n\n(iii) Preparation of the SPA of 7 June 2015\n-------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nIt is at this point that the differences between the proposed 10% SPA and the 100% SPA of 7 June 2015, and the explanations for them, become of critical importance.\n\n386.\n\nThe 10% Drafts and the SPA dated on its face 7 June 2015 set out substantively different transactions.\n\n387.\n\nIn addition to the fact that the whole shareholding is now to be transferred, the main differences between the 10% transaction and the SPA dated 7 June 2015 include:\n\na. The SPA itself is a tripartite agreement between the members of the Ipek Family, Koza-Ipek Holding, and the Claimant, whereas the 10% Drafts only had the Ipek Family and the Claimant as parties (with Koza-Ipek Holding as party only to the SHA).\n\nb. The Closing, which across the 10% Drafts would take place at such place as may be agreed between the Parties, now takes place as such place as the Sellers may determine unilaterally (cl 4.1).\n\nc. The language of the recitals and the Sellers' obligations on closing (cl 4.2.1) now refer specifically to Akin Ipek acting with authority on behalf of the other Sellers.\n\nd. The Sellers' obligations, rather than referring generally to the execution of local transfer documents which then transfer title in the shares to the Purchaser, now consist of the endorsement of share certificates to Purchaser, with such endorsement stated to transfer title (cl 4.2.1). Failure of any Seller to sign and endorse the share certificates is stated to not affect the post-closing obligations of the Claimant and Koza-Ipek Holding (cl 4.2.2).\n\ne. The obligations on the Claimant to issue Consideration Shares, previously an obligation on closing, is now a post-closing obligation which the Claimant must fulfil within three working days of written notification from the Sellers given at any time after closing (cl 5.1). If the Claimant fails to fulfil this obligation, the Ipek Family have the right to ask for compensation in the form of fair market value of the shares (cl 6.2.1).\n\nf. Koza-Ipek Holding, now a party to the SPA, is under a post-closing obligation to approve the share transfer by Board resolution, register the Claimant as the new owner of the shares in the register, and convene a general assembly of the company in which its Board shall resign to be replaced by the Claimant's appointees. This obligation must also be fulfilled within three working days of written notification, given by the Claimant at any time after the issuance and delivery of the Consideration Shares to the Ipek Family by the Claimant (cl 5.2). If Koza-Ipek Holding fails to meet this obligation, the Claimant has the right to ask for compensation in the form of the fair market value of the shares (cl 6.2.2).\n\ng. Two additional warranties are added: each member of the Ipek Family involved in the transaction warrants to the Claimant as to the validity of the share certificates (cl 7.1.4); and Koza-Ipek Holding warrants to the Claimant that it has the legal right and power to enter into the SPA (cl 7.3).\n\nh. While not present in any of the 10% Draft exhibits, the Morgan Lewis logo and contact information appears on the cover page of the 7 June 2015 SPA.\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal received direct evidence from both Akin Ipek and Witness 1 as to the reasons for and process by which the 10% SPA was amended in the first week of June 2015 to form the 100% SPA.444\n\nFourth Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [28]\u2014[31]; Hearing T3/95\u2013106; Second Witness Statement of Witness 1, [7]\u2014[23]; Hearing T5/54\u201390.\n\n389.\n\nIn summary, Mr Ipek maintains that he had sacked Mehmet Ali, because, contrary to his instructions, he had divulged details of the transactions to Koza staff in T\u00fcrkiye and to Baycan, external lawyers to the Koza Group in T\u00fcrkiye. He said:\n\nIt was very frustrating for me that these people had become involved in the transaction since we had tried to keep the transaction confidential to avoid another campaign of black propaganda by the Turkish \"pool media\" about us supposedly running away from [T\u00fcrkiye]\u2026.445\n\nFourth Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [28].\n\n390.\n\nInstead, he instructed Witness 1, a Turkish lawyer 'who was in [T\u00fcrkiye] to discuss the SPA and the transaction'.446\n\nibid, [29].\n\n391.\n\nMr Ipek says that he had always intended to transfer 100% of the shareholding to the Claimant, transferring 10% first and the remaining 90% within a few months. He had initially thought that the pool media 'would be less likely to report it and vilify us' if they learned of a 10% transaction.447\n\nibid, [23].\n\n392.\n\nWitness 1 deposes that it was on his/her advice that the transaction was amended to a 100% transaction (omitting the SHA) and that he/she made the necessary changes in 'a couple of hours'.448 He/She maintains that 'my amendments did not alter the basic obligations contained in the agreement'.449 He/She maintains that he/she added cl 6 'to protect the purchaser in the event that the company, which is often controlled by the seller, does not perform its post-closing obligations'.450 He/She says that he/she did not want his/her name on the document because, in view of 'the tension between the Ipek Family, Ipek Media Group and the government\u2026I didn't want to appear as the lawyer who designed this'.451\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Witness 1, [10].\n\nidem.\n\nibid, [18].\n\nHearing T5/100/5\u20138.\n\n393.\n\n*Tribunal's assessment.* The Tribunal has a number of serious reservations about the process by which the SPA was apparently concluded on 7 June 2015 and the form that it took.\n\n394.\n\nMr Ipek's concerns about the manner in which Mehmet Ali had sought advice within the Koza Group are quite understandable. These concerns do not explain why he did not continue to consult Morgan Lewis about the transaction. They had raised significant issues about the UK tax consequences of even a 10% transfer of the shareholding and had also recommended that Turkish legal and tax advice be taken, yet no further written advice was taken and no explanation is offered for Mr Ipek's decision not to proceed further with Morgan Lewis at that stage.\n\n395.\n\nThe SPA was executed entirely by Mr Ipek on behalf of the Ipek Family, the Claimant and Koza-Ipek Holding, in contrast to the Claimant's Memorandum, which each member of the Ipek Family had signed personally.\n\n396.\n\nThe Turkish lawyers (both Baycan and Witness 1) had advised that approvals and public disclosure would be required for the transaction in T\u00fcrkiye. Clause 5.2 itself required after Closing a Board resolution to approve the transfer and registration on the share ledger. Yet the SPA deferred the Closing itself to 31 August 2015 and converted both registration of the shares and the issue of the Consideration Shares into post-completion obligations. If Mr Ipek did intend to complete the transaction, it seems beyond doubt that various approvals and disclosure in T\u00fcrkiye would be required. The adverse reaction (and potential for governmental intervention) that concerned him could be deferred but not avoided. The SPA as executed merely left all of these questions for another day.\n\n397.\n\nClause 6.2.2 imposed upon Koza-Ipek Holding an obligation to compensate the Ipek Family for the fair market value of the shares in the event that the post-completion actions were not taken. Witness 1 deposes that he/she included this 'common clause' in order to protect the purchaser, since the company 'is often controlled by the seller'. This explanation makes no commercial sense in the context of the transfer of the ownership structure within a family group that own and will continue to own 100% of the company, albeit now through their shares in the Claimant. However, it makes complete sense if the true purpose of the SPA was to protect the Ipek Family interest in the event that Koza-Ipek Holding were expropriated. It would give rise to the very cause of action that the Claimant now asserts based on a legal claim to \"performance under [a] contract\" under Art 1(a)(iii) of the BIT.452\n\nRejoinder, [296]; Claimant's Closing Skeleton, [4].\n\n398.\n\nThese features of the SPA and the circumstances of its conclusion strongly suggest that the true purpose of the SPA was to serve in effect as an insurance policy in the event that, in light of the concerns that Mr Ipek already had, the Koza Group lost its ability to operate in T\u00fcrkiye and it was necessary instead to pursue a claim against the Republic.\n\n***c. 10 June\u201331 August 2015***\n-------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nIn the third period, up to and including Akin Ipek's endorsement of the share certificates on 31 August 2015, the key events are the following: Mr Ipek returned to T\u00fcrkiye on 12 August 2015. Koza-Ipek Holding held its AGM on 25 June 2015, with the Ipek Family members (and not the Claimant) participating as 'shareholders' and without mention of the 7 June 2015 transaction.453\n\nParticipant List for the General Assembly Meeting of 25 June 2015 [R-2]; Minutes of the 2014 Ordinary General assembly Meeting of Koza-Ipek holding A.\u015e., 25 June 2015, [R-102].\n\n400.\n\nThe Chief Public Prosecutor Anti-Constitutional Crimes Investigation Bureau requested detailed financial information from Koza Altin on 15 July 2015.454\n\nLetter from Office of Chief Public Prosecutor to Koza Altin, No 2014/119687 Investigation, 15 July 2015, [R-57].\n\n401.\n\nOn 29 August 2015, Koza Group's *Bug\u00fcn* newspaper reported on Fuat Avni's allegations made on Twitter that the assets of media and capital groups, such as the Ipek Group, 'will be seized'.455 On the same day, Mr Ipek attended an engagement ceremony with 1000 guests for his son in Ankara.456\n\n\"Shocking allegations from parallel Fuat Avni: Operation to Media and Capital\", *Bug\u00fcn*, 29 August 2015, [R-104].\n\nPhotographs of Mr Akin Ipek and family taken at his son's engagement party, 30 August 2015, [HAI-50]; Second Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [48].\n\n402.\n\nOn 30 August 2015, Mr Ipek flew to London on a Koza private jet and stayed at the Park Tower Hotel.457\n\nMinute prepared by the Financial Branch Officer regarding documents seized from Koza Group, 19 May 2017, [R-105]; Park Tower Hotel Information Invoice No 472484, 16 January 2017, [HAI-104].\n\n403.\n\nOn 31 August 2015, Akin Ipek in London issued a public statement, in which he states:\n\nCertain claims and gossips relating to some press outlets and capital groups, including our group, appeared on the social media.\n\nI tried not to pay attention but it does not end, [and] my phone keeps ringing.\n\nHere's our situation:\n\nOur group has 27 companies carrying out business activities in different sectors. 30 of our companies are being examined. For approximately two years.\u2026We are being examined and inspected by a total of eleven institutions.458\n\n\"Last minute disclosure of Ak\u0131n \u0130pek: Our thirty companies have been subject to investigation for last 2 years\", Gundem T24 press news, 31 August 2015, [R-4].\n\n404.\n\nOn the same day, he signed the Consent Document459 and endorsed the Koza-Ipek Holding share certificates of the Ipek Family in favour of the Claimant.\n\nWritten Consent of Hamdi Akin Ipek permitting the transfer of shares in Koza-Ipek Holding, 31 August 2015, [HAI-52].\n\n405.\n\nMeanwhile, also on 31 August 2015, in Ankara, the 7th Criminal Peace Court issued a search warrant for Akin Ipek's house, foundations and company headquarters on the basis of the Chief Public Prosecutor's investigation into Mr Ipek 'for the crime of being a leader in FET\u00d6 (Fethullah Terror Organisation)'.460 The Court also issued a warrant for the arrest of Akin Ipek.461\n\nSearch Warrant against Koza Group, 31 August 2015, [RfA-5].\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [50].\n\n406.\n\n*Tribunal's assessment.* The Tribunal cannot regard Akin Ipek's endorsement of the share certificates in London on 31 August 2015 as being simply the closing of a commercial transaction to restructure the Ipek Family's shareholdings in Koza-Ipek Holding under the umbrella of the Claimant, as the latter alleges.\n\n407.\n\nAlthough the date of 31 August 2015 was the date that had been provided for Closing in the SPA, there was no obligation to close in London. Mr Ipek explains that he deemed it necessary to fly to London with the share certificates (which he had deposited in his safe in T\u00fcrkiye) in order to endorse them in order to avoid paying stamp duty in T\u00fcrkiye and to deliver the certificates to the Claimant in London.462 But Morgan Lewis had advised him that endorsement of the share certificates in London would engage UK stamp duty. His only answer to this, when questioned about it at the hearing, was that he had received oral advice from Morgan Lewis to the contrary.463\n\nFourth Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [33].\n\nHearing T4/161/15\u201322.\n\n408.\n\nOn 29 August 2015, a Koza Group newspaper, *Bug\u00fcn*, had reported the tweeted allegation that the assets of the Ipek Group would be seized. Mr Ipek maintained that such tweets 'should not be taken seriously' and that 'it [was] not surprising to me that Bug\u00fcn newspaper would do so, however, because such topics were popularly and sensationally discussed in Turkish society.'464\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [74].\n\n409.\n\nHowever, Akin Ipek's own press statement of 31 August 2015 indicates that he was aware of these allegations, that they related to the Koza Group, and that he had reached the view that they were sufficiently serious to merit a formal response.\n\n410.\n\nMr Ipek was cross-examined about his press statement at the Hearing. He confirmed that:\n\nI gave this press statement following a tweet by Fuat Avni. Fuat Avni, I think on 28th August\u2013\u2013\u2026\u2013\u2013sent a tweet from his Twitter account and he said the 50% of the Turkish economy would be [confiscated/seized], and that there were steps being taken against these companies and their assets. So I was aware of these tweets. Because we had publicly traded companies, of course, I responded to this tweet.465\n\nHearing T3/75/25\u201376/10.\n\n411.\n\nQuestioned further on this by the President, Mr Ipek confirmed that, while the detail of the number of Koza companies referred to in the statement was not correct, 'this statement is correct'.466\n\nHearing T3/77/9.\n\n412.\n\nMr Ipek endorsed the share certificates on the same day as the Turkish court issued a search warrant for the search of his home and offices. The removal of the share certificates from his offices in T\u00fcrkiye ensured that they could not be seized there and could instead be endorsed by him in London.\n\n413.\n\nDespite the endorsement, Mr Ipek took no steps to complete the transaction by:\n\na. Issuing the Consideration Shares to the Ipek Family, which was not done until 17 October 2016 (over a year later);467 and\n\nb. Requesting Board approval and registration of the shares in T\u00fcrkiye, which was not sought until 23 December 2016.468 Instead Mr Ipek relied upon the Consent Document prepared by Witness 1 on 31 August 2015.\n\nIpek Investment Limited: Form SH01 - Return of Allotment of Shares, 17 October 2016, [R-68]; Request, [103].\n\nLetter from IIL to Koza-Ipek Holdings A.S., 23 December 2016, [RfA-14].\n\n414.\n\nIn his written witness statements, Akin Ipek denies that he had foreseen the search warrant, which was issued on 31 August 2015 and executed on 1 September 2015. He says that 'There was no forewarning of this raid, which came as a complete shock to all concerned.'469 He adds that he would not have left his family in T\u00fcrkiye had he known what was to happen, nor would he have left other assets in T\u00fcrkiye in reach of the Erdo\u011fan regime.470 He says that: 'We did not think that the Koza Group would be seized, and any attempt to do so would have been unlawful and unconstitutional. In fact, even after the raids, Tekin continued with his business trips to further expand the Koza Group.'471\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [50].\n\nibid, [68]\u2014[70].\n\nFourth Witness Statement of Mr Hamdi Akin Ipek, [43].\n\n415.\n\nAkin Ipek was questioned at the Hearing about the significance of the raids for the Closing of the SPA:\n\nQ: Where was your press release on 31st August 2015 announcing the fact that you had transferred 100% of the shares in Koza-Ipek Holding Limited to IIL?\n\nA: How can that be? We woke up to a different world on the 1st. There was no way of announcing or issuing a press release at that point.472\n\nHearing T3/112/16\u201321.\n\n416.\n\nHe continued to deny any expectation of the raid, but accepted that he could not return to T\u00fcrkiye on 1 September 2015, as there was an arrest warrant in his name effective immediately.473\n\nHearing T3/116/4\u201323.\n\n417.\n\nReturning to the effect of the raid on the Closing of the SPA transaction, Akin Ipek deposed that he had spoken about this in September 2015 to Mr Cartwright of Morgan Lewis, informing him that:\n\nWell, it was obvious that we couldn't close because there had been a raid on 1st September, the police were at the head office, it was obvious that we couldn't do closing, and they said there were things to be done on the UK side.\n\n...\n\nI spoke with Tom after the raid happened on 1st September 2015, it was a mess already. And he\u2013\u2013I said, \"once the policeman leaves our head office and things get calm down, we'll do the closing. I said \"we'll complete the part on the UK side\", apologies, what I mean, what I refer to as \"closing\" is to take care of the procedures that we had to complete on the UK side.474\n\nHearing T3/131/2\u20136; Hearing T3/131/13\u201320.\n\n418.\n\nAsked why he did not issue the Consideration Shares until October 2016, Akin Ipek deposed:\n\nBecause there was a raid, of course, on 1st September, and then a new world had started for us. And since we were expecting for the police to leave, just then the trustees were appointed and they said this would be temporary. But after that, of course, Tekin was arrested, and then came the coup.475\n\nHearing T3/132/15\u201320.\n\n419.\n\nTekin Ipek gave testimony as to the nature and effect of the raid on 1 September 2015:\n\nThere were 400\u2013500 police and there were 10\u201315 policemen in every room, there were documents being seized\u2026So it was a chaotic situation. Everyone, the staff were asked to leave\u2026\n\n...\n\nFrom the date the raid took place until the appointment of the trustees, the police never left the company\u2026476\n\nHearing T4/120/18\u201320; Hearing T4/121/7\u20139 and Hearing T4/121/18\u201319.\n\n420.\n\nWitness 1 added that the reason the SPA transaction was not consummated was because there was a raid the very next day and 'when the raid took place, the whole agenda changed.'477\n\nHearing T5/92/12.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal's conclusion on reasonable foreseeability**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Akin Ipek's actions on 31 August 2015 are consistent with his desire to use the SPA, as restructured on 7 June 2015, in order to secure a claim against the Republic in the event that the assets of Koza-Ipek Holding were seized. Such an outcome was reasonably foreseeable on 31 August 2015. Indeed Mr Ipek's actions on that date indicate to the Tribunal that (despite his denials) this outcome was foreseen by him. The Tribunal can find no other credible explanation for his removal of the share certificates from T\u00fcrkiye to London and their endorsement there on 31 August 2015. He took this step against the background of his knowledge of the allegation (reported in a Koza Group newspaper) that the Koza Altin assets were about to be seized. Mr Ipek regarded this allegation as sufficiently serious as to require the issue of a press statement in which he accepted that his companies were under investigation, but did not refer to the transfer of the family's shareholding to the Claimant.\n\n422.\n\nThis was the very day on which the Republic commenced the actions on which the Claimant itself relies as constituting breaches of the BIT. The Public Prosecutor's allegations in the search warrant and the raid the following day form the basis of the first grounds of complaint in the Request for Arbitration.478 They are pleaded as *'deliberate wrongful acts against the Claimant's Investment in breach of the fundamental obligations [T\u00fcrkiye]owed to the Claimant under the BIT'*.479\n\nRequest [8(a), (b)], [41].\n\nibid, [8].\n\n423.\n\nThe Claimant pleads that: '*These allegations of criminal conduct were fabricated to facilitate the seizure of the Koza Group Companies'*480 and states that, following the search, on 26 October 2015, Peace Criminal Judge S\u00fcer appointed interim trustees to 22 companies in the Koza Group, pending the conclusion of the criminal investigation.481 The Request adds that 'the Respondent has committed measures (*from 2015 onwards*) having the effect of expropriation.'482\n\nibid [42].\n\nibid [44]; Judgment of Yunus S\u00fcer at the Ankara 5th Civil Court of First Instance, 26 October 2015, [RfA-6].\n\nRequest, [113] (emphasis added).\n\n424.\n\nThe conclusion that the Tribunal draws, in the light of the totality of the events up to and including 31 August 2015, is that at the latest on that date, being the earliest date on which the Claimant could be said to have made an investment in the territory of the Respondent, the existence of a dispute between the Parties concerning that investment was reasonably foreseeable, indeed foreseen.\n\n425.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not neglect the Claimant's case that the dispute only crystallised on 1 September 2016, with the entry into force of Decree Law No 674 (enacted on 15 August 2016),483 which provided for the permanent appointment of the SDIF to replace the trustees originally appointed to the Koza Group companies' boards pursuant to art 133 of the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code on 26 October 2015.484 The Claimant argues it 'was at that point that a State entity was installed in place of the shareholders of the Koza Group companies and the deprivation of the Claimant's investment became permanent'.485\n\nDecree Law No.674 on certain measures to be taken under the state of emergency, 15 August 2016, [C-234].\n\nJudgment of Yunus S\u00fcer at the Ankara 5th Civil Court of First Instance, 26 October 2015, [RfA-6].\n\nRejoinder, [510]; see also Defence, [153] and [160].\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent submits a much earlier date for crystallisation, of either 13 May 2015 or July 2015.486 For the reasons already given above, the Tribunal rejects the 13 May 2015 date and treats the events of July 2015 as part of the evidence on reasonable foreseeability as at 31 August 2015.\n\nReply, [8], citing Letter from MASAK to Koza Altin entitled \"Information Request\", 13 May 2015, [R-49]. See also Reply, [344]; Memorial, [222] and [225]; and Hearing T1/41/13\u201321, citing letter from Chief Public Prosecutor to Koza Altin, 15 July 2015, [R-57]. See also Reply, [143].\n\n427.\n\nHowever, as already discussed,487 the question of law for the Tribunal is not when the dispute between the Parties had crystallised, but when it was reasonably foreseeable, such that an attempt to seize an ICSID Tribunal on the basis of claim advanced by a claimant whose legal interest had only been interposed as a result of a restructuring of the corporate group at that point would be inadmissible as an abuse of process.\n\nAbove [319]\u2014[325].\n\n428.\n\nAlthough the permanent appointment of the SDIF over the Koza Group assets took place over a year after the raid on 1 September 2015, the Tribunal concludes that the events form a continuum, such that the seizure of the assets was reasonably foreseeable on 31 August 2015. This is indeed what the Claimant pleads in its Request for Arbitration. All of the witnesses who gave evidence as to the raid on 1 September 2015, including Akin Ipek himself, were in no doubt as to its significance. It was 'a different world' in which the agents of the Republic had effectively taken control of the Group. Its employees had to leave; the police remained in place; and it was impossible for Mr Ipek to continue with his plans for the restructuring. The precise sequence of State measures that would follow may not have been known, but the effect of the measures already ordered on 31 August 2015 and taken the following day was clear enough. This is indeed the Claimant's own case, when it pleads that the allegations of criminal conduct made in the search warrant of 31 August 2015 'were fabricated to facilitate the seizure of the Koza Group Companies.'\n\n429.\n\nThe necessary consequence of this finding is that the Claimant's claim before this Tribunal is inadmissible: it being an abuse of the process of international arbitration under the BIT and the ICSID Convention for the members of the Ipek Family, all Turkish nationals, to seek to restructure their shareholding in Koza-Ipek Holding under a British company, and thereby to obtain the protections of the UK\u2013T\u00fcrkiye BIT at a time when the present dispute was reasonably foreseeable.\n\n**D. O****ther** **O****bjections**\n-----------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nIn light of its findings above, the Tribunal decides that it is unnecessary for it to determine the Respondent's first objection\u2013\u2013that the SPA is a sham\u2013\u2013or second objection\u2013\u2013as to the effect of Turkish law on the purported transfer.\n\n431.\n\nBy its Rejoinder, the Claimant also seeks a declaration that the Respondent has violated Article 47 of the ICSID Convention by its failure to comply with the Tribunal's provisional measures orders.488 Having determined that the Claimant's claim under the BIT is inadmissible, the Tribunal has no separate jurisdiction to determine this claim for relief.\n\nRejoinder, [568](c).\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n432.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n433.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2) adds that 'each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs *reasonably incurred* or borne by it in the proceeding.'489\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n434.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Hearing, the President directed the Parties to submit statements of costs, together with any submissions that they wished to advance thereon. He required these statements divide the costs between the **Initial Phase**, which had been primarily concerned with the application for provisional measures and related matters, and those costs strictly referable to the jurisdictional objection: the **Preliminary Objections Phase**.490\n\nHearing T9/161/16\u2013162/2.\n\n435.\n\nIn accordance with these directions, both Parties submitted written observations and schedules of costs on 1 November 2021.\n\n436.\n\nOn 2 November 2021, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal asking that it strike certain portions of the Respondent's submissions on the ground that they sought to reargue matters pertaining to the merits of the jurisdictional objections.\n\n437.\n\nOn 9 November 2021, the Respondent replied, arguing that the impugned portions of its submissions did not advance any new evidence or arguments on the question of jurisdiction. Rather they were directed at explaining why, in its view, the Claimant's conduct had needlessly increased the Respondent's fees and expenses. It submitted that, if the Tribunal were minded to strike the paragraphs from its costs submissions, it should do the same in relation to the like portions of the Claimant's costs submissions.\n\n438.\n\nOn 10 November 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had taken note of both Parties' communications.\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal has now considered both Parties' Costs Submissions. It finds that neither Party had exceeded the permissible scope of such submissions. So it declines to strike out any portion of either Costs Submission. The Tribunal will consider the weight to be attached to any particular point made as to the conduct of the proceedings in light of its own appreciation of the process to date.\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimant****'****s** **C****ost** **S****ubmissions**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nIn total the Claimant has submitted claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID), totalling \u00a39,556,915.40 (or US$11,668,445.83 at present exchange rates)491.\n\nhttps://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/ (visited on 7 December 2022).\n\n441.\n\nIn its submission on costs, the Claimant argues that, in the event that the Tribunal were to decide that it does not have jurisdiction, the Respondent should in any event bear the arbitration costs incurred by the Claimant up to 5 September 2019, totalling \u00a35,494,206.79, on the basis that the majority of time spent in this first period was devoted to the Claimant's applications for provisional measures and for witness anonymity and the Respondent's application for security for costs, on each of which the Claimant substantially prevailed.\n\n442.\n\nIt further submits that, in the event that it does not prevail, there ought to be no costs order against the Claimant for the period after 5 September 2019 on the grounds that: the Respondent failed to comply with the Tribunal's provisional measures order; pressured the Claimant's witnesses; refused to comply with the Tribunal's order as to witness anonymity; and otherwise failed to participate in the proceedings in good faith.\n\n**B. T****he** **R****espondent****'****s** **C****ost** **S****ubmissions**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nIn its submission on costs, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including the Respondent's legal fees and expenses totalling US$12,207,786.99 (excluding advances made to ICSID). Of that, the Respondent apportions US$3,565,024.29 to the initial phase.\n\n444.\n\nPutting to one side the Respondent's contributions to advances in respect of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Centre (which amount to US$775,000 for each Party), the total claimed by the Respondent in respect of the Preliminary Objections phase amounts to US$8,642,762.70.\n\n445.\n\nThe Respondent argues that a finding in its favour on abuse of process justifies an award of costs. It further submits that the Claimant failed to produce witnesses and documents and otherwise refused to engage in the proceedings in a manner that was conducive to proper determination of the issues.\n\n**C. T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s** **D****ecision on** **C****osts**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, read in conjunction with ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2), gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate the costs reasonably incurred in the conduct of the arbitration, including attorneys' fees and other costs, together with the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges of the Centre, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n447.\n\nWhile, as a general rule, 'a finding of abuse of process justifies an award of costs against the unsuccessful party,'492 at the same time, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, must take account of all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the Parties in the course of the arbitration. It must also determine whether, in respect of any allowed head of costs, the sum claimed is 'reasonable'.\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy v Peru,* ICSID Case No ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015, [RL-5] [201]; *Transglobal Green Energy LLC v Panama,* ICSID Case No ARB/13/28, Award, 2 June 2016, [RL-7] [126].\n\n448.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal takes into account in particular that the Initial Phase itself involved considerable time and expense. In that Phase, while it did not prevail on every point, the Claimant did substantially succeed, both in its own applications for provisional measures and in resisting the Respondent's application for security for costs.\n\n449.\n\nFurthermore, during the course of the preparations for the Preliminary Objections Phase, there were numerous contested applications for directions, which increased the Parties' costs. The Tribunal ruled in PO No 20 that the costs occasioned by that application were to be borne by the Respondent in any event.\n\n450.\n\nThe manner in which the Parties have chosen to present their costs breakdowns precludes exact computation of the costs incurred in respect of each Phase: the Claimant has applied a cut-off date of 5 September 2019 (which includes its costs incurred in filing its Defence on Preliminary Objections on that date), while the Respondent apportions a much lesser sum to the Initial Phase.\n\n451.\n\nIn circumstances in which each Party substantially prevailed respectively on the Initial Phase and the Preliminary Objections Phase, the Tribunal has decided that the most just and equitable solution is for each Party to bear its own costs and expenses of the proceeding.\n\n**D. T****he fees and expenses of the** **T****ribunal and the** **C****entre**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n452.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |\n| Campbell McLachlan | 499,480.32 |\n| The Hon. L. Yves Fortier | 267,507.73 |\n| Laurent L\u00e9vy | 264,403.45 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 210,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 301,404.39 |\n| **Total** | **1,542,795.89** |\n\n453.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.493 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 771,397.95.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n454.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as a result of the considerations that it has taken into account above in relation to the apportionment of the Parties' costs, the proper order in relation to the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges of the Centre for the proceedings is that each Party shall bear such costs in equal shares.\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes into account the more general point that the present Award is in no sense a vindication of the Respondent's position on the merits. Rather, the decision turns solely on the proper interpretation of the limited basis for jurisdiction afforded to the Tribunal under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. The Respondent's jurisdictional objections are, as the English Court of Appeal perforce accepted,494 a matter that the present Tribunal has competence to determine. Ensuring a fair trial of those objections posed substantial evidentiary challenges, which cannot be laid wholly at the door of either Party.\n\n*Koza Ltd and Hamdi Akin Ipek v Akcil and Others*, EWCA Civ 891, 2019, [RL-114] [39].\n\n**VIII. AWARD**\n---------------\n\n456.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(1) The claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible; as a result they are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\n(2) Pursuant to its discretion under Article 61 of the ICSID Convention:\n\na. Each Party shall bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges of the Centre for the proceedings; and\n\nb.
