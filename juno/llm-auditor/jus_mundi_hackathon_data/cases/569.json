PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request**\n----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn April 12, 2007, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a request for arbitration (the \"Request\") dated March 19, 2007, from Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. (\"Toto\") against the Republic of Lebanon (\"Lebanon\"). Toto is a company incorporated under the laws of Italy, registered at the commercial register of the Chamber of Commerce of Chieti.\n\n2.\n\nThe Request invoked the ICSID arbitration provisions contained in the Agreement between the Italian Republie and the Lebanese Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"Treaty\") which was signed on November 7, 1997, and entered into force on February 9, 2000.\n\n3.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request on April 12, 2007, and on April 13, 2007, transmitted copies thereof to Lebanon and its Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n4.\n\nIn the process of reviewing the Request, the Centre addressed a letter dated May 21, 2007, to Toto asking for clarification on the date on which the alleged dispute arose. The Claimant responded on May 25, 2007, specifying that the dispute arose in June 2004. Subsequently on July 3, 2007, the Centre registered the Request as supplemented by the letter of May 25, 2007, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\"). On the same day, the Centre notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed without delay to constitute an arbitral tribunal, in accordance with Institution Rule 7.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn June 8, 2007, Lebanon appointed Mr. Fadi Moghaizel, a Lebanese national, as arbitrator. By letter of 27 July 2007, the Centre informed Lebanon that it could not proceed with Mr. Moghaizel\u2019s appointment in view of Rule 1(3) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\") according to which the co-national of a party to a proceeding cannot be appointed as an arbitrator by a party without the agreement of the other party to the dispute. On August 21, 2007, Toto appointed Mr. Alberto Feliciani, an Italian national, as arbitrator, and proposed that it would not object to Lebanon\u2019s appointment of Mr. Moghaizel as a co-national of Lebanon provided that Lebanon does not object to Toto\u2019s appointment of Mr. Feliciani as a co-national of Toto. On September 24, 2007, Lebanon confirmed that it had no objection regarding Mr. Feliciani\u2019s appointment. On September 27, 2007, the parties filed a joint letter invoking Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and appointing Professor Hans van Houtte, a Belgian national, as the third, presiding arbitrator. On October 1, 2007, the Centre asked the parties to clarify whether Professor van Houtte\u2019s appointment was by the two party-appointed arbitrators, reflecting the method of constituting the Tribunal agreed by the parties, or by another method and, if so, to indicate which one. The parties informed the Centre by joint letter of October 16, 2007, that the appointment of the third arbitrator was by the two party-appointed arbitrators. Thus, the Centre contacted the two party-appointed arbitrators who, on October 19, 2007, confirmed their appointment of Professor van Houtte as the third arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Centre informed the parties, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 6(1), of the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and the commencement of the proceedings as of October 30, 2007, with Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, and later Ms. Aissatou Diop, serving as Secretary.\n\n**C. Written and Oral Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nBy joint letter of November 9, 2007, the parties proposed Paris as the venue of the proceedings. On November 20, 2007, the Tribunal, after consulting with the ICSID Secretariat, scheduled a first session with the parties for December 13, 2007, at the World Bank European Headquarters in Paris, France. By joint letter of December 6, 2007, the parties communicated their agreement on certain matters identified in the provisional agenda for the first session, which the Secretary had circulated in preparation for the first session.\n\n8.\n\nThe first session took place as scheduled. Participating were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\n1. Professor Hans van Houtte, *President*2. Mr. Alberto Feliciani, *Arbitrator*3. Mr. Fadi Moghaizel, *Arbitrator*\n\nICSID Secretariat\n\n4. Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, *Secretary of the Tribunal* (by video conference from Washington, D.C.)\n\nToto\n\n5. Mr. Bechara S. Hatem, Counsel, *Hatem, Kairouz, Moukheiber and Messihi Law Firm*6. Mr. Hadi Slim, Professeur de Droit, Consultant en Droit du Commerce\n\nLebanon\n\n7. Mr. Nabil B. Abdel-Malek, Counsel, *Nabil B. Abdel-Malek Law Offices*\n\n9.\n\nAt the session, the parties reiterated their agreement on the matters indicated in their joint letter of December 6, 2007, and reached an agreement on the remaining aspects of the proceedings, including bifurcation of the jurisdiction and merits phases, and a schedule for the submission of written pleadings on jurisdiction. All conclusions were recorded in the Minutes of the first session, which were signed by the President and Secretary of the Tribunal and circulated to the parties and other members of the Tribunal on January 15, 2008. The Minutes were subsequently amended at items 15 and 20, and re-circulated on February 27, 2008.\n\n10.\n\nThe following calendar was tentatively agreed for the preliminary phase of the proceedings:\n\n\u2022 Lebanon to file its Memorial on jurisdiction by February 29, 2008;\n\n\u2022 Toto to file its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction by April 30, 2008;\n\n\u2022 Lebanon to file a Reply on jurisdiction by June 30, 2008;\n\n\u2022 Toto to file a Rejoinder on jurisdiction by August 31, 2008;\n\n\u2022 A pre-hearing conference call to take place at the beginning of October 2008; and\n\n\u2022 A hearing for the examination of witnesses and/or experts, if any, or for oral arguments on jurisdiction to take place on October 16 and 17, 2008, in Paris.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule, the parties filed their submissions on the agreed dates, except Toto which filed its Rejoinder two days early, on August 29, 2008.\n\n12.\n\nOn September 8, 2008, the Centre invited the parties to submit items they wished to include on the agenda for the pre-hearing conference. On September 25, 2008, the parties submitted a response on the basis of which the Secretary prepared and circulated a provisional agenda on October 1, 2008. The Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference by telephone with the parties on October 3, 2008. During the pre-hearing conference, the Tribunal asked the parties to submit a synthesis of the agreed facts relating to jurisdiction, which the parties did on October 9, 2008. Before the conclusion of the pre-hearing conference, the parties reached an agreement on all the substantive, procedural, logistical, and administrative matters listed on the agenda circulated in advance of the pre-hearing conference. The parties\u2019 agreement was recorded in the Minutes of the pre-hearing conference which were circulated on October 7, 2008.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction at the World Bank European Headquarters in Paris, France, on October 16-17, 2008. The parties were represented by their respective Counsels who made presentations to the Tribunal. There were no witnesses. Present at the hearing were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\n1. Professor Hans van Houtte, *President*2. Mr. Alberto Feliciani, *Arbitrator*3. Mr. Fadi Moghaizel, *Arbitrator*\n\nToto\n\n4. Mr. Bechara S. Hatem, Counsel, *Hatem, Kairouz, Moukheiber and Messihi Law Firm*5. Mr. Hadi Slim, Professeur de Droit, Consultant en Droit du Commerce\n\nLebanon\n\n6. Mrs. Mireille Rached, Counsel, *Nabil B. Abdel-Malek Law Offices*7. Mr. Joseph Bsaibes, Counsel, *Nabil B. Abdel-Malek Law Offices*\n\n14.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Tribunal started to deliberate on the case. However, as both parties had not yet paid their share of the advance payment on arbitration costs requested by the Centre on September 29, 2008, in spite of several oral and written reminders, the deliberations had to be suspended. After Lebanon and thereafter Toto paid their respective shares of the advance, the deliberations could be resumed by the Tribunal and completed on June 15, 2008, leading to a decision which is reported herein.\n\n**II. THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------\n\n15.\n\nFor the purpose of this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal does not need to provide a detailed description of the factual background of the dispute between the parties. The Tribunal shall limit the scope of its decision to the jurisdiction issue and summarize the facts that are pertinent in that regard. Such summary, however, is not to be taken as prejudging in any way the issues of fact or law considered by this Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nThe dispute arose from a Contract dated 11 December 1997 entered into between the *Lebanese Republic - Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif des Grands Projets,* on one hand, and *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A.,* on the other hand, in the context of the construction of a portion of the Arab Highway linking, *inter alia,* Beirut to Damascus. Pursuant to the Contract, Toto undertook to build the section of the Arab Highway identified as the \"Hadath Highway-Syrian Border-Saoufar-Mdeirej Section.\"\n\n17.\n\nToto alleges that the Lebanese Government and first the *Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif des Grands Projets* (the \"CEGP\"), and later its successor, the Council for Development and Reconstruction (the \"CDR\"), acting on behalf of the Government, created numerous problems for Toto and/or refused to adopt adequate corrective measures. These actions and omissions, according to Toto, caused material damage to the construction of the Highway, jeopardized Toto\u2019s investment in Lebanon, and had, and are still having, a direct negative impact on the reputation of the Toto group. Toto seeks an award of damages for breaches of the Treaty and payment for moral prejudice.\n\n18.\n\nAlthough the Contract set a start date of February, 10, 1998, and a completion date of October, 24, 1999, for the execution of the works, *i.e.* a time-span of 20 months, the formal contractual time contemplated for completion was 18 months, with December, January and February being considered as one month because of weather conditions. Moreover, the Contract provided for a post-completion maintenance period of 12 months. The total contractually-provided time (including the maintenance and guarantee period) thus ended on 24 October 2000, i.e., 12 months after the contractual construction completion date. However, the actual construction was only completed in December 2003 and the project was handed over after the 12 month maintenance and guarantee period in December 2004.1\n\nRequest of Arbitration, p. 12.\n\n19.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2003, various claims were submitted by Toto to the CEPG and its successor the CDR. Such claims covered (a) additional costs due to changes in legislation leading to (i) change in customs duties, (ii) increase of the price of diesel, (iii) increase in government fees on cement, and (iv) increase in aggregates prices; (b) increase in the price of bitumen due to delayed execution; (c) additional works due to misleading information; (d) loss of productivity due to unforeseen circumstances; (e) additional costs occasioned by the nature of the soil not meeting the qualifications originally set in the Contract; (f) additional works resulting from a change in the design; (g) delayed site possession and expropriation and unforeseen works; and (h) extra works due to damages caused by third parties on site.\n\n20.\n\nIn August 2001, Toto filed two claims before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* (the Lebanese Administrative Court). Pursuant to the first claim, submitted on August 1, 2001, Toto requested to be indemnified for unforeseen works it had to carry out because the nature of soil did not meet the specifications set out in the Contract. Pursuant to the second claim, submitted on August 24, 2001, Toto requested to be indemnified for additional works it had to carry out because the design specified in the Contract had been substantially changed.\n\n21.\n\nOn June 30, 2004, Toto addressed a letter to Lebanon extending an invitation to negotiations between the parties for possible settlement as per Article 7 of the Treaty (cited in paragraph 24 *infra)* and, in the alternative, requesting arbitration. On August 18, 2004, Lebanon informed Toto that the CDR\u2019s Board of Directors had appointed its President to carry out the negotiations.\n\n22.\n\nIn October 2004, a new Lebanese Government came into power and decided to nominate a new Board of Directors for the CDR. The new Board was effectively appointed in December 2004.\n\n23.\n\nOn May 11, 2005, Toto attempted to restart the negotiations, addressing a letter to the new President of the CDR\u2019s Board of Directors. Toto did not receive an answer to this second request for negotiations. According to Toto, up to its filing of the Request for Arbitration in March 2007, it continuously tried to negotiate a settlement but remained unsuccessful.\n\n24.\n\nBy its Request for Arbitration, Toto submitted the dispute to ICSID arbitration in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and on the basis of Article 7 of the Treaty which states:\n\n*1. In case of disputes regarding investments between a Contracting* *Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, consultations will take place between the Parties concerned with a view to solving the case, as far as possible, amicably.*\n\n*2. If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of written request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute, at his choice, for settlement to:*\n\n*a) ...*\n\n*b) the International Center (sic) for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) provided for by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of the other States, opened for signature at* *Washington, on March 18, 1965, in case both Contracting Parties have become members of this Convention; or*\n\n*c) ...*\n\n25.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Toto alleged various breaches of the Treaty by Lebanon, such as changing the regulatory framework; delaying or failing to carry out the necessary expropriations; failing to deliver sites; failing to protect Toto\u2019s legal possession; and giving erroneous design information and instructions. Moreover, Toto asserts that the fact that the Lebanese *Conseil d\u2019Etat* had not yet decided on the two cases pending before it, from August 2, 2001, to the date of submission of the Request for the Arbitration, constitutes a denial of justice.\n\n26.\n\nAs a result of the alleged breaches, Toto submits the following request for relief:\n\n***10.1. The Claimant respectfully requests an award in its favour***\n\n*10.1.1. Declaring that the Respondent has breached its legal obligations under the BIT, thus jeopardizing the Investment made by the Claimant through the Contract and caused damages to said Investment;*\n\n*10.1.2.

Directing the Respondent to pay the Claimant the arbitration and arbitrators' fees and expenses as will be substantiated later on, as well as the Claimant's attorneys fees;*\n\n*10.2. Ordering any such further relief as may be available and appropriate in the* *circumstances.*\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe submissions of the parties can be briefly summarized as follows, without prejudice or limitation of their actual content, which has been considered in details by the Tribunal:\n\n**A. Lebanon\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nLebanon argues that the claims made by Toto fall outside the jurisdiction of ICSID, asserting that the building of the Arab Highway is not an investment as intended in the ICSID Convention, that Toto was not entitled to invoke Article 7(2) of the Treaty to submit claims to an ICSID arbitral tribunal, that Lebanon had not committed breaches of the Treaty and is not directly a party to the Contract, and that the claims are contractual claims and not Treaty claims.\n\n29.\n\nLebanon asserts that the dispute settlement clause stated in the Contract has priority over the general jurisdiction clause contained in the Treaty.\n\n30.\n\nAccording to Lebanon\u2019s Memorial, Toto\u2019s choice to submit to the Lebanese Courts the disputes arising out of the Contract is final under Article V.1.2 of the *Cahier des Clauses Juridiques et Administrative,* which is part of the Contract and precludes Toto from resorting to ICSID arbitration.\n\n31.\n\nLebanon stresses that the Treaty entered into force in February 2000 and, under its Article 10, does not apply to disputes that have arisen before that date. In addition, Lebanon adhered to the ICSID Convention only in 2003 thus excluding to submit to ICSID all the disputes for alleged breaches that had arisen before the ICSID Convention entered into force.\n\n**B. Toto\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nToto, in its Counter-Memorial, infers that, notwithstanding the dispute settlement mechanism provided for in the Contract, the Treaty provisions and the ICSID Convention entitle referral of the dispute to an ICSID arbitration panel.\n\n33.\n\nAccording to Toto\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Lebanon was a direct party to the Contract and the alleged breaches are to be considered as Treaty breaches because they relate to public works, which implies the exercise of *puissance publique.*\n\n34.\n\nToto rejects Lebanon\u2019s position of lack of jurisdiction *rationae temporis* of the Tribunal, asserting that Article 10 of the Treaty gives retroactive effect to the ICSID Convention.\n\n**C. Lebanon\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nLebanon reaffirms that the alleged claims have to be treated as contractual ones and not as Treaty breaches.\n\n36.\n\nLebanon argues that Toto did not point to any action taken by Lebanon which can be considered as discriminatory.\n\n37.\n\nLebanon asks the Tribunal to grant relief only for Treaty breaches, if any, and not for damages resulting from any other breaches.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to Lebanon, Lebanon is not a party to the Contract because it was entered into between Toto and the CDR, a council with separate legal personality from the State.\n\n39.\n\nLebanon reiterates that the claims set forth in the Request are essentially contractual in nature. Thus, the agreement between Toto and the CDR to submit their disputes to the Lebanese courts should prevail over the general dispute settlement provisions of the Treaty.\n\n40.\n\nLebanon asserts that ICSID arbitration would be premature until Toto\u2019s contractual claims are decided by the competent Lebanese courts.\n\n**D. Toto\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nToto in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction denies Lebanon\u2019s assertions, reiterates its assertion of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the dispute as submitted in the Request and makes reference to and confirms all arguments set out in the Request for Arbitration and in the Counter-Memorial.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn its analysis, the Tribunal has determined the points that must be studied in accordance with the claims submitted by Toto and with Lebanon\u2019s response. For every point, the Tribunal has summarized the position of the two parties to the arbitration and then stated its decision with due regard to the arguments put forward by each of them.\n\n**A. Relationship between the CEGP and its successor, the CDR, and the State of Lebanon**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Republic of Lebanon, which is the Respondent in the present arbitration, is a Contracting Party to the Treaty on which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based as well as a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention, under which rules the arbitration proceedings are conducted. However, Toto concluded the contract, which lies at the origin of the dispute, with the CEGP, later succeeded by the CDR, and the claims follow from acts and omissions of the CEGP and the CDR. Lebanon will only be held responsible under the Treaty for such acts and omissions that can be attributed to Lebanon.\n\n44.\n\nThe principal rule of international law on attribution are presently reflected in Articles 4 and 5 of the International Law Commission\u2019s (\"ILC\") Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001 (\"Draft Articles\").\n\nArticle 4 reads :\n\n*Conduct of organs of a State*\n\n*The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.*\n\nArticle 5 reads :\n\n*Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority*\n\n*The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law; provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.*\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has to determine whether the CEGP and the CDR are State organs or entities exercising governmental authority as defined above.\n\n45.\n\nIn the event the domestic law of Lebanon would consider the CEGP and/or the CDR as State organs, they would unquestionably have the status of State organs under international law. Indeed, under Article 4.2 of the ILC Draft Articles, \"[a]n *organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\"*\n\n46.\n\nIn the event that Lebanese law would not give the CEGP and/or the CDR the status of State organs, the Tribunal will have to examine whether these bodies exercise executive or any other functions of the Republic of Lebanon, as required under Article 4.1 of the ILC Draft Articles. The circumstances in which the CEGP and/or the CDR would be considered separate entities pursuant to Lebanese law would be irrelevant in this context: a State cannot escape international responsibility by delegating its State functions to entities to which it gives separate legal personality under its domestic law.2\n\nSee K. Hober, *State Responsibility and Attribution,* in P. Muchlinski e.a., Ed., International Investment Law, Oxford University Press 2008, 549 at 582.\n\n47.\n\nIf the CEGP and/or the CDR do not have the status of State organs under Lebanese law, but they exercise some of the functions of governmental authority, enumerated in Article 4.1 of the ILC Draft Articles, their acts and/or omissions in the exercise of governmental authority would still be attributable to Lebanon under the principle formulated in Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine to which extent these principles apply in the case at stake and make the acts and/or omissions of the CEGP and the CDR attributable to Lebanon.\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n48.\n\nToto argues that the CEGP was fully controlled by the Government of Lebanon through the Ministry of Public Works and Transport. The CEGP undertook only public works projects entrusted to it by the Council of Ministers of the Lebanese Government. Moreover, the President and Board of Directors of the CEGP were appointed by decree of the Council of Ministers and its funding came mainly from the State budget.\n\n49.\n\nToto adds that, following the merger by absorption of the CEGP by the CDR, the CDR replaced the Ministry of Planning and became the successor of the CEPG in all its rights and obligations, including the Contract in the matter at hand. The CDR ensures the study and implementation of the public works entrusted to it by the Council of Ministers. Its President and Board of Directors are designated by the Council of Ministers. Its projects are funded by the State budget and are awarded in line with the public adjudication process. Therefore, Toto concludes that the CEGP and, later, the CDR are two entities acting on behalf of the Republic of Lebanon to carry out public works projects decided by the Council of Ministers, and they thus form one single entity with the State.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n50.\n\nLebanon contends that it is not a party to the Contract which was signed by the CEGP and assumed by the CDR, two independent entities that are distinct from the State. Both the CEGP and the CDR have financial and administrative autonomy. Lebanon adds that the Contract itself names the CEGP as the contacting party. The same applies to the *Cahier des Charges Juridiques et Administrative* (Article 1.03) which names the CEGP as the employer. Lebanon explains further that it does not take part in the implementation of the projects carried out by the CEGP; and later, the CDR. Lebanon concludes that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because Article 7 of the Treaty does not apply to breaches of contracts by entities that are not the State.\n\n*Tribunal* s *Decision*\n-----------------------\n\nThe status of the CEGP\n----------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Contract was initially made with the CEGP, which was established by Decree no. 6839 of June 15, 1961. Article 1 of this Decree provided that the CEPG is in charge of studying and implementing the projects entrusted to it by the Council of Ministers. The CEPG was attached to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport which monitored the execution of the projects entrusted to the CEPG. The CEPG had a distinct legal personality and enjoyed administrative and financial autonomy. However, it operated under the control of the aforementioned Ministry and the authority of the Council of Ministers, and was also subject to the disciplinary authority of the Central Inspectorate. The CEPG had its own funds, which originated from the amounts allocated in the State budget to the projects to be performed by the CEPG.\n\n52.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the CEPG, being an *\u00e9tablissement public administratif* linked to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and operating under the authority of the Council of Ministers, was a public entity (*\"personne morale de droit public\")* that was created and mandated by Lebanon to exercise elements of governmental authority.\n\n53.\n\nIn brief, the CEPG, with projects funded by the State budget, and in charge of implementing the decisions of the Council of Ministers, exercised Lebanese governmental authority when it entered into the Contract with Toto. As also confirmed by Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles, its conduct has to be considered as an act of the Lebanese state.\n\nThe Status of the CDR\n---------------------\n\n54.\n\nBy Law no. 295 of April 5, 2001, the CEGP was absorbed by the CDR, which assumed all the rights and obligations of the CEPG (Article 1, amending Article 15 of Law no. 247 of August 7, 2000). Following the absorption, all the projects entrusted to the CEPG were transferred to the CDR including the Contract at hand, made between the CEPG and Toto in 1997. The CDR therefore became the universal successor *{ayant cause universel}* to the CEPG. The Contract made by the CEPG with Toto thus has been transferred to the CDR. In this way the CDR equally exercised elements of governmental authority of the Republic of Lebanon.\n\n55.\n\nMoreover, as to its institutional status, the CDR is a public entity (in the form of an *\u00e9tablissement public administratif}* established by Decree-Law no. 5 of January 31, 1977. It has a legal personality and enjoys administrative and financial autonomy. It is directly attached to the Council of Ministers.\n\n56.\n\nThe CDR has two types of prerogatives. It acts autonomously, notably for the tasks of the Ministry of Planning that were transferred to the CDR when the CDR replaced the Ministry pursuant to Decree-Law no. 5 of January 31, 1977. Moreover, the CDR acts as an agent of the State.\n\n57.\n\nThe CDR acts autonomously when, as the Council of Ministers\u2019 consultant, it plans and programs development and reconstruction and elaborates the economic, social, and financial policy to attain the set objectives.3 The CDR prepares the budget relating to the implementation of the general plan that it lays down, and it ensures consistency between the State budget and the general plan by giving its opinion regarding the draft of the State budget law.4 It also acts as a consulting authority for the drafting of legislation falling within the scope of development and reconstruction.5 However, all the plans and projects entrusted to the CDR must finally be approved by the Council of Ministers.\n\nArticle 3-1 of Decree-Law no. 5.\n\nArticle 3-2 of Decree-law no. 5.\n\nArticle 4, paragraph 1 of Decree-Law no. 5.\n\n58.\n\nThe CDR, however, mainly acts as the agent and implementing authority of the Lebanese Government. Pursuant to Article 5 of Decree-Law no. 5, it is in charge of studying and implementing development and reconstruction projects. It elaborates and implements the projects included in the general plan and the successive plans as well as any development and reconstruction projects assigned to it by the Council of Ministers.\n\n59.\n\nThe CDR implements all the projects entrusted to it by the Council of Ministers in the field of reconstruction and development, in areas stricken by war or natural disasters, and areas posing a threat to public health and safety.6 Through adjudication, solicitation of proposals or mutual agreement, it designates the public authority, public entity, municipality, mixed company, or private company which will perform the project. It represents all the public authorities and municipalities in their expropriation prerogatives: it carries out expropriations on behalf of all public authorities and municipalities.7 It controls all the projects included in the general plan, the projects established by it and the projects entrusted to it by the Council of Ministers.8 The funds allocated to the performance of the projects included in the plans approved by the Council of Ministers are provided for in the State budget.\n\nIn line with Decree-Law no. 107 of June 30, 1977.\n\nArticle 5, paragraph 3 of Decree-Law no. 5.\n\nArticle 7-1 of Decree-Law no. 5.\n\n60.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal\u2019s view is that the CEGP and thereafter the CDR are exercising in the context of the Contract the governmental authority of the Republic of Lebanon, Therefore their acts are acts of the State of Lebanon, as also confirmed by Article 5 of the ILC Draft. Lebanon may be internationally liable for the acts of the CEGP and thereafter the CDR. This means that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty for acts committed by the CEGP and the CDR.\n\n**B. Is there an Investment?**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. An investment as defined in the Treaty?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n61.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration Toto argues that the dispute arises out of an investment as defined in the Treaty. Article 1.2 of the Treaty states:\n\n*The term \"investment\" means every kind of asset established or acquired by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter and shall include particularly, but not exclusively:*\n\n*a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens, and pledges;*\n\n*b)...*\n\n*c) claims to money which have been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance having an economic value;*\n\n*d) intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, patents, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, technical processes, know-how and goodwill, as well as other similar rights recognized by the laws of the Contracting Parties;*\n\n*[...]*\n\n62.\n\nIn arguing for the existence of an investment in the sense of Article 1.2 of the Treaty, Toto points out several elements:\n\n(a) the claims for payment of amounts that were necessary \"to create an economic value,\" i.e., major infrastructure works for the building of the Saoufar-Mdeirij section of the Arab Highway, including the construction of the highest viaduct of the Middle East (Treaty, Article 1.2.c). These claims are listed in the Request for Arbitration (Section 6, p. 25) and include:\n\n- a claim for reimbursement of the extra charges incurred by Toto as a result of a change in legislation after the submission of the tender;\n\n- a claim for payment of the cost of additional works carried out upon the request or with the approval of the Respondent;\n\n- a claim for compensation for losses incurred as a result of delays attributable to the Respondent;\n\n- a claim for compensation for extra costs resulting out of misleading information;\n\n- a claim for payment of interest on all outstanding amounts due to delayed payments during the execution of the Contract.\n\n(b) \"the industrial designs or models... know-how and goodwill\" (Treaty, Article 1.2.d): for the execution of the construction project Toto brought in especially skilled personnel from Italy.\n\n(c) \"movable property\" (Treaty, Article 1.2.a): heavy equipment, machinery and technical processes were brought in by Toto for the purpose of carrying out the project.\n\n63.\n\nToto contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction because the dispute arises out of an \"investment\" in the sense of the Treaty. It refers in this context to *M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine inc. v. Ecuador,9* in which the Tribunal stated that elements such as duration and risk, which some Tribunals take into account to accept the existence of a Treaty-protected investment, are not essential or required elements for the existence of an investment but rather mere illustrations.\n\n*MCI Power Group LC and New Turbine Inc v. Ecuador,* Award, ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/03/6, IIC 296 (2007), 31 July 2007.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n64.\n\nLebanon disagrees with Toto that it is sufficient that the dispute arises out of an \"investment\" as it is defined in the Treaty to be within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. What Toto must prove, and has failed to prove, according to Lebanon, is that the dispute arises out of an \"investment\" as understood in the ICSID Convention. Otherwise, the mere agreement of the parties on the scope of \"investments\" in a bilateral investment treaty would become the sole determinant of the ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n*Tribunal's Decision*\n---------------------\n\n65.\n\nThis Tribunal agrees with Toto that in the case at hand the requirements for an \"investment\" as set forth in Article 1.2 of the Treaty are indeed fulfilled since an investor of Italy has established in accordance with Lebanese laws and regulations in the territory of Lebanon assets which included movable property (Article 1.2 a of the Treaty), claims to money which have been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance having an economic value (Article 1.2 c of the Treaty), and technical processes and know-how (Article 1.2 d of the Treaty).\n\n**2. An investment as per the meaning of the ICSID Convention ?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThis being said, given that the case at hand is submitted to an ICSID Tribunal, the Tribunal agrees with Lebanon that, for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction, it is not sufficient that the dispute arises out of an investment as per the meaning of \"investment\" given by the parties in the Treaty, but also as per the meaning of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.\n\n67.\n\nArticle 25.1 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (...) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.*\n\n68.\n\nThe ICSID Convention itself does not set forth a definition of the term \"investment\" which it mentions in its Article 25 as a requirement to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. However, as Lebanon points out, its preparatory works do not suggest in any manner that by leaving out such a definition the founders of ICSID intended to bestow upon the Centre a jurisdiction *ratione materiae* without limits.\n\n69.\n\nThe notion of \"investment\" under the ICSID system has been clarified by legal scholars and jurisprudence. A number of legal scholars and some ICSID Tribunals follow the four criteria to be found in *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A.* v. *Kingdom of Morocco10* to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an \"investment\" in the sense of the ICSID Convention. These four criteria, sometimes called the *Salini* test, comprise a) duration, b) a contribution on the part of the investor, c) a contribution to the development of the host state, and d) some risk taking.\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.P.A. and Italstrade S.P.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/00/4, 42 ILM 609 (2003), 23 July 2001 *{Salini v. Morocco).*\n\n*Toto s Position*\n-----------------\n\n70.\n\nAlthough Toto, as noted above, regards compliance with the requirements of the Treaty as sufficient to determine the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, it contends that the dispute at hand relates to an \"investment\" also in the sense of the ICSID Convention. Toto argues that the four criteria of the *Salini* test are fulfilled:\n\n- the **perpetuation of the contract for a certain period of time:** the expected duration was 30 months (including the maintenance period), but the execution of the Project ended up taking more than five years.\n\n- a **contribution by the investor: Toto brought in its own skilled personnel,** heavy equipment and machinery required because the nature of the works, including the building of the highest viaduct in the Middle East. The works required indeed specialized skills and knowledge.\n\n- a **substantial contribution to the State\u2019s economic development:** Toto\u2019s involvement in the Project significantly contributed to the economical development of Lebanon: the highway built by Toto is part of the backbone of Lebanese economic activity, connecting Lebanon with Syria and other Arab countries, making Lebanon a passage way for international trade between Europe and the Middle East;\n\n- a **risk:** the risk stems from the nature of the Contract. Toto refers to *Salini v.* *Morocco:*\n\n*With regard to the risks incurred by the Italian companies, these flow from the nature of the contract at issue.... Notably, among others the risk associated with the prerogatives of the Owner permitting him to prematurely put an end to the contract, to impose variations within certain limits without changing the manner of fixing prices; the risk consisting of the potential increase in the cost of labour in case of modification of Moroccan law; any accident or damage caused to property during the performance of the works; those risks relating to problems of co-ordination possibly arising from the simultaneous performance of other projects; any unforeseeable incident that could not be considered as force majeure and which, therefore, would not give rise to a right to compensation; and finally those risks related to the absence of any compensation in case of increase or decrease in volume of the work load not exceeding 20% of the total contract price.11*\n\nCf. *supra,* footnote 10, para. 55,\n\n71.\n\nRegarding the element of risk, Toto also refers to *SAIPEM v. Bangladesh,12* in which the Tribunal states that the fact that the investor receives an advance payment does not mean that it does not incur commercial risks. Moreover the exorbitant clauses that contribute to the risk element in *SAIPEM v. Bangladesh* also exist in the present case, where furthermore no advance payment has been received: \"the contract, the construction, the retention money, the warranty, in addition to other dispositions concerning non scheduled works, increase or decrease of the volume of works, variation of economical conditions, which are also exorbitant clauses.\"13 On each monthly payment, 10% had to be retained as retention money.14\n\n*Saipem S.p.A.* v. *The People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on provisional measures, para. 110.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, 29 August 2008, para 86. Toto refers to Exhibit 11 of its Request for Arbitration: CEDG, Autoroute Hadath - Fronti\u00e8re Syrienne, Tron\u00e7on Saoufar-Mdeirej, *Cahier des Clauses Juridiques et Administrative,* Articles I-10, ITI-01, III-02, III-04, IV-03\n\nArticle IV.03 (2) of the *Cahier des Clauses Juridiques et Administratives, (\"Attachements et \u00e9tablissement des d\u00e9comptes\")*\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n72.\n\nAccording to Lebanon, Toto failed to prove that the Project meets the definition of an \"investment\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. Lebanon does not object to the application of the *Salini* criteria; indeed it applies such criteria itself. However, it argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the dispute at hand does not arise out of an investment, since, in its view, the Contract does not involve taking risks.\n\n73.\n\nFor Lebanon, an investment requires the specific risk that the operation might not be profitable, not the general risk that some contractual obligation will not be honoured, since the latter kind of risk is inherent to any contract whatsoever. The possibility that a contractual obligation will be defaulted or that a force majeure event may occur, is not the kind of risk required to qualify the operation as an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.\n\n74.\n\nFor Lebanon a road construction contract, such as the present Contract, involves a commercial sale of goods and services and is not an \"investment,\" since the contractor\u2019s remuneration is guaranteed under the contract and covers the profits and estimated costs and risks. It is only when a construction contract is linked with the management of the operation, whereby the contractor\u2019s remuneration is contingent on the outcome of its management and whereby profits depend on the success of the operation that such construction contract may be considered part of an investment.\n\n75.\n\nLebanon points out that, in those ICSID cases in which the Tribunal had to decide on the qualification of a civil engineering contract, the contract constituted part of an entrepreneurial activity, such as the building and operation of a hotel, the construction of housing units, the construction and management of a hospital ward, etc.15 In such cases, the risk that was taken into consideration for qualifying the operation as an investment under the ICSID Convention was the one associated with the chances of success of the business operation.\n\n*AMCO* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID case n\u00b0 ARB/81/1; *Holiday Inns S.A. and other v. Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1; *Gabon* v. *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Serete S.A.,* ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/76/1; *Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroun and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/81/1; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels v. S\u00e9n\u00e9gal,* ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/82/1; *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/01/7.\n\n76.\n\nLebanon refers to *SAIPEM* v. *Bangladesh,* in which the Tribunal considered the entire operation, including \"the Contract, the construction itself, the Retention Money, the warranty, and the related ICC Arbitration,\"16 and not just the civil construction part of it. According to Lebanon, it was exorbitant clauses like the retention money of 10% that led the Tribunal in *SAIPEM v. Bangladesh* to decide that there was a risk in the operation and to qualify it as an investment.\n\nCf. *supra,* footnote 12, para. 110.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n77.\n\nLebanon\u2019s argument that there is no element of risk in the present case is unconvincing. The Tribunal finds, rather, that the criteria as set forth by legal scholars and jurisprudence following *Salini* v. *Morocco* are met in the present case.17\n\nThis conclusion holds regardless of the discussion between the parties as to how these requirements should be assessed. Toto argues that the criteria as defined in the *Salini* v. *Morocco* are to be assessed globally rather than cumulatively. Toto refers to Farouk Yala, *\"Rapport pr\u00e9liminaire La notion d\u2019\u00ab investissement \u00bb dans la jurisprudence du CIRDI : actualit\u00e9 d\u2019un crit\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence controvers\u00e9\", Colloque* 3 mai 2004, p. 6, para. 18-19; \"... *une op\u00e9ration d\u2019investissement suppose la r\u00e9union de quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments interd\u00e9pendants*... \". Toto contends that *\"interd\u00e9pendent\"* should be translated as \"interrelated\" and not as \"cumulative\". According to Lebanon, the Tribunal in *Salini v. Morocco* did require the four conditions to exist cumulatively.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Toto that the risk stems from the nature of the contract and, as stated in *Salini v. Morocco,* does not require that the investor be \"linked to the exploitation of the completed work.\"18 A construction contract in which the execution of the works extends over a substantial period of time involves by definition an element of risk.19 The duration of the contract is a determining factor with regards to the magnitude of the risk since the exposure to changes and unexpected occurrences increases in proportion to the duration of the contract.\n\nCf. *supra,* footnote 10, para. 56.\n\nOne might argue whether it is the expected or the actual duration of the project that should be considered, but in either case the criterion of duration would be passed.\n\n79.\n\nLebanon\u2019s argument that Toto\u2019s alleged risk was covered by a \"guaranteed payment\" does not stand: profits and costs are seldom fully covered by a payment agreed in advance when the price has been negotiated competitively and when many unforeseen events may occur.\n\n80.\n\nIn this regard this Tribunal refers to *SAIPEM v. Bangladesh,* in which the Tribunal stated: *\"Bangladesh\u2019s argument appears to refer more to... the fact that the investor did not incur any commercial risk because it received an advanced payment. The Tribunal cannot agree with this argument. In the present case, the undisputed stopping of the works which took place in 1991 and the necessity to renegotiate the completion date constitute examples of inherent risks in long term contracts.\"20*\n\nCf. *supra,* footnote 12, para. 109.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, regarding the issue of investment, the requirements for jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention are fulfilled in this case. However, the Tribunal wishes to make clear that it does not reach this conclusion strictly on the basis of the *Salini* test, even if it agrees with Toto that in the present case that test is met, as demonstrated above. The Tribunal deviates from this commonly followed test in a desire to delineate the necessary features of an investment in a way that it considers more appropriate to the present case.\n\n82.\n\nIt should indeed be noted that the *Salini* test has not been universally applied by ICSID Tribunals. An alternative set of criteria was used, for example, in an award rendered on July 24, 2008 in the ICSID case *Biwater v. Tanzania21* in which the Tribunal stated that there is no basis for a \"rote or overly strict\" application of the test in every case:\n\n*These criteria are not fixed or mandatory as a matter of law. They do not appear in the ICSID Convention. On the contrary, it is clear from the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the Convention that* *several attempts to incorporate a definition of \u2018investment\u2019 were made, but ultimately did not succeed.22*\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd.* v. *United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID ease 05/22, para. 312\n\nCfi *supra,* footnote 21, para. 310. In *Biwater* v. *Tanzania* the Tribunal attributes five, rather than four, criteria to *Salini* v. *Morocco.* These five criteria were originally suggested by the Tribunal in *Fedax N.V.* v. *Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID case ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction of July 11, 1997, 5 ICSID Rep. 183 (2002): (i) duration, (ii) regularity of profit and return, (hi) assumption of risk, (iv) substantial commitment, and (v) significance for the host State\u2019s development. Four of these criteria were taken over by the Tribunal in *Salini.*\n\n83.\n\nAs stated in *Biwater v. Tanzania,* in the ICSID Convention the term \"investment\" *\"was left intentionally undefined, with the expectation (inter alia) that a definition could be the subject of agreement as between Contracting States.\"23* And: \"[g]iven *that the Convention was not drafted with a strict, objective, definition of \u2018investment\u2019, it is doubtful that arbitral tribunals sitting in individual cases should impose one such definition which would be applicable in all cases and for all purposes.\"24*\n\nCf. *supra,* footnote 21, para. 312, with reference to Ch. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), p. 121-125, paras. 80-88.\n\nCf. *supra,* footnote 21, para. 313.\n\n84.\n\nIn the absence of specific criteria or definitions in the ICSID Convention, the underlying concept of investment, which is economical in nature, becomes relevant: it implies an economical operation initiated and conducted by an entrepreneur using its own financial means and at its own financial risk, with the objective of making a profit within a given period of time. It has been argued that \"investment\" should include some duration, e.g., a minimum duration of two years, although a shorter duration also may be conceivable, or that the investment should serve the public interest.25\n\nThis is not a requirement of the ICSID Convention. See *L.E.S.I. S.p.A. et Astaldi S.p.A. v. R\u00e9publique alg\u00e9rienne d\u00e9mocratique et populaire,* ICSID case 05/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, July 12, 2006, para 72 (iv) : *\u00abIl ne parait en revanche pas n\u00e9cessaire qu \u2019il r\u00e9ponde en plus sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 la promotion \u00e9conomique du pays, une condition de toute fa\u00e7on difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir et implicitement couverte par les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments retenus. \u00bb*\n\n85.\n\nAdditional criteria have been applied in some cases, for example, in *Phoenix v. Czech Republic,* in which the Tribunal added two criteria to have an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention: that assets be invested in accordance with the laws of the host state and that they be invested bona fide.26 These two criteria, however, are not relevant to the case at hand.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd, v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/06/5, Award, April 15, 2009, para. 114.\n\n86.\n\nIn the present case, Toto\u2019s construction project meets the requirements deemed necessary by this Tribunal, i.e., a contribution by the investor, a profitability risk, a significant duration and a substantial contribution to the State\u2019s economic development, as follows:\n\n(a) Toto used its financial means before, during, and until completion of the works. At the start of the project, organizing personnel, machineries, and materials involved expenditures. The investment remains even though the contractor receives payments during the progress of the work. Indeed, these payments are received only after the contractor has pre-financed himself the costs of personnel, machineries, and materials. Moreover, as the costs must be certified by the engineer in order to obtain payment, there is always a risk that the costs will not be approved. Furthermore, 10% of the amounts, certified by the engineer, was retained as retention money, of which half would be paid at the provisional taking over and half at the final taking over.\n\n(b) There is no guarantee that the price paid by Lebanon, the employer, will be sufficient to cover the actual costs of the contractor for the performance of its obligations, especially since many unknown factors might intervene.\n\n(c) Toto was involved in the investment for well over five years (and even well over six years if Toto\u2019s maintenance period is also included). Several activities were carried out during the period in order to perform its contractual obligations.\n\n(d) The project at hand is a major construction work that will facilitate land transportation between Lebanon, Syria and other Arab countries and thus increase Lebanon\u2019s position as a transit country for goods from and to Middle East countries.\n\n87.\n\nThus, it is the considered conclusion of this Tribunal that the construction carried out by Toto in Lebanon was an \"investment\" according to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and as such, the disputes related to this construction qualify for the ICSID arbitration.\n\n**C. Can Toto rely on Article 7.2.b to submit claims to an ICSID tribunal?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n88.\n\nLebanon has argued that Toto was not entitled to rely on Article 7.2.b of the Treaty to submit for settlement to an ICSID tribunal the dispute related to claims which dated from before the Treaty entered into force on February 9, 2000. Indeed, Article 10 *in fine* of the Treaty indicates that it \"shall not apply to disputes that have arisen before its entry into force.\" In this context, Lebanon points out that the subject-matter of the many claims that Toto has submitted to Lebanon or its engineer between 1997 and February 9, 2000, would be excluded from the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. It refers to *Tradex v. Albania* that stated: \"[t]he term \"arise\" indicates that the beginning of the dispute is relevant and the term \"dispute\" is rather general and would usually be understood not to be restricted to a legal procedure\".27\n\n*Trades Hellas S.A. (Greece) v. Republic of Albania,* ARB 94/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, December 24, 1996, p. 188.\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n89.\n\nFor Toto, a mere claim is not a dispute. The *Clauses et Conditions G\u00e9n\u00e9rales* (\"CCG\"), Articles 50 and 51, and the *Cahier des Charges Particuli\u00e8res,* Article V.01, provided for an intricate claim system, whereby Toto, in the event it disagreed with the decision of Lebanon\u2019s engineer, had to object to the latter\u2019s position. When the engineer then replied and Toto did not agree with this reply, it had to submit a formal Memorandum to the Owner within 60 days. Then, when the Owner did not reply or did not reply satisfactorily, again within 60 days after the submission of this Memorandum, there was a dispute and Toto had to bring the claim before the appropriate jurisdiction. Mere claims are not disputes. In fact, the dispute submitted to the Tribunal arose in 2004, well after the Treaty entered into force, when it became clear that Lebanon in different ways was jeopardizing the investment and a claim had to be introduced before an ICSID arbitral tribunal.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that a mere demand is not a dispute. In the Tribunal\u2019s view the dispute arose on June 30, 2004, for the following reasons: The CCG, which are part of the Contract, distinguish between *\"difficult\u00e9s\"* or problems (Article 50) and *\"contestations\"* or disputes (Article 51). The former arise when the engineer and the contractor have different views which need to be referred for final decision to the employer/administration. The latter implies that the contractor does not agree with the position of the employer/administration. However, in the case at stake, the CDR did not take a position so that Toto invited it on June 30, 2004, to have recourse to Article 7 of the Treaty (\"Settlement of Disputes\").\n\n91.\n\nLebanon, moreover, alleges that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the present dispute under the ICSID Convention as that Convention only became applicable to Lebanon in 2003, while the Agreement was concluded in 1997 and Lebanon\u2019s general offer to submit investment disputes to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, contained in Article 7 of the Treaty, became effective in 2000 with the entry into force of the Treaty.\n\n92.\n\nHowever, a general offer from Lebanon, made in 2000, is only the preliminary step for the consent to submit a dispute to ICSID arbitration because it needs acceptance. In fact, this general offer was only accepted by Toto on June 30, 2004, when Toto informed Lebanon of its intention to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration. It was thus well after the ICSID Convention entered into force, i.e., on June 30 2004, that, by Toto\u2019s acceptance, the parties consented to submit the dispute to ICSID Arbitration.\n\n93.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is not affected by the fact that Lebanon has made the general offer to accept ICSID arbitration for investment disputes with Italian investors, well before the ICSID Convention entered into force for Lebanon. It is sufficient that Lebanon had offered to accept ICSID jurisdiction and that the ICSID Convention was in force at the time of the consent, i.e., on June 30, 2004.28\n\nSee C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2001, nos. 322 and 323, referring, *inter alia,* to *Holidays Inns* v. *Morocco,* N\u00b0 ARB 72/1, also discussed in Lalive, The First \u2018World Bank\u2019 Arbitration, 1 ICSID Reports 645.\n\n94.\n\nWith respect to Lebanon\u2019s argument that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires a written consent of the parties to submit the dispute to ICSID, the Tribunal considers that such consent has been given by Lebanon in its written offer to accept ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 7.2 of the Treaty, and by Toto pursuant to its letter of June 30, 2004 and its actual submission of the Request for Arbitration.\n\n**D. Breach of Article 2 of the Treaty: Failure to Promote and Protect the Claimant\u2019s Investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nToto argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Lebanon\u2019s failure to promote and protect its investment in breach of Article 2 of the Treaty, which provides:\n\n*1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.*\n\n*2. Each Contracting Party, in accordance with its laws and regulations, shall allow the investor to engage top managerial and technical personnel of his choice, regardless of nationality and grant the related permits.*\n\n*3. Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or liquidation of such investments. In particular, each Contracting Party or its competent authorities shall issue the necessary permits mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article.*\n\n*4. Each Contracting Party shall create and maintain, in its territory favourable economic and legal conditions in order to ensure the effective application of this Agreement.*\n\n96.\n\nToto has claimed that Lebanon, exercising its sovereign authority, has failed to protect its investment, in breach of Article 2 of the Treaty, by:\n\na. delaying the necessary expropriation required under the contract to enable the Claimant to take possession of the site;\n\nb. failing to deliver major sites due to presence of Syrian troops in the area;\n\nc. failing to protect legal possession due to problems with occupants who opposed leaving the expropriated properties;\n\nd. providing erroneous instructions, misleading information, and errors in design;\n\ne. changing the regulatory framework in which the investment was made29; and\n\nf. changing legislations after the submission of the tender.\n\nSometimes Toto refers to a \"change of the regulatory framework,\" sometimes \"changes in the legal framework\n\n**1. Delay in expropriation**\n-----------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Government of Lebanon, according to Toto, failed to carry out the required site expropriations in order to deliver the sites, a responsibility under Lebanese law of the Government in the exercise of its prerogatives. This failure adversely affected Toto\u2019s investment, in breach of Article 2 of the Treaty.\n\n98.\n\nContrary to what Lebanon alleges in its Reply, the delay to carry out the necessary expropriations is distinct from the delay to deliver the sites. The expropriation is a legal measure that can be carried out notwithstanding the factual situation of the expropriated parcels, i.e., notwithstanding the fact that the expropriated parcels are occupied by squatters or by army troops.\n\n99.\n\nToto does not claim specific compensation because of delays in expropriation. It claims a total amount of US$10,139,083.26 to cover damages suffered as a result of all the delays it faced (due to delay in expropriation, failure to protect legal possession, etc.) that were beyond its control.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n100.\n\nLebanon argues that the alleged delay to carry out the expropriations does not constitute a breach of the Treaty because it concerns the performance of the works, required under the Contract. Consequently it is a pure contractual claim and is not covered by the Treaty. Although Toto distinguishes the delay in expropriation from the failure to deliver sites. Both result in an alleged delay in the delivery of the site, a performance required from the CEGP/CDR under the Contract; it is not an act of the Government of Lebanon as State.\n\n101.\n\nThe fact that the delay in expropriation is constituent of the contractual claim for delay in delivery of the site is confirmed by the fact that Toto is not seeking specific compensation for the former but only a global compensation for the latter.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal starts from the fact that, pursuant to the applicable law and to the terms of the Contract,30 the CEGP and the CDR had committed themselves to site expropriations. Lebanon is responsible for these commitments made by an entity in the exercise of its governmental authority. In its capacity as a sovereign authority, it is moreover responsible for deciding and implementing site expropriations. The question that arises is whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction because the failure by Lebanon to carry out the required site expropriations, if established, constitutes a violation of Article 2 of the Treaty, which obliges Lebanon to create and maintain favourable economic and legal conditions that allow investors to perform their obligations and use their rights without hindrances and to protect investments and refrain from any unreasonable or discriminatory actions that would impair such investments.\n\nArticle 11.03, \u00a76 of the *Cahier des Charges Particuli\u00e8res.*\n\n103.\n\nAs a general rule, a mere non-performance of a contractual obligation does not by itself fall within the scope of the State\u2019s undertakings under the Treaty. In *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* the Tribunal stated that exceptional geological conditions *\"that concern the implementation of the Contracts, and do not involve any issue beyond the application of a contract and the conduct of the contracting parties*.\"31 In particular, these exceptional geological conditions did not result in \"unfair and inequitable treatment\" or \"unjustified or discriminatory measures.\" They moreover did not \"concern any exercise of *\"puissance publique\u2019* by the State.\"32\n\nICSID case no. ARB/03/3, Decision dated April 22, 2005, \u00a7268.\n\nICSID case no. ARB/03/3, Decision dated April 22, 2005, \u00a7268.\n\n104.\n\nA State could, as an ordinary contracting partner, have a dispute with an investor. For a breach of Article 2 of the Treaty, however, the State or its emanation has to go beyond what an ordinary contracting partner would do and act within its sovereign authority.33\n\nE. Gaillard, *\"Chronique des Sentences Arbitrates\",* JDI 2006, p. 296.\n\n105.\n\nIn Consortium *RFCC v. The Kingdom of Morocco* the Tribunal stated: \"[a] *violation can certainly result from the violation of the contract, but without a possible violation of the contract constituting, ipso jure, and in itself, a violation of the Treaty.\"*34 Moreover, the Tribunal hereby also referred to *Joy Mining Machinery v. Republic of Egypt,* which stated that \"a basic general distinction can be made between commercial aspects of a dispute and other aspects involving the existence of some form of State interference with the operation of the contract involved.\"35\n\nICSID case no. ARB/00/6, Decision dated December 22, 2003, \u00a7 48.\n\nICSID case no. ARB/03/11 - Decision on jurisdiction dated August 6, 2004, \u00a772.\n\n106.\n\nOn the contrary, when the State acts as an administrative authority, holder of the *\"puissance publique,\"* while performing obligations arising from the Contract, such State must be viewed both as a party to the contract and as a sovereign.\n\n107.\n\nThe authority to expropriate is a typical example of a prerogative that can only be exercised by the State (or by its emanation) as holder of the *\"puissance publique.\"*\n\n108.\n\nThus, clearly, in the matter at hand, expropriation by Lebanon through the CDR is a prerogative that does not pertain to the simple performance of ordinary contractual duties. It falls within the scope of the *\"puissance publique\"* that must be used to allow performance of the contract by Toto and enters within the scope of Article 2, paragraph 3 of the Treaty.\n\n109.\n\nConsequently the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction over the alleged failure by Lebanon to timely carry out the expropriations required for the performance of the works by Toto under the Contract.\n\n**2. Failures to remove Syrian troops and to protect legal possession**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n110.\n\nThe State of Lebanon also failed to free major sites - as required under the Contract -because of the presence of Syrian troops in the area. The Syrian troops, which were assisting the Lebanese State in restoring and maintaining peace and order on the Lebanese territory, were legally under the command of Lebanon.36 Consequently, the Lebanese Government was responsible for their occupation of the sites and thus for the delays and damages resulting from it.\n\nToto refers to *Makssoud v. Republic of Lebanon* (1986), which ruled that the Lebanese State is responsible for the Syrian troops present in Lebanon (CRJ, p. 14 \u00a741, Toto\u2019s exhibit RJ2: Civil judge Baabda (concerning rent matters), file n\u00b0 474/1983, judgment n\u00b0 54, dated August 7, 1986)\n\n111.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Lebanon was aware, at the time when the Contract was concluded with Toto, that Syrian troops were occupying the site so that it assumed the risk related to it.\n\n112.\n\nToto further alleges that Lebanon failed to protect access to the expropriated sites when occupants refused to leave the expropriated properties.\n\n113.\n\nAgain, Toto does not claim specific compensation due to failure to remove Syrian troops and to protect legal possession but rather claims a total amount of US$10,139,083.26 to cover damages which resulted from all the delays it faced due to late expropriations, failure to protect legal possession, etc.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n114.\n\nFor Lebanon, the delay in the delivery of sites due to Syrian troops breaches the obligation under the contract to deliver and give access to the site. The reasons for the presence of the Syrian troops at the site and for the failure to vacate do not affect the characterisation of the failure to give access to the site as a contractual claim.\n\n115.\n\nBesides, there is international consensus that Lebanon had no control over the Syrian troops at the time the works had to be performed under the Contract. Their removal by force was factually impossible and an attempt thereto could have threatened the existence of the country itself. As stated in *LG & E v. Argentina:* \"[t]/ze *stability of the legal and business framework should not pose any danger for the existence of the host state itself which could not be put at risk by meticulously respecting contractual engagements.\"37*\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp. LG&E Capital Corp., LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (hereafter *\"LG&E* v. *Argentine\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, October 3, 2006, para. 124 *in fine').*\n\n116.\n\nFor Lebanon, the alleged failure to protect legal possession is likewise related to the delay in the execution of the works and thus is \"a pure contractual claim, not covered by the Treaty.\"\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe same reasoning that applies to Lebanon\u2019s alleged failure to expropriate also applies to its alleged failure to remove Syrian troops from the site and to prevent protesters and occupants from obstructing the works. Lebanon, although concerned with these matters as a contracting party through the CEGP and the CDR, had itself to act as holder of the *\"puissance publique.\"*\n\n118.\n\nThe alleged inaction of Lebanon with respect to those two matters, if proven, would thus constitute a failure to protect investments under Article 2 of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on this matter.\n\n**3. Erroneous instructions and design**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n119.\n\nToto further claims that Lebanon failed to protect its investment by giving misleading information, wrong instructions and erroneous design. Toto requests the Tribunal to award US$3,834,454.78 for damages suffered for extra works and charges due to wrong instructions, misleading information and erroneous design.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n120.\n\nFor Lebanon, construction instructions and design are not a prerogative of *\"puissance publiquef* an error in design is a purely technical matter. The claims related to the alleged erroneous instructions and design are thus pure contract claims concerning technical issues which the Treaty obviously does not cover.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n121.\n\nToto\u2019s claims appear to relate to the standard duties in a construction contract, i.e., an alleged failure by an employer to comply with his obligations towards the contractor. It does not involve the use of sovereign authority or *\"puissance publique\"*\n\n122.\n\nConsequently, such a claim does not fall within the scope of Article 2, paragraph 3 of the Treaty. The Tribunal thus has no jurisdiction under Article 2 of the Treaty with respect to the claim of \"Erroneous Instructions and Design.\"\n\n**4. Change of the regulatory framework**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n123.\n\nLebanon introduced new legislation that changed the regulatory framework under which the Claimant had entered into the contract with the CEGP/CDR. It increased, for instance, customs duties and taxes as well as government fees on cement. These and other such changes negatively affected Toto\u2019s investment in breach of Article 2 of the Treaty.\n\n124.\n\nWhile Lebanon is certainly entitled to change the legal and regulatory framework in the public interest of the country, Toto is entitled to compensation for the losses its investment suffered due to these changes under Article 1.13 of the *Cahier des Clauses Juridiques et A dm inistratives.*\n\n125.\n\nOn this ground, Toto requests to be awarded by the Tribunal US$ 673,790.52 for damages suffered due to additional costs and charges occasioned by the changes in the regulatory framework.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n126.\n\nFor Lebanon, changes in the regulatory framework and in administrative law are remedied under the contract law concept of *\"fait du prince*,\" to which Toto itself has referred in its submission. Such reference confirms that this claim is a contractual claim.\n\n127.\n\nFurther, the new legislation applied generally and did not affect Toto in an unjustified or discriminatory manner. Besides, the alleged effect of the legislative change on the execution of the contract is rather small (US$673,790.52), compared to the total amount of the works. Consequently, Toto\u2019s argument that such changes constitute a breach under the Treaty becomes manifestly groundless.\n\n128.\n\nFinally, the Treaty does not aim at forbidding mere changes in legislation but rather at the maintenance of a favourable legal framework. Toto\u2019s claim referring to mere changes in legislation is manifestly without legal merits and should be dismissed at the jurisdictional phase.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Treaty does not sanction changes in legislation. It rather obliges Lebanon to create and maintain favorable economic and legal conditions. The Tribunal does not regard a mere increase in customs duties and taxes as *prima facie* evidence of failure to maintain \"favorable economic and legal conditions\" of the investment.\n\n130.\n\nHowever, if Toto could demonstrate that these changes in legislation were discriminatory, unreasonable, or otherwise in violation of the Treaty, the Tribunal would have jurisdiction under Article 2, paragraph 3 or other provisions of the Treaty.\n\n**E. Breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty: Lack of Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nToto argues that Lebanon failed to \"ensure fair and equitable treatment\" of its investment and thus breached Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n**1. Disruption of negotiations with the CDR regarding claims submitted between 2000 and 2002**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n132.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2002, Toto submitted various claims first to the CEGP and then, when the CEGP was replaced in 2001 by the CDR, to the latter. Some of these claims were resolved, some were not. The claims from the first years of the works were largely dealt with at the time. However several claims from the later years remained unaddressed.\n\n133.\n\nBetween October 2000 and December 2002, the following claims for additional compensation to the CEGP/CDR remained unanswered up to March 27, 2007, date of the Request for Arbitration, and beyond.\n\nClaims:\n\n(1) for changes of legislation (increase in customs duties on steel in October 2000, increase in price of diesel in June 2001, increase in government fees on cement in October 2001, increase in aggregates price in December 2002);\n\n(2) for extra works executed due to misleading information given to Toto (April 2001);\n\n(3) for loss of productivity due to landslides (August 2001);\n\n(4) for delays in expropriation and site possession as well as for additional unforeseen work and conditions (September 2002);\n\n(5) for an increase in the price of bitumen due to delays in the works (December 2002); and\n\n(6) for extra works due to third-party damages that occurred after the opening of the highway (December 2002).\n\n134.\n\nOn June 30, 2004, Toto submitted to the CDR a draft Request for Arbitration and an invitation to negotiate as provided for per Article 7.1 of the Treaty.38 In August 2004, the CDR authorised its President to conduct the negotiations. Because of a change in the Lebanese Government and in the CDR\u2019s Board of Directors, the negotiations were suspended at the end of 2004. The negotiations did not resume despite Toto\u2019s renewed invitation thereto in May 2005. Upon the request of the Italian Government, there were two or three meetings; but at the last meeting, in May 2008, it became clear that the negotiations were at a standstill.\n\nToto\u2019s letter of June 30, 2004 to the Chairman of the CDR.\n\n135.\n\nFor Toto, Lebanon\u2019s failure to seriously negotiate was *\"a clear manifestation of serious administrative negligence and inconsistency jeopardizing the investment of the Claimant....\"* The disruption of negotiations and the refusal to resume them is contrary to standards of fair and equal treatment and thus a violation of Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n136.\n\nLebanon contends that the Treaty does not require that negotiations be undertaken without disruption or that such negotiations ultimately succeed. It only requires that consultations between the parties take place, which is what happened. Thus the CDR\u2019s failure (if any) to resume the negotiations cannot be considered a breach of the Treaty.\n\n137.\n\nMoreover, there is no indication that, if the negotiations had been resumed, they would have resulted in acceptance of Toto\u2019s claims.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Treaty requires that negotiations take place between the parties, which is what happened in the present case. However, nothing in the Treaty addresses the conduct of the negotiations or requires a positive outcome. Consequently, when Toto became dissatisfied with the negotiations, it was entitled to submit its claims under the contract to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.* The Tribunal\u2019s *prima facie* review of those and other previously mentioned facts relevant to this issue lead it to decide that it has no jurisdiction under Article 3.1 of the Treaty with respect to the claim for disruption of negotiations.\n\n**2. Delay in the two lawsuits before the** ***Conseil d\u2019Etat***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n139.\n\nToto also refers to two proceedings it introduced before the Lebanese *Conseil d\u2019Etat* in August 2001 under the jurisdiction clause of Article V.01 (1) of the *Cahier des Clauses Juridiques et Administrative,* which forms part of the Contract. The first of these proceedings, which started on August 1, 2001, concerned a claim for compensation for additional \"crushed materials\" required because the soil did not meet the contractual qualifications. The second, which started on August 24, 2001, concerned a claim for compensation for unforeseen changes to the original, erroneous design.39 According to Toto, these proceedings have not progressed substantially since the end of August 2002 when the parties submitted their last briefs of reply.\n\nExhibits R24 and R25 submitted by the Respondent.\n\n140.\n\nToto emphasizes that it does not criticize the ****Conseil d\u2019Etat**** in general. However, in these two particular cases, the slow pace of the ****Conseil d\u2019Etat**** constitutes a breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty. Indeed, the proceedings began in 2001 and both parties submitted their briefs to the ****Conseil d\u2019Etat**** by the end of August 2002. The lawsuits then remained unattended for six years. No report of the Juge-Rapporteur has been issued yet. In January 2008, well after the start of the present ICSID arbitration, the ****Conseil d\u2019Etat**** requested the parties to submit copies of some documents, which Toto regards as irrelevant to the lawsuits. In fact, because the entire documents, such as the signed Contract, would be too voluminous Toto had already submitted excerpts of such documents, as is usually done.\n\n141.\n\nToto argues that Lebanon, as a State, is liable for the *Conseil d\u2019Etat\u2019* s behaviour, even if it did not intervene in its functioning. The judicial system is one of the attributes of a sovereign State for the functioning of which the State is responsible.\n\n142.\n\nIn comparison with other proceedings before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat,* the two lawsuits at issue have proceeded at an abnormally slow pace, the normal time for proceedings being one to five years. The fact that the lawsuits were not attended to for such a long period constitutes a denial of justice under international law that entails the responsibility of Lebanon.\n\n143.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the lawsuits were not attended to for such a long period also constitutes a breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty. Indeed, the obstruction of the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* proceedings is in breach of good faith, the most basic component of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n144.\n\nAlthough Lebanon is not party to the Council of Europe, Toto finally refers to the case law on due process of the European Court of Human Rights. It also refers to Article 14 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\"ICCPR\"), ratified by Lebanon, which imposes the right of every person to have an equitable trial.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n145.\n\nLebanon argues that the time required by the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* should not be compared to the swift resolution of disputes through arbitration in general, and through ICSID arbitration in particular.\n\n146.\n\nBesides, the time needed to settle a case depends on the complexity and the circumstances of each case.\n\n147.\n\nDespite the fact that Toto was well aware that proceedings before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* may extend over a number of years, it nevertheless \"knowingly and willfully\" agreed to submit the disputes to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.*\n\n148.\n\nIn fact, the delay in Toto\u2019s procedure before the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** is not abnormal: most cases extend over five years. Moreover, the two cases are advancing, as evidenced by the decisions for production of additional documents, issued by the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** in January 2008. Due process is thus being respected.\n\n149.\n\nLebanon also points out that Toto has not requested a separate or specific compensation for these claims, and that it has only submitted two claims to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat,* whereas it now submits fifteen claims before this Tribunal.\n\n150.\n\nLebanon dismisses the references made by the Claimant to the European Convention on Human Rights (\"ECHR\") and to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights as irrelevant, since Lebanon is not a member of the Council of Europe.\n\n151.\n\nLebanon reiterates that \"denial of justice entails scandalous behaviour and bad faith on the part of the court.\" Toto has offered no *prima facie* evidence for such a charge.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n152.\n\nToto does not allege that it has been treated less favourably by the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** than have Lebanese investors or investors of any third State who have submitted claims to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.* Rather, it merely alleges that the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** is malingering with regard to the two cases Toto has submitted to it.\n\n153.\n\nOnly if there is *prima facie* evidence that the court delays in the case at stake are unfair and inequitable would the Tribunal have jurisdiction under Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n154.\n\nThe Treaty sanctions not only breaches of specific Treaty provisions, such as Article 3.1, but also breaches of any rule of international law (Article 7.3). The Treaty thus covers also a denial of justice under international law.\n\n155.\n\nIt has to be conceded that international law has no strict standards to assess whether court delays are a denial of justice.\n\n156.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the failure to render justice within a reasonable period of time may constitute a breach of international customary law. In the *Fabiani* case of 1896, Fabiani, a French national wanted to enforce an arbitral award in Venezuela, but his request for an exequatur met with a long series of suspensions and appeals, culminating in the refusal of a tribunal d\u2019exception, especially selected to deal with this case, even to schedule a hearing. The sole arbitrator found that *\"upon examining the general principles of international law, denial of justice includes wrongful delays of the judicial authority in giving judgment*.\"40 The question, however, is whether in the case at hand the delay in the proceedings of the two claims before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* constitutes a denial of justice.\n\nAntoine Fabiani (n\u00b0l) (France v, Venezuela), Moore, *Arbitrations,* 4878 at 4895\n\n157.\n\nArticle 6 of the ECHR certainly covers the question to which extent lengthy court proceedings are a breach of the right to due process and to a fair and equitable trial. This matter has been extensively subject of decisions from domestic courts and from the European Court of Human Rights. However, as Lebanon is not party to the ECHR and lies outside the territorial scope of the ECHR, these decisions are not relevant in this case.\n\n158.\n\nOn the other hand, Lebanon is a party to the ICCPR, Article 14.1 which requires the right to a fair hearing:\n\n*All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of... his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law....*\n\nThe right to a fair hearing entails a number of requirements, including the requirement that the procedure before the national tribunals be conducted expeditiously.41\n\nSee Commission ICCPR (1060/2002), *Deist* v. *Austria,* A/59/40, vol. II (July 27, 2004) 283, para 11.2; Commission ICCPR (203/1986), *Munoz v. Peru,* A/44/40 (November 4, 1988) 200 at para. 11.3. Communication n\u00b0 441/1990, *Robert Casanovas* v, *France,* A/49/40 vol. II (July 19, 1994) at para. 7.3; Communication N\u00b0 238/1987, *Floresmilo Bolanos v. Ecuador,* at para. 8.4, Communication N\u00b0 207/1986, Tves *Morael v. France,* at para. 9.3.\n\n159.\n\nUnder the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, a State may accept that individual persons file a complaint against the State before the ICCPR Commission, which then gives its opinion. However, Lebanon has not ratified this Protocol and thus cannot be summoned before the Commission. Nevertheless, the decisions of the Commission are relevant to interpret the scope of Article 14 of the ICCPR.\n\n160.\n\nTo assess whether court delays are in breach of the requirement of a fair hearing, the ICCPR Commission takes into account the complexity of the matter, whether the Claimants availed themselves of the possibilities of accelerating the proceedings, and whether the Claimants suffered from the delay. The ICCPR Commission thus decided that a two-and-a-half-year delay in the proceedings to annul an administrative order was acceptable.42 Likewise, a two-year period to obtain a judgment from an administrative tribunal against a dismissal was equally acceptable.43 On the other hand, a delay of seven years to obtain a judgment for someone who asked to be reinstated in his position and an additional delay of two-and-a-half years to get this judgment implemented was considered unacceptable.44 Likewise, eleven years of proceedings to obtain a final judgment regarding custody of and access to the claimant\u2019s children was unreasonable.45\n\nCommission ICCPR *Deisl v. Austria,* A/59/40, vol. II (July 27, 2004) 283, para 11.2.\n\nCommunication N\u00b0 441/1990, *Robert Casanovas v. France,* A/49/40 vol.

CCPR Commentary\" (2nd revised edition), 322-323: \"In *Fei* v. *Columbia,* the Committee stressed that \"the very nature of custody proceedings or proceedings concerning access of a divorced parent to his children requires that the issues complained of be adjudicated expeditiously,\"\n\n161.\n\nLebanon has argued that, when concluding the Contract, Toto was aware of the length of procedures before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.* The Tribunal is not impressed by this argument. Toto did not find itself in a bargaining position to refuse the jurisdiction of the Lebanese domestic courts. It is the obligation of Lebanon to make sure that its domestic courts function fairly and equitably, as required especially by Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n162.\n\nLebanon also has invoked overcharged dockets to justify the delay. Although overcharged dockets may explain the fact that a decision in a civil matter was not rendered within a reasonable time, it does not excuse the delay.46\n\nAnglo-Mexican Claims Commission, *El Oro Mining and Railway Co.,* quoted in Paulsson, Denial of Justice in International Law, 2007, p. 178.\n\n163.\n\nIn fact, whether justice is rendered within a reasonable delay depends on the circumstances and the context of the case.47 Each lawsuit must be analyzed individually with regard to:\n\n- the need for celerity of decision;49\n\n- the complexity of the matter\u201948\n\n- the diligence of claimant in prosecuting its case.50\n\n*Chevron-Texaco v. Ecuador,* Nr. 113\n\nTo decide whether the delay was unreasonable, *i.e.,* the complexity of the matter, the conduct of the parties in the course of the proceedings as well as the specific legitimate interest in celerity have to be evaluated.\n\nThe French *Conseil d\u2019Etat* has decided that ECHR Article 6.1 and 13 were violated when a lower administrative court took seven and a half years to rule on \"a request which did not present any particular difficulty.\"\n\nEcuador alleged that Chevron had knowingly allowed the BIT breach to occur through their deliberate lack of diligence in prosecuting their Ecuadorean court cases. The Claimants have countered with evidence that they prosecuted their cases to the point where a decision could be rendered and with an argument that doing any more would have been futile. *(Chevron-Texaco* v. *Ecuador,* Nr. 145). In fact, the Claimants have done everything they could to advance proceedings. Ecuador indicated that they could have raised a number of procedural remedies. This will be decided in the merits phase *(Chevron-Texaco v. Ecuador,* Nr. 238).\n\n164.\n\nMoreover, a state can only be held liable for denial of justice when it has not remedied this denial domestically. As summarized by Jan Paulsson:\n\n*States are held to an obligation to provide a fair and efficient system of justice, not to an undertaking that there will never be an instance of judicial misconduct. National responsibility for denial of justice occurs only when the system as a whole has been tested and the initial delict has remained uncorrected... The very definition of denial of justice encompasses the notion of exhaustion of local remedies. There can be no denial of justice before exhaustion.51*\n\nJan Paulsson, Denial of justice in International Law, 2007, p. 245-246.\n\n165.\n\nIt has to be admitted that in the present case there was indeed a very long delay between the closing of the debates in the two proceedings before the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** in 2002 and the request by the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** for submission of documents on 16 January 2008. In the eyes of the Tribunal, this in itself, however, does not constitute a breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty. In February 2005, Lebanon\u2019s former Prime Minister, Rafic Hariri, was assassinated. This was followed by several terrorist bombings and assassinations that disrupted normal life in Lebanon. In summer 2006, a destructive war took place between Lebanon and Israel. In Mid-2007 there was severe internal fighting between the organization Fatah al-Islam and the Lebanese Army. In May 2008, another internal armed conflict exploded following a 17-month-long political crisis. These circumstances undoubtedly were not conductive to the functioning of Lebanon\u2019s judicial system and affected the proper functioning of Lebanese courts between 2002 and 2008.\n\n166.\n\nIn fact, as Lebanon points out, the two cases are presently advancing, as evidenced by the two decisions for document production from the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* issued in January 2008.\n\n167.\n\nMore importantly, the Tribunal has not seen evidence that Toto made use of local remedies to speed up the proceedings before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.52* Toto had the right to consult the case files at the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** (Article 82 of the Law regulating the *Conseil d\u2019Etat).* It could have shown diligence - but did not do so - and request the **Conseil d\u2019Etat** to issue its report on the ease or review the matter quickly. Lebanon cannot be blamed for its practice not to disclose the name of the Juge-Rapporteur to prevent direct contact between the parties and the Juge-Rapporteur. Nor did non-disclosure prevent Toto from using its right to submit a written request to the President of the *Conseil d\u2019Etat\u2019* s Chamber to cause prompt issuance of the decision of the Juge-Rapporteur.\n\nIn the absence of a specific regulated remedy in the law with respect to denial of justice in administrative courts, reference must be made to the Code of Civil Procedure (\"CPC\") that, pursuant to Article 6 CPC, is the general procedural law, Article 4 CPC defines \"denial of justice\": these provisions should apply to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* given that its governing law is silent in this regard.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal has therefore not seen *prima facie* evidence that Toto itself has made use of the local remedies to shorten the procedural delays. In the absence of such evidence the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under Article 3.1 of the Treaty to decide whether the delays before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat were* unfair and inequitable.\n\n**3. Lack of Transparency in the two lawsuits before the** ***Conseil d\u2019Etat***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n169.\n\nToto further argues that, since it has been unable to obtain information regarding the progress of the procedures before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* or to learn the name of the Magistrate in charge of the file, these two procedures are contrary to the fundamental right to transparency, another breach of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard contained in Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n170.\n\nAccording to Toto, transparency is a basic requirement in any judicial system. Toto refers in this context to *LG & E Energy Corp. v. Argentine Republic* and to *Tecmed v. The United* *Mexican States,* which decided that the host State must \"act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor....\"53\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp. LG&E Capital Corp., LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (hereafter *\"LG&E* v. *Argentine\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, October 3, 2006, p. 235, para. 127; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A.* v. *The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/02, Award, May 29, 2003, para. 154.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n171.\n\nLebanon maintains that the procedures before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* do not lack transparency and denies that a claimant is entitled to know the name of the Juge-Rapporteur in charge of submitting a report to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.*\n\n172.\n\nBesides, Toto apparently was nevertheless informed about the progress of the lawsuits, since it is aware that the file has been remitted to a Magistrate of the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.*\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n173.\n\nOn the basis of the facts submitted, the Tribunal does not find a *prima facie* lack of transparency in the proceedings before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* that would give it jurisdiction to decide whether these facts amount to a breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n**4. Other claims**\n-------------------\n\n174.\n\nToto has brought forward other claims with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 3.1 of the Treaty such as the claim related to the failure to expropriate, the failure to remove Syrian troops and to protect legal possession, the claim related to erroneous instructions and design and the claim for the changes in its regulatory framework. Lebanon has raised objections to Toto\u2019s arguments.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms that erroneous instructions and design appear related to the standard duty in a construction contract, not involving use of sovereign authority or *\"puissance publique.\"* No sufficient *prima facie* evidence has been submitted to grant the Tribunal jurisdiction to decide whether they involve a breach of fair and equitable treatment as required under Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\nAs for the failure to expropriate, the failure to remove Syrian troops and to protect legal possession, the changes in the regulatory framework, which -as already discussed- there is *prima facie* evidence that they may fall under the protection of Article 2.1 of the Treaty and under Article 3.1 of the Treaty if proven to be unfair and inequitable. Consequently the Tribunal has jurisdiction over such matters.\n\n**F. Breach of Article 4.2 Treaty: Indirect Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n176.\n\nToto argues that the manner Lebanon acted can be considered as an indirect expropriation of Toto\u2019s investment, in violation of Article 4.2 of the Treaty, which assimilates \"measures having the same nature or the same effect against investments\" to expropriation and reads as follows:\n\n*Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, de jure or de facto, measures of expropriation, nationalisation or any other measures having the same nature or the same effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest as established by law, on a non-discriminatory basis, under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation, according to the enforced national law without any kind of discrimination.*\n\n177.\n\nIn addition Toto refers to paragraph 3 of the Protocol attached to the Treaty, which states with reference to Article 4.2:\n\n*Any measure undertaken by one of the Contracting Parties relating to an investment made by an investor of the other Contracting Party, which shall substantially diminish the value of the assets or create major obstacles to the activities or substantial prejudice to the value of the same asset as well as any other measure referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4.*\n\n178.\n\nAccording to Toto, it invested, in addition to the US$ 40 million that was the final value of the Project, an amount equivalent to US$ 15 million for costs and charges incurred due to acts or omissions of Lebanon and for which Toto was not reimbursed. The fact that Toto had to invest an extra amount of US$ 15 million, i.e., 37% of the Project\u2019s total amount, that was not provided for in the Contract, *\"substantially deprives the investment of economic value and is to be considered as an indirect expropriation as per Article 4.2 of the Treaty.\"*\n\n179.\n\nMoreover, the original duration of the Project was foreseen to be 18 months, but its completion took more than five years by Lebanon\u2019s fault. In Toto\u2019s view:\n\n*By extending the time for completion, because of acts and measures adopted by the Respondent in addition to changing the institutional framework by decisions adopted by the Respondent through increasing taxes, closing quarries and other similar measures, the Respondent eroded the Claimant\u2019s profits and deprived the investment of economical values which is equivalent to an indirect expropriation and constitutes breach of Article 4.2 of the Treaty54*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. 24, para. 5.3.3.\n\n180.\n\nFor Toto, the fact that its two claims, submitted to the Lebanese *Conseil d\u2019Etat,* have remained unsettled to this day and that the claims submitted to the CDR since 2001 have not only remained unsettled, but also unanswered, constitutes a further indirect expropriation.\n\n*Lebanon's Position*\n--------------------\n\n181.\n\nLebanon considers Toto\u2019s contention to be unfounded. Its claims for an amount of USS 15 million for alleged additional costs and charges resulting from the performance of the contract were disputed and are still disputed as of today. The mere non-payment of a disputed amount cannot be considered as an indirect expropriation which takes away the claim. Lebanon referred in this context to the award in *SGS v. The Republic of Philippines,* where the Tribunal reasoned that *\"whatever debt the Philippines may owe to SGS [the investor] still exists, whatever right to interest for late payment SGS had, it still has.\"55* As long as the Philippines had not enacted a statute or decree to expropriate or annul the debt or otherwise attempted to expropriate, the debt continued to exist. Given that Toto\u2019s claims are based on a mere refusal to pay and not on an allegation that the debt was in one way or another annulled by Lebanon, Toto\u2019s alleged breach of non-payment cannot constitute an indirect expropriation under the Treaty.\n\nICSID Case n\u00b0 ARB/02/6, SGS v. *Philippines,* para. 161.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n182.\n\nTo assess expropriation, the effect of the disputed measures on the investment is more important than the presence of a formal expropriation decree or the government\u2019s intention behind these measures,56 which is no constitutive requirement for indirect expropriation.57 Although an indirect and de facto expropriation does not transfer the title to property, it may have the same consequences as a formal expropriation.58 For the Tribunal in *Metalclad,* an expropriation could also be :\n\n*Covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.59*\n\n*Tippets, Abett, McCarthy, Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA Consulting Engineers of Iran, The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran* 6 Iran-USCTR 219, 225.\n\n*Siemens v. Argentina,* Award, February 6, 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8,\n\n*Petrobart Ltd v. The Kyrgyz Republic* (Award) SCC Arg 126/2003 (SCC/ECT, 2005, Danelius P, Bring & Smets).\n\n*Metalclad Corp v. Mexico* (Award) August 30, 2000, 5 ICSID Rep (2002) 457, para. 103.\n\n183.\n\nIn order to be considered as an (indirect) expropriation, the government measures need to \"effectively neutralize\" the enjoyment of property.\"60 The measures should result in *\"substantial effects of an intensity that reduces and/or removes the legitimate benefits [...] to an extent that they render their further possession useless.\"61* As was decided in *National Grid* v. *Argentina,* an expropriation requires a radical deprivation.62 Although the provision of the Treaty covers also measures of the same effect and nature as a formal expropriation, it does not lower the relevance of the effect to qualify measures as *de facto* expropriation.\n\n*CMS* v. *Argentina,* Award, May 12, 2005, 44 ILM (2005) 1205, para. 262, referring to the same wording in *Lauder v. Czech Republic,* Award, September 3, 2001, UNCITRAL (United States/ Czech Republic BIT) para. 200.\n\n*RFCCv. Morocco,* Award, December 22, 2003, 20 ICSID Rev-FILJ (2005) 391, para. 69.\n\n*National Grid P.L.C. v. Argentina* (UNCITRAL),November 3, 2008, published *in extenso* on the website of the American Society of International Law, http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/NGvArgentina.pdf.\n\n184.\n\nFor Toto, the additional costs, representing 37% of the total value of the investment, lead to a deprivation of economic value and constitute an indirect expropriation. However, this 37% is based solely on Toto\u2019s calculations. Moreover, no *prima facie* evidence has been submitted that the activities and their remuneration, initially foreseen by Toto, were an adequate performance of Toto\u2019s contractual obligations and adequately covered the risk Toto had assumed, so that no additional works and costs were required to fulfill Toto\u2019s contractual obligations. Consequently, because the Tribunal is of the opinion that Toto has not offered *prima facie* proof that uncovered costs in the amount of 37% of the value of the project may constitute a deprivation of its rights on the investment, or a measure having the same effect, it has no jurisdiction to assess such facts under Article 4.2 of the Treaty.\n\n185.\n\nFurthermore, even if Lebanon would have to pay additional costs for an amount up to 37% of the initial contract price and has failed to do so, this does not constitute an indirect expropriation, but a mere breach of contract. For the Tribunal, an indirect expropriation fundamentally requires a taking of property. As the Tribunal in *Waste Management* correctly stated: \"an enterprise is not expropriated just because its debts are not paid or other contractual obligations are breached.\"63 Referring to the authority\u2019s failure to make available land promised for the investment project, the arbitrators concluded: \"a failure by a State to provide its own land to an enterprise for some purpose is not converted into an expropriation of the enterprise just because the failure involves a breach of contract.\"64 Along similar lines, the *Azurix* Tribunal held that \"contractual breaches by a State party or one of is instrumentalities would not normally constitute expropriation.\"65 Further, relevant to the extent Toto\u2019s claims are based on regulatory changes made by Lebanon, the *Feldman v. Mexico* award held with regard to Article 1110 of the NAFTA Agreement that \"not all regulatory activity that makes it difficult or impossible for an investor to carry out a particular business, change in the law or change in the application of existing laws that makes it uneconomical to continue a particular business, is an expropriation.\"66\n\n*Waste Management Inc v. United Mexican States* (2004) 43 ILM 967, (NAFTA/ICSID (AF)), 2004, Crawford P, Civiletti & Magallon Gomez) 995, 999, para. 160.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 159.\n\n*Azurix Corp.* v. *Argentine Republic* (Award) ICSID Case ARB/01/12 (ICSID, 2006, Rigo Sureda A, Lalonde & Martins).\n\n*Feldman v. Mexico* 7 ICSID Rep 341, 370 (NAFTA/ICSID (AF), 2002, Kerameus K, Covarrubias Bravo & Gantz),\n\n186.\n\nAfter having given due consideration to all the arguments brought forward by the parties, the Tribunal concludes that in this case it has no jurisdiction under Article 4.2 of the Treaty.\n\n**G. Breach of Article 9.2 of the Treaty: Failure to Observe Obligations**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n187.\n\nToto claims that the Tribunal moreover has jurisdiction over what it considers to be Lebanon\u2019s breaches of Article 9.2 of the Treaty, i.e., the \"observance of obligations\" clause, which states: \"[e]azch *Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.\"* Article 9.2 is commonly called an \"umbrella clause\" as it may provide an \"umbrella\" to cover all obligations and bring them within the ambit of the treaty-protection.\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n188.\n\nLebanon submits that in the presence of an agreed contractual forum selection clause, the \"observance of obligation clause\" (Article 9.2 of the Treaty) does not elevate contract claims to treaty claims falling within the jurisdiction of ICSID,\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe question that arises for this Tribunal, then, is what actions and/or omissions of Lebanon, if any, could constitute a violation of Article 9.2 and therefore fall within the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal will address this question keeping in mind that it already has determined that the CEPG and the CDR are considered to be public entities of the Republic of Lebanon *(\"personnes morales de droit public\").* Indeed, it is only when Lebanon can be held liable for acts of the CEPG and the CDR, that the question becomes relevant.\n\n191.\n\nBesides the specific commitments, contained in Articles 2 to 5 of the Treaty, in Article 9.2 of the Treaty, Lebanon has undertaken to *\"observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.\"* Lebanon has thus undoubtedly assumed all its obligations as a sovereign authority under international law. However, does Article 9.2 also imply that the Treaty obliges Lebanon to observe any and all obligations it has assumed with regard to Toto\u2019s investments in its territory, whatever their nature, including also ordinary contractual obligations assumed by the CEPG and the CDR?\n\n192.\n\nTo respond to such question, and determine the intent of the parties with respect to the scope of Article 9.2, it is relevant to review the standard wording of similar umbrella clauses in other investment treaties and to consider their interpretation by other Tribunals.\n\n193.\n\nIn some instances, it can be inferred from the wording of the umbrella clause that it encompasses obligations arising from the Treaty as well as obligations arising from the contract. The Tribunal in *S.G.S v. Philippines* had to interpret the following umbrella clause from the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Philippines and the United Kingdom: *\"[e]ach party shall observe any obligation arising from a particular commitment it may have entered into with regards to specific investment.\"* (Article VII)\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the parties\u2019 intent to cover all their contractual obligations, including ordinary contractual obligations that do not involve any use of *\"puissance publique\"* transpired from the wording of the contract, and particularly from the use of the terms \"particular commitment\" and \"specific investment.\" Consequently it held that it had jurisdiction with respect to contractual obligations by stating:67 *\"To summarize the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on this point, Article X(2) makes it a breach of the BIT for the host state to fail to observe binding commitments including contractual commitments, which it has assumed with regard to specific investments [...]\"*\n\nICSID case no. ARB/02/6, Decision on jurisdiction dated January 29, 2004, paragraph 128.\n\n195.\n\nOther umbrella clauses were drafted in more general terms and leave room for interpretation. For instance, the Investment Treaty between the United Kingdom and Peru states: *\"[e]ach contracting party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other contracting party.\"* (Article 3(1)). This clause is only slightly different in terms from Article 9.2 of the Investment Treaty between Lebanon and Italy: *\"[e]ach Contracting party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regards to investments in his territory by investors of other Contracting Party.\"*\n\n196.\n\nThese clauses, which must be interpreted in accordance with the objectives sought by the parties in line with the customary rules of interpretation of treaties in public international law, have been interpreted in different ways.\n\n197.\n\nOne interpretation held that such clauses are operative only when the parties have clearly expressed their intent to consider breaches of contract as breaches of the Treaty. This was the case of the Tribunal in *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan.68* The Tribunal had to interpret the umbrella clause in the Investment Treaty between Switzerland and Pakistan that states: *\"[e]ither contracting party shall constantly guarantee the observance of commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the contracting party\"* (Article 11). The Tribunal stated first its canon for interpretation: *\"A Treaty interpreter must of course seek to give effect to the object and purpose projected by that Article and by the BIT as a whole. That object and purpose must be ascertained, in the first instance, from the text itself of Article 11 and the rest of the BIT.\"* It found:\n\n*[a]pplying these familiar norms of customary international law on Treaty interpretation, we do not find a convincing basis for accepting the Claimant\u2019s contention that Article 11 of the BIT has had the effect of entitling a Contracting Party\u2019s investor, like SGS, in the face of a valid forum selection contract clause, to \"elevate\" its claims grounded solely in a contract with another Contracting Party, like the PSI Agreement, to claims grounded on the Treaty, and accordingly to bring such contract claims to this Tribunal for resolution and decision.69*\n\nBecause no evidence was submitted that the contracting parties intended to extend the scope of application of the umbrella clause, the Tribunal asserted that the clause was restricted to the liability of the State in pursuance of the substantial provisions of the Investment Treaty and could not be extended to the liability ensued from the contract.\n\nICSID case no. ARB/01/13, Decision dated August 6, 2003 on jurisdiction.\n\nParagraph no. 165 of the Decision.\n\n198.\n\nOther Tribunals limited the protection of umbrella clauses to actions taken by the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority. This was the case of the decision of *El Paso Energy* *International Company v. Argentina,70* that has categorically confirmed that the umbrella clause, even if drafted as broadly as possible, will only confer jurisdiction to the Tribunal on the basis of the Treaty when the State is acting in its capacity as a sovereign authority.\n\nICSID case no. ARB/03/15, Decision on jurisdiction dated April 27, 2006.\n\n199.\n\nA third view considers that umbrella clauses transform all contractual claims into treaty claims. This was the case of the Decision in *Noble Ventures Inc. v. Romania*.71\n\nICSID Case no. ARB/01/11, dated October 12, 2005,paras 46-62.\n\n200.\n\nA fourth view held that umbrella clauses may form the basis for treaty claims, without transforming contractual claims into treaty claims. Such view is described by Professor James Crawford who states\n\n*Finally, there is the view that an umbrella clause is operative and may form the basis for a substantive treaty claim, but that it does not convert a contractual claim into a treaty claim. On the one hand it provides, or at least may provide, a basis for a treaty claim even if the BIT in question contains not generic claims clause; on the other hand, the umbrella clause does not change the proper law of the contract or its legal incidents, including provisions for dispute settlement.72*\n\n*\"Treaty and Contract in investment Arbitration\",* Arbitration International, Vol. 24, no. 3 (2008), pp. 351-374.\n\n201.\n\nTaking into consideration the spirit and purpose of the Treaty in the matter at hand, the Tribunal espouses the fourth view. That view best conforms with the unqualified commitment assumed by Lebanon to comply with \"any other obligation it has assumed\" as well as with the fourth paragraph of the Preamble to the Treaty which confirms the importance of the \"contractual protection\" of investments - again without further qualification. Moreover, when the Treaty provides for submission of disputes to Lebanese courts in its Article 7.2.a, these national courts in any event will decide the dispute in accordance with national contract law. Article 7 does not provide for the application of international law by national courts as it does for the two other options: for claims submitted to ICSID arbitration (Article 7.2.b indirectly by referring to the ICSID Convention Article 41 of which is considered to provide for the application of international law; and for claims submitted to an *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal, directly by Article 7.3 of the Treaty).\n\n202.\n\nAlthough Article 9.2 of the Treaty may be used as a mechanism for the enforcement of claims, it does not elevate pure contractual claims into treaty claims. The contractual claims remain based upon the contract; they are governed by the law of the contract and may be affected by the other provisions of the contract. In the case at hand that implies that they remain subject to the contractual jurisdiction clause and have to be submitted exclusively to the Lebanese courts for settlement. Because of this jurisdiction clause in favor of Lebanese courts, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the contractual claims arising from the contract referring disputes to Lebanese courts. As in the case of *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan73* the Tribunal does not see a reason in the case at hand and\n\n*in the face of a valid forum selection contract clause, to \"elevate \" its claims grounded solely in a contract with another Contracting Party... to claims grounded on the Treaty, and accordingly to bring such contract claims to this Tribunal for resolution and decision.74*\n\nICSID case no. ARB/01/13, Decision dated August 6, 2003 on jurisdiction.\n\nParagraph no. 165 of the Decision.\n\n**H. The Fork in the Road - Contractual Claims**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Treaty includes a so-called \"fork-in-the-road\" clause in Article 7.2:\n\n*If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of written request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute, at his choice, for settlement to:*\n\n*(a) the competent court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made; or*\n\n*(b) the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) provided for by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of the other States, opened for signature at Washington, on March 18, 1965, in case both Contracting Parties have become members of this Convention; or*\n\n*(c) an ad hoc tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties to the dispute, shall be established under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission of International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).*\n\n*The choice made as per subparagraphs a, b, and c herein above is final.*\n\n204.\n\nThe Contract between the CEPG and Toto includes in Article V.01, paragraph 2 of the *Cahier des Charges Particuli\u00e8res - Cahier des Clauses Juridiques et Administrative,* the following dispute resolution clause: \"[l]es *tribunaux libanais sont seuls comp\u00e9tents pour r\u00e9gler les litiges au cours de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019adjudication ou en application du cahier des charges.\"*\n\nOn the basis of such jurisdiction clause, Toto has initiated two different proceedings before the Lebanese *Conseil d\u2019Etat.*\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n205.\n\nLebanon argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims already submitted to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* because Article 7.2 of the Treaty gives the Claimant the option of submitting claims either to the host State\u2019s domestic courts *(in casu Conseil d\u2019Etat)* or to international arbitration (ICSID), but not to both. Even assuming *arguendo* that these claims amount to Treaty claims (which Lebanon firmly rejects, considering them to be purely contractual in nature), the fork-in-the-road clause would bar Toto from submitting these Treaty claims to ICSID.\n\n206.\n\nFor Lebanon, the claims submitted to both the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* and ICSID have the same aim of obtaining compensation for extra costs incurred in the execution of the Contract. If the Tribunal were to decide that it has jurisdiction to hear this case, the parallel proceedings could result in \"conflicting, contradictory and more importantly, unenforceable decisions.\"\n\n207.\n\nIt would be \"unreasonable\" and \"against the wording and spirit\" of Article 7.2 of the Treaty to allow Toto to submit some of its claims to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* and some to ICSID. The fork-in-the-road principle, i.e., *\"electa una via, non datur recursus ad alteram,\"* belongs to the essence of the Treaty. Some ICSID awards have considered the principle as reflecting a public policy of the host State.\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n208.\n\nFor Toto, the claims brought before the Tribunal are different from those brought before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat:* the cases pending before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* relate to breaches of the Contract, while the claims submitted before the Tribunal relate to breaches of the Treaty. The prejudice suffered because of the alleged breach of the Treaty is of a different nature and goes far beyond the two cases submitted to the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.* As stated in *CMS v. Argentina: \"as contractual claims are different from Treaty claims, even if there had been or there currently was a recourse to the local courts from breach of contract, this would not have prevented submissions of the Treaty claims to arbitration.\"75*\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Republic of Argentina* (Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003, 42 ILM 800, para. 80. This case is quoted in *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 December 2003, para. 89.\n\n209.\n\nThe fork-in-the-road clause of Article 7 can only bar submission of Treaty claims to an international forum if those claims have already been submitted to the domestic courts. In the present proceeding, Toto chose \"without any hesitation\" to submit its Treaty claims (failure to protect its investment and denial of justice) to an ICSID arbitration tribunal and it clearly stated its intention to do so in its letter to the Chairman of the CDR of June 30, 2004.\n\n210.\n\nToto\u2019s position is supported by *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. Argentine Republic* and by **Vivendi** v. *Argentine Republic.* Moreover, as Panels in *M.C.I. Power Group L.G. and New Turbine v. Ecuador* and **Vivendi** v. *Argentine Republic* indicated: *\"having recourse to a domestic forum for breaches of contract does not involve exercising the right to. choose an alternative under the BIT, unless the claim in the domestic forum is based on breach of the BIT.\"*\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe fork-in-the road clause in Article 7 of the Treaty does not take away jurisdiction from the Tribunal over Treaty claims. In order for a fork-in-the-road clause to preclude claims from being considered by the Tribunal, the Tribunal has to consider whether the same claim is \"on a different road,\" i.e., that a claim with the same object, parties and cause of action, is already brought before a different judicial forum. Contractual claims arising out of the Contract do not have the same cause of action as Treaty claims.\n\n212.\n\nConsequently, the fact that Toto has brought two contract claims before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* does not restrict Toto\u2019s right to submit its Treaty claims to the Tribunal. This Tribunal hereby refers to *CMS* v. *Argentine,* also cited by Toto and to *Genin* v. *Estonia,* in which the Tribunal concluded: *\"[a]lthough certain aspects of the facts that gave rise to this dispute were also at issue in the Estonian litigation, the \u2018investment dispute \u2019 itself was not, and the Claimant should not therefore be banned from using the ICSID arbitration mechanism.\"76*\n\n*Genin Eastern Credit Ltd. and AS Baltoil v. Republic of Estonia* (Award), 2001, 6 ICSID Rep 236,292.\n\n**I. Fork in the Road-Treaty Claims**\n-------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nMoreover the contractual jurisdiction clause, which has given rise to the proceedings before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat,* cannot exclude the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for claims based upon Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Treaty (see, e.g. *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco;777 SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan.78* As the ad hoc Committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina* has stated clearly:\n\n*Where \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" is a Treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the Treaty standard. At most, it might be relevant - as municipal law will often be relevant - in assessing whether there has been a breach of the Treaty.79*\n\nICSID case no. ARB/00/04, Decision dated 23 July 2001, para. 27.\n\nICSID case no. ARB/01/13, Decision dated August 6, 2003 on jurisdiction, para. 54.\n\nICSID case no. ARB/97/3, Decision dated July 3, 2002, para. 101..\n\n214.\n\nThe contractual jurisdiction clause and the Treaty jurisdiction clause are not mutually exclusive clauses. The contractual jurisdiction clause provided for in the Contract applies to actions and matters that are violations of the Contract; the Treaty jurisdiction clause applies to actions and matters that constitute violations of the substantive Treaty provisions even if the same actions and matters may give rise to breach of contract.80 It must also be noted that contractual claims founded on the investment contract do not have the same cause of action as the Treaty claims.\n\nIbrahim Fadlallah comments in \"La *distinction \u00ab Treaty claims........contract claims \u00bb et la comp\u00e9tence de l\u2019arbitre* *Cirdi: faisons nous fausse route ?* \u00bb, Chronique Arbitrage et Investissements Internationaux - Gazette du Palais, December 5 to 7, 2004, p. 3612, *et seq.,as* follows:\n\n*\u00ab Il- La concurrence d\u2019une clause attributive de juridiction dans le contrat :*\n\n*Lorsque le contrat pr\u00e9voit une clause attributive de juridiction \u00e0 un arbitre \u00e9tranger au Cirdi ou aux tribunaux \u00e9tatiques, la jurisprudence dominante donne effet \u00e0 cette clause au d\u00e9triment de l\u2019arbitre Cirdi. Mais elle limite la comp\u00e9tence du juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 aux litiges purement contractuels \u00bb.*\n\nIt is in that sense that the Tribunal gave in *Joy Mining Machinery v. Egypt* ICSID ARB/03/11) full effect to the contractual jurisdiction clause for a dispute concerning an ordinary contractual obligation (performance bond) when there is no violation of the Treaty.\n\n215.\n\nWhen the State acts in the context of the performance of the contract as a *\"puissance publique\"* a violation of the Contract would also constitute a violation of the Treaty, and the Tribunal will have jurisdiction for disputes arising from such violations. When the State acts as an ordinary employer, the contractual jurisdiction clause will be fully operative, and the Tribunal will have no jurisdiction.\n\n216.\n\nIn *SGS v. Pakistan,* the Tribunal, having examined the effect of a dispute resolution clause, stated:\n\n*from that description alone [of the factual subject matter], without more, we believe that no implication necessarily arises that both BIT and purely contractual claims are intended to be covered by the Contracting Parties in Article 9 [the dispute resolution clause].* *Neither, accordingly, does an implication arise that the Article 9 dispute settlement mechanism would supersede and set at naught all otherwise valid non-ICSID forum selection clauses in all earlier agreements [...] thus we do not see anything in Article 9 or in any other provision of the BIT that can be read as vesting this Tribunal with jurisdiction over claims resting ex hypothesi exclusively on contract.81*\n\nICSID case no. ARB/01/13, Decision dated August 6, 2003 on jurisdiction, para no, 161.\n\n217.\n\nBased on the foregoing, it can be said that the Contract\u2019s jurisdiction clause does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Treaty claims since the Contract\u2019s jurisdiction clause covers only contractual matters and does not extend to Treaty matters. In the presence of a contractual jurisdiction clause, the Tribunal will not have jurisdiction with respect to claims for actions that are only contract violations and are not at the same time Treaty violations. However, when such actions are breaches of the contract and also violations of the Treaty, the Tribunal will have jurisdiction notwithstanding the Contract\u2019s jurisdiction clause.\n\n**J. Stay of Proceedings.**\n---------------------------\n\n*Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n218.\n\nLebanon finally has argued - with reference to *SGS* v. *Philippines,* that the Tribunal should in all events stay its proceedings to allow the *Conseil d\u2019Etat,* the jurisdiction chosen in the Contract, to decide on disputes about the breaches of contract.\n\n*Toto\u2019s Position*\n-----------------\n\n219.\n\nToto requested the Tribunal not to stay the proceedings as these proceedings concern breaches of the Treaty and not of the Contract.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n---------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal deems it improper to stay its proceedings, which only concern breaches of the Treaty. It has indicated that it will not deal with the specific facts underlying the two claims submitted before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.* Besides, as no other contractual claims have presently been introduced, the settlement of these claims, if ever introduced before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat,* could take a substantial period of time. Even for mere reasons of expediency, the Tribunal cannot suspend its proceedings for such a substantial period waiting for judgments which, although indirectly related to some facts which are also the basis of Treaty claims before this Tribunal, have a completely different scope and cause of action. In the event the Lebanese *Conseil d\u2019Etat* will have to decide on the contract claims at a later moment, the Tribunal expects that the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* will take into account this Tribunal\u2019s decision with regard to the Treaty claims, whenever this would be appropriate.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\nIN VIEW OF THE ABOVE, THE TRIBUNAL HEREBY DECIDES AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1) The *Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif des Grands Projets* and the *Council for Reconstruction and Development* are public legal entities whose actions are attributable to the Republic of Lebanon;\n\n2) Toto\u2019s project meets the requirements to be considered as an \"investment\" under the Treaty as well as under the ICSID Convention;\n\n3) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute *ratione temporis* under Article 7.2.b and Article 10 of the Treaty as the dispute has arisen on June 30, 2004, i.e., after the Treaty entered into force;\n\n4) The Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute pursuant to the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the Treaty rules;\n\n5) Subject to the Tribunal\u2019s considerations, stated above, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide whether (i) the delay in expropriation, (ii) the failure to remove Syrian troops and (iii) the changes in the regulatory framework, constitute breaches of Article 2 and/or Article 3.1 of the Treaty;\n\n6) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to the following claims:\n\na) Erroneous Instructions and Design as breaches of Article 2 and Article 3.1 of the Treaty;\n\nb) Disruption of negotiations as breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty;\n\nc) Delays in two law suits before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* as breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty;\n\nd) Lack of Transparency in the proceedings before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* as breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty; and\n\ne) Indirect expropriation as breach of Article 4.2 of the Treaty.\n\n7) With regard to Article 9.2 of the Treaty, and in the presence of a jurisdiction clause in the Contract, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to breaches to the extent they are violations of the Contract;\n\n8) The Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide over breaches of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Treaty, its jurisdiction thereover not being affected by Article 7.2 of the Treaty; and\n\n9) The Tribunal deems it improper to stay the proceedings because of the proceedings already pending before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* as the Tribunal will not deal with matters covered by these proceedings.\n\n10) The decision of the Tribunal with respect to the party who will bear the legal costs and the costs and expenses of the arbitration, and in what proportion, will be included in the final award."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2012-06-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Concurring Opinion of Judge Schwebel (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Concurring Opinion of Judge Schwebel (Award)\n--------------------------------------------\n\nI was appointed as a member of this Tribunal at a very late stage, after the pleadings had been filed, the oral hearings had concluded, and the three members of the Tribunal had deliberated.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this arbitration is Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A., **(\"Toto\"** or the **\"Claimant\").** Toto is an Italian joint stock company registered at the commercial register of the Chamber of Commerce of Chieti and incorporated under the laws of Italy, with registered offices at Viale Abruzzo 410, 66013 Chieti, and with a place of business at Via Sardegna 14, 00187 Rome, Italy. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Bechara S. Hatem and Professor Hadi Slim of *Messrs. Hatem, Kairouz, Messihi & Partners* Law Firm at Ashrafieh, 738 Sioufi Street, P.O. Box 116-2264, Beirut, Lebanon.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Lebanon **(\"Lebanon\"** or the **\"Respondent\").** The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Nabil B. Abdel-Malek, Mrs. Mireille Rached and Mr. Joseph Bsaibes of *Messrs. Nabil B Abdel-Malek Law Offices* at Ashrafieh (Medawar), Pasteur Street, Pasteur 40 Building, 8th Floor, P.O. Box 113-5205, Beirut, Lebanon.1\n\nToto and Lebanon are jointly referred to as the \"Parties\".\n\n**B. Background to the Dispute**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn April 12, 2007, the *International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes* **(ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** received a request for arbitration (the **\"Request\")** dated March 19, 2007, submitted by Toto against Lebanon. The Request was submitted pursuant to the arbitration provisions contained in the Treaty between the Italian Republic and the Lebanese Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments signed on November 7, 1997, and which entered into force on February 9, 2000 (the **\"Treaty\").**\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute arose in relation to a contract dated December 11, 1997 (the **\"Contract\")** entered into between the *Lebanese Republic-Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif des Grands Projets* **(\"CEPG\")** and *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A.,* to construct the Saoufar-Mdeirej Section (the **\"Project\"),** which is a portion of the Arab Highway linking, *inter alia,* Beirut to Damascus.\n\n5.\n\nToto alleges that the Lebanese Government in the person of first the CEGP, and later its successor, the Council for Development and Reconstruction **(\"CDR\"),** both acting on behalf of the Lebanese Government, was responsible for several actions and omissions in relation to the Project, such as delaying or failing to carry out the necessary expropriation of private property, failing to deliver the sites of the work in a timely fashion, failing to protect Toto's legal possession, giving erroneous or undesirable design information and instructions, changing the regulatory framework, and refusing to adopt corrective measures in relation to the aforementioned matters.\n\n6.\n\nThese actions and omissions, according to Toto, caused substantial delays in the construction of the portion of the highway entrusted to it, jeopardized Toto's investment in Lebanon, and had - and are still having - a direct negative impact on the reputation of the Toto group. Toto argues that those actions and omissions are breaches of the Treaty and is seeking an award of damages for those breaches.\n\n7.\n\nMore specifically, Toto requests from the Tribunal an award in its favor2:\n\n*1- Declaring that the Respondent has breached Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the BIT, jeopardizing the Investment made by the Claimant through the Contract and caused damages to said Investment.*\n\n*2- Directing the Respondent to indemnity the Claimant for all material damage set out below caused to its Investment as a result of BIT breaches:*\n\n*a- Compensation for additional costs incurred because of delays in expropriations and in removing Syrian troops, failing to secure the use of expropriated parcels and to integrate in the design rules and standards edicted by the Republic of Lebanon for public safety and security purposes. The total amount of the compensation is L.P. /16,040,766.976/ (sixteen billions forty millions seven hundred sixty six thousand nine hundred seventy six Lebanese Pounds), equivalent to USD 710,694,000/ (ten millions six hundred ninety four thousand US Dollars), being the aggregate of the amounts shown in Exhibits MM 48, MM 49, MM 50 and MM 51.*\n\n*b- Compensation for additional costs incurred because of changes in legislation, for a total amount of L.P. 833,386,120 (eight hundred thirty three millions three hundred eighty six thousand one hundred twenty Lebanese Pounds) equivalent to USD 545,590 (five hundred forty five thousand five hundred ninety US Dollars) being the aggregate of the amounts shown in Exhibits MM 59, MM 60 and MM 61.*\n\n*3- Directing the Respondent to pay to the Claimant:*\n\n*a- Interest on payments received after due date, for a total amount of L.P. /80 7,799,23 7/ (eight hundred seven millions seven hundred ninety nine thousand two hundred thirty seven Lebanese Pounds) equivalent to USD 538,000 (five hundred thirty eight thousand US Dollars) (Exhibit MM 62).*\n\n*b- Compound interest on amounts claimed under the present Request, totaling L.P. 17,681,952.333/ (seventeen billions six hundred eighty one millions nine hundred fifty two thousand three hundred thirty three Lebanese Pounds) equivalent to USD /11,769,590/ (eleven millions seven hundred sixty nine thousand five hundred ninety US Dollars). The interest should be calculated based upon the above figure at LIBOR* *rate + 5, from the due date up to the date of effective payment by the Respondent.*\n\n*4- Directing the respondent to compensate the Claimant for the loss of opportunities, for a total amount of L.P. 8,562,253.000 (eight billions five hundred sixty two millions two hundred fifty three thousand Lebanese Pounds) equivalent to USD /5,980,000/ (five millions seven hundred and nine thousand US Dollars). The same basis of calculation should be adopted for subsequent years until the Award is fully executed.*\n\n*5- Directing the Respondent to compensate the Claimant for moral damage suffered, for a total amount of L.P. 6,048,403.161/ (six billions forty eight millions four hundred three thousand one hundred sixty one Lebanese Pounds) equivalent to USD 4,010,877 (four millions ten thousand eight hundred seventy seven US Dollars), as explained in \u00a7289, 290 and 291 of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial.*\n\n*6- Directing the respondent to pay the Claimant the arbitration and arbitrators \u2019fees and expenses as well the Claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.*\n\n*7- Ordering any such further relief as may be available and appropriate in the circumstances.*\n\nToto\u2019s claims are quoted from the Claimant Reply onMerits of August 10, 2011, pp. 100-101.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn June 8, 2007, Lebanon appointed as arbitrator, Mr. Fadi Moghaizel, a Lebanese national. By letter of July 27, 2007, the Centre informed Lebanon that it could not proceed with Mr. Moghaizel\u2019s appointment in view of Rule 1(3) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), according to which the co-national of a party to a proceeding cannot be appointed as an arbitrator by a party without the agreement of the other party to the dispute.\n\n9.\n\nOn August 21, 2007, Toto appointed as arbitrator Mr. Alberto Feliciani, an Italian national, and proposed that it would not object to Lebanon's appointment of Mr. Moghaizel as a conational of Lebanon provided that Lebanon did not object to Toto's appointment of Mr. Feliciani as a co-national of Toto. On September 24, 2007, Lebanon confirmed that it had no objection to Mr. Feliciani's appointment.\n\n10.\n\nOn September 27, 2007, the Parties filed a joint letter invoking Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and appointing Professor Dr. Hans van Houtte, a Belgian national, as the third and presiding arbitrator. On October 1, 2007, the Centre asked the Parties to clarify whether Professor Dr. Hans van Houtte\u2019s appointment was by the two party-appointed arbitrators, reflecting the method of constituting the Tribunal agreed by the Parties, or by another method and, if so, to indicate which one. The Parties informed the Centre by joint letter of October 16, 2007, that the appointment of the third arbitrator was by the two party-appointed arbitrators. Thus, the Centre contacted the two party-appointed arbitrators who, on October 19, 2007, confirmed their appointment of Professor van Houtte as the third arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Centre informed the Parties, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, of the constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal and the commencement of the proceedings as of October 30, 2007, with successively Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, Ms. Aissatou Diop and Ms. Milanka Kostadinova, serving as Secretary.\n\n12.\n\nBy joint letter of November 9, 2007, the Parties proposed Paris as the venue of the proceedings. On 20 November 2007, the Tribunal, after consulting with the ICSID Secretariat, scheduled a first session with the Parties for December 13, 2007, at the World Bank European Headquarters in Paris, France. At the first session, the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objections to its Members. The Parties also agreed to bifurcate the arbitration proceedings addressing firstly the issue of jurisdiction and secondly the merits of the case. On December 13, 2007, both Parties agreed to the tentative calendar for the preliminary phase of the proceedings on jurisdiction. Submissions on jurisdiction were filed accordingly.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction at the World Bank European Headquarters in Paris, France, on October 16-17, 2008. In a partial award dated September 11, 2009 **(\"Decision on Jurisdiction\"),** the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction over elements of the dispute and established, *inter alia,* that the dispute arose on June 30, 2004.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 15, 2009, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal an agreed procedural calendar in respect of the proceedings on the merits of the case.\n\n15.\n\nOn October 29, 2009, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1** setting out the time limits for filing submissions on the merits as agreed by the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant and Respondent accordingly filed the following submissions:\n\ni. Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Merits dated January 29, 2010;\n\nii. Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial on the Merits dated May 3, 2010;\n\niii. Claimant\u2019s Reply on Merits dated August 3, 2010; and\n\niv. Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits November 23, 2010.\n\n17.\n\nOn December 16, 2010, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2** directing the Parties to file further submissions in respect of particular issues related to the merits of the case. The hearing dates, scheduled for January 18 -22, 2011, were postponed to early fall, 2011.\n\n18.\n\nThe Parties accordingly filed the following submissions:\n\ni. Claimant\u2019s Submission dated January 7, 2011;\n\nii. Respondent\u2019s Submission dated February 4, 2011;\n\niii. Claimant\u2019s Submission dated February 4, 2011;\n\niv.

The proceeding was suspended in accordance with Rule 10(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 15, 2012, Mr. Feliciani informed the two other members of the Tribunal of certain reasons for his resignation, pursuant to Rule 8 of the Arbitration Rules. The two other members of the Tribunal were unable to consent to his resignation.\n\n23.\n\nPursuant to Arbitration Rule 1 l(2)(a) of the Arbitration Rules, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council proceeded with the appointment of an arbitrator in replacement of Mr. Feliciani. On March 6, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that Judge Stephen M. Schwebel was considered for that appointment. The Parties did not object. By letter of March 16, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that Judge Schwebel accepted his appointment as arbitrator, and that the Tribunal was deemed to be reconstituted as of that date. The proceeding was resumed.\n\n24.\n\nJudge Schwebel received a copy of all the submitted briefs, exhibits, witness statements, expert statements, minutes and records of hearings. The three arbitrators deliberated through teleconference and correspondence.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 1, 2012, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed pursuant to Rule 38 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**B. The Arbitration Clause**\n-----------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThis arbitration is governed by Article 7.2.b of the Treaty which reads:\n\n***SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN A CONTRACTING PARTY AND AN INVESTOR OF THE OTHER CONTRACTING PARTY***\n\n*1- In case of disputes regarding investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, consultations will take place between the Parties concerned with a view to solving the case, as far as possible, amicably.*\n\n*2- If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of written request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute, at his choice, for settlement to:*\n\n*a) the competent court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made; or*\n\n*b) the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) providedfor by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of the other States, opened for signature at Washington, on March 18, 1965, in case both Contracting Parties have become members of this Convention; [...].*\n\n27.\n\nItaly and Lebanon being both members of the Convention, the dispute was submitted to ICSID for settlement.\n\n**C. The Decision on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn September 11, 2009, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction, in which it held the following:\n\n*1) The Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif des Grands Projets and the Council for Reconstruction and Development are public legal entities whose actions are attributable to the Republic of Lebanon;*\n\n*2) Toto's project meets the requirements to be considered as an \"investment\" under the Treaty as well as under the ICSID Convention;*\n\n*3) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute* rati one temporis *under Article 7.2.b and Article 10 of the Treaty as the dispute has arisen on June 30, 2004, i.e., after the Treaty entered into force;*\n\n*4) The Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute pursuant to the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the Treaty rules;*\n\n*5) Subject to the Tribunal's considerations, stated above, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide whether (i) the delay in expropriation, (ii) the failure to remove Syrian troops and (iii) the changes in the regulatory framework, constitute breaches of Article 2 and/or Article 3.1 of the Treaty;*\n\n*6) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to the following claims:*\n\n*a) Erroneous Instructions and Design as breaches of Article 2 and Article 3.1 of the Treaty;*\n\n*b) Disruption of negotiations as breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty;*\n\n*c) Delays in two law suits before the Conseil dEtat as breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty;*\n\n*d) Lack of Transparency in the proceedings before the Consei IdEtat as breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty; and*\n\n*e) Indirect expropriation as breach of Article 4.2 of the Treaty.*\n\n*7) With regard to Article 9.2 of the Treaty, and in the presence of a jurisdiction clause in the Contract, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to breaches to the extent they are violations of the Contract;*\n\n*8) The Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide over breaches of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Treaty, its jurisdiction thereover not being affected by Article 7.2 of the Treaty; and*\n\n*9) The Tribunal deems it improper to stay the proceedings because of the proceedings already pending before the Conseil d'Etat as the Tribunal will not deal with matters covered by those proceedings.*\n\n*10) The decision of the Tribunal with respect to the party who will bear the legal costs and the costs and expenses of the arbitration, and in what proportion, will be included in the final award.*\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n29.\n\nFor the purpose of this decision on the merits, the Tribunal will summarize the pertinent facts. Such summary, however, is not to be taken as prejudging the issues of fact or law considered by the Tribunal.\n\n30.\n\nThe following section sets out the ascertained relevant facts regarding the background to the dispute.\n\n**A. The Project**\n------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe construction of the Saoufar-Mdeirej section, which is the object of the present dispute, is part of the 62-kilometer long \"Hadath-Syrian Border\" highway project linking Beirut to the Syrian border. The Saoufar-Mdeirej portion extends over a total length of 5,525 meters spreading over valleys and mountains. The \"Hadath-Syrian Border\" highway project had been already planned in the seventies by Dorsch, a German company. However, it was only in March 1997, a few years after the end of the 1975-1990 Lebanese Civil War, that the tender documents and technical studies for the Saoufar-Mdeirej section were prepared by a Lebanese company, Gicome. The award of the construction was temporarily granted to Toto for an amount of L.P. 53,294,145.729, *i.e.,* the equivalent of USD 35,352,667.4\n\nDue to the modifications, the revised contract price value became L.P. 60,564,361.619, equivalent to approximately USD 40 million.\n\n32.\n\nThe Lebanese Council of Ministers in its Decision No.40, dated October 16, 19975, ratified the award. The Decision repeated what was expressly contained in the tender documents, more precisely in Article 11.03 *Cahier des Conditions Juridiques et Administratives* **(\"CCJA\")**, *i.e.,* that part of the site would be delivered *progressively* to the contractor as soon as the parcels were expropriated.\n\nExhibit MM3, Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision No. 40, issued on October 16, 1997.\n\n33.\n\nIt was therefore clear that the expropriation of the required parcels to construct the road was not finalised when the Contract was concluded.6 Even just before the Contract was concluded, the alignment of the road was altered from downtown Saoufar to the Grand Hotel.\n\nAlthough the general alignment of the Highway was already established in 1974 and the specific alignment for the Saoufar-Mdeirej section was established in April 1993 by Presidential Decree No. 9169, the latter had been amended in May 1997 by Presidential Decree No. 10267. These Presidential Decrees authorized also the expropriation of the plots and sections that were part of the alignment. See Exhibit R 32.\n\n34.\n\nBy a letter dated November 18, 1997, Toto accepted, without reservation, to execute the Project for the unit prices and within the time prescribed for completion of the Contract.7\n\nExhibit R2.\n\n35.\n\nThe necessary expropriations for the change in alignment were ordered on November 26, 1997.8\n\nPresidential Decree no. 11396, Exhibit R 33.\n\n36.\n\nOn December 11, 1997, CEGP notified Toto that it accepted Toto\u2019s offer to execute the Project as amended.\n\n**B. The Contract**\n-------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Contract governing the execution of the Project consists of Special Conditions, Legal Conditions ***(Cahier des Conditions Juridiques et Administratives - CCJA),*** Technical Conditions ***(Cahier des Prescriptions Techniques - CPT)*** as well as other documents, which had been attached to the tender.9\n\nThe complete list of the documents forming part of the Contract is found under Article 1.02 of the CCJA, Exhibit R 34.\n\n38.\n\nThe Contract required Toto to execute mainly the following works:\n\n-The Highway and link roads;  \n-West and East Mdeirej interchanges;  \n-Specific structure works;  \n-Retaining walls, \"passes\", hydraulic structures10;  \n-Viaduct V 25.1 in Mdeirej;  \n-Viaduct Grand Hotel in Saoufar replacing Viaducts V22.1 and VD 23.1; and  \n-Viaduct on Saoufar linking road.11\n\nSee Article 1.01 of the CCJA *\"Nature et objet du March\u00e9\".*\n\nArticle VI.02 (3) CPT. *\"Description du Projecf,* Exhibit R31.\n\n39.\n\nThe Contract provided that CEGP would appoint an engineer (the \"Engineer\") to represent it, to control the execution of the Project, and to instruct Toto in relation to the execution of the works.12 The Contract required Toto to maintain a daily record *journal de chantier\")* which should include, *inter alia,* the events that may be subject of a claim by the Contractor.13 The Contract also envisaged periodical Site Meetings between Toto, CEGP and the Engineer, minutes of which would record the Engineer\u2019s decisions or comments and be countersigned by all parties present.14\n\nArticle 11.06 CCJA, Exhibit R34.\n\nArticle II. 10 CCJA, Exhibit R34.\n\nArticle II. 09 CCJA, Exhibit R34.\n\n40.\n\nThe Contract provided that the works would be completed within 18 months. These 18 months included the hindrances Toto would encounter because of bad weather, the rainy season, holidays, strikes and the conditions then existing in Lebanon. As a compensation for these hindrances, the months of December, January and February were counted as one month.15\n\nArticle II.02 CCJA, Exhibit R34.\n\n41.\n\nCEGP ordered Toto to commence the works on February 10, 1998. The contractual completion date of the works was thus October 24, 1999. The Contract provided for a postcompletion maintenance and guarantee period of 12 months. The Project was thus intended to be completed on October 24, 2000.\n\n**C. Modifications Following the Execution of the Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nSoon after the works had started, Toto proposed modifications to the Project notably:\n\n- Modification of the curved alignment of Viaduct 25.1 into a straight one;  \n- Modification of the Saoufar interchange at the entrance of the Project;  \n- Modification concerning the structure of all the viaducts;  \n- Cancellation of west Mdeirej interchange at the extremity of the Project;  \n- Modification of the east Mdeirej interchange; and  \n- Modification of the route at the level of Saoufar Grand hotel to avoid the costly demolitions of a few houses.16\n\nSee Toto\u2019s formal proposal of variations dated May 4, 1998, Exhibit R 45.\n\n43.\n\nIn November 1998, the Parties entered into Addendum No. 1 to construct a retaining wall in reinforced earth.17\n\nAddendum No.l was signed in November-December 1998 (there are various signatures on the document with different dates).\n\n44.\n\nLebanon accepted the modifications listed above and a new Addendum to the Contract (Addendum No. 2) was signed on December 23, 1998 with the contractual completion date unchanged. Because the alignment of the road was modified, new expropriations had to be carried out.\n\n45.\n\nThe actual construction was only completed in December 2003, and the Project was handed over after the 12-month maintenance and guarantee period, in December 2004. Between 1997 and 2003, Toto submitted various claims to the CEPG and to its successor, the CDR.\n\n46.\n\nSuch claims covered:\n\na) additional costs due to changes in legislation leading to (i) change in customs duties, (ii) increase of the price of diesel, (iii) increase in government fees on cement, and (iv) increase in aggregates prices;\n\nb) increase in the price of bitumen due to delayed execution;\n\nc) additional works due to misleading information;\n\nd) loss of productivity due to unforeseen circumstances;\n\ne) additional costs occasioned by the nature of the soil not meeting the qualifications originally set in the Contract;\n\nf) additional works resulting from a change in the design;\n\ng) delayed site possession and expropriation and unforeseen works; and\n\nh) extra works due to damages caused by third parties on site.\n\n47.\n\nIn August 2001, Toto started two proceedings before the Lebanese *Conseil d'Etat.18* In the first claim, submitted on August 1, 2001, Toto requested to be indemnified for unforeseen works it had to carry out because the nature of the soil did not meet the specifications set out in the Contract. The second claim, submitted on August 24, 2001, requested compensation for additional works because the original design, prescribed in the Contract, had been substantially changed.\n\nA body that controls the legality of governmental actions, and acts as a consultative organ and an administrative court.\n\n48.\n\nBy a letter dated September 12, 2002, Toto submitted to the Engineer a claim for compensation because of the time extension in the amount of LBP 15,289,737.554, but the claim was not admitted.19\n\nExhibit R 69\n\n49.\n\nIt is with this background that Toto has lodged the claims under the Treaty in the present arbitration.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION ON PRELIMINARY ISSUES**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nIn the context of this arbitration, Lebanon has raised several objections that are not directly related to substantive issues pertaining to the works and the Project. Such issues are the following: (A) Toto\u2019s *locus standi,* (B) applicable law, (C) limitation *ratione temporis* of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and (D) the waivers signed by Toto.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal will assess such issues before turning to the matters directly related to the Project and the works.\n\n***A.*** **Toto\u2019s** ***Locus Standi***\n--------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nLebanon contends that, while the Contract was entered into with the company named *Toto S.p.A.,* the Claimant in this arbitration is a different entity named *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A.,* which therefore lacks *\"locus standi\".* Toto replied that the company is the same and supports its argument by the submission of a certificate from the Italian Registrar of Companies evidencing that its name is *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A.* or, in short, *Toto S.p.A.*\n\n53.\n\nThe Parties made several post-hearing submissions in relation to this matter, and Toto explained that the difference in registration numbers of the Company resulted from statutory changes under Italian law, and that such numbers belong to the same entity.\n\n54.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal finds that the certificate and clarifications submitted by Toto give satisfactory evidence that the legal entity is the same and therefore rejects the Respondent\u2019s *locus standi* objection.\n\n**B. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n55.\n\nToto submits that acts or omissions of the CEGP and the CDR in breach of the Treaty or of other applicable rules of law engage Lebanon\u2019s international responsibility. For Lebanon, the Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, stated that only those acts or omissions which involve the exercise of sovereign authority may engage the international responsibility of Lebanon.\n\n56.\n\nLebanon and Toto further disagree to what extent the Tribunal should apply domestic law. For Lebanon, whenever matters are not covered by rules of international law, the law of the Republic of Lebanon applies pursuant to Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention, which refers not only to international law, but also to the law *the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws).\"20* For Toto, even if the Treaty and the principles of international law are silent, international law is \"a *complete system of law that comprises rules applicable to any issue that falls within its scope.\"* Hence, if a matter would not be covered by the Treaty, international law and no other legal order applies.21\n\nArticle 42 reads as follows: *\"(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable. \"*\n\nSee Professor Prosper Weil\u2019s article entitled *\"The State, The Foreign Investor and International Law, the No Longer Stormy Relationship of a M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois\",* Liber Amicorum Ibrahim F.I. Shihata, The Hague, Kluwer Law International, 2001, page 839; and The Annulment Committee in Vivendi II and the UNCITRAL Partial Award rendered in *CME Czech Republic B. V. (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic* on September 13, 2001.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see a need to pass upon the question of the extent to which Lebanese law applies besides the Treaty and the principles of international law. The Treaty and the principles of international law suffice to decide the case at hand.\n\n**C. Limitation** ***Ratione Temporis*** **of Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs a general rule, treaties do not apply retroactively.22 The treaty, moreover, can specify how it applies **ratione temporis.** In the Treaty between Italy and Lebanon, Article 10 provides that *\"the Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have arisen before its entry into force.\"* As the Treaty entered into force on February 9, 2000, disputes which have arisen before that date are not covered by its scope **ratione temporis.**\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 28.\n\n59.\n\nLebanon argues that the subject-matter of the claims that Toto has submitted to Lebanon or the Engineer between 1997 and February 9, 2000 should be excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction because the Treaty only entered into force on February 9, 2000.23 For instance, the alleged failure to remove the Syrian troops certainly pre-dated the entry into force of the Treaty as these troops left the site in September 1998.24 The alleged failure to remove the owners obstructing the site occurred in 1999. Toto commented on the alleged faulty design of the initially conceived Viaduct 25.1 and replaced it by its own design in 1998.25 The last expropriations for the new alignment took place in March 2000.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 88.\n\nSee Minutes of Meeting April 22, 1998 and Exhibit R38.\n\nToto discovered the alleged breach on March 12, 1998 when it informed the CEGP of the error in design.\n\n60.\n\nToto, however, argues that this Tribunal had ruled in its Decision on Jurisdiction that the disputes, which are the subject matter of its present claims, arose on June 30, 2004,26 which is after the Treaty entered into force, when Toto invited Lebanon to submit Toto\u2019s payment claim to arbitration. The disputes thus would fall within the Treaty\u2019s scope *ratione temporis.*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, at paragraph 90: *\"The Tribunal agrees that a mere demand is not a dispute. In the Tribunal\u2019s view the dispute arose on June 30, 2004...T*\n\n61.\n\nFor Lebanon, not only the *disputes,* but also the **breaches** which lead to the disputes, must have arisen after February 9, 2000. The fact that the Treaty applies to *disputes* which have arisen after its entry into force does not mean that the substantive provisions of the Treaty apply retroactively to the **breaches** which have occurred prior to its entry into force.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the CCCG,27 which are part of the Contract, distinguish between *\"difficulties\"* (problems) (Article 50) and *\"contestations\"* (disputes) (Article 51). As held in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal did not consider a mere problem, breach or demand for reparation to be a \"dispute.\"\n\n*Clauses et Conditions G\u00e9n\u00e9rales Impos\u00e9es aux Entrepreneurs* (Decree No. 405/NI of March 1942).\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to reassert in relation to this question that \"breach,\" \"problem\" and \"dispute\" are three different notions. A \"breach\" arises when contractual or treaty obligations are not honored. A \"problem\" arises when that party\u2019s claim is not accepted by the other side, *i.e.,* when the engineer and the contractor have different views which need to be referred for final decision to the employer/administration. On September 12, 2002, Toto requested to be compensated for the additional works and the delay occurred.28 However, the CDR did not take a position, so Toto invited it on June 30, 2004, to have recourse to Article 7 of the Treaty (\"Settlement of Disputes\"). Thus, the dispute, which had been in limbo for months, crystallized then.\n\nExhibit R69.\n\n64.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Lebanon\u2019s argument that the subject-matter of the claims that Toto has submitted to Lebanon or its Engineer between 1997 and February 9, 2000, should be excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**D. The Extension of Time and the Validity of the Waiver**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nUnder the Contract, the works had to be completed on October, 24, 1999. Both Parties agree that Toto has obtained several extensions of time. The disputed issue is whether the waivers of liability, in exchange for such extensions of time, are valid and dispositive.\n\n66.\n\nOn August 25, 1999, Toto requested for the first time to postpone the works\u2019 completion date to December 18, 2000 (\"First Extension of Time\"). CEGP approved this extension of the time for the execution of the project, but by letter of September 22, 1999, the Engineer informed Toto that \"this extension does not constitute any ground for any claims.\"29\n\nExhibit R63. Although no documentary evidence has been submitted that Toto has accepted this condition in the First Extension of Time, no evidence of Toto\u2019s objections has been submitted either. Toto, however, has accepted this extension, thereby also impliedly accepting the waiver. Moreover, Toto has waived all claims for compensation of the delay in the Second Extension of Time (see footnote 31).\n\n67.\n\nSubsequently, on October 11, 2000, Toto requested a second extension of time until September 28, 200130 and in its letter, Toto expressly stated that it waived all claims regardless of their nature and origin before the date of making the request:\n\n*Dans tous les cas, nous d\u00e9clarons renoncer express\u00e9ment \u00e0 toutes r\u00e9clamations quelque soit leur nature, leur origine et leur genre ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la date de la formulation de cette demande, et cons\u00e9quentes \u00e0 l\u2019extension des d\u00e9lais contractuels.*\n\nExhibit R64.\n\n68.\n\nOn October 19, 2000,31 CEGP accepted Toto\u2019s request of October 11, 2000 (\"Second Extension of Time\"):\n\n*The Board decides: to approve the program of works proposed and subsequently to extend the period of execution of Sawfar - Mdeirej section up till 28/9/2001 provided the Contractor Toto waives any claim whatever is its source or kind or nature related to the* *period from the beginning of the works until this date including the reasons that led to the request of this extension.*\n\nExhibit MM3 9.\n\n69.\n\nCEGP subsequently granted a third extension of time to Toto until November 15, 2001, provided that Toto waived any rights resulting from such extension (\"Third Extension of Time\").32\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, paragraph 164.\n\n70.\n\nIn fact, Toto did not hand over the works on November 15, 2001 but on December 12, 2001 *(deception provisoire')33* Meanwhile, additional works had to be executed after December 2001 with new prices and new completion dates. The CDR thus approved an extension of time for the \"new works\" till August 4, 2002 (\"Fourth Extension of Time\").\n\nExhibit R66, Article IV.04 CCJA refers.\n\n71.\n\nOn August 13, 2002, the CDR approved Toto\u2019s new request for extension of time until December 31, 2002 provided that *\"the Contractor waives in advance its right to claim any compensation or indemnities as a result of such extension.\"34* On September 13, 2002, Toto accepted this additional extension of time, but indicated that it could not possibly waive in advance any such claim arising from this extension (\"Fifth Extension of Time\").35 Actually, one day before, by a letter dated September 12, 2002, in the claim of L.P. 15,289,737.554 it submitted to the Engineer, Toto included compensation for the extra time.36 On September 23, 2002, Toto repeated to the CEGP that it did not waive any claim for compensation as the last extension concerned the performance of additional works, and not the Project itself.37\n\nExhibit MM98.\n\nExhibit R67. There was also another request for extension of time until June 2003, but the Parties did not submit documentary evidence in relation to such request.\n\nExhibit R69.\n\nExhibit R68.\n\n72.\n\nBoth Parties do not dispute that Toto has obtained the successive extensions of time. However, they disagree on whether the waivers of liability granted for the four first extensions are valid and binding for Toto.\n\n**1. Lebanon\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n73.\n\nAccording to Lebanon, Toto, while obtaining the first four extensions of time, repeatedly waived its right for compensation for the delay resulting from the alleged breaches at stake in the present proceedings. For instance, on the occasion of the Third Extension of Time, Toto waived any rights it may have had prior to October 11, 2000. This waiver covered the alleged late expropriation of the parcels as all parcels had been delivered in June 2000. Moreover, at that time, the plans for the retaining wall had been modified38, the Syrian troops had left the site, the obstruction of the owners had ceased, and Toto had already criticized the original plans for the Viaduct 25.1 and waived any rights connected with the modification of that Viaduct.39\n\nExhibit MM8, Amendment No.l, with respect to the unstable soil problem. Fifth Article reads: \"The Contractor waives any right or claim or indemnity that result of this Annex.\"\n\nExhibit R53, Amendment No.2, Article 6: *\"The second party (Toto) shall relinquish any right, legal proceedings, claim, or compensation stemming from this addendum*\n\n74.\n\nMoreover, Toto had not requested an extension of the original Contract period in the 2001 proceedings before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat.*\n\n75.\n\nBesides, Lebanon adds, the fact that Toto did not claim compensation for the extra time to execute the works is not surprising. It had committed under Articles 11-02 and 11-03 of CCJA not to claim damages for late delivery of the sites, bad weather and all \u2018circumstances existing in Lebanon\u2019 *(\u2018conjuncture existante dans le pays\")40* Moreover, during the performance of the Contract from 1998 to September 2002, Toto failed to claim relief because of delay, in due time. It did not submit to the Engineer claims for compensation for additional costs because of the extension of time. It also did not contest any of the Engineer\u2019s decision within the 60-day time limit, as required by the Contract. Toto did not inform CEGP *\"as soon as possible\"* of all events which may have repercussions on the period of execution as required by Article 11-02(2) of the CCJA. It thus consolidated and reiterated its express waivers regarding the extension of time.\n\nExhibit R34.\n\n76.\n\nLebanon contends that it was only in September 2002 that Toto, in its claim to the Engineer, requested for the first time compensation for the postponement of the completion date. This late claim was totally inconsistent with the attitude it had taken the years before. Toto\u2019s conduct estopped it from now claiming compensation for the extra time beyond the original completion date, otherwise, Toto would be acting in a manner inconsistent with the position it had taken at least until September 2002. Toto can thus not be compensated for any claim arising out of the extension of the completion date.\n\n77.\n\nFor Lebanon, the waivers apply to contractual as well as to Treaty claims. The waiver in the letter of October 11, 2000 for instance, is clear, explicit and \"categorical.\" It concerns only the extension of time,41 but covers any recovery whatever its origin and nature. Consequently, Lebanon argues that this waiver extends to Treaty claims related to extension of time.\n\nSee letter of February 6, 2001, Exhibit MM93: *\"Par ailleurs, la renonciation contenue dans notre lettre du 11.10.2000 est bien sp\u00e9cifique. Elle se limite \u00e0 la renonciation en ce qui concerne seulement \u2018extension des d\u00e9lais.\"*\n\n**2. Toto\u2019s Position**\n----------------------\n\n78.\n\nToto denies that by letter of October 11, 2000, it waived its right for compensation of the additional time to perform the works required as a result of Lebanon\u2019s delays. For Toto, a waiver cannot be implied or deduced from any of its acts or omissions. Its attitude after October 11, 2000 does not imply a waiver either. On the contrary, its claims filed before the *Conseil d\u2019Etat* and made to the Engineer indicate that it intended to claim compensation.\n\n79.\n\nAlso, referring to the UNCITRAL Award of ***CME*** r.s. ***Czech Republic,*** Toto points out that waivers obtained under duress are invalid under Lebanese as well as under international law.\n\n80.\n\nToto submits that, having substantially invested in the Project, it needed the extensions to complete the Project. Toto had no other choice than to accept the waiver of compensation in exchange for additional time. For Toto, there was no real consent. On February 6, 2001, Mr. Paolo Toto objected to CEGP\u2019s request that Toto waives its claim for compensation on the occasion of the second extension. In its letter of September 23, 2002, Toto indicated to the President of CDR that such waiver had not *\"any legal justification but is due to a procedure usually implemented in CDR whenever an extension of time is granted\"*\n\n81.\n\nFor Toto, the waivers were extorted in breach of the required fair and equitable treatment and they diminish the value of the investment. As both results are inconsistent with Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty, the waivers have no effect under the Treaty. Toto submits that the waivers must clearly, explicitly and categorically indicate that they also covered Treaty claims. Lebanon failed to adduce any clear evidence in this respect.\n\n82.\n\nFurthermore, Toto argued that its waivers were not validly made in the context of a settlement agreement, as it did not knowingly renounce its rights in exchange for concessions from the other party. Toto states that it waived its rights without any reciprocal concession by Lebanon.42\n\nThis is contested by Lebanon which alleged that the letter of October 11, 2000 was in fact reciprocal and also released Toto from paying liquidated damages. Toto, however, dismisses this allegation as it did not owe liquidated damages and it was ready to start work.\n\n83.\n\nFinally, Toto points out that the Tribunal, distinguishing between contract claims and Treaty claims, ruled that its decision only concerned Treaty claims. Toto\u2019s waiver letter of October 11, 2000, mentions clearly \" *contractual* *time limit,\"* and Addendum No. 2, which *\"waives any right related to that particular Addendum,\"* is an addendum to the Contract and concerns only contractual matters. For Toto, the present arbitration relates to Treaty breaches, while the alleged waivers concern contractual claims and are imposed by provisions of the Contract, such as Articles 11-02 and 11-03 of the CCJA. By waiving compensation for extension of time under the Contract, Toto did not waive its right to claim compensation for Treaty breaches. Waivers related to contractual issues cannot operate to waive Treaty claims.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Toto\u2019s argument that it did not waive its claims to compensation under the Contract unconvincing. The text of the relevant documents is unambiguous. In fact, it is customary in circumstances such as the case at stake that the employer grants time extensions in return for a waiver by the contractor of its right to claim compensation for the additional time to be used to finish the Project. There is no proof that waivers were not granted under the Contract or that they were obtained under duress.\n\n85.\n\nHowever, as stated repeatedly, the Tribunal is concerned by claims of Treaty breaches, and not by breaches of the Contract. Toto\u2019s waiver of its right to invoke the CEGP\u2019s liability under the Contract to claim contractual damages does not affect its right to invoke Lebanon\u2019s breach of the Treaty before this Tribunal. However, as will be elaborated later, the assessment of damages and of the compensation to be granted for a Treaty breach may be affected by a waiver not to claim compensation under the Contract, when both damage claims cover the same harm. Indeed, when it concerns the same damage for the same act, compensation that a Claimant has waived under the Contract cannot be recovered under the Treaty.\n\n**V. THE ACTUAL WORKS**\n-----------------------\n\n86.\n\nIt was clear that, before the Contract was entered into, the sites and plots where the highway had to be constructed had not already been expropriated but had to be successively delivered to the contractor in the course of the works. Article 11-03 of the CCJA specified that the delivery of parts of the site would be made *progressively* to the Contractor as soon as the parcels were expropriated. This was restated by the Council of Ministers in its Decision No. 40, dated October 16, 1997,43 which ratified the award of the Project to Toto.\n\nExhibit MM3, Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision No. 40 issued on October 16, 1997.\n\n87.\n\nMoreover, before Toto had signed the Contract, it had proposed to change the *trac\u00e9* of the road at the level of Saoufar, which thus required additional expropriations which were ordered on November 26, 1997, *i.e.,* merely two and a half months before the works started in February 199844\n\nPresidential Decree No. 11396 of November 26, 1997, Exhibit R33.\n\n88.\n\nWell informed that the sites and plots would be delivered progressively after they would have been expropriated, Toto prepared a \u2018Preliminary Work Program\u2019, which it revised twice in January and March 1998 but could not submit to the Tribunal.45\n\nGiven that the Preliminary Work Programme and the Revisions A and B are not submitted, Toto\u2019s initial or revised work plan intentions are not known. Besides, Lebanon asserts that neither the Preliminary Programme nor the Revisions A and B were approved by the CEGP, in particular because they went beyond the completion date in the Contract (R48).\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore unable to determine how Toto intended to manage the successive delivery of the parcels; however, in May 1998 Toto established a new version of the Work Programme which probably reflected to a large extent the previous programmes and provided that the parcels and plots would be delivered in three stages46:\n\nLot 1: 20/2/98 (PK 25+200 - PK 26+300)  \nLot 2: 22/04/98 (PK 25+200 - PS 23.1)  \nLot 3: 15/07/98 (PS 23.1 - start)\n\n*Programme des Travaux D\u00e9finitif, R\u00e9vision C- 21 May 1998,* Exhibit MM101.\n\n90.\n\nAlthough this Work Programme has not been formally approved by the Engineer, *inter alia* because the dates on which the respective plots actually would be delivered were not yet clear, it may be assumed that it has received the approval of CEGP.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal has consolidated the maps submitted by the Parties (attached to this Award) and has outlined the dates on which the respective parcels have been delivered, with reference to the lots and colours of Attachment 1, as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ***Date*** | ***Lot*** | ***Details*** | ***Colour*** | ***Exhibit*** |\n| February 10, 1998 | Lot 1 | 1) 50% of the workload  2) PK24900 to PK26300  3) Syrian troops  4) 1400m  5) Mdeirej Interchange on the left and Viaduct 25.1 on the right | Yellow Area | MM4 |\n| April 22, 1998 | Lot 2 | 1) PK 24+000 to PK 24+650  2) 675m | Green Area | MM15 |\n| September 29, 1998 | Lot 3 | 1) PK0+175 to PK 1+800  2) 1625m  3) the Viaduct Grand Hotel is situated on the left of the Pink Area  4) Problems with owners | Pink Area | MM15 |\n| April 28, 1999 | Lot 4 | 1) 11 parcels (Decision No. 15/1) 2) Saoufar Interchange | Dark Blue Area | MM16 |\n| June 14, 1999 | Lot 5 | 1) Decision No. 42/ 1 2) Saoufar Link Roads | Olive Green Area | MM17 |\n| August 4, 1999 | Lot 6 | 16 parcels (Decision No.60/1) | Brown Area | MM18 and 19 |\n| January 19, 2000 | Lot 7 | 1) Decision No. 7/ 1 2) Viaduct 25.1  3) Modified from Curved to Straight Viaduct | Sky Blue Area | MM21 and 22 |\n| March 14, 2000 | Lot 8 | 1) 7 parcels (Decision No.47/1)  2) Viaduct 25.1 | Dark Red Area | MM22 |\n| June 26, 2000 -All expropriations completed on this date47 | Lot 9 | 1)5 parcels (Decision No.72/1) 2) Saoufar Interchange | Dark Pink Area | MM24 and 25 |\n\nExhibit MM25.\n\n92.\n\nIn brief, while the Work Programme provided for a delivery in three stages, with the last delivery in July 1998, the plots and parcels were actually delivered in nine stages, with the last delivery in June 2000, *i.e.,* 24 months later.\n\n93.\n\nOriginally, the works had to be completed by October 24, 1999. In view of the substantial delays, the completion date was extended several times and the works were actually finally completed in December 2003 after further extensions of time.\n\n94.\n\nThe relevant facts as well as the Parties\u2019 respective positions with regard to the nine lots listed above are summarized here below.\n\n**A. Lot 1 - Yellow Area**\n--------------------------\n\n95.\n\nOn February 10, 1998, Toto received the order to start construction on Lot 1, PK24900 to PK26300 (1400 m),48 where also a curbed viaduct had to be built and which corresponded to 50% of the workload.\n\nExhibit MM4.\n\n96.\n\nPursuant to the initial work programme, the parcels of Lot 1 had to be delivered on February 20, 1998. According to Toto, however, Lot 1 was only *\"theoretically\"* put at its disposal at that date and was not in fact available. Toto states that *\"major parts\"* of Lot 1 were occupied by the Syrian Army and that, as the *trac\u00e9* of Viaduct 25 was modified from a curved structure to a straight one, the parcels that had been expropriated were not sufficient to enable effective work and progress.\n\n97.\n\nLebanon argues that this initial work programme had not been approved by the Engineer, and that, moreover, Toto does not indicate when the respective parcels had actually been delivered. Lebanon further argues that Toto should not focus on the delivery date of its initial work programme since the *trac\u00e9* has been substantially changed because of the changes in Viaduct V 25.1 that Toto had proposed.\n\n98.\n\nThe two causes for the delay in the construction of Lot 1, *i.e.,* (a) the presence of the Syrian troops; and (b) the change in the alignment of Viaduct 25.1, will now be addressed by the Tribunal.\n\n**1. The Presence of the Syrian Troops**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*a) Toto\u2019s Position*\n--------------------\n\n99.\n\nToto alleges that the construction in Lot 1 was delayed by more than seven months because it was not allowed to access the parcels that were occupied by the Syrian Army along the original alignment until September 11, 1998. Toto adds that it constantly reminded Lebanon of the fact that it was prevented by the Syrian Army to build the workshop in a zone adjacent to the Viaduct as planned in the initial work programme. Since Toto was adamant in starting the works, it had to scatter its workshop in other less appropriate locations. Because of the delay in starting the works and the inefficient location of the workshop, Toto was prevented from working on the site, and it incurred additional costs.49 For instance, Toto\u2019s specialized equipment remained idle for a long period of time.\n\nExhibits MM31, MM32 and MM33.\n\n*b) Lebanon\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------\n\n100.\n\nLebanon contends that Toto visited the site before it entered into the Contract, was aware of the presence of the Syrian Army, and expressed no reservations.50 Moreover, the area occupied by the troops was confined to an area of 250m out of the total 1,400m. Therefore the Syrian troops could not have substantially hindered the works.51 Although the Syrian Army expressly informed the Engineer and Toto that Toto could work in the other parts and Toto stated that it had the intention to start work the next day, Toto failed to mobilize any equipment and start work. Moreover, approximately two months after Toto\u2019s request to evacuate the Syrian troops, the Syrian Army troops started moving out in May upon Lebanon\u2019s insistence, although Lebanon had no authority over them. They definitively vacated the site in September 1998. Despite this complete evacuation and constant reminders from the Engineer, Toto still failed to carry out work at or near the zone for months after the troops had completely left.\n\nExhibit R40.\n\nExhibit MM76 (black spot in the Yellow Area). Toto was working at PK 24900 while the Syrian troops were on PK 25000 (Record 1.26). Lebanon furthermore argues that the Monthly Report upon which Toto relies to prove alleged problems with the Syrian Army, have no evidentiary value because those reports were only signed by Toto and not by the Engineer and Toto. However, the Tribunal considers such argument unconvincing as it is not in dispute that the Syrian troops effectively occupied some sites.\n\n101.\n\nThe Syrian Army, which only occupied an area of 250 m, could not have prevented Toto from installing its workshop elsewhere, which was done by Toto. In any event, Lebanon is not responsible to provide space for the workshop, as this workshop was not included in the alignment of the road, for which Lebanon had to deliver the space. Toto could install the workshop at the place of its choice and was compensated for such installation.52 Moreover, in the Contract, Toto had recognized that it would accept the \u2018specific Lebanese circumstances\u2019 which certainly included the presence of Syrian troops. Finally, Toto\u2019s statement that the Syrian Army denied passage or prevented Toto to mobilize its special machinery is not supported by evidence.53\n\nBesides, Toto failed to submit the workshop plans for approval to the Engineer. See also Article 11.22 CCJA.\n\nMost specific machinery was probably needed for the construction of the straight Viaduct, decided after the Syrian troops had left.\n\n102.\n\nLebanon submits that Toto never intended to start work immediately when the order to commence work was given. At the tender stage, Toto received conceptual drawings of the viaducts and had to prepare the design and the shop drawings related thereto, which had to be approved by the Engineer before the construction could start. From the very beginning, Toto intended to construct another Viaduct than the one foreseen in the tender and to change the Project design.54 For instance, in the first Site Meeting, held just 10 days after the commencement of the works, Toto unofficially showed a set of drawings for the variation of the Viaduct. Toto was seeking to modify the \"decks\" *(tablier)* of all the Viaducts and to replace the curved alignment of Viaduct 25.1 by a straight one,55 so that the *trac\u00e9* of the Viaduct shifted meters away from the original one and different and additional parcels had to be expropriated.56 According to Lebanon, Toto froze all operations until the variations were approved.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter Memorial on the Merits, dated May 3, 2010, paragraph 111.\n\nAttachment 1, compares Lot 1 being the curved Viaduct 25.1 with Lot 7 being the modified straight viaduct\n\nExhibit R119.\n\n**2. The Challenges Related to Viaduct 25.1**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nIt is an agreed fact by both Parties\u2019 expert witnesses, Dr. Romano Allione for Toto and Steve Hughes for Lebanon, that the viaducts were the most crucial structures in the whole project.\n\n104.\n\nThe original Project, as proposed by CEGP in its tender documents, provided for the construction of a curbed Viaduct with the traditional techniques. Although Toto contractually accepted to build the curbed viaduct as required under the tender, on March 12, 1998, it proposed to the Engineer a straight viaduct with pre-cast beams, installed by a launching girder. Toto justified this change, *inter alia,* by the argument that a straight viaduct would be safer for traffic, and that the viaduct would offer a better seismic protection. At the hearing, these alleged advantages were extensively discussed, notably by Mr. Mounir Chehade and Dr. Ibrahim Khatib, respectively Toto\u2019s and Lebanon\u2019s expert.57\n\nSee Transcript of Day 2 of the Hearing on the Merits (Transcript Day 2) as well as Transcript of Day 1 of the Hearing on the Merits (Transcript Day 1) at pp. 41-43.\n\n105.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s eyes, whether the variation was better than the original bridge, or whether Toto preferred a straight viaduct to be able to use its launching girder, is irrelevant to the case, since both Lebanon and Toto, as will be mentioned further, agreed to implement the variation.\n\n106.\n\nAccording to Lebanon, Toto\u2019s work did not progress sufficiently. The Minutes of Meeting dated March 12, 1998, recorded that Toto had not made any design or performed any works in Lot I.58 In those minutes, Toto neither objected to that statement, nor to the Engineer\u2019s reminder that variation is no ground for delay.\n\nExhibit R42.\n\n107.\n\nAt the Site Meeting of April, 2, 1998, the Engineer requested Toto to submit as soon as possible its variation regarding Viaduct 25.1.59 In early July 1998, the Engineer had still not received the final financial data regarding Viaduct 25.1 needed to determine the additional costs.\n\nExhibit R41.\n\n108.\n\nOnce again, on September 17, 1998, the Engineer urged Toto to submit shop drawings.60 Finally, at the Site Meeting of October 7, 1998, the Engineer did not accept the variations and referred the matter for final decision to CEGP.61 CEGP gave Toto three choices in respect of the execution of Viaduct 25.1.62 Toto replied on October 22, 1998, that it chose to follow its own variation.63\n\nExhibit R49.\n\nExhibit R50.\n\nExhibit R51.\n\nExhibit R52.\n\n109.\n\nTo modify the construction of Viaduct 25.1, the costs of the amended construction needed to be approved, and the Contract needed to be amended.\n\n110.\n\nToto, which had suggested the variation, had to lay down the complete design and plans for the new Viaduct 25.1.64 It submitted some provisional proposals, but according to Lebanon, it was late in submitting a complete proposal in spite of the repeated reminders by the Engineer.65 It submitted the design for approval by CEGP on May 4, 1998. However, because a pre-stress viaduct with precast girders was unfamiliar to the CEGP, CEGP asked a third party-expert, Calgarop, to verify the design. In July 1999, Toto submitted a first financial study of the construction of the Viaduct for further discussion. On August 28, 1998 the variation of Viaduct 25.1 and its financial data were finally submitted. In October 1998 Amendment No. 2 approved the variation in Viaduct 25.1 as well as the variation of the Viaduct of the Grand Hotel, which also would be constructed with the same pre-cast technique.66 However, this Amendment had to be signed by the Engineer and CEGP and to be ratified by the *Cour des Comptes,* which took place on December 23, 1998. Before that date, Toto did not consider the Amendment as sufficient instructions to start the works.\n\nD\u2019Onofrio, Transcript Day 1, p.87; Chehade, Transcript Day 2, pp.151-154 and.171-172; Rached, Transcripts Day l,p. 72.\n\nExhibits R41,R93, and R94.\n\nExhibit R53.\n\n111.\n\nThe areas previously expropriated and delivered for the construction of the initial, curbed viaduct, could not be used for the amended straight viaduct. Other terrain needed to be expropriated and delivered for construction. However, after the Amendment was ratified, Toto did not immediately request CEGP to expropriate the areas required for the construction of the amended Viaduct. It only submitted the expropriation plan to the CEGP in February or March 1999.67 The expropriation took place in January and March 2000, *i.e.,* around one year after Toto requested such expropriations.\n\nChehade, Transcript Day 2, p.140.\n\n112.\n\nBefore the construction area had been formally expropriated and delivered to Toto, Toto had already started the preparation of the erection of the Viaduct. In order to mitigate damages, it started to prepare the design of the bridge in January and February although the site was not yet fully delivered.68 It submitted its detailed design for control and it cleared the terrain. To the extent possible and feasible, Toto started the construction of the foundations, even before the last design had been approved.69 These preliminary works were necessarily limited in scope. For instance, the proper foundations could only be constructed in April 2000 when the actual load of the bridge was known.\n\nRiachi, Transcript Day 2, pp. 31-32.\n\nRiachi, Transcript Day 2, pp.34-35.\n\n113.\n\nInitially, the construction of the Viaduct 25.1 was unrelated to the construction of the Viaduct Grand Hotel. With Amendment No. 2, both viaducts would be pre-casted and the beams would be installed with the same launching girder. Consequently, Toto planned to first build the Viaduct 25.1 *(i.e.,* from May till November 1999) and then the Viaduct Grand Hotel (, from November - March 2000).\n\n114.\n\nThe fact that no expropriation decree had yet been issued for the altered alignment undoubtedly delayed the construction of Viaduct 25.170 Because of the delay in the expropriation and delivery of the site for the new alignment of Viaduct 25.1, Toto changed the order of construction, and started first with the construction of the piers and the placing of beams of the Viaduct Grand Hotel from September 1999 to September 2000, while the same work at Viaduct 25.1 was done from October 2000 till April 2001. As of November 2000, Toto started launching the girders at Viaduct 25.1.\n\nThis was also confirmed by CEGP in a letter dated September 1, 1999 to the Council of Ministers, Exhibit MM 46.\n\n**B. Lot 2 - Green Area**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Toto\u2019s Position**\n----------------------\n\n115.\n\nAlthough CEGP delivered to Toto Lot 2 (PK 24+000 to PK 24+650), which corresponds to less than 5% of the Project or 675m, on April 22, 1998, as per the initial work programme, this Lot was not delivered \"in a progressive manner\" since it (Green Area) was separated from Lot 1 (Yellow Area) by Lot 6 (Brown Area) which was only delivered on August 4, 1999.71\n\nExhibit R71.\n\n116.\n\nFor Toto, the Contract72 providing for a progressive hand over, the word *\"progressively\"* means *\"continuing by successive steps,\" i.e., \"coming in succession,\"* following one after the other in sequence; *\"consecutively.\"73* Thus, Toto expected Lebanon to act in a consistent manner by delivering the parcels needed for the construction within a reasonable period of time and in a consecutive manner. Since Lebanon\u2019s expropriations were delayed and the parcels were delivered in an inconsistent and incoherent manner, Toto considers that its expectations were unfulfilled and its investment was jeopardized.74\n\nArticle 11.03 CCJA *.\"[...] Le Conseil se r\u00e9serve le droit de livrer l\u2019emplacement des travaux par tron\u00e7ons en fonction de l\u2019avancement des travaux d\u2019expropriation ou de remembrement. L\u2019Entrepreneur r\u00e9ajustera son programme de travail en cons\u00e9quence et en accord avec le Conseil. L\u2019Entrepreneur n \u2019a droit \u00e0 aucune r\u00e9clamation ou indemnit\u00e9 dans le cas du retard dans la livraison de l\u2019emplacement des travaux \u00e0 cause du retard dans la livraison des expropriations. \"*\n\nWebster\u2019s New World Dictionary on Power CD-version 2.1 copyright 1994/95-Zane Publishing.\n\nExhibit MM25.\n\n117.\n\nToto furthermore claims that the soil of Lot 2 was inappropriate to construct the designed slopes and that either additional expropriations or the construction of retaining walls were required. The CEGP decided to widen the construction area,75 which again required additional expropriations,76 two of them even as late as March 14, 2000.77 Notwithstanding the above, Toto worked on the Green Area as the daily reports show.78\n\nHatem, Transcript Day 1, p. 51.\n\nTranscript Day 2, p.49; Exhibit R 119.\n\nTranscript Day 1, p. 34.\n\nExhibits MM80-82.\n\n**2. Lebanon\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n118.\n\nFor Lebanon, Lot 2 was a continuation of Lot 1 and was delivered on time.\n\n119.\n\nLebanon argues that Article 11-03 CCJA, the tender documents and the Council of the Ministers\u2019 Decision No. 40, clearly underlined that CEGP had the right to deliver the sites depending on the progress of the expropriation procedure. Lebanon considers that since the selection process spread from July till November, 1997, Toto had ample time to study the Project and the geographic conditions.\n\n120.\n\nLebanon adds that Toto did not object to the progressive delivery of parcels, or could even not have tendered for the Project. Toto accepted that the delivery of the respective lots would encounter some delays and had to adapt its work programme, as the Contract required.\n\n121.\n\nFor Lebanon, the record shows that Toto did not work on Lot 2 because it was waiting for the acceptance of the various variations which it had suggested, and especially the green light for the construction of Viaduct 25.1; not because it had to wait for additional expropriation.\n\n**C. Lot 3 - Pink Area**\n------------------------\n\n**1. Toto\u2019s Position**\n----------------------\n\n122.\n\nCEGP delivered Lot 3, an area of 1625m (PKO+175 to PK 1+800) and consisting of 20 % of the workload,79 on September 29, 1998, *i.e.,* more than 7 months after the partial order to start works on February 10, 1998, and 2 months later than provided in the initial work programme. In Toto\u2019s opinion, as the *trac\u00e9* of Lot 3 had not been substantially modified, the cause for late delivery could not be the additional expropriations required after the works had started.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paragraph 148.\n\n123.\n\nToto points out that some owners who had not received compensation for their expropriated parcels refused access or a mere right of passage.80 On September 5, 1998, for instance, Toto faced physical obstruction81 and the owners threatened to break Toto\u2019s tools.82 The opposition of owners seriously obstructed Toto\u2019s work.\n\nExhibit MM76-the obstruction from the owners are circled in black in Lot 3 Pink Area.\n\nSee Witness Statement of Mr. Hisham Riachi of March 22, 2011, at p. 3.\n\nExhibit MM40.\n\n124.\n\nToto asserts that Lebanon knew of these difficulties since August 29, 1998 but has not been of much help. At least 6 times, Toto had to solicit the help of the Internal Security Forces83 but without success.84 Obstructions by the owners85 were so serious that CEGP had to grant an extension of time.86\n\nExhibits R50, R85, MM85, MM86, MM87 and R88.\n\nExhibits MM86 and 87.\n\nFor example, with respect to parcel 287 (the owner stood inside his house during demolition), Exhibit MM103; parcel 694 (the police was present twice but unsuccessful), Exhibit MM104, and parcel 19 (tomb of Druze dignitary), Exhibit MM11.\n\nMinutes of Meeting October 19, 2000, Exhibit MM39; Transcript Day l,p. 33;Riachi, Transcript Day 2, p. 19.\n\n125.\n\nLater in the construction, the Municipality of Saoufar also ordered Toto to stop works on Lot 3 because of a waterway.87\n\nLetter dated March 20, 2001 (Exhibit MM12) and letter dated August 23, 2002 (Exhibit MM13).\n\n**2. Lebanon\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n126.\n\nLebanon argues that the initial work programme had not been approved by the Engineer because the exact dates of the expropriations were not yet known.88 Consequently, Toto cannot base its calculation of the delay in delivery of the parcels upon this programme.\n\nExhibit R48.\n\n127.\n\nLebanon adds that, when Toto encountered the opposition of the owners, it merely asked the permission from the occupants to start work instead of seeking police assistance. It did not file a certified report of the obstruction *(constat)* as requested by the Engineer.\n\n128.\n\nLebanon also challenges Toto\u2019s argument that the works on Lot 3 had not been substantially modified. There were minor changes in alignment. Toto had proposed to shorten the length of the Grand Hotel Viaduct, a variation which was later accepted in Amendment No. 2.89\n\nAmendment No. 2, Exhibit R53.\n\n129.\n\nLebanon alleges that, because of the pending modifications, Toto did not seriously initiate work on the site and used the mainly verbal opposition of the owners as an excuse for not working.90\n\nHowever, on September 2, 1998, as he had done at the first site meeting and on several occasions afterwards, the Engineer had reminded Toto once again to use as far as possible the expropriated site and to continue construction on the basis of the original drawings until and unless the proposed variations were approved (Exhibit R48).\n\n130.\n\nOn February 1, 1999,91 in a letter to the Engineer, Toto did not complain that the site was handed over too late. In fact, on that date, 90% of the original Project including Lot 3, as well as lots 1 and 2, were delivered to Toto. The construction of the Grand Hotel Viaduct took place later than originally foreseen because Toto had its structural elements available only in October 2000.\n\nExhibit R54.\n\n**D. Lot 4 - Dark Blue Area**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Toto\u2019s Position**\n----------------------\n\n131.\n\nLot 4 was only delivered on April 28, 1999, instead of on July 15, 1998, as provided in the initial work program, *i.e.,* more than 14 months after the first order to start work on the Project. Moreover, Lot 4 comprised eleven parcels, located in three different areas along the alignment.92 These circumstances prevented Toto from working in an efficient manner. Here again, the CEGP failed to hand over the sites in the progressive manner Toto expected.\n\nExhibits MM 16, 18 and 19.\n\n**2. Lebanon\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n132.\n\nAccording to Lebanon, however, Lot 4 does not relate to the original Project but to the amended one, as proposed by Toto. After the works had started, the design of the Saoufar interchange had been completely changed, the alignment of the link road shifted, and a viaduct was removed.93 Lebanon alleges that because the project has been modified upon Toto\u2019s proposal, Toto is not entitled to refer to the deadline of the original Project.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paragraph 176. See Attachment 1.\n\n**E. Lot 5 - Olive Green Area**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Toto\u2019s Position**\n----------------------\n\n133.\n\nLot 5 was delivered on June 14, 1999 instead of on July 15, 1998, as the initial work programme provided, *i.e.,* more than 15 months after the order to start work. This delay prevented Toto from working in a timely and efficient manner.\n\n**2. Lebanon\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n134.\n\nAccording to Lebanon, however, Lot 5, as well as Lot 4, do not relate to the original Project but to the amended one. Indeed, the design of the interchange has been completely changed, the alignment of the link road shifted, and a viaduct has been deleted.94Lebanon argues that because the project has been modified upon Toto\u2019s proposal, Toto is not entitled to refer to the deadline of the original Project.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paragraph 176. See Attachment 1.\n\n**F. Lot 6 - Brown Area**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Toto\u2019s Position**\n----------------------\n\n135.\n\nToto argues that Lot 6, which has not been the object of any modification in alignment, comprised 16 parcels located in two different places for which the expropriation order was issued only on August 4, 199995, *i.e.,* 2 months before the original completion date. At a very early stage, Toto had informed Lebanon about the mandatory slope protection in Lot 6 that was required because of the sliding soil.96 It took Lebanon 7 months, until November 1998, to decide on the matter and to enter into Addendum No.l of the Contract.97 Toto was then ready to start works but the expropriation was ordered only 9 months later.98 The Lot was delivered on October 24, 1999, although many of its parcels had not yet been expropriated at that time.99\n\nExhibits MM 18 and 19.\n\nExhibit MM7; Letter dated August 28, 1998. Documentary evidence of Toto working on the area is found in Addendum No. 1 to the Contract (MM 8 *\u2018it appeared during the excavation works the presence of unstable soil within the course of the highway,... which required sustaining walls \u2019).*\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Hisham Riachi of March 22, 2011 at p. 8.\n\nExhibit MM8, Addendum No. 1 to the Contract.\n\nTranscript Day 1, pp. 34-35; Rached, Transcript Day 1, p. 63.\n\n**2. Lebanon\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAccording to Lebanon, although Lot 6 was not directly affected by the modifications, the variation of Viaduct 25.1 had an impact on Lot 6 as well. That is why the Parties agreed to postpone its expropriation.100\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paragraph 128 and Exhibit R70.\n\n137.\n\nLebanon alleges that Toto had the obligation to verify the geological nature of the soil, and thus should have been aware of the risks of sliding soil when it tendered for the Contract.101 When the Parties in November 1998 agreed that Toto should construct the retaining wall in \"reinforced earth\" instead of \"reinforced concrete\" in Addendum No.l, contrary to Toto\u2019s allegation, no slope protection or additional works were discussed. Consequently, the sustaining walls cannot be considered additional works which caused a delay for which CEGP would be responsible.\n\nArticle 1-12 CCJA.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, Lebanon rejects Toto\u2019s allegation that it was ready to start constructing the walls in Lot 6 prior to expropriation. Toto had not submitted yet the corresponding shop drawings with the exact location and procedure to construct the walls for the Engineer\u2019s approval. According to Lebanon, the shop drawings were only submitted in May 1999 and October 1999.102\n\nExhibits R129-131.\n\n**G. Lot 7 - Sky Blue Area, Lot 8 - Dark Red Area, and Lot 9 - Dark Pink Area**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Toto\u2019s Position**\n----------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe changed alignment of the Viaduct 25.1 was accepted in Addendum No. 2 on December 23, 1998 and required delivery of Lot 7, consisting of 7 parcels spread over different places along the alignment. The amended work programme provided for this delivery in February 1999.103 However, Lot 7 was only delivered on January 19, 2000.104\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submissions dated February 4, 2011, paragraph 98, Exhibits MM21 and 22\n\nDecision No. 7/1 (Exhibit MM21).\n\n140.\n\nSeven parcels of Lot 8 were delivered on March 14, 2000.105 Lot 9, with 5 parcels, was delivered on June 26, 2000, and all the parcels required to comply with the modifications in Addendum No. 2 were expropriated and delivered on that date.106\n\nDecision No.47/1 (Exhibit 22)\n\nDecision 72/1 (Exhibits MM24 and 25)\n\n141.\n\nToto argues that the expropriations were too late and delayed the works.\n\n**2. Lebanon\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n142.\n\nLebanon admits that the original expropriation procedure was delayed and had to be started all over again because the variation of Viaduct 25.1 changed the expropriation corridor.107\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter Memorial on the Merits dated May 3, 2010, paragraph 143.\n\n143.\n\nHowever, upon delivery of the lots, Toto did neither start work, nor submit the shop drawings as required under Article VIII 1.10 CPT.108\n\nSubmissions were made progressively, Exhibits R56-61 (a) Drawings related to Viaduct Grand Hotel were submitted progressively in July, August and November 1999; (b) Drawings related to Viaduct 25.1 were submitted in June, July, November and December 1999; (c) Drawings related to Retaining Walls and Underpass Saoufar were submitted in Mayl999; (d) Drawings related to Mdeirej Interchange were submitted in June 1999; (e) Drawings related to Saoufar Interchange were submitted in June 1999; and (f) Drawings related to Overpass P.S. 23.1 were submitted in July 1999.\n\n**VI. CLAIMED BREACHES OF TREATY PROVISIONS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided that subject to the considerations expressed in such Decision:\n\n*\"the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide whether (i) the delay in expropriation, (ii) the failure to remove Syrian troops and (iii) the changes in the regulatory framework constitute breaches of Articles 2 and/or Article 3.1 of the Treaty. \"*\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal also ruled that it had no jurisdiction with respect to (i) erroneous instructions and design, (ii) indirect expropriation, and (iii) breaches that are violations of the Contract.\n\n146.\n\nToto submits that the various delays and disruptions, which also entailed additional costs, were caused by the Respondent in its capacity as a Sovereign Authority, *i.e.,* as holder of the *\"puissance publique.\"* Such delays prejudiced Toto\u2019s investment (Article 2 of the Treaty), failed to ensure fair and equitable treatment (Article 3.1 of the Treaty)109, and to provide full protection and security within the Respondent\u2019s territory (Article 4.1 of the Treaty).\n\nWhere Toto alleges a breach of Article 3 of the Treaty, it in fact restricted its allegation to a breach of Article 3.1 (fair and equitable treatment) and did not allege a breach of Article 3.2 (most favored nation provision).\n\n147.\n\nWhen arguing on the merits, Toto stated that it considered the following matters to be breaches of the Treaty:\n\n1) The alleged late expropriations, which resulted in late delivery of the respective parcels and plots;\n\n2) The failure to remove the Syrian troops from the site;\n\n3) The failure to remove the owners from the site in breach of the Treaty;\n\n4) The faulty design of the initial Viaduct V25 because of Lebanon\u2019s outdated standards; and\n\n5) The change in the regulatory framework.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine each of the claimed breaches. However, it will first consider the Treaty provisions which are allegedly breached.\n\n**A. Treaty Provisions**\n------------------------\n\n**1. Article 2**\n----------------\n\n149.\n\nArticle 2 of the Treaty reads as follows, under the heading \"Promotion and Protection of Investments\":\n\n*(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations.*\n\n*(2)....*\n\n*(3) Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or liquidation of such investments.

Article 3.1**\n------------------\n\n151.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Treaty, under the Heading \"National Treatment and Most Favoured Nation Treatment\" requires Lebanon to ensure fair and equitable treatment of investments:\n\n*\"Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments of the other Contracting Party. This treatment shall not be less favourable than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by its* *own investors, or than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments made within its territory by investors of any third State, if this latter treatment is more favourable.\"*\n\n152.\n\nAs held in ***Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. The United Mexican States113*** as well as in ***EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania114*** and ***Waste Management Inc v. United Mexican States,115*** in light of the principle of good faith established by international law, fair and equitable treatment requires the State116:\n\n*\"...to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\"*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award, May 29, 2003, paragraph 154, Exhibit MM28.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, October 8, 2009, paragraph 216, Exhibit MM29.\n\nICSID Case No ARB/AF/003, Award, April 30, 2004.\n\nTecmed v.

The Czech Republic*** award specified that fair and equitable treatment:\n\n*\"should therefore be understood to be treatment which,... does not at least deter foreign capital by providing disincentives to foreign investors. An investor\u2019s decision to make an investment is based on an assessment of the state of the law and the totality of the business environment at the time of the investment as well as on the investor\u2019s expectation that the conduct of the host State subsequent to the investment will be fair and equitable \"117*\n\nSaluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic, Permanent Court of Arbitration, Partial Award, March 17, 2006, paragraph 301, Exhibit MM41.\n\n154.\n\nIn ***LG&E v. Argentine Republic118*** it was held that fair and equitable treatment required the host State to maintain *\"stability of the legal and business framework in the State party...\"* and in ***Bayindir v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,119*** the Tribunal held that fair and equitable treatment comprises *\"the obligation to refrain... from frustrating the investor\u2019s reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework affecting the investment.\"*\n\nLG&E Energy Corp, LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v.

United Republic of Tanzania,120***\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, July 24, 2008, paragraph 597, Exhibit R79.\n\n156.\n\nIn ***EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania121*** the Arbitration Tribunal unanimously held that\n\n*\"the idea that legitimate expectations, and therefore, FET, imply the stability of the legal and business framework, may not be correct if stated in an overly-broad and unqualified formulation. The FET might then mean the virtual freezing of the legal regulation of economic activities, in contrast with the State\u2019s normal regulatory power and the evolutionary character of economic life\"*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, October 8, 2009, paragraph 217, Exhibit R105.\n\n157.\n\nAn unreasonable or discriminatory measure is defined in this case as (i) a measure that inflicts damages on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose; (ii) a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference, (iii) a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker, or (iv) a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.\n\n158.\n\nIn ***Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania,*** the arbitrators stated:\n\n*\"The expectation is legitimate if the investor received an explicit promise or guarantee from the host-State, or if implicitly, the host-State made assurances or representation that the investor took into account in making the investment. Finally, in the situation where the host-State made no assurance or representation, the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the agreement are decisive to determine if the expectation of the investor was legitimate. In order to determine the legitimate expectation of an investor, it is also necessary to analyse the conduct of the State at the time of the investment.\"122*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, September 11, 2007, paragraphs 331-333.\n\n159.\n\nLegitimate expectations may follow from explicit or implicit representations made by the host state, or from its contractual commitments. The investor may even sometimes be entitled to presume that the overall legal framework of the investment will remain stable. Much depends, however, on the circumstances of the case.123\n\nSee R. Kl\u00e4ger, Fair and Equitable Treatment in International Investment Law, p. 164 *et seq.*\n\n160.\n\nToto\u2019s position is that fair and equitable treatment also includes the duty to act vigilantly and consistently in a coherent manner.\n\n161.\n\nFor an alleged breach of contract to be considered as a breach of the fair and equitable treatment principle, State conduct is required. As was found in ***Impreglio SpA v. Pakistan.***\n\n*\"In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the BIT, it* *\u2018must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt. Only the state in the exercise of its sovereign authority (\u2018puissance publique \u2019), and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT.\"124*\n\nImpregilo SpA v. Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005, paragraph 260 (footnote omitted). See also paragraph 267 of the Decision.\n\n162.\n\nAs was also stated in other decisions, only when the State acted as sovereign authority -and not merely as a contracting partner - was there treaty protection of fair and equitable treatment.125\n\nSee also Consortium RFCC v. Morocco, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6, Award, December 22, 2003, paragraph 51; Joy Mining Machinery Ltd. v. Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award, August 6, 2004, paragraphs 78-79; Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil SA v. Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, August 18, 2008, paragraph 345.\n\n163.\n\nMoreover, in the event a contract has allegedly been breached and the investor has access to the domestic courts, the threshold for a fair and equitable treaty protection may be higher. If the treaty requires recourse to domestic courts, it is not the existence of the contractual breach as such, but the \u2018treatment\u2019 that the alleged breach of contract has received in the domestic context that may determine whether the treaty obligation of fair and equitable treatment has been breached.126\n\nSee Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, September 7, 2007, paragraphs 319-320.\n\n164.\n\nIn the present case, as extensively discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction,127 Toto had access to the domestic courts of Lebanon, but did not establish that it diligently pursued the settlement of its contractual claims before them.\n\nParagraphs 139-168,\n\n165.\n\nFinally, legitimate expectations are more than the investor\u2019s subjective expectations. Their recognition is the result of a balancing operation of the different interests at stake, taking into account all circumstances, including the political and socioeconomic conditions prevailing in the host State.128\n\nR. Kl\u00e4ger, *op.cit.,* p. 186.\n\n166.\n\nThe fair and equitable treatment standard of international law does not depend on the perception of the frustrated investor, but should use public international law and comparative domestic public law as a benchmark. As was recently also confirmed in **Total S.A. v. Argentina,** *\"a comparative analysis of what is considered generally fair and unfair conduct by domestic public authorities in respect to private investors and firms in domestic law may also be relevant to identify the legal standards under BITs.\"129*\n\nTotal S.A. v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, paragraph 111. *See also* Lemire v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010, paragraph 506; Noble Ventures Inc. v. Romania, ICSID case No. ARB/01/11, Award, October 12, 2005, paragraphs 177-178 (Exhibit R90).\n\n167.\n\nArticle 3.1 of the Treaty *in fine* also requires Lebanon to treat Toto\u2019s investment not less favourably than investments of its own nationals or of investors of third countries. Toto has not substantiated a claim that its treatment was less favourable. Consequently, the Tribunal will specifically focus on fair treatment and legitimate expectations.\n\n**3. Article 4.1**\n------------------\n\n168.\n\nToto states that its construction works in Lebanon have not received from Lebanon the full protection and security as required under Article 4.1 of the Treaty which reads:\n\n*\"Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Part.\"*\n\n169.\n\nIn ***AMT v. Zaire,*** the Tribunal held that the obligation of protection and security requires *\"to take all measures of precaution to protect the investment.\"130* In ***Azurix v. Argentina131*** and ***Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania132*** it was moreover held that in case the investment treaty referred to \"full\" protection and security, as is the case for Article 4 of the Treaty between Italy and Lebanon, then the obligation of protection and security goes beyond mere physical security and includes affording a commercial and legal and secure investment environment.\n\nAmerican Manufacturing & Trading v. Zaire, ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1), Award, February 21, 1997, paragraph 6.05 (Exhibit MM42).\n\nAzurix Corp. v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, July 14, 2006, paragraph 408.\n\nBiwater Gauff v. Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, July 24, 2008, paragraph 729.\n\n170.\n\nLebanon quoted ***Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*** to specify the scope of this obligation in the context of investment protection:\n\n*\"the protection of foreign investments is not the sole aim of the Treaty, but rather a necessary element alongside the overall aim of encouraging foreign investment and extending and intensifying the parties\u2019 economic relations. That in turn calls for a balanced approach to the interpretation of the Treaty\u2019s substantive provisions for the protection of investments, since an interpretation which exaggerates the protection to be accorded to foreign investments may serve to dissuade host States from admitting foreign investments and so undermine the overall aim of extending and intensifying the parties\u2019 mutual economic relations.\"133*\n\nSaluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic, Permanent Court of Arbitration, Partial Award, March 17, 1996, paragraph 300, p. 65, Exhibit R92.\n\n171.\n\nToto alleges that the failure to remove the obstructing owners from the site was a breach of Article 4.1, but it did not elaborate on the possibility that the failure to remove the Syrian troops from the site could be a breach of Article 4.1 as well. This being as it is, the Tribunal sees a strong overlap between protection and security under Article 4.1 of the Treaty, and protection of the investment under Article 2.3 of the Treaty. Consequently, the finding that a claim is not covered by Article 2.3 will also entail that it is not covered by Article 4.1.\n\n**B. The Alleged Breaches**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Alleged Late Expropriations**\n----------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nToto submits that expropriations took almost twice the time originally provided for the completion of the works and that the last expropriations occurred only a few months before the actual end of the works. For Toto, it was mainly because of the late expropriations and the non-consequential delivery of the expropriated parcels, that the works took 48 months instead of the initial 18 months. The heavy equipment and plant, the manpower and the purchased construction material were available at great cost, but remained unused. For instance, during the months of January till March 1999, Toto could only do *\"some site preparatory works134 preparation of the new designs of the Viaduct and retaining walls and mainly office work.\"135*\n\nGeotechnical investigation pursuant to the new viaduct in the light blue section, excavation at the Mdeirej Interchange, and clearing.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Hisham Riachi of March 22, 2011, at p. 2.\n\n173.\n\nMoreover, Toto adds, because of the late expropriations, it had to make private arrangements for the temporary use of parcels at great expense, and it even had to suffer and settle a court case filed by one of the owners. Once the parcels for the Viaduct 25.1 had been delivered early 2000, the pace of the works increased significantly, but substantial harm had been suffered by Toto in the meantime.\n\n174.\n\nLebanon contends that Toto knew that not the whole site would be delivered when the works had to start, and that the parcels would be delivered progressively. When it concluded the Contract, Toto accepted the progressive handover of the parcels delivery as soon as they were expropriated. Moreover, it had agreed that it would not claim compensation in case of late delivery.136\n\nArticle 11.03 of the CCJA.\n\n175.\n\nFor Toto, \"progressive delivery\" means \"consecutive delivery.\" As Lebanon\u2019s expropriations were delayed and the parcels were delivered in an inconsistent manner, Toto\u2019s investment was jeopardized and Lebanon thwarted Toto\u2019s expectations.\n\n176.\n\nFor Lebanon, *\u2018progressively\u2019* delivery does not necessarily mean *\u2018consecutively\u2019* in the order the construction was planned. In all events, Lebanon objects to Toto\u2019s argument that the delivery of the parcels had to be carried out in three stages and before specific dates. Lebanon observes that the initial work programme, which mentions these dates, was never approved by the CEPG, because it was uncertain when the respective parcels could be delivered. Likewise and for the same reasons, the delivery dates in Toto\u2019s amended work programme had not been approved and therefore could not be relied upon either.137\n\nExhibit R48.\n\n177.\n\nLebanon further asserts that in the first 7 months, 90% of the parcels under the original Project were put at Toto\u2019s disposal (Lots 1, 2 and 3), so that no substantial delay was suffered.\n\n178.\n\nFor Lebanon, the true reason for the late delivery of parcels was the fact that Toto, once the construction had started, suggested several variations to the Project, of which the most substantial was the construction of the Viaduct 25.1, originally foreseen as a curved bridge, in a straight alignment. Such change required expropriation of the land where the straight viaduct would be built. Moreover, Toto did not start construction of the amended Viaduct before its variation and plans had been approved, which took some time, and it only requested the additional substantial expropriations in February-March 1999.\n\n179.\n\nLebanon adds that Toto suggested also altering the original plans of the Viaduct Grand Hotel, widening the alignment in some places and changing the construction of the Saoufar interchange. These changes too required additional or modified expropriations, which were ordered and had to be carried out after the construction had started. Toto\u2019s argument that the Project was supposed to end in October 1999 and that, therefore, Lebanon expropriated too late, ignores the modifications Toto suggested and which required additional expropriations.\n\n180.\n\nFurthermore, Lebanon alleges that Toto, already late in the execution of the works, froze the construction works pending approval of its modified design of the Viaduct138and failed to mobilize its equipment in due time. For instance, on April 27, 2000, CEGP considered Toto\u2019s available equipment to be insufficient and requested Toto to take the necessary measures to speed up the work.\n\nSee Expert Report of Mr. Steve Huyghe, dated June 15, 2011.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that Toto focuses on the late delivery of the parcels by its contracting partner, the CEGP, while the allegedly late expropriations had to be carried out by Lebanon in its capacity of *\u2018autorit\u00e9 publique.\u2019* Although Toto has submitted the CEGP\u2019s decisions on the delivery of the parcels, it has not submitted evidence that the actual expropriation proceedings by the public authority were unreasonably delayed. The chronology of events indicates that the expropriations were generally finalized within a year.139\n\nThe initially expropriated parcels could of course be delivered sooner as the expropriation process was already on its way before the Contract was concluded.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that Toto does not allege that Lebanon openly mishandled the expropriations in an outright and unjustified repudiation of its own established expropriation practice.\n\n*a) Article 2*\n--------------\n\n183.\n\nToto alleges that the late expropriations and the failure to deliver the parcels in a consecutive order constitute a breach of Lebanon\u2019s obligation to act in a diligent manner to promote and protect Toto\u2019s financial interest in the performance of the Contract, as Article 2 of the Treaty requires. For Toto, Lebanon failed to create and maintain favourable conditions for Toto\u2019s investment.\n\n184.\n\nFor the Tribunal, a breach of Article 2 requires, not only (1) an established delay in expropriation, but also (2) that this delay is attributable to Lebanon.\n\n185.\n\nIt is a fact that the expropriations with regard to the original alignment were substantially finalized before or within the first months after the works had started. Toto did not convincingly demonstrate that - in the first months of the Project - it had been hindered by the fact that not all sites had been expropriated. Indeed, as Toto had proposed substantial variations, which would change the alignment of the highway, it apparently avoided carrying out works on the expropriated sites of the original alignment, which would no longer serve a useful purpose.\n\n186.\n\nOnce the variations had been accepted, new expropriations were needed. It took two months for Toto to request the Lebanese authorities to carry out these expropriations. It took some twelve months for the authorities to carry out the latest of these expropriations. Taking into account the complexity of expropriation procedures, which may involve also court proceedings, the Tribunal is of the view that a time span of twelve months is reasonable.\n\n187.\n\nThe parties have discussed whether Article 2.1 of the Treaty, which obliges Lebanon to \u2018promote\u2019 investments, imposes upon Lebanon an obligation of due diligence, as argued by Toto. Even if \u2018due diligence\u2019 were to be required, Toto has not submitted evidence that Lebanon had not behaved in a diligent way.\n\n188.\n\nArticle 2.3 of the Treaty sanctions unreasonable or discriminatory delays in expropriation which would have impaired Toto\u2019s investment. Toto does not allege that Lebanon acted in a discriminatory fashion. It did not indicate how Lebanon ought to have acted \"in a reasonable manner.\"\n\n189.\n\nArticle 2.4 of the Treaty requires Lebanon in general *\"to create or maintain favourable legal or economic conditions.\"* Toto failed to show how the alleged delay in the expropriations for the construction of a portion of the highway constitutes a failure *\"to create or maintain favourable legal or economic conditions.\"* Toto did not provide particulars in respect of the kind of general legal and economic conditions Article 2.4 refers to. On the contrary, Toto accepted the granting of an extension to complete the works and waived any claim to damages because of the delay in expropriations.140 Such acceptance, in all events, undercuts the factual grounds for arguing that Lebanon failed to protect the investment.\n\nMinutes of meeting October 19, 2000, Exhibit MM39.\n\n*b) Article 3.1*\n----------------\n\n190.\n\nToto submits that Lebanon failed to ensure fair and equitable treatment to Toto\u2019s investment because of the late expropriations. Toto expected expropriations which would not prevent the performance of the Contract within the agreed time frame. Toto alleges that its legitimate expectations of a consistent and consequential delivery of the parcels had been frustrated.\n\n191.\n\nFor Lebanon, Toto could not have legitimate expectations of this nature. When Toto agreed to the Contract, it was aware that the expropriations had not been carried out and that parcels would be delivered progressively in the first months of the works. This was the only expectation Toto could have had. Toto accepted to execute the works within the contractual time limit in spite of the uncertainty concerning the date of delivery of the parcels. Moreover, Toto was aware that additional expropriations needed to be carried out when it proposed to alter the alignment of the Viaduct 25.1 and the road. Toto cannot escape responsibility for the implications of its own proposals. By proposing variations to the *trac\u00e9* of the Project, it accepted the risk of the delay which may result from the additional expropriations.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal fails to see how Toto could have legitimately expected that the parcels would be expropriated earlier than they actually were. Although Toto alleges that it constantly warned CEGP for the delays in expropriation, it did not submit contemporary complaints holding CEGP responsible for them.\n\n193.\n\nFurthermore, fair and equitable treatment has to be interpreted with international and comparative standards of domestic public law as a benchmark. The investor is certainly entitled to expect that the host State will not act capriciously to violate the rights of the investors. Toto indicated that Lebanon failed to carry out the expropriations in a consistent and coherent manner as it would have done if investments of its own or other foreign investors would have been involved. However, Toto did not submit any proof that Lebanon acted in a discriminatory or capricious way, or that it did not comply with the applicable international minimum standards.\n\n194.\n\nOn the contrary, the extension of time and waiver of its claim to compensation because of late expropriations, that Toto accepted, detract from the legitimacy of Toto\u2019s expectations to receive compensation for delayed expropriations.\n\n**2. Failure to Remove Syrian Troops**\n--------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nAs stated before, Toto alleges that it could not proceed with the works as Syrian troops had established a settlement in part of the area that was intended for the main workshop and the construction of the road. Until September 1998, when the soldiers finally left, Toto was denied access to that part. Toto argues that it had to obtain at additional costs another, less appropriate, location to install the workshop. Moreover, when the Syrian soldiers finally moved to another site, Toto had to erect for such soldiers new facilities at its own expense.\n\n196.\n\nLebanon, from its side, states that, under the Contract, it was solely Toto\u2019s responsibility to identify the private or public land to build its workshop, and at its own expense.141 When it signed the Contract, Toto knew where the Syrian troops were, and nevertheless intended to have the workshop at the location of their encampment.\n\nArticle 11-22 CCJA.\n\n*a) Article 2*\n--------------\n\n197.\n\nToto considers the failure to remove the Syrian troops to be a breach of Article 2 of the Treaty, which requires the host State to create and maintain favourable conditions for the investment. For Toto, Lebanon, as a *puissance publique,* failed to promote and protect Toto\u2019s investment, which received a treatment below the international minimum standard because, when the works had to start, the site was still occupied by the Syrian army and not available for the installation of the equipment and workshop.\n\n198.\n\nLebanon contends that Toto did not - as Toto alleges - urge Lebanon to obtain the evacuation of the Syrian troops and indicate that their presence had obstructed the works. Toto merely signalled the presence of the soldiers and indicated that they should be evacuated in order to avoid future delays142 and that the preparation of an access road - not the works as such - was hindered.143\n\nExhibits MM6 and R82.\n\nExhibit MM31.\n\n199.\n\nMoreover, Lebanon recalls that it discussed with the Syrian Army in April 1998 the removal of the troops,144 and the Syrian Army started evacuation in May 1998. It completely left the site in September 1998. Lebanon therefore submits that the time this evacuation took is fair, given the fact that the Syrian Army was a foreign force and not under Lebanon\u2019s purview. Besides, Toto was aware of the occupation, and could have started work on other parts of the area. In fact, for Lebanon, Toto was not actually ready to start the construction of Viaduct 25.1 as it was initially planned because it envisaged constructing that Viaduct on a different location. The evacuation of the Syrian troops was thus not that urgent and did not practically affect Toto\u2019s work.\n\nApril 22, 1998, Minutes of Meeting where Lebanon was represented by the Engineer\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Toto was - or should have been - aware that the Syrian troops occupied areas along the alignment. Taking into account the circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that Lebanon did whatever was within its power to obtain the Syrian troops\u2019 departure. Lebanon did not neglect its obligation under Article 2 of the Treaty to protect Toto\u2019s investment: the measures it undertook to obtain the evacuation of the Syrian troops were not unreasonable or discriminatory, and they proved to be adequate.\n\n*b) Article 3.1*\n----------------\n\n201.\n\nToto argues that, pursuant to Article 3.1 of the Treaty, Lebanon has to ensure within its territory fair and equitable treatment for Toto\u2019s investment. According to Toto, Lebanon acted in an inconsistent manner by failing to ensure that the site occupied by the Syrian Army was evacuated when the works started. For Toto, Lebanon failed to meet Toto\u2019s reasonable and legitimate expectations because it was expected to ensure that the evacuation of the Syrian soldiers would not be delayed so that Toto could complete the works in eighteen months, as provided for in the Contract.\n\n202.\n\nLebanon, on the contrary, points out that Toto was already aware of the presence of the Syrian Army, and it could not reasonably have expected that the Syrian troops would be removed earlier than in fact they were.\n\n203.\n\nToto did not prove to the Tribunal that, in the then prevailing circumstances, Lebanon was inefficient in obtaining the departure of the foreign forces; even less that Lebanon failed to give Toto a fair and equitable treatment in this respect.\n\n204.\n\nToto furthermore alleges that with regard to the evacuation of the Syrian troops, Lebanon provided Toto\u2019s investment a treatment which was discriminatory and less favourable as that required by international law for investments of other foreign contractors working on sites expropriated for public works projects.\n\n205.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal\u2019s view is that Toto did not establish that Lebanon behaved negligently or capriciously, or that it acted discriminatorily or violated the international minimum standard by not obtaining immediately the departure of foreign troops. If in fact it had been established that the presence of Syrian troops for a limited period on part of the site materially prejudiced the Toto\u2019s operations, Toto would have had a good claim, because, as between Lebanon and Toto, the burden of the presence of Syrian troops on the Lebanese territory would have to be borne by Lebanon. In the view of the Tribunal, Toto has not so established.\n\n206.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that Toto did not prove that Lebanon has acted in breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty with regard to the evacuation of the Syrian soldiers.\n\n**3. Failure to Remove Owners from the Site**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nToto contends that, when at times it was prevented by owners of expropriated parcels from accessing their properties, Lebanon failed to intervene to put an end to such obstructions. These obstructions and Lebanon\u2019s negligence, Toto argues, delayed the works and thus caused damage to Toto\u2019s investment.\n\n208.\n\nLebanon, on the other hand, alleges that Toto did not establish that it was actually and physically prevented from working, and that Toto was not ready to work on the expropriated areas in a timely fashion. Toto\u2019s allegations that Lebanon refrained from taking the necessary measures are therefore not only irrelevant, but remain vague and unsubstantiated.\n\n*a) Article 2*\n--------------\n\n209.\n\nToto argues that Lebanon failed to promote and protect Toto\u2019s investment as required by Article 2 of the Treaty, which Lebanon denies.\n\n210.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal has considered that Lebanon\u2019s alleged failure to prevent owners and occupants from obstructing the works could, if proven, constitute a failure to protect investments under Article 2 of the Treaty.145\n\nParagraphs 117 and 118 of the Decision.\n\n211.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not consider Lebanon\u2019s behavior a breach of Article 2. Expropriations, which are known to be generally complex and lengthy procedures, often give rise to objections by expropriated owners with respect to the indemnification standards and amounts of compensation. Toto did not establish that Lebanon had knowledge, or should have had knowledge, of the impending obstructions, and that it failed to take precautions to prevent them. Toto did not indicate what specific actions could Lebanon have taken, and did not take, in order to prevent the protests from occurring. It would be unreasonable to consider that Lebanon had the duty under the Treaty, or had the actual means, to prevent certain owners from expressing their discontent.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Toto\u2019s Monthly Reports mention obstructions from July 1998 to September 1999 in specific locations, by individual expropriated owners. These obstructions and protests were not of a magnitude that revealed a general failure of the expropriation process. Had there been massive protests, this would have been an indicator of a malfunctioning of the expropriation process for which Lebanon could have been held liable under certain circumstances, but this was not the case.\n\n213.\n\nIn addition, it has not been demonstrated that Lebanon failed to take action to end the owners\u2019 obstructions. No formal request from Toto to intervene has been submitted to the Tribunal. Monthly Reports merely signaled the obstruction in some areas. The Tribunal therefore is unable to determine whether Lebanon, as a *puissance publique,* has failed to intervene.\n\n214.\n\nWhat has been established in this case is that (i) the CEGP requested the assistance of the Internal Security Forces to remove expropriated owners,146 (ii) the CEGP indicated in December 1998 that it resorted to the local administration and police force,147 (iii) the CEGP requested the Governor again for the assistance of the Internal Security Forces on March 23, 1999,148 (iv) the CEPG informed the Governor in May 1999 of the specific parcels which still had to be evacuated,149 (v) as of July 1999, only one parcel was obstructed150 but was free in October 1999, and (vi) in September 1999, the CEGP asked the Governor for the assistance of the Internal Security Forces to vacate the last parcels.151\n\nLetter to the Governor of Mount Lebanon, Exhibit MM85.\n\nMinutes of Meeting December 2, 1998, Exhibit R85.\n\nExhibit MM86.\n\nTelegram May 26, 1999, Exhibit MM87.\n\nMonthly reports for the months of July 1999 to October 1999, Exhibit MM39.\n\nLetter of September 24, 1999, Exhibit R88.\n\n215.\n\nFurthermore, Toto does not establish to what extent the temporary obstructions at specific spots actually prevented it from finishing the works by the contractual completion date. In fact, these obstructions were one of the reasons for which Toto had obtained a postponement of the contractual completion date.152\n\nMinutes of Meeting of October 19, 2000, Exhibit MM39.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore determines that Lebanon\u2019s breach of Article 2 of the Treaty has not been established by Toto in relation to the matter of the owner\u2019s obstructions.\n\n*b) Article 3.1*\n----------------\n\n217.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal stated that Lebanon\u2019s failure to act against the obstructing owners would fall under the protection of legitimate expectations of Article 3.1 of the Treaty if this failure was proven to be unfair and inequitable.153\n\nParagraph 175 of the Decision.\n\n218.\n\nToto contends that Lebanon failed to ensure a fair and equitable treatment of its investment as required by Article 3.1 of the Treaty, because Lebanon failed to respect Toto\u2019s legitimate expectations to be able to use the expropriated parcels.154\n\nParagraphs 174 and 176 of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Merits dated January 29, 2010.\n\n219.\n\nLebanon argues that, absent any specific representation made by Lebanon regarding obstructing owners, the doctrine of legitimate expectations does not apply, and therefore no breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty has occurred.155\n\nParagraphs 384 and 386 of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits dated May 3, 2010.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it would be unreasonable to expect Lebanon to guarantee that no owner objects to the expropriation process including, *inter alia,* by obstructing access to his/her parcels.\n\n221.\n\nThe Contract had foreseen that problems may arise with the owners of parcels located along the alignment *(\"riverains\")* and that Toto should refer obstructions to the local police.156\n\nParagraphs 364 and 386 of the Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial on the Merits and Article VIII.2.01 CCJA\n\n222.\n\nToto, on the other hand, could legitimately expect Lebanon to resolve owners\u2019 obstructions, whenever they occurred, and to mitigate their adverse impact on the works.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted, when considering the alleged violation of Article 2 of the Treaty, that Lebanon did take action to put an end to the obstructions, and that Toto accepted an extension of the Contract, which was, *inter alia,* granted because of the temporary obstructed access to some parcels.\n\n224.\n\nMoreover, only the frustration of legitimate expectations which upsets the stability of the legal or business framework, the fair and equitable treatment standard, or the rights acquired under domestic law, should be protected under Article 3.1 of the Treaty. Toto did not prove that the owners\u2019 obstructions have upset any of such elements.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal did not find evidence that Toto had legitimate expectations with regard to the removal of the obstructing owners, which were frustrated by Lebanon in a way leading to unfair and inequitable treatment of Toto\u2019s investment in violation of Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n*c) Article 4*\n--------------\n\n226.\n\nToto argued that, by not taking action to prevent and put an end to the owners\u2019 obstructions, Lebanon failed to provide its investment with full protection and security as prescribed by Article 4.1 of the Treaty.\n\n227.\n\nLebanon objects by stating that Toto has not established Lebanon\u2019s breach of the Treaty\u2019s standard of security. The obligation of full protection and security is not a strict liability standard, but requires due diligence.157 Toto did not submit supporting evidence establishing that Lebanon had been negligent in its actions in relation to the owners\u2019 obstructions.\n\nBy way of example, Noble Ventures v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/111, Award, October 12, 2005, paragraph 164 (Exhibit R90), and Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. the United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award, May 29, 2003, paragraph 177 (Exhibit R91).\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that, under Article 4.1 of the Treaty, Lebanon had a duty to provide full protection and security to investors. However, the International Court of Justice in ***Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.(ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*** found that the provision in a treaty for \"*constant protection and security cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed\".*158 In ***Noble Ventures v. Romania159*** an ICSID Tribunal, referring to the ELSI decision, held that workers on strike did not pose a threat to the investor even though they occupied the investor\u2019s business premises. In ***Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,*** another ICSID Tribunal held that the obligation to grant full security does not address all kinds of impairment, but only those which affect the physical integrity of the investment against the use of force.160\n\nICJ Reports 1989, p.15, paragrah 108.\n\nNoble Ventures v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/111, Award, October 12, 2005, paragraphs 155 and 166.\n\nSaluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic, (Permanent Court of Arbitration), Partial Award, March 17, 2006, paragraphs 483- 484 (Exhibit R92).\n\n229.\n\nIn the present case, the temporary obstructions of some expropriated owners did not amount to an impairment which affected the physical integrity of the investment. Moreover, Toto did not demonstrate that Lebanon could have taken preventive or remedial action that it failed to take, and that it acted negligently in relation to the owners\u2019 obstructions.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, under the owners\u2019 obstructions head of claim, Lebanon has not acted in breach of Article 4.1 of the Treaty.\n\n**4. Faulty Design Due to Inappropriate Standards**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nToto argues that Lebanon, on various occasions, has been late in submitting or approving the necessary designs and plans.\n\n232.\n\nLebanon objects by saying that the Tribunal has excluded from its jurisdiction errors of, and delays in, the processing of the design, and that the Decision on Jurisdiction, which is final and cannot be revised, has *res judicata* and cannot be revisited.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, has indeed ruled that erroneous design relates to the contractual obligations of the Engineer and/or the CEGP, and afterwards the CDR, and does not involve the use of sovereign authority. It cannot therefore be the subject of this arbitration.\n\n234.\n\nToto argues that the design of the originally conceived Viaduct 25.1, as submitted in the tender, would make traffic circulation unsafe, and did not comply with the required anti-seismic standards. In Toto\u2019s view, the imposition of adequate safety and anti-seismic standards is a matter of *puissance publique* and is thus covered by the Treaty.\n\n235.\n\nToto states that, on March 12, 1998, it asked the CEGP for the authorization to change the design, and that it took Lebanon ten months, *i.e.,* until December 23, 1998, to accept the amended design which complied with the proper safety and anti-seismic standards.161 According to Toto, even though it is the one who took the initiative to change the design, the safety aspects of the design, which Lebanon overlooked, as so Toto argues, were exclusively in the hands of Lebanon. Lebanon\u2019s failure to act promptly on this matter thus prejudiced Toto\u2019s investment. Lebanon did not grant Toto the fair and equitable treatment prescribed by the Treaty.162 Toto explained that, when it decided to engage into the Project, it had expected Lebanon to incorporate the proper safety and anti-seismic standards in the tender documents. For Toto, Lebanon\u2019s faulty design delayed the execution of the Project and made Toto incur additional costs.163 Consequently, Toto considers that Lebanon has breached Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty.\n\nExhibit MM46: The letter only said that the alternative straight bridge was \u2018better\u2019 than the initial adjudicated *\u2018gourbe\u2019* with regard to the traffic safety and security as well as to earthquakes handling.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits dated August 8, 2010, paragraphs 90-96\n\nClaimants Memorial on the Merits dated January 29, 2010, paragraph 203\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal reasserts its position that it does not assume jurisdiction over claims which are contractual in nature. The Tribunal\u2019s duty is restricted to assessing whether Lebanon, as *puissance publique,* breached Articles 2 and 3.1 of the Treaty as a result of the submission, by the CEGP, of a design that did not incorporate the safety and anti-seismic standards which were later implemented in Toto\u2019s amended design.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal did not find that Toto established that the initial standards applied by the CEGP to Viaduct 25.1 were wrong; or that the selection of safety standards for a construction project was a matter of sovereign authority. Toto did not show to the satisfaction of the Tribunal how Lebanon, by choosing the standards originally to be followed for the construction of Viaduct 25.1, has breached international law, and more specifically, Articles 2 and 3.1 of the Treaty.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the inappropriate Project\u2019s design alleged by Toto with respect to safety standards for Viaduct 25.1 does not lead to a violation of the Treaty by Lebanon.\n\n**5. Change in the Regulatory Framework**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nToto argues that the Contract implied that the Project would be subject to the Lebanese tax legislation in effect at the time the Contract was entered. Article 1-13 of the CCJA invited Toto to examine all the tax laws applicable when it submitted its offer, which for Toto means that CEGP had committed not to change that law. Despite such commitment, Lebanese custom duties on cement, building materials, diesel, and steel unreasonably increased in Toto\u2019s view, thus increasing Toto\u2019s costs. For instance, diesel price allegedly increased about 40%, and government duties on cement more than doubled. For Toto, Lebanon failed to maintain favourable economic and legal conditions, and the changes in tax and customs duties legislation amount to breach of Article 2 of the Treaty. They moreover constitute a breach of the requirement of fair and equitable treatment provided for in Article 3 of the Treaty.\n\n240.\n\nLebanon acknowledges that here have been increases in customs and tax duties, but contends that there also have been price decreases which Toto failed to mention. Lebanon adds that Toto had agreed not to expect increases in custom duties and taxes to be compensated: the price adjustment formula of Article III-04 CCJA, to which Toto had agreed, included several parameters, but did not take into account increases in custom duties and taxes. Toto moreover, at that time, has explicitly recognized that it was not entitled to compensation for increased diesel prices.164\n\nToto\u2019s letter dated September 4, 2000, Exhibit R104.\n\n241.\n\nFor Lebanon, Article I-I3 CCJA only aimed at making clear that Toto had to pay all taxes or duties prescribed by Lebanese law. Under Article III-4 CCJA, the submitted unit prices could be adjusted with time, but a change in taxes or duties as such was not included in the formula to amend the prices. Moreover, the Contract neither contained a stabilisation clause, nor provided that custom duties and taxes would not be changed. Lebanon\u2019s position is that, under such circumstances, Toto could not have legitimate expectations to be compensated for price increases beyond what the Contract provided for.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that fair and equitable treatment does not, in the circumstances prevailing in Lebanon at the time, entail a guarantee to the investor that tax laws and customs duties would not be changed.\n\n243.\n\nIn ***Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania,*** the arbitrators recognized the right of States to modify their laws:\n\n*\"It is each State\u2019s undeniable right and privilege to exercise its sovereign legislative power. A state has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at its own discretion. Save for the existence of an agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause or otherwise, there is nothing objectionable about the amendment brought to the regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its investment. As a matter of fact, any businessman or investor knows that laws will evolve over time. What is prohibited however is for a State to act unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power.\"165*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, September 7, 2007, paragraphs 331-333.\n\n244.\n\nIn the absence of a stabilisation clause or similar commitment, which were not granted in the present case, changes in the regulatory framework would be considered as breaches of the duty to grant full protection and fair and equitable treatment only in case of a drastic or discriminatory change in the essential features of the transaction. Toto failed to establish that Lebanon, in changing taxes and customs duties, brought about such a drastic or discriminatory consequence. The additional cost resulting from increased taxes and custom duties is small compared to the overall amount of the Project. The changes to the custom duties and taxes on cement, diesel, and construction material were moreover applicable to foreign investors as well as Lebanese nationals. This cannot amount to discriminatory or unreasonable actions towards Toto.\n\n245.\n\nIn ***Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania,*** the arbitrators concluded that the circumstances in a country in transition could not justify the legitimate expectations as regards the stability of the investment\u2019s environment. Rather, the investor was considered to have taken the business risk to invest, notwithstanding the possible legal and political instability.166 Likewise, the post-civil war situation in Lebanon, with substantial economic challenges and colossal reconstruction efforts, did not justify legal expectations that custom duties would remain unchanged.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, September 7, 2007, paragraphs 335-336.\n\n246.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Tribunal finds that there is no violation of Articles 2 or 3 of the Treaty by the Republic of Lebanon with respect to the increase of taxes and customs duties.\n\n**VII. DECISION ON COMPENSATION**\n---------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nToto claims in this arbitration an amount of L.P. 16,040,766.9769 (equivalent to USD 10,694,000) as compensation for additional costs incurred because of the 1164-day extension in the works supposedly caused by Lebanon\u2019s alleged breaches of the Treaty.167 Toto assumed that the delay has been exclusively caused by Lebanon\u2019s alleged breaches, thereby claiming compensation for all its operational expenses, without further specification of labour, plant and material costs caused by the specific alleged delays, and without comparing these additional expenses to the originally envisaged expenses.\n\nThis delay was the sum of a delay of 799 days till December 31, 2001 when the Project was substantially handed over and a further delay of 365 days with less personnel and facilities till December 31, 2002, when the Project effectively terminated. This amount included also compensation for the price increase of bitumen and aggregates as well as the study and design costs for drainage and stability (Exhibits MM49-51).\n\n248.\n\nToto has not established how many of the 1164 days were caused by Lebanon\u2019s alleged respective Treaty breaches.168 Some delays were also due to Toto (e.g., by not bringing in specific equipment and not arranging the molds on time), by bad weather or because of slippery soil.169\n\nSome delays, due to CEGP, such as changing from calcareous to basaltic gravel (Exhibits MM90-A and MM90-B), were clearly outside the Treaty protection.\n\nSee Export Report of Mr. Steve Huyghe, dated June 15, 2011 and Minutes of Meeting October 19, 2000, Exhibit 39.\n\n249.\n\nToto did not specify which delay was supposedly caused by which alleged breach of the Treaty. Neither did it sufficiently establish the causality between the alleged breach of the Treaty and the loss sustained. For instance, Toto recognized that expropriations were not on the \u2018critical path\u2019 for the construction of Viaduct 25.1170; in fact, even when parcels were not yet expropriated, work on the Viaduct 25.1 could be undertaken.171\n\nLetter to CEGP dated 18 November 1999, Exhibit MM109.\n\nE.g., the construction of Viaduct 25.1 did not have to wait until all the parcels of the new alignment had been formally expropriated and delivered as Toto had made prior arrangements with the owners to start work on their lands.\n\n250.\n\nToto also did not prove to what extent the workshop, which was moved to another area because the originally-foreseen area was occupied by Syrian troops, was an actual cause of delay.\n\n251.\n\nIrrespective of the lack of evidence, for the reasons stated in this decision, the Tribunal does not find that Lebanon has breached its Treaty obligations towards Toto, and as a result, no compensation is due to Toto. Because the Tribunal finds that no compensation is owed by Lebanon to Toto, it is not relevant that Toto also failed to prove the damages caused by the alleged Treaty breaches.\n\n252.\n\nIt is also not relevant that Toto, although it has described its claim as one for cumulative delay as well as for disruption, did not, independently from the delay, analyse the disruption in the works, which does not necessarily result in delay, and the additional costs, resulting from such disruption.\n\n253.\n\nToto has additionally claimed L.P. 833,386,120 (equivalent to USD 545,590) because during the extension period of the Project, legislative changes led to an increase in the prices of cement, diesel and steel.\n\n254.\n\nHere again, regardless of the fact that the cement should have been ordered in June 1999 as the Contract required,172 that diesel prices and consumption are not supported by documentary proof, and that Toto could have purchased the steel earlier, the Tribunal finds that Lebanon owes no compensation to Toto because there were no breaches of the Treaty by Lebanon.\n\nUnder paragraph 2 of Article VII of the CPT, Toto had *\"to send to the engineer within one month as of the notification of the project\u2019s approval, a copy of the letters by virtue of which it had ordered cement''*\n\n255.\n\nToto, furthermore claims (i) L.P. 807,799,237 (equivalent to USD 538,000) as interest on payments received after the due date, compounded interest at LIBOR rate on unpaid amounts up to the date of effective payment, (ii) L.P. 8,562,253.000(equivalent to USD 5,980,000) as compensation for the loss of opportunities, and (iii) L.P. 6,048,403.161(equivalent to USD 4,010,877) as compensation for moral damages. However, as Lebanon has not been found in breach of Treaty obligations, the claims for all such heads of compensation are dismissed.\n\n**VIII. DECISION ON COSTS**\n---------------------------\n\n256.\n\nEach of the Parties has submitted that the other should be ordered to bear all the costs of the arbitration and reimburse the amounts incurred by it in this case.\n\n257.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.\"*\n\n258.\n\nUnder Article 61(2), the Tribunal is granted discretion in making its determination with respect to the allocation of costs.\n\n259.\n\nIn the present case, Lebanon\u2019s objection to jurisdiction has been partially rejected, but the Claimant\u2019s claims are dismissed on the merits, not because Lebanon\u2019s behavior was irreproachable, but because the actions and omissions of Lebanon, some of which could amount to breaches of the Contract, were not proven to be breaches of the Treaty.\n\n260.\n\nThere are good reasons therefore, for the Tribunal to decide that the costs and expenses should be shared by Toto and Lebanon. For that reason, and having taken into account all the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal concludes that the Parties shall bear on an equal basis the fees and expenses of the members of this Arbitral Tribunal, and of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, and that each party shall bear the legal fees and expenses incurred by it in relation to this case.\n\n**IX. OPERATIVE PART**\n----------------------\n\n261.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal unanimously decides and orders as follows:\n\n(a) For the reasons set forth in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction of September 4, 2009 (which is incorporated by reference), and in the present Award, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claims for breaches of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Treaty.\n\n(b) The Tribunal declares that the Respondent did not breach its obligations under Article 2 and/or Article 3 of the Treaty. The Respondent also did not fail to comply with the full protection and security standard of Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\n(c) Accordingly, all substantive claims of the Claimant are dismissed.\n\n(d) The parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares.\n\n(e) Each party shall bear its own costs and legal fees."}]}
