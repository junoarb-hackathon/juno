STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n--------------------------\n\n55.\n\nAs previously indicated, the Parties submitted a Joint Factual Chronology in advance of the hearing, and indicated that this was without prejudice to their respective positions and to disputed facts that may not have been included therein. The Tribunal includes this Joint Factual Chronology as Appendix I, and refers to it when necessary below.\n\n**A. EVENTS UP TO THE REINSTATEMENT OF MR. OVCHARENKO**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Creation of Ukrtatnafta**\n----------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe present arbitration concerns the lawfulness under the Russia-Ukraine BIT of measures undertaken by the Respondent in relation to CJSC Ukrtatnafta (\"Ukrtatnafta\"). The creation of Ukrtatnafta is best understood against the background of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\n57.\n\nDuring the days of the Soviet Union, the highly viscose and sulphurous oil extracted in Tatarstan16 was delivered to a refinery in Kremenchug (the JSC \"Kremenchugnefteorgsintez\" or the \"Kremenchug refinery\") through a direct pipeline from Tatarstan to Ukraine.17 As the dissolution of the Soviet Union caused Tatarstan and Ukraine to become separate States, the governments of these countries entered into the Ukrtatnafta Treaty in 1995 and established Ukrtatnafta,18 a joint venture that was to own and operate the Kremenchug refinery and supply refined oil products to Ukrainian and international markets.19\n\nMemorial, \u00b613.\n\nMemorial, \u00b613.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 12; Counter-Memorial, \u00b651 35.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 14,\n\n58.\n\nThe Ukrtatnafta Treaty was signed by representatives of both Tatarstan and Ukraine.20 It was not, however, ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament21 in light of the Ukrainian legal regime that differentiates between treaties and international agreements, as further explained below. There is no information on the record as to whether the Treaty was formally ratified in Tatarstan.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b613\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 154 n. 320.\n\n59.\n\nUkrtatnafta was registered as a Ukrainian closed joint stock corporation22 and intended to represent Tatarstan and Ukrainian interests on a 50/50 or parity basis.23 As set out in the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement,24 the share of Ukraine was mostly allocated to the State Property Fund of Ukraine (\"SPFU\")25 while the share of Tatarstan was split between the government26 and the Claimant.27\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 12; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 35.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 12; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 35; Transcript (18 March 2013), 18:23-25, 154:14-18.\n\nAgreement on the Creation and Operation of Ukrtatnafta Transnational Financial and Industrial Petroleum Company of 1995 (the \"Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement\") (C-121).\n\nThe exact percentage is 49,986%.

Note that Respondent calls this the State Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan on the Management of State Property; see Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 38.\n\nExact percentage is 20.02% share. Six other shareholders received the remaining fraction of shares. As set out in the Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 38, the remaining six shareholders from the Tatarstan side are Production Association \"Tatneftprom\" (with a.08% share), JSC \"Tatneftekhiminvestkhoiding\" (with a.014% share), JSC \"Suvar\" (with a.014% share), Joint Venture \"Djoy - Tatneftproin TR Communications LTD\" (city of Almetevsk) (with a,014% share), and Bank \"Devon-Credit\"(with a,014% share), and KSC \"TINK\" (with a.012% share).\n\n60.\n\nBoth the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement28 and the related Presidential Decree No. 704/94 (\"Decree No. 704/94\")29 of the President of Ukraine indicated that Ukraine would contribute the Kremenchug refinery to Ukrtatnafta, which the SPFU did in 1996.30\n\nMemorial, \u00b617, *citing to* the Article 5(2) of the 1995 Incorporation Agreement (C-121).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 29; Memorial, \u00b6 17; both citing to the Decree of the President of Ukraine No. 704/94 \"On the Establishment of Transnational Financial and Industrial Oil Company Ukrtatnafta\", November 29.1994 (REX-5).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 40; Transcript (18 March 2013), 154:18-21.\n\n61.\n\nWhile the Annex to the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement stated that the Claimant would contribute fixed assets for the operation of specified oil wells to Ukrtatnafta,31 the Ukrtatnafta shareholders, in a General Shareholders Meeting held on 10 June 1998, authorized the Claimant to contribute US$ 31 million instead.32 This had the effect of reducing the Claimant\u2019s stake in Ukrtatnafta to 8,613% from the approximately 20% share contemplated in 1995.33 Zenit Bank transferred US$ 30 million to Ukrtatnafta,34 and was replaced by the Claimant as a shareholder on 19 July 2000, as authorized by a General Shareholders Meeting held on 23 May 2000.35 The Claimant paid the remaining US$ 1 million directly to Ukrtatnafta on 11 August 2000.36\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 38; Transcript (18 March 2013), 14:5-9.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 21; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 46; Transcript (18 March 2013), 14:19-21.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 21; Transcript (18 March 2013), 14:21.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 61; Second Memorial, \u00b6 224.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 23.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b663.\n\n62.\n\nAmRuz Trading AG (\"AmRuz\"), a Swiss company, was admitted as a shareholder in Ukrtatnafta during a General Shareholders Meeting held on 10 June 1998.37 0n 1 June 1999, Ukrtatnafta, AmRuz, and Seagroup International Inc. (\"Seagroup\"), the American parent company of AmRuz, executed share purchase agreements in which AmRuz and Seagroup used promissory notes to obtain a collective 18% share in Ukrtatnafta.38 Specifically, AmRuz tendered 30 promissory notes and Seagroup tendered 35 promissory notes for their shares at US$ 1 million per note and, in the case of Seagroup, one more promissory note at US$ 845,132.\u201939 These share purchase agreements were approved in the 10 June 1999 General Shareholders Meeting,40 winch is also when Seagroup was admitted as a shareholder in Ukrtatnafta.41 These share purchase agreements were amended in May 2000 to give AmRuz and Seagroup four years to redeem the promissory notes.42 In December 2007, the Claimant acquired an interest in 100% of Seagroup and 49.6% of AmRuz.43, for a total price of US$ 81 million. Roughly at the same time (April 2009), Korsan acquired a 1.15% interest in Ukrtatnafta for the sum of US$ 2 million.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 15.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 22; Transcript (18 March 2013), 16:9-12.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 110.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 161:19-23.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 19\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 247, referring to Addendum No. 1 to Sales and Purchase Contract No. 02-1-99 of June 1, 1999, and Addendum No. 1 to Sales and Purchase Contract No. 1747/12 of June 1, 1999 (C-16 and C-17); Transcript (18 March 2013), 162:2-5.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6227; Transcript (18 March 2013), 18:16-21.\n\n**2. The Dismissal of Mr. Pavel Ovcharenko in 2004**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Undisputed Facts**\n------------------------\n\n63.\n\nOn 21 September 2004, the Supervisory Board\u2014which was tasked with overseeing the activities of the Management Board, the implementation of shareholder resolutions, and the protection of shareholder rights44\u2014dismissed Mr. Pavel Ovcharenko as Chairman of the Management Board and replaced him with Mr. Sergei Glushko.45 Mr. Glushko was the appointee of Naftogaz to the Management Board, and his appointment was specifically proposed by Mr. Yuri Boyko, the head of Naftogaz who later become the Minister of Fuel and Energy of Ukraine.46\n\nMemorial, \u00b626.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98, referring to Minutes No. 5/N/2004 of the 21 September 2004 Meeting of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Supervisory Board of Ukrtatnafta (C-5).: Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 77; Transcript (18 March 2013), 20:15-16.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6235; Transcript (27 March 2013),.78:18-22.\n\n64.\n\nMr. Ovcharenko filed an application for reinstatement on 4 October 209447 on the basis that Ukrtatnafta had breached Article 159 of the Civil Code and Articles 40 and 41 of the Labor Code.48 The Avtozavodsky District Court granted this application on 9 November 2004 (\"9 November 2004 Judgment\")49\n\nMemorial, \u00b699; Counter-Memorial, \u00b679.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b679.\n\nMemorial, \u00b699; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 79; Transcript (18 March 2013), 20:16-20.\n\n65.\n\nMr. Ovcharenko was reinstated as Chairman of the Management Board on 11 November 2004. In the General Shareholders Meeting that was held the next day, the Ukrtatnafta shareholders approved the Supervisory Board\u2019s 21 September 2004 dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko, and instructed the Management Board to consider the reinstatement of Mr. Glushko.50\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 101; Joint Factual Chronology, \u00b654; Transcript (18 March 2013), 20:25 to 21:1-6.\n\n66.\n\nThree years later, on 5 September 2007, Mr. Ovcharenko applied to the Kriukivskiy District Court for interim measures and a \"supplementary decision\" in connection with the 9 November 2004 Judgment, which he alleged did not specify the necessary enforcement actions.51\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 82.\n\n67.\n\nOn 26 September 2007, the Kriukivskiy District Court issued the requested interim measures (\"26 September 2007 Interim Measures\") and supplementary decision (\"26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision\", and together with 26 September 2007 Interim Measures, \"26 September 2007 Decisions\")52 Noting that the 9 November 2004 Judgment had not yet been enforced, the Court issued the interim measures pursuant to Article 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, and authorized Mr. Ovcharenko to proceed with its enforcement53 The Court further noted that the enforcement of the 9 November 2004 Judgment was rendered impossible by the absence in this judgment of the necessary actions for an enforcement, and thereby found \"lawful grounds\" for issuing a supplementary decision. The supplementary decision authorized Mr. Ovcharenko to perform the functions of the Chairman of the Management Board, to access the Ukrtatnafta premises, and to remove obstacles to his resuming control.54\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 102; Counter-Memorial, 82-83; Transcript (18 March 2013), 22:1-9.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6| 104; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 82.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 103; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 83.\n\n68.\n\nIt was allegedly pursuant to the 26 September 2007 Decisions that the activities of 19 October 2007 took place.\n\n**(b) Disputed Facts**\n----------------------\n\ni.

According to the Claimant, this case exemplifies a \"raider\" action, which it defines as \"the combination of a criminal seizure of property by an organized group and the involvement of the State through the issuance of unlawful court decisions, the assistance of enforcement officers of the State and the support of the State actors in the illegal acts.\"55 The Claimant identifies \"Privat Group,\" a company headed by the Ukrainian businessman Mr. Kolomoisky, as the corporate raider56 It notes that Privat Group, through its affiliate Korsan LLC, acquired a \"toehold\" in Ukrtatnafta in late 2006, in the form of a 1% shareholding interest that \"g[a]ve [Mr. Kolomoisky] a little foot in the door [... to] systematically take over the Tatarstan side of the company.\"57\n\nMemorial, \u00b653.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 80-90; Transcript (18 March 2013), 17:6.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 5; Transcript (18 March 2013), 17:7-16. The Tribunal notes a small discrepancy between the Memorial, according to which the shares were acquired in 2007, and the Claimant\u2019s explanation at the hearing that the shares were acquired \"at the end of the year 2006\".\n\n70.\n\nNoting that Article 99(3) of the Civil Code gives Ukrtatnafta shareholders the unqualified right to determine the management of the company,58 the Claimant contends that there was no basis to reinstate Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of the Management Board once the shareholders had decided against him in the General Shareholders Meeting held on 12 November 2004.59 In view of this, the Claimant contends that the theories of labor law on which the Respondent relies for its argument on the invalidity of the removal of Mr. Ovcharenko are irrelevant.60 The Claimant further alleges that this removal by the shareholders supersedes Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s dismissal by the Supervisory Board on 21 September 2004 and the 9 November 2004 Judgment ordering his reinstatement.61 The Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that Article 99(3) of the Civil Code relates only to the \"temporary suspension\" of employees,62 and identifies the \"temporary suspension\" provision to which the Respondent refers as Article 46 of the Labor Code.63 It stresses that Article 99(3) of the Civil Code refers to the fundamental power of a company to remove and permanently terminate the mandate of the Chairman of the Board of Management,64\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b627; Transcript (18 March 2013), 76:8-11.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b631 **.**\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b631; Transcript (18 March 2013), 20:22-24.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b626,279.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b627-28.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b629.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 28; Transcript (18 March 2013), 21:16-21.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n71.\n\nAs a preliminary point, and as will be discussed in further detail below, the Respondent contends that Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement is irrelevant to the Claimant\u2019s case in this arbitration. It also notes that the Claimant has \"failed to show that [Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s] reinstatement was illegally facilitated by Ukraine in any way.\"65\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 55.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Ukrtatnafta shareholders could not have dismissed Mr. Ovcharenko during the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on 12 November 2004 because his \"reinstatement\" the previous day was a \"sham.\"66 First, the reinstatement did not fulfill the requirement in Article 77 of the Ukrainian Law on \"Executive Proceedings\" and in the then Charter of Ukrtatnafta that the Supervisory Board cancel its own dismissal order.67 Second, Mr. Ovcharenko was impeded from assuming his position as Chairman, given that he was not notified of his reinstatement, which in any case lasted for only a day.68 Third, Mr. Glushko was referred to as \"chairman\" several times during the 12 November 2004 General Shareholders Meeting.69 And, fourth, no bailiff had issued a resolution confirming the reinstatement as was the usual and proper practice.70 The Respondent further posits that Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Supervisory Board, Management Board (save for Mr. Glushko), and shareholders may not even have known about the 9 November 2004 decision of the Avtozadovsky District Court at that time.71\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 273; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 55.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 160; Second Counter-Memorial, 269-270; Transcript (19 March 2013), 35:5-20, 35:23-25 to 36:1-2.\n\nCounter-Memorial,\u00b6 161; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6269, 271; Transcript (19 March 2013), 36:21-25.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6162; Second counter-memorial, \u00b6 272; Transcript (19 March 2013), 36:6-20.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 163.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial,\u2019 \u00b6 55.\n\n73.\n\nBut even assuming the validity of the 11 November 2004 reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, the Respondent argues that the Ukrtatnafta shareholders\u2019 dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko on 12 November 2004 violated provisions of the Ukrainian Labor Code.72 First, in violation of Article 36(8), the shareholders dismissed Mr. Ovcharenko without cause\u2014that is, without indicating a ground under the Labor Code or the contract for his dismissal. Instead, the shareholders merely approved the Supervisory Board\u2019s 21 September 2004 termination decision, which the 9 November 2004 Judgment had established to be inadequate.73\u2019 The Respondent further states that the Claimant conflates the proposition that the shareholders can dismiss the chairman of the management board, with which the Respondent agrees,74 with the separate notion, which is inapplicable in this case, that such dismissal does not require a showing of good cause.75 And second, Mr. Ovcharenko was dismissed before his term expired, thereby violating Article 36(2), which authorizes the dismissal of an employee once his or her employment contract ends.76 Moreover, the courts could not have confirmed the (re-)dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko as lawful on grounds other than those initially advanced to justify his termination.77\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, 274-275; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 55.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 277; Transcript (19 March 2013), 39:1-5, 40:7-14; Transcript (27 March 2013), 130:15-20.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 130:13-14.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 132:15-18.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 278.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 279.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates that Article 99(3) of the Civil Code, which it stresses is a \"sufficiently unclear and ambiguous\" provision because it was newly passed then,78 does not authorize tire permanent dismissal of employees and relates only to their temporary suspension.79 Alternatively, the Respondent contends that this provision requires the dismissal of an employee to be predicated on a finding of cause, which was not the case here.80 The Respondent further points out that there is no evidence that Ukrtatnafta ever presented arguments based on this provision in prior court proceedings.81\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 42:10-18.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6281,284-287.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6288.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 41:16-25 to 42:1-2.\n\n75.\n\nFrom all of the above, the Respondent concludes that \"Mr. Ovcharenko had, at the very minimum, a tenable claim to reinstatement....\"82\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b655.\n\nii. The Kriukivskiy Court\u2019s Decision to Proceed *Ex Parte*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the decision of the Kriukivskiy Court to proceed *ex parte* on the basis of Article 76 of the Code of Civil Procedure was invalid.83 It argues that the Court disregarded the requirement in Section 129 of the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, No. 1155 of 17 August 2002 (\"Section 129\") that the signature of an authorized representative of Ukrtatnafta establish proof of service process, permitting this to be established by an unsigned postal note instead.84 The Claimant recalls that the resolutions to enforce the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision Were sent by ordinary mail and posits there was no attempt to verify their delivery because \"the goal was to create a legal pretext to physically take over the refinery.\"85 The Claimant also alleges that the Court must have known that raiders frequently use postal notes to fabricate receipt of service of process.86\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6376.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20,280.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 24:2-9.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 20; Transcript (18 March 2013), 52:18-20.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant notes that a further violation of process occurred when the Court, in its 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision, authorized remedies that Mr. Ovcharenko had not originally raised in pleadings leading to the 9 November 2004 Judgment.87\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 21,280.\n\n78.\n\nIn its analysis of this court decision and all others, the Claimant highlights the corruption of the Ukrainian judicial system and notes that to \"do a theft by law,\" one would \"classical[ly]\" apply for an *ex parte* order in Ukrainian courts which would be enforced against the absent party.88\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 23:22-25, 157:9-14.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Respondent distinguishes between the general assertion that the Ukrainian judicial system suffers from instances of corruption (which the Respondent does not directly reject)89 and specific allegations of corruption in respect of the judicial decisions involved in the present case.90 It stresses that the Tribunal should focus on the latter and not the former.91 Moreover, the Respondent characterizes as \"staggering\" the degree of corruption that would have had to take place to support the Claimant\u2019s position that a majority of the judicial decisions underlying this case, many of which were the focus of public interest and scrutiny,92 were wrongly decided.93 It further remarks that the Claimant seems to take the position that any decision favoring it was rightly decided, whereas those that go against its interests were influenced by corruption and therefore wrong.94 In response, the Respondent points out that the issues that were the subject of the relevant court decisions were susceptible to different resolutions, and the fact that different resolutions were reached highlights the independence of the judiciary.95 It states that \"there was no presentation during the hearing and there is no evidence in the record of specific corruption infecting any of these particular court decisions, except to the extent that Tatneft says that it doesn\u2019t like the reasoning in some of the decisions, and it finds that circumstantial evidence.\"96\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 76:25 to 77:1-3.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 157:15-21.\n\nTranscript (IS March 2013), 158:1-7.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 77:8-19.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 76:15-22, 77:3-7.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 90:15-19.

The Issuance of Interim Measures under Article 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Kriukivskiy Court had no plausible basis for issuing the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures because, in violation of Article 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the difficulty or impossibility of enforcing the 9 November 2004 Judgment ordering the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko was not established.102 In the Claimant\u2019s view, Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated on 11 November 2004.103 The Claimant also points out that the 9 November 2004 Judgment had become binding only on 29 August 2007, as it had been subject to numerous retrials before then.104 From this, the Claimant notes that Mr. Ovcharenko waited just weeks before the 26 September 2007 decisions to enforce the judgment.105\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 19,276-277.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 277.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 17,277.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 18,277.\n\n83.\n\nBut even assuming that the enforcement of the 9 November 2004 Judgment was difficult or impossible (which the Claimant denies), the Claimant posits that Mr. Ovcharenko deliberately chose not to request assistance from the district court in enforcing this decision, as would have been proper, and instead applied for interim measures to bypass procedural protections.106\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 19.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the misapplication of the Kriukivskiy Court of Article 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure violated Articles 212 and 213 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which require courts to subject the existing evidence to a full and objective analysis and to issue decisions that are properly motivated or supported by an investigation of the circumstances underlying the parties\u2019 claims.107\n\nSecond Memorial, U 375.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the protracted failure of Ukrtatnafta to comply with the 9 November 2004 Judgment\u2014from either its issuance date, which is when it became enforceable, or from 29 August 2007, which is when it became binding108\u2014justified the issuance of the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures under Article 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.109 The Respondent alleges that Mr. Ovcharenko had twice been unsuccessful in his attempts to enforce this judgment, which, among other things, justified the Kriukivskiy Court\u2019s decision to grant provisional relief.110 The Respondent also points out that decisions by more than half a dozen courts evaluating the lawfulness of the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko preceded the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures, and that the Claimant has not alleged that it was precluded from participating in these proceedings.111 Hence there is no evidence that the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures were not reasonably tenable under Ukrainian law or otherwise issued in bad faith.112\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 260 n. 456, 261. The Respondent also clarifies that this factual proposition was not pleaded as breaches of the \"complete\" and unconditional legal protection\" and \"full protection and security\" standards, which would make it irrelevant to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Respondent had breached the Russia-Ukraine BIT, but states that it is addressing this point for the sake of completeness.

The Interim Measures As a Form of Post-judgment Enforcement Order\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures were inappropriate and were used to enforce the 9 November 2004 Judgment that, after three years, had become moot.114 By issuing the interim measures decision as an *ex parte* order and by declar ing it immediately enforceable, the Kriukivsky Court deprived the Claimant of the opportunity to resist its enforcement.115 The Court thus negated the due process protections that the Claimant would have enjoyed had this judgment been enforced according to Articles 24 and 25 of the Ukrainian Enforcement Law.116 The Claimant also submits that the court decision granting the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures was materially unfair and inequitable since the only stated reason for its issuance was that the 9 November 2004 Judgment had not yet been executed.117\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b622,278; Transcript (18 March 2013), 51:1-6.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 51:7-16.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6376.\n\nTranscript (IS March 2013), 51:1, 17-22.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the 26 September 2007 decision on interim Measures was issued as a form of provisional relief to secure the enforcement of the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision, which was issued half an hour after the 2007 Interim Measures even if the 2007 Supplementary Decision did not mention it by name.118\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 260 n. 456.\n\nv. The Proportionality of the 26 September 2007 Decisions\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n89.\n\nEven assuming that Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s rights had been violated (which the Claimant denies), the Claimant alleges that the 26 September 2007 Decisions were disproportionate to any such violations, in contravention of Article 152(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The 2007 Supplementary Decision placed Mr. Ovcharenko in a position to make far-reaching decisions in relation to Ukrtatnafta\u2019s operational activities, including decisions that were reserved for the Management Board and that required the approval of the Supervisory Board under Ukrtatnafta\u2019s constituent instruments.119 In the Claimant\u2019s view, there was no legal basis for the Kriukivskiy Court, in its 26 September 2007 Decisions, to expand Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s powers, as a monetary remedy could have made Mr. Ovcharenko whole and he could have returned to the court for assistance in the enforcement of such remedy.120\n\nTranscript (IS March 2013), 51:23-25 to 52:1-6.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 377.\n\n*The Respondent \u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision was authorized by Article 220(l)(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, because the 9 November 2004 Judgment did not specify the necessary orders for the reinstatement of Mr, Ovcharenko.121\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 262-263.\n\n91.\n\nAs previously stated, the Respondent points out that the Claimant never identified which new. powers the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision allegedly granted Mr. Ovcharenko, and observes that this decision only identified basic attributes of the position of Chairman of the Management Board122 and spelled out the legal consequences of Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement, which is precisely the relief that Mr, Ovcharenko had sought.123\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6265,\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6265 n 466.\n\n**3. Events of 19 October 2007**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Undisputed Facts**\n------------------------\n\n92.\n\nFollowing the proceedings before the Kriukivskiy Court, Mr. Ovcharenko sought enforcement of the 26 September 2007 Decisions,\n\n93.\n\nTo that end, on 12 October 2007, Mr. Yevgeniy Pryshchepa, a bailiff employed by the State Executive Office within the Ministry of Justice,124 sent Ukrtatnafta by ordinary mail three resolutions that initiated the process for enforcing writs of execution connected with the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Decision and imposed a deadline of 18 October 2007 for compliance with them.125 - On 18 October 2007, Mr. Pryshchepa sent a fourth resolution to implement the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures ruling.126\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 290.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 290.\n\n*Id.*\n\n94.\n\nOn 19 October 2007, Mr. Pryshchepa and Mr. Ovcharenko (who was accompanied by other persons) entered the premises of Ukrtatnafta. While the Parties dispute the precise nature of what occurred during the course of this day, it is clear that the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of the Management Board was accomplished by that afternoon.\n\n95.\n\nOn 22 October 2007, Mr. Glushko commenced a lawsuit, which would later become Case 2-336/2008, against Mr. Ovcharenko and Ukrtatnafta before the Avtozavodsky District Court of Kremenchug, to request that Mr, Ovcharenko be ordered to cease exercising the functions of the Chairman of the Management Board and that Mr, Glushko be reinstated in this position,127 on the basis that Mr. Ovcharenko had allegedly taken control of Ukrtatnafta through an illegal attack premised on a court judgment that had already been complied with.128 Finding that the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko was lawful, the Court dismissed this lawsuit on 18 January 2008.129 On 19 March 2008, the Poltava Region Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal of Mr. Glushko.130 The Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected his cassation appeal on 5 November 2008.131\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 95.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6150.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 115.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 123.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 143.\n\n**(b) Disputed Facts**\n----------------------\n\n96.\n\nAs a general matter, the Parties disagree on the significance of the events of 19 October 2007. While the Claimant considers these events leading to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko to be central to its claim, the Respondent characterizes them as peripheral and irrelevant to the main issues in the case132 and argues that the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko did not cause any of the losses for which the Claimant claims compensation.133 In this regard, the Respondent points out that the Claimant\u2019s direct shareholdings had been invalidated by Ukrainian court decisions134 before Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated, which was not in any case the proximate cause of the share invalidation;135 that the Claimant did not have any indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta (through AmRuz and Seagroup) at the time that Mi\u2019. Ovcharenko was reinstated, as the Claimant had acquired an interest in them only in December 2007;136 and that the Claimant\u2019s claim for lost payments for oil deliveries were based on the actions of Taiz and Technoprogress in 2009 and unrelated to the events of 19 October 2007.137\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 23:18-21, 26:5-7; Transcript (27 March 2013), 127:23-25 to 128:1-6; Respondent\u2019s Post-Flearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b649-50.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 24:7-9; Transcript (27 March 2013), 128:7-12.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 24:19-25.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 25:1-4; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 52.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 24:10-18; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 51.\n\nTranscript (19.March 2013), 25:9-14; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 53.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent also highlights that Privat Group and the Respondent are distinct entities,138 giving as an example the fact that in the only shareholder meeting that took place after 19 October 2007, Ukraine-controlled Naftogaz voted contrary to the interests of Mr. Ovcharenko and his management team.139 It states, indeed, that \"Naftogaz and Privat Group ' 3 are not blood brothers; they distrust each other intensely.\"140\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 79:18-25 to 80:1.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 78:23-25 to 79:1-6.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 79:10-12.\n\n98.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 disagreement on the events of 19 October 2007 principally concerns the circumstances of Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement on that day and the legality under Ukrainian law of the conduct of the bailiff, Mr. Pryshchepa.\n\ni. The Circumstances of Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s Reinstatement\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the events of 19 October 2007 confirm that Ukrtatnafta was the target of a corporate raid. The Claimant describes the events of this day as a forcible takeover of Ukrtatnafta, carried out by the private security forces of Privat Group with the assistance of Ukrainian government officials, including Mr. Pryshchepa.141\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6143; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, 5114.\n\n100.\n\nRelying on video recordings of security cameras (excerpts of which are submitted as evidence in this arbitration), the Claimant presents the following account of what had occurred:\n\nAs seen in tire security camera footage, at 9:26am on October 19 approximately 25 men dressed in plain clothes stormed the third floor of the Ukrtatnafta administrative building, carrying tools to break through the door to the management offices if necessary. After those 25 men entered the hallway on the third floor, at 9:28am 20 different men wearing unifoms hurried up the stairs to the third floor of the administrative building, paving the way for 21 more men who followed a minute later, including Mr. Ovcharenko and the bailiffs. In total, between 9:26 and 9:30am, *66* men, some carrying weapons, were involved in the takeover of the administrative building at Ukrtatnafta.142\n\nSecond Memorial, 51 34 (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted). *See also* Transcript (18 March 2013), 24:25 to 27:1-17; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, **\u00b6\u00b6 16-17.**\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that locks were broken to enter the premises of the refinery.143\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 24:19-21.\n\n102.\n\nTo support its characterization of the events as a forcible seizure of Ukrtatnafta, the Claimant cites various statements by Ukrainian politicians and refers to scholarly writings, press reports, and reports of NGOs decrying this event.144\n\nMemorial, 5)51 116-121; Transcript (18 March 2013), 33:1-25 to 36:1-7.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimant concludes more generally that the Ukrainian State did not merely turn a blind eye to the events of 19 October 2007 but actively supported them by its courts\u2019 decisions and enforcement orders, by sending bailiffs as well as Ministry of Interior troops, and by conducting \"bogus legal proceedings\".145\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 32:9-11.38:5-21; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 20.\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n104.\n\nReferring to the video recordings produced by the Claimant, the Respondent denies that there was any violence or physical confrontation on the Ukrtatnafta premises on 19 October 2007.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Mr. Pryshchepa had no connection with the groups of men in plain clothes or camouflage seen on the video recording and in fact assumed that they were Ukrtatnafta security guards.146 Mr. Pryshchepa\u2014so the Respondent alleges\u2014accompanied Mr. Ovcharenko onto the Ukrtatnafta premises for the sole purpose of fulfilling his obligation under Article 30(1) of the Law on Enforcement Procedure of Ukraine to verily that Ukrtatnafta had received a copy of the resolution initiating enforcement proceedings and that it had not voluntarily implemented the judgment that was to be executed.147 The Respondent also points out that there was a second bailiff, Mr. Sergey Kruhovyi, who had gone to Ukrtatnafta on 19 October 2007 in order to enforce the decision of 9 November 2004. \"148\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 307,320-321.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 306.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 31:10-18.\n\n106.\n\nAs a result of Mr. Pryshchepa\u2019s visit, Mr. Ovcharenko was provided with the Ukrtatnafta documents, seals and stamps, and confirmed to Mr. Pryshchepa that Ukrtatnafta\u2019s personnel had not prevented him from performing his duties as Chairman of the Management Board. The Respondent thus takes the position that Ukrtatnafta had \"voluntarily reinstated Mr. Ovcharenko.\"149\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 291.\n\n107.\n\nAs to the statements by the Ukrainian politicians strongly criticizing the events of 19 October 2007, as adduced by the Claimant, the Respondent observes that these statements were made during a period in which the details of this day were yet unclear.150\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n\nii. The Legality under Ukrainian Law of the Conduct of the Bailiff\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the manner in which Mr. Pryshchepa enforced the 26 September 2007 Decisions was contrary to Ukrainian law. First, Article 27 of the Ukrainian Enforcement Law required Mr. Pryshchepa to obtain the signature of the officials of Ukrtatnafta as proof that the enforcement resolutions had been properly delivered, which he failed to do.151 Instead, he sent the enforcement resolutions on Friday, 12 October 2007, by ordinary mail, which means that under normal circumstances they would be received after three to four days. According to the Claimant, there is no evidence in the records that the resolution was received any time prior to or after 18 October 2007, the due date for voluntary compliance.152\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b640; Transcript (27 March 2013), 19:10-14.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 53:1-9.\n\n109.\n\nSecond, Article 10.2 of the Enforcement Law states that the sanction for a first instance of non-compliance with enforcement resolutions is a fine, which would be followed by a new time period for compliance; a second instance of non-compliance triggers a further fine and the option of initiating criminal proceedings. The law does not, however, authorize the bailiff to \"forcibly enforce\" the resolutions.153 Thus, on 18 October 2007, Mr. Pryshchepa would have been obliged to establish a new time period for voluntary compliance.154\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b641.\n\nTranscript (IS March 2013), 53:10-14.\n\n110.\n\nThe strictures of Article 10.2 of the Enforcement Law apply especially in the case of the resolution related to the 26 September 2007 Interim Measures. That resolution was only issued on 18 October 2007, which made it unreasonable to fault Ukrtatnafta for its failure to comply voluntarily within one day.155 That said, the Claimant adds that this resolution was in fact never received by Ukrtatnafta but simply read out to its representatives on 19 October 2007 while the takeover was ongoing.156\n\nSecond Memorial, 5141; Transcript (27 March 2013), 19:15-20.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 53:25 to 54:1-3.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the manner in which Mr. Pryshchepa enforced the 26 September 2007 Decisions was in accordance with Ukrainian law. Article 27(1) of the Ukrainian Enforcement Law specifies that resolutions initiating the enforcement of court decisions are to be sent by ordinary mail, with no further requirement that the signature of the company\u2019s officials be obtained.157 Article 30(1) of the Law on Enforcement Procedure requires a bailiff to verify that the resolution initiating enforcement proceedings has been received and that the judgment has not been voluntarily implemented, which is why Mr. Pryshchepa visited the Ukrtatnafta facilities on 19 October 2007.158\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6303.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 306,308-309.\n\n112.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s contention that the 18 October 2007 resolution should not have been enforced on the following day, the Respondent points out that Mr. Pryshchepa had determined that that resolution\u2014which prohibited Ukrtatnafta and its employees from interfering with Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s entry on the premises or his carrying out his duties as Chairman of the Management Board\u2014had not yet been received by Ukrtatnafta. Mr. Pryshchepa accordingly proceeded to read the resolution to the members of the Management Board.159 When he ascertained that Mr. Ovcharenko was provided with the company\u2019s constitutive documents, seal, and stamps, Mr. Pryshchepa recorded the voluntary compliance of Ukrtatnafta with the 26 September 2007 Decisions.160 The Respondent therefore states that \"Tatneft has not shown that Mr. Pryshchepa \u2018forcibly\u2019 enforced anything.\"161\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6310.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 312; Transcript (19 March 2013), 44:17-19.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6306.\n\n**4. Criminal Investigation of 19 October 2007**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Undisputed Facts**\n------------------------\n\n113.\n\nOn 19 October 2007, the Deputy Head of the Investigation Division\u2014Head of the Investigation Unit of the Kremenchug City Department of the Ministry of the Interior, Mr. Oleg Savchenko, initiated an investigation on whether the events at the Kremenchug refinery of the same day violated Article 293 of the Criminal Code, which sanctions group disruptions of the public order (\"Article 293 Investigation\").\n\n114.\n\nOn 24 October 2007, Mr. Savchenko initiated an investigation of the events of 19 October 2007, pursuant to Article 357 of the Criminal Code, in relation to an alleged misappropriation of the seal and stamp of Ukrtatnafta (\"Article 357 Investigation\").\n\n115.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, the Avtozavodsky Regional Court quashed the Article 357 Investigation.\"162\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 55; Transcript (18 March 2013), 82:16-18,\n\n116.\n\nOn 22 May 2008, the Article 293 Investigation was closed under paragraph 2, Article 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code \"due to lack of *corpus delicti.\"163*\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 129.\n\n**(b) Disputed Facts**\n----------------------\n\ni.

The Management at Ukrtatnafta after 2007**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Undisputed Facts**\n------------------------\n\n126.\n\nImmediately after Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated as Chairman of the Management Board on 19 October 2007, he issued an order physically banning Mr. Glushko from the Kremenchug refinery. In the following weeks, the management of the company was restructured under the leadership of Mr. Ovcharenko through various orders that he issued, and he retained numerous consultants and advisors to assist him in managing the company.188\n\nMemorial, \u00b6131; Transcript (18 March 2013), 96:2-9.\n\n127.\n\nFollowing 19 October 2007, all four members of the Management Board who had been nominated by the Tatarstan shareholders were either dismissed or forced to resign.189 The Claimant declined to appoint their replacements.190 It appears (according to the Claimant\u2019s submissions, which on this point were not contested by the Respondent) that key management roles, including those in the financial department, were reassigned either to Mr. Ovcharenko himself or to managers close to him.191\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 130.\n\nCounter-Memorial, 51106.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 131.\n\n128.\n\nIn February 2010, the first and only General Shareholders Meeting since the events of October 2007 was held.

The Claimant\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimant accuses Mr. Ovcharenko of several misdeeds since his reinstatement in 2007. Specifically, the Claimant alleges that the 19 October 2007 order banning Mr. Glushko from the refinery deprived Mr. Glushko of the rights and benefits to which he was entitled as a full member (if not Chairman) of the Management Board.196 Moreover, ignoring the necessary Supervisory Board approval, Mr. Ovcharenko allegedly expanded his own power and assigned positions to his allies while marginalizing the other Management Board members and the employees loyal to Tatarstan.197 Finally, the Claimant alleges that Mr. Ovcharenko vested substantial executive powers in the newly hired consultants and advisors, which in turn caused the dismissal or forced resignation of the Management Board members nominated by the Tatarstan shareholders.198\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 128.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 129,131; Transcript (18 March 2013), 97:1-7.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 130.\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the reallocation of management positions was either a normal reorganization following a change in management, or caused by the alleged lack of cooperation of the board members, and points out that this occurred within days of Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement.199\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b660-61; Transcript (27 March 2013), 47:13-18.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that Mr. Ovcharenko mismanaged Ukrtatnafta\u2019s assets to the point of putting the company on the \"brink of financial and operational collapse,\"200 and states that the financial results show that Ukrtatnafta was profitable before 2007 but not after Mr. Ovcharenko had taken over.201\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 132.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b662.\n\n133.\n\nLastly, the Claimant alleges that, under Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s leadership, Ukrtatnafta ceased to provide it with detailed financial reports on a monthly basis, as it had done since January 2003.202 The Trade Representation of the Republic of Tatarstan in Ukraine wrote letters to the Ukrainian government authorities on behalf of the Claimant and the Republic of Tatarstan to protest this situation, but to no avail.203\u2019\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6133-134.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 63.\n\nii. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s depiction of post-2007 Ukrtatnafta. It criticizes the Claimant for its primary reliance on\u2014and alleged misrepresentation of\u2014the witness statement of Mr. Vladimir Fedotov, the Claimant\u2019s nominee to the Management Board. Moreover, the Respondent observes that the Claimant did not complain to the relevant Ukrainian authorities at any point, despite its claims of illegal behavior.204\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b61101.108.\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent states that the initial lack of cooperation of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s directors following the events of 19 October 2007 forced Mr. Ovcharenko to take on their management duties. He subsequently, however, enjoyed good working relationships with the other members of the Management Board, save for Mr. Fedotov, who kept to himself.205 While the members of the Management Board eventually all resigned, the Respondent points out that the Claimant could have appointed replacement members, but failed to do so.206\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6106.\n\n*Id.*\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimant\u2019s allegation of Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s mismanagement of assets as unsubstantiated.207 Rather, the Respondent points out that it was the Claimant that cut off its oil supply to the Kremenchug refinery to retaliate for Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement, and it was this that jeopardized the financial situation of Ukrtatnafta.208 The Respondent adds that Mr. Ovcharenko had found Ukrtatnafta in a financially desolate state at his reinstatement,209 specifically pointing to payables in excess of UAH 2.6 billion owed to Taiz and Technoprogress, the Claimant\u2019s intermediary suppliers.210\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6103.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6105.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 102.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 103.\n\n137.\n\nLastly, the Respondent does not deny that Mr. Ovcharenko appointed consultants and advisors, but points out that the Claimant has alleged no wrongdoing on their part.211\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 107.\n\n**7. The Tribunal\u2019s Considerations Concerning the Facts of Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s Reinstatement and Related Events**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to the discussion of the facts as alleged by the Parties with a view to establish which in its assessment has been the backdrop of the dispute submitted to its resolution.\n\n139.\n\nLike many projects of the kind characterizing the creation of Ukrtatnafta it is not difficult to ascertain that it started out in the best spirit of cooperation, as reflected in the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and the Incorporation Agreement, as well as in the respective decrees issued by the Tatarstan and Ukraine governments. The purpose of ensuring parity was quite evident in the arrangements concerning the distribution of shares and the contributions to be made by each party, in essence consisting of oil wells and production facilities in Tatarstan and the Kremenchug refinery in the Ukraine. This multinational arrangement was undoubtedly the best available option at the time following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the separation of its constitutive territorial and political entities.\n\n140.\n\nIn the short run, however, it appears that such purposes would not be easily attained. While it is quite probable that there were objective technical, economic and legal difficulties to contributing the Tatarstan oil wells as originally envisaged, it is also relevant to note that the alternative contributions that were finally authorized by the shareholders were in amounts that, given the magnitude of the business projected, were not very impressive. US$ 31 million for Tatneft, US$ 30 million for AmRuz and US$ 35 million for Seagroup are the figures in the record. Moreover, the arrangements leading to these contributions, notably the payment of US$ 1 million by Tatneft and the intra-group transfer of shares held by Zenit Bank valued at US$ 30 million, like the issuance of promissory notes by AmRuz and Seagroup and the extension of payment dates, are expressive of this difficulty. Questions also arose as to the valuation of the Kremenchug refinery.\n\n141.\n\nIt can also be noted that during the start-up period intra-corporate relations appeared to be harmonious but this began gradually to change. The Tatar shareholders were more experienced in the oil business, as evidenced by the strong participation of Tatneft in the project, and as a result acquired greater influence in the management of Ukrtatnafta. Although Tatneft was nominally a minority shareholder, the incorporation of AmRuz and Seagroup and the strategic and voting alliance that ensued among the three shareholders led to greater influence in the decisions of the company. Also the Tatar Ministerial participation in the shareholding was quite naturally associated to Tatneft and its related companies.\n\n142.\n\nThis situation could not be to the liking of the Ukrainian side, as a consequence of which a power struggle ensued within Ukrtatnafta that led to the appointment, dismissal, reappointment and reiterated dismissal of the Chairman of the Management Board, Mr. Pavel V. Ovcharenko, as well as to long-lasting lawsuits and court decisions examined above. This power struggle was at the heart of the events of 19 October 2007, which as noted the Claimant characterizes as a \"raider\" action and the Respondent as the peaceful reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko in compliance with court decisions. Scant reference to a letter of resignation of Mr. Ovcharenko in one testimony does not find support in the documents in the record of this case.212\n\nWitness Testimony of Fedotov, Transcript (20 March 2013), 39:13-19.\n\n143.\n\nOne other fact needs to be taken into account for the proper understanding of the dispute before the Tribunal. Beginning in 2007 a group of companies associated with the Privat Bank, which in turn were all directly or indirectly related to Mr. Igor Kolomoisky, an influential businessman with extensive interests in the oil industry and other business activities in Ukraine, developed an interest in gaining control over Ukrtatnafta, which had a central role in that sector. One company in that group by the name of Korsan acquired in 2007 a modest 1.15% of the shareholding. Following complex corporate arrangements and litigation, by 2010 Korsan had become the owner of 47.0S% of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shareholding, which together with other related interests attained up to 56% of the shareholding, with the State Property Fund of Ukraine holding 43.05%.213 The Tatarstan, Tatneft, AmRuz and Seagroup participation was gradually diminished until it became totally extinguished. These arrangements notwithstanding, the Respondent rightly points out that at no point has the Ukrainian State ceased to be a minority shareholder in Ukrtatnafta.214 Mr. Kolomoisky, as will be discussed further below, was called as a witness by the Tribunal at the oral hearing.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6218, referring to Annual Report for the financial year 2010, dated April 28.2011 (C-475).\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 155:17-25 to 156:1-14.\n\n144.\n\nAt this point the original influence exercised in the company by the Tatarstan and related shareholders, including Tatneft, was reversed and it was the Ukrainian shareholding that acquired prominence in the control and management of Ukrtatnafta. Both Parties believe that Ukrtatnafta was badly mismanaged while under the control of the other party, an issue that was also at the heart of the confrontations between shareholders.215 These developments were quite naturally resisted by Tatneft.216 In fact, it is of interest to note, as the Respondent does, that it was Tatneft that first complained to Ukraine about AmRuz and Seagroup\u2019s acquisition of shares in Ukrtatnafta because of having only nominally paid for them with unsecured notes and because of the effect this together with other factors had on the alteration of the parity principle, a view that later changed in light of its strategic alliance between Tatarstan entities and Amruz and Seagroup.217 The view has been expressed, however, that AmRuz and Seagroup were at least originally controlled by the Ukrainian side.218 What was at stake in these discussions was not the form of the capital contributions by different shareholders but how this would determine which side, Ukraine or Tatarstan, would control the company, which also explains why later Tatneft would support AmRuz and Seagroup so as to avoid a change of control.219\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Fedotov, \u00b6\u00b6 10-15; Witness Statement of Syubaev,\u00b6\u00b6 1-13; First Witness Statement of Liapka, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17; Second Witness Statement of Liapka, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5; Witness Testimony of Fedotov, Transcript (19 March 2013), 156:5-25 to 157:1-18.\n\nWitness Testimony of Syubaev, Transcript (19 March 2013), 123:9-25 to 124:1-19,128:5-20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 8; Transcript (19 March 2013), 128:5-25 to 130:1-21.\n\nWitness Testimony of Syubaev, Transcript (19 March 2013), 142:16-25 to 143:1-25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 8, with reference to the Witness Testimony of Syubaev.\n\n145.\n\nAs will be discussed further below, at this point as a consequence of the modification of the capital contribution the parity principle was reversed in favor of the Ukrainian shareholding, and such principle had thereby become defunct.\n\n146.\n\nIt is against this complex background that the Tribunal must now turn to establish whether there was in fact a corporate raid and the inextricably related question of the dismissal and reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined the evidence submitted and can conclude that the events of ' 19 October 2007 at the Kremenchug refinery were not that peaceful.220 Both witness statements and the video recording of the events show that in fact there was a forceful takeover of the Kremenchug refinery and the administrative offices. The not insignificant number of people appearing in those recordings forcing their way into the premises, some in uniform, is credible evidence that a physical occupation took place on that date. While it is not clearly established that weapons were available to such occupants neither can this feature be ruled out, and this was certainly the case when Ministry of the Interior troops were called to secure the refinery a few days later on 24 October 2007.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Fedotov, \u00b6\u00b635-52, Second Witness Statement of Fedotov, \u00b6\u00b62-6.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted the various statements submitted by the Claimant as to the existence of corporate raids and similar takeovers in Ukraine, including the statements of political and business leaders and international agencies.221 While this is undoubtedly a recurrent phenomenon it cannot be relied upon as evidence that every single corporate acquisition is the result of some form of wrongdoing either by private individuals and entities or entailing the connivance of State agencies and the judiciary. This can only be established on a case by case basis and the Tribunal will do so next in the context of the discussion about the dismissal and reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the courts\u2019 decisions related thereto.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 33:2-25 to 36:1-7.\n\n149.\n\nThe controversy relating to the dismissal and reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Management Board needs to be discussed in the context of the basic principles governing corporate management and their reflection in the applicable law. The Tribunal has no doubt that the dismissal of the Chairman of the Management Board is a decision that can be adopted without hindrance by the corporate governing bodies if for some reason they are unhappy about his performance. The fact that tire dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko was decided in the first instance by the Supervisory Board on 21 September 2004 and ultimately endorsed by the General Shareholders Meeting on 12 November 2004 responds to this principle as it is expressly recognized in Articles 99 and 159 of the Civil Code.\n\n150.\n\nThe choice of who is considered the most qualified Chairman of a company or its Chief Executive Officer is recognized by Article 99(3) of the Ukrainian Civil Code allowing for the suspension of members of the executive body of a company from their duties.222 While the Respondent has argued that such power relates to \"temporary suspension\" and not a permanent dismissal, the Claimant\u2019s view that such temporary suspension is addressed by Article 46 of the Labor Code is convincing.223 In fact, this last Article addresses events such as coming to work intoxicated with alcohol and other such misconduct of an employee which is very different from a corporate decision concerning the performance of duties of its executive officers. But even if the general provisions on the termination of labor agreements embodied in Articles 40 and 41 of the Labor Code are taken into account, there is evidently a difference between the ambit of application of the civil code and that of labor legislation. Moreover, the dismissal of the Chairman of the Management Board by resolution of the Supervisory Board was explicitly included in Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s employment contract in accordance with Article 36 of the Labor Code.224\n\nFirst Expert Report of Toms, \u00b6149.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Tonis, at \u00b6\u00b644-48.\n\nMr. Ovcharenko\u2019s Employment Contract dated 6 February 2003 (REX-17).\n\n151.\n\nWhether it might have been preferable for the decision to terminate Mr. Ovcharenko to have stated specific reasons is one thing, but the fact that even without this explanation dismissal is the exercise of a valid right is quite another. On the other hand, while the Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that Articles 99 and 159 of the Civil Code do not provide that compliance with the Labor Code is not required,225 it is also true that neither does the Civil Code provide that the subject matter of the Labor Code ought to prevail over essential provisions of contract law. The fact that Article 36(8) of the Labor Code is referred to by the Order to dismiss Mr. Ovcharenko does not alter the effects of the Civil Code.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Slides, 77.\n\n152.\n\nIt has been noted that the Avtozavodsky District Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko on 9 November 2004. It was held by the Court that the power to order such dismissal was not within the competence of the Supervisory Board but of the General Shareholders Meeting and that further the Supervisory Board had been enjoined from making decisions concerning the appointment and termination of members of the Management Board, including its Chairman. Assuming that this was a defect of such dismissal, the fact that it responded to the company\u2019s policy is not to be doubted as in fact was confirmed not long thereafter by the very General Shareholders Meeting held on 12 November 2004 where Mr. Ovcharenko was again dismissed following his reinstatement a day earlier.\n\n153.\n\nAs the Court chose to base its decision on the Ukrainian Labor Code and not the Civil Code, it could not of course address the question of the powers of corporate governance found at the origin of the dismissal but only the grounds governing employment under the Labor Code, which as noted is a different matter. Even though the reasoning of the Court was not to the liking of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Management, the Management reinstated Mr. Ovcharenko as an employee on 11 November 2004 following the order of the Court to this effect. As also noted, the General Shareholders Meeting held on 12 November 2004 once again removed Mr. Ovcharenko and elected Mr. Glushko as the new Chairman. The Tribunal cannot fail to notice that there was in this sequence of events a kind of cat and mouse strategy, but in the end the Court\u2019s decision was formally complied with, although whether Mr. Glushko, the Acting Chairman, duly discussed the implications of the litigation with the Management Board is subject to important doubt.226 The Respondent believes that the reinstatement was a \"sham\" and that it failed to comply with various procedural requirements of Ukrainian law.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 43:25 to 44:1-9; Witness Testimony of Fedotov in Transcript (20 March 20B).39:8.40:6-19, and41:2-5; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, 55.\n\n154.\n\nThis corporate governance lasted in any event for the three years that followed until new court decisions intervened in the ongoing dispute between the main protagonists of the corporate struggle. Other interests also had a role to play in this process, this being in particular the case of Naftogaz, a Ukrainian State-owned company that in fact has resisted the efforts of the Privat Group to acquire control of Ukrtatnafta, as evidenced by the fact that Naftogaz voted against the appointment of Mr. Ovcharenko at the General Shareholders Meeting of 5 February 2010.227\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 55. at 28-29; Exhibit C-381; Transcript (27 March 2013), 78:6-25 to 79:1-17.\n\n155.\n\nThe next issue for the Tribunal to address is the question of the *ex parte* Supplementary Judgment and the *ex parte* interim measures issued by the Kriukivskiy District Court on 26 September 2007, both issued in the context of the Court\u2019s understanding that the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, ordered on 9 November 2004, had not been implemented and that a Supplementary Judgment was required so as to indicate the specific measures to be taken to that effect. Both decisions were appealed by Ukrtatnafta and further proceedings were initiated by Mr. Glushko seeking protection of his rights as Chairman of the Management Board, but none of them succeeded.\n\n156.\n\nSuch decisions were followed by four writs of execution issued by Bailiff Yevgeniy Pryshchepa initiating enforcement proceedings sent by ordinary mail giving a short delay for voluntary compliance and in one case for immediate enforcement. Whether the signature of an authorized representative of Ukrtatnafta was required or not as a matter for service of process to be legally valid, a point on which the Parties disagree, does not detract from the fact that Ukrtatnafta was not on notice of the *ex parte* proceedings taking place at this stage and that in any event the period granted does not appear to have been adequate for an orderly process of voluntary enforcement. The Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that service by means of an unsigned postal note, as pointed out by the Claimant, is not. conducive to certainty of notification.228\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 11; Second Expert Report of Toms, at 63-64.\n\n157.\n\nThe Supplementary Judgment, in addition to underlining Ukrtatnafta\u2019s obligation to grant Mr. Ovcharenko access to the company\u2019s premises, specifically included within his powers that of making decisions concerning the organizational, operational and economic, financial and other activities of the company. The Parties, as also noted above, have different views about whether this latter aspect of the decision granted Mr. Ovcharenko new remedies not discussed in the proceedings leading to the 9 November 2004 decision on his reinstatement and whether on the whole they might have entailed measures out of proportion in respect of the reinstatement issue and the possible remedies to such situation. In any event, the fact is that Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement was inextricably associated with the aim of achieving a complete takeover of the company\u2019s management, which in fact he proceeded to effect swiftly.229\n\nWitness Testimony of Liapka, Transcript (25 March 2013), 22:3-25 to 23:1-10.\n\n158.\n\nThe discussion about the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Judgment and the decision on interim measures is essentially based on the issue of whether there was or not a valid enforcement of the 9 November 2004 decision ordering Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement. While as noted the Claimant believes that this was positively the case, in the Respondent\u2019s view, and as contained in the 26 September 2007 Decisions, there had been no such valid enforcement. The question was discussed at length during the litigation that followed Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s alleged reinstatement on 11 November 2004 that culminated on 29 August 2007 when the order became binding.\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s view that if there had been difficulties with or even the impossibility of carrying out such enforcement the proper procedure e would have been to apply to the District Court and not to request separate interim measures of an *ex parte* nature in violation of Article 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is convincing. This is so, first, because as a matter of fact the reinstatement order had been enforced on 11 November 2004, even if on a purely formal basis as shown by the second dismissal of Mr. Ovcharenko the following day, and this again was a clear expression of the policy and decision irrespectively of whether the resolutions were issued by the Supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Management Board or the General Shareholders Meeting, a point also subject to much discussion between the Parties.\n\n160.\n\nNext, and more importantly, the Claimant\u2019s view is convincing because under such procedure the Parties would have had the possibility of fully arguing their case even though this was done in prior litigation.230 In any event it is to be noted that in the Respondent\u2019s view the 26 September 2007 Supplementary Judgment would have had the same legal consequences as the Interim Measures, but still this does not detract from the fact that *ex parte* decisions can only be justified on very exceptional bases and strictly following the requirements laid down under Article 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which does not appear to have been the case here. The chronology of these decisions, showing that the interim measures were issued thirty minutes earlier than the Supplementary Judgment they were supposed to enforce, does not help to explain a logical legal sequence of these acts, which is normally the other way around.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, 10.\n\n161.\n\nIt was the purported enforcement of the Supplementary Judgment and the interim measures of 26 September 2007 which led to the events described in connection with the occupation of the Kremenchug refinery. It is at this point that the role of the bailiff Mr. Yevgeniy Pryshchepa in these events becomes particularly relevant. If has been considered above that the various writs of execution issued in respect of that enforcement were not quite transparent and timely and did not follow the strict requirements of Articles 24 and 87 of the Ukrainian Law on Enforcement Proceedings.231 The Claimant has also noted that even a supplementary judgment is subject to strict requirements under Articles 11 and 220 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which again do not appear to have been duly observed in this case.\n\nExpert Report of Martinenko, 105-117.\n\n162.\n\nIt has also been considered that the occupation of the premises does not appear to have been as peaceful as described by the Respondent and the bailiff.232 While it is true that physical violence appears to have been used on the occasion of the events of 19 October 2007 in a limited way, concerning in particular security guards and breaking into the premises,233 the role of the bailiff was not as simple as providing for and verifying the enforcement in question.234\u2019\u2019 What has been described as the voluntary reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko by the Ukrtatnafta officials present during those events is not credible as it followed various measures of coercion, in particular preventing such officials from leaving the premises. The fact that a few days later the Minister of the Interior\u2019s troops were called in does not corroborate that characterization of a voluntary reinstatement either, particularly in view of the fact that the units called were from a rather distant region.235\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Pryshchepa,\u00b6\u00b614-20; Second Witness Statement of Pryshchepa, \u00b6\u00b62-7.\n\nWitness Testimony of Savchenko, Transcript (20 March 2013), 74:2-17.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission. \u00b6\u00b616-17.\n\nWitness Testimony of Savchenko, Transcript (20 March 2013), 102:20-25 to 103:1-7, 103:8-14; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 20.\n\n163.\n\nThe reinstatement of Mr, Ovcharenko was swiftly completed that very day and the lawsuits and appeals commenced by the departing Chairman Mr. Glushko were successively dismissed by the Avtozadovsky District Court of Kremenchug and the Poltava Region Court of Appeals. An unsuccessful takeover on the part of Mr. Glushko on 23 October 2007 has also been alleged by a witness for tire Respondent.236 As will be examined further below Ukrtatnafta\u2019s management was completely reorganized following Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement. It must also be noted that both the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the reorganization of the company were closely linked to the interests of Korsan as explained in Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s statement at the hearing.237\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Liapka, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\nTranscript (25 March 2013), 162:10-13; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\n164.\n\nAn issue related to these events is that concerning the criminal investigations that were initiated because of the complaints lodged about the alleged illegality of the enforcement proceedings, disruption of public order and misappropriation of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s seal and stamp. The investigations discussed earlier were either quashed by the Avtozavodsky Regional Court or closed by administrative decision.\n\n165.\n\nTwo key witnesses appeared in connection with these investigations, Mr. Oleg Savchenko, the investigation officer, on behalf of the Claimant, and Mr. Yuri Bergelson, a lawyer for Mr. Ovcharenko, who appeared as a witness called by the Tribunal. While the first was of the view that the investigations were impeded by the officers in charge of the intervening agencies so as to prevent the findings and completion, including allegations of the Prosecutor having been paid US$ 25 million,238 the second witness vehemently denies any such allegations239 and affirmed that Mr. Savchenko had misapplied the provisions of Articles 293 and 357 of the Criminal Code governing such investigations, which was the true reason for their termination,\n\nWitness Statement of Savchenko, \u00b6 23; Witness Testimony of Savchenko, Transcript (20 March 2013), 90:25 to 92:1-16.\n\nWitness Testimony of Bergelson, Transcript (21 March 2013), 4:11-18.6:1-25 to 7:1-6.\n\n166.\n\nBesides the fact that the two witnesses do not appear to love each other, the Tribunal finds that their respective credibility is quite limited, Mr. Savchenko\u2019s account of a meeting purportedly held with Mr. Bergelson is rather vague, and the allegations of the latter attempting to influence him and referring to bribes cannot be adequately established on this basis. Mr. Bergelson\u2019s testimony is even less credible as he repeatedly offered contradictory versions of his role in these investigations and proceedings and how he became involved in them.240\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 21 n. 57.\n\n167.\n\nBe that as it may, the Tribunal cannot fail to notice that the investigations were not carried out in spite of the fact that the complaints about the occupation and taking over of the Kremenchug refinery offered enough elements that would justify the thoroughness of these proceedings,\n\n168.\n\nThe facts discussed above show that immediately following his reinstatement Mr. Ovcharenko proceeded to the complete reorganization of Ukrtatnafta, both at the managerial level and as regards the composition of the governing organs of the company. While this fact has not been disputed, the reasons motivating such measures have been a matter of total disagreement between the Parties,\n\n169.\n\nWhether or not the company had been in a state of mismanagement under the former Chairman, Mr. Glushko, and whether there were serious financial consequences arising from such situation, or whether the reality was exactly the opposite,241 the measures taken in order to ban Mr. Glushko from the refinery do not help the Respondent\u2019s argument that all decisions taken by the incoming Chairman were purely a matter of managerial reorganization. Besides his role as former Chairman of the Management Board, Mr. Glushko had nonetheless remained a member of such organ and was thus, as argued by the Claimant, deprived of his corporate rights and relieved of his duties.\n\nWitness Testimony of Fedotov, Transcript (20 March 2013), 1:10-25 to 7:1-25.\n\n170.\n\nMoreover, it appears well established that the incoming Chairman considerably expanded Ins powers and proceeded to appoint a number of consultants and advisors responding to his authority,242 a plan that appears to have been prepared in advance of the 19 October 2007 events.243 The aggregate of such decisions led to the dismissal or resignation of the members of the Management Board nominated by the Tatarstan shareholders and a number of staff members related to the Tatarstan interests in the company.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Fedotov, \u00b6\u00b6 53-63; Witness Testimony of Fedotov, Transcript (20 March 2013), 36:4-25 to 37:1-5.\n\nWitness Testimony of Liapka, Transcript (25 March 2013), 6:2-5, 7:14-21.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that there was a lack of cooperation of such board members is credible as the confrontation and. corporate struggle between shareholders and management continued unabated during all this period, but remedying such situation should not have been achieved by measures of the kind discussed but by means of the mechanisms of corporate governance, including the Supervisory Board and ultimately the General Shareholders Meeting. Equally serious is the fact that the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the new management ceased to provide it with the monthly financial reports appears not to have been contradicted, a decision which quite clearly interferes with essential corporate rights of shareholders. Whether the Claimant complained of this irregularity to the authorities or whether the Tatarstan Trade Representative in Ukraine protested does not detract from the fact that such irregularity existed.\n\n**B.

Case 32/1\n------------\n\n172.\n\nThe events discussed were followed late in 2007 by proceedings before the Ukrainian courts concerning the Claimant\u2019s legal position as a shareholder in Ukrtatnafta\u2014and in particular the propriety of the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of its Ukrtatnafta shares\n\n173.\n\nIn Fact, on 19 December 2007, the Prosecutor commenced proceedings on behalf of the Government and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of Ukraine before the Kyiv Economic Court under Case 32/1 for, among other things, the invalidation of the shareholder resolutions that had approved the modification of the capital contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders and the liquidation of Ukrtatnafta.244 Korsan filed a statement of claim in support of the Prosecutor\u2019s claim on 13 March 2008.245 In bringing this claim, the Prosecutor contended that he did not learn of the violations that were the subject of Case 32/1 until he received an 28 April 2007 letter from the then Minister of Fuel and Energy, Mr. Boyko, who complained, following an Investigation of Ukrtatnafta carried out by the Ukrainian Audit Control Board,246 that the formation of the authorized share capital of Ukrtatnafta violated Ukrainian law.247\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 113; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b617.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6121.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 165.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 58.\n\n174.\n\nOn 4 September 2008, the Kyiv Economic Court accepted the Prosecutor\u2019s arguments on the applicable three-year statute of limitations and found that the claim was not barred by it;248 declared that the change in the form of the capital contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders and the modification of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s constituent documents with regard to it was illegal, and thereby set aside the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meeting resolutions with respect to those issues;249 and ordered that Ukrtatnafta be cancelled from the trade register and liquidated.250 The reasoning behind the Court\u2019s decision to set aside the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meeting resolutions authorizing the change in form of the capital contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders is similar to that employed by the Economic Court of the Poltava Region in Case 17/178 on 3 November 2009, which will be discussed in detail below.251\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 168-172.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 176.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 176; Joint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 135.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter- Memorial, \u00b6 192.\n\n175.\n\nSeveral parties appealed this decision to the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal, namely the Prosecutor, on 10 September 2008;252 Naftogaz, on 11 September 2008;253 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, on 12 September 2008;254 and the Claimant, also on 12 September 2008.255\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 137.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 138.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 139.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 140.\n\n176.\n\nOn 14 May 2009, the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal confirmed the renewal of the limitation period; upheld the nullification of the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meeting resolutions and all versions of the Incorporation Agreement that approved the modification in the form of the contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders; and reversed the order that Ukrtatnafta be cancelled from the trade register and liquidated.256 The Higher Economic Court confirmed this judgment on 20 August 20 09.257 On 27 October 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the 20 August 2009 judgment of the Higher Economic Court,258 and rejected the cassation appeal' filed by the Claimant on June 2009.259\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 158; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 181-182; Transcript (18 March 2013), 199:15-25.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 169.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6|179.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, 160.\n\n177.\n\nOn 18 April 2011, the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal dismissed the application for review of the case.260\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 198.\n\nii. Case 17/178\n---------------\n\n178.\n\nBefore Case 17/178 is discussed in detail, it should be noted that Ukrtatnafta filed a similar claim\u2014in what was to be Case 17/1\u2014against the Republic of Tatarstan, Infosistema (the new share register of Ukrtatnafta that was controlled by the Privat Group), and ING Bank Ukraine (the nominal holder of the Republic of Tatarstan\u2019s shares in Ukrtatnafta) on 18 December 2008 to invalidate the shareholdings of the Republic of Tatarstan based on the alleged illegality of the modification of its capital contribution to Ukrtatnafta from \"[a] parcel of shares in economic entities of oil refining complex [...] the right to develop oil deposits, and other state-owned assets of enterprises and organizations of the Republic of Tatarstan\"261 to shares in OAO Tatnefteprom, one of the founding Ukrtatnafta shareholders from Tatarstan.262\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 17, *citing to* the Decree of the President of Tatarstan No. UP-883 \"On the Establishment of Transnational Financial and Industrial Oil Company Ukrtatnafta\", 13 December 1994 (REX-6 1; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 30.\n\nCounter-Memorial, 46; Memorial, \u00b6 20.\n\n179.\n\nThe procedural history of Case 17/1 is as follows. On 13 March 2009, the Economic Court of the Poltava Region \"decide[d] to reinstate the period of limitations for Ukrtatnafta,\" and invalidated the share purchase agreement for the purchase of 28% of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shares by the Republic of Tatarstan.263 The Kyiv Interregional Economic Court of Appeal reversed this decision on 22 July 2009.264 On 25 August 2009, the Higher Economic Court granted Ukrtatnafta\u2019s cassation appeal and reversed the decision of the Kyiv Interregional Economic Court of Appeal.265 On 3 November 2009, the Supreme Court rejected the cassation appeal filed by the Republic of Tatarstan against the judgment of the Higher Economic Court.266 As the Respondent has pointed out, the Claimant does not make any claim in respect of Case 17/1,267 which is why it will not be discussed in further detail here.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 151.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 167.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 171.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 183.\n\nCounter-Memorial,\u00b6 21.\n\n180.\n\nCase 17/178 was commenced on 31 August 2009, when Ukrtatnafta sued the Claimant and other parties before the Economic Court of the Poltava Region to seek invalidation of the Claimant\u2019s purchase of Ukrtatnafta shares, based on the holding in Case 32/1.268 To establish that its claim was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations, Ukrtatnafta argued that it was unable to challenge the validity of the General Shareholders Meetings and share purchase agreements relating to the form of the contributions of the Tatarstan shareholders prior to the decision in Case 32/1,269\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6172; Memorial, \u00b6224; Transcript (27 March 2013), 67:24-25 to 68:1-5.\n\nCounter-Memorial, 202-203; Transcript (27 March 2013), 68:8-21.\n\n181.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, the Deputy President of the Economic Court of the Poltava Region dismissed the challenge that the Claimant had launched against one of the judges hearing the cases,270 in which the Claimant had alleged that the particular judge was manifestly biased against the Claimant as he had decided against the Republic of Tatarstan in Case 17/1,271\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6181.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6226.\n\n182.\n\nOn 3 November 2009, the Economic Court of the Poltava Region accepted Ukrtatnafta\u2019s arguments on the statute of limitations and found that its claim was not barred by it; held that the shareholder resolutions accepting a modification of the Claimant\u2019s contribution from fixed assets to cash were unlawful; and invalidated the Claimant\u2019s share purchase and ordered the return of its shares to Ukrtatnafta.272\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6182, Memorial, \u00b6 230; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 123.\n\n183.\n\nSpecifically, the Court found that the Claimant\u2019s contribution of fixed assets relating to the operation of specified oil wells\u2014like the stated and actual contribution by the SPFU of the Kremenchug refinery\u2014was essential to establishing Ukrtatnafta and to fulfilling the objective for its establishment.273 The resolution during the General Shareholders Meeting dated 10 June 1998 that permitted a modification in the Claimant\u2019s contribution to the authorized capital of Ukrtatnafta therefore violated the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, the Ukrainian Constitution, Decree No. 704/94, and the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 487.274\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6124.\n\n*Id.*\n\n184.\n\nOn the basis that the Claimant did not pay for its shares in the form specified by the above-mentioned authorities, the Court found that the Claimant had breached Article 8(3) of the Law of Ukraine \"On Securities and Exchange,\" which conditions the transfer of shares on the full payment for them.275 It thus set aside Option Agreement No. 77 of 20 May 1998 between Ukrtatnafta and Zenit Bank, the 16 June 2000 Share Purchase Agreement between Ukrtatnafta and Zenit Bank, and the 15 August 2000 share transfer on the basis of which the Claimant had obtained its shares, and ordered the Claimant to return its shares to Ukrtatnafta.276\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 125.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 234; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 126.\n\n185.\n\nThe Kyiv Interregional Economic Court of Appeal affirmed this ruling on 23 December 2009.277 The Higher Economic Court dismissed the Claimant\u2019s cassation appeal of this ruling to the Supreme Court on 10 February 2010.278 And on 26 May 2010, tire Higher Economic Court dismissed the appeal of the Claimant against its 10 February 2010 ruling.279\n\nJoi nt Factual Chronology, \u00b61183.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 191.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 194.\n\n**(b) Disputed Facts**\n----------------------\n\ni.

therefore, his statement that he learned of the relevant amendments to the Ukrtatnafta documents only in July 2007 was clearly and demonstrably false.288 Finally, the 5 August 2010 application of the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine (\"CMU\") to reopen Case 32/1 stated that the Prosecutor \"knew that [he] had valid reasons for filing a claim over violations of procedure of incorporation of [Ukrtatnafta] on 25 November 2003,\"289 which was the date of a letter from the Prosecutor to the Ukrainian Parliament, in which the Prosecutor highlighted a resolution of the General Shareholder Meeting of 19 July 1997.290 Neither the Prosecutor nor the Ministry of Justice disclosed these facts, and the Kyiv Economic Court rejected an application by Seagroup that the Prosecutor be ordered to produce documents relating to the 2002 and 2004 inspections of Ukrtatnafta, which would have cast doubt on the Prosecutor\u2019s claim that he had no knowledge of the relevant facts before 2007.291\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 124;

it points out that Ukrtatnafta had known of its constituent documents, the relevant resolutions of the General Shareholders Meetings, the shareholder transactions it had entered into, and its shareholder contributions for years.292 The Claimant rejects the argument that the Respondent could not have sought the annulment of the share purchase agreements with Zenit Bank and Tatneft until Case 32/1 was decided293 by identifying the legal alternatives open to the Respondent that would have resulted in its desired outcome\u2014the annulment of the share purchases\u2014without the annulment of the General Shareholders Meetings\u2019 resolutions.294\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 228;

The Merits of the Court Decisions\n-------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n194.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimant alleges that the founding shareholders all agreed that it would be impracticable for the Tatarstan parties to contribute oilfields and oil-related assets due to high exploration and extraction costs, the Ukrainian economic crisis that affected the market for refined oil products, and potential problems posed by the legislation then in force; and thereby decided on other forms of contribution from the Tatarstan shareholders.316\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 19.\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimant then states that the court decisions annulling the shares of the Tatarstan parties due to the inadequacy of their asset contributions have little basis in Ukrainian law because neither the Ukrtatnafta Treaty nor any legal provision refers to the Tatarstan shareholders\u2019 contributions or establishes \"principles and rules\" concerning them.317 Moreover, the Ukrtatnafta shareholders were empowered to amend the Incorporation Agreement and Charter without governmental approval.318\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 142-152; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 37.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 151-165; Transcript (18 March 2013), 61:23-25 to 62:1-8.\n\n196.\n\nWith regard to the first point, the Claimant clarifies that Article 2 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty did not define the nature and content of the \"principles and provisions\" to be adopted by the Governments or make these principles an integral part of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty or legislation319 and the Ukrainian Presidential Decree did not create obligations for the Claimant or any of the other Tatarstan shareholders.320 Moreover, Resolution No. 487 of 4 July 1995 of the CMU did not address the form of contributions of the Claimant.321\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6143.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 147, 147 n. 305.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 148; Transcript (18 March 2013), 61:17-23.\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the fifteen-year life span of Ukrtatnafta and its profitability for a time rebut the argument that the change in the contribution from the Claimant and the Republic of Tatarstan made it impossible for Ukrtatnafta to achieve its objective322 or that the Claimant\u2019s contribution of oil equipment was an essential condition for the creation of Ukrtatnafta.323\u2019 It also points out that, if it were true that Ukraine would not have agreed to sign the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and the Incorporation Agreement had it known that the intended contributions of the Tatar parties would not be honored, then the Ukrtatnafta Treaty would have addressed this matter.324\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 150.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 151.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u2018] 152.\n\n198.\n\nIn support of its position that Ukrainian law allowed Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shareholders to amend the company\u2019s Incorporation Agreement and Charter without governmental approval,325 the Claimant refers to Article 12 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, which does not impose the requirement of governmental approval for the amendment of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s constituent instruments326 and the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and Decree No. 704/94, which do not authorize the Ukrainian and Tatarstan Governments to approve Ukrtatnafta\u2019s constituent documents or to veto the General Shareholders Meeting\u2019s decisions amending them. At the same time, Article 8(5) of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty does empower the General Shareholders Meeting to approve the constituent documents.327 The Claimant further points out that neither the Ukrtatnafta Treaty nor Decree No. 704/94 contains \"basic principles\" concerning the required contributions of the shareholders or otherwise defines the content of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s constituent documents.328 |\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6153-155; Transcript (18 March 2013), 71:17-24.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 157-158.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6160.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 161; Transcript (18 March 2013), 61:17-25 to 62:1-3; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 40.\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the Respondent did in fact approve the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meetings\u2019 resolutions through the SPFU \u2019329 and high-ranking Government officials who attended them and/or served on the Supervisory Board at those times.\"330\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 163.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 164.\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimant also characterizes the Courts\u2019 conclusions on Article 8(3) of the Law of Ukraine \"On Securities and Stock Exchange\" as \"grossly inconsistent and completely divorced from the facts that the courts themselves [had] ascertained\" because on the one band, the Courts acknowledged that the Claimant had paid US$ 31 million in cash as its contribution to Ukrtatnafta\u2019s capital, while on the other hand, the plain language of Article 8(3) makes clear that its application could have been triggered only if the Claimant had made no contribution at all.331\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 231-233.\n\n201.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert on Ukrainian law confirms that, under Article 48(2) of the Ukrainian SSR Civil Code, the Ukrainian courts were obliged to grant restitution to Tatneft after invalidating its share acquisitions. According to the expert, courts had to apply the provision *proprio motu,* irrespective of whether any party actually requests restitution, as decided by the court in the *Dekon* case.332 Accordingly, a court that invalidates an agreement, should apply Article 48(2) of the Ukrainian SSR Civil Code and \"return the property to the parties whose contract has been subject to invalidation.\"333 The Claimant highlights that the Economic Court of the Poltava Region in fact did not order Ukrtatnafta to return the cash payment the Claimant made, which amounted to US$ 31 million.334\n\nSecond Expert Report of Toms, at 69; Transcript (25 March 2013), 86:1-5.\n\nTranscript (25 March 2013), 89:10-17.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 235.\n\n202.\n\nLastly, the Claimant questions the entry into force of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty\u2014on which the Ukrainian courts relied heavily\u2014as a matter of public international law as well as Ukrainian law. First, under public international law, an international agreement is an agreement between two States which would not be the case when it comes to the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.335 Second, according to Article 13 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, it would enter into force as of the date of the last notification of compliance by the Parties with their domestic procedures. The Claimant notes that there is no evidence in the records that such notifications had been exchanged.\"336 Third, as a matter of Ukrainian law, it is undisputed that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was never approved by the Ukrainian Council of Ministers under Article 9(b) of the (then applicable) 1993 Law on International Agreements.337\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 7:11-12.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 7:13-19.8:13-17.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 7:20-25 to 8:1.\n\n203.\n\nCountering the Respondent\u2019s position, the Claimant argues that, if the Ukrtatnafta Treaty had come into effect, the Ukrainian courts would not have been competent to address its alleged violations since Article 11 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty provided that all disputes relating to its interpretation and fulfillment should be resolved by way of negotiations and consultations. Consequently, if Ukraine \"really believed [that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty had been violated], it would have been required under Article 11 to address the matter with the Government of Tatarstan; not unilaterally through its own domestic judicial system\".338\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 11:19-25 to 12:1-12.\n\n204.\n\nHowever, the Claimant does not deny that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was \"de facto followed up to a point.\"339\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 9:8-10.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimant adds that, in any event, it is immaterial whether the Ukrtatnafta Treaty became effective or not since it was superseded by the Incorporation Agreement and its subsequent amendments. It argues that the Tribunal has already decided that these later agreements are the decisive legal instruments in the present case. Relying on paragraphs 188 and 195 of the Tribunal\u2019s Partial Award on Jurisdiction, the Claimant maintains that Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shareholders unanimously decided that the Incorporation Agreement and its subsequent amendments would ultimately regulate the nature and size of the contributions to be provided by the Tatarstan shareholders.340 According to the Claimant, the Respondent has not shown any basis for revisiting the decisions made in the Partial Award on Jurisdiction.341\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 9:16-25 to 10:1-19.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 11:3-6.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the invalidation of the Claimant\u2019s direct shareholdings in Case 17/178, as foreshadowed by Case 32/1, was reasonably tenable as a matter of Ukrainian law. It points out that there were seven court decisions on the merits in respect of Cases 32/1 and 17/178, and that tire judges involved in each decision took the position that the change in the Claimant\u2019s capital contribution to Ukrtatnafta violated the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and Ukrtatnafta\u2019s other founding documents.342\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 104:19-25 to 105:1-10.\n\n207.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Respondent states that, while it had accepted the possibility that the specific details concerning the contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders may have been varied,343 it would not have agreed to sign either the Ukrtatnafta Treaty or the Incorporation Agreement had It known that the contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders would have been other than oil fields and fixed assets related to oil wells, as was the case here.344 This intention is refected in the provisions of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty that concern the contribution from the Tatar side.345 Stating that the fundamental purpose of Ukrtatnafta was \"to serve as an inter-state economic complex with combined production and refining capabilities,\" the Respondent further alleges that it donated the Kremenchug refinery to Ukrtatnafta on the basis that it would receive oil ownership rights in Tatarstan oil deposits and related oil production equipment, which would have the effect of ensuring a minimum supply of oil to the Kremenchug refinery.346 In Case 32/1, the Kyiv Economic Court accepted this view.347\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 33.\n\nCounter-Memorial,

discusses whether the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was effective under international law or whether it was incorporated into domestic Ukrainian legislation348\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 117:24-25 to 118:1-5.\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondent first clarifies that \"under the Ukrainian regime, [the Ukrtatnafta Treaty] was effective as a matter of international law that binds the parties.\"\u2019349 First, Article 13 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, which pegs the effective date of the treaty as the \"date of the last notice of compliance by the Parties with their domestic procedures,\" is not clear about whether the treaty requires any further domestic procedure for it to take effect, but the Parties to the treaty did agree on immediate implementation without such a precondition.\"350 Second, while Article 2(3) of the Ukrainian Law on International Treaties assumes that international treaties are concluded on behalf of the Government of Ukraine, the Respondent explains that the distinction between those treaties and those that are concluded on behalf of Ukraine is merely internal and of no significance under international law.351 In any case, the CMU specifically cited Article 2(3) in their orders with regard to the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, which therefore places this treaty in the category of an international or intergovernmental treaty.352 Third, the CMU implemented the treaty, thereby signaling that the requirements of Article 13 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty had been met from the Ukrainian side.353 The Respondent points out that the Republic of Tatarstan also considered the intergovernmental treaty to be effective and did not otherwise invalidate or withdraw from it.\"354\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013). 121:22-24: Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6

forms an integral part of the domestic legal order of Ukraine through the \"doctrine of reference.\"355 The Respondent cites to the decisions in Cases 32/1 and 17/178 that constantly upheld the proposition that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was an integral part of Ukrainian legislation.356 It also points to several provisions in Ukrainian law that support this position, such as Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises, which states that \"[i]f an international treaty or an international agreement to which Ukraine is a party establishes rules other than those set out in the Ukrainian legislation on enterprises, the rules of the international treaty or agreement shall apply,\" and which does not specify that the ratification of a treaty is a precondition to its incorporation into domestic law.357 While a separate provision, Article 17 on the Ukrainian Law on International Treaties, states that \"[iInternational Agreements of Ukraine that are concluded and properly ratified constitute an integral part of the national legislation of Ukraine the Respondent clarifies that Article 17 refers to a category of intergovernmental treaties that is separate from the category covered by Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises.358\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 122:2-5; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b646.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 122:11-16.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013),

agreements of Ukraine which are not subject to ratification, but are subject to approval, are approved as follows...,\u2019359 the Respondent makes the following points. First, it is not clear whether Article 13 of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty requires approval In the form of some domestic procedure in order for it to be effective.\u2019360 Second, Article 9 does not Indicate that every treaty must be ratified or approved to be effective, and in fact, most of Ukraine\u2019s treaties are not ratified or approved.361 Third, the CMU does not issue separate approvals of treaties that it has signed, which means that the category in Article 9 that actually requires a separate signature by the CMU after its approval signature is a \"null set.\"362 And fourth, the approval for signature of the CMU of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, in conjunction with the powers of the CMU under the relevant legislation, operate to make the Ukrtatnafta Treaty binding as part of Ukrainian domestic legislation.363\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 124:13-16.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 124:21-25.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 125:1-6.\n\nTranscript(27 March 2013), 125:7-13.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 125:14-25 to 126:1-9.\n\n212.\n\nTurning then to the relevant cases, the Respondent first states that the courts in Cases 32/1 and 17/178 applied the systemic method of interpretation that is recognized by Ukrainian law364 and not the \"literal and fragmentary reading of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and related governing documents\" allegedly employed by the Claimant and its experts in their consideration of the Issue of the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings.365 It then discusses the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and other related documents that governed the establishment and operation of Ukrtatnafta\u2014which it stresses is not an ordinary Ukrainian joint stock company but is instead an inter-state economic complex that was established by a treaty366\u2014to establish the importance placed on the form of contributions by the founding members, which support the necessity of requiring governmental approval for any material change to the company\u2019s founding documents.367\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 215:11-16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 187.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 207:5-19,\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 184-185, 187-193, 195; Transcript (18 March 2013), 216:19-25 to 217:1; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 47.\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that the consent of the Ukrainian Government was indirectly given through SPFU.368 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the SPFU\u2019s approval at the 1997 and 1998 General Shareholders Meetings did not imply the approval of these changes under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, and moreover, the SPFU exceeded its authority in approving amendments to the Ukrtatnafta founding documents.369\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 206:3-7.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 196-197.\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Ukrainian courts\u2019 analysis and application of Article 8(3) of the Law of Ukraine \"On Securities and Stock Exchange\" in Case 17/178 was reasonably tenable, in that it was the change in the form of the Claimant\u2019s contribution to Ukrtatnafta that violated Article 8(3)\u2019s requirement that it pay for its shares, as the said article requires proper\u2014and not just any\u2014payment, which translates to payment in the form prescribed in Ukrtatnafta\u2019s governing documents.370\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 198-199.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondent highlights the multiplicity of judges, at different courts, who considered the merits of both Cases 32/1 and 17/178.371\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 196:17-25 to 197:1.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent further clarifies that the Economic Court of the Poltava Region did not order the restitution of the cash payment made by Tatneft for its shares because Tatneft did not seek such restitution, for what the Respondent describes as strategic reasons.372 The Respondent rejects the reliance of the Claimant\u2019s expert on the *Dekon* case as controlling authority for the proposition that courts should grant restitution even absent a request from the defendant that it do so, by explaining that *Dekon* contradicts the general trend of court decisions;\u2019373 that the Claimant\u2019s expert was only made aware of this case as a result of the Respondent\u2019s expert report;374 that the Ukrainian system does not recognize precedent in court cases;375 and that a 2005 Supreme Court decision contradicted the position in *Dekon.376* And lastly, the Respondent points out that Tatneft could have filed a counterclaim in the Ukrainian court proceedings to seek restitution, but failed to do so.377\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 225:24-25; 226:1-25, and 227:1.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 101:24-25 to 102:1-8.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 103:6-8.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 103:9-13.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 103:14-25.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 103:5-10.\n\n**2. The Tribunal's Considerations Concerning the Annulment of Tatneft\u2019s Shareholding in Ukrtatnafta**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to the discussion of the complex facts concerning the proceedings and decisions of the Ukrainian courts in respect of the validity of. the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta as summarized above. This was yet another step in the process of corporate confrontation surrounding this case and one in which, besides the role of the courts, that of the Prosecutor, several government officials and the Korsan group becomes a salient feature of its developments. Although the Respondent is of the view that the events related to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko are peripheral to the main issues with which the arbitration is concerned in light of the evolution of the case, and that there is no proximate cause between such events and the alleged damages, the Tribunal tends to see a rather close link between all such events as they were a part of the corporate struggle described and the end goal of the control of Ukrtatnafta changing hands.\n\n**(a) The Issues Concerning the Amendment of Tatneft\u2019s Capital Contribution**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nProceedings seeking the invalidation of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shareholders resolution approving the modification of the capital contribution of the Tatarstan shareholders and the valuation of Ukrtatnafta were commenced as it has been explained by the Prosecutor before the Kyiv Economic Court on 19 December 2007 giving birth to Case 32/1. The issue arose as a consequence of a letter addressed to the Prosecutor by the Minister of Fuel and Energy dated 28 April 2007 explaining that, in light of investigations carried out, the formation of the authorized capital of Ukrtatnafta was in violation of Ukrainian law. The said Minister believed that by revaluing the amount represented by Ukraine\u2019s contribution of the Kremenchug refinery to a figure three times smaller, and increasing the value of the Tatarstan-contributed shares by means of a changed capital structure, the control of the company appeared to be the objective pursued.378 The Tribunal must also note in this respect the Claimant\u2019s argument to the effect that the letter in question was sent by Minister Boyko, who prior to his ministerial position had been appointed Chairman of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Management Board in 2001, and was based on the alleged illegalities brought forward by a Member of Parliament whose identity is not disclosed379 and whose letter was not produced,380 aspects that cast doubt on the independence of the Ministry in the events that the letter triggered. Because of Mr. Boyko\u2019s prior appointment as Chairman of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Management Board it is likely, as Claimant argues, that he knew long before he sent the ministerial letter about the alleged illegalities.381\n\nLetter from the Minister of Fuel and Energy to the Public Prosecutor General of Ukraine, dated 28 April 2007 (REX-145).\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Liapka, \u00b6 18; Second Witness Statement of Liapka, \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\n*Id.*\n\n219.\n\nIn considering the question of the invalidation of the shareholders\u2019 resolution the Tribunal is mindful of two facts of importance. The first is that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty of Incorporation of 4 July 1995 had envisaged that the Tatarstan contribution to the company would consist of a guaranteed supply of oil with a certain minimum specified, just as the Agreement on Incorporation and Operation of Ukrtatnafta did. More specifically, the Presidential Decree of the Republic of Tatarstan dated 13 December 1994.382 envisaged as a capital contribution the shares it owned in certain economic entities concerned with oil production and the right to develop oil deposits, among other state-owned assets, so as to match the capital contribution of Ukraine, all of it in light of the concept of creating an integrated oil production and refining industry with the equal participation of Ukraine and Tatarstan. A number of other supplementary agreements and Orders had also relied on the equality of the contributions of the founding members, as the Kyiv City Economic Court concluded in its judgment of 4 September 2008 in Case 32/1 and as the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeals confirmed in its decision of 14 May 2009.\n\nDecree of the President of Tatarstan, Dec. 13, 1994 (REX-6).\n\n220.\n\nThe second fact that needs to be taken into account in the consideration of this issue is that in the end such form of capital contribution was changed because of various alleged technical, economic and legal difficulties and as it no longer appeared to respond to the intent of establishing a full cycle of oil extraction and processing extending from the oil wells in Tatarstan to the Kremenchug refining in Ukraine. As a result the Tatarstan shares in Tatneft and Tatnefteprom that were transferred were valued at US$ 103,575 million, the Tatneft contribution at US$ 1 million and the Zenit Bank shareholdings in trust for the latter company at US$ 30 million. In turn the supply of oil to Ukrtatnafta did not meet the amounts specified on a yearly basis.\n\n221.\n\nIn spite of the resolutions in question having evidently departed from the original conception of the \u2019project, the Tribunal cannot fail to note first that such modifications were unanimously approved by the shareholders. More importantly, a number of high level officers of the Ukraine government were present at the General Shareholders Meetings held in 1997 and 1998 and concurred in the unanimous approval of the modifications introduced. Among such officials there was the Minister of Fuel and Energy, the Director of the State Property Fund and the Deputy Minister of Finance. A list of twenty-four Ukrainian officials participating in Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Supervisory Board through 2007 was provided by the Claimant at the hearing during closing arguments.\n\n222.\n\nThe Prosecutor\u2019s statement of claim filed in Case 32/1383 explaining that the initiation of the proceedings found its justification in \"the injury caused to the economic interests of the State by the inefficient use of state-owned assets\" does not seem to find support in the facts noted. It is not quite credible that each and every State official participating in the approval of the resolutions would have been unaware of such inefficiency had that been the case. Although the view that there is no evidence of tire approval of the amendments in question by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine or another authorized state agency has been put forth, the fact that all relevant ministries and agencies participated in the shareholders meetings noted appears as a sufficient manifestation of governmental authority to that effect. The Claimant argues with good reason that such official participation in the approval of the resolutions in question was enough to trigger the three-year prescription period that will be discussed below. The view expressed to the effect that such officials could only provide their comments in the pertinent meetings in a personal capacity is simply not tenable.384\n\nStatement of Claim filed by the Ukrainian Prosecutor General\u2019s office on 19 December 2007 in the Case 32/1 (C-1271.\n\nTranscript (26 March 2013), 116:1-25 to 117:1-13.\n\n223.\n\nAt this point the Tribunal must note two troubling points in the developments taking place in connection with the amendment of capital contributions. The first is that the Prosecutor had already investigated Ukrtatnafta\u2019s foundation in the period 2002-2003, that is several years after the amendments had been introduced, but it was not until 2007 that proceedings were initiated on the argument that the letter to the Prosecutor by the Minister of Fuel and Energy following an audit control had prompted this action. While the delay might not be entirely unusual in a public service, this fact coincides with the second troubling point, namely that Korsan, the company controlled by the Privat Group, had acquired in January 2007 a 1% shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. From this point onwards the role of the Prosecutor in this case appears increasingly questionable and the relationship between the proceedings initiated and the interests of Korsan or related companies becomes significantly connected in their timing.\n\n**(b) The Issues Concerning the Statute of Limitations**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe arguments discussed became particularly relevant in the context of the discussion of the statute of limitations by the courts. The Prosecutor\u2019s statement of claim in Case 32/1 affirmed that he had not been aware of the violations of Ukrainian law allegedly taking place in connection with the amendment of capital contributions until he received the letter noted of the Minister of Fuel and Energy in 2007, thus justifying the Prosecutor\u2019s submission that the three-year limitation period established in Article 71 of the Ukrainian Civil Code should not apply. This statement of claim was promptly supported by Korsan in a submission to the Kyiv Economic Court. This Court concluded in its judgment of 4 September 2008 that it was \"obvious\" that the Prosecutor only learnt of such violations on the occasion of the Minister\u2019s letter and a report from the Main Auditing Office.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the matter was less than obvious.385 This is so first because the Claimant has produced evidence to the effect that the Cabinet of Ministers in an application before the courts of 5 August 2010 concerning Case 32/1 stated that the Prosecutor General\u2019s office knew all the circumstances relating to Ukrtatnafta\u2019s authorized capital \"back in 2003.\"386 The Tribunal cannot fail to note that the very fact that this application opposing annulment originated in the Ukrainian government is demonstrative of how the Respondent itself was not satisfied with the conclusions of the courts. It is also significant that the Kyiv Economic Court denied Seagroup\u2019s petition for the production of documents concerning the inspections of Ukrtatnafta by the Prosecutor General\u2019s office that were conducted during the preceding years. A letter from the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine dated 25 November 2003,387 also submitted in evidence by the Claimant, shows that in fact the Prosecutor had been monitoring the process of capital contributions with anticipation, including the Prosecutor\u2019s Claim filed in 2002 in Case 8/604, in which invalidation of the Ukrtatnafta Agreement was sought insofar as the procedure for the payment of shares was concerned.388 The Claimant convincingly explains that in seeking to annul Article 5(5) of the Incorporation Agreement in 2002 in respect of AmRuz and Seagroup, the Prosecutor necessarily knew then about the question concerning paragraph 3 of the same article authorizing Tatneft to pay in cash its capital contribution just as it authorized Tatarstan to pay its own contribution with shares in Tatneftprom.389\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 58:23-25 to 61 d-9.\n\nApplication for Review of Court Decisions upon Discovery of New Facts of 5 August 2010 (C-457 Corr,).\n\nProsecutor's Letter of 25 November 2003 (C-460).\n\nStatement of Claim in Case 8/604 of 16 September 2002 (C-294).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 32. 390\n\n226.\n\nIn its judgment of *4* September 2008 the Kyiv Economic Court concluded that because the Prosecutor had only learnt in 2007 about the breach of Ukrainian law allegedly committed by the change in the capital contributions of tire Company the excuse invoked by the Prosecutor for missing the limitation period was admissible and the rights of the State were liable to protection. This Tribunal does not sit as a reviewer of the decisions of Ukrainian courts but it must nonetheless examine the merits of those excuses in light of their relevance to the resolution of the instant dispute.\n\n227.\n\nArticle 71 of the Ukrainian Civil Code provides unequivocally for a general limitation period of three years for the protection of infringed rights. In accordance with Article 76 of that Code such period begins from the date the right to claim comes into existence, with specific reference to the right of action beginning from the date that person is aware or should have known of the violation of its rights. It is only when the limitation period is missed for a material reason that the action may he admissible and the right in question shall be entitled to protection, as provided for under Article 80(2) of the Civil Code.390\n\nExpert Report of Martinenko, \u00b6 14.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimant has convincingly explained in this context that the late letter of the Minister of Fuel and Energy to the Prosecutor is not a material reason justifying the dispensation of the limitation period because it does not show that there could have been an \"objectively insurmountable\" obstacle preventing a party from bringing an action in defense of its rights. The Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that there is no need to show objective impossibility as a ground for the renewal of the limitations period391 is at odds with the specific provisions of the Civil Code on this matter. While the Respondent rightly points out that a material reason is not the same as impossibility and that the two should not be equated, as Mr. Toms states in his reports and testimony392 it does not appear to be enough that a court will consider itself satisfied that there is a valid excuse for failing to file on time as this is an entirely discretionary appreciation that cannot be reconciled with the need to apply a legal standard. This could lead to the extreme view that the protection of rights does not require the affected person to comply with any formal condition, including compliance with the limitations period.393\u2019 whereas total discretion of the courts, as a legal expert maintains,394 is incompatible with a legal standard.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6 21; Transcript (26 March 203 3), 25:17-25 to 26:1-21.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 39; Second Expert Report of Toms, at 6: Witness Testimony of Toms, Transcript(26 March 2013),22:13-25 to 26:1-21.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, at 51\n\nFirst Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6 14, at 75-76.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal considers, moreover, that it is the duty of the Prosecutor General to keep abreast of situations which have been the subject of an investigation and in this case the evidence adduced to the effect that he had investigated the capital contributions as early as 2002-2003 is demonstrative of the fact that such officer knew, or should have known, of the alleged problems subject to a late claim in 2007.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that the knowledge of public officials could not be imputed to the Prosecutor because his function is to protect State interests without representing any State organ, and consequently only his knowledge is relevant for the purposes of the statute of limitations,395 does not appear to be in accordance with the institutional role of public officers whose duties go far beyond any question of personal knowledge, particularly in view of the broad role the Prosecutor has under Ukrainian law.396 Moreover, when the Prosecutor is acting on behalf of a claimant there would be no reason for granting that officer a more privileged role.397 The legal experts, Mr. Toms and Mr. Belyanevich, have debated the issue of whether there is in Ukraine legal support for the concept of imputed knowledge,398 but this is a question that is closer to a factual determination than to any legal standard.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6 41.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Toms, \u00b6 27.\n\nExpert Report of Martinenko, \u00b6 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 38.\n\n231.\n\nNeither is the argument that earlier investigations had not been concerned with the question of capital contributions under the Treaty and consequently that there could have been no knowledge at that time of the issues with which the Prosecutor was concerned as from 2007 any more convincing. In fact, while again it is true that the questions investigated in 2003 were not as complete as those prompting the 2007 investigation,399 it is also true that at that early stage the issue of amending the capital contributions was already quite prominent in the structure of Ukrtatnafta. The Prosecutor could not have ignored it or assumed that an oversight on his part would not have consequences.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 37.\n\n232.\n\nThe Tribunal does not doubt that in assessing time periods the courts enjoy a measure of discretion but this has its limits as established by law.400 The statute of limitations is one such important limit and cannot remain open indefinitely as would be the consequence of requiring personal knowledge of the Prosecutor to trigger it as the Respondent believes to be the ease.401 Even less so could the application of the limitation period in cases filed by the Prosecutor in the interests of the State be treated with greater deference than in any other case,402 nor could it be treated in a privileged manner,\n\nExpert Report of Martinenko, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.34-37,\n\nWitness Testimony of Belyanevich, Transcript (26 March 2013), 110:19-25 to 111:1-7,\n\nSecond Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n233.\n\nIf these were isolated cases one might consider that the interpretation of the courts is tenable as far as the limitation period is concerned, just like the Prosecutor must be presumed to act in good faith, but in the context of this dispute the facts and circumstances on which it rests show a string of actions seeking the same corporate objective within the struggle for the control of Ukrtatnafta that has been explained. In spite of there being no definition of materiality under the law or jurisprudence, as argued by the Respondent, it appears not to be unwarranted to conclude that the requirement of materiality was not strictly examined and that its normal legal meaning was certainly exceeded in the conclusions of the courts.\n\n234.\n\nHaving declared the action admissible, the Court then proceeded to rule that the change in the capital contributions and the corresponding modification of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s constituent documents were illegal, set aside the resolutions of the General Shareholders Meeting discussed, and ordered the cancellation of the company from the trade register to be followed by liquidation. The various appeals and other actions noted before the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal, the Higher Economic Court and the Supreme Court did not change the essence of the decision of 4 September 2008, except that the order to cancel the Company from the trade register and to liquidate it was reversed.\n\n235.\n\nThese judicial developments were followed soon afterwards by various other actions before the courts, all of them concerning different aspects of the changed capital contributions to Ukrtatnafta. Case 17/1 was filed by Ukrtatnafta on 18 December 2008 requesting the invalidation of the shareholdings of the Republic of Tatarstan in the Company in view of its contribution having been changed from Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shareholdings in the economic oil refining complex of that Republic to shares in Tatneftprom. Mr. Ovcharenko signed this filing on behalf of Ukrtatnafta. The various court decisions concerning this claim that have been noted above again dealt with the renewal of the limitation period and the invalidation of the share purchase agreement of Tatarstan in Ukrtatnafta which, with the exception of one decision reversing prior findings, reiterated in essence the approach that had been followed in Case 32/1.\n\n236.\n\nThe most prominent of the cases that followed was Case 17/178 where most of the issues discussed were again decided by the courts on grounds similar to those considered in Case 32/1. In this new case the Economic Court of the Poltava Region decided on 3 November 2009 that the actions brought by Ukrtatnafta against Tatneft seeking the invalidation of the latter\u2019s purchase of shares were not time barred because the claimant did not have the power to seek the annulment of such purchase agreements until Case 32/1 was decided. This proposition is not supported in light of the facts of the case as Ukrtatnafta, even if it might not have been able to bring an action against its own shareholders, could have sought the protection of its rights at any material time following the share transactions believed to be in breach of the law and in particular could have challenged the contracts emanating from those resolutions.403\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 40, with reference to the Witness Testimony of Toms, Transcript (26 March 2013), 30:14-17.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot fail to note the Claimant\u2019s argument to the effect that Ukrtatnafta, in seeking the invalidation of Tatneft\u2019s share purchase agreement, ignored the resolutions passed by the General Meeting of its own shareholders, which is hardly credible and could thus not support the view that the company learnt of such an event years later.\n\n238.\n\nThe Prosecutor\u2019s arguments in justification of this late filing are identical to those made earlier in Case 32/1 insofar it affirms that it had only become aware of the breach of Ukrainian law in 2007. This argument was also accepted by the Economic Court of the Poltava Region which allowed the case to proceed. Again here, however, the Claimant in the instant case convincingly explains that the Prosecutor knew of the amendments as early as 2002 in the context of his initiation of Case 8/604 against AmRuz and Seagroup seeking to annul Article 5 of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s 1995 Incorporation Agreement. This fact is clearly indicative that there could be no material reason to renew the limitation period as required under the Civil Code. The issue of a material reason and impossibility to file on time will be discussed further below in light of the expert legal reports of Mr. Toms and Mr. Belyanevich.\n\n**(c) The Discussion of the Alleged Illegality of Amended Capital Contributions and Invalidation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Court in Case 17/178 reached the conclusion that the shareholders\u2019 resolutions accepting the modification that allowed Tatneft to substitute cash payments for the oil wells and supply originally envisaged by the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and other enactments was unlawful and consequently invalidated Tatneft\u2019s share purchase, ordering the return of such shares to Ukrtatnafta. Contribution in kind, in the view of the Court, was as essential as the contribution of the Kremenchug refinery made by the SPFU in due course. In addition, the Court concluded that because the shares bought had not been paid in full, as required by Article 8(3) of the Law of Ukraine \" On Securities and Exchange,\" this condition had also been breached and on this basis it set aside the 1998 Option Agreement between Ukrtatnafta and Zenit Bank and the transfers that led to Tatneft\u2019s shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. The appeals and cassation that followed this decision were not successful.\n\n240.\n\nIn deciding Case 17/178 the Economic Court of the Poltava Region enumerated the provisions that had in its opinion been breached by Tatneft\u2019s share purchases. These provisions include those in the Ukrainian Constitution, the Civil Code, the Presidential Decree of 1994 on the establishment of Ukrtatnafta, the 1995 resolution of the CMU concerning the Treaty establishing Ukrtatnafta and the Treaty itself.'404 The Tribunal can only note in disbelief that if in fact all these violations had been committed no one, particularly no government service, had ever raised questions before judicial proceedings were commenced a decade later.\n\nFirst Expert Report by Toms, \u00b6\u00b6 44-77.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot fail to notice that the sequence of court decisions concerning the question of capital contributions led with each step to a situation more unfavourable to Tatneft. While Case 32/1 in ordering to cancel Ukrtatnafta from the trade register and thereafter proceeding to the liquidation of the Company would have undone the venture altogether, this order was the only aspect of the judgment that was ultimately reversed on appeal, consequently allowing Ukrtatnafta to survive. Case 17/178, in invalidating the share transfers that had allowed for Tatneft\u2019s participation and ordering the return of such shares to Ukrtatnafta, dramatically changed the shareholdings in the Company to the detriment of one party and the benefit of the other. This, however, as it will be seen, would not be the last step in the sequence.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal, while again not pretending to sit in review of the courts\u2019 decisions, must reach its own conclusions as to whether the modification of the capital contributions was illegal as this aspect is of significant importance for the present dispute. The Parties do not dispute that the capital contributions were changed in light of the General Shareholders Meetings resolutions discussed. Cash was substituted for twenty-two oil fields and the supply of specific volumes of oil. The justification for such modification, related to problems concerning costs and the Tatarstan legislation in force at the time, does not appear to be quite convincing, at least in light of the substitute value that was contributed, but it is also a fact that such reasons were never questioned at the time and, on the contrary, the modifications were unanimously approved, including with the concurring vote of the Ukrainian public officials noted.\n\n243.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal can accept the Claimant\u2019s argument to the effect that the specific wording of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and Decree No. 704/94 of the President of Ukraine, like that of other related enactments, is not entirely clear as to the scope of the obligations it sets in connection with capital contributions, it is quite evident that the new scheme of capital contributions was not that originally envisaged in the establishment of Ukrtatnafta. Neither are these instruments entirely clear about which governmental bodies were entrusted with the responsibility of authorizing amendments to Ukrtatnafta\u2019s constituent documents.\n\n244.\n\nBoth the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and that of Tatarstan, as stated by the Court in Case 17/178, were indeed entrusted with the establishment of the Company. The Court concluded in that case that any amendments to the constitutive instruments of Ukrtatnafta had also to be made in accordance with the agreement of the authorities whose acts established the Company. While approval of the constitutive instruments and decisions related thereto, like the initial capital contributions and the transfers of State assets, were indeed assigned to the respective Council of Ministers, the powers concerning corporate governance and administration did not necessarily follow the same route as they belong to the normal functions of a joint-stock company under their constituent documents.405 There was thus a dual authority governing the Company, one under the aegis of political bodies and the other under the powers of the organs of the corporate structure governing the Company.\n\nExpert Report by Martinenko, \u00b6 56.\n\n245.\n\nThe Court in Case 17/178 appears to have taken into consideration just the first kind of powers but not the responsibility of the corporate organs in governing the Company. The Claimant points out in this respect that under Article 16.2 of the 1995 Agreement on the establishment of the Company it is the shareholders meetings that are empowered to modify and amend the Agreement and the Charter, with the sole requirement being that this be done in writing and sisned by the authorized representatives of each Founder, a provision which also accords with the 1991 Law on Business Associations of Ukraine which entrusts the general meeting of shareholders with modifications of the corporate charter.406 It is also argued in this respect that neither the Ukrtatnafta Treaty nor the 1994 Presidential Decree contained any prohibition or restriction of this power.\n\nFirst Expert Report by Tonis, \u00b6\u00b6 94,103; Second Expert Report by Toms, at 20-21.\n\n246.\n\nIt has now to be determined whether the amendment of capital contributions pertains to the powers of public bodies as held by the Court in Case 17/178, and hence can only be approved by such bodies, or whether the amendment ought to be considered an aspect concerning the powers of corporate governance and can thus be approved by the shareholders meetings as was done in the instant case. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that capital contributions, while at their origins might be determined by the political bodies of the participating countries, in the course of events that follow in the life of a company might be a matter for decision of the corporate bodies, unless specific restrictions have been written in to this end. The Tribunal is mindful that in its Partial Award on Jurisdiction it decided that the relations between Ukrtatnafta and Tatneft were in the nature of business relations and this is the very rationale that determines that the issue now under consideration has to be decided under the rules of corporate governance.\n\n247.\n\nThe fact that Ukrtatnafta was established by Treaty and conceived at its origins as a single interstate economic complex, as indicated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Tatarstan in its Resolution No. 05-39/4101407 and as the background of the creation of the Company clearly shows, does not detract from the fact that its general shareholders meetings were entrusted with the specific task of managing the company and this indeed includes the question of changes in capital contributions. If a shareholders meeting decides, for example, to increase the capitalization of the company to attain new corporate objectives this would fall squarely within such organ\u2019s powers. The amendments concerning capital contributions are not in essence different, particularly if approved by the representatives of the founding members in the shareholders meetings so deciding, as was very much the case here.\n\nSecond Expert Report by Buromenskiy, Exhibit MVB-50 at 1.\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent\u2019s views to the contrary but it is not persuaded that they can justify a different conclusion in this aspect of the dispute. Whether the Court\u2019s interpretation in Case 17/178 is reasonably tenable as a matter of Ukrainian law might be true, but this is only so if the amendments concern an aspect of the Treaty that evidently pertains to the public aspects of the establishment of the Company, as would be the case, for example, if the shareholders were to decide to invite a third State to participate in Ukrtatnafta. But it is not quite so if the amendments concern other kinds of powers. Without meaning any criticism to the judgment in question, the conclusion that in the best of cases it is incomplete is inescapable. In any event, the Tribunal needs to be mindful of the Claimant\u2019s argument to the effect that even if some acts might be in conformity with Ukrainian Law they cannot be invoked in justification of a failure to perform the BIT as a matter of principle under international law.\n\n249.\n\nWhether the Ukrainian government would not have signed the Treaty or the Incorporation Agreement had it understood that capital contributions could be later amended is a matter of speculation that cannot influence this Tribunal\u2019s findings. The Tribunal does not disagree with the view that Ukraine\u2019s contribution of the Kremenchug refinery was conceived as the counterpart of the Tatarstan\u2019s contribution of the oil wells, but cannot ignore the fact that such understanding changed in light of the concurrence of representatives of all founding members in the shareholders meetings in approving the changes later perceived as necessary. Whether the SPFU exceeded its powers in so approving, as also argued by the Respondent, does not change this conclusion and it is a matter of internal responsibilities that cannot be imputed to the detriment of the Claimant\u2019s rights under the BIT.\n\n**(d) Questions Concerning the Enactment of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal must discuss at this point one important aspect on which the Parties have relied in support of their respective arguments, namely the question of whether the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was in force. As noted above the Claimant believes that the Treaty was not in force and thus could not be the basis on which the courts grounded their conclusions to undo the share arrangements agreed by the investors and the corporate bodies that intervened in these capital restructurings.408 In the Claimant\u2019s view, the \"Treaty\" was not an agreement between two States and therefore it does not qualify as a proper treaty under international law, and in any event the procedures provided under Article 13 of the Treaty for entry into force were not complied with as there is no record of a notification by the Parties in compliance with their domestic procedures, a situation which is also incompatible with the then applicable Ukrainian Law on International Agreements.\n\nSecond Expert Report by Toms, at 24-25.\n\n251.\n\nHad the Treaty been in force, the Claimant further maintains, the courts of Ukraine would have lacked jurisdiction to deal with the disputes as they should have been submitted to the dispute settlement procedures of Article 11 of the Treaty. Although the Treaty could have been de facto followed in some respects, for all legal and practical purposes it was the Incorporation Agreement as amended that governed the powers and operations of Ukrtatnafta, with particular reference to the question of capital contributions, which in the Claimant\u2019s view would mean that whether the Treaty was effective or not is immaterial.\n\n252.\n\nIt has also been explained above that in the Respondent\u2019s view the Treaty duly came into force as the Parties agreed on its immediate implementation thus making unnecessary any further domestic proceedings. The fact that the Ukrainian Council of Ministers implemented the Treaty is in itself, according to the Respondent, evidence that the Treaty was properly an intergovernmental agreement and there is no reason to distinguish this type of treaty from other categories which Ukrainian Law envisaged for domestic purposes that are of no relevance under international law. The Tatarstan Republic at all times also considered the Treaty to be an intergovernmental agreement.\n\n253.\n\nAs also explained above, the Respondent also asserts that at all times it has considered the Treaty as a part of the domestic legal order and this would be the case even if the Treaty is not considered to be effective under international law. Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises also recognizes the prevalence of the provisions of international agreements over domestic law. A similar understanding is explained in connection with the reference that Article 17 of the Law on International Treaties makes to a different category of intergovernmental treaties as constituting a part of the national legislation. This last law distinguishes between treaties subject to ratification and others subject to approval; in practice most of Ukraine\u2019s treaties do not follow either of these alternatives and are considered in effect after they have been signed.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty of 4 July 1995 was properly a treaty under international law, as has convincingly been explained by the expert opinion of Professor Buromenskiy.409 Mr. Toms\u2019 legal assessment of this question is wrong under international law as the Respondent has pointed out.410 It is necessary to bear in mind in this respect that under Article 2.1(a) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties the definition of a treaty is a broad one, being required that it be concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and \"whatever its particular designation.\" The Ukrtatnafta Treaty was in fact concluded between States, Ukraine on the one hand and the Republic of Tatarstan on the other, and the fact that the latter is a Republic of the Russian Federation in no way detracts from its governmental character, as frequently autonomous republics within a federal State have the power to enter into treaties concerning their international relations in matters of their competence, as appears to be the case for the Republic of Tatarstan411 in spite of bow some uncertainty might exist in this respect.412 The status of Ukrtatnafta as a \"single interstate economic complex\" governed by the Treaty, as noted in the letter of the Tatarstan authorities to Ukraine of 3 August 2004,413 is the kind of competence that pertains to such autonomous Republic.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Buromenskiy, \u00b6 27.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 42-47.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Buromenskiy, \u00b6\u00b6 27-42.\n\nTranscript (26 March 2013), 90:20-25 to 93:1-6.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Buromenskiy, Exhibit MVB-50.\n\n255.\n\nAt no point was the issue that the Republic of Tatarstan might not have qualified as a State for the purpose of the Treaty raised before this case was brought. The intergovernmental nature of this Treaty is accordingly well established and it is properly included in the list of treaties entered into by this Republic414 and, as the Respondent notes, no notice of termination has been issued.415\n\nFirst Expert Report of Buromenskiy, Exhibit MVB-10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Slides, 39.\n\n256.\n\nThe question discussed by the Parties as to whether the Treaty became effective as stipulated in its Article 13 on the date of the last notice of compliance by the Parties with theft respective domestic procedures is an aspect that in essence depends on domestic law rather than international law.416 Each Party is free to follow its own domestic procedures and for that matter its practice is particularly relevant in this connection.417 The Claimant\u2019s view to the effect that Ukraine never gave notice of having complied with its procedures, just as it appears that Tatarstan also did not do, does not affect the binding nature of the Treaty if the intention of the Parties was so to be understood. The fact that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine instructed a Vice-Minister to sign the Treaty on behalf of the government and issued the corresponding Resolution No. 487 of 4 July 1995 has been well established by Mr. Mityukov, the official entrusted with this task.418 More importantly, the government proceeded to implement the Treaty and comply with its provisions, including the nomination of the Supervisory Board, thus further evidencing the understanding that the Treaty was binding. The same holds true for the Ukrtatnafta Charter and its Incorporation Agreement of 23 July 1995, both of which are again founded on the Treaty.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Buromenskiy, \u00b6 99-115.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Buromenskiy, \u00b6 67.\n\nWitness Statement of Mityukov, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12; Witness Testimony of Mityukov, Transcript (20 March 2013), 135:1-17.\n\n257.\n\nThe meaning of the Ukrainian domestic legislation on treaties thus has a limited role in the context of this dispute, mainly related to the internal procedures to be followed in respect of some categories of treaties. Article 2(3) of the Law on International Treaties appears to address the question of executive agreements as it refers to international treaties on \"economical, trade, scientific, technical and other matters belonging to governmental competence.\" which are to be concluded on behalf of the Government and which according to Article 9 of this Law are approved by way of a resolution, that is also a simplified procedure. Other kinds of treaties are also distinguished by Article 17 of this Law when referring to the international agreements of Ukraine that are concluded and properly ratified. As the Respondent has argued these distinctions are of interest only for domestic purposes and do not affect the status of the respective agreements under international law. In fact, while approval suffices for the first category, more formal procedures of ratification are eventually necessary for the second type of treaties. This situation is common to many countries and those procedures do not really change the nature of the treaty concerned.\n\n258.\n\nThe practice in this respect is solely a domestic question. By its very nature the Ukrtatnafta Treaty can well be considered an executive agreement establishing the \"single interstate economic complex\" described above. It thus follows that the requirements for approval are entirely a choice for domestic law and practice, which may even dispense with any particular procedure as long as the intention to comply with the agreement is manifest, as is the case here. Interestingly, the Respondent has explained that in the Ukrainian treaty practice at least 85% of the treaties in effect are not ratified, many of which are not approved either.419\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Slides, 54.\n\n259.\n\nAn issue related to the effectiveness of the Treaty is whether the Ukrainian courts would be competent to deal with disputes under this instrument. As noted, the Claimant believes that if the Treaty is in effect, only the dispute settlement procedures of its Article 11 should govern and the Ukrainian courts would be incompetent in this respect. The Tribunal considers that there are two sides to this question. The first is that concerning intergovernmental disputes which are naturally governed by the Treaty. This also explains why finally this dispute has been brought under the Russia-Ukraine BIT, again an intergovernmental treaty under which investors have rights of action to protect their interests. The second side is that concerning the question of the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty under domestic law, which is an aspect related io the administration and operation of the company as a corporate entity.\n\n260.\n\nIn spite of the issues of dual authority that have been discussed in respect of corporate governance, these properly belong to the implementation of the Treaty and disputes related thereto are thus subject to domestic judicial intervention, provided the guarantees of protection envisaged under the BIT are satisfied, which is the question that has been brought to this Tribunal. In this respect, the finding of the Ukrainian courts to the effect that the Treaty is a part of Ukrainian legislation is correct, as this will also be the normal consequence of an international legal obligation, including the prevalence of these obligations over domestic rules in case of contradiction, as Article 4 of the Law on Enterprises clearly establishes. Whether the treaty in question is brought into effect by means of approval, ratification or otherwise, the\n\n261.\n\nThe question the Tribunal must still answer is whether the fact that the Treaty is in effect changes the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions as to the meaning of the capital contributions originally envisaged and the powers to have these contributions changed as per the decisions of the company\u2019s governing bodies, most notably through the General Shareholders Meeting. It has been explained above that the amendments introduced to capital contributions, while different from those originally envisaged, are of a kind pertaining to the administration of the company as a commercial entity and do not fall under the elements of the public governance of Ukrtatnafta as happens with other matters, such as would be the case explained of bringing in a State party not counted among the original parties to the Treaty. It follows that those conclusions stand and that accordingly the amendments introduced are not in breach of the Treaty or for that matter of Ukrainian legislation in view of how the original capital contributions were neither entirely clear nor understood to be permanent and not subject to amendment.420 On this point the Tribunal is also mindful of paragraph 188 of the Partial Award on Jurisdiction. In respect of this conclusion, the Tribunal does not agree with those arrived at by the expert international law report of Professor Buromenskiy, who believes that an amendment concerning the nature of contributions is contrary to the Treaty421 unless approved at an interstate level.422\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 40.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Buromenskiy, \u00b6\u00b6 157-170.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Buromenskiy. \u00b6\u00b6 43-48.\n\n**(e) A Systematic Adverse Line of Decisions and the Role of the Prosecutor General**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe performance of the Company following the changes in capital contributions does not appear to have been affected by the amendments and would prove, as the Claimant argues in opposition to the Respondent, that the objectives of the Company could be achieved all the same and that the contribution of oil wells and equipment was not an essential condition for the creation of Ukrtatnafta.\n\n263.\n\nThe Parties have argued about whether the systemic method of interpretation applied by the courts, which the Respondent considers appropriate, or the literary and fragmentary reading of the pertinent instruments, which it believes the Claimant to support, also justifies the conclusions of those courts. The Tribunal is all in favor of a systemic method of interpretation and it is precisely in this light that the aggregate of legal instruments relevant to this dispute show that one thing was the original intent of the parties and quite another was how perceptions changed in the course of events and materialized in agreements that responded to such perceptions, again with the feature of having been unanimously approved.\n\n264.\n\nIt should be noted that arguments have also been made to the effect that the Courts\u2019 interpretation of Article 8(3) of the Law \"On Securities and Stock Exchange\" is right or wrong. The Claimant believes that this provision could only have been triggered if no contribution had been made at all while the Respondent maintains that it was the change in the form of payment that violated the Article in question and not the issue of whether a contribution was made or not.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the fact that on many occasions national courts tend to take a position on given points of fact and law that are the most favorable to the national interest involved in a dispute. To the extent that this approach can be justified in light of its compatibility with the ordinary meaning of governing provisions it might be considered tenable and cannot be a point of criticism. When this exercise, however, results in systematic decisions against the rights of the other party, and the latter\u2019s arguments might be considered equally tenable, there is reason to believe that the process might have run astray of due process and the necessary impartiality in delivering justice.\n\n266.\n\nThe various cases that have been examined above show that the line of reasoning followed by the courts was, save for occasional exceptions, systematically adverse to the rights of the Claimant. The Tribunal has not ruled out that some aspects of those decisions might be tenable in light of the facts or the applicable law, but it also believes that a number of the arguments of the Claimant are also tenable and hence would have merited due consideration. This situation calls into question the independence with which the courts proceeded in such cases and casts a serious doubt about whether there was any intention to examine the rights claimed so as to impartially rule on their eventual merit.\n\n267.\n\nHad such decisions been the outcome of completely separate proceedings on issues of fact and law one could readily admit that the claimants in such proceedings were simply wrong. But as has been noted, almost every decision adopted resulted in a sequence that was with each step more adverse to the Claimant and directly leading to findings that would in the end deprive it of all rights in the Company. Furthermore, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that all such proceedings were linked by a common thread that found its origins in the systematic role of the Prosecutor in the unfolding of this dispute.\n\n268.\n\nAll the relevant cases were initiated by requests that the Prosecutor brought to the courts, invariably seeking to reopen matters in respect of which limitation periods had long become applicable. In the view of this Tribunal, the arguments in support of such requests were for the most part unconvincing and on occasions contradicted by the Prosecutor\u2019s own actions. Neither can the Tribunal overlook the fact that such requests acquired momentum immediately following the acquisition by Korsan of a 1% shareholding in the Company, a process which ended in the prominent role that Korsan has today in its shareholding composition. As in many countries, the Prosecutor performs an influential State service and has strong influence in the administration of justice.\n\n**C.

The facts relating to this other aspect of the dispute will be examined next.\n\n**(a) Undisputed Facts**\n------------------------\n\n270.\n\nIn August 2001, the SPFU filed a lawsuit against Ukrtatnafta and all of its shareholders before the Kyiv Economic Court to set aside the share purchase agreements entered into by each of AmRuz and Seagroup with Ukrtatnafta on the basis that the contracts violated the legal ' requirement that the shares of the founding shareholders be paid for within one year and that Ukrainian law barred the use of promissory notes to pay for these shares, in what were to become Cases 28/198 and 28/199, respectively.424 Tatneft entered the case as a third party in opposition to the claims.425\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 28; Memorial, \u00b6 245; Transcript (18 March 2013), 163:16-22.\n\nTranscript (IS March 2013), 162:22-25.\n\n271.\n\nThe Kyiv Economic Court upheld the SPFU\u2019s claims for both cases on 28 November 2001.426 The Court found that the use of promissory notes to purchase shares violated Article 13 of the Company Law,427 which excluded promissory notes from the kinds of assets that could be used to contribute to the charter capital of a company.428 ft also found that the addenda to the share purchase agreements that were entered into between Ukrtatnafta and AmRuz and Seagroup, respectively, had the effect of extending the deadline for AinRuz and Seagroup to make their capital contributions to Ukrtatnafta beyond that imposed by Articles 11 and 33 of the Company Law, as well as Ukrtatnafta\u2019s Incorporation Agreement and Charter.429 The Court therefore nullified the share purchase agreements entered into with AmRuz and Seagroup, respectively, and ordered that AmRuz and Seagroup return their shares to Ukrtatnafta.430 The Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment on 14 March 2002.431\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 246; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 116.\n\nUkrainian Company Law, Article 13 (C-297).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 246-247.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 246-247.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 248.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 249; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 117; both citing to the Judgments of the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal, 14 March 2002, in Cases 28/198 and 28/199 fC-323 and C-324).

confirmed that AmRuz and Seagroup had paid for their Ukrtatnafta shares once they had transferred the notes; and thereby rejected Naftogaz\u2019s argument that AmRuz and Seagroup had failed to pay half of their contribution before the first general shareholders\u2019 meeting.442 On 1 April 2005, the Kyiv Economic Court dismissed the appeal of Naftogaz against this decision.443 On 6 September 2005, the Higher Economic Court, in considering the cassation appeal lodged by Naftogaz, rejected all but one of the grounds for appeal raised by Naftogaz,444 a decision which was later set aside by the Supreme Court of Ukraine on 18 April 2006, in response to a cassation appeal filed by AmRuz and Seagroup.445\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 261-262.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 264-265.\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 57.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 267.\n\n276.\n\nOn 24 January 2008, the Prosecutor lodged an extraordinary cassation appeal with the Supreme Court of Ukraine to set aside the 29 May 2002 decisions of the Higher Economic Court and reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199446\u2014citing to Article 111(15) of the Code of Commercial Procedure then in force, which authorized the reopening of a case decided by the Higher Economic Court if that court had applied the same legal provision differently in similar cases447 \u2014on the basis of Case 45/383 *Northland Power Darnytia Inc.* v. *Ukrnaftogaz OJSC ^Northland Power'\u2019)* dated 14 November 2006.448 Because Article 111(16) of the Code of Commercial Procedure required the cassation appeal to be filed within a month from the relevant decision, the Prosecutor invoked Article 53 of the Code of Commercial Procedure, which allowed the filing of this cassation appeal beyond one month for \"justifiable reasons.\"449\n\nJoint Factual Chronology, \u00b6 116.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 272;

This principle was, in the Claimant\u2019s view, not intended to extend beyond the incorporation of Ukrtatnafta.466 Hence, the purchase of Ukrtatnafta shares at a later point in time by AmRuz and Seagroup\u2014both of whom were incorporated neither in Ukraine nor in Tatarstan\u2014could not have breached this requirement.467\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 228; Transcript (27 March 2013), 10:11-19.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 228.\n\n282.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent argues that the acquisition of AmRuz and Seagroup of Ukrtatnafta shares, which gave them an 18% collective interest in Ukrtatnafta, in addition to what it characterizes as their almost instant alliance with the Tatarstan shareholders, was a substantial breach of the parity principle, which was a fundamental basis of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty.468\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.57.\n\nii.

CJSC Energy Generating Company Ukr-Can Power\" (Kyiv) and others,* which was litigated in parallel and, according to the Claimant, was strictly intertwined with the *Northland Power* case.471 The Claimant also adds that the *Northland Power* case was one of the most prominent cases in Ukraine at that time attracting wide coverage by the local press.472\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 181-182; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 43.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 186; Transcript (27 March 2013), 66:11-14; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b644.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 187; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 45.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 45.\n\n284.\n\nTurning to the Supreme Court proceedings resulting in the de novo review of Cases 28/198 and 28/199, the Claimant contends that these proceedings involved serious due process violations for three reasons. First, the Supreme Court proceedings were held *ex parte* and *in camera.473* According to the Claimant, AmRuz and Seagroup had not been notified of the Prosecutor\u2019s request to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s acceptance of the request on 21 February 2008.474 Hence, the Respondent acted inconsistently with the provisions of the 1965 Hague Convention on Service Abroad.475 Second, even if AmRuz and Seagroup had been notified of the Prosecutor\u2019s request, such notice would not be determinative in the present case since the Supreme Court did not allow AmRuz and Seagroup to submit any objections to the admissibility of the Prosecutor\u2019s request.476 Third, when AmRuz and Seagroup were made aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199, which occurred after its issuance, they had no opportunity to challenge the decision, which was not subject to appeal.477\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 173; Transcript (18 March 2013), 64:21-25.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 61:23-25 to 62:1-15.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 50; Transcript (27 March 2013), 62:15-16; 97:25 to 98:1-3 (the Tribunal notes that this argument was first made by the Claimant during the Hearing on the Merits).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 50; Transcript (27 March 2013), 62:20-25 to 63:1-14.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 50 (internal citations omitted); Transcript (27 March 2013), 63:19-24.\n\n285.\n\nFrom the foregoing, the Claimant concludes that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to grant the Prosecutor\u2019s manifestly time-barred request to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 without providing AmRuz and Seagroup an opportunity to be heard and to challenge the decision resulted in serious breaches of due process and the principle of *res judicata.478*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 51.\n\n286.\n\nThe Claimant adds that the Supreme Court wrongly exercised its discretion to extend the statutory deadline in this case, as it did not meet the requirements that it base its decision on evidence of \"material reasons\" for the missed deadlines; account for the circumstances behind the failure to meet the deadline; and express the \"material reasons\" for a failure to act within the time period in a substantiated opinion.479\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179 (internal citations omitted).\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that, if the unilateral assertion of ignorance (without more) sufficed to reopen final court decisions many years after they had been adjudicated, the *res judicata* effect of court decisions and the finality of judgments would be eviscerated.480\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 180.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the decisions to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 lacked a colorable basis under Ukrainian law.481 Although Article 111 (15)-3 of the Ukrainian Code of Commercial Procedure then in force empowered the Supreme Court of Ukraine to reconsider judgments of the Higher Economic Court if the latter court had applied the same legal provision similarly in different cases,482 Cases 28/198 and 28/199, on the one hand, and *Northland Power,* on the other, could not have been inconsistent, because the latter was a case in which no contribution had been made for the cancelled shares483 and in which the lawfulness of promissory notes as a means of purchasing shares was not considered.484\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 191; Transcript (27 March 2013), 63:23-25 to 64:1-2.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 193; Transcript (18 March 2013), 66:18-25.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 199; Transcript (18 March 2013), 67:14-21.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 200; Transcript (18 March 2013), 67:7-13.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimant notes that, in any event, if the decisions to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 were warranted under Ukrainian law, which it denies, it would mean that Ukrainian law would allow for the reopening of court decisions any time after they had become final on the basis of a mere assertion of inconsistency.485 This again would contravene the principles of legal certainty and *res judicata.486*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 53.\n\n290.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the key requirement under Ukrainian law for reopening proceedings\u2014 the inconsistency of two or several court decisions\u2014was not satisfied in this case. Specifically, (he Claimant states that the courts in Cases 28/198 and 28/199, collectively, and *Northland Power* were not inconsistent in their application of Article 8(3) of the Securities Law and Article 33 of the Company Law because the courts in the former cases did not consider Article 8(3), having found that promissory notes could be used to pay for shares, and merely cited Article 33, as was also the case for the *Northland Power* decision.487 The Claimant further alleges that these decisions are highly questionable, given that the Ukrainian courts had previously stated that the use of promissory notes to pay for shares was permitted under Ukrainian law.488\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 201; Transcript (IS March 2013), 67:4-6.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 290.\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert confirms that, under Article 48(2) of the Ukr ainian SSR Civil Code, the Ukrainian courts were obliged to grant restitution to AmRuz and Seagroup after invalidating their shar e acquisition.489 However, the Kyiv Court of Appeal, while upholding the decision of the Kyiv Economic Court, did not order the return to AmRuz and Seagroup of the promissory notes that they had issued or the amounts that they had paid under the notes.490\n\nToms Second Expert Report, at 69.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 286-287.\n\n292.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert admits that AmRuz and Seagroup were theoretically entitled to file a counterclaim for the return of their property or for a grant of compensation under Ukrainian law.491 However, as a matter of practice, one would never file such a counterclaim since Ukrainian courts would consider it to be a concession.492 In the expert\u2019s opinion, the decision in the *Dekon* case corroborated its position that AmRuz and Seagroup should not have had to file a separate action for the return of their property.493\n\nTranscript(25 March 2013), 90:10-15.\n\nTranscript (25 March 2013), 90:17-25.\n\nTranscript (25 March 2013), 91:2-15.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent first points out that the SPFU prevailed in its claims against AinRuz and Seagroup in six out of the seven courts that reviewed this case on the merits,494 and that the only court that took the position of the Claimant was the Higher Economic Court, which the Respondent contends was mistaken in doing so.495\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 163:23-25 to 164:1-6; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 9.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 89:6-16; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 11.\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the Ukrainian President immediately ordered an investigation when he received a note on 2 July 2001 that advised him that AmRuz and Seagroup had obtained an 18% share of Ukrtatnafta in exchange for mostly promissory notes.496 It also states that Tatneft had initially expressed concerns about the unpaid shares of AmRuz and Seagroup, only to reverse its position later on497 for its own self-interest.498\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 86:2-22; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 7.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 87:6-18.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 87:19-25 to 88:1-22.\n\n295.\n\nAs a general matter, the Respondent notes that \"it is staggering to consider the degree of corruption that would have had to have been perpetrated in this case at all levels of the judiciary, right up to the Ukrainian Supreme Court\" in order to support the Claimant\u2019s primary line of argument that the loss of shares of AinRuz and Seagroup resulted from corrupt legal proceedings.499\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 14.\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Prosecutor had moved to reopen the 2002 decisions of the Higher Economic Court on the shareholdings of AmRUZ and Seagroup once it learned of the later decision of the same court in *Northland Power Daryntsia.500* It rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Prosecutor had acted wrongfully in filing the petition to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199. It states that the application to reopen the cases was based on the Northland Power decision, which rendered any prior knowledge by the Prosecutor\u2019s office of Cases 28/198 and 28/199 immaterial.501 It also points out that the Prosecutor could not have been made aware of the *Northland Power* decision by its participation in the related Case 17/34 because this case predated *Northland Power* by four months502 and characterizes the argument that the Prosecutor would have been monitoring this case for fear of an appeal of Case 17/34 to the Supreme Court as weak.503 The Respondent explains that mere knowledge of *Northland Power Daryntsia* was insufficient to enable the Prosecutor to file an appeal and notes that the Prosecutor had to know, specifically, that this case and Cases 28/198 and 28/199 had relied on Article 33 of the Business Entities Law.504\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 12.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 113; Transcript (27 March 2013), 94:12-19.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 114; Transcript (18 March 2013), 177:7-14.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 94:20-25 to 95:1-7; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 19.\n\n297.\n\nThe Respondent lastly notes that there has been no evidence that the Prosecutor\u2019s application and its acceptance by the Supreme Court was a pretext to benefit the raiders.505 The Respondent also points out that neither AinRuz nor Seagroup contradicted (whether by evidence or pleading) the Prosecutor\u2019s explanation of how he had learned of the *Northland Power* case.506 Moreover, the explanation provided by the Prosecutor to support his application to renew the cassation term was typically accepted by courts in like matters.507 The Respondent further rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument, made during the hearing, that the Prosecutor would have known about the *Northland Power* case merely because this case was famous, and reiterates that the factual record is silent on this matter.508\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 115.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 172:15-19; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 20.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 93:16-21; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 20..\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 95:15-25 to 96:1.\n\n298.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the Supreme Court decision on the cassation renewal as *ex parte* and *in camera.* First, the Respondent states that the decision was not rendered *ex parte* because the Prosecutor notified AinRuz and Seagroup of the cassation appeal, and both AmRuz and Seagroup could have made submissions on this proceeding, but did not.509 In fact, the Respondent points out that there is no evidence that either AmRuz or Seagroup had raised the objection that they had not been notified of the proceeding, and notes that the Claimant itself had not made this argument before the present proceedings.510\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 173:14-24; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 21.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 97:15-20.\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument (which it characterizes as \"belated\") that the Prosecutor\u2019s notice to AinRuz and Seagroup did not comply with the requirements of the 1965 Hague Convention on Service Abroad and argue that there is no evidence showing that AmRuz and Seagroup had alleged a Hague Convention violation when they appeared before the Supreme Court or that this Convention even applies to the matter at hand.511\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 98:4-10; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 22\n\n300.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Supreme Court decision was not made in camera because decisions to grant cassation review are made at a conference of judges, based only on written submissions.512 Moreover, the consistent practice of the Supreme Court was not to provide reasons for its procedural decisions, as a result of which its decisions on the cassation appeal could not be considered \"extraordinary\" or \"unjustified\" just because they were unsubstantiated.513\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 174:7-14.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126; Transcript (18 March 2013), 179:19-25,180:1-18.\n\n301.\n\nMaintaining that the Supreme Court had a material reason to extend the limitation period to enable the Prosecutor to apply for the reopening of Cases 28/198 and 28/199, the Respondent first clarifies that the test at the time of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199 was whether similar laws had been applied differently in the two cases at hand.514 It then rejects the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the *Northland Power* case was not sufficiently similar to Cases 28/198 and 28/199 so as to give rise to any inconsistency.515 It states that at their core. Cases 28/198 and 28/199\u2014as well as *Northland Power* \u2014concerned the failure of the parties to pay for their shares.516 The Respondent specifically alleges that AmRuz and Seagroup not only tendered promissory notes instead of paying for their shares, but further failed to pay the amounts owed under the promissory notes.517 It further states that the ultimate outcome of both Cases 28/198 and 28/199 turned on the same legal provisions that were the subject of the court\u2019s decision in *Northland Power,* namely Article 8(3) of the Securities Law and Article 33 of the Business Associations Law.518 It concludes by stating that \"the decisions of both courts were consistent with the decisions in *Northland Power* and were entirely in accordance with Ukrainian law.\"519\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 121-124.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 182:16-25 to 183:1-4.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 226; Transcript (18 March 2013), 184:8-10.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 226.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 226; Transcript (18 March 2013), 181:2-5,182:4-7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 229.\n\n302.\n\nThe Respondent further points out that neither AmRuz nor Seagroup requested that the Kyiv Court of Appeal order the return of the promissory notes or the amounts paid under them,520 and argues that the Court was therefore under no obligation to award them the said restitution,521 As in the context of its discussion of Cases 32/1 and 17/178 (discussed above), the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s expert\u2019s reliance on the *Dekon* case as controlling authority for the proposition that courts should grant restitution even absent a request from the defendant that it do so, by explaining that *Dekon* contradicted the general trend of court decisions including a 2005 Supreme Court decision;522 that the Claimant\u2019s expert was only made aware of this case by the reference of the Respondent\u2019s expert to it;523 and that the Ukrainian system does not recognize precedent in court cases.524\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 100:14-16.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 186:20-25 to 187:1-8; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 26.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 101:24-25 to 102:1-8,103:14-25.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 103:6-8.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 103:9-13; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 27.\n\n303.\n\nLastly, the Respondent notes that both AmRuz and Seagroup could have filed counterclaims to seek restitution, but both failed to do so.525\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 103:5-10.\n\niii. The Propriety of Procedure in Case 17/60\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the failure of the Economic Court of the Poltava Region to notify the Claimant of Case 17/60 and the dismissal by the Higher Economic Court of the Claimant\u2019s appeal with regard to this issue was wrong and violated the due process rights of the Claimant.526 It contends that this court decision affected the right of the Claimant to participate in the management of Ukrtatnafta, given that the authority to sell Ukrtatnafta\u2019s unpaid shares was vested in the Supervisory Board and was subject to the approval of the General Shareholders Meeting and that the Claimant and the other shareholders had the right to establish the timing and modalities of the sale of the AmRuz and Seagroup shares.527\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 214.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 210-213.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent states that Ukrainian law does not require the Economic Court of the Poltava Region to notify the Claimant of the existence of the proceedings in Case 17/60, as the Economic Procedure Code only required the Court to notify the actual parties, meaning AmRuz and Seagroup, of the existence of the proceedings. While Articles 111-103(3) of the Economic Procedure Code provides that a court decision may be quashed on cassation if it \"concerns\" the rights and obligations of a non-party, the application of this provision is a matter of judicial discretion.528\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 176-182.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s Consideration of the Facts Concerning the Shareholdings of AmRuz and Seagroup**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nIn the view of the Ukrainian Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the two new shareholders were admitted as the need to attract new capital arose in connection with the purchase of oil that could no longer be available as a consequence of the change in the capital contribution of oil wells by Tatarstan.529 Although these other companies are not a party to the dispute before this Tribunal they have the working arrangements with Tatneft that have been described. Whether such arrangements have or have not an influence on the Claimant\u2019s rights is a matter to be considered further below. But what is of importance at this stage of the analysis of the Tribunal is that such other proceedings, namely Cases 28/198 and 28/199, appear to have followed the same pattern considered above.\n\nLetter from Yu Boyko to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, 28 April 2007 (REX-145).\n\n307.\n\nOn the ground that the use of promissory notes that intervened in the capital contributions of AmRuz and Seagroup had violated Article 13 of the Company Law, the lawsuits filed by the SPFU against Ukrtatnafta and all its shareholders seeking invalidation of such contributions were upheld by the Kyiv Economic Court on 28 November 2001. In the Court\u2019s view, that provision excluded promissory notes from the kinds of assets that at the time could be used to contribute to the capital of a company and limited promissory notes to being used for payment for \"delivered products, performed operations or rendered services.\" The outcome of these decisions was that the Court annulled the share purchase agreements entered into with AmRuz and Seagroup, respectively, and ordered that AmRuz and Seagroup return their shares to Ukrtatnafta.\n\n308.\n\nA related issue considered in these cases was whether the extension from 2000 to 2003 of the lime period for the payment of the promissory notes agreed to had breached Articles 11 and 33 of the Company Law and the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement and Charier, with the decisions in question so ruling.\n\n309.\n\nAlthough these decisions were affirmed by the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal on 14 March 2002, they were ultimately reversed by the Higher Economic Court on May 29, 2002 on the ground that Articles 3 and 21 of the Law on Securities and Stock Exchange in conjunction with Article 13 of the Law on Business Companies considered promissory notes a security that can be contributed to the capital of a company. The Supreme Court in a series of decisions adopted in 2002 and 2006 upheld the validity of the use of promissory notes and the extension of the payment period as being compatible with the legislation in effect at the time and Article 5.3 of the Incorporation Agreement. The provisions of the Articles of the Company Law noted were thus held to have been satisfied as in force at the time of the transactions considered in these cases.\n\n310.\n\nAlthough the Respondent believes that the decisions of the Higher Economic Court on the acceptance of the promissory notes issued in payment of the capital contributions of AmRuz and Seagroup, and ultimately their confirmation by the Supreme Court, are legally incorrect,530 the interpretation of Ukrainian law on which they are based is tenable and cannot be disqualified because of being different from the interpretation advanced by other courts that intervened in this matter. That delivery of promissory notes constituted \"payment\" for the purposes of Ukrainian law was a tenable conclusion, just like the extension in the date for payment is. To take into account the law as it stood at the time, in view of amendments barring the use of promissory notes for founders\u2019 capital contributions becoming effective later, is also tenable in spite of the Respondent\u2019s belief to the contrary.531\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 11; Transcript (18 March 2013), 167:7-25 to 168:1-18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 11.\n\n311.\n\nThe fact that there were six out of seven Ukrainian courts at four judicial levels, with 21 out of 24 reviewing judges, that ruled against the use of promissory notes, which the Respondent invokes in support of its argument,532 does not mean that only one interpretation could be regarded as tenable, or that jurisprudence can be established by majority counting. The same holds true for the fact that all decisions that followed the Supreme Court\u2019s reopening of Cases 28/198 and 28/199 were similarly adverse to the companies concerned.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 9.\n\n312.\n\nThe decisions of the Higher Economic Court and the Supreme Court noted stand in contrast to the line of the Tatneft cases considered above and show that, at least with regard to the issue of promissory notes, there were tenable arguments on the side of the affected companies. This development, however, in spite of having provided the basis for a stable legal conclusion on the payment of capital contributions by means of promissory notes, was to be short-lived.\n\n313.\n\nIndeed, in 2002 the Prosecutor had initiated proceedings against AmRuz, Seagroup, Ukrtatnafta and other shareholders that led to Case S/604 before the Poltava Region Economic Court, asserting that Article 5(5) of the Ukrtatnafta Incorporation Agreement authorizing the use of securities, on the basis of which the promissory notes were issued, was contrary to Ukrainian law because the use of promissory notes merely contributed debt obligations and did not comply with the requirement of Article 31 of the Company Law insofar as it could not satisfy the obligation to pay at least 50% of the capital before the first General Shareholders Meeting. The Poltava Region Economic Court dismissed this claim relying on the prior decisions of the Higher Economic Court in Cases 28/198 and 28/199 noted above upholding the lawfulness of promissory notes to effect such capital contributions. Shortly afterwards, in 2004, Naftogaz filed new lawsuits based on the argument that promissory notes were not \"securities\" within the meaning of Article 13 of the Company Law, and also asserting that the extension of the payment date agreed to was contrary to Article 31 of this law. This other claim was also dismissed on appeal by the Kyiv Economic Court and, with the exception of one ground, by the Higher Economic Court,\n\n314.\n\nThe Prosecutor, however, years later, in 2008, filed a Cassation Appeal against the decisions of the Higher Economic Court in respect of Cases 28/198 and 28/199, seeking to reopen such cases in spite of the lapsed appeal time period, on the ground that the Higher Economic Court had applied the same legal provision in a different maimer in Case 45/383, the *Northland Power* case of 2006. The Prosecutor asserted in particular that it had not participated in this case and was therefore unaware of the different interpretations made, a view which the Claimant believes is untrue in light of the various judicial proceedings in which this official had participated and which interlinked the various issues involved, including the *Northland Power* case.533 The Supreme Court then reversed its earlier understanding and ruled that contributing debt obligations was contrary to Article 13 of the Companies Law. It also decided that there were justifiable grounds for commencing cassation proceedings in spite of the missed cassation appeal period, and remanded the cases concerned for de novo review. The judgments of the Higher Economic Court and other courts in these cases were set aside.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 45; First Expert Report of Toms, \u00b6 121: Witness Testimony of Toms, Transcript (25 March 2013), 70:19-25 to 74:1-23,\n\n315.\n\nThe Respondent sees no contradiction in these Supreme Court decisions based on the understanding that at first this Court did not deal with the merits of the case, which only came to be considered at the stage of the cassation appeal, opposing on this point the views of Mr. Toms.534 The scope of the decisions in question might be different but the fact that stands is that the whole issue was reopened and finally led to conclusions exactly contrary to those reached earlier.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, with reference to the Witness Testimony of Tonis.\n\n316.\n\nThe Parties have disputed whether the Cassation Appeal was duly notified to AmRuz and Seagroup, a particularly important due process requirement as the appeal would be decided within one month as mandated by the Ukraine Code of Economic Procedure. In spite of the fact that procedural negligence on the part of these companies is invoked by the Respondent as the basis for having failed to oppose that application before the Supreme Court and resulting in an *ex parte* decision,535 there is no appropriate evidence that such application was properly served and just sending a copy of the cassation appeal is not the same as having duly serviced a proper notice, particularly if in the Claimant\u2019s view the ensuing decision was not later subject to appeal.536 Although the Claimant invoked at the hearing the service requirements of the Hague Convention on Service Abroad this argument was not invoked before the courts nor well explained537 and will thus not be further discussed.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 172:15-25 to 174:1-14; Exhibit C-333; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 21.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 50.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 22.\n\n317.\n\nAs a result of these new developments the share purchase agreements entered into between Ukrtatnafta and AmRuz and Seagroup, respectively, were invalidated in 2008 and AmRuz and Seagroup were ordered to return their shares to Ukrtatnafta. It was held that Article 8(3) of the Securities Law had been breached because shares had been exchanged for sixty-five promissory notes of which only three had been redeemed. Article 33 of the Ukraine Law on Business Associations had also been breached because the shares had not been paid in full at least one year before the registration of the joint stock company. Such exchange was also held incompatible with the 1992 Resolution of the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine on the use of promissory notes allowing their issuance for delivered products, executed works and rendered services. All these decisions were affirmed by the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal, the Higher \u2022 Economic Court and the Supreme Court in the proceedings that followed.\n\n318.\n\nNot long afterwards, also in 2008, Korsan began proceedings in Case 17/60 against Ukrtatnafta and several of its officials seeking to compel the sale of shares formerly held by AmRuz and Seagroup, a request which was granted in 2009 without informing the defendants.\n\n319.\n\nThe Parties have argued about whether the share purchases of AmRuz and Seagroup were contrary to the parity principle of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty, and in particular about whether the parity requirement was permanent or not intended to extend beyond the incorporation of Ukrtatnafta. The Tribunal has already discussed above that the question of the form of capital contributions does not relate to the public nature of the Treaty but rather to the governance of Ukrtatnafta. The situation here is not different. There is no reason to believe that the parity requirement was meant to be permanent as the governance of the company would have been placed in a strait jacket if that were the case. In the Tribunal\u2019s Partial Award on Jurisdiction it was already established that parity had to be understood in a framework of flexibility. Reasons of legal interpretation aside, including the powers given to the company\u2019s governing bodies by the Incorporation Agreement, the situation that followed these developments confirms that parity was not an essential element of the future structure of the company. In fact it will be explained further below that following the invalidation of Tatneft shares and the sale of those held by AinRuz and Seagroup, all shares are today in the hands of Ukrainian interests, public and private. The parity principle simply does not exist today.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced either by the Prosecutor\u2019s assertion that because of being allegedly' unaware of Cases 28/198 and 28/199 and the *Northland Power* decision there was cause to reopen the cases in question. The evidence introduced by the Claimant shows that in fact the Prosecutor had been a party to cases where the same cases and the *Northland Power* decision had been specifically discussed, notably Case 8/604 before the Economic Court of the Poltava Region and Case 17/34 in the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal. The Prosecutor\u2019s statements before the Supreme Court to the effect that he had only learnt of the events concerning Cases 28/198 and 28/199 when Ukrtatnafta had filed its claims before the courts and not earlier is therefore questionable,538 as is the view that such official had not been aware of Case 32/1 as it had been invoked in its own application in Case 8/604.539 Although differences in dates have been noted by the Respondent to argue that *Northland Power* had been issued four months later than the decision in Case 17/34 and hence could not be in the knowledge of the Prosecutor,540 this does not mean that the Prosecutor was unaware of what was being discussed in that other case as the Claimant believes.541\n\nCassation Appeal of the General Prosecutor of January 24, 2008 against the Decree of the Higher Economic Court of May 29.2002, Case 28/198, p. 3 (C-333); Cassation Appeal of the General Prosecutor of January 24.2008 against the Decree of the Higher Economic Court of May 29, 2002, Case 28/199. p. 3 (C-334).\n\nWitness Testimony of Dr. Belyanevich, Transcript (26 March 2013), 8:21-25 to 9:1-4; Judgment of the Poltava Region Economic Court of November 12, 2002, Case 8/604, at 1 and 3, Exhibit C-90; Second Expert Report of Toms, at 31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 20, with reference to the Witness Testimony of Toms.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Article 111(15) of the Ukrainian Code of Economic Procedure provides as a ground for the Supreme Court\u2019s reopening a resolution of the Higher Commercial Court that of when the latter has applied the same provision differently in similar cases. Again here the Parties hold different views. While the Respondent believes that the cases concerning AmRuz and Seagroup dealt with the same issue as *Northland Power,* namely the non-payment of capital contributions in light of Article 8(3) of the Securities Law and Article 33 of the Business Associations Law and thus that the cases were similar and justified their reopening by the Supreme Court, the Claimant is of the view that the cases were not similar as *Northland Power* was a case in which no contribution had been made for the cancelled shares and in which the lawfulness of promissory notes as a means of purchasing shares was not considered.\n\n322.\n\nWhen a court finds in one case that promissory notes could not be used for payment of capital contributions and in another that no capital contributions had been made at all, it is difficult to consider these cases as being similar, particularly in light of the earlier Supreme Court resolution accepting that defendants had discharged their obligations concerning equity contributions by providing the company with the promissory notes in question. If such payment is considered valid it cannot indeed be compared to a situation in which no payment exists. Furthermore, the Tribunal notes the Claimant\u2019s argument to the effect that the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine in an application for review of the decisions in Cases 28/198 and 28/199 recognized as recently as 2010 the validity of AmRuz\u2019s and Seagroup\u2019s share purchases on the ground that they were in accordance with the Ukrainian law in force in 1999.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that at the time of the Supreme Court\u2019s reopening of the cases there was a practice not to give reasons in justification of such outcome,542 and thus that unsubstantiated decisions could not be considered unjustified, is not likely to convince this Tribunal. Neither does the Tribunal find any more convincing the argument that a typical reason for reopening cases is the non-participation of the Prosecutor in the original litigation.543 The Claimant correctly points out that under Ukrainian law, as provided under Articles 71, 76 and 80 of the Civil Code and Articles 111-16 and 53 of tire Code of Economic Procedure, the extension of statutory deadlines requires evidence of \"material reasons\" that would so justify an extension544 a standard that cannot be met by unsubstantiated opinions, particularly when the cases involved entail important economic consequences for the defendants and a serious legal issue concerning the question of *res judicata* of judicial decisions. The Tribunal further notes that the Ukrainian law experts whose reports were produced in the instant case by both Parties are in agreement about such strict requirements for the courts to renew a limitation period, as the Claimant has maintained.545\n\nFirst Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6 24, at 79,\n\nTranscript (26 March 2013), 13:4-25 to 15:1-2.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Toms, at 28-29.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6 20; Expert Report of Martinenko, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n324.\n\nNeither can the Tribunal find convincing the Respondent\u2019s view to the effect that there is a distinction to be made in respect of cases where the Prosecutor acts on behalf of another entity, in which it would be the date the Prosecutor learnt of the relevant violation, and not the date in which the entity so learnt, that would trigger the operation of the Statute of Limitation.546\n\nSecond Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6 41, with reference to the Second Expert Report of Toms, at 13-14.\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal must thus conclude that the extension of a specific statutory deadline does not appear to be justified in this context. Neither is the fact that notifications were omitted in Case 17/60 in respect of Tatneft helpful to support the Respondent\u2019s arguments in respect of compliance with due process of law. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent\u2019s views to the effect that not every allegation of due process violations can result in the breach of the fair and equitable treatment.547 as will be discussed further below, but in this case the questionable role of the Prosecutor that has been noted applies in similar terms to this other series of lawsuits directed to reopening past cases and it thus becomes not an isolated event.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 15:1-12.\n\n**D. THE ALLEGED DEBT FOR PAST OIL DELIVERIES**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Claimant has also brought a claim for the question of alleged debt for past oil purchases. While intertwined with the claims examined above, this claim will be examined by the Tribunal further below.\n\n**V. TATNEFT\u2019S CLAIMS UNDER THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE APPROACHES TO TREATY BREACHES CONTENDED BY THE PARTIES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe first question the Tribunal has to examine in connection with the claims for liability is whether it is appropriate to follow a systemic approach calling for the assessment of the Respondent\u2019s conduct as a whole, which is the position taken by the Claimant, or an approach calling for the examination of the facts individually, which is the position favored by the Respondent.\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimant relies in support of its position on *Rosinvest* (\u00b6 410), *Vivendi II* (\u00b6 7.5.31) and *Walter Bau* (\u00b6 12.43), cases which have underlined the need to consider acts and omissions in a cumulative manner and not as isolated events incapable on their own of establishing liability. In the Claimant\u2019s view, the cumulative acts to be assessed belong to four main categories, all of which have been factually examined above: the seizure of the Kremenchug refinery and the associated change in Ukrtatnafta\u2019s management; the annulment of Tatarstan\u2019s title to shares in the Company (Cases 32/1 and 17/178); the annulment of AmRuz\u2019s and Seagroup\u2019s title to shares (Cases 28/198 and 28/199); and the annulment of Tatneft\u2019s title to shares (Case 17/178).\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that most of the investor\u2019s rights protected under the Russia-Ukraine BIT and its interrelations with other treaties have been breached, with particular reference to the standards for fair and equitable treatment, complete and unconditional legal protection, full protection and security, effective means for assertion of claims and enforcement of rights, and expropriation.548 These claims will be examined below.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.\n\n330.\n\nIn considering the facts of this case the Tribunal has noted that there is a clear link between these series of events and that they all culminated in the taking over of Ukrtatnafta by Ukrainian-related interests to the exclusion of the Tatarstan interests. These developments took place step by step with each aggravating the situation of the Claimant. It would be an artificial proposition to try to assess these events in an isolated manner, particularly in view of the fact that the shareholding in Ukrtatnafta changed dramatically during the intervening period. Indeed, Tatneft\u2019s, AmRuz\u2019s and Seagroup\u2019s interests disappeared altogether with only Naftogaz\u2019s shareholding remaining untouched; the SPFU shares were also diminished and Korean\u2019s interest increased from 1% to 47.08%, a process that appears not to have ended.\n\n331.\n\nAs a point of fact, during his testimony at the oral hearing Mr. Kolomoisky explained that the original plans to create a vertically integrated company had not succeeded thus far because they needed the concurrence of Naftogaz as Ukraine\u2019s most important shareholder, but efforts at trying to harmonize operations in the sectors in which the group operates are going on549 and that in any event the initial share purchase was conceived as an entry ticket to the prospect of further acquisitions.550 It is also of interest to note that of the US$ 720 million paid at this stage by Korsan for the shares in Ukrtatnafta, only US$ 200 million related to the assets bought and the balance was related to building up the company\u2019s working capital and other needs.551\n\nTranscript (25 March 2013), 121:22-25 to 122:1-9,130:6-14.\n\nTranscript (25 March 2013), 137:9-17,138:3-14.\n\nWitness Testimony of Kolomoisky, Transcript (25 March 2013), 125:25 to 129:1-20.\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful that cumulative and composite acts and omissions are a well established principle governing liability under international law as evidenced by Article 15 of the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility. The Claimant\u2019s arguments to this effect are well supported by the jurisprudence of tribunals and writers.552\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 1.\n\n**B. THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE \"COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL LEGAL PROTECTION\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT requires the Respondent to provide \"complete and unconditional legal protection\" to qualifying investments, as follows:\n\nEach of the Contracting Parties guarantees in accordance with its legislation the complete and unconditional legal protection of investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Interpretation of Article (2) of the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThe Claimant interprets Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\").553 Relying on what it takes to be the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 2(2), the Claimant interprets the provision as requiring the Respondent to ensure that Russian investments enjoy the protection of Ukrainian law and to refrain from conduct that would deprive the said investments of this protection.554 It thereby characterizes Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT as \"an assurance to the investor that the [host State\u2019s] laws will be applied.555 which means that the \"failure to comply with the national law to which a treaty refers will have an international effect.\"556 As an example of such an \"international effect\" of domestic law breaches, the Claimant refers to *Bogdanov v. Moldova,* where the tribunal found that Moldova\u2019s violations of its own law breached Article 2(2) of the Russia-Moldova BIT. The Russia-Moldova BIT requires Moldova to guarantee \"under its legislation a complete and unconditional legal protection of the capital investments\" of Russian investors.557\n\nPursuant to Article 31(1), an international treaty must \"be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose \" Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of May 23, 1969.1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (CLA-16).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 328; Transcript (18 March 2013), 73:18-25.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 331, *citing MTD Equity Sdn.

Republic of the Philippines.*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 332.\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the immediate context of paragraph 2 of Article 2 within the Russia-Ukraine BIT confirms its interpretation of the provision; it observes that paragraph 1 of Article 2 requires the Contracting Parties to \"encourage investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory.\" The Claimant further considers its interpretation of Article 2(2) confirmed by the object and purpose of the Russia-Ukraine BIT\u2014as stated in its Preamble\u2014\"to create and maintain favorable conditions for mutual investments,\" of which the application of the law is a crucial element.558\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 333; Transcript (18 March 2013), 74:15-20.\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimant draws further support from Article 7 of the Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Investment Activity dated 24 December 1993 (\"1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement\"), which was open to signature by all member-States of the Commonwealth of Independent States.559 The Claimant alleges that the 1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement requires the contracting parties to provide compensation for State actions that are inconsistent with legislation, and that that Agreement formed the basis of Article 2(2). As the Claimant points out, the Preamble of the Russia-Ukraine BIT acknowledges that the BIT is \"seeking to develop the main provisions of the [1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement].\"560\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 350.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 334; Second Memorial, \u00b6 350; Transcript (18 March 2013), 74:25 to 75:1-3.\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 2(2), which it characterizes as requiring a \"heightened showing such as miscarriage of justice.\"561 It differentiates the investment treaty awards cited by the Respondent to support its position by pointing to the phrase \"in accordance with its legislation\" in Article 2(2).562 The Claimant contends that this phrase has the effect of setting compliance with Ukrainian law as the applicable standard for state conduct, to the exclusion of the customary international law minimum standard or an autonomous treaty standard, thereby equating the violation of a State of its domestic law with a treaty violation or a breach of an international obligation.563 It also argues that the substance of these awards do not in fact support the position of the Respondent.564\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 347.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 348.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 349, citing to International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, in Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, UN Doc.

The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent\u2019s Interpretation of Article 2(2) of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nWhile the Respondent accepts the Claimant\u2019s view that Article 2(2) \"entitle[s] Russian investments to the protection of Ukrainian law and impose[s] on Ukraine a corollary obligation to ensure the enjoyment of such protection and refrain from conduct that deprives Russian investments of the legal protection of Ukrainian law,\"569 the Respondent stresses that a breach of Article 2(2) can only occur if there has in fact been a violation of Ukrainian law. As noted above, the Respondent denies that the authorities or courts of Ukraine acted contrary to Ukrainian law.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 141.\n\n341.\n\nTurning to the specific issue of the application of the standard of \"complete and unconditional legal protection\" to judicial decisions, the Respondent explains that arbitral review of conduct of the judiciary is relatively rare. Where tribunals were called upon to review judicial decisions, they had concluded that state courts provide appropriate legal protection when the court is available to the investors for the assertion of their rights570 and when the court\u2019s rulings on those rights are legally tenable and made in good faith.571\n\nCounter-Menrorial, \u00b6\u00b6 144-146, citing *Ronald Lauder* v. *the Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001, \u00b6 314 (emphasis added by Respondent), RLA-52 (where the tribunal stated that \"[t]he Respondent\u2019s *only* duty under the Treaty [which contained a \"full protection and security\" clause] was to keep its *judicial system available* for the Claimant and any entities he controls to bring their claims\" and found that the initiation of Czech court proceedings protecting the claimant\u2019s interest evinced the full availability of the Czech judicial system to the claimant) and *Parkerings-Compagniet AS* v. *Republic of Lithuania,* lCSID Case ARB/05/8 Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 360-361, CLA-172, where the tribunal stated that \"[t]he Respondent\u2019s duty' under the Treaty' was, first to keep its judicial system available for the Claimant to bring its contractual claims\" and concluded that the claimant had failed to show that it was prevented from seeking reparation from the Lithuanian courts for the alleged violation of its rights.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 147-151, *citing* *Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul* v, *Tajikistan* S.C.C.

It rejects the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the events of 19 October 2007 as a raid, and frames them instead as the proper implementation of valid court decisions ordering the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko.576 In particular, it alleges that neither the 26 September 2007 court decisions reinstating Mr. Ovcharenko577 nor the 19 October 2007 enforcement of these decisions were illegal.578 The Respondent also argues that, in any event, Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement could not have been the cause of the Claimant\u2019s alleged losses.579\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 153.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 154-165.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 166-181.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 182-189; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 140-146.\n\n346.\n\nTurning then to the decisions of the Ukrainian courts complained of by the Claimant, tire Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to show either that the Ukrainian judiciary was not available to it or that the court proceedings were not \"reasonably tenable\" or not conducted in good faith.580\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 10:8-13.\n\n347.\n\nThe Respondent points out that there is no basis for the allegation that the Prosecutor lied or was otherwise improperly motivated in its motion to reopen the prescription period for Case 32/1 or in its motion to renew the cassation term in Cases 28/198 and 28/199.581 It further argues that the Claimant has not shown that the courts that found a valid reason to reopen these cases were acting improperly.582\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 10:14-23.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 10:23-25.\n\n348.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the court decisions invalidating the Claimant\u2019s direct shareholding in Ukrtatnafta did not breach Article 2(2) because the Economic Court of the Poltava Region, in Case 17/8, reasonably found that it had jurisdiction,583 that the claims brought to it were not time-barred,584 and that tire Claimant\u2019s purchase of shares was invalid.585\u2019 The Economic Court also reasonably applied Article 83(2) of the Securities Law.586 The Respondent further argues that the higher courts reasonably upheld the lower court\u2019s decision in \u2022 this matter.587\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 197-203, Transcript (19 March 2013), 11:1-14.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 204-209.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 210-212.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 213-216.\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that the court decisions invalidating the Ukrtatnafta shares of AmRuz and Seagroup did not breach Article 2(2) because they conformed to Ukrainian law. Even if one were to question the conformity of these decisions to Ukrainian law, the Claimant has not shown, in the Respondent\u2019s view, that these decisions were not \"reasonably tenable\" or not rendered in good faith.588 Specifically, the Respondent argues that tire Supreme Court of Ukraine reasonably remanded Cases 28/198 and 28/199,589 and that the Kyiv Economic Court and the Kyiv Economic Court of Appeal reasonably found that the contributions of AmRuz and Seagroup to the authorized capital of Ukrtatnafta violated Ukrainian law.590 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Kyiv Court of Appeal reasonably applied Article 83(2) of the Securities Law,591 and the Higher Economic Court of Ukraine and the Supreme Court of Ukraine reasonably upheld the findings of the lower court.592\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 217-241.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 220-228.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 229-235.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 236-238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 239-241.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nThe conditions under which judicial misconduct triggers a State\u2019s international responsibility have been the subject of controversy in both arbitral jurisprudence and scholarly discussions. This controversy extends to the related question of how deferential international courts or tribunals should be in reviewing the alleged misconduct of domestic courts. These difficulties are compounded in the present case as it is not only the conduct of courts that it is at issue but also the participation of the State in many of the facts discussed, either by means of the intervention of various ministries and State agencies or in particular that of the Public Prosecutor, an official who in spite of normally having autonomous functions is nonetheless a State agent. A further difficulty from the point of view of international law is that the judiciary is as part of the State as any State body and its independence does not exclude it from engaging the responsibility of the State as a matter of principle. Deferential treatment of the role of courts by international tribunals is necessary, above all when their independence is fully established, but this does not extend to excuse acts or omissions' that might be in breach of treaty\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal must first note in this respect that the traditional customary law responsibility arising as a consequence of denial of justice by the State courts is not present in this case, in any event as far as procedural aspects are considered. The courts have been generally available to the affected parties, although there have been questions concerning *ex parte* decisions or proceedings that, while not necessarily constituting denial of justice might be in breach of other standards of protection. The delay in deciding cases submitted to the courts is not extraordinary as compared to that which occurs in many judicial systems. Evidence concerning nationality-based discrimination is not readily available although there has been in this case a clear intent to substitute Ukrainian interests for those of Tatarstan and the companies related to the latter\u2019s interests; it is not possible, however, to establish that this was the consequence of discrimination in terms of nationality, but might also have an incidence in respect of the breach of other standards of protection. The same holds true in respect of allegations of corruption which have not specifically identified any such instance and are based on a general perception affecting the Ukrainian judiciary.\n\n352.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that there is broad agreement in considering that mere errors of fact or law on the part of the domestic courts do not breach the standard of denial of justice. There is, however, no consensus on whether a \"substantive denial of justice\" exists, as opposed to a procedurally based one, and, if the answer is in the affirmative, what its threshold should be. It should be noted that in respect of the fair and equitable treatment standard the observance of both substantive and procedural due process has been occasionally required, as reflected in *SIAG and Vecchi* v. *Egypt**, Mondev* and *Amto**.*\n\n353.\n\nThe early efforts at codification of the law of State responsibility did not ignore this question and in fact placed considerable emphasis on the view that a manifestly unjust judgment could well result in engaging the liability of the wrongdoer State, a proposition that at the time was on many occasions, but not always, considered in the context of denial of justice. On occasions, too, this was to be coupled with a discriminatory intent towards the protected alien.\n\n354.\n\nResponsibility in light of questions concerning the interpretation and application of the law find, in addition to those standards that might be found applicable under customary law, a direct link with the standard of \"complete and unconditional legal protection\" and the \"effective means\" standard found in some BITs. This is the case of Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT relevant in this dispute, as used in the Energy Charter Treaty and brought into the BIT by operation of the Most Favoured Nation Clause, to which the Tribunal turns now.\n\n355.\n\nThe key phrase \"complete and unconditional legal protection\" is not further defined in Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. It thus falls to the Tribunal to determine the content of the Respondent\u2019s obligation under Article 2(2) in light of the rules governing the interpretation of treaties and, to the extent necessary, under customary international law.\n\n356.\n\nCase law is not abundant on this point as not many BITs have included this particular kind of protection. The Parties have discussed in support of their respective positions the decision in *Yury Bogdanov* v. *Republic of Moldova**,* the Claimant arguing that it shows the engagement of liability in view of the Respondent\u2019s non-compliance with domestic law and the Respondent maintaining that such a case did not concern any action by the courts. The implications of such a decision for a case in which court action is at the heart of the dispute are not clear' and thus cannot be relied upon by this Tribunal. However, the finding that an investor can rely on the assurance that the laws will be applied has not escaped the attention of tribunals, as evidenced in *MTD**.*\n\n357.\n\nThe Parties have also discussed in this context Article 7 of the 1993 Investment Cooperation Agreement, providing for compensation if actions of State bodies or officials inconsistent with the legislation of the State that is host to the investment result in damages to the investor. While this Agreement has a nexus to the BIT in light of the latter\u2019s Preamble, it is not specific enough to help in the interpretation of such BIT, in addition to the fact that the Agreement was never ratified by Russia and even temporary application was terminated.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful that this discussion is linked to the requirement of ensuring that the protected person will have effective means available for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights as emphasized in *Parkerings* v. *Lithuania**.* This is the case of the instant dispute, as Article 10(12) of the Energy Charter Treaty - as incorporated in the Russia-Ukraine BIT through the most-favoured nation clause found in Article 3(1) - explicitly contains this requirement in respect of the protection of the investment.\n\n359.\n\nThe Parties have discussed the case *Anito* v. *Ukraine* in connection to this particular requirement, which although it dealt with the question of having legislation for the protection of property and contractual rights available, was not concerned with the kind of judicial conduct here complained of. This particular decision is thus of little help in providing guidance in the interpretation of this standard. Of greater relevance are the cases of *Chevron* v. *Ecuador* and *White Industries* v. *India.* The tribunal in the former understood a similar provision of the applicable BIT as closely related to the customary law standard of denial of justice, but noted that under the BIT the test might be less demanding that under the denial of justice. The latter case was more explicit in identifying the contents of the effective means standard, mainly in conjunction with issues of delay in court proceedings that were of relevance in that case.\n\n360.\n\nThis Tribunal must note that both decisions corroborate to an extent the proposition that the customary law denial of justice test has not remained unchanged since first formulated and that the current understanding that customary law has evolved so as to become more closely identified with the applicable treaty standards is the prevalent approach. The Respondent, however, views such decisions as inapposite to this case as they dealt with long delays in the court system of 13 and 9 years respectively.\n\n361.\n\nIn light of the facts of this case, the Tribunal has concluded above that there are no grounds for a finding of denial of justice. The observance of the BIT standards discussed in this connection is open to greater doubt as there are elements of the factual record that could lead in the direction of a breach as far as the compliance with domestic law is concerned, but not so in respect of the effective means standard as the court system has been generally available, with some limited exceptions. These questions, however, are inseparable from the discussion and findings concerning other BIT standards, in particular the fair and equitable treatment, within which such questions are subsumed. While the individuality of Article 2(2) might be justified in the context of certain disputes, in the instant case all of its relevant elements are indistinguishable from the BIT\u2019S principal standards.\n\n**C. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT, FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY AND \"EFFECTIVE MEANS\": THE OBLIGATION UNDER ARTICLE 3(1) OF THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE BIT IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OF ARTICLE 2(2) OF THE UK-UKRAINE BIT AND ARTICLE 10(12) OF THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides:\n\nEach of the Contracting Parties shall provide in its territory, for investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, and for activities in connection with such investments, treatment [or a regime] no less favourable than the treatment [or the regime] provided for its own investors or for investors of any third state, excluding the application of measures of a discriminatory nature which could obstruct the management and the disposal of investments.\n\n363.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ukraine for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 10 February 1993 (\"UK-Ukraine BIT\")593 obliges the Respondent to accord investments of investors of the other Contracting Party the following treatment:\n\nInvestments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full, protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\ni. The Claimant\u2019s Interpretation of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimant states that the application of the fair and equitable treatment standard, which is not further de fined in the UK-Ukraine BIT, depends on the facts of each case. However, fair and equitable treatment clearly encompasses fundamental legal standards.597 The Claimant specifies that the following form part of the fair and equitable treatment obligation: the prohibition against unreasonable or arbitrary conduct.598 the obligation to accord substantive and procedural due process;599 the obligation not to deny justice;600 the obligation to ensure a stable and predictable legal framework in conformity with general principles of legal certainty, the statute of limitations and *res judicata;601* the protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations with respect to the host State\u2019s law and its application, which includes transparency and the observation of such well-established fundamental standards as good faith;602 and the prohibition against discrimination, which is also included as a stand-alone protection in Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT and Article 2(2) of the UK-Ukraine BIT.603\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 365; Transcript (18 March 2013), 48:5-11.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 367-375; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 393; Transcript (18 March 2013), 48:12-15; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 399-401; Transcript (18 March 2013), 48:15-17; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 413-419 Transcript (18 March 2013), 48:23-25.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 425-428.\n\n367.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, a state\u2019s international responsibility is not exhausted by the concept of denial of justice. While court decisions that misapply domestic law but otherwise conform to the international obligation of a state trigger state responsibility only in the event that denial of justice is shown,604 court decisions that conflict with a state\u2019s treaty-based international obligations constitute an internationally wrongful act regardless of whether the court\u2019s conduct qualifies as a denial of justice.605\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 250-252.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 248-249,251-252.\n\n368.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the fair and equitable treatment standard is independent and more protective of foreign investments than the denial of justice standard under customary international law. In support of its position, it cites *EDF (Services) v. Romania* and *Lemire v.* *Ukraine,* stating that these decisions do not distinguish between judicial and other state conduct in reviewing judicial conduct for arbitrariness. Thus, the application of the fair and equitable treatment standard to judicial conduct is not limited to protection from denial ofjustice.606\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 261-263, citing *EDF (Services)* v. *Romania* and *Lemire* v. *Ukraine.*\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the awards cited by the Respondent are inapposite. As the Claimant explains, *Mondev* v. *United States* involved the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1105(1), which specifically equates fair and equitable treatment to the international minimum standard (that is, the standard of customary international law). Moreover, the *Mondev* Award does not differentiate judicial from administrative conduct or limit the fair and equitable treatment standard to protection from denial of justice.607*RoslnvestCo* v. *Russian Federation* involved an expropriation claim, and the tribunal did not apply its holding that court decisions must be reviewed for a denial of justice, as it chose to examine the respondent\u2019s conduct as a whole.608 Finally, *Azinian* v. *Mexico* was adjudicated under NAFTA609 and did not involve the conduct of the Mexican courts.610\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 264.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 258.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 259.\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the jurisprudence on Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights (\"ECHR\"), on which the Respondent relies, is also unavailing because investment treaties accord investors better protection than the ECHR, with Article 6 providing for procedural protections alone.611\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 267.\n\n371.\n\nThe Claimant thereby posits that the standard for analyzing court decisions is the \"reasonably tenable\" standard.612\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 274.\n\nii. Application of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard to the Facts\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in the following ways. First, it claims that the Respondent subjected the investments of the Claimant to arbitrary and unreasonable measures, including the deprivation of control, management, and ownership of Ukrtatnafta. In particular, the Claimant regards as unfair and unreasonable the 26 September 2007 court decisions that led to the events of 19 October 2007 and the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko613 and the subsequent court decisions that deprived the Claimant of its direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta.614\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379; Transcript (IS March 2013), 50:1-25 to 51:1-6; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 3 SO-392.\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimant characterizes these court decisions as evidence of the Respondent\u2019s active support of and complicity with Private Group, which, in the Claimant\u2019s view, is one of the most vigorous raiders in Ukraine and which had masterminded the raid against Ukrtatnafta.615\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n374.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that the conduct of the Respondent violated basic requirements of procedural propriety and due process. In particular, the Claimant refers to the Ukrainian court\u2019s acceptance of the Prosecutor\u2019s and Ukrtatnafta\u2019s claims in Cases 32/1 and 17/178, although these claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations.616 It is the Claimant\u2019s position that the Prosecutor\u2019s conduct in these cases was abusive and \"represents a clear example of the misuse of the broad powers that the Prosecutor enjoys in Ukraine.\"617 The Claimant asserts that conduct of such type led the Venice Commission to conclude that the Ukrainian Prosecutor\u2019s powers considerably exceed the scope of functions performed by a prosecutor in a democratic state, prompting the Council of Europe to require Ukraine to commit to adapt the role of the Prosecutor\u2019s office to European standards, which Ukraine has not done.618\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 395; Transcript (27 March 2013), 57:1-3, 70:15-23; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b634, 60.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to the reopening of Cases 28/198 and 28/199 after they had become final.619 It argues that the general principle of legal certainty is violated when a Prosecutor \"is permitted to use remote or, as here, fabricated inconsistencies in case law to set aside the *res judicata effect* of a final judgment.\"620\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 396; Transcript (27 March 2013), 63:23-24; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 46.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 46.\n\n376.\n\nAs a further point relating to the violation of the due process requirement, the Claimant alleges that it was denied the right to participate in Case 17/60, where tire Ukrainian courts ordered tire AmRuz and Seagroup shares to be sold at auction, and that the Claimant was denied appeal on the merits on allegedly preposterous procedural grounds.621\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 397.\n\n377.\n\nThird, the Claimant contends that the court decisions relating to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko as Chairman of the Management Board and the invalidation of the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta evidence the pivotal role of the Ukrainian courts in the \"black\" raider attack in this case. These court decisions, in the Claimant\u2019s view, amounted to a denial of justice because they were clearly improper and discreditable.622\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 399-412.\n\n378.\n\nFourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent frustrated the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations by failing to ensure a predictable, consistent, and stable legal framework for the Claimant\u2019s investments. It states that the Respondent frustrated the Claimant\u2019s expectation that its status as an Ukrtatnafta shareholder would be respected and that the purchase by AmRuz and Seagroup of their Ukrtatnafta shares would not be reexamined after the Ukrainian courts had repeatedly upheld them. The Claimant holds that Ukraine violated its Treaty obligation to provide effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights by enabling a regime that eventually rendered the statute of limitations a dead letter. It contends that the Ukrainian regime allowed the Prosecutor to challenge foreign investments regardless of the length of time that the State was aware of the purported violations.623 In the Claimant\u2019s view, a prescription period may only be renewed in exceptional circumstances in order to comply with the principle of legal certainty. The fact that a Prosecutor merely claims to not have had earlier knowledge of certain facts does not qualify as material reason for such a renewal.624\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 35.\n\n379.\n\nTire Claimant argues further that the Respondent frustrated the Tatarstan shareholders\u2019 expectation that the Ukrainian courts would respect the unanimous decision of the Ukrtatnafta General Shareholders Meeting to reinstate and then remove Mr. Ovcharenko and reinstate Mr. Glushko as the Chairman of the Management Board.625\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6413-424; Transcript (18 March 2013), 48:2-5.\n\n380.\n\nFifth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent discriminated against the investments of the Claimant by its differential treatment of the Claimant\u2019s, Naftogaz\u2019s and Korsan\u2019s investments in Ukrtatnafta, in that the Prosecutor took no action against Korsan for the violation of tire alleged parity requirement\u2014when its increased shareholding in Ukrtatnafta, coupled with the 43,054% stake of Naftogaz, gave the Ukrainian shareholders a 99,895% stake in Ukrtatnafta\u2014whereas the Prosecutor had brought proceedings against the Tatarstan shareholders for their violation of the supposed parity requirement.626\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 425-431.\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\ni. The Respondent\u2019s Interpretation of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent points out that neither the UK-Ukraine BIT nor international law precisely defines the notion of fair and equitable treatment.627 The Respondent contends that this standard protects against a denial of justice when applied to court decisions.628 Accordingly, it is mainly concerned with judicial processes and procedures, with the substance of these decisions being relevant only to the extent that they shed light on the adequacy of judicial process.629 The denial of justice standard is not breached by the mere misapplication of domestic law, the Respondent contends, but only by \"fundamental unfairness as understood by reference to international norms,\"630 which translates to \"a grave and manifest injustice\" or bad faith.631\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 243.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 244; Transcript (19 March 2013), 13:7-14.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 244.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 167.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 175.\n\n382.\n\nWhile the Respondent clarifies that it is not equating the fair and equitable treatment standard to the minimum standard of treatment applicable under customary international law, it argues that modern tribunals\u2014such as in *Swiss lion* v. *Macedonia632\u2014* have confined their analysis of fair and equitable treatment to whether there was a denial of justice in a particular case.633 It argues that *Vivendi* v. *Argentina* and *Azurix* v. *Argentina* do not support the Claimant\u2019s position that the fair and equitable treatment standard allows the review of court decisions for more than a denial of justice, as court decisions were not at issue in these cases.634 Instead, the Respondent suggests the applicability of *Azinian* v. *Mexico* where Mexican court decisions were reviewed under the denial of justice test.635\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 143-144.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142; Transcript (19 March 2013), 15:13-17.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 145.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 146.\n\n383.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that the Tribunal should focus on applying the denial of justice test to the discrete judicial decisions, and criticizes the references of the Claimant to raider actions as unhelpful and used only to elicit sympathy for the Claimant\u2019s case.636\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 147.\n\n384.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s reliance on the award in *Frontier Petroleum* v. *Czech Republic* for the proposition that the proper test under the fair and equitable treatment standard is whether court decisions contain a \"plausible interpretation\" of the relevant law or were \"reasonably tenable,\" the Respondent clarifies that, even in *Frontier Petroleum,* the denial of justice was equated with procedural propriety and due process.637 Even so, the Respondent points out that a breach of due process does not automatically equate to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard,638 unless such breach is fundamental.639\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 156-157.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 15:1-3.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 15:10-12.\n\nii. Application of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard to the Facts\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it has not breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in this case. First, it argues that the standard of fair and equitable treatment was not breached by the 26 September 2007 court decisions that led to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko because the Claimant has not provided any evidence that these decisions resulted in any grave and manifest injustice.640 Nor did the decisions in Case 17/178, which led to the invalidation of the Claimant\u2019s direct shareholding in Ukrtatnafta, or Cases 28/198 and 28/199, which led to the invalidation of the Ukrtatnafta shares of both AmRuz and Seagroup, and Case 17/60, which ordered the auction of these invalidated shares, entail a breach of fair and equitable treatment, because the Claimant has not shown that these decisions were \"manifestly unfair and unreasonable.\"641\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 253-257.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 258-282.\n\n386.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the invalidation of the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta did not violate the basic requirements of procedural propriety and due process. It first states that the awards cited by the Claimant to support its position were based on \"the egregiousness of the acts constituting denial of due process,\" which cannot be shown for the Ukrainian courts cases with which the Claimant has taken issue.642 In the present case, the Respondent states that the Claimant has not proven that the Prosecutor or the Ukrainian courts biased against it or otherwise corrupt;643 and any allegation of impropriety on the part of Ukrtatnafta would not alter this conclusion, as no liability can be imposed on a host State for the actions of private parties that were not acting under the State\u2019s control or direction.644 Pointing out that the substance of the decisions about which the Claimant complains conform to both Ukrainian law and judicial practice,645\u2019 the Respondent states that the Claimant has not proven that the conduct of the relevant courts constituted \"a demonstrated miscarriage of justice\" or \"a manifest failure of natural justice injudicial proceedings,\"646 and in fact cannot do so, given that the complex issues of both Ukrainian substantive and procedural law were fully litigated before the courts.647 Lastly, the Respondent points out that the damage that the Claimant has identified as caused by the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to uphold procedural regularity or due process\u2014 namely, the deprivation of the \"control, management and ownership of Ukrtatnafta\"\u2014is implausible as such control, management and ownership was never the Claimant\u2019s to begin with, given its minority shareholding.648\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 291.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 293.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 294.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 295.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 296.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 296.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 296.\n\n387.\n\nApart from arguing that the merits of the above-cited cases do not violate the denial of justice standard, the Respondent also points out that the merits of the said cases do not violate the \"reasonably tenable\" test, which the Claimant argues should apply.649 The Respondent moreover argues that the decisions renewing the cassation appeal term or reopening the prescription term did not violate this standard, as they were in line with both Ukrainian procedural law and court practice.650\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 16:9-25 to 17:1-17.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 15:21-25 (o 16:1-4.\n\n388.\n\nThird, the Respondent contends that its response to the Claimant\u2019s version of the judicial decisions that facilitated the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and invalidated the direct and indirect shareholdings of the Claimant in Ukrtatnafta show that these decisions do not constitute a denial ofjustice.651 It also notes that the Claimant has not provided any evidence in support of its \"sweeping accusations\" that Ukrainian courts play a pivotal role in the completion of corporate raider attacks.652\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 299.\n\nCounter-Memorial. \u00b6\u00b6 300-301.\n\n389.\n\nFourth, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s invocation of the \"predictable, consistent and stable legal framework\" standard for judicial decisions is misplaced, because this standard applies solely to administrative acts, with the standard for assessing judicial treatment being that of a denial of justice or a \"pretence of form to achieve an internationally unlawful end.\"653\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 302-310.\n\n390.\n\nFifth, the Respondent contends that it did not discriminate against the Claimant\u2019s investments because the Claimant was not singled out as a defendant in Case 32/1, which was brought against all Ukrtatnafta shareholders. Case 32/1 sought the liquidation of Ukrtatnafta, which is inconsistent with the motive that the Claimant would ascribe to the proceedings, namely to take the investment of the Tatarstan shareholders and give it to Korsan. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant cannot and should not be allowed to impose on the Respondent the burden of disproving unfounded allegations of discrimination.654\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 3 31 -316.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings in Respect of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal has explained above that denial of justice, at least from a procedural point of view and the availability of access to the courts, is not a finding that could be supported by the facts of this case in spite of the fact that the judicial process has evidenced shortcomings, some serious. It has also noted the agreement in considering that mere errors of fact or law on the part of the domestic courts do not breach the standard of denial of justice. This finding, however, does not dispose of the question concerning the eventual existence of a \"substantive denial of justice\".\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful of the discussion about whether denial of justice is an expression of the customary law \"international minimum standard\" and how this customary standard relates to present day treaty standards of protection. What is certain Is that the \"international minimum standard\" has not been frozen at the time when it was first formulated in the *Neer* case in the 1920s. In spite of the fact that findings of \"egregious\" conduct and similar high standards of review have been often associated with the operation of the international minimum standard and denial of justice thereunder, it is today accepted that customary law has evolved with time in this respect and that its own standard of protection is not necessarily different from the widespread treaty protection available at present.\n\n393.\n\nThe Parties to this case, while not disagreeing on the fact that the FET standard is applicable in light of treaty protection, maintain different views about the meaning of this standard as far as judicial review is concerned. The Claimant asserts that the FET standard constitutes an autonomous treaty standard which offers protection beyond customary international law. The Respondent states that it is not requesting the Tribunal to apply the international minimum standard of customary international law, but argues that the FET standard prescribes no more than a prohibition of denial of justice when applied to judicial decisions.\n\n394.\n\nIn examining the content of this standard under investment protection treaties and their interpretation by numerous tribunals it is not difficult to ascertain that it encompasses today at least: (a) protection against arbitrary and unreasonable measures, discrimination, and denial of justice, (b) the right to procedural propriety and due process, and (c) the assurance of a predictable, consistent and stable legal framework.\n\n395.\n\nAlthough some manifestations of this standard might not be specific to an examination of judicial conduct they are nonetheless indicative of the intention to ensure that the legal process governing the protected rights as a whole, including its judicial manifestations, is fair and reasonable, devoid of arbitrariness, discrimination or manipulation to the detriment of those rights. The concepts of fairness and equitableness are the reflection of this intended requirement and show that in reality there is no reason to consider that the situation would need to be different under customary law as presently understood. This also explains why it is most difficult to separate the treaty standards of full protection and security and complete and unconditional legal protection from the FET standard as they all point in the same direction.\n\n396.\n\nIn assessing the facts of this case the Tribunal has concluded that the events of 19 October 2007 at the Kremenchug refinery were not as peaceful as maintained by the Respondent and certainly went beyond any normal enforcement of court decisions, particularly from the point of view of the use of force and physical occupation, including the subsequent participation of the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s troops to secure the occupation of the plant.\n\n397.\n\nThese facts in themselves raise important questions about whether the FET standard was adequately observed. This determination is, however, inseparable from the discussion of the judicial decisions that intervened in connection with the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko. The Tribunal has considered above the issues arising from the decision of the Aftozavodsky District Court of 9 November 2004 ordering the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, as well as those concerning the *ex parte* supplementary judgment and the *ex parte* interim measures issued by the Kriukivskiy District Court on 26 September 2007. It is necessary to keep in mind in this respect that in *Deutsche Bank* the tribunal, as noted by the Claimant, specifically found a breach of FET in respect of an *ex parte* court order based on limited evidence and where the affected party was not given the opportunity to respond as due process had not been observed. The testimony of Mr. Pryschepa at the hearing also confirms that the resolution on interim measures did not stipulate the voluntary period for compliance associated with enforcement proceedings.655\n\nWitness Testimony of Pryschepa, Transcript (21 March 2013), 93:1-9.\n\n398.\n\nAs a result of these various proceedings the powers of the company\u2019s governing bodies to have dismissed, reinstated and dismissed Mr. Ovcharenko again, were obliterated to the benefit of those interests competing for the control of Ukrtatnafta on the basis of an interpretation of the Ukrainian Labor Code that stands in contrast with the provisions of more pertinent legislation, such as the Civil Code and the Company Law\n\n399.\n\nSuch approach could well fall within the ambit of judicial error and hence not compromise the court\u2019s and the State\u2019s responsibility for breach of the internationally guaranteed forms of protection relevant in this case. The problem was, however, compounded by procedural defects that also tend to cast doubt on the observance of the due process requirements of the applicable standards, particularly in connection with the unclear way in which the four resolutions initiating enforcement proceedings were allegedly served on Ukrtatnafta, until then still under the effective control of Tatneft and related interests. The view of one witness to the effect that no service is required under Ukrainian law in respect of requests for the reopening of cases656 is untenable as a matter of due process.\n\nWitness Testimony of Belyanevich, Transcript (26 March 2013), 5:6-15.\n\n400.\n\nThe 2007 decisions were also directly geared toward facilitating the powers of the incoming management as far as the organizational, operational, economic, financial and other activities of the company were concerned. As noted above, the complete takeover of the company\u2019s management was thus achieved and the complete reorganization of the company to reflect this fact immediately followed. Nor were the criminal investigations of the events at the refinery carried out. Whether such developments were the outcome of a black raider\u2019s action or not is irrelevant to the conclusion that the trend thus far was with each step leading farther away from the faithful observance of the FET standard.\n\n401.\n\nHad that been the end of the matter the Tribunal might have had difficulty in reaching a wholly satisfactory determination regarding the observance of FET. But it was not the end of the matter; in fact it was rather just the beginning. The court proceedings and decisions in connection with the validity of the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta introduced other disquieting factors in respect of the observance of this standard.\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted above that in spite of the modification of the capital structure of Ukrtatnafta having been unanimously agreed by its shareholders, with the concurrent participation of high level Ukrainian government officials, the Prosecutor commenced proceedings before the Kyiv Economic Court on 19 December 2007 resulting in Case 32/1. It must be recalled that this official had already investigated Ukrtatnafta\u2019s foundation in the period 2002-2003, and that its renewed efforts to reexamine the modifications in question coincides with the fact that Korsan, the company controlled by the Private Group, had acquired in January 2007 a 1% shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. The Tribunal\u2019s concerns regarding FET are not appeased by tire increasingly questionable role of the Prosecutor and the connection in time between the proceedings initiated and the interests of Korsan or related companies in expanding their control of Ukrtatnafta.\n\n403.\n\nThe examination of the various complaints the Claimant makes about the breach of FET allows the Tribunal to conclude that in some respects this was indeed the case. The Claimant was beyond doubt deprived of the control and management of Ukrtatnafta, and ultimately of its ownership. First, it claims that the Respondent subjected the investments of the Claimant to arbitrary and unreasonable measures, including the deprivation of control, management, and ownership of Ukrtatnafta. The Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that such deprivation is implausible as such control, management and ownership was never the Claimant\u2019s to begin with, given its minority shareholding, is formally correct, but the reality of the corporate arrangements that had been put into effect by agreement of the shareholders proves otherwise. It was Tatneft that had been entrusted with the task of managing the company and while new corporate arrangements are always possible, in the instant case these did not follow the normal corporate decision-making process but were the result of judicial intervention and the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko. In any event, even if only the status of a minority shareholder is considered, that Claimant was deprived of ownership is not open to question.\n\n404.\n\nThis situation is in itself contrary to the fairness that could be expected in terms of the treatment of a foreign investor, irrespective of whether such acts might originate in the judiciary or the government itself, including the role of the Prosecutor therein, particularly in light of the Prosecutor\u2019s office being an executive organ under the authority of the Presidential Administration. Due process issues and procedural propriety were, as the Claimant argues, also compromised in the development of this process before the courts, especially in view of the again questionable role of the Prosecutor, particularly as far as the reopening of cases beyond the limits of the statute of limitations is concerned, as this was not an isolated event but a continuing one. The Tribunal is mindful of the Claimant\u2019s argument to the effect that the overly powerful role of the Prosecutor in Ukraine has been a matter of criticism because of non-compliance with European standards on democracy and the rule of law.657\n\nEuropean Commission for Democracy Through Law (Vanice Commission), Opinion on the Draft Law of Ukraine on the Office of the Public Prosecutor, Opinion No. 539/2009 of October 27. 2009, \u00b6 5 (CLA-354): European Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission), Opinion on the Draft Law of Ukraine on the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Ukraine, Opinion No. 667/2012 of October 15, 2012, \u00b6 6 (CLA-355): Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\n405.\n\nThe discussion about whether these various decisions amounted to a denial of justice is immaterial because what this Tribunal has to determine in the end is whether they were manifestly unfair and unreasonable. Although the qualification of such decisions being \"manifestly\" unfair and unreasonable, on which the Respondent relies in support of its position, is not always easy to establish in individual cases, if the process is considered as a whole in light of the approach explained above, it certainly could not be concluded that it is fair and reasonable. No decision invalidating direct and indirect ownership of a company could be so considered unless the reasons for it are overwhelming and unequivocally based on the law having been gravely breached unless the reasons for it are based on a serious breach of the law. A case which began on an alleged breach of the Labor Code and escalated to massive deprivation of ownership does not appear to be justified on these grounds,\n\n406.\n\nThe many procedural defects that have intervened in the judicial proceedings discussed also cast important doubt on the degree of compliance with the FET standard. This is particularly noticeable in respect of the various *ex parte* decisions noted and the questions concerning proper service of some such decisions, with particular reference to the cassation appeal in Cases 28/198 and 28/199. The overall observance of due process throughout these cases cannot be thus considered satisfactory.\n\n407.\n\nA further claim concerning the breach of FET relates to the frustration of legitimate expectations by the Respondent of a predictable, consistent and stable legal framework for the Claimant\u2019s investments, as considered, for example, in *CMS* and *Biwater.* The Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that such requirement of FET only applies to administrative acts is not convincing. A predictable, consistent and stable legal framework is a FET requirement which ought to be safeguarded in its integrity irrespective of which organ of the State might compromise its availability as is well recognized under international law in the context of attribution of wrongful acts. It does not matter, as the tribunal held in *EnCana,*658 whether such breach originates in the executive branch of government, which is the most common occurrence in contemporary practice given the sweeping powers of administration, or in autonomous services, such as the Public Prosecutor, or eventually in the courts themselves,\n\n*EnCana Corp.* v. *Ecuador,* LCIA Case UN3481, Award of 3 February 2006, \u00b6 158 (RLA-Douglas-19).\n\n408.\n\nDiscrimination is a ground for an additional claim concerning the breach of FET as the Claimant maintains that the different treatment accorded to Naftogaz and Korsan evidences the intention to target Tatneft, and later its associated interests, as the holders of rights to be affected by the measures taken. Whether some such judicial proceedings had Ukrtatnafta as a company, including all its shareholders, as defendants does not diminish the seriousness of a situation in which every single step was geared towards forcing the exit of the interests originally associated with the Republic of Tatarstan, in particular Tatneft followed by AmRuz and Seagroup. The finding of discrimination in such a situation is unavoidable. Even if such measures would not have entailed nationality-based discrimination, the fact that given identifiable interests are targeted indicates a discriminatory treatment as compared to that accorded to other interests in the venture.\n\n409.\n\nParticularly telling is in this respect the argument on which the whole process of deprivation was started, namely the breach of the parity requirement as originally envisaged, which was forgotten as soon as the Ukrainian-related interests took over the company, including therein Naftogaz and Korsan, as if the parity requirement no longer had any relevance.\n\n410.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s counterarguments to such claims of breach of the FET are premised on the understanding that under the international minimum standard, either as expressed in customary law or as associated to FET, the governing element of a finding of liability is \"the egregiousness of the acts constituting denial of due process,\"659 which cannot be shown for the Ukrainian court cases concerned, as the Claimant has proven neither that the Prosecutor nor that the Ukrainian courts were biased against it or otherwise corrupt. It must also be recalled that in the Respondent\u2019s view any allegation of impropriety on the part of Ukrtatnafta would not alter this conclusion, as its actions are those of a private party that was not acting under the State\u2019s control or direction.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 291.\n\n411.\n\nTo the extent that the international minimum standard can be understood in isolation from its contemporary association to FET, and furthermore understood as it was expressed at its origins, the Respondent\u2019s view is correct as a number of tribunals have in fact identified the egregious conduct as the source of liability in this context. Judicial impropriety, grave and manifest injustice and bad faith are concepts closely associated to that understanding and indeed have a very important role to play in the consideration of liability for breach of the FET. But as has been noted, such high standard is not the only one relevant in the present protection of rights under the FET. Conduct which might not be as grave as to amount to egregiousness or bad faith but which nonetheless interferes with the legitimate exercise of rights of the protected individual might equally qualify as a kind of conduct resulting in liability. This does not alter the conclusion that the mere misapplication of domestic law is not enough to give rise to liability absent some kind of adverse intention.\n\n412.\n\nIn light of the above considerations the Tribunal finds that the standard of FET has in fact been breached in this case, first on the ground of deprivation of the investor\u2019s management and control of the company and ultimately based on the deprivation of its ownership rights, not excluding discriminatory treatment, coupled with questions of due process rights and the manner of how what had been a predictable, consistent and stable legal framework resulted in the opposite. This finding relates not just to Tatneft\u2019s direct interests in Ukrtatnafta but also to those held indirectly through AmRuz and Seagroup, a matter on which the Tribunal recalls that in its Partial Award on Jurisdiction it found that there had been a composite act of deprivation in respect of the latter companies that culminated after Tatneft acquired its interests in them. The Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that the events concerning AmRuz and Seagroup occurred before Tatneft had made its investment in those companies, and thus that the damages claimed were not proximately caused by such prior events,660 is not tenable in light of the finding on the existence of a composite act that links all such events together.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 53: Transcript (19 March 2013). 24:10-25.\n\n413.\n\nThe aggregate of the events discussed can only be considered as amounting to arbitrariness and unreasonableness as far as the treatment of the Claimant\u2019s rights are concerned.\n\n**2.

The Claimant\u2019s Interpretation of the \"Full Protection and Security\" Standard\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nAs previously stated, Article 2(2) of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ukraine for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 10 February 1993 (\"UK-Ukraine BIT\")661 obliges the Respondent to accord investments of investors of the other Contracting Party the following treatment:\n\nInvestments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of the other Contracting Party, (emphasis added)\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ukraine for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 10 February 1993 (C-24).\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant defines the \"full protection and security\" standard as requiring the Respondent to provide both physical and legal protection and security to the investments of the Claimant.662 It states that the term \"legal security\" refers to \"the quality of the legal system which implies certainty in its norms, and, consequently, their foreseeable application.\"663 With specific regard to judicial decisions, this means that the host State must \"make a functioning system of courts and legal remedies available to the investor\"664 and that procedural and substantive actions of the judiciary that are not \"reasonably tenable\" would violate this standard.665\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 433; Transcript (18 March 2013), 82:1-3, 82:23-25; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 434, *citing Siemens A.

Application of the \"Full Protection and Security\" Standard to the Facts\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent breached this provision by failing to protect the Claimant\u2019s investments from the alleged criminal seizure and unlawful control and management of Ukrtatnafta, pointing specifically to the participation of the authorities of Ukraine in the alleged raider action and the failure of the Respondent to establish a proper legal framework and secure environment for the investments of the Claimant.666\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 432-449; Transcript (18 March 2013), 82:7-22, 83:9-12.\n\n417.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that any breach of full protection and security would require a demonstration that the State had encouraged or fostered the acts relating to the alleged Kremenchug seizure. The Claimant argues that the State did more than merely encourage or foster the acts relating to the Kremenchug seizure and in fact authorized and legitimized them.667 In any event, the Claimant contends that the proposition of the Respondent is unsupported by legal authority.668 The Claimant contends that the responsibility of the Respondent results from a combination of omissions and acts from its executive and judiciary branches, which made the conduct of the Respondent fall significantly below the standard of protection that the Claimant could have reasonably expected.669\n\nSecond Memorial. \u00b6 361; Transcript (18 March 2013), 55:4-13.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 362, *citing Tecmed v.

The Respondent\u2019s Interpretation of the \"Full Protection and Security\" Standard\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nWhile conceding that some tribunals have held that the full protection and security standard requires host states to provide not only physical but also legal protection and security, the Respondent states that many tribunals have refused to extend this obligation to include legal protection\u2014presumably to avoid confusing this standard with that of fair and equitable treatment.670\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 319-321.\n\n419.\n\nAfter a review of the relevant case law, the Respondent concludes that Article 2(2) of the UK-Ukraine BIT only requires Ukraine to protect the relevant foreign investment from physical harm or violence.671\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 322; Transcript (19 March 2013). 6:18-20.\n\n420.\n\nBut if the full protection and security standard extends to non-physical harm, the Respondent argues that the requirement of extending legal protection and security is satisfied for as long as the courts have acted in good faith672 and in accordance with domestic law.673\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 324-325.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 6:23-25 to 7:1-7.\n\nii. Application of the \"Full Protection and Security\" Standard to the Facts\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nIn line with its position that the full protection and security standard only protects the Claimant\u2019s investment from physical harm or violence, the Respondent first clarifies that the Claimant can invoke this provision only in connection with its allegation that Ukrtatnafta was forcibly taken over by Mr. Ovcharenko.674 However, in relation to these allegations, the Respondent reiterates its position that the events of 19 October 2007 constitute the enforcement of valid court decisions upholding Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s employment rights.675 It also argues that, even if the Claimant could show that an illegal level of force was used in reinstating Mr. Ovcharenko and that the Respondent participated in this, the Claimant cannot equate the force used on 19 October 2007 with forcible damage to its investment, because the alleged harm about which the Claimant complains was a direct result of court decisions.676\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 322.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 322.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 322.\n\n422.\n\nIf the full protection and security standard was held to oblige the Respondent to provide legal protection in addition to physical protection, the Respondent states that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the Ukrainian judiciary did not act in good faith or that the court decisions relating to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko or to the invalidation of share purchases by the Claimant, Seagroup, and AmRuz were not reasonably tenable.677\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 325.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings in Respect of the Full Protection and Security Standard**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 arguments on this particular standard of BIT protection raise the traditional divide between those who understand full protection and security as encompassing only physical protection678 and those who believe, as the Claimant does, that in addition to physical protection it extends also to legal protection and security in terms of both the quality of the legal system and the functioning of the court system.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 6:18-25 to 8:1-5.\n\n424.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that the jurisprudence of arbitration tribunals is divided. While in some cases, notably *Saluka* v. *Czech Republic, BG Group v. Argentina,* and *Rumeli Telekom* v. *Kazakhstan,* which the Respondent invokes in support of its position, this standard has been identified with police protection, on the opposite end other cases have adopted a broader interpretation and extended the standard to include legal protection, as is the case in *Azurix* v. *Argentina, Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania, Vivendi* v. *Argentina, Siemens* v. *Argentina,* and *Parkerings* v. *Lithuania,* all of which are cited by the Claimant in support of its own views.\n\n425.\n\nIn this case the text of Article 2 2. of the Ukraine-Russia BIT provides greater clarity on this discussion as it guarantees unconditional legal protection of Claimant's investments \"in accordance with its legislation\". There is here a specific link to the legal protection of the investment which is not often found in BITs. While the legislation in itself might not amount to a breach of this guarantee, this is something that might happen in the context of how the legislation is implemented or applied, which is in some respects the case here.\n\n426.\n\nAnother aspect which the Tribunal must note in the context of this discussion is that the issue of failure to guarantee the legal protection envisaged might equally bring in a close relationship with fair and equitable treatment. Article 2(2) of the Ukraine-UK BIT, also applicable in this case by virtue of the operation of the most favoured nation clause under Article 3. 1. of the Ukraine-Russia BIT (MFN) appears to have this link in mind when guaranteeing both \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\".\n\n427.\n\nThis link between the various standards of protection explains still a third line of jurisprudence in which the obligation to provide legal protection is subsumed into the concept of fair and equitable treatment, as discussed, for example, in *Enron v. Argentina, Sempra Energy International* v. *Argentina,* and *PSEG* v. *Turkey,* the latter also cited by the Respondent in support of its position. These cases do not exclude the possibility that both standards might have a standing of their own while mutually reinforcing each other. Issues concerning the role of the judiciary are particularly difficult to distinguish as to whether they should be treated under one standard or the other, or both.\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal has discussed in connection with the facts of this case the events surrounding the seizure of the Kremenchug refinery and the change in the company\u2019s management that followed, which is the basis for the Claimant\u2019s assertions about the breach by the Respondent of full protection and security. The participation of Ukrainian authorities in those events and the issue of the discontinued investigation by the Prosecutor have also been discussed above. The anomalies that the Tribunal has noted in this respect, in spite of the evidence being in some respects incomplete, are sufficient to conclude that indeed the Respondent failed to provide the appropriate police protection to the officials at the refinery at the time. Particularly telling are the subsequent participation of the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s troops in such events and the scant credibility of the argument that they intervened in the capacity of private security at the service of the company.679 The forceful entry into the premises of the refinery and the retention of certain officials in their offices, just like the carrying of weapons, are all pointing in the direction of a breach of full protection and security in the realm of police protection and physical security.680\n\nWitness Testimony of Liapka, Transcript (25 March 2013), 44:3-25 to 49:1-25.\n\nSecond Memorial \u00b6 34.\n\n429.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties have also argued about the meaning of this standard in terms of its extension to legal protection, with particular reference to the Claimant\u2019s views that the courts failed to provide adequate remedies and the Respondent\u2019s assertion that this other kind of breach would require evidence that the courts proceeded in bad faith or that the decisions adopted were not legally tenable. The Tribunal considers that these other allegations are inseparable from the context of fair and equitable treatment discussed above as they are intertwined with the contents of this other standard.\n\n430.\n\nIt should be noted that the role of a prosecutor in connection with full protection and security has also been specifically discussed in *Spyridon,* where the claim concerned a request by such official to the Romanian Supreme Court to reverse and remand an earlier decision and its acceptance by that court.681 The claim was rejected as the tribunal found that the request was reasoned, as also was the decision, and that due process was observed in light of adversarial hearings and the availability of the opportunity to challenge such request. These very aspects of due process are those that are prominently required by FET as discussed above.\n\n*Spyridon Roussalis* v. *Romania,* ICSID Case ARB/06/1, Award of December 7, 2011, \u00b6 359 (CLA-287).\n\n**3. \"Effective Means for the Assertion of Claims and the Enforcement of Rights\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\ni. The Claimant\u2019s Interpretation of Article 10(12) of the ECT\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n431.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 10(12) of the ECT to \"ensure that its domestic law provides effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights.\" The obligation to provide such \"effective means\" is, in the Claimant\u2019s view, distinct from and less demanding than the denial of justice standard of customary international law. The Claimant argues that this obligation requires the host State to establish a proper and effective legal and institutional system encompassing property and contract laws as well as procedural rules that facilitate the enforcement of such laws in domestic courts.682 The standard of effectiveness implies some measure of success, which can only be assessed on a case-to-case basis.683\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 416-417.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 88:11-16, 89:7-10.\n\n432.\n\nTo support its position, the Claimant cites *Chevron* v. *Ecuador,* and explains that the tribunal in that case defined the \"effective means\" standard as \"distinct [from] and [a] less-demanding test\" than the denial of justice test and as requiring the host State to establish a proper and effective legal institution.684\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 416; Transcript (18 March 2013), 89:24-25 to 90:1-5, *citing Chevron v.

The Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide effective means was exacerbated by the court\u2019s denial of Seagroup\u2019s request for evidence that would have established that the claims in Case 32/1 were time-barred, the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision to proceed *ex parte* in reopening Cases 28/198 and 28/199, and the denial of the right to challenge these decisions.685\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 421-422; Transcript (18 March 2013), 91:2-8.\n\n435.\n\nTo substantiate the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to ensure that the Claimant had the \"effective means\" to protect its shareholder right to have Ukrtatnafta managed by the lawfully elected Chairman, the Claimant points to the 26 September 2007 decisions, which were arrived at in *ex parte* proceedings initiated on the basis of allegedly false allegations. In the Claimant\u2019s view, these decisions contravened the legal requirements attaching to interim measures and supplementary judgments. Moreover, the courts in these decisions refused to consider Ukrtatnafta\u2019s compliance with the 9 November 2004 judgment and the shareholders\u2019 removal of Mr, Ovcharenko and rejected the Claimant\u2019s and Mr. Glushko\u2019s challenges seeking to restore the company\u2019s allegedly lawful management.686 The Claimant submits that, as a result, \"no Ukrainian court *ever* considered whether Mr. Ovcharenko had a right to be reinstated after his November 2004 dismissal by UTN\u2019s [General Shareholders Meeting].\"687\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 423-424.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 23 (emphasis in the original).\n\n436.\n\nIn the alternative the Claimant submits that, if Ukrainian law was correctly applied in these cases as the Respondent argues, the Respondent would have failed to protect the rights of the Claimant by failing to establish a proper legal system that would have protected the Claimant\u2019s interests. Specifically, the Claimant argues that it was entitled to invoke the statute of limitations to protect its interests in the context of a legal system based on law and not judicial fiat; interpreted as proposed by the Respondent, Articles 71, 76, and 80 of the Ukrainian SSR Civil Code would be inconsistent with Article 10(12) of the ECT.688 Similarly, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to the protection of the principle of *res judicata',* interpreted as proposed by the Respondent, Articles 111(15)-3, 111(16), and 53 of the Ukrainian Code of Commercial Procedure would be inconsistent with Article 10(12) of the ECT.689 The Claimant also considers that it was entitled to remove or replace the chief executive officer of the company which was under its control and to have its shareholder rights protected by safeguards; as interpreted by the Respondent, Article 99(3) of the Civil Code and Articles 76, 151, 152(3), 212, and 213 of the Code of Civil Procedure would be inconsistent with Article 10(12) of the ECT.690\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 426-427.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 428.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 429.\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\ni. The Respondent\u2019s Interpretation of Article 10(12) of the ECT\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nRelying on *Amto* v. *Ukraine,* the Respondent claims that Article 10(12) can only be breached by the failure of the host state to establish legislation providing a fair and efficient judicial system.691 It thereby rejects the Claimant\u2019s reliance on *Chevron* v. *Ecuador* and *White Industries* on the basis that these cases applied a different \"effective means\" provision, which was breached by the undue delays and inaction of the state courts in considering the claimants\u2019 claims.692 Those facts thus distinguish these cases from the case at hand, where the Claimant does not allege being subjected to undue delays in the Ukrainian courts.693\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 204-208; Transcript (19 March 2013), 18:7-15.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 19:17-22.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 209-210.\n\nii. Application of Article 10(12) of the ECT to the Facts\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the assertion by the Claimant of its rights and defenses in several court proceedings, many of which involved multiple levels of review, prevents it from asserting that the Respondent has breached Article 10(12).694\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 215; Transcript (19 March 2013), 19:23-25 to 20:1-5.\n\n439.\n\nIn relation to the various proceedings at issue, the Respondent explains that the courts in Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199 considered but rejected the argument that Ukrtatnafta\u2019s claims were time-barred, a decision that was subjected to three levels of appeal.695 In Cases 28/198 and 28/199, the Supreme Court found it reasonable to grant the Prosecutor\u2019s application to set aside the lower court\u2019s judgment, and once these cases were remanded, AmRuz and Seagroup presented their arguments at three levels of court review.696 And in the proceedings relating to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, the court\u2019s decision to proceed *ex parte* was based on the failure of Mr. Glushko to appear. Apart from the fact that these court decisions were sound on the merits, they were also subject to appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, coinciding with a lawsuit by Mr. Glushko against Ukrtatnafta and Mr. Ovcharenko in this same matter.697\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 210.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 211.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 212-214.\n\n440.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the application of Ukrainian law in the stated instances proves the Respondent\u2019s failure to establish a proper legal system that meets the requirements of Article 10(12) of the ECT, the Respondent states that the Claimant\u2019s dissatisfaction with certain court decisions cannot support its claim for breach of Article 10(12) given the ability of the Claimant, Seagroup, and AmRuz to invoke their rights before the courts under proper procedures. The \"effective means\" standard does not guarantee results in individual cases. As the Respondent points out, the present Tribunal cannot act as an appellate court and must defer to the decisions of the lower courts.698\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 215.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings in Respect of the Effective Means Standard**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal has discussed above the factual and legal questions concerning both denial of justice and the availability of effective means for the assertion of claims and enforcement of rights. As liability has already been found in the light of the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security standards, there is no need to examine the question of effective means separately, which is to a large extent subsumed under that standard.\n\n442.\n\nThere is, however, a broader question concerning how deferential arbitral tribunals should be in respect of court decisions. As this issue permeates the whole discussion on liability it will be considered separately further below.\n\n**D. THE PROHIBITION ON UNLAWFUL EXPROPRIATION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nArticle 5(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT states as follows:\n\nThe investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties, carried out in the territory of the other Contracting Party, will not be expropriated, nationalized, or subject to measures equal in consequences to expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") except for cases in which such measures are applied in the public interests in accordance with procedures established by legislation, are not discriminatory and accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent committed a creeping expropriation or an expropriation through a composite act by pointing to the series of actions and omissions of the executive and judicial branches of the Respondent in assisting with the takeover of the refinery on 19 October 2007 and with the allegedly unlawful management of Ukrtatnafta, which eventually led to the loss of the Claimant\u2019s investment in the Company.699 Specifically, the following events allegedly form part of such a composite act: the 26 September 2007 court decisions that paved the way for the alleged Kremenchug seizure; the participation of the Respondent in the seizure and its actions to protect the raiders thereafter; the court decisions reinstating Mr. Ovcharenko; the initiation of the Prosecutor and the acceptance of the court of the time-barred claim in Case 32/1; the initiation of the Prosecutor and the acceptance of the court of the time-barred application to reopen Cases 28/198 and 28/199, respectively; and the court decisions in Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199 that resulted in the invalidation of the title of the Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup to their the Ukrtatnafta shares?700\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 95:16-25 to 95:1-2.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 431; Transcript (18 March 2013), 39:7-16.97:16-21.\n\n445.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s insistence that the Claimant is required to establish that each and every act or omission individually was in and of itself expropriatory.701 or that each of the court decisions in Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199 amounted to a denial of justice.702 although it argues that Ukraine\u2019s conduct would breach even this standard.703\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 432; Transcript (18 March 2013), 31:4-16.39:10-25 to 40:1-24.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 433-439.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 440.\n\n446.\n\nWhile clarifying that there is no requirement under international law for property to be transferred to the state for it to be expropriated.704 the Claimant argues that the Respondent did in fact benefit from the expropriation in this case, in that all of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shares are now owned by Ukrainian entities, and that the Respondent, through Naftogaz, is working with Private Group to create a jointly controlled vertically integrated oil empire.705\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 441-442, *citing Anico* v. *Indonesia* and *Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan.*\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 443.\n\n447.\n\nThe Claimant also states that the alleged expropriation was not accompanied by \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation,\" as required by Article 5(1) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT, alleging that the Respondent has always refused and continues to refuse to pay such compensation.706 The Claimant further argues that the text of Article 5(1) rebuts the Respondent\u2019s assertion that an expropriation without prompt compensation can be \"provisionally lawful.\"707\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 98:3-13.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 447.\n\n448.\n\nCharacterizing the Respondent\u2019s reliance on *General Ukraine* v. *Ukraine* as inapposite.708 the Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that AmRuz and Seagroup should have first sought restitution from the courts, stating that it could not have asserted a claim in Cases 17/178, 28/199, and 29/199 for reparation for the Respondent\u2019s violation of the Russia-Ukraine BIT in the specific form of the restitution of its shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta, as it is doing in this arbitration.709\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 448-451.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 448.\n\n449.\n\nWhile stating that the non-payment of \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" alone would render the expropriation unlawful, as the conditions of expropriation are cumulative,710 the Claimant further argues that the expropriatory conduct was also not in the public interest, because the alleged black raider action threatened public order;711 was inherently discriminatory as Ukrtatnafta is now owned entirely by Ukrainian interests in violation of the parity principle;712 and was not in compliance with Ukrainian domestic law, as required by Article 5(1) of the BIT.713\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 452.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 454.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 455; Transcript (27 March 2013), 12:22-25 to 13:1-2.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 456-457; Transcript (18 March 2013), 101:18-23.\n\n450.\n\nThe Claimant also states that the State\u2019s intent to expropriate is not a necessary element of a claim of expropriation, but if it were, then the initiation by the Prosecutor of Cases 32/1.28/128, and 28/129 was meant precisely to deprive the Tatarstan shareholders of their shares.714\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 444.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nBecause the Claimant's shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta were invalidated by specific and identifiable court decisions\u2014namely Cases 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199\u2014the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the alleged wrongdoing as a creeping expropriation.715 In doing so, it states that there is no link between either the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the initiation of Case 17/178, which was not done by the Respondent and was in any case triggered by the failure of the Claimant to contribute properly for its Ukrtatnafta shares716 or the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the alleged non-payment by Ukrtatnafta of its oil purchases.717\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 218-219,222.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 220.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 221.\n\n452.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the denial of justice standard is embedded in the concept of expropriation, and rejects the Claimant\u2019s contention that a stricter standard is warranted.718 It explains that Cases 32/1, 17/178, 28/198, and 28/199, which resulted in the invalidation of the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta, did not constitute a denial of justice, and even were the Claimant to persuade the Tribunal that these decisions were incorrectly decided as a matter of Ukrainian law, this determination would not be per se conclusive as to a violation of Article 5.719\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 223-228, *discussing Roslnvest Co* v. *Russian Federation, Saipem* v. *Bangladesh, Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan,* and *Oil Fields of Texas;* Transcript (19 March 2013), 20:20-22.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 230.\n\n453.\n\nRelying on the decision in *Swisslion,* the Respondent states that it was entitled to form the view that the Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup had failed to make the investment contributions required of them and to put that view before the Ukrainian courts.720 It further states that the invalidation of the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in the said cases does not constitute an expropriation, because the decisions were not illegal.721\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 231-233.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 234.\n\n454.\n\nEven if the Claimant could prove that the relevant court decisions constituted an expropriation (which is denied), the Respondent argues that it meets the requirements for a lawful expropriation.\n\n455.\n\nFirst, the court in Case 32/1 did not act in a discriminatory manner as it in fact rejected the Prosecutor\u2019s claim based on a violation of the parity requirement (which the Claimant alleges was discriminatory).722 The Claimant does not even explain how the Prosecutor\u2019s allegedly discriminatory intention in Case 32/1 could extend to the entirely separate court decisions in Cases 17/178.28/198, and 28/199.723\n\nTranscript (19 March' 2013), 22:20-21.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 355-357.\n\n456.\n\nSecond, the court decisions were issued \"in accordance with procedures established by legislation\" because they conformed to Ukrainian law and to the regular practice of the Ukrainian courts and did not in any case lead to grave and manifest injustice.724 Moreover, the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, which the Respondent denies was part of a raider action, had no causal link with the events said to have caused expropriation.725\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 22:21-22.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 358-360.\n\n457.\n\nThird, the courts did not violate the \"public interest\" requirement726 because the ultimate beneficiary of the impugned judicial decisions was a private party that was neither owned nor controlled by the Respondent, the premise that the Ukrainian court system is corrupt is unsupported by evidence,727 the multi-layered judicial process proves that the court decisions were rendered for a public purpose, the post-decision share transfers were canted out in accordance with Ukrainian law, and the decisions actually served a public interest, which was io enforce the terms that conditioned the contribution of the Kremenchug refinery to Ukrtatnafta.728\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 22:22-23.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 22:24-25.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 361-366.\n\n458.\n\nFourth, the courts did not breach the compensation requirement of Article 5(1) because the Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup did not, in the first place and as a condition for claiming the denial of compensation, seek restitution from the Ukrainian courts for the cash that they paid for their invalidated shareholdings. In other words, the Claimant was not compensated for its shareholdings because it did not seek to be.729\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 367-374; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 236-243; Transcript (19 March 2013). 22:25 to 23:1-4.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings in Respect of the Standard Governing Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe prohibition of unlawful expropriation commonly found in contemporary investment agreements is mainly concerned with the protection of property rights against the government abusing its legislative or executive power. It is thus mostly related to administrative and legislative acts. The issue of whether in addition an act of expropriation can also originate in the judiciary, while not in principle excluded under international law and BIT protection, is not a common occurrence and therefore views on the matter are less elaborated.\n\n460.\n\nThe discussion of judiciary expropriation has been inevitably intertwined with that concerning denial of justice and related standards, such as complete and unconditional legal protection or the \"effective means\" for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights. Ail such standards are closely associated with judicial conduct, although not exclusively so, and have been discussed above. It should also be noted that interactions with other standards can be more complex. The tribunal in *Loewen,* for example, without sufficient explanation, concluded that the expropriation claim in that case could not succeed if a breach of FET had not been previously established, thus introducing a further interaction of expropriation with other standards of protection. The *Saipem* tribunal in contrast was of the view that a Finding of judicial expropriation did not presuppose a denial of justice.\n\n461.\n\nSpecific instances of judicial expropriation, in which a court decision causes the loss of an asset in certain contexts, or of court decisions forming part of a process of creeping expropriation through the intervention of composite acts, have been identified in contemporary jurisprudence and practice. *Saipem* v. *Bangladesh* is one such relevant ease; there, the tribunal concluded that the taking of the investor\u2019s residual rights as a result of the Supreme Court decision annulling an ICC award was tantamount to measures having effects similar to an expropriation, although it cautioned that a finding of illegality in this case was of a rather exceptional nature and did not depart from the \"sole effects\" doctrine that requires total or substantive deprivation. Similarly in the *Sistem* case the abrogation of contractual rights by a court decision was equated to a measure tantamount to expropriation irrespective of the State organ that took possession of those rights. In the context of other jurisprudential developments, in addition to the illegality test, other tests concerning unreasonableness and proportionality have been applied, as held in *Occidental* (2012) or in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n462.\n\nTo the extent that a judicial decision forms an integral part of a chain of acts that, taken together, might qualify as a composite act and result in a wrong inflicted on the affected individual, such acts can justify a finding of liability under Article 15(1) of the Articles even if each of such acts individually might not be sufficient for that finding of wrongful conduct. Examples of specific instances of conduct assessed as a whole, as opposed to isolated aspects, are found in the decisions in *RoslnvestCo* v. *Russian Federation* and *Kar-dassopoulos* v. *Georgia,* although not dealing with the conduct of the judiciary in particular. In *Amto* v.\u00a0*Ukraine,* however, the tribunal specifically applied this holistic assessment to the decisions of courts and considered them in their entirety, holding in respect of the effective means standard under the ECT that the failure to offer guarantees in individual cases are not in themselves a breach of the standard but might be evidence of systemic inadequacies.730\n\n*Limited Liability Company Amto and Ukraine,* SCC Case 080/2005, Final Award of 26 March 2008. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 88 (CLA-1 98).\n\n463.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant relies on both *RoslnvestCo v. Russian Federation* and *Amto* v. *Ukraine* to support its claim of creeping expropriation, while the Respondent believes the claim concerns only a situation of direct expropriation, which it denies having taken place.\n\n464.\n\nThe facts of this case are difficult to assess in connection to the claim of expropriation. Two things, however, are certain. The first is that judicial decisions were the specific acts that in the end resulted in the total deprivation of the Claimant\u2019s rights as a shareholder of Ukrtatnafta, first by annulling the share purchase agreement with Tatneft and next by ordering the return of the shares held by AmRuz and Seagroup, with all shares being held today by Ukrainian-related interests. The shareholders related in interest to Tatarstan were thus completely eliminated from the company. Whether these events were linked in their origin to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and the taking over of the refinery is immaterial from the point of view that deprivation is a fact of the case, whatever the reasons or causes of those decisions.\n\n465.\n\nThe second certainty is that the judicial intervention was not given in isolation but was a part of the complex network of acts that led one way or another to the courts\u2019 determinations. Such acts include a role of the Respondent\u2019s government in their genesis and development. In spite of the confusing events surrounding the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, which also originates in judicial decisions, sufficient evidence exists to believe that a government hand was involved, with particular reference to the role of bailiff Pryshchepa, and, secondarily, the support evidenced by the subsequent presence on the premises of Ministry of Interior troops, in facilitating and securing, respectively, the takeover of the refinery. More important than that has been the unequivocal and questionable role of the Prosecutor in the events that followed. Most of the judicial decisions relevant in this dispute originated in the proceedings directly or indirectly initiated by such official. Although the Prosecutor\u2019s motion seeking the invalidation of Tatneft\u2019s direct shareholding was prompted by the 2007 letter of the Minister of Fuel and Energy ahead of the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko, which in the Respondent\u2019s view proves that the claimed losses were not proximately caused by the alleged treaty breaches arising from Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s reinstatement,731 the Tribunal cannot fail to note that in spite of their chronology these events are all interrelated. It must also be noted that irrespective of the autonomy of the Prosecutor\u2019s office it is a governmental service whose conduct is attributable to the Respondent.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 52 (REX-145).\n\n466.\n\nIn light of these elements of certainty the Tribunal is convinced that the role of judicial decisions in this case forms an integral part of acts of greater complexity, which evidences the existence of composite acts. The precise composition of each series of acts is difficult to establish, but again here is where their consideration as a whole leads inevitably to a finding on the existence of conduct, which in isolation might not be enough to engage liability, but in the aggregate is.\n\n467.\n\nThere are, however, other aspects where it is uncertainty that prevails, either in law or in fact. While there are cases in which it has been held that expropriation need not result in the transfer of title to property to the State, these are not common occurrences. In the instant case, the Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that the State has not benefited from the reorganization of the capital composition of Ukrtatnafta is convincing as the true successor in interest has been the private company Korsan although the increased participation of Ukrainian interest might result in an indirect benefit to the State.\n\n468.\n\nThe same uncertainty characterizes the question of the intent to expropriate. Whether this is a strict requirement as argued by the Respondent or one in which it is not the intent but the results that matter as maintained by the Claimant is again something which in the context of this case does not come up with enough clarity. Certainly the results are those the Claimant complains about but in the Tribunal\u2019s mind the intention of all the acts intervening in this case cannot be established accurately. If intent were to be a required element of expropriation, as Respondent asserts, the Tribunal has difficulty discerning whether such intent would have been that of the Respondent, as opposed to it residing elsewhere.\n\n469.\n\nThe same holds true of the requirements concerning non-discriminatory expropriation. The fact that not only Tatneft\u2019s interests were affected but also that AmRuz and Seagroup hold different nationalities would appear to support the Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that no discrimination intervenes in the cases complained about. On the other hand, it is quite evident that with or without intent all the affected interests were those related to the Tatarstan side of the equation leading to the formation of Ukrtatnafta and thus the argument that discrimination was very much present cannot be excluded to the extent that the recomposing of the capital structure is considered as a whole..\n\n470.\n\nThe Parties have also discussed whether public interest has or has not been complied with for the purpose of qualifying an expropriation as lawful, taking positions that are dramatically different in what public interest means in this context. Whether all of the above might or might not amount to a justification of public interest in the context of expropriation is another aspect where uncertainty prevails. While for the Claimant the public interest requirement has not been met in the context of the claimed expropriation, the Respondent\u2019s position as noted is that there can be no question of public interest involved as there has simply been no expropriation and the beneficiary of the impugned judicial decisions was a private party. But, the Respondent further maintains, even if considered relevant, the public interest was anyhow complied with since the aim of such decisions was to enforce the terms that conditioned the contribution of the Kremenchug refinery to Ukrtatnafta.\n\n471.\n\nIt is also to be noted that no compensation has been paid in the present case and that the situation is no different than a case of direct taking or one concerning the compulsory redemption of shares, as decided in *Rumeli* in respect of the latter. The Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that the Claimant, AmRuz, and Seagroup did not seek restitution from the Ukrainian courts for the cash that they paid for their invalidated shareholdings is not convincing.732 The Respondent maintains in this respect that in spite of the fact that Article 48 of the Civil Code provides in case of an invalid agreement for the obligation of restitution in kind or money that each party has, this has to be specifically requested from the court.733 The general principle that the courts must decide on the specific petitions of the parties as laid down in Article 83 of the Economic Procedure Code734 does not mean that a specific provision such as that of Section 2 of Article 48 of the Civil Code in respect of the consequences of an invalidation of the agreement cannot be applied by the courts on their own initiative as they have to decide not just on the invalidation but also on its consequences.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Toms, at 69; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 26, with reference to the Witness Testimony of Toms.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Belyanevich, \u00b6 10; Transcript (26 March 2013), 18:13-25 to 19:1-21; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 27, with reference to the Transcript (25 March 2013), and the discussion of the *Dekon* case.\n\nLetter of High Commercial Court of April 11.2005 (REX-122): Second Expert Report of Toms, at 69; C-551; 2005 Supreme Court Ruling. VEB-9; Transcript (25 March 2013), 101:17-25.\n\n472.\n\nOn balance the Tribunal must conclude that there are too many uncertainties in the consideration of expropriation, with some elements pointing towards a positive finding and others in a negative direction. Even if an expropriation were found to have occurred it would be of a rather unusual kind. In the circumstances the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to pass upon the claim of expropriation, especially because it has already found that the Respondent's liability under the Ukraine-Russia BIT is engaged because of the breach of other standards of protection under the BIT, with particular reference to FET and the subsumed role therein of full protection and security and the complete and unconditional legal protection of the investment as envisaged in Article 2.2 of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.\n\n473.\n\nIt must also be kept in mind that the Claimant withdrew its claim for reparation in the specific form of restitution of its shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta and opted for the claim of compensation concerning BIT breaches. The Respondent maintains in this context that a party is not prevented from seeking recovery in a separate claim.735 Remedies will be discussed further below.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Belyanevich. \u00b6 25.\n\n**4. The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions on Liability and the Discussion of the Standard of Review**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n474.\n\nBecause the claims in this case arise for the most from the decisions of courts the standard of review to be applied is still one important aspect the Tribunal needs to consider in finalizing its discussion on liability. The Tribunal is mindful that in examining judicial conduct as engaging the State\u2019s liability for the breach of an international obligation there are limits to be observed. The Tribunal is not an appellate court. Its powers are confined to the finding of whether certain conduct amounts to a breach of an international obligation and, if so, what are its consequences and remedies. The decisions in *Azinian* v. *Mexico* and *Chevron* v. *Ecuador* have rightly identified these limits, either under general international law, NAFTA standards or some specific kinds of protection, such as the \"effective means\" requirements discussed above.\n\n475.\n\nThere are, however, certain clarifications that need to be made in this context. That international tribunals ought to be deferential to domestic courts is a generally accepted proposition which this Tribunal readily accepts. While deference has been occasionally understood as finding its limits only in cases amounting to \"denial of justice,\" and the latter has been again interpreted in light of the high standards of egregiousness, manifest injustice, lack of due process, offending judicial propriety, arbitrariness, bad faith and clear and malicious application of the law, this understanding is again related to the issue of the international minimum standard discussed above. In the ambit of FET, deference is further limited by a variety of considerations arising from equitableness and reasonableness. In this sense a decision can be inequitable and unreasonable without rising to levels as dramatically wrong as those just mentioned, and still eventually engage liability for the breach of the FET standard.\n\n476.\n\nA second important clarification is that deference on the part of international tribunals requires the clear perception that domestic courts are independent, competent and above all clear of suspicion of corruption. While this perception will be many times well supported by the facts and the reputation of the court system, it has also known exceptions.\n\n477.\n\nTribunals have hesitated to consider the merits of a particular judicial decision for a determination of the breach of an international obligation and the engagement of liability related thereto, a case in point being that of *Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd.* in connection with the full protection and security standard, and have rather opted for the test that if it is believed the courts have acted in good faith and its decisions are reasonably tenable there should be no finding of liability. And even where a tribunal has considered the merits of a court decision, as in *Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul* v. *Republic of Tajikistan,* the reasonably tenable test has prevailed.\n\n478.\n\nA further elaboration of deference is found in the case of *Chevron* v. *Ecuador* and its reliance on the test of whether a decision has resulted in \"manifest injustice\", in which case deference might not be justified, a concept which in turn is measured in light of what can be regarded as \"reasonably tenable\" or a conclusion that can be \"legitimately reached\" or that is \"juridically possible\". But even then deference might not extend to other defects of a court decision, such as undue delay. These distinctions suggest that different standards of review might apply in relation to different types of wrong.\n\n479.\n\nThis Tribunal, having examined the various court decisions complained of and the arguments on which they are based, is not at ease with an unrestricted application of the standard of deference. Some aspects of such decisions can be considered reasonably tenable, but these are rather exceptional. For the most part, the explanation given by the courts in support of their findings have not been convincing and appear rather as an endorsement of the Prosecutor\u2019s arguments, not unrelated to those of the interests behind such arguments. This does not necessarily mean that bad faith might have intervened, at least not in all cases, but it certainly requires that the standard of deference be appropriately qualified.\n\n480.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly has followed an approach in which the merits of the various decisions have in fact been examined in order to determine whether they can be considered as fully compliant with the BIT standards of protection, a test which in some respects has been successful but in others not. Deference is thus not automatic and certainly does not require that extreme forms of misconduct, such as egregiousness, be found to establish that breaches have occurred as a consequence of those decisions. Moreover, the process as a whole must also be taken into account for reaching a determination on whether manifest injustice lias occurred in the end. In light of this broader perspective, deference cannot stand in the way of safeguarding treaty standards of protection, and where total deprivation of the Claimant\u2019s capital contributions and of its corresponding shares and rights has been the result of the process, deference in no way precludes a finding of liability.\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded above that in this case there are no sufficient reasons to justify a finding of denial of justice. However, it is quite evident that the fair and equitable treatment standard has been compromised by a number of court actions. In this respect such standard has a broader meaning than the strict denial of justice as understood under traditional customary international law. Even though fair and equitable treatment is not always regarded as an integral part of customary law, it reflects the evolution that the very rules of customary law have experienced in the light of current treaties and jurisprudence. Denial of justice thus becomes inseparable from fair and equitable treatment and both standards will supplement each other to the point that they may be considered as expressions of the updated contents of customary law as presently understood.\n\n**E. THE ALLEGED DEBT FOR PAST OIL PURCHASES**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nThe Parties are also in disagreement as to whether the Respondent owes the Claimant any payment for oil purchases. This dispute relates to dealings involving Suvar-Kazan, the commission agent of the Claimant, and Avto, a Ukrainian company that imported Tartar oil into Ukraine.\n\n483.\n\nOn 23 April 2007, Suvar-Kazan and Avto entered into Contract No. 3-0407,736 which was a framework agreement for the supply of oil to the Kremenchug refinery for the period from April to December 2007.737 Ukrtatnafta, in turn, purchased oil from Taiz, a Ukrainian company that had purchased oil from Avto for sale to the Kremenchug refinery, both directly during the period from May to July 2007 and indirectly in September 2007, through Technoprogress Research and Production (\"Technoprogress\"), another Ukrainian intermediary.738 The oil was delivered from the Claimant to the Kremenchug refinery through a pipeline,\"739\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 136.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 130,\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 137; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 130; Transcript (13 March 2013), 48:14-20.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 510; Transcript (18 March 2013), 133:19-24.\n\n484.\n\nPursuant to an agreement with the Claimant, in January 2008, Technoprogress assigned its claims for oil payments to Taiz, a Ukrainian intermediary, which then assigned all its claims for oil payments against Ukrtatnafta to Suvar-Kazan, which accepted the assignment on 18 April 2008740\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 513; Second Memorial, \u00b6 66; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 382; Transcript (19 March 2013), 49:21-25 to 26:1.\n\n485.\n\nOn 7 May 2008, Suvar-Kazan informed Ukrtatnafta of the assignment and requested payment of the amount due.741 In response to this, Ukrtatnafta initiated proceedings in the Economic Court of the Poltava Region to invalidate the assignment agreement, on the basis that the relevant oil supply agreements between Ukrtatnafta and Taiz and Technoprogress, respectively, as well as the commission agreement between Taiz and Avto, contained prohibitions on the assignment of rights.742 The Economic Court for the Poltava Region invalidated these assignments on 2 September 2008.743 The Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the finding of invalidity on 26 March 2009.744\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 67; Transcript (19 March 2013), 50:2-4.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 67; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 132.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 68; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 135.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 51:2-4.\n\n486.\n\nMeanwhile, Suvar-Kazan filed a claim in the Tatar courts to recover the amounts owed to it.745 On 5 September 2008, the Tatar court granted Suvar-Kazan\u2019s claims and ordered Ukrtatnafta to pay the Claimant UAH 2.5 billion.746 In December 2008, the Tatar courts ordered the seizure of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shares in Tatnefteprom, which was the contribution of the Republic of Tatarstan for its shares in Ukrtatnafta, which shares in Tatnefteprom were sold at auction.747\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 50:4-8.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 50:9-13.\n\nTranscript(19 March 2013), 50:14-21.\n\n487.\n\nBetween 12 and 16 June 2009, Ukrtatnafta paid Taiz and Technoprogress the amount that was due to them under the Contract.748\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 78; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 383; Transcript (19 March 2013), 51:5-6.\n\n**1.

In the Claimant\u2019s view, UTN\u2019s non-payment to the Ukrainian intermediaries results from Mr. Ovcharenko\u2019s control over UTN, which is a result of Ukraine\u2019s facilitation of and support for the Kremenchug seizure.771\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 72, *referring to* Transcript (19 March 2013), 51:9-12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 73.\n\n499.\n\nCiting the ILC\u2019s Commentary on Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility, the Claimant further argues that, in a case where an injury is caused by the concurrent actions of a State and a private party, international practice does not support the reduction or attenuation of the State\u2019s duty of reparation.772\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 74, *referring to* *El Paso* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 687 (CLA-289), *CME* v. *Czech*  *Republic,* Partial Award, \u00b6 580 (CLA-39), *Alexandrov and Robbins,* Proximate Causation in International Investment Disputes, p. 333, (RLA-101), and *Samoan Claims,* Joint Report No. II of August 12.1904, pp. 1779, 1780.\n\n500.\n\nFinally, the Claimant disputes tire Respondent\u2019s allegation that foreseeability is a further requirement of finding liability, in addition to having a sufficient causal link between Ukraine\u2019s treaty violation and Tatneft\u2019s consequential damages, and submits that even if foreseeability were to be considered a relevant test, it was foreseeable that UTN, after a raider action facilitated and supported by Ukraine, would not make the payment of oil deliveries owed to the shareholders that had just been ousted,773\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 77-79, *referring to* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 459-462, Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 407-410, and Transcript (19 March 2013), 55:2-3 and 56:23-24.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nThe Respondent in turn states that the Claimant has no contract with either Ukraine or Ukrtatnafta for the delivery of oil that gives rise to this claim.774 'Moreover, the Respondent points out that the Claimant\u2019s claim on this specific issue is based on private transactions among private entities, and that the Claimant does not otherwise allege involvement by State organs.775 The payment by Ukrtatnafta to Taiz and Technoprogress, the two Ukrainian importers, via the parties\u2019 respective commission agents between 12 and 16 June 2009, should relieve Ukrtatnafta of all responsibility, accordingly extinguishing its debts for the oil purchases. The Respondent highlights that \"it is undisputed that in June 2009 Taiz and Technoprogress received full payment from UTN for the oil in question, but they never used those proceeds to pay Tatneft.\"776,777 The only possible involvement of the Respondent would be through the court proceedings declaring the involved companies bankrupt, but the Respondent alleges that this took place only after the completion of the so-called siphoning strategy.778 The Respondent further notes that \"[t]he Ukrainian bankruptcy courts, in any case played no role in Tatneft\u2019s alleged losses,\" and this is because the alleged siphoning scheme occurred prior to the bankruptcy proceedings regarding Taiz and Technoprogress and the subsequent order that they be liquidated.\"779\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 48:11-13.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 48:11-13.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 57.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 52:1-9.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 52;10-13.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 69.\n\n502.\n\nThe Respondent particularly highlights the importance of establishing causation for the Claimant\u2019s claim for unpaid oil deliveries. The Respondent submits that it cannot be established that any breach of the BIT by the Respondent resulted in the Claimant\u2019s loss of payment for its oil deliveries.'780 In particular, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot show that the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko (even assuming that such was a treaty breach, which is denied) was the \"efficient and proximate cause\" of the losses'781 or that the Ukrainian courts or bailiffs involved in it could have reasonably foreseen that losses would be suffered by the Claimant and in that particular way.782 As regards the former issue, the Respondent points out that the current liabilities of Tatneft exceeded its current assets as of 19 October 2007, which means that its financial position was poor and was worsening.783 It also notes that the claim of Tatneft actually arises out of events that are additional to and separate from the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko and, as further explained below, can be attributed to private parties, which means that the State cannot be liable for them.784\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 53:25 to 54:1-6; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 61.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 54:7-16, 58:4-18; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 60.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 55:2-22.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 55:2-22; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 60.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.\n\n503.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the issues of proximity and causation are linked.785 In relation to the issue of proximity, it clarifies that the damages claimed must have been reasonably foreseeable in accordance with an objective standard, or that \"the claimed losses would have been foreseeable to a reasonable man in the position of the wrongdoer.\"786 The Respondent then contends that no reasonable person could have foreseen the chain of events that the Claimant contends led to its unpaid oil sales.787\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 56:23-25 to 57:1-12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 68.\n\n504.\n\nThe Respondent also points out that Ukrtatnafta entered into the oil delivery contracts with Taiz and Technoprogress before Mr. Ovcharenko was reinstated and had therefore never assumed responsibility with respect to Tatneft, which had entirely assumed the risk of non-payment by Taiz and Technoprogress.788\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 55:23-25 to 56:1-4; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 59.\n\n505.\n\nDiscussing *Samoan Claims,* the Respondent reiterates that it is insufficient for the Claimant to show that the Respondent created the opportunity for the misdeeds of private actors.789 It clarifies that this case limits the losses for which a State must be held accountable to those that immediately result from the State\u2019s international misconduct. '790 The Respondent argues that the siphoning strategy\u2014which consisted of entirely private transactions that were not connected to the State\u2014described by the Claimant actually constitutes an intervening event that breaks the chain of causation between the alleged BIT breaches of the Respondent and the harm complained of here.791\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 57:21-24; 58:19-25 to 59:1-5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 65\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 59:6-15; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 62.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Consideration of the Facts and Liability Concerning the Oil Purchase Claim**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nThe Tribunal must now consider the facts concerning this separate but related claim that Tatneft has submitted, namely whether the Respondent is responsible for others' failure to pay for the oil that Tatneft had delivered to the Kremenchug refinery, and what the role of the various intermediaries that had intervened in these transactions was. The recourse to intermediaries was apparently justified by tax benefits.792 related to VAT particularly,793 a policy that has been criticized by the Respondent as being contrary to Ukraine\u2019s tax legislation and which appeared to have used to some effect the address of the trade mission of the Republic of Tatarstan in Kyiv.794\n\nWitness Statement of Grafsky, \u00b6\u00b6 5-i 1.\n\nWitness Statement of Vilkova, \u00b6\u00b6 5-20.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Liapka, \u00b6 14; Witness Testimony of Liapka; Transcript (25 March 2013), 25:21-25 to 29:1-8.\n\n507.\n\nFollowing transactions entered into in 2007, Technoprogress assigned in 2008 its claims for the payment of delivered oil to Taiz, the latter in turn assigning these claims to Suvar-Kazan, which accepted such assignment. At that point, the rights to such pending payments passed from the hands of Ukrainian companies to the commission agent for the Claimant. Suvar-Kazan soon thereafter, as explained above, requested payment for the amount due from Ukrtatnafta with the latter initiating proceedings to invalidate the assignment agreements. The assignments were subsequently invalidated.\n\n508.\n\nThe facts of the case on this point show that Ukrtatnafta proceeded to pay in full the pending amounts to both Taiz and Technoprogress, a step that the Respondent believes should relieve it of all responsibility as it extinguished the debt. The terms of this dispute do not appear, however, to be that simple, for the Claimant alleges that the payments made were orchestrated in a manner such that the amounts due would never reach its accounts. In fact, following payment both Taiz and Technoprogress were liquidated and their assets disbursed by means of inter-group transfers without ever allowing the Claimant to collect.\n\n509.\n\nWhile the legal issues arising from this aspect of the dispute will be discussed below, the Tribunal cannot fail to note at this stage two facts that are of concern. The first is the extensive use of intermediaries. Admittedly this is a common practice in the oil trade, but in the instant case it appears to have been taken beyond normal transactions, particularly in view of the fact that the oil was delivered by means of a single and continuous pipeline. The Tribunal does not draw conclusions from this fact at this point but notes that it certainly raises doubts about the transparency of the process and its eventual propriety.795 The second fact to be noted is that at this point the intra-group transactions were indeed most active in view of the interest of some of the Ukrainian shareholders to gain control of Ukrtatnafta. These transactions were not unrelated to the role of such intermediaries, including their role in receiving and conveying debt payments made to them by Ukrtatnafta.796\n\nWitness Testimony of Fedotov; Transcript (20 March 2013), 24:4-25 to 25:1-16.\n\nWitness Testimony of Liapka; Transcript (25 March 2013), 33:10-25 to 40:1-3.\n\n510.\n\nAs explained above, the Claimant believes in this connection that although payments were made to Taiz and Technoprogress as the intermediaries in the oil deliveries, these payments never reached Tatneft as they were orchestrated in such a way as to be diverted by means of intragroup transfers and the liquidation of the intermediary companies.797 It is on this basis that the Claimant maintains that the Respondent is liable for payment of the amounts owed to Tatneft. The Respondent believes to the contrary that, as payment was in fact made, it is relieved of all responsibility towards the Claimant and that whatever claim is pending concerns solely the relationship between the supplier and those intermediaries. The Respondent has further noted that Suvar-Kazan holds an enforceable judgment against Ukrtatnafta and that this judgment has been in part enforced with the seizure in Tatarstan of Ukrtatnafta shares in Tatneftprom for an amount of US$ 105 million.798\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 67-74; Transcript (27 March 2013), 2:19-25 to 4:1-4.\n\nDecision of the Arbitrage Court of the Republic of Tatarstan. City of Kazan dated 5 September 2008 (REX-40) and Enforcement Order No. 265221 by the Arbitration Court of Tatarstan dated 3 December 200S (REX-134).\n\n511.\n\nThe Tribunal has expressed above its reservations about the role of intra-group transactions in this respect, steps that were not unrelated to the role of such intermediaries. The Respondent also explains that intermediaries significantly marked up prices for the oil sold. This role notwithstanding, both Parties agree that Ukrtatnafta made the required payments to the intermediary companies. The issue is thus whether such payment extinguished any legal obligation to pay for the oil delivered and thereby relieved the Respondent from liability.\n\n512.\n\nThe Respondent has convincingly argued that there was no contract between Ukrtatnafta, or for that matter Ukraine, and Tatneft for the delivery of oil799 and that many of the contracts concluded between Ukrtatnafta and Taiz and Technoprogress were done prior to the reinstatement of Mr. Ovcharenko when Tatneft was in control of the company.800 Such payments, the Respondent explains, could not have been made earlier, as the Claimant maintains, because the financial situation of Ukrtatnafta had been worsening.801\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 48; 11-25 to 49:1-32.\n\nAudit Report from the Chief Control and Audit Office of Ukraine, 5 May 2008 (REX-26); Transcript (20 March 2013), 18:1-13 and 15-25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 60.\n\n513.\n\nIt follows that there is no causal link, certainly not a proximate one, between the wrong eventually suffered by Tatneft and the conduct of Ukrtatnafta, which fully discharged its obligations in this matter. The Tribunal cannot make a finding of liability in light of the separate legal and contractual relations between the Claimant and the intermediaries, not even in terms of the allegation of consequential damages invoked by the Claimant.\n\n514.\n\nTo the extent that it could be established that Ukrtatnafta, and for that matter the Respondent, orchestrated such payments with a view to frustrate the Claimant\u2019s rights, this might be an appropriate consideration concerning liability in light of the FET. The Tribunal is not insensible to the argument that Intra-group transactions intervened in the handling of such payments, but does not believe that Ukraine\u2019s intervention has been clearly established as a matter of fact and this therefore remains a presumption that is not sufficient to conclude that liability has been engaged for Ukraine. The Respondent rightly points out that Ukraine cannot be held accountable for the actions of private parties that might have occurred in this context.802\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 64.\n\n515.\n\nThe Parties have also discussed the *Samoan Claims* in this connection. The Claimant relies on this decision in support of its view that State conduct creating an opportunity for private parties\u2019 misdeeds is enough to establish a proximate cause linking the damages to the Respondent\u2019s conduct, just as it relies in this respect on the ILC Commentary on Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility.803 The Respondent asserts to the contrary that what was excluded in that case were the damages which were not the immediate result of military operations by the State.804\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 74.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 65.\n\n516.\n\nThe Claimant believes that Ukraine not only created an opportunity for the alleged raiders to take over Ukrtatnafta but also that the courts and the executive collaborated with them to achieve this objective and ultimately arranged for the siphoning of oil payments to Privat-controlled companies.805 While elements of State participation in facilitating such schemes are present in the evidentiary record of this case, again principally because of the court\u2019s decisions on bankruptcy, what is lacking is the evidence concerning the causal link between these elements and the resulting damage as far' as the claim for unpaid oil deliveries is concerned. *Samoan Claims* is thus of no avail in this situation.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 76.\n\n517.\n\nFurther arguments have been made in connection with *Alpha Projecktholding* v. *Ukraine* insofar as liability was found in respect of consequential losses arising from the proven fact that the respondent had ordered the cessation of payments to the claimant in that case, a situation which the Respondent in the instant case believes to be inapposite, and which in fact is different from the insufficient evidence here available.\n\n518.\n\nThe Parties have also discussed the foreseeability of damages and how this element should relate to the question of liability and compensation for unpaid oil deliveries. The Respondent maintains that no damage arising from these debts was reasonably foreseeable806\u2019 and hence that the claimed damages amount at most to an indirect or remote damage as far as the Claimant is concerned,807 a view which is disputed by the Claimant for whom the liability here is related more to torts than to contractual breaches and who therefore contends that foreseeability is not a basis to limit the recovery of losses.808\n\n*Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.* Decision No. 7 of 27 July 2007, \u00b6 13 1 RLA-99).\n\n*BiwaterGauffv.

This remoteness is what the Tribunal does not consider to be compensable.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 68.\n\n**VI. REMEDIES**\n----------------\n\n520.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal has concluded that the Respondent bears international responsibility or liability in principle\u2014toward the Claimant under the Russia-Ukraine BIT as a result of Its conduct in the period between 2004 and 2007 and the associated bieaches of certain BIT provisions. Accordingly, the Tribunal must next consider the legal consequences of the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.\n\n521.\n\nThe Parties differ significantly in respect of the standard of reparation that they contend should apply to breaches of the BIT, (the forms of reparation (restitution and compensation) that would be owned (until thie Claimant withdrew its request for restitution) and, in the event that compensation is owned, the methodology for establishing the appropriate amount of compensation and interest. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Parties\u2019 pleadings on these points, it has also taken due note of the evidence submitted by both Parties and has found the examination of tne quantum experts of both sides at the hearing to be of great assistance in clarifying the differences between the Parties.\n\n**A. THE STANDARD OF REPARATION**\n---------------------------------\n\n522.\n\nA first point of contention between the Parties is the standard of reparation that applies for breaches of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. In short, the Claimant argues that it is entitled to \"full reparation\" as defined in customary international law, as it was subject to unlawful treatment. In the Claimant\u2019s view, the compensation standard of Article 5(2) of the BIT applies only in cases of lawful expropriation. The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that, should the Tribunal find liability in principle, the standard of compensation to be applied, whether there has been a lawful or unlawful expropriation, is that defined by Article 5(2) of the BIT, which replaces customary international law as a lex *specialis.*\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the standard of \"full reparation\" under customary international law applies to its claims for damages. In this regard, the Claimant recalls the pronouncement by the International Court of Justice in the *Chorzow Factory* case that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"811 The Claimant argues that the same standard of full reparation is now codified in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,812 and has been adhered to by the International Court of Justice,813 regional courts,814 and arbitral tribunals.815\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 488, referring to *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzmv, Claim for Indemnity (Germany* v. *Poland),* PCIJ, Judgment on the Merits of 13 September 1928, Series A, No. 17, p. 47 (CLA-240). *See also* Transcript (18 March 2013), 107:10-17.\n\nArticle 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides: \"1.

Such becomes clear, in the Claimant\u2019s view, through the plain language of Article 5(2), which provides:\n\nThe amount of such compensation should correspond to the market value of expropriated investments immediately prior to such expropriation or immediately prior to the official announcement of such expropriation; furthermore, such compensation will be paid immediately, taking into account interest charged from the date of expropriation until the date of payment at the interest rate for three months\u2019 deposits in US dollars at the London interbank market rate (LIBOR) plus 1%, and will be in liquid, marketable form and freely transferable.816\n\nRussia-Ukraine BIT (C-23). This is based on the English version as translated from Russian, which was provided by the Claimant.\n\n525.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the phrase \"such compensation\" in Article 5(2) refers to \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation that needs to accompany any expropriatory measure, for such a measure to be lawful under Article 5(1).\"817\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 468.\n\n526.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the legal consequences of unlawful expropriations and breaches of the BI f other than expropriation\u2014for which the Russia-Ukraine BIT does not specify standards of reparation\u2014should be determined according to the customary international law of State responsibility'.818 in the absence of \"such *lex specialis.819*\n\n*Id.*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 483. *See also* Transcript (18 March 2013), 106:18-23.\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the distinction between lawful expropriation and unlawful acts, as set out in the *Chorzow Factory* case, has been widely accepted by investment treaty tribunals.820 In this regard, it refers to the analysis of the tribunal in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina:*\n\nThe Treaty thus *mandates* that compensation for *lawful* expropriation be based on the *actual value* of the investment, and that interest *shall* be paid from the date of dispossession. However, it does not purport to establish a *lex specialis* governing the standards of compensation for *wrongful* expropriations. As to the appropriate measure of compensation for the breaches other than expropriation, the Treaty is silent. In the *Chorzow Factory* Case, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) set out the following principles of compensation for *unlawful* acts by states: [...]. There can be no doubt about the vitality of this statement of the damages standard under customary international law, which has been affirmed and applied by numerous international tribunals as well as the PCIJ\u2019s successor, the International Court of Justice. It is also clear that such a standard permits, if the facts so require, a higher rate of recovery than that prescribed in Article 5(2) for *lawful* expropriations.821\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 484, *referring to Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzow, Claim for Indemnity (Germany* v. *Poland),* PCIJ, Judgment on the Merits of 13 September 1928, Series A, No. 17, p. 47 (CLA-240).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 484, *referring to Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 8.2.3-8.2.5 (CLA-170) [italics in original]. *See also* *Waguih Elie Siag and Clorinda Vecchi* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case ARB/05/15, Award of 1 June 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 539-540 (CLA-191) ; *Saipem S.p.A. v.

The Respondent claims that Article 5(2) should apply even to an unlawful expropriation (assuming that such were proven by the Claimant) because \"Article 5 does not distinguish between lawful and unlawful expropriation.\"843 The Respondent also refers to an article by an experienced practitioner, Mr. Sheppard, to argue that \"[t]he compensation payable [for both, lawful and unlawful expropriation] is that prescribed by the treaty provision.\"844 Following Mr. Sheppard\u2019s argument, the Respondent maintains that the standard prescribed in the investment treaty as \"a *lex specialist* supersedes \"the *lex generalist* of customary international law in all cases of expropriation.845\n\n*Id,* \u00b6384.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 384.\n\nId,\u00b6 385, *referring to* Audley Sheppard, *The Distinction Between Lawful and Unlawful Expropriation,* World Arbitration and Mediation Review (2008), vol. 1, no. 1-2, p. 158 (RLA-91).\n\n536.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent contends that Article 5(2) should not be disregarded in favor of Article 3(1)\u2014the most-favored nation clause\u2014because such an approach would ignore what has been carefully negotiated between and agreed to by Russia and Ukraine: Article 5 does not entitle investors to \"full reparation.\"846 According to the Respondent, \"[t]he Tribunal should not be enticed \u2018to stray from the path\u2019847 in deciding what compensation, if any, to grant the Claimant\"848 As regards the application of Article 3(1) more specifically, the Respondent argues that the standard of compensation under customary international law does not qualify as \"a regime provided for investors of any third state\" in Article 3(1).849\n\n*Id,* \u00b6\u00b6 386-388.\n\nId., \u00b6 388, *referring to Amoco.* 15 Ir-USCTR 289, 14 July 1987, p.298, (CLA-247).\n\n*Id.*\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 419.\n\n537.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent points out that the Claimant\u2019s reliance on the Chorzow Factory case is inapposite because the circumstances in that case differ from those in the present case. Under the 1922 Geneva Convention that was applicable in the Chorzow Factory case, expropriation was prohibited with very limited exceptions, \"which were not equivalent to the conduct requirement in most modem BITs.\"850 Moreover, the 1922 Geneva Convention did not specify any standard of compensation.851\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 390, *referring to* Audley Sheppard, *The Distinction Between Lawful and Unlawful* Expropriation, World Arbitration and Mediation Review (2008), vol. 1, no. 1-2, p. 148 (RLA-91).\n\n*Id.*\n\n538.\n\nTire Respondent also claims that the Claimant\u2019s reliance on the *Amoco* case is erroneous, as the Claimant actually refers to a concurring opinion of one of the judges of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal who concluded that a treaty standard of compensation applied to both lawful and unlawful expropriation.852 It further cites a series of awards by investment tribunals, which allegedly follow a similar approach.853\n\n/cf, \u00b6 391, *referring to Amoco,15* Ir-USCTR 289, 14 July 1987, p.298, (CLA-247).\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 394-395, *referring to* *Wena Hotels Ltd.* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt.* ICSID Case ARB/98/4, Award, 8 Dec. 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 118, 125.

The Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n------------------------------\n\n539.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Tribunal has not relied on the claim of expropriation in reaching its findings on liability, the discussion on its alleged lawfulness or unlawfulness and the applicable standards of reparation are not relevant for the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions in this case.\n\n**B. FORMS OF REPARATION**\n--------------------------\n\n540.\n\nHaving found that the Respondent has breached the BIT under other grounds and bearing in mind that the BIT does not specify any particular remedy for such breaches, the Tribunal will apply the \"full reparation\" standard under customary international law as described in the *Chorzow Factory* case referred to above by tire Parties. As mentioned by the Claimant, that standard has now been codified in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and applied consistently by the International Court of Justice, regional courts, and arbitral tribunals.\n\n541.\n\nThe Parties also disagree on the form of reparation that should be awarded by the Tribunal, if it so finds the Respondent to be in breach of the Russia-Ukraine BIT. In particular, the Respondent challenges the Claimant\u2019s view that restitution is available under the BIT. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant withdrew its request for restitution of its direct and indirect shareholdings in UTN, together with the control and management rights associated with these shareholdings, due to \"the apparent practical impossibility of restitution\".854 In the event that the Tribunal awards compensation, the Parties differ greatly as to its quantification.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, footnote 146.\n\n**1. Restitution**\n------------------\n\n542.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, during the course of the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant did not pursue its argument on restitution, and, in its Post-Hearing Brief, after indicating in footnote 146 that it is withdrawing its request for restitution, its claim for full reparation calls exclusively for the payment by the Respondent of damages in the amount of US$ 1,144 billion.\n\n543.\n\nIn order to remove any ambiguity, the Tribunal wishes to state that it does not consider the present case as one where restitution would be an appropriate means to ensure appropriate reparation to the Claimant.\n\n**2. Compensation**\n-------------------\n\n544.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already ruled that there is no breach of the BIT by the Respondent in connection with the non-payment of oil deliveries, it needs only to address the claim for the loss of shares (with interest).\n\n545.\n\nThe Claimant requests an award of compensation for losses arising from the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Russia-Ukraine BIT.855As noted above, the Claimant initially requested direct and consequential damages of \"at least\" US$ 741 to 842 million.856 It subsequently totaled its losses at US$ 793 million to US$ 1,073 billion, \"depending on the applicable rate of interest.\"857 At the oral Hearing, the Claimant requested compensation in an amount of US$ 1,073 billion, composed of 536 million for the loss of shares (with interest) and 537 million for the alleged unpaid oil deliveries.858 In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant requests compensation in an amount of US$ 1,444 billion, comprising US$ 591 million for losses related to Tatneft\u2019s shareholdings in UTN (including US$ 358 million for the value of Tatneft\u2019s allegedly expropriated shares and US$ 233 million in interest859) and US$ 533 million for losses related to the unpaid oil deliveries (including US$ 334 million for outstanding payment on the oil deliveries, RUR 1,569,351.070 of tax fees (VAT and associated default interest) and US$ 143 million in interest).860 In presenting its arguments, the Claimant relies principally on two expert reports by Mr. Mark Bezant of FTI Consulting (the \"First Bezant Report\" and the \"Second Bezant Report\").\n\nThe Claimant had sought compensation for the alleged loss of its role as the principal supplier of oil to the Kremenchug refinery in its First Memorial (see Memorial, \u00b6 503), but did not quantity its loss in subsequent submissions and during the Hearing.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 482,527.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 460.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 12:10-17.\n\nInterest figures are calculated up to May 27.2013, Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, footnote 144.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 66.\n\n546.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the actual fair market value of the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholdings is between US$ 7.9 million to US$ 9.6 million.861 In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent estimates the fair market value of Tatneft\u2019s shareholdings to be no more than US$ 15.8 million to US$ 19.2 million.862 In support of its argument, the Respondent relies principally on two expert reports by Baker & O\u2019Brien (the \"First Baker & O\u2019Brien Report\" and the \"Second Baker & O\u2019Brien Report\"). The Respondent also argues that the Claimant\u2019s claim for compensation in respect of unpaid oil deliveries is \"entirely without merit\" since the Respondent is not liable for any allegedly unpaid oil deliveries.863\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 378,435; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 449; First Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, Table 7.7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 78, *referring to* Baker & O\u2019Brien Letter dated 25 March 2013, witii connections to Second Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s Report.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 380. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Second Counter Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 450,456.\n\n547.\n\nAt first, the Claimant estimated that the fair market value of its direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta is \"at least\" US$ 204 to 305 million (in its Memorial)864 and, subsequently, US$ 222 million to US$ 358 million without interest or US$ 536 million with interest (in its Second Memorial).865 At the hearing, the Claimant again estimated that its loss of the shares is US$ 536 million (the same figure as in its Second Memorial, including interest).866 In its Post-Hearing Brief, this amount rose to US$ 591 million (US$ 358 million for the losses related to the Claimant\u2019s shares and US$ 233 million in interest).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 526; First Bezant Report, Table 2.6.\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 539; Second Bezant Report, Table i.l. *See also* Transcript (IS March 2013), 124:17 to 125:2.\n\nSecond Memorial. \u00b6 532; Transcript (18 March 2013), 12:10-15.\n\n548.\n\nThe Respondent first estimated the value of the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings to be within a range of US$ 7.9 million to US$ 9.6 million.867 Following certain corrections to its report as made by the Respondent\u2019s expert during the hearing, the Respondent adjusted its estimates to a range of US$ 15.8 million to US$ 19.2 million, with a midpoint value of US$ 17.6 million.868\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 378, \u00b6 435; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 449; First Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, Table 7.7.\n\nSecond Baker & O\u2019Brien Report (as amended on 25 March 2013), Table ES-1, p.3.\n\n**(a) Date of Valuation**\n-------------------------\n\ni.

The Respondent\u2019s Arguments\n------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Claimant for its lack of specificity in explaining the valuation date underlying its analysis, and points out that the Claimant\u2019s approach to valuation in its Memorial appears to conflict with that of its expert.876 It claims that the First Bezant Report assesses the fair market value of the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings as of the date of the alleged \"black\" raid, 19 October 2007, and subsequently decreases that value to reflect a decline in the relevant industry so as to provide a valuation on the date of the Report. This approach contradicts the Claimant\u2019s contention that it \"should be compensated as at the date of the award, if [the calculated compensation is] higher than any amount that might be calculated as at an unspecified date of expropriation.\"877\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 416.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 415- 416.\n\n553.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s approach ignores the provision of Article 5(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT, which provides that \"compensation shall correspond to the market value of the expropriated investments, prevailing immediately before the date of expropriation or when the fact of expropriation has become officially known.\"878 It submits that, pursuant to Article 5(2), the relevant valuation dates should be the dates of transfer of ownership of the shares\u2014 namely, 27 January 2010 and 12 May 2009, for the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholdings, respectively.879\n\nId., \u00b6 417 (emphasis by the Respondent), referring to BIT Article 5(2) (REX-2).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 419.\n\n554.\n\nAs a result of the exchange of a first round of Memorials, both Parties therefore now agree that the relevant dates of valuation for the loss of the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholdings are 27 January 2010 and 12 May 2009, respectively.880\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 528-529; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 419; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 528. *See also* Transcript (18 March 2013), 111:16-23.\n\niii. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings\n----------------------------\n\n555.\n\nWhile there is a huge difference between the Parties as to the actual fair market value of the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta, they agree at least on the following points: (a) that the Claimant\u2019s damages have to be measured with reference to the fair market value of its shareholdings as of the dates on which the shares were taken881 (it has to be noted however that the Claimant also argues that the value of its shares on those dates sets the floor for its losses and that it is entitled to be compensated for any increase in the value of its investments between the dates of the breach of the BIT and the date of this award882 and for its part, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not adduced any evidence of any such increase).883 (b) that the general definition of fair market value set forth in Mr. Bezant\u2019s first report, to the effect that an estimate of fair market value should be \"unaffected by factors specific to, or actions taken as a result of, this dispute but reflecting all relevant factors such as macroeconomic trends, the oil price and fuel emissions standards, for example\" should be used;884 and (c) that the subject of the valuation is Ukrtatnafta as a whole rather than the Kremenchug refinery only885.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 111:16-23; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 77.\n\nTranscript (18 March 2013), 111:23-25 to 112:1-4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 77 n. 205.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 77; First Bezant Report, \u00b6 4.5; Transcript (18 March 2013), 107:23-25 to 108:1-18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, p. 36 n. 202.\n\n556.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason not to concur with the joint view of the Parties concerning the valuation dates and the definition of fair market value. As to the argument of the Claimant concerning its alleged entitlement to any increase in the value of its investments between 12 May 2009 and 27 January 2010 and the date of this award, the Tribunal is of the view (as elaborated on below) that it has not received adequate evidence to conclude that any such increase ever did occur. The Tribunal will therefore establish the fair market value of the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect investment as of 12 May 2009 for the Claimant\u2019s indirect shareholding through AmRuz and Seagroup of 14.09% of Ukrtatnafta and as of 27 January 2010 for its 8.61% direct shareholding.\n\n**(b) Valuation Method**\n------------------------\n\ni. The Claimant\u2019s Arguments\n---------------------------\n\n557.\n\nIn the First Bezant Report, the Claimant\u2019s expert assesses the value of its shareholdings in a \"but for\" scenario, projecting the value that the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings would have had as of 15 June 2011, the date of his report, under the hypothesis that the Respondent had not breached its treaty obligations.\n\n558.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the analysis in the First Bezant Report employs a six-step approach:886 (a) deriving indicative valuation ranges of the whole of Ukrtatnafta as of October 2007 by using a number of generally accepted valuation methods;887 (b) adjusting the indicative valuation ranges obtained in (a) where appropriate to ensure that the implied value of Ukrtatnafta reflects 100% of the value of Ukrtatnafta to a shareholder with control;888 (c) assessing the appropriateness of applying a premium or a discount to reflect the potential of the shareholdings to impart greater influence or control on a strategic shareholder and/or the effect of illiquidity and other risk factors associated with minority interests in unquoted entities;889 (d) analyzing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the valuation methods to derive an estimated evaluation range for Ukrtatnafta as of October 2007;890 (e) adjusting this valuation range to 15 June 2011, taking account of the general decline in the value of refining assets in emerging Europe and Turkey since October 2007;891 and (f) calculating the combined fair market value of Tatneft\u2019s 22.7% shareholdings (including Tatneft\u2019s indirect shareholding through AmRuz and Seagroup of 14.09% and Tatneft\u2019s 8.61% direct shareholding) in Ukrtatnafta on the basis of the adjusted June 2011 valuation range.892 On this basis, the First Bezant Report estimates that the fair market value of Tatneft\u2019s 22.7% shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta as of 15 June 2011 is US$204 to 305 million, without accounting for the modernization of the Kremenchug refinery.893\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 530.\n\nFirst Bezant Report, \u00b6\u00b6 4.27-4.69. The valuation methods employed in this part include valuation based on transactions in Ukrtatnafta shares (\u00b6\u00b6 4.27- 4.34), investment analyst valuations (\u00b6\u00b6 4.35-4.37), valuation using replacement cost as a benchmark (\u00b6\u00b64.38-5.53), valuation based on quoted Ukrainian refineries (\u00b6\u00b6 4.54-4.62), valuation based on European refineries (\u00b6\u00b6 4.63-4.67), valuation based on transactions in comparable refineries (\u00b6\u00b6 4.68- 4.69). *See also* Transcript (18 March 2013), 112:14-21, 113:1 to 119:20.\n\nFirst Bezant Report, \u00b6\u00b6 4.70- 4.86.\n\nFirst Bezant Report, \u00b6\u00b6 4.87-4.94.

He also adjusted the valuation dates to 12 May 2009 for Tatneft\u2019s indirect shareholdings and to 27 January 2010 for Tatneft\u2019s direct shareholding, using the same standard valuation methods.894 Based on these adjustments the Second Bezant Report estimates the value of Ukrtatnafta as ranging from US$ 900 million to US$ 1,500 million in May 2009 and US$ 1,100 million to 1,700 million in January 2010. Accordingly, the value of Tatneft\u2019s 22.7% stake in Ukrtatnafta on these dates would be US$ 222 million and US$ 358 million.895 Mr. Bezant was instructed to add to these amounts the interest that would be due to Tatneft from the time that had elapsed between the respective valuation dates and the date of his Second Report; which results in total losses of between US$256 million and US$ 536 million, depending on which of three interest calculations he was instructed to use.896\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 535-536.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 539; Second Bezant Report, Table 1.1.

The Second Baker & O\u2019Brien Report had made certain adjustments to reflect the value of Ukrtatnafta rather than the Refinery.\n\n565.\n\nSecond, the Respondent\u2019s expert has included an estimation of the Kremenchug refinery\u2019s performance after the (alleged) wrongful conduct,911 which is contrary to the \"well established rule\" that the effects on a claimant\u2019s investment by the respondent\u2019s wrongful conduct must be disregar ded when assessing a claimant\u2019s damages.912 In this respect, the Claimant points out that the approach employed by the Respondent\u2019s expert was rejected by the tribunal in *Amco* v. *Indonesia.913*\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 569;

as such, Mr. Bezant correctly decided not to apply any discount.934\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 151. *See also* Transcript (22 March 2013), 257:14-25 to 269:1-13 for discussion on minority discount issue at the Hearing.\n\n572.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s contention that tire Claimant cannot claim losses attributable to events that occurred prior to December 2007 (such as the alleged raider action of October 2007) in respect of its indirect shareholdings,935 the Claimant contends that this is \"a fundamental misunderstanding of Tatneft\u2019s case,\" because \"[t]his case is not about a single specific event, but rather a series of actions and omissions.\"936\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 24:10-18;

The Respondent\u2019s Arguments\n------------------------------\n\n574.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the First Bezant Report contains \"a number of serious flaws,\" mostly because it has failed to apply \"the most relevant of all valuation approaches\u2014the DCF method,\" which according to the Respondent might have resulted in a negative valuation of the Kremenchug refinery.938 The Respondent also claims that the Bezant Report has made \"selective use of high-level valuation metrics to determine value\" without considering any discount for the Claimant\u2019s minority shareholding.939 The Respondent is of the view that the non-application of such a discount is contrary not only to standard industry practice but also to analysts\u2019 valuations of Tatneft\u2019s shareholding on which Mr. Bezant has himself relied.940\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 423. *See also* Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 433.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 424. *See also* Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 434-436, 438; Transcript (19 March 2013), 73:11 to 74:1; and Transcript (21 March 2013), 133:3 to 154:25 (for questions put to Mr. Bezant by the Respondent\u2019s counsel regarding the use of valuation methods and data).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 79, *referring to* Baker & O\u2019Brien Exhibitions 44-48 and FTI-37, Deutsche UFG report, dated July 10, 2007, p. 5, applying a 30% minority discount to Tatneft\u2019s stake in UTN.\n\n575.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there are two \"fundamental difficulties\" with Mr. Bezant\u2019s valuation.941 First, Mr. Bezant has chosen to disregard the overwhelming evidence of UTN\u2019s deteriorating financial performance during the period preceding the events of October 2007.942 The Respondent points out that the range of values for UTN on 12 May 2009 (US$ 900 million to US$ 1.5 billion) estimated by Mr. Bezant are 33 to 56 times greater than UTN\u2019s EBITDA in 2006 (US$ 26.9 million), the last year in which UTN earned a profit.943 Second, Mr. Bezant\u2019s valuation has been developed on the basis of \"indicators of value\" that are not only unreliable but also artificial as they bear no conceivable relationship to the reality of UTN\u2019s financial circumstances.944\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 82.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 83-90.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 83.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\n576.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should not have any regard to the amounts paid by Privat Group in three share transactions during the 2009/2010 period, which are one of the \"indicators of value\" that Mr. Bezant and the Claimant heavily relied on. First, little information is available with respect to these transactions.945 Second, these three transactions enabled Privat to obtain more than 50% of UTN\u2019s shares, while Tatneft\u2019s shareholdings (22.7%) alone would not have enabled Privat to take control of UTN.946 Third, on the Claimant\u2019s \"but-for\" theory, these transactions are part of the alleged \"black raider\" scheme that are at the heart of this dispute and are therefore of no assistance in determining what a third party would have been willing to pay for Tatneft\u2019s stake had those \"breaches\" not occurred.947 And fourth, neither Mr. Bezant nor Tatneft (or even Mr. Kolomoisky) has provided any economically rational basis for the sums that are stated to have been paid for the shares in question.948\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 97.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 98.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 99.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 100-102.\n\n577.\n\nThe Respondent argues that a DCF valuation is preferable in the present case.949 To counter the Claimant\u2019s evidence, the Respondent submits expert reports by Baker & O\u2019Brien, which deploy a DCF method. In the course of their assessment, the two Baker & O\u2019Brien Reports consider the Kremenchug refinery\u2019s historical financial performance, the outlook for refinery yields, product pricing, operating costs, and reported financial losses. The First Baker & O\u2019Brien Report estimates that the present value of the refinery is negative on a DCF method.950\n\nCounter-Memorial. \u00b6\u00b6 428-429.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 430-431; Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, \u00b6\u00b6 7.40-7.65. The Second Baker & O\u2019 Brien Report confirms the result of the First Baker & O\u2019Brien Report (Second Baker & O\u2019 Brien Report, \u00b6 1.2).\n\n578.\n\nGiven the negative result of the DCF approach, the First Baker & O\u2019Brien Report determines the value of the refinery on the basis of its net salvage value and concludes that the value of the refinery is between its net salvage value after closure\u2014US$ 50 million\u2014and the value of US$ 190 million under a scenario that involves the reconfiguration of the operation to improve profitability.951 Accordingly, the value of the Claimant\u2019s 22.7% shareholding falls within a range from US$ 7.9 million952 to US$ 36.7 million953 Certain adjustments were made in the Second Baker & O\u2019Brien Report to reflect the value of Ukrtatnafta rather than the refinery assets alone. As a result of this adjustment, the value of Tatneft\u2019s direct and indirect shareholding was estimated to be in a range between US$ 25.8 and 31.3 million..954 However, according to the Second Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, the adjustments are \"far from precise\" and do not affect the expert\u2019s opinion of the value of the Kremenchug refinery on the valuation dates.955 Following the examination of Mr. Waguespack and before the conclusion of the hearing, Baker & O\u2019Brien informed the Tribunal about a calculation error.956 According to Baker & O\u2019Brien the corrections were to reflect the exclusion of the Ukrtatnafta balance sheet item \"deferred tax assets\", which was inadvertently included in its previous reports. In its view, it is unlikely that tins item could be monetized by a buyer and it should therefore be excluded in estimating a value lor Ukrtatnafta. This results in a negative value of US$ 16-28 million for Ukrtatnafta\u2019s tangible assets and a range of US$ 22-174 million for the Ukrtatnafta share value. After the application of a 15-30% minority discount, the corrected range for the value of the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings was US$ 15.8-19.2 million, rather than US$ 25.8-31.3 million.\n\nFirst Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, \u00b6\u00b6 7.74-7.75 and Table 7.6.\n\nFirst Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, \u00b6 7.83 and Table 7.7.

With respect to the value of the refinery, the Respondent claims that it remains in the range of US$ 50 million to US$ 90 million at both valuation dates.960 The Respondent adjusted its estimates for the value of Tatneft\u2019s shareholdings to US$ 15.8 million to 19.2 million based on certain corrections to its report made by the Respondent\u2019s expert following his examination at the hearing.961\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 433 n. 714.\n\nThe figure had erroneously read \"30% discount\" in the Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 435, and was corrected in the Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 435; Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 138:15-20.\n\nBaker & O\u2019Brien Letter dated 25 March 2013, referring to corrections in Second Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s Report, p.3 and p. 39.\n\n580.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should distinguish between Tatneft\u2019s direct shareholding and indirect shareholdings, as the Claimant\u2019s indirect shares were acquired only after the (alleged) wrongful acts.962 The Respondent also argues that its valuation is consistent with the market bend during the valuation period.963 Moreover, it is not appropriate to take into account post-valuation date events in valuing Ukrtatnafta, including Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s opinion with respect to the value of Ukrtatnafta.964\n\n*Id.,* 140:9-16.\n\n*Id.,* 141:15 to 142:25. *See also* Transcript (19 March 2013), 65:11 to 69:10.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 143:1 to 144:15. *See also* Second Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 437.\n\n581.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, only Baker & O\u2019Brien has provided a reasonable assessment of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s value, based on its actual financial condition and respecting the valuation dates. The Respondent also points to Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s considerable industry experience.965 In this context, tire Respondent argues as follows: first, valuing Ukrtatnafta on a DCF basis produces a negative value;966 second, there is insufficient information concerning European refining transactions to permit a meaningful comparisons with Ukrtatnafta for valuation purposes;967 third, valuations based on quoted European and Ukrainian refineries do not provide a reliable indicator;968 fourth, analysts with less access to data than Baker & O\u2019Brien have consistently overvalued Ukrtatnafta;969 fifth, replacement cost is not a direct indicator of value;970 sixth, the transactions in Ukrtatnafta shares upon which Tatneft relies also do not provide a reliable indicator;971 and seventh, there is no valid basis for including the Tatnefteprom shares in the value of Ukrtatnafta.972\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 148:1-5.\n\nId., 146:10-12,148:9 to 169:18.\n\nId., 146:13-16,169:23 to 174:11.\n\nTranscript (27 March 2013), 146:17-19,174:12 to 175:2.\n\n*Id.,* 146:20-22, 175:3 to 176:3.\n\n*Id.,* 146:23-24, 176:4-15.\n\n*Id.,* 146:25-147:2,176:16 to 184:21.\n\n*Id.,* 147:5-25. *See also* the Second Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, \u00b6\u00b6 1.5.5.3, and 5.4.\n\n582.\n\nIn response to Tatneft\u2019s criticisms of the Baker & O\u2019Brien Reports, the Respondent first argues that the fact that UTN and the refinery continue to operate today does not undermine Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s valuation in any way since UTN and the refinery have lost hundreds of millions of US dollars since the valuation dates and continue to operate at a loss.973\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 108.\n\n583.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that Tatneft fails to specify what evidence, other than UTN\u2019s financial statements, Baker & O\u2019Brien should have considered in assessing UTN\u2019s profitability and cash flows, and that it would not only have been wrong but also reckless had Baker & O\u2019Brien not relied on financial statements to determine profitability and cash flows in the view of established practice.974\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 109.\n\n584.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s position is \"incongruous\" since it has attributed a positive value to UTN while arriving at a negative value on a DCF basis, the Respondent contends that the rationale of that position has been set out in the Baker & O\u2019Brien Reports: in order for UTN to have any prospect of providing a positive return to an acquirer on its investment, significant investment would be required to modernize and restructure the refinery, which cannot be guaranteed.975 In this context, the Respondent further argues that this is an entirely conventional approach to take with respect to a company with an unprofitable business, namely to assume either that operations will be discontinued or that they will be ' continued if a way can be found to operate the business profitably.976\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 110, *referring to* Transcript (27 March 2013), 30:10-25 and First Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, \u00b6 1.23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 111.\n\n585.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s contention that Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s assessment is in fact based on nothing but its own experience, the Respondent submits that \"it is an unfortunate truth that some questions can only be answered, and some assessments can only be made, on the basis of experience\" and \"[i]t is precisely for that reason\u2014because the answers are not available from public sources\u2014that it is sometimes necessary to consult experts, such as Baker & O\u2019Brien and Mr. Waguespack, i.e., to provide us with the benefit of their experience, and that is what Baker & O\u2019Brien has done\".977 The Respondent contends that the Claimant fails to demonstrate or allege that Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s assessment is not honest, professional or independent or that it is otherwise unreliable.978\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 112.\n\n*Id.*\n\n586.\n\nFinally, in response to the assertion of the Claimant that the Respondent failed to provide a valuation in accordance with the \"but-for\" theory, the Respondent argues that since there is no showing that UTN\u2019s cash flow would have turned positive in the \"but-for world,\" there is no basis to criticize Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s valuation in this regard.979\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 113.\n\niii. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n----------------------------\n\n587.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties\u2019 arguments and evidence in relation to the quantum of the claim, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize, at the outset, several significant points of convergence between the Parties\u2019 positions. First, there is consensus that the damages to which the Claimant is entitled in the event that the Tribunal finds liability must be measured by reference to the fair market value of its shareholdings as of the dates on which its shares were allegedly taken. Second, both Parties agree, and have instructed their experts accordingly, that these valuation dates are 12 May 2009 for the 14.09% indirect shareholding of Tatneft in Ukrtatnafta, which it held through AmRuz and Seagroup, and 27 January 2010 for Tatneft\u2019s 8.61% direct shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. Third, it appears undisputed that an estimate of fair market value should be \"unaffected by factors specific to, or actions taken as a result of, this dispute but reflecting all relevant factors such as macroeconomic trends, the oil price and fuel emissions standards\".980 Fourth, while it is evident that the Kremenchug Refinery constitutes Ukrtatnafta\u2019s principal asset, there is agreement that the valuation of the shareholdings is a function of the value of Ukrtatnafta as a whole, and not only of the Refinery.\n\nFirst Bezant Report, \u00b6 4.5.\n\n588.\n\nThat being said, the Parties\u2019 experts arrive at starkly divergent conclusions when assessing the value of Ukrtatnafta. While the Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Bezant, ascribes to the shareholdings of Tatneft a value between US$ 222 million and US$ 358 million, the Respondent\u2019s experts, Baker & O\u2019Brien, quantify Tatneft\u2019s shareholdings to be between US$ 15.8 million and US$ 19.2 million. It is evident to the Tribunal that both Mr. Bezant and Baker & O\u2019Brien have produced extensive and well-reasoned reports, accompanied by a considerable number of documentary exhibits in support of their conclusions on valuation. The stark discrepancy in figures cannot be ascribed to any failure or omission on the part of one or the other expert; it results from a reliance on different valuation methodologies, which in turn require different inputs and assumptions.\n\n589.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, none of the valuation methodologies deployed by the Parties\u2019 experts is inadequate per se. The problem lies, rather, in a lack of reliable data\u2014including information regarding Ukrtatnafta\u2019s financial performance, the technical state of repair of the Refinery and the economic prospects of refining businesses in Ukraine\u2014to enter into the equation.\n\n*Shortcomings of the Claimant\u2019s Approach*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nIn a situation of factual uncertainty, the Tribunal can understand the general approach taken by Mr. Bezant, which involved the juxtaposition of various valuation methodologies with a view to identifying a valuation range in which they converged. However, the Tribunal makes the following more specific observations that cast doubt on the reliability of the conclusions that Mr. Bezant reaches when applying these various methodologies in his report.\n\n591.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has doubts as to whether the approach of referring to market valuations of three Ukrainian oil refineries, conducted between 2004 and 2006, and eight European refining companies, developed in 2007, permits reliable conclusions as to the value of the Kremenchug Refinery (Ukrtatnafta\u2019s principal asset). The Tribunal is not aware of the specific economic, technical and financial conditions of those comparator refineries and assumes that the Parties\u2019 experts were in a similar position when preparing their reports.981 While refineries are no doubt subject to comparable challenges, their market opportunities may differ starkly, depending on the types of crude oil available, geography, political and regulatory conditions, and the prospect of synergies with companies up-stream and down-stream in the supply chain. Without a detailed analysis of the conditions under which the comparator projects operate, the Tribunal is not willing to base its valuation of Ukrtatnafta on a supposed similarity in value of such refineries.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the three Ukrainian refineries were quoted on the Ukrainian stock exchange only until 2006. and observes that the market value of these refineries in 2006 are of limited use in determining the value of Ukrtatnafta in for the agreed valuation dates. Moreover, one of the these refineries stopped operations in 2005, the second operated only periodically in recent years, and the processing history of the third is unclear but, in any event, it was not operating at the time of the expert\u2019s report of 2012. (Jacobs Report, \u00b6 4.9) As to the European refineries, Mr. Bezant himself states that none of them \"provides a close comparable to use to value Ukrtatnafta (and the Kremenchug Refinery).\" (Second Bezant Report, \u00b6 7.4).\n\n592.\n\nSecond, the various valuations of Ukrtatnafta by third-party analysts are of limited probative value. The valuations published prior to the agreed valuation dates of May 2009 and January 2010 \"are not well documented,\"982 as Mr. Bezant himself concedes, while the valuations published in 2011 are necessarily incomplete. In all likelihood, the valuations, which are all very short, were based on limited financial data and prepared without knowledge of the conditions on-site. Presumably, none of the analysts was provided, by Ukrtatnafta or its shareholders, with any inside perspective of the company. It is thus somewhat paradoxical to seek to corroborate an informed valuation of Ukrtatnafta, as Mr. Bezant\u2019s clearly is, by reference to a series of fairly superficial ones.\n\nSecond Bezant Report, \u00b6 9.14.\n\n593.\n\nThird, as both Parties have noted, a valuation based on a refinery\u2019s deferred replacement cost \"is typically not used by buyers and sellers of refineries.\"983 The deferred replacement cost of the technical installation says little about the value of Ukrtatnafta in the specific economic context of the Ukrainian refining market, with its significant geographic and geopolitical challenges and equally significant business opportunities.\n\nTranscript (22 March 2013), 5:14-19.\n\n594.\n\nFourth, the valuation of Ukrtatnafta through transactions by Privat Group in, altogether, 55.7% of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shares in 2009 and 2010984 has its own problems, although the Tribunal believes that these transactions should not be completely disregarded as indicators of value. When a buyer purchases a majority stake of a company, it will typically pay a significant premium on top of the share value to account for the acquisition of control (or at least influence) and for economic synergies that it intends to realize with other companies in its group. The Tribunal would not rule out that the amounts paid by Privat Group included a substantial premium for control, although precise figures in this connection are difficult to establish. Privat Group may also have been able to generate unique synergies between the Refinery and other Privat Group companies, comprising an extensive network of filling stations, that would not be available to a typical buyer. It is arguable that such unique business advantages should be excluded as \"factors specific to a particular buyer or seller of the asset.\"985\n\nFirst Bezant Report. \u00b6 2.13.\n\nFirst Bezant Report, \u00b6 4.4.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal is also concerned that these acquisitions may have been driven by rather idiosyncratic motivations that would not be shared by typical buyers. While the extent of Privat Group\u2019s involvement in the facts underlying the present proceedings remains opaque, the Claimant\u2019s whole case turns on the proposition that Privat Group was the beneficiary of a complex \"black raider scheme\", in which all composite events need to be viewed together. If that is the case, the purchase price paid by Privat Group in the sole-bidder auctions of 2009 and 2010 does not necessarily indicate fair market value, which should \"exclude[s] factors specific to a particular buyer or seller of the asset\"986 and rely only on considerations that are \"unaffected by factors specific to... this dispute\".987\n\nFirst Bezant Report, \u00b6 4.4.\n\nFirst Bezant Report, \u00b6 4.5.\n\n596.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal disagrees with a central economic assumption that seems to underlie Mr. Bezant\u2019s analysis\u2014that the negative financial results generated by Ukrtatnafta from the date of its incorporation in 1995 to tire seizure of the Refinery in October 2007 can be omitted from the analysis. The Claimant has sought to explain its own, and Mr. Bezant\u2019s, refusal to rely on Ukrtatnafta\u2019s financial statements for that period by alleging their lack of reliability, referring to the \"common understanding that financial statements do not necessarily reflect the value of refining assets and companies in Ukraine\"988 and stating that \"there were considerable indications that profits were far higher than the sums disclosed in the financial statements.\"989\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 123.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 119. See also Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief,\u00b6\u00b6 1 18-129.\n\n597.\n\nThe Tribunal must of course consider with particular caution the overall proposition that the financial statements of Ukrtatnafta might not accurately reflect the reality of the business of the company. However, the Tribunal equally notes that the Claimant, who was responsible for the production of these financial statements from 2002 to 2007, cannot now convincingly argue that these financial statements should not be relied upon.990 Specifically, the Claimant\u2019s witness, Mr. Fedotov, confirmed that he was in charge of the economic planning and financial departments of Ukrtatnafta from August 2001 to October 2007, thus assuming the functions of \"financial director by modern academic definition.\"991 Mr. Fedotov certainly did not suggest in his written or oral testimony that he deliberately misstated Ukrtatnafta\u2019s financial performance. The Claimant forcefully asserted, but provided no evidence of, such misstatements. On the other hand, if it were true that the financial statements prepared during that period were indeed unreliable, then the Claimant should bear the consequences of its own actions insofar as it cannot now completely disavow the credibility of these statements in the context of this arbitration.\n\nTranscript (Day 3), 156.\n\nTranscript (19 March 2013), 156:15.\n\n598.\n\nEven assuming that Ukrtatnafta\u2019s financial statements are not completely accurate, the Tribunal sees no reason not to believe the Claimant\u2019s fact witness, Mr. Fedotov, in so far as he confirmed that Ukrtatnafta did lose money during the whole period in which the Claimant was in control.992 The Tribunal is unconvinced by the Claimant efforts to explain the negative cash flow during this period by reference to allegedly significant capital investments for the modernization of the Refinery. As far as the Tribunal can tell, the money allegedly spent seems to relate more to the maintenance of the plant than to its modernization or upgrade.993\n\nTranscript (Day 3), 6-12.\n\nTranscript (Day 5). 148.\n\n599.\n\nIn consequence the Tribunal considers that the dire financial condition of Ukrtatnafta up to 2007, as evidenced by Ukrtatnafta\u2019s financial records and the testimony of the Claimant\u2019s fact witness, Mr. Fedotov, is a relevant factor in the valuation of Ukrtatnafta. That Mr. Bezant did not account for it in any of the alternative methodologies it employed is an evident shortcoming, which is likely to have resulted in a higher value for the company than objectively justified.\n\n*Shortcomings of the Respondent\u2019s Approach*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n600.\n\nTurning to the Respondent\u2019s approach to valuation, the Tribunal wishes to record, as a preliminary matter, its agreement with the Respondent that the valuation results of the \"comparable sales methodology\" are too speculative on account of there being no truly comparable transactions.994 The Tribunal therefore concurs with the Respondent that the deferred replacement value (DRV) methodology arrives at too high a valuation. The Tribunal regards it as proper that the Respondent lias set aside these two methodologies.\n\nFirst Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, \u00b6 7.25.\n\n601.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does have significant concerns in respect of the analysis of Baker & O\u2019Brien, which are a mirror image of its criticism of Mr. Bezant\u2019s analysis. While Mr. Bezant makes too little of the available financial records, the Respondent\u2019s experts rely too heavily, and uncritically, on the financial statements of Ukrtatnafta, without factoring in any potential inaccuracy or incompleteness. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Ukrtatnafta\u2019s financial statements should be approached with some caution instead of being taken at face value.995 The Tribunal finds that enough doubt about these financial statements has been introduced by the Claimant itself in view of its responsibility in the management of the company during the relevant period, which was far from satisfactory.\n\nTranscript (22 March 2013), 237:15-20.\n\n602.\n\nWhile the Tribunal believes that Ukrtatnafta\u2019s financial records do provide some indication of the financial situation of the company (indicating, as noted above, whether it was a profitmaking or loss-making business), it would hesitate to opt for any valuation method that entirely depends on the accuracy of these statements. The Tribunal therefore shares Mr. Bezant\u2019s view that the DCF methodology is unsuitable in the present case, as it is too reliant on the financial statements of Ukrtatnafta.\n\n603.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the DCF methodology ultimately does not form the primary basis of Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s valuation. As for the methodology supporting the valuation actually employed\u2014that of valuing Ukrtatnafta somewhere in between its \"net salvage value after closure\" and the reconfiguration of the operation to improve its profitability996\u2014the Tribunal is not convinced about the accuracy of the estimate given to the salvage value of the Kremenchug Refinery. While recognizing that Mr. Waguespack and one of his colleagues visited the Kremenchug Refinery to conduct an independent evaluation of the condition of the refinery equipment,997 the Tribunal also notes that Mr. Waguespack had limited access to the physical premises and equipment of the Kremenchug Refinery, as well as to other non-public documentation that would have aided its valuation.998 For example, Mr. Waguespack conceded that in addition to \"the physical viewing of the facilities, and how they operate, we would have preferred to see more and we asked to see more.\"999\n\nFirst Baker & O\u2019Brien Report, \u00b6 1.26.\n\nTranscript (22 March 2013), 157:16-23.\n\nTranscript (22 March 2013), 157:6 to 159:14. See also Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 129 to 132.\n\nTranscript (22 March 2013), 159:7-14.\n\n604.\n\nA limited site inspection might not be in itself a problematic factor. However, if the condition of the technical installations of the Refinery itself is supposed to form the basis of the valuation, an in-depth inspection is called for. In the absence of such an in-depth inspection, the Tribunal must conclude that Baker & O\u2019Brien made a less than fully informed estimate of the salvage value of the Kremenchug Refinery.\n\n605.\n\nAs regards the quantification of the net salvage value of the Kremenchug Refinery at approximately 2% of its replacement cost new, and at 5-10% of its replacement cost new in a \"reconfiguration scenario\", the Tribunal refers to the explanation of Mr. Waguespack that the valuation of a refinery is based not only on financial documents but also on judgment and experience, as valuation experts may not always receive all the information they think necessary in order to carry out a valuation.1000 The Tribunal acknowledges that uncertainty is a constant in any valuation exercise and that the outstanding experience of Baker & O\u2019Brien in the refining industry entitles it to use its professional judgment on these matters. However, the Tribunal also believes that it cannot rely solely on the professional judgment and experience of the Respondent\u2019s experts, without substantial other evidence in support, to quantify the Claimant\u2019s damages.\n\nTranscript (22 March 2013), 187:23 to 189:8.\n\n606.\n\nA last comment on the different methodologies is appropriate. The Tribunal finds that the calculation of the equity value of Ukrtatnafta \u2014 namely, the market value of the Kremenchug refinery plus the total tangible assets, exclusive of the book value of refinery and related assets, intangible assets, and deferred tax assets of US$ 60-70 million \u2014 is compromised by the limited reliability of the financial statements in this case. The Tribunal cannot ignore the fact, however, that such limited reliability is as noted in good measure the making of the Claimant itself and accordingly should not exculpate the Claimant from the more limited compensation the Tribunal shall award.\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n-------------------------\n\n607.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that any of the methodologies that the Parties\u2019 experts propose result in an accurate calculation of the value of the Claimant\u2019s direct and indirect shareholding in Ukrtatnafta as of the agreed valuation dates. The factual uncertainty in the present case is so great that none of these methods, which all depend on different inputs of reliable data, can be deployed effectively.\n\n608.\n\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the Tribunal must base its valuation on the best available evidence. Such an approach is corroborated by commentators1001 and well established in the case law of international tribunals1002, including the Iran-US Claims Tribunal.1003 While many aspects of the financial and economic situation of Ukrtatnafta remain unclear, there are nonetheless some \"hard facts\" that provide appropriate direction in respect of the value of Ukrtatnafta. The Tribunal attaches particular importance to the transactions through which the Claimant purchased its shares in Ukrtatnafta. Neither side has questioned the fact that these transactions took place or the amounts involved. In the absence of better evidence, the Tribunal thus takes guidance from the Claimant\u2019s own contemporaneous estimate of what Ukrtatnafta was worth, as it is implicit in the price that the Claimant found appropriate to pay for Ukrtatnafta shares.\n\nAs explained by Sergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams, \"[i]n circumstances in which the precise calculation is difficult or impossible, for example due to inconclusive evidence, tribunals may exercise discretion and resort to \u2018approximations\u2019. Approximations are based on arbitrators\u2019 collective sense of what is reasonable and equitable in the circumstances of the case. One should also appreciate that an approximation can serve to reconcile disagreements between arbitrators.\" (Damages IN INTERNATIONAL Investment Law 121 (2008).\n\n*Compania De Aguas Del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.

As a result, the Claimant will essentially be reimbursed for what it has paid. This approach, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, most fairly and accurately reflects the value that was lost to the Claimant on account of the Respondent\u2019s breach of the BIT.\n\n610.\n\nSpecifically, in 2000, the Claimant paid US$ 31 million for 8,613% of Ukrtatnafta\u2019s shares.1004 The Claimant also acquired 49% of AmRuz for US$ 23,940,000 on 18 December 20071005 and 100% of Seagroup for US$ 57,120,000 on 24 December 2007.1006 Through the December 2007 transactions, the Claimant paid US$ 81,060,000 million for the acquisition of the Ukrtatnafta shares of Seagroup and AmRuz. The Tribunal observes that this results in roughly US$ 112 million in damages for the Claimant, excluding the necessary interest adjustments to account for the time value of money up to the date of the award.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 21; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 46; Transcript (18 March 2013), 14:19-21.\n\nShare Purchase Agreement between Osta Corporation Limited and Tatneft of 18 December 2007 (C-484).\n\nShare Purchase Agreement between Osta Corporation Limited; Seagroup International, Inc. and Tatneft of 24 December 2007 (C-485).\n\n611.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that it is entitled to any increase in value between the shareholdings as of the agreed valuation date and the date of the award. However, the Tribunal notes that it has not received adequate evidence to conclude that any such increase has in fact occurred. In relation to the amount of US$ 31 million that the Claimant paid in 2000, specifically, the Tribunal reiterates its finding that for most of the period before October 2007, when the Claimant was effectively managing Ukrtatnafta, Ukrtatnafta did not generate profits. It is thus likely that there has been no increase in the value of the Claimant\u2019s shareholding from 2000 to 2007. The Tribunal does not have before it any reliable data that would document an increase in value after 2007.\n\n612.\n\nAs regards the US$ 81,060,000 million that the Claimant paid in 2007 for the shares of AmRuz and Seagroup, the Tribunal considers that this amount represented a fair price for the Claimant, together with the other Tatarstan shareholding, to assume majority control of Ukrtatnafta.\n\n613.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these amounts are in fact not too dissimilar to the amounts paid by Privat Group in 2009 and 2010 provided that one takes into consideration the break-down offered at the hearing by Mr. Kolomoisky. Mr. Kolomoisky testified that Privat Group had paid a total of about US$ 720 million for its 55.7% stake of Ukrtatnafta, out of which only around US$ 200 million was paid in consideration of the shares themselves.1007 The remaining amount was described as a sort of \"emergency cash flow\" contribution, made to allow the company to meet its immediate payment needs. There was no suggestion by Mr. Kolomoisky that any proportion of this cash flow contribution was invested by Ukrtatnafta in ways that would ensure that its value was retained in the company.\n\nTranscript (25 March 2013), 125:5-24.\n\n614.\n\nWhile the Tribunal acknowledges that the figure of US$ 200 million, corresponding to a 55.7% equity stake, was merely an estimate by Mr. Kolomoisky, the Tribunal does consider that it confirms the plausibility of its own valuation of the Claimant\u2019s 22.7% equity stake at US$ 112 million.\n\n615.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in Ukrtatnafta are most adequately valued by reference to the Claimant\u2019s purchase price for these shareholdings. The Tribunal finds that the total value of these shareholdings amounts to US$ 112 million.\n\n616.\n\nThe Tribunal also highlights that one arbitrator takes exception to compensation at this last figure and considers that the alternative methodological valuations could not result in a figure greater than US$ 52.3 million.\n\n617.\n\nAs it has been noted above, the Claimant in its First Memorial included claims for compensation for damages arising from unpaid oil deliveries in the amount of US$ 414.4 million. As the Tribunal has already concluded above that the Respondent could not be held liable for the non-payment by Ukrtatnafta for oil deliveries, the claim for compensation in this respect shall not be considered.\n\n**C. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n618.\n\nThe Claimant requests an award of compound interest on any amounts awarded by the Tribunal in relation to the loss of its direct and indirect shareholdings and to the outstanding debt of the Respondent for oil deliveries and the Claimant\u2019s payment of tax penalty fees.\n\n619.\n\nThe Respondent objects to (a) the interest rates proposed by the Claimant, (b) the start dates for the accrual of interest proposed by the Claimant, and (c) the Claimant\u2019s request for an award of compound interest.\n\n**1. Interest Rates**\n---------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n620.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the principle of full reparation also governs payment of interest. Citing Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility1008 as well as arbitral case law,1009 the Claimant states that it is entitled to interest \"at an appropriate rate\" on the entire value of its investments in Ukrtatnafta and the sum due for oil deliveries.1010\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 545. Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides:  \n 1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.  \n 2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.  \n International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, in Report of the Commission lo the General Assembly on the Work of its Fifty-Third* Session, UN Doc.

As the Claimant explains, the rate in Article 5(2) presumes that \"prompt, adequate and effective\" compensation has been made in the event of a lawful expropriation, which is not the situation at present.1011 The Claimant also argues that the interest rate is to be set in accordance with the currency \"in which the investment was made, the harm was caused and compensation is to be awarded.\"1012\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 548.\n\n*Id,* \u00b6 549.\n\n622.\n\nWith regard to its lost investment in Ukrtatnafta, the Claimant argues that the \"investment alternative\" approach should be applied, as it has been adopted by many investment tribunals.1013 It therefore claims that the applicable interest rate should be determined using 10-year US$-denominated Ukraine bonds, 30-year US$-denominated Russian bonds in the case that the Tribunal should consider that an investment alternative in the Russian Federation would be more appropriate, or the applicable rates on US$ deposits in the Russian Federation, in the event that the Tribunal believes that government bonds are not an appropriate investment alternative.1014\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 649 n. 883, *referring to* *Sola Tiles, Inc. v.

According to the Respondent, \"to do otherwise would be to ignore the BIT carefully negotiated and agreed between Russia and Ukraine.\"1015 The interest rate specified in the BIT should prevail over any interest rates defined under customary international law or Russian law.1016\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 467- 469.\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 459-461; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 385,391-392.471-472.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n624.\n\nIt is true, as argued by the Respondent, that Article 5(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provides specifically for the interest rate to be applied in the case of expropriation.\n\n625.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal notes that no similar provision concerning interest can be found in connection with damages resulting from other breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal has already found in favor of the Claimant concerning breaches on grounds other than expropriation. The Tribunal is therefore free to define the interest rate that should apply in the present circumstances.\n\n626.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the interest rate mentioned in Article 5(2) of the BIT is restricted to circumstances of expropriation, it does not share the Claimant\u2019s view that the applicable interest rate should be established by reference to Ukrainian or Russian-bonds or to US$ deposits in the Russian Federation. The \"investment alternative\" approach mentioned by the Claimant and its reference mentioned above to a number of investment awards does not limit the Tribunal to such alternatives. The Tribunal is of the view that the parties to the BIT have indicated in Article 5(2) their preferred standard and, while the Tribunal is not bound by such standard for the reason mentioned above, it considers that reference to the LIBOR rate would be justified in the present case and notes that such standard has been regularly used in investment awards. The Tribunal is of the view however that an addition of 3% to that rate would be more appropriate than the 1% mentioned in Article 5(2) of the BIT and more in line with what is generally awarded.\n\n627.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides that the interest rate to be paid by the Respondent shall be the interest rate for three months\u2019 deposits in US dollars at the London interbank market rate (LIBOR) plus 3%.\n\n**2. Starting Date for the Accrual of Interest**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nWith regard to its lost investment in Ukrtatnafta, the Claimant argues that 27 January 2010 and 12 May 2009 should be the starting dates for the accrual of interest for its loss of direct and indirect shareholdings, respectively.1017\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 554.\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n629.\n\nThe Respondent submits that interest should accrue from the date of the Award, which is the date \"when the amount of the sum due has been fixed and the obligation to pay has been established.\"1018\n\nSecond Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 462 n. 869, *referring to S.S. \"Wimbledon\", (UK* v. *Japan),* Judgment, 1923 PCIJ (Ser. A) No. 1.17 August 1923, \u00b6 56 (RLA-128).\n\n630.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees that 27 January 2010 and 12 May 2009\u2014the agreed valuation dates\u2014should also be used to determine the accrual of interest in respect of the Claimant\u2019s claim for direct damages, asserting that this proposal \"is misguided and ignores established arbitral practice.\"1019\n\nAZ, \u00b6 463.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that the interest shall run from the taking of the shares. The Tribunal recalls that there is consensus between the Parties that the taking of these shares occurred on two dates \u2014 namely, 12 May 2009 for the 14.09% indirect shareholding of Tatneft in Ukrtatnafta, which it held through AmRuz and Seagroup, and 27 January 2010, for Tatneft\u2019s 8.61% direct shareholding in Ukrtatnafta. The Tribunal therefore holds that interest shall begin to accrue on the amount of US$ 68.44 million on 12 May 2009, and on the amount of US$ 43.56 million on 27 January 2010.\n\n632.\n\nTo better enable the Respondent to make full payment, the Tribunal decides that the accrual of interest shall be suspended from the date of the issuance of the Award to sixty (60) days thereafter.\n\n**3. Compound Interest**\n------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n633.\n\nThe Claimant states that it is the \"norm\" in investment arbitration to order compound interest, and requests the Tribunal do so here.1020\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 559. *See also* Transcript (18 March 2013), 149:11 to 150:24.\n\n634.\n\nRelying on a significant number of investor-state cases,1021 the Claimant argues that \"[i]t is [...] well established that a tribunal may order compound interest to ensure full reparation.\"1022 In particular, the Claimant refers to *Santa Elena* v. *Costa Rica,* where the tribunal stated that \"the amount of compensation should reflect the additional sum that the money would have earned if [it] had been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.\"1023 The Claimant also refers to *Wena Hotels,* where the tribunal confirmed that compound interest was required in order to give the claimant full reparation.1024\n\nSecond Memorial, \u00b6 559 n. 896, *referring io* *Waguih Elie Siag and Clorinda Vecchi* v. *The Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case ARB/05/15, Award of 1 June 2009, \u00b6 595 (CLA-191) (\"The Tribunal has no hesitation in ruling that interest should run from the date of the expropriation, and that it should be compounded.
