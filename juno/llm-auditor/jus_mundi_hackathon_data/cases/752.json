Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 26, 2001, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) received from CMS Gas Transmission Company (CMS), an entity incorporated in the United States of America, a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Argentina (Argentina). The request concerns the alleged suspension by Argentina of a tariff adjustment formula for gas transportation applicable to an enterprise in which CMS has an investment. In its request, the Claimant invokes the provisions of the 1991 \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment.\" (The Argentina-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty or BIT).1\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment. November 14, 1991, in force from October 20, 1994. Hereinafter cited as the U.S.-Argentina BIT.\n\n2.\n\nOn July 27, 2001, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the request to Argentina and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n3.\n\nOn August 15, 2001, the Centre requested CMS to confirm that the dispute referred to in the request had not been submitted by CMS for resolution in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed, dispute-settlement procedure under Article VII(2)(b) of the BIT. On August 23, 2001, CMS confirmed that it had taken no such steps.\n\n4.\n\nOn August 24, 2001, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention (the Convention). On this same date, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n5.\n\nOn August 30, 2001, the Centre reminded Argentina of the Claimant's proposal concerning the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. Under this proposal, contained in paragraph 60 of the request for arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third, who would be President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 13, 2001, Argentina informed the Centre of its agreement to the proposal of CMS concerning the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. On the same date the Centre informed the parties that since their agreement on the number of arbitrators and method of their appointment was equivalent to the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention, the parties were invited to follow the procedure set forth in Arbitration Rule 3 for the appointment of arbitrators.\n\n7.\n\nOn October 24, 2001 Argentina appointed Judge Francisco Rezek, a national of Brazil, as an arbitrator. On November 9, 2001, CMS appointed the Honorable Marc Lalonde P.C., O.C., Q.C., a national of Canada, as an arbitrator. The parties, however, failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding, arbitrator. In these circumstances, by letter of December 5, 2001, the Claimant requested that the third, presiding, arbitrator be appointed in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.2\n\nUnder Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, if the Tribunal is not yet constituted within 90 days after the notice of registration of the request has been dispatched, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council shall, at the request of either party, and after consulting both parties as far as possible, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed and designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nAfter consultation with the parties, Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a national of Chile, was duly appointed as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On January 11, 2002, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules) notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Alejandro Escobar, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held on February 4, 2002, at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. At the session the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the course of the first session the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. The Tribunal, after ascertaining the views of the parties on this matter, fixed the following time limits for the written phase of the proceedings: The Claimant would file a memorial within 120 days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a counter-memorial within 120 days of its receipt of the Claimant's memorial; the Claimant would file a reply within 60 days from its receipt of the counter-memorial; and the respondent would file its rejoinder within 60 days of its receipt of the reply. At the first session it was further agreed that in the event of the Respondent raising objections to jurisdiction, the following time limits would apply: the Respondent would file its reply on jurisdiction within 30 days from its receipt of the Claimant's counter-memorial on jurisdiction; and the Claimant would file its rejoinder on jurisdiction within 30 days from its receipt of the Respondent's reply on jurisdiction.\n\n11.\n\nOn 24 May 2002, the Claimant requested an extension till July 5, 2002 of the time limited fixed for the fixing of its memorial. On June 6, 2002, the Tribunal granted the extension thought by the Claimant. In doing so, the Tribunal noted that Argentina would be entitled to an equivalent extension if requested, of the time limit fixed for its counter-memorial.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 5, 2002, the Claimant filed its memorial on the merits and accompanying documentation. On August 5, 2002, Mrs. Margrete L. Stevens replaced Mr. Alejandro Escobar as Secretary of the Tribunal. On September 4, 2002, Argentina requested an extension till October 7, 2002, of the time limit fixed for filing of the memorial on jurisdiction. On September 11, 2002, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by Argentina. On October 7, 2002, Argentina filed its memorial on jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nOn October 24, 2002, following the Respondent's filing of objections to jurisdiction, the proceeding on the merits was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n14.\n\nOn December 17, 2002, the Claimant submitted its counter-memorial on jurisdiction. On January 22, 2003, the parties requested an extension of 30 days for each of the remaining two jurisdictional filings. On January 27, 2003, the Tribunal granted the extensions, and fixed the time limit for the filing of the Respondents reply on jurisdiction for February 11, 2003; and the time limit for the filing of the Claimant's rejoinder on jurisdiction for March 25, 2003.\n\n15.\n\nOn February 13, 2003, the Respondent filed its reply on jurisdiction, and on March 25, 2003, the Claimant filed its rejoinder on jurisdiction.\n\n16.\n\nOn April 7-8, 2003, the hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Ms. Lucy Reed and Messrs. Nigel Blackaby, Jonathan Sutcliffe and Guido Tawil addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. Mr. Ignacio Suarez Anzorena addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Argentina. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated and considered thoroughly the parties' written submissions on the question of jurisdiction and the oral arguments delivered in the course of the April 7-8, 2003 hearing. As mentioned above, the consideration of the merits has been postponed until the issue of the Centre's jurisdiction and the Tribunal's competence has been decided by the Tribunal. Having considered the basic facts of the dispute, the ICSID Convention and the 1991 Argentina-U.S. BIT, as well as the written and oral arguments of the parties' representatives, the Tribunal has reached the following decision on the question of jurisdiction.\n\n**B. Considerations Argentina's privatization program**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nBeginning in 1989, the Republic of Argentina undertook a broad program of privatization of State-owned companies and other activities,3 while at the same time it proceeded to peg the Argentine peso to the United States dollar and adopted other stabilization measures.4 Important aims of this program were to achieve currency stability, eliminate inflation and attract foreign investment.\n\nLaw No. 23,696 of 1989 on the Reform of the State.\n\nLaw No. 23,928 of 1991 on Convertibility.\n\n19.\n\nOne major sector subject to privatization was the gas industry. The Gas Law,5 the Gas Decree,6 the 1992 Information Memorandum,7 the Model License8 and other instruments were prepared and enacted in order to undertake the reorganization of this important sector of the economy. Within this overall legal framework, Transportadora de Gas del Norte (TGN), an Argentine incorporated company, obtained in 1992 a license for the transportation of gas while blocks of State-owned shares in the company were sold to private investors. Following another Public Offering made in 1995, CMS purchased the shares still remaining in government hands that represented 25% of TGN, and later purchased an additional 4.42% that had been assigned to an employee share program, thus totaling 29.42% of TGN.\n\nLaw 24,076 of 1992 on the Privatisation of the Gas Sector.\n\nDecree 1738/92 of 1992 on the implementation of the Gas Law.\n\nInformation Memorandum on the Initial Public Tender Offer, 1992.\n\nDecree 2255/92 of 1992 on the terms and conditions of licenses.\n\n20.\n\nUnder the arrangements made for the privatization of this sector, tariffs were to be calculated in U.S. dollars and expressed in pesos at the exchange rate at the time of billing, and there were also to be adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the United States Producer Price Index (\"PPI\"). Following a major economic and financial crisis, the Republic of Argentina enacted, starting late 1999, various measures which had, in the Claimant's view, an adverse impact on its business and breached the guarantees which protected its investment in TGN. These measures later led to the devaluation of the currency and the adoption of additional financial and administrative measures also alleged to have an adverse impact on the investor.9\n\nLaw No. 25,561 of 2002 on Public Emergency and Reform of the Currency Exchange Regime, Decree 71/2002 on Public Emergency and Decree 214/2002 on \"pesification\".\n\n21.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina does not share those views and believes the measures adopted have a meaning and extent different from what CMS claims. Moreover, the Republic of Argentina explains that many of these measures are transitory in nature, are currently being subject to renegotiation with investors in the privatization program and do not entail an expropriation of the investment made. The only guarantees made to CMS by the Republic of Argentina, it is further affirmed, were those established in the Terms of the License and these have not been breached.\n\n**Nature and limits of the jurisdictional decision**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe dispute between the parties has been submitted to arbitration under the ICSID Convention pursuant to the Argentina-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty.10 Although many of the views expressed by the parties concern aspects relating to the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal has at this stage to decide only on aspects of jurisdiction. The discussion which follows relates of course only to the issues and facts pertinent to this particular case.\n\n*See supra*, note 1.\n\n**Measures of public interest and industry-specific measures distinguished**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nBoth in the written pleadings and in the hearing, the Republic of Argentina raised, in connection with questions of admissibility, the concern that part of the claim by CMS is not related specifically to the gas industry but to measures of general economic policy affecting the country as a whole. The latter measures, it is further explained, are mainly those connected with the situation of economic, financial and social emergency which arose in late 2001 and early 2002 and which led to the adoption of changes in the exchange and monetary policy then in effect.\n\n24.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina specifically discusses in its presentations Decree 1570/01 dated December 1, 200111 and Law 25,561 of January 6, 2002, related to the public emergency and amendment of the exchanged system.12 This legislation brought to an end the regime of convertibility and parity of the Argentine peso with the United States dollar which had been enacted by Law 23,928 in effect since 1991.13 Most of the foreign and domestic investments in the public utilities sector were made under that regime in the 1990's. The new legislation also mandated the restructuring and renegotiation of public and private contracts made in foreign currency, extinguished the right of the licensees in the regulated public sector to link tariffs to U.S. price indices and redenominated rates and tariffs into pesos at the exchange rate of one peso per dollar. A process of renegotiation which is still under way followed the \"pesification\" and related measures. The Claimant believes that all such measures are not separate and distinct from the original dispute and form a single continuum. According to the Claimant, the aggregate of measures has significantly affected the value of its investment, a view which is disputed by the Republic of Argentina.\n\nDecree 1570/2001, December 1, 2001 on Financial Entities.\n\n*Supra*, note 9.\n\n*Supra*, note 4.\n\n25.\n\nAlthough a good part of the views of the parties relating to those earlier measures and to others which followed has much to do with the merits of the case, the Tribunal believes that it is necessary to establish at the outset a clear distinction between measures of a general economic nature, particularly in the context of the economic and financial emergency discussed above, and measures specifically directed to the investment's operation.\n\n26.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and the jurisdiction of the tribunal established under it were conceived as a system of adjudication of legal disputes arising directly out of an investment, a premise that is specifically included in Article 25(1) of that Convention. This definition excludes quite clearly two kinds of disputes. First, it excludes nonlegal questions and, second, it excludes disputes that do not arise directly out of the investment concerned.\n\n27.\n\nIt follows that, in this context, questions of general economic policy not directly related to the investment, as opposed to measures specifically addressed to the operations of the business concerned, will normally fall outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. A direct relationship can, however, be established if those general measures are adopted in violation of specific commitments given to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts. What is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre is not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments.\n\n28.\n\nThe question is certainly not new in international law.14 Gold standards or reference currencies embodied in financial transactions, stabilization clauses built into contracts and, more recently, the vast network of bilateral investment treaties are all expressions of the search for stability and legal certainty. The right of the host State to adopt its economic policies together with the rights of investors under a system of guarantees and protection are at the very heart of this difficult balance, a balance which the Convention was careful to preserve.\n\nJ. Sulkowski: \"Questions Juridiques soulev\u00e9es dans les Rapports Internationaux par les Variations de Valeur des Signes Mon\u00e9taires\", *Recueil des Cours de l' Acad\u00e9mie de Droit International*, Vol. 29, 1929. 5 and ff.\n\n29.\n\nIn an early case an ICSID tribunal held that \"Bilateral Investment Treaties are not insurance policies against bad business judgments.\"15 Similarly, these treaties cannot entirely isolate foreign investments from the general economic situation of a country. They do provide for standards of fair and equitable treatment, non-discrimination, guarantees in respect of expropriation and other matters, but they cannot prevent a country from pursuing its own economic choices. These choices are not under the Centre's jurisdiction and ICSID tribunals cannot pass judgment on whether such polices are right or wrong. Judgment cannot only be made in respect of whether the rights of investors have been violated.\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Award of November 13, 2000, par. 64.\n\n30.\n\nThe parties in this case appear not to disagree with this reasoning. The Republic of Argentina, in arguing about the difference between what it considers to be two separate kinds of disputes, emphasizes that general measures of public economic emergency are not directed towards investors but affect the country and its population as a whole. More importantly, the Claimant in justifying its claim for compensation in connection with the \"pesification\" has also stated:\n\n\"It should be noted, however, that CMS's compensation is not founded on the devaluation of the peso, but rather on the loss in value of its investment due to Argentina's dismantling of the dollar-based tariff regime.\"16\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, at 18, par. 50.\n\n31.\n\nAt the oral hearing held in this case, Counsel for the Claimant, when referring to this distinction between general and specific measures also stated that:\n\n\"CMS assumes that such distinction could be made. (...) However, CMS is by no means complaining about general economic measures, but about specific measures of Argentine federal authorities that breached the commitments made towards CMS under the Treaty and international law.\"17\n\nHearing, April 8, 2003, at 84.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimant has also explained that it is not currently pursuing an earlier claim against Argentina related to restrictions on the transfer of funds introduced by Decree 1570/0118 because such restrictions \"have not had a material impact on CMS or its investments to date,\"19 and has reserved the right to pursue that claim if damages are caused in the future in violation of Article V of the BIT. In the statements and decisions noted the Claimant separates the general measures of economic policy, with specific reference to devaluation, from the material impact they might have had on its investment in light of the treaty, legislation and contracts.\n\n*Supra*, note 11.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, at 50, note 118.\n\n33.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations the Tribunal concludes on this point that it does not have jurisdiction over measures of general economic policy adopted by the Republic of Argentina and cannot pass judgment on whether they are right or wrong. The Tribunal also concludes, however, that it has jurisdiction to examine whether specific measures affecting the Claimant's investment or measures of general economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments made to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts.\n\n34.\n\nWhile conceptually the line between one and the other matter is clear, in practice whether a given claim falls under one or the other heading can only be established in light of the evidence which the parties will produce and address in connection with the merits phase of the case. Counsel for the Republic fo Argentina has rightly explained that the distinction made \"may have great relevance with regard to liability or responsibility.\"20 This means in fact that the issue of what falls within or outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction will be subsumed in the determination of whether a given claim is or is not directly connected with specific measures affecting the investment.\n\nHearing, April 8, 2003, at 40.\n\n35.\n\nFor the time being, the fact that the Claimant has demonstrated *prima facie* that it has been adversely affected by measures adopted by the Republic of Argentina is sufficient for the Tribunal to consider that the claim, as far as this matter is concerned, is admissible and that it has jurisdiction to examine it on the merits.\n\n**Objection to admissibility on the issue of the Claimant's** ***jus standi***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has objected to the admissibility of the claim by CMS on the ground that the Claimant does not hold the rights upon which it bases its claim & to wit, TGN being the licensee, and CMS only a minority shareholder in this company, only TGN could claim for any damage suffered. It is further argued that, since TGN is an Argentine company, it does not qualify as a foreign investor under the BIT nor is the License a foreign investment. It follows, in the Respondent's view, that CMS is claiming not for direct damages but for indirect damages which could result from its minority participation in TGN.\n\n37.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has also advanced the view that, in addition, CMS cannot claim for its proportional share in TGN, as this would imply that the shareholders have a standing different from that of the company. If TGN arrives at an agreement with the Republic of Argentina, it is further stated, CMS could only oppose such arrangement as an intra-corporate question and not as the holder of an independent right of action.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the only guarantee the Republic of Argentina gave to CMS related to the legal quality of the shares which were transferred to the Claimant by the Republic of Argentina in the context of the privatization process. Should that legal quality be proven defective, CMS would have *jus standi* to claim for reparation, but this is not the case as the claim concerns the operation of the License and not the shares themselves.\n\n39.\n\nCMS has opposed such arguments on the premise that both the BIT and the whole process of investing in TGN was related to the privatization of the gas industry in Argentina, a process which was the subject of specific guarantees and commitments by the Republic of Argentina. These guarantees included measures of legal stability and economic mechanisms aimed at ensuring the financial feasibility and the success of the investment, not just the question of the quality of the shares.\n\n40.\n\nIn this regard, it is also explained, CMS is not claiming for rights pertaining to TGN but for the rights associated with its investment in the company. It is further stated that CMS qualifies as a foreign investor under the BIT and its participation as a shareholder is a foreign investment protected under that Treaty, thus having a right of action independently from TGN. This right of action, it is argued, arises directly from the BIT provisions and it is independent from any contractual right of action that TGN might have under the License. International law and not any domestic law which might relate to contracts or other transactions governs such rights of claim, it is further stated. The claims being asserted under the BIT, it is also explained, are direct and not indirect.\n\n41.\n\nThe arguments that the parties have put forth involve a number of questions of admissibility and jurisdiction. The distinction between admissibility and jurisdiction does not appear quite appropriate in the context of ICSID as the Convention deals only with jurisdiction and competence. In any event, the Tribunal will follow the order of the arguments introduced in respect of one and other concept so as to facilitate their discussion. First, there is the issue of whether a shareholder can claim for its rights in a foreign company independently from the latter's rights and, if so, whether these rights refer only to its status as shareholder or also to substantive rights connected with the legal and economic performance of its investment. Second, there is the question of whether the Claimant satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of the Convention and the BIT, particularly those concerning the existence of a legal dispute, whether this dispute arises directly from the investment, and the nationality of the investor. The Tribunal will address these questions next.\n\n**Corporate personality in Argentine legislation**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has raised as a first bar to the claim by minority shareholders the legal provision in effect in that country, as in most civil and common law countries, to the effect that the corporate legal personality is distinct and separate from that of the shareholders. Distinguished Argentine jurists have been invoked to this effect.21 However true this legal distinction is, the fact is that it is not determinant in this case. First, as will be discussed further below, the applicable jurisdictional provisions are only those of the Convention and the BIT, not those which might arise from national legislation. But even if the Argentine legislation were relevant, it is also worth noting that that legislation has contributed significantly to the piercing of the corporate veil when the real interests behind the corporate personality need to be identified as evidenced for example by Article 54, par. 3, of Law 19,550, as amended by Law 22,903.22\n\nCarlos Su\u00e1rez Anzorena: \"Personalidad de las Sociedades\", *Cuadernos de Derecho Societario*, 1973, as cited in the Memorial on Jurisdiction, note 82.\n\nLaw no. 19,550 of 1972 on Commercial Corporations, Article 52, par. 3.\n\n**Shareholder rights under general international law**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe parties have turned next to the discussion of the situation under international law, with particular reference to the meaning and extent of the *Barcelona Traction* decision.23 Counsel for the Republic of Argentina are right when arguing that that decision ruled out the protection of investors by the State of their nationality when that State is different from the State of incorporation of the corporate entity concerned, all of it in respect of damage suffered in a third State. However, Counsel for the Claimant are also right when affirming that this case was concerned only with the exercise of diplomatic protection in that particular triangular setting, and involved what the Court considered to be a relationship attached to municipal law, but it did not rule out the possibility of extending protection to shareholders in a corporation in different contexts. Specifically, the International Court of Justice was well aware of the new trends in respect of the protection of foreign investors under the 1965 Convention and the bilateral investment treaties related thereto.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co. Ltd. (Belgium v. Spain)*, Judgment of February 5, 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, 3.\n\n44.\n\n*Barcelona Traction* is therefore not directly relevant to the present dispute, although it marks the beginning of a fundamental change of the applicable concepts under international law and State practice. In point of fact, the *Elettronica Sicula* decision evidences that the International Court of Justice itself accepted, some years later, the protection of shareholders of a corporation by the State of their nationality in spite of the fact that the affected corporation had a corporate personality under the defendant State's legislation.24\n\nCase Concerning the *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*, Judgment of July 20, 1989, ICJ Reports 1989, 15.\n\n45.\n\nDiplomatic protection itself has been dwindling in current international law, as the State of nationality is no longer considered to be protecting its own interest in the claim but that of the individual affected.25 To some extent, diplomatic protection is intervening as a residual mechanism to be resorted to in the absence of other arrangements recognizing the direct right of action by individuals. It is precisely this kind of arrangement that has come to prevail under international law, particularly in respect of foreign investments, the paramount example being that of the 1965 Convention.\n\nInternational Law Commission: Preliminary Report on Diplomatic Protection, by Mohammed Bennouna, Special Rapporteur, A/CN.4/484, 4 February 1998, at 5.\n\n46.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has advanced the argument that, when shareholders have been protected separately from the affected corporation, this occurred in cases where the shareholders were majority or controlling, not minority shareholders as in the instant case. This fact may be true, but it is equally true, as argued by the Claimant, question of controlling majorities; rather they were concerned with the possibility of protecting shareholders independently from the affected corporation, that is, solely with the issue of the corporate legal personality and its limits.\n\n47.\n\nState practice further supports the meaning of this changing scenario. Besides accepting the protection of shareholders and other forms of participation in corporations and partnerships, the concept of limiting it to majority or controlling participations has given way to a lower threshold in this respect. Minority and non-controlling participations have thus been included in the protection granted or have been admitted to claim in their own right. Contemporary practice relating to lump-sum agreements,26 the decisions of the Iran-United States Tribunal27 and the rules and decisions of the United Nations Compensation Commission,28 among other examples, evidence increasing flexibility in the handling of international claims.\n\nDavid J. Bederman: \"Interim Report on Lump Sum Agreements and Diplomatic Protection\", International Law Association, Committee on Diplomatic Protection of Persons and Property, *Report of the Seventieth Conference*, New Delhi, 2002, 230, at 253-256.\n\nFor the jurisprudence of the Untied States-Iran Claims Tribunal *see* generally George H. Aldrich: *The Jurisprudence of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal*, 1996; Charles N. Brower and Jason D. Brueschke: *The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal*, 1998.\n\nUnited Nations Compensation Commission, Decision of the Governing Council on Business Losses of Individuals, S/AC.26/1191/4, 23 October 1991, par. F, and Decision 123 (2001).\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds no bar in current international law to the concept of allowing claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned, not even if those shareholders are minority or non-controlling shareholders. Although it is true, as argued by the Republic of Argentina, that this is mostly the result of **lex specialis** and specific treaty arrangements that have so allowed, the fact is that **lex specialis** in this respect is so prevalent that it can now be considered the general rule, certainly in respect of foreign investments and increasingly in respect of other matters.29 To the extent that customary international law or generally the traditional law of international claims might have followed a different approach & a proposition that is open to debate & then that approach can be considered the exception.\n\nInternational Law Association, Committee on Diplomatic Protection of Persons and Property, First Report, *Sixty-Ninth Conference*, London, 2000.\n\n**Shareholder rights under the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nAs mentioned above, the 1965 Convention is the paramount example of the approach now prevailing in international law in respect of claims arising from foreign investments. It is a well-known fact that Article 25(1) of that Convention did not attempt to define the term \"investment\", as no definition was generally acceptable. Against this background, all relevant bilateral investment treaties and other instruments embodying the consent of the parties to ICSID's jurisdiction have usually contained definition in this respect.30\n\n*Fedax v. Venezuela*, Decision of the ICSID Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, July 11, 1997, pars. 21-26 with citations to the relevant cases and literature.\n\n50.\n\nA rather broad interpretation of \"investment\" has ensued from these expressions of consent. It should be recalled that the ownership of shares was one of the specific examples of investment given during the negotiations of the Convention as pertinent for parties to agree in the context of their expressions of consent to jurisdiction.31 The definition of investment in the Argentina-United States BIT will be considered further below.\n\n*Ibid.*, par. 22, note 18.\n\n51.\n\nPrecisely because the Convention does not define \"investment\", it does not purport to define the requirements that an investment should meet to qualify for ICSID jurisdiction. There is indeed no requirement that an investment, in order to qualify, must necessarily be made by shareholders controlling a company or owning the majority of its shares. It is well known incidentally that, depending on how shares are distributed, controlling shareholders can in fact own less than the majority of shares. The reference that Article 25(2)(b) makes to foreign control in terms of treating a company of the nationality of the Contracting State party as a national of another Contracting State is precisely meant to facilitate agreement between the parties, so as not to have the corporate personality interfering with the protection of the real interests associated with the investment. The same result can be achieved by means of the provisions of the BIT, where the consent may include non-controlling or minority shareholders.\n\n52.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the Convention is also relevant in another respect. In the *Fedax* case, Venezuela had objected to ICSID's jurisdiction on the ground that the dispute transaction was not a \"direct foreign investment.\" Although the transaction considered in that case was different from the one in the present case, the tribunal's holding is useful in the interpretation of the scope of that Article:\n\n\"However, the text of Article 25(1) establishes that the 'jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment.' It is apparent that the term 'directly' relates in this Article to the 'dispute' and not the 'investment'. It follows that jurisdiction can exist even in respect of investments that are not direct, so long as the dsipute arises directly from such transaction. This interpretation is also consistent with the broad reach that the term 'investment' must be given in light of the negotiating history of the Convention.\"32\n\n*Ibid.*, par. 24\n\n53.\n\nWith this background in mind, it is then possible for this Tribunal to examine the meaning of a number of decisions of ICSID tribunals that have dealt with the protection of shareholders. The parties have a different reading of these ICSID cases, with particular reference to *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*,33*AMT v. Zaire*,34*Antoine Goetz et consorts v. Republique du Burundi*,35*Maffezini v. Spain*,36*Lanco v. Argentina*,37*Genin v. Estonia*,38 the *Aguas* or *Vivendi* Award39 and Annulment40 and *CME v. Czech Republic*.41 For the Republic of Argentina, all these cases deal with shareholder rights, underlying arrangements and factual situations different from those given in the instant case, and hence do not support jurisdiction in this case. CMS, for its part, believes that, to the contrary, in all those cases the right of shareholders, including minority shareholders, to claim independently from the corporate entity affect has been upheld.\n\n*AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, ICSID Award of June 27, 1990.\n\n*AMT v. Zaire*, ICSID Award of February 21, 1997.\n\n*Antoine Goetz et consorts v. R\u00e9publique du Burundi*, Sentence du CIRDI du 10 F\u00e9vrier 1999.\n\n*Supra*, note 15.\n\n*Lanco v. Argentina*, Preliminary Decision of the ICSID Tribunal of December 8, 1998.\n\n*Genin et al. v. Estonia*, ICSID Award of June 25, 2001.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija et al. v. Argentina*, ICSID Award of November 21, 2000.\n\n*Vivendi*, ICSID Annulment Decision of July 3, 2002.\n\n*CME v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award of September 13, 2001.\n\n54.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the factual setting of each case is different and that some may lend themselves more than others to illustrate points of relevance. In some cases, there has been majority shareholding or control by the investor, in others not; in some cases there has been expropriation affecting specifically the shares, in others not; in some cases, there has been no objection to jurisdiction, in others there has been.\n\n55.\n\nHowever, there can be no doubt that most, if not all, such cases are immersed in the same trend discussed above in the context of international law and the meaning of the 1965 Convention. In the present case, the Claimant has convincingly explained that notwithstanding the variety of situations in ICSID's jurisprudence noted by the Republic of Argentina, the tribunals have in all such cases been concerned not with the question of majority or control but rather whether shareholders can claim independently from the corporate entity. In *Goetz* the tribunal reflected this prevailing trend in the following terms:\n\n\u00ab... le Tribunal observe que la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure du CIRDI ne limite pas la qualit\u00e9 pour agir aux seules personnes morales directement vis\u00e9es par les mesures litigieuses mais l'\u00e9tend aux actionnaires de ces personnes, qui sont les v\u00e9ritables investisseurs.\u00bb42\n\n*Supra*, note 35, par. 89.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal can therefore conclude that there is no bar to the exercise of jurisdiction in light of the 1965 Convention and its interpretation as reflected in its drafting history, the opinion of distinguished legal writers and the jurisprudence of ICSID tribunals.\n\n**Shareholder rights under the Argentina-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal turns next to the examination of the definition of \"investment\" in the Argentina-United States BIT. Article I(1) of this Treaty provides as pertinent:\n\n\"(a) 'investment' means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n(...)\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof...\"\n\n58.\n\nHere again the parties have a different reading of that Article. The Republic of Argentina is of the view that, since Article 25 of the Convention requires the control of a local subsidiary in order to qualify as a claimant, the fact that the BIT does not make such a requirement is immaterial since the Convention has to prevail. The Tribunal concluded above that the Convention does not really make such a requirement a central tenet of jurisdiction but only an alternative for very specific purposes. In any event, the provision of the Treaty is not in any way incompatible with Article 25 of the Convention.\n\n59.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has also asserted that an investment in shares is indeed a protected investment under the Treaty, but this would only allow claims for measures affecting the shares as such, for example, expropriation of the shares or interference with the political and economic rights tied to those shares. Such interpretation would not allow, however, for claims connected to damage suffered by the corporate entity. If a claim for indirect damage has been allowed, it is further argued, this would have been stated expressly in the Treaty, as has been in other bilateral investment treaties, including some signed by Argentina, or in the context of trade arrangements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or other instruments. Silence on this point the Respondent argues, cannot be construed as an expression of consent to such type of claims.\n\n60.\n\nCMS's understanding is different. In its view, the plain language of the provisions and their legal context can only mean that investment in shares is a protected investment and that the investor has, under the Treaty, the right for its investment independently from any claims that the company in which it has invested might have. Again here, it is a question of seeking to identify the real economic interests between such transactions. It is argued, in addition, that it was Argentina that required the licensees of the privatization of the gas industry to be local companies. The protection granted by investment treaties was expressly mentioned in these invitations. If shareholders were not left out of such substantive protection, it is further explained, this would render the treaties meaningless.\n\n61.\n\nThe parties have debated the meaning of the decisions of other ICSID tribunals on this question. Again, it is evident that the factual and legal background of each such decision is different. Counsel for the Republic of Argentina have rightly explained that, in some cases, there has been a treaty authorizing indirect claims by the investor, in others there has been an expropriation of a license of the claimant or of the shares held by it, while in yet other cases claimants have been controlling or majority shareholders and thus their claim becomes a direct one.\n\n62.\n\nCounsel for CMS have also explained that while in some cases there have been controlling shareholders and in others not, the relevant fact is that, in all cases, jurisdiction has been accepted on the basis that shareholders have a protected right of their own arising from their investment. None of these cases, it is further stated, has ever reasoned in terms of requiring control of the corporate entity for the protection of such rights.\n\n63.\n\nThe task of this Tribunal is rendered easier in light of the *Lanco* case, where the same Argentina-United States BIT and the same definition of investment were interpreted. That tribunal examined jurisdiction under two separate headings, one under the Treaty and the other under the concession agreement, concluding that, while jurisdiction could be founded on either heading, the fact that the investor also had specific rights and obligations under the concession agreement, held to be equivalent to an investment agreement, made the conclusion still more evident. The tribunal held in this respect:\n\n\"The Tribunal finds that the definition of this term in the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty is very broad and allows for many meanings. For example, as regards shareholder equity, the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty says nothing indicating that the investor in the capital stock has to have control over the administration of the company, or a majority share; thus the fact that LANCO holds an equity share of 18.3% in the capital stock of the Grantee allows one to conclude that it is an investor in the meaning of Article 1 of the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty.\"\n\nNonetheless, the question is more complex considering that LANCO is not only the owner of an equity share in the capital stock of the grantee company, but also that the definition of 'investment' set forth in the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty allows one to conclude that LANCO has certain rights and obligations as a foreign investor under the Concession Agreement with the Government of the Argentine Republic.\"43\n\n*Supra*, note 37, pars. 10, 11.\n\n64.\n\nA similar approach was taken by the Committee on Annulment in the *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija* or *Vivendi* case, when holding under a different but comparable bilateral investment treaty:\n\n\"Moreover it cannot be argued that CGE did not have an 'investment' in CAA from the date of the conclusion of the Concession Contract, or that it was not an 'investor' in respect of its own shareholding, whether or not it had overall control of CAA. Whatever the extent of its investment may have been, it was entitled to invoke the BIT in respect of conduct alleged to constitute a breach fo Articles 3 or 5.\"44\n\n*Supra*, note 40, par. 50.\n\n65.\n\nIn light of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that jurisdiction can be established under the terms of the specific provisions of the BIT. Whether the protected investor is in addition a party to a concession agreement or a license agreement with the host State is immaterial for the purpose of finding jurisdiction under those treaty provisions, since there is a direct right of action of shareholders. It follows that the Claimant has *jus standi* before this Tribunal under international law, the 1965 Convention and the Argentina-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n\n**Jurisdictional objection on the dispute not arising directly from investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nIn close connection with the issues discussed above, the Republic of Argentina has raised a jurisdictional objection on the ground that the dispute does not arise directly from an investment as required by the 1965 Convention. In its view, while the acquisition of shares qualifies as an investment under the Treaty, neither TGN, as an Argentine corporation, nor the License qualify as an investment under the BIT. TGN, the argument follows, has its own assets, including the License; because these assets do not constitute an investment under the Treaty, CMS's claims, based on the alleged breach of TGN's rights under the License, cannot be considered to arise directly from an investment.\n\n67.\n\nCMS shares the view that TGN is not an investor under the Treaty, and that it has not been agreed to treat this company as a non-Argentine national because of foreign control. Neither is the License an investment under the Treaty. However, CMS adds, its 29.42% share in TGN qualifies as an investment covered under the Treaty and no majority or controlling ownership is required and hence CMS has the right to claim for compensation in the case of a dispute that arises directly out of its investment in those shares. The dispute, it is further explained, does not relate to TGN's rights but to those arising from the Treaty.\n\n68.\n\nBecause, as noted above, the rights of the Claimant can be asserted independently from the rights of TGN and those relating to the License, and because the Claimant has a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the protected investment, the Tribunal concludes that the present dispute arises directly from the investment made and that therefore there is no bar to the exercise of jurisdiction on this count.\n\n69.\n\nThere is still another point of contention between the parties. The Republic of Argentina believes that, in any event, CMS could only claim for the 25% share of ownership of TGN it purchased from the Argentine government, but not for the full 29.42% it actually owns, as the additional shares were bought from the employee share program. CMS is of the view that its full participation in TGN is the covered investment. Without prejudice that the extent of eventual damages will be an aspect to be discussed at the merits phase of this case, the Tribunal believes that the BIT does not make any differentiation as to the origin of the shares constituting the investment. It is only concerned with the question of State measures that can eventually affect the rights of the investor. It is therefore held that, again *prima facie*, the investor can make its claim for the full share of its participation in TGN.\n\n**Jurisdictional objection on not following contractual dispute settlement**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nA separate jurisdictional objection raised by the Republic of Argentina is based on the argument that TGN's License has a separate dispute settlement mechanism before the Federal Courts of Buenos Aires on Contentious Administrative Matters. Similarly, it is argued, the Terms of the License provide for the submission of disputes to the Federal Courts of Buenos Aires on Civil and Commercial matters, entailing an express renunciation to any other forum or jurisdiction. All of this, in the Respondent's view, precludes submission to the instant dispute to an ICSID tribunal.\n\n71.\n\nCMS objects to that reasoning on the basis that it is not a party to the License and that the dispute does not arise from the Terms of the License. The dispute, it is argued, relates to the breach of the BIT and its cause of action is founded exclusively on the dispute settlement mechanism of that Treaty, independently from whether there is in addition a dispute concerning the contract. The Claimant notes moreover that the disputes envisaged in the Terms of the License refer only to questions connected with sale of the shares.45\n\nTGN License of December 18, 1992, Article 1.3.4, approved by Decree 2457/92.\n\n72.\n\nThe task of the Tribunal is again rendered easier by the fact that a number of recent ICSID cases have had to discuss and decide on similar or comparable provisions concerning contracts and the scope of the Treaty. First, it is well established that consent to ICSID jurisdiction is to the exclusion of any other remedy pursuant to Article 26 of the Convention. The tribunal in *Lanco,* for example, held in this respect:\n\n\"... when the parties give their consent to ICSID arbitration, they lose their right to seek to settle the dispute in any other forum, domestic or international, and it therefore presupposes the non-interference of any other forum with the ICSID arbitration proceeding once such proceeding has been instituted.\"46\n\n*Supra*, note 37, par. 36.\n\n73.\n\nNeither in the **Lanco** case nor in the instant case is there a requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies as a pre-condition to ICSID jurisdiction that could bring into play other jurisdictions. The Tribunal also concluded in **Lanco** that:\n\n\"In effect, the offer made by the Argentine Republic to covered investors under the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty cannot be diminished by the submission to Argentina's domestic courts, to which the Concession Agreement remits.\"47\n\n*Supra*, note 37, par. 40.\n\n74.\n\nFollowing in part the *Lanco* precedent, another ICSID tribunal held in the *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija* :\n\n\"Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract does not divest this Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear this case because that provision did not and could not constitute a waiver by CGE of its rights under Article 8 of the BIT to file the pending claims against the Argentine Republic. (...) [T]hose claims are not based on the Concession Contract but allege a cause of action under the BIT. (...) Thus, Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract cannot be deemed to prevent the investor from proceeding under the ICSID Convention against the Argentine Republic on a claim charging the Argentine Republic with a violation of the Argentine-French BIT.\"48\n\n*Supra*, note 39, pars. 53-54.\n\n75.\n\nThe Annulment Committee held in *Wena* :\n\n\"The Committee cannot ignore of course that there is a connection between the leases and the IPPA since the former were designed to operate under the protection of the IPPA as the materialization of the investment. But this is simply a condition precedent to the operation of the IPPA. It does not involve an amalgamation of different legal instruments and dispute settlement arrangements. (...) [T]he acts or failures to act of the State cannot be considered as a question connected to the performance of the parties under the leases. The private and public functions of these various instruments are thus kept separate and distinct.\"49\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, ICSID Annulment Decision of February 5, 2002, par. 35. The IPPA is the relevant Bilateral Investment Treaty between Egypt and the United Kingdom.\n\n76.\n\nThis Tribunal shares the views expressed in those precedents. It therefore holds that the clauses in the License or its Terms referring certain kinds of disputes to the local courts of the Republic of Argentina are not a bar to the assertion of jurisdiction by an ICSID tribunal under the Treaty, as the functions of these various instruments are different.\n\n**Jurisdictional objection on the \"fork in the road\" triggering**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe considerations made above also help the Tribunal on another jurisdictional objection raised by the Republic of Argentina, namely that the investor triggered the \"fork in the road\" provision of Article VII(3)(a) of the Treaty. The Republic of Argentina argues that because TGN appealed a judicial decision to the Federal Supreme Court and other administrative remedies were sought, CMS cannot now submit the same dispute to arbitration under the Treaty.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimant's view is different. First, there is no triggering of the \"fork in the road\" provision because TGN is a separate legal entity and is not the investor; only the investor can make the choice of taking a claim to the local courts or to arbitration, and CMS chose the ICSID arbitration option. Second, the court's decision appealed by TGN related to judicial proceedings initiated by the Argentine Ombudsman and in which TGN only intervened as a third party; moreover, both the Argentine Government and ENARGS & the regulatory agency of the gas industry & also appealed that particular decision. It follows, the argument further elaborates, that the Licensee was only undertaking defensive and reactive actions in those proceedings. And third, CMS argues, not only are the parties to those proceedings and to the arbitration different but also the subject-matter of the dispute is not the same; TGN's claim concerns the contractual arrangements under the License while those of CMS concern the affected treaty rights.\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimant has also explained that TGN has been prevented from making a claim before the courts or through arbitration because of the provisions of Decree 1090/02 of June 26, 2002, and the Ministry of Economy Resolution 308/02 of August 20, 2002. These provisions direct the licensee to make its claims for breach of contract only in the context of the renegotiation process under way and not before the court; if the latter action is followed, the licensee will be excluded from such renegotiation. This situation, it is further explained, evidences again that TGN could not bring a claim before the Argentine courts and has not done so. In any event, as mentioned above, such a claim would be entirely separate from that of CMS under the Treaty.\n\n80.\n\nDecisions of several ICSID tribunals have held that as contractual claims are different from treaty claims even if there had been or there currently was a recourse to the local courts for breach of contract, this would not have prevented submission of the treaty claims to arbitration.50 This Tribunal is persuaded that with even more reason this view applies to the instant dispute, since no submission has been made by CMS to local courts and since, even if TGN had done so & which is not the case &, this would not result in triggering the \"fork in the road\" provision against CMS. Both the parties and the causes of action under separate instruments are different.\n\n*See* for example *Aguas*, **supra**, note 39, *Genin*, **supra**, note 38, *Olguin v. Paraguay*, Decision of the ICSID Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of August 8, 2000.\n\n81.\n\nHad the Claimant renounced recourse to arbitration, for example by resorting to the courts of Argentina, this would have been a binding selection under the BIT. In that case, the Tribunal would agree with Counsel for the Republic of Argentina that although Carlos Calvo, a distinguished Argentine international jurist who fathered the Calvo Doctrine and Clause, will not become an honorary citizen of countries having entered into bilateral investment treaties, this would still be a binding decision.51 However, as no such renunciation took place, the Calvo Clause will not resuscitate in this context.\n\nHearing, April 7, 2003, at 75.\n\n82.\n\nThe issue did not pass unnoticed during the approval and ratification of the BIT. In the letter of submittal of the BIT to the United States Congress, the U.S. President explained:\n\n\"The bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with Argentina represents an important milestone in the BIT program. (...) Argentina, like many other Latin American countries, has long subscribed to the Calvo Doctrine, which requires that aliens submit disputes arising in a country to that country's local courts. The conclusion of this treaty, which contains an absolute right to international arbitration of investment disputes, removes U.S. investors from the restrictions of the Calvo Doctrine and should help pave the way for similar agreements with other Latin American states.\"52\n\nLetter of Submittal by the President of the United States, January 13, 1993, U.S. Government Printing Office, Treaty Doc. 103-2, 1993.\n\n**Objections on assumed consequences**\n--------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has also expressed concern about some consequences which could arise from the finding of jurisdiction by this Tribunal. In particular, the following possible situations were mentioned: (i) TGN could come to a successful finalization of the negotiation process under way and, separately, an ICSID tribunal could reach a different conclusion; (ii) the eventual discrimination which could take place between domestic and foreign investors in TGN as only the latter have access to arbitration; and (iii) the eventual multiplication of international claims by investors of different nationalities and under separate treaties.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that it cannot be assumed that CMS is entitled to claim compensation in proportion to its 29.42% share in TGN because, if TGN were to be compensated for measures adopted by Argentina, there is no guarantee that such benefit would flow through to TGN's shareholders.\n\n85.\n\nIn the Claimant's views those considerations are not relevant to jurisdiction as it is quite inevitable that different treaty arrangements will assign rights to different investors and these rights most probably will be different from those of domestic investors. Moreover, CMS believes that the negotiation process is not likely to lead to a successful outcome. But, even it were, CMS affirms that it is not claims for TGN's losses but for its own loss in the investment venture.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in respect that the Centre has made every effort possible to avoid a multiplicity of tribunals and jurisdictions, but that it is not possible to foreclose rights that different investors might have under different arrangements. The Tribunal also notes that, while it might be desirable to recognize similar rights to domestic and foreign investors, this is seldom possible in the present state of international law in this field. Finally, it is not for the Tribunal to rule on the perspectives of the negotiation process or on what TGN might do in respect of its shareholders, as these are matters between Argentina and TGN or between TGN and its shareholders.\n\n**The law applicable to jurisdiction determination**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe parties have discussed, in their written presentations and in the hearings, the question of applicable law, with particular reference to the meaning of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention. The Republic of Argentina believes that, under this provision, Argentine law is applicable, not only in respect of the resolution of the substance of the dispute but also in respect of the jurisdictional questions the Tribunal has now to decide on. Counsel for the Republic of Argentina has also submitted that, as the Treaty is also part of Argentine law, that law can also be applied, particularly since the jurisdictional objections raised are not only based on Argentine law but also on the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. The Claimant takes a different view and argues that Article 42 is only applicable to the substance of the dispute, jurisdictional questions being decided on the basis of the Treaty and international law only.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 42 is mainly designed for the resolution of disputes on the merits and, as such, it is in principle independent from the decisions on jurisdiction, governed solely by Article 25 of the Convention and those other provisions of the consent instrument which might be applicable, in the instant case the Treaty provisions. However, the argument of the Republic of Argentina has merit in so far as the parties can agree to a different choice of law applicable also to jurisdictional questions. The very option the investor has under the Treaty to submit a dispute to local jurisdictional also involves to an extent a choice of law provision, as local courts will apply mainly domestic law. In such a case, domestic law might apply together with the Treaty and Convention or separately.\n\n89.\n\nSince Argentina believes that the \"fork in the road\" provision has been triggered as explained above, it is also reasonable to argue in that context for the application of Argentine law, including the Treaty as part thereof. However, as the dispute under the Treaty is in this case separate from that under the License and no \"fork in the road\" provision has been triggered, domestic law does not have a role to play in jurisdictional determination, at least not a direct one.\n\n**Objections to admissibility on the nature and number of disputes**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nIn addition to the questions of admissibility and jurisdiction raised by the Republic of Argentina discussed above, the Respondent advances three further objections against the admissibility of some of the CMS claims. According to the Republic of Argentina, (i) The original dispute has no relation with the dispute as stated by CMS in its Request for Arbitration; (ii) CMS has submitted to the Tribunal two different disputes and filing of the second dispute does not comply with the temporal conditions set forth in the Treaty; and (iii) The dispute relating to the alleged restrictions suffered by TGN to transfer funds abroad was not submitted in compliance with the terms of the Treaty.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize the arguments raised by Argentina on each of these points, as well as the answers given by CMS to these objections and it will arrive at a determination on each of them.\n\n**Relationship between the original dispute and that submitted to arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe first question concerns the absence of a relationship between the original dispute and the dispute as stated in the Request for Arbitration. According to the Republic of Argentina, CMS, in its letter of March 12, 2001, prior to notifying its consent to international arbitration, requested payment by Argentina to TGN of the appropriate adjustments to the tariffs based on the PPI. However, the subsequent Request for Arbitration alleges loss by CMS of the expected benefits of its investments and anticipates a claim in excess of USD 100 million. Consequently, the argument follows, the Request for Arbitration implies a claim different from the one submitted by the investor, in its letter of March 12, 2001.\n\n93.\n\nMoreover, the Republic of Argentina argues that CMS modified the terms of the dispute along its development. In particular, it was only in its Memorial that CMS disclosed that it intended to dispose of its shares in TGN and that, once it received compensation, it would transfer them to the Argentine Government. Consequently, it is argued, neither a dispute related to clearly identified issues between the parties nor a concrete claim was raised until CMS submitted its Memorial.\n\n94.\n\nCMS's position is that the dispute initially notified to Argentina is the same dispute as the one mentioned in the Request for Arbitration and that events occurring after the filing of the Request for Arbitration are part of the same dispute and are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It follows in the Claimant's view that there is no inconsistency between the notification of the dispute to Argentina and the Request for Arbitration.\n\n95.\n\nCMS further argues that there is no rule which requires a claimant to accurately or finally quantify its loss in its Request for Arbitration. It is only at the time of filing its memorial that a claimant is required to quantify its compensation claim, and even then the figure can be adjusted as the situation changes. This explains, according to CMS, that the estimate of losses for alleged breaches of the BIT at the time of the Request for Arbitration is one thing and the estimate made at the time of filing of its Memorial and taking into account measures adopted by the Government of Argentina after the Request is another thing.\n\n96.\n\nIn CMS's view, the other argument of the Respondent namely that CMS referred, only at the time of its Memorial, to its decision to relinquish ownership of its shares to Argentina upon receipt of compensation is also not relevant to the determination of jurisdiction. CMS argues that this is a merits-related matter and that, in any event, the issues were identified clearly and there was a concrete claim before the production of its Memorial. The offer to relinquish its shares was made by CMS in order to prevent any suggestion of double recovery.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with the Republic of Argentina's argumentation on this point. First, the Republic of Argentina refers to a CMS letter of March 12, 2001 requesting payment to TGN of the appropriate adjustments to the tariffs based on the PPI. In fact, a number of letters were sent by CMS to the Argentine authorities concerning this issue, beginning with a letter to the President of Argentina dated August 28, 2000, which under cover letters dated October 28, 2000, were transmitted to officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship;53 those letters drew to the attention of the authorities of a dispute between the Republic of Argentina and CMS about its investment in that country, mentioning specifically the impact upon CMS of the non-adjustment of the tariffs of TGN on the basis of the U.S. PPI and requesting the initiation of consultation and negotiations pursuant to Article VII(2) of the Treaty. That request was repeated in letters of October 27, 2000 to the same authorities,54 in another letter to the President of Argentina on December 12, 200055 and, finally, in the letter of March 12, 2001 referred to by the Respondent in its Memorial on Jurisdiction. While that letter requests that specific steps be taken to allow TGN to benefit from the application of the tariff adjustment in accordance with the Terms of the License granted to it, it also mentions that the absence of such adjustment has resulted in \"unlawful reduction of CMS's earnings\" and that it has affected its credit qualifications with financial institutions and rating agencies. It then states that, unless appropriate measures are taken to remedy the situation, CMS will file a request for arbitration. There does not appear to have been an answer to those various letters.\n\nExhibit 25 of the Request for Arbitration.\n\nExhibit 26 of the Request for Arbitration.\n\nExhibit 27 of the Request for Arbitration.\n\n98.\n\nThe six-month period provided by the Treaty for consultation and negotiation having expired without results, CMS formally notified the President of Argentina on July 12, 2001 that it was consenting to arbitration under the terms of the Treaty.56 In its Request for Arbitration of July 24, 2001, CMS alleges breaches of Article II(2)(a), (b) and (c) and of Article IV(1) of the Treaty and claims compensation for the ensuing damages.\n\nExhibit 30 of the Request for Arbitration.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that there is full correlation between the content of the letters sent to the Argentine authorities before the Request for Arbitration and the Request itself. The Republic of Argentina argues that if, in accordance with the request in the letter of March 12, 2001, it had paid to TGN the amount it is alleged should have been paid to it, the dispute with CMS would have been resolved, but it then adds that, in the absence of such payment, the subsequent claim by CMS for damages for loss of its investment constitutes a different matter. Referring to the decision on jurisdiction in *Maffezini v. Spain*,57 the Republic of Argentina affirms that the concrete claim formulated by CMS on March 12, 2001 \"is notoriously different from the one state in the Request for Arbitration.\"\n\n*Supra*, note 15.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, does not share the Respondent's line of reasoning. In its various letters preceding the Request for Arbitration, CMS clearly stated the nature of the dispute between CMS and Argentina, its impact upon its investment, and its request for consultation and negotiations under Article VII(2) of the Treaty. There could not have been any doubt, after receipt of those letters, as to what the dispute was about and the conclusions contained in the Request for Arbitration flowed naturally from the statements made in those letters. Argentina was presented with both clearly identified issues and a concrete claim. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot accept the objection to admissibility raised by the Republic of Argentina on this ground.\n\n**Two disputes or a single continuing dispute**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe second issue raised by the Republic of Argentina concerns the existence of two different and separate disputes. According to the Republic of Argentina, CMS has submitted to the Tribunal two different disputes. The First related mainly to actions taken by the Argentine Ombudsman and the judiciary, in August 2000, concerning the application of the PPI to tariffs of the gas industry. The second relates to measures adopted by the executive and legislative authorities during December 2001 and January 2002 and having to do with the major economic crisis faced by the country at that time. That second dispute, it is further affirmed, was not registered in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and the six-month period required by Article VII(3) of the Treaty between the dates a dispute arose and that of its submission for arbitration has not elapsed. The two disputes, in the Respondent's view, are independent of each other because they are separable in time, in their origins, in their scope, in their circumstances, in their causes and in their treatment.\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent argues in particular that the first dispute relates to a decision the effects of which do not go beyond the gas industry, while the additional dispute relates to measures of general scope affecting the whole economy in the context of the economic and social emergency referred to above. In the case of the original dispute, the Argentine Government and its regulatory agency challenged the judicial decision by the Ombudsman, while the situation concerning the additional dispute, it is believed is completely different.\n\n103.\n\nSimilarly, it is argued by the Respondent, the background of the original dispute is an alleged inconsistency between the Gas Law, the Convertibility Law and the national Constitution, while the background for the additional dispute is a general crisis and the impossibility of maintaining a certain monetary and exchange rate policy.\n\n104.\n\nThe measure which gave rise to the first dispute, the Respondent explains, did not require a specific negotiation process with the affected companies. In contrast, there is a specific renegotiation process currently taking place in the context of a general contracts renegotiation concerning public utilities. In fact, it is further stated, as such renegotiation is ongoing with the public utilities concerned one should not prejudge what the conclusion of that process will be; a direct claim can only be made when the situation it deals with is irreversible and definitive.\n\n105.\n\nAccording to CMS, the post-July events related to the same subject-matter as those before July 2001. The December 2001 and January 2002 measures constituted new facts in the same dispute relating to the Republic of Argentina's interference with the tariff regime, suspending and then abolishing the PPI adjustment of tariffs completely and removing the right to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars and then express them in convertible pesos at the time of billing. The so-called additional dispute relates to the same subject-matter, the same factual background and the same causes of action.\n\n106.\n\nIn any event, CMS concludes on this matter, the fact that the post-July 2001 events were not mentioned in the Request for Arbitration does not affect the Claimant's entitlement to submit them to the Tribunal in its Memorial. CMS affirms that Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 2(1)(e) of the ICSID Institution Rules only require the request to \"contain information concerning the issue in dispute,\" and that accordingly, Arbitration Rule 31 indicates that it is only at the time of its memorial that the claimant is required to argue its claims with specificity. Moreover, under Article 46 of the Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, CMS argues its entitlement to bring the matter as an additional or incidental claim because both clauses specifically provide for such a possibility.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondent's conclusions on this second issue and it will deal with the various arguments raised by Argentina in that regard. First, whether certain events occurred before and others after the Request for Arbitration is not a determinant factor in deciding whether the Tribunal is seized with one or more disputes. What the Tribunal has to decide, in light of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 40, is whether those claims arise directly out of the subject matter of the disputes, whether they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and whether they are within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n108.\n\nIn so far as the international liability of Argentina under the Treaty is concerned, it also does not matter whether some actions were taken by the judiciary and others by an administrative agency, the executive or the legislative branch of the State. Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility adopted by the International Law Commission is abundantly clear on this point.58 Unless a specific reservation is made in accordance with Articles 19, 20 and 23 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the responsibility of the State can be engaged and the fact that some actions were taken by the judiciary and others by other state institutions does not necessarily make them separate disputes. No such reservation took place in connection with the BIT.\n\nJames Crawford: *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility*, 2002, Comments on Article 4 at 94-99.\n\n109.\n\nAt the outset of this Decision, the Tribunal drew the line between acts which directly affect the investor's rights under binding legal commitments and other acts which relate to questions of public policy. Actions which affect those rights will normally relate to measures specifically addressed to the gas industry, but they may also be adopted in conjunction with measures of a more general nature. As long as they affect the investor in violation of its rights and cover the same subject matter, the fact that they may originate from different sources or emerge at different times does not necessarily mean that the disputes are separate and distinct. The Tribunal is also mindful that, as explained above, what the Claimant has now to demonstrate that *prima facie* it has been affected by actions adopted in violation of its rights and this burden has been met.\n\n110.\n\nOn a similar line of reasoning, so long as the rights of the investor are affected in a direct manner, what justified the judicial decision of August 18, 2000 and what motivated the adoption of administrative and legislative measures in December 2001 and January 2002 does not alter the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. As noted, it is only when the measures in question are unrelated to specific legal commitments made to the investor that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal will be excluded and liability non-existent. Equally, the fact that the Government of Argentina and one of its regulatory agencies have challenged the above-mentioned judicial decision while the Government has supported the post-July 2001 measures is irrelevant in deciding whether the Tribunal is called upon to deal with one or two disputes.\n\n111.\n\nThe argument that the background to the so-called two disputes is different is also not a deciding factor as to whether there are one or two disputes. What the Tribunal has to look at is the nature of the dispute or disputes; their background may be different but again, what counts is whether the rights of the investor have been affected or not and whether the claims arise directly out of the same subject-matter.\n\n112.\n\nThe argument that the first dispute did not require negotiations with the companies concerned while the second opened the door to a renegotiation process is not convincing. The Tribunal is faced with a Request for Arbitration between a foreign investor and the Republic of Argentina under the BIT, the investor claiming that some of its protected rights have been interfered with. The disputants are CMS and the Republic of Argentina; as noted above, whether there are some negotiations taking place between the Government of Argentina and some third parties on some of the same events which gave rise to the dispute cannot be a matter for the Tribunal's consideration, at least not at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful that the essential facts relating, first, to the suspension of the PPI adjustment in 2000 and the enactment of the other measures in December 2001 and January 2002 are not contested. There is no disagreement between the parties about the fact that CMS is the investor in the affected company, TGN. Rather the problem lies in the effect that each party assigns to each of these matters.\n\n114.\n\nIn order to establish whether the Tribunal is faced with one or two disputes, it is worthwhile keeping in mind that CMS's request for relief in its Request for Arbitration of July 2001 concerns in essence the breach of various rights it alleges to have under the BIT. These rights relate mainly to fair and equitable treatment and full security and protection, arbitrariness and discrimination, observance of obligation and indirect expropriation without compensation.\n\n115.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration contains a list of the measures which are alleged to be in breach of the Treaty and CMS specifically reserves the right to update its claims in the course of the proceedings. CMS argues that \"there is one continuing dispute involving Argentina's interference with and dismantling of the tariff regime that it committed to foreign investors would apply for the gas transportation sector.\"59\n\nHearing of April 7, 2003, at 113\n\n**Ancillary claims**\n--------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe question to be addressed by the Tribunal is then whether the claims for post-July 2001 events are \"incidental or additional claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute.\"60 Note B to Arbitration Rule 40 adds the following explanation:\n\n\"The test to satisfy this condition is whether the factual connection between the original and the ancillary claim is so close as to require the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute, the object being to dispose of all grounds of dispute arising out of the same subject matter.\"\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n117.\n\nTo this end the Tribunal must reach a determination on the subject-matter of the dispute and decide whether the ancillary or additional claim arises directly out of that subject matter.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, in the instant case, the subject-matter of the dispute is the alleged loss by CMS of its investment in TGN caused, it is argued, by the breaches by the Republic of Argentina of its obligation under the BIT. Such breaches relate, in the Claimant's view, to the interference of organs of the Argentine State with the tariff regime applicable to TGN, which was first subjected to deferral of adjustments, followed by a freeze, culminating in the abrogation of that adjustment and the removal of the right to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars and then express them in convertible pesos at the time of billing.\n\n119.\n\nNote B to Arbitration Rule 40 supports the conclusion that the post-July 2001 events give rise to incidental or additional claims. There is no doubt, in the mind of the Tribunal, that the claim resulting from those events is \"so close as to require the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute, the object being to dispose of all the grounds of dispute arising out of the same subject matter.\"\n\n120.\n\nTribunals in two cases61 under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, the first one under the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules and the other under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, reached the same conclusion, on the basis of acts similar to those in the present case.62\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico*, Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, (August 30, 2000), 40 ILM (2001), 36; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada* (Award Concerning the Motion by Government of Canada Respecting the Claim Based upon the Imposition of the \"Super Fee\" (August 7, 2000)). Legal Authorities No. 95.\n\nIt is worth noting that the UNCITRAL Rules do not provide for ancillary claims as such. Article 20 of those Rules states that: \"During the course of arbitral proceedings either party may amend or supplement his claim or defense unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances. However, a claim may not be amended in such a manner that the amended claim falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause or separate arbitration agreement.\" In many instances, the distinction between supplementing a claim and introducing an ancillary claim may be more semantic than real. However, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 40 are more restrictive in the sense that the ancillary claim must arise directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute and that it must be made no later than in the reply, if it is an additional or incidental claim, and no later than the counter-memorial, if it is a counter-claim. In the *Pope & Talbot* case, the tribunal concluded that the issue raised by the Claimant \"is not a new claim and consequently no amendment of the Claim is required.\"\n\n**Observance of consultation period**\n-------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nIn connection with its allegation about the existence of two separate disputes, the Republic of Argentina has also made the argument that submission to arbitration of the second dispute is inadmissible because it is premature. Under the Treaty, it is maintained, the six-month period referred to above must have elapsed, but the additional dispute was only formally raised with the Government of Argentina on February 13, 2002, some six months after the registration of the case by the Secretary-General of ICSID, on August 24, 2001. The Request for Arbitration was limited to the original dispute relating the U.S. PPI and does not include the additional subject-matter. Since that dispute is different from the first one, the argument follows, it would have required a separate request for arbitration, after the expiry of the above-mentioned six-month period, the whole in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Article VII(3) of the BIT.\n\n122.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, however, the six-month negotiation period is a procedural and not a jurisdictional or admissibility requirement. Provided the parties have had an opportunity to engage in negotiations, and in particular whether the host State has shown no willingness to take this opportunity, the registration period requirement must be deemed to be satisfied. Moreover, it is concluded, the Republic of Argentina has suffered and will suffer no prejudice as a result of the inclusion of the post-July 2001 events.\n\n123.\n\nThis argument need not be addressed by the Tribunal in light of its conclusion above that there is a single dispute which contains, however, incidental or additional claims. It is clear from the ICSID Arbitration Rules that such claims do not require either a new request for arbitration or a new six-month period for consultation or negotiation, before the submission of the dispute to arbitration under the Treaty. Rule 40(2) which provides that \"an incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than the reply.\" But even if it is thought that the period in question does apply, the Tribunal is mindful that CMS, as explained above, repeatedly invited the Argentine Government to undertake consultations on this matter, albeit to no avail. It cannot then be argued that any prejudice has ensued or will ensue for the Republic of Argentina in this context.\n\n**Discussion of additional assumed consequences**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent has also argued in connection with the two-disputes issue that admitting the additional dispute would constitute a dangerous precedent with the following consequences: (i) an incentive for investors to submit claims ignoring the required six-month period for consultation and negotiation and depriving governments of an opportunity to evaluate the situation; (ii) a disruption of the renegotiation process of public utilities which is currently taking place in Argentina; (iii) since the Tribunal was not given jurisdiction to decide any dispute other than the one which was registered on the basis of the Request for Arbitration, the Tribunal, if it heard the additional dispute, would deprive Argentina of its right of defence. The Claimant does not share these views.\n\n125.\n\nAs the Tribunal has concluded that, in this case, the disputes are not separate and independent and relate to the same subject-matter, it is immaterial whether the pertinent events occurred before or after the submission of the dispute to arbitration as long as any ancillary claim is made before reply, as required by Arbitration Rule 40(2). The nefarious effects feared by the Republic of Argentina will therefore not occur as a consequence of this determination. Rather, nefarious effects would occur if the Tribunal reached a different conclusion for, as the tribunal held in *Metalclad* : \"A contrary holding would require a claimant to file multiple subsequent and related actions and would lead to inefficiency and inequity.\"63 The Tribunal wishes to stress, however, that law alone provided all the necessary elements to support the conclusion reached by the Tribunal in the present case.\n\n*Supra*, note 61, par. 67.\n\n126.\n\nAs explained above, the Tribunal also cannot consider the question of whether the current negotiations with various public utilities companies are going well, as believed by the Respondent, or not at all, as affirmed by the Claimant. Those are *res inter alios acta* ; it may be that, when the Tribunal comes to address the merits of this case, those elements will have to be taken into consideration but, at this stage, they are irrelevant for the purpose of determining jurisdiction.\n\n**Jurisdiction affirmed**\n-------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIn light of all the elements discussed above, the Tribunal concludes that the claims resulting from post-July 2001 events, to the extent that they cause damage to the investor in breach of its rights, are of the nature of ancillary claims which, in conformity with Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 40, arise directly out of the dispute, are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n128.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has also raised a question of admissibility in connection with CMS's allegation that it suffered damage connected with the transfer of funds, since this claim has never been presented as a disputed issue under the BIT. However, as noted above, because CMS is not pursuing this claim, at least for the time being, the question of admissibility is rendered moot.\n\n129.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina has also requested that CMS provide evidence, in connection with Article I(2) of the BIT, that it is not controlled by nationals of a third country and that it has substantial business activities in the United States. Upon review of the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal concludes that CMS has provided such evidence and the record is abundantly clear on this matter.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to note in concluding that counsel for both parties have performed their duties with outstanding professionalism and have at all times fully cooperated with the work of the Tribunal, an attitude for which they must be commended. Their respective arguments have been made in the spirit of professionalism and have raised questions of great importance for this case, ICSID arbitration and arbitration in general.\n\n**C. Decision**\n---------------\n\n131.\n\nFor the reasons stated above the Tribunal decides that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. The Tribunal has, accordingly, made the necessary Order for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4)."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2005-05-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**A.

In rendering its Award, the Tribunal has taken into account all pleadings, documents and testimony in this case insofar as it considered them relevant.\n\n**B. Summary of the Procedure**\n-------------------------------\n\n*1. Procedure Leading to the Decision on Jurisdiction*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn July 26, 2001, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) received from CMS Gas Transmission Company (CMS), an entity incorporated in the United States of America, a Request for Arbitration against the Argentine Republic (Argentina). The request concerned the alleged suspension by Argentina of a tariff adjustment formula for gas transportation applicable to an enterprise in which CMS had an investment. In its request, the Claimant invoked the provisions of the 1991 \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment.\" (The Argentina - U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty or BIT or the Treaty).1\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, November 14, 1991, in force from October 20, 1994. Hereafter cited as the U.S.-Argentina BIT or the Treaty.\n\n5.\n\nOn July 27, 2001, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the request to Argentina and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n6.\n\nOn August 15, 2001, the Centre requested CMS to confirm that the dispute referred to in the request had not been submitted by CMS for resolution in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed, dispute-settlement procedure, under Article VII (2)(b) of the BIT. On August 23, 2001, CMS confirmed that it had taken no such steps.\n\n7.\n\nOn August 24, 2001, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention (the Convention). On this same date, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n8.\n\nOn August 30, 2001, the Centre reminded Argentina of the Claimant's proposal concerning the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. Under this proposal, contained in paragraph 60 of the request for arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third, who would be President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn September 13, 2001, Argentina informed the Centre of its agreement to the proposal of CMS concerning the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. On the same date the Centre informed the parties that since their agreement on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment was equivalent to the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention, the parties were invited to follow the procedure set forth in Arbitration Rule 3 for the appointment of arbitrators.\n\n10.\n\nOn October 24, 2001 Argentina appointed H. E. Judge Francisco Rezek, a national of Brazil, as an arbitrator. On November 9, 2001, CMS appointed The Honorable Marc Lalonde P.C., O.C., Q.C., a national of Canada, as an arbitrator. The parties, however, failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding, arbitrator. In these circumstances, by letter of December 5, 2001, the Claimant requested that the third, presiding, arbitrator in the proceeding be appointed in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.2\n\nUnder Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, if the Tribunal is not constituted within 90 days after the notice of registration of the request has been dispatched, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council shall, at the request of either party, and after consulting both parties as far as possible, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed and designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nAfter consultation with the parties, Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a national of Chile, was duly appointed as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On January 11, 2002, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Alejandro Escobar, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held on February 4, 2002, at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. At the session the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n13.\n\nDuring the course of the first session the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal; and the Tribunal, after ascertaining the views of the parties on the matter, fixed the following time limits for the written phase of the proceedings: The Claimant would file a memorial within 120 days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a countermemorial within 120 days from its receipt of the Claimant's memorial; the Claimant would file a reply within 60 days from its receipt of the counter-memorial; and the Respondent would file its rejoinder within 60 days from its receipt of the reply. At the first session it was further agreed that in the event of the Respondent raising objections to jurisdiction, the following time limits would apply: the Respondent would file its memorial on jurisdiction within 60 days from its receipt of the Claimant's memorial on the merits; the Claimant would file its counter-memorial on jurisdiction within 60 days from its receipt of the Respondent's memorial on jurisdiction; the Respondent would file its reply on jurisdiction within 30 days from its receipt of the Claimant's counter-memorial on jurisdiction; and the Claimant would file its rejoinder on jurisdiction within 30 days from its receipt of the Respondent's reply on jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nOn May 24, 2002, the Claimant requested an extension till July 5, 2002 of the time limit fixed for the filing of its memorial. On June 6, 2002, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by the Claimant. In doing so, the Tribunal noted that Argentina would be entitled to an equivalent extension if requested, of the time limit fixed for its counter-memorial.\n\n15.\n\nOn July 5, 2002, the Claimant filed its memorial on the merits and accompanying documentation. On August 5, 2002, Ms. Margrete Stevens, Senior Counsel, ICSID, replaced Mr. Alejandro Escobar as Secretary of the Tribunal. On September 4, 2002, Argentina requested an extension till October 7, 2002, of the time limit fixed for the filing of the memorial on jurisdiction. On September 11, 2002, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by Argentina. On October 7, 2002, Argentina filed its memorial on jurisdiction.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 24, 2002, following the Respondent's filing of objections to jurisdiction, the proceeding on the merits was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n17.\n\nOn December 17, 2002, the Claimant submitted its counter-memorial on jurisdiction. On January 22, 2003, the parties requested an extension of 30 days for each of the remaining two jurisdictional filings. On January 27, 2003, the Tribunal granted the extensions, and fixed the time limit for the filing of the Respondent's reply on jurisdiction for February 11, 2003; and the time limit for the filing of the Claimant's rejoinder on jurisdiction for March 25, 2003.\n\n18.\n\nOn February 13, 2003, the Respondent filed its reply on jurisdiction, and on March 25, 2003, the Claimant filed its rejoinder on jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nOn April 7-8, 2003, the hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Ms. Lucy Reed and Messrs. Nigel Blackaby, Jonathan Sutcliffe and Guido Tawil addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. Mr. Ignacio Suarez Anzorena addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Argentina. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n20.\n\nOn July 17, 2003, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Decision on the Objections to Jurisdiction raised by the Argentine Republic. In its Decision, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's contention that the Claimant could not, as a minority shareholder, bring a claim against Argentina and confirmed that the dispute arose directly from an investment made by the Claimant. On this basis, the Tribunal concluded that the Centre had jurisdiction and that the Tribunal was competent to consider the dispute between the parties in accordance with the provisions of the Argentina - U.S. BIT.\n\n21.\n\nCertified copies of the Tribunal's decision were distributed to the parties by the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n*2. Procedure Leading to the Award on the Merits*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn July 17, 2003, the Tribunal, following its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, issued, in accordance with Rules 19 and 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules of the Centre, Procedural Order No. 1 on the continuation of the proceeding on the merits. In that Procedural Order the Tribunal fixed the following schedule for the further procedures: as the Claimant had already filed its memorial on the merits of the dispute, the Respondent was directed to file a counter-memorial on the merits within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the Order; the Claimant would file a reply on the merits within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Respondent's counter-memorial; and the Respondent would file a rejoinder on the merits within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claimant's reply. The Order further contemplated that the Tribunal would propose a date for the hearing on the merits once it had received the above-indicated memorials.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of October 2, 2003, the Respondent filed a request for suspension of the proceeding. By letter of October 14, 2003, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to file, no later than October 20, 2003, its observations on the Respondent's request for suspension; by letter of October 17, 2003 the Claimant filed its observations on the Respondent's request of October 2, 2003.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of October 22, 2003, the Respondent filed a request for an extension of the time limit for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of October 30, 2003, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties of the Tribunal's decision to grant the Respondent's request for a 30-day extension for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits; the new time limit was fixed for December 17, 2003.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of October 31, 2003, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties of the Tribunal's decision not to grant the Respondent's request for suspension of the proceeding.\n\n27.\n\nOn December 22, 2003, the Respondent filed its counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of December 23, 2003, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties of the Tribunal's proposal to fix the hearing on the merits for two weeks to begin at the end of May 2004.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of January 7, 2004, the Respondent requested that the oral hearing be scheduled for the end of July 2004.\n\n30.\n\nAfter consultation with both sides, the Tribunal informed the parties by letter of January 14, 2004 of its intention to fix the hearing on the merits for August 2004.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter of January 20, 2004, the Claimant filed a request for a five-week extension of the time limit for the filing of its reply on the merits.\n\n32.\n\nAfter further consultations with both sides, the Tribunal informed the parties by letter of February 6, 2004 that the hearing on the merits would be held on August 9-20, 2004. Both parties confirmed their agreement that the hearing be held in Paris, France. By that same letter, the parties were informed that the Tribunal would grant the Claimant a four-week extension for the filing of its reply on the merits, and would similarly grant the Respondent a four-week extension for the filing of its rejoinder on the merits, should it so wish. The new time limit for the filing of the Claimant's reply on the merits was fixed for March 22, 2004.\n\n33.\n\nOn February 12, 2004, the Respondent filed a \"Certificate Confirming the State of Necessity in Argentina.\"\n\n34.\n\nOn March 22, 2004, the Claimant filed its reply on the merits.\n\n35.\n\nOn May 27, 2004, the President held a conference call with counsel for the parties to discuss procedural arrangements for the hearing on the merits.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of June 17, 2004, the Tribunal directed the Argentine Republic to file all remaining witness statements and expert reports with its rejoinder on the merits on June 25, 2004. To the extent that such statements and reports would not be available to the Argentine Republic on June 25, 2004, these were to be filed no later than July 9, 2004, i.e. no later than one month prior to the commencement of the hearing on the merits in Paris. In these circumstances, the Argentine Republic was requested to indicate on June 25, 2004, the names of any additional witnesses and experts whose statements or reports would be filed no later than July 9, 2004, and the subject-matter to which their testimony would be directed.\n\n37.\n\nOn June 28, 2004, the Respondent filed its rejoinder on the merits.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter of July 12, 2004, the Claimant objected to the late presentation of certain evidence introduced by Argentina with its rejoinder; and reserved its right to respond with additional contemporaneous documents which it indicated would be very limited in number.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter of July 13, 2004, the President of the Tribunal directed the parties to exchange, on July 20, 2004, lists of the names of those witnesses that each party wished to examine, and requested that the parties inform the Secretariat of the names of the persons that would be attending the hearing on behalf of each side.\n\n40.\n\nThe parties filed their respective lists on July 20, 2004.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter of August 4, 2004, the Tribunal gave directions on the conduct of the hearing.\n\n42.\n\nThe hearing would commence August 9, 2004, which would be devoted to opening statements. The Claimant would present its statement in the morning; and the Respondent would present its statement in the afternoon.\n\n43.\n\nThe period from August 10, 2004 - August 19, 2004 would be devoted to the presentation of evidence. The Claimant would begin with its examination of fact witnesses, to be followed by the Respondent's examination of fact witnesses. The same order would be followed (i.e. first the Claimant, to be followed by the Respondent) with respect to the presentation of expert evidence. However, to the extent possible, the parties were invited to organize such expert evidence around subject-matter.\n\n44.\n\nThe hearing would conclude on August 20, 2004, with each party presenting its closing statement.\n\n45.\n\nThe hearing on the merits was held, as scheduled, from August 9-20, 2004, at the World Bank's office at 66, avenue d'I\u00e9na, Paris. Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal*\n\nProfessor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, President\n\nThe Hon.

Considerations**\n---------------------\n\n*3. The Privatization Program as the Background to the Dispute*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nAs had been observed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction,3 the Argentine Republic embarked in 1989 on economic reforms, which included the privatization of important industries and public utilities as well as the participation of foreign investment. Gas transportation was one of the significant sectors to be included under this reform program. The basic instruments governing these economic reforms were Law No. 23,696 on the Reform of the State of 1989,4 Law No. 23,928 on Currency Convertibility of 19915 and Decree No. 2128/91 fixing the Argentine peso at par with the United States dollar.\n\nCMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Republic of Argentina, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003, 42 *ILM* 788 (2003).\n\nLaw No. 23,696 of 1989 on the Reform of the State.\n\nLaw No. 23,928 of 1991 on Convertibility\n\n54.\n\nWithin this broad framework specific instruments were enacted to govern the privatization of the main industries. As far as the Gas sector was concerned, Law No. 24,076 of 1992, or Gas Law,6 established the basic rules for the transportation and distribution of natural gas. This instrument was implemented the same year by Decree No. 1738/92 or Gas Decree.7\n\nLaw No. 24,076 of 1992 on the Privatization of the Gas Sector (Gas Law).\n\nDecree No. 1738/92 on the Implementation of the Gas Law (Gas Decree).\n\n55.\n\nAs a consequence of the new legislation, Gas del Estado, a State-owned entity, was divided into two transportation companies and eight distribution companies. Transportadora de Gas del Norte (TGN) was one of the companies created for gas transportation.8 The privatization of the new company was opened to investors by means of a public tender offer9 and a related Information Memorandum was prepared by consultant and investment firms in 1992 at the request of the Government.10\n\nDecree No. 1189/92 establishing TGN and other companies.\n\nPliego de Bases y Condiciones, Llamado a Licitaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica Internacional para la Privatizaci\u00f3n de Gas del Estado, July 17, 1992.\n\nInformation Memorandum on the Privatization of Gas del Estado, prepared by N. M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., September 1992.\n\n56.\n\nA Model License approved by Decree No. 2255/9211 established the basic terms and conditions for the licenses that each new company would be granted by the Argentine Government. TGN's license was granted by Decree No. 2457/9212 for a period of thirty-five years, subject to extension for another ten years on the fulfillment of certain conditions.\n\nDecree No. 2255/92, December 2, 1992.\n\nDecree No. 2457/92, December 18, 1992 (License).\n\n57.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the legislation and regulations enacted, as well as the license, resulted in a legal regime under which tariffs were to be calculated in dollars, conversion to pesos was to be effected at the time of billing and tariffs would be adjusted every six months in accordance with the United States Producer Price Index (US PPI). As will be examined further below, the Respondent has a different understanding of the nature and legal effects of these various instruments.\n\n58.\n\nCMS's participation in TGN began in 1995 under a 1995 Offering Memorandum13 leading to the purchase of the shares still held by the government. CMS's acquisition represented 25% of the company, later supplemented by the purchase of an additional 4.42%, thus totaling 29.42% of TGN's shares. This new Offering Memorandum was modeled on the 1992 Information Memorandum and the license.\n\nOffering Memorandum of July 7, 1995.\n\n*4. Argentina's Measures in the Period 1999-2002 and the Emergence of the Dispute*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nTowards the end of the 1990's a serious economic crisis began to unfold in Argentina, which eventually had profound political and social ramifications. The nature and extent of this crisis will be discussed below.\n\n60.\n\nAgainst this background, the Argentine Government called in late 1999 for a meeting with representatives of the gas companies in order to discuss a temporary suspension of the US PPI adjustment of the gas tariffs. The companies agreed to a temporary suspension deferring the adjustment due for a period of six months (January 1 - June 30, 2000). The agreement provided that costs of the deferral would be recouped in the period July 1, 2000 -April 30, 2001, that resulting income losses would be indemnified and it was understood that this arrangement would not set a precedent or amend the legal framework governing the licenses. This agreement was approved by ENARGAS, the public regulatory agency of the gas industry, by Resolution No. 1471 on January 10, 2000.14\n\nENARGAS Resolution No. 1471, January 10, 2000.\n\n61.\n\nSoon thereafter it became apparent that the agreement would not be implemented and requests by TGN for an adjustment of tariffs in accordance with the License were not acted upon; in fact ENARGAS directed the company to refrain from introducing any such adjustment. On July 17, 2000, a further meeting was held with representatives of the gas companies, at which the companies were asked to agree on a new deferral of the tariff adjustment. Another agreement to this effect was entered into on that date, freezing US PPI adjustments of tariffs for a two year period while allowing for some increases relating to the earlier deferral and lost income. Income lost as a result of the new deferral was to be gradually recovered and US PPI adjustments were to be reintroduced as from June 30, 2002. Decree No. 669/2000 embodied the new arrangements while recognizing that the US PPI adjustment constituted \"a legitimately acquired right\" and was a basic premise and condition of the tender and the offers.15\n\nDecree No. 669/2000, August 4, 2000, with particular reference to Preambular paragraph 5.\n\n62.\n\nIn a proceeding commenced by the Argentine \"Defensor del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n,\" a federal judge issued on August 18, 2000 an injunction for the suspension of both the agreement and Decree No. 669/2000 pending a decision on the challenged legality of the US PPI adjustment. Meanwhile, administrative appeals made by TGN did not change the situation and TGN's applications for tariff adjustments continued to be rejected. In due course, the companies, the Government and ENARGAS appealed the above decision of the federal judge, however, the appeal was rejected. A final appeal of the companies to the Argentine Supreme Court is still pending.\n\n63.\n\nBased on these developments, ENARGAS repeatedly confirmed the continuing freeze of the US PPI adjustment of tariffs, resulting in no adjustments being made in accordance with this mechanism as from January 1, 2000, that is since the first deferral. The parties disagree on the nature and extent of the decisions adopted by ENARGAS, as will be discussed below. Against these developments, CMS notified its consent to arbitration under ICSID on July 12, 2001, following the required notification of the dispute to the Argentine Government. The dispute at this stage concerned only the issue of the application of the US PPI adjustment.\n\n64.\n\nIn late 2001 the crisis deepened as the corrective measures that Minister Domingo Cavallo had set in train did not succeed. Significant capital flight from Argentina followed. In the wake of these further developments, the Government introduced the \"corralito\" by Decree No. 1570/2001,16 drastically limiting the right to withdraw deposits from bank accounts. Default was declared and several Presidents succeeded one another in office within a matter of days. Emergency Law No. 25,561 was enacted on January 6, 2002,17 declaring a public emergency until December 10, 2003 and introducing a reform of the foreign exchange system. Extensions of this period were later introduced, as will be discussed below.\n\nDecree No. 1570/01, December 3, 2001.\n\nLaw No. 25,561, January 6, 2002 (Emergency Law).\n\n65.\n\nThe Emergency Law introduced the second type of measures that underlie the dispute in the present case. Thus, the currency board which had pegged the peso to the dollar under the 1991 Convertibility Law was abolished, the peso was devalued and different exchange rates were introduced for different transactions. The right of licensees of public utilities to adjust tariffs according to the US PPI was terminated, as was the calculation of tariffs in dollars. The respective tariffs were redenominated in pesos at the rate of one peso to the dollar. The same rate was applied to all private contracts denominated in dollars or other foreign currencies. It was later clarified by Decrees No. 689/2002 and 704/2002, dated May 2, 2002, that the Emergency Law did not apply to gas exports or the tariffs for its transportation, which consequently were exempt from the conversion to pesos.\n\n66.\n\nThe Emergency Law envisaged a process of renegotiation of licenses to be conducted by a Renegotiation Commission. The pertinent procedures were defined by Decree No. 293/2002.18 The renegotiation process began on March 1, 2002 and was later reorganized under other arrangements. Various efforts at initiating an extraordinary review of tariffs or granting small adjustments were blocked by court injunctions. A new Renegotiation Unit was created in 2003 and a new law governing the renegotiation process\u2014Law No. 25,790\u2014 was enacted on October 31, 2003. Renegotiations were to be completed by December 31, 2004. Renegotiation was completed by this date in respect of some public utilities and related companies, but this was not the case in the gas transportation and distribution sector. A witness introduced by the Respondent explained that this was attributable to the inherent difficulty in renegotiating 64 public utility contracts and numerous subcontracts.19\n\nDecree No. 293/02, February 14, 2002.\n\nStatement by Dr. Jorge G. Simeonoff, August 13, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 5, at 1010-1011; Written Witness Statement of Dr. Jorge G. Simeonoff, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder; Alegato Final de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina, September 20, 2004, at 8. All citations to the Argentine Memorials are to the Spanish text.\n\n67.\n\nOn February 13, 2002 CMS notified an ancillary dispute concerning the measures enacted under the Emergency Law and related decisions. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considered that the disputes arising from the one as well as the other types of measures were sufficiently closely related and thus proceeded to the merits phase in respect of both.\n\n*5. CMS's Claim for Business and Financial Losses*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimant explains that it decided to undertake important investments in the gas transportation sector in reliance on the Argentine Government's promises and guarantees, particularly those that offered a real return in dollar terms and the adjustment of tariffs according to the US PPI. The Claimant asserts that it invested almost US$ 175 million in the purchase of shares in TGN and that TGN invested more than US$ 1 billion in the renovation and expansion of the gas pipeline network.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the measures undertaken by the Government in the period 1999 - 2002 and in the aftermath have had devastating consequences. The effects relate in part to the loss of income and in part to the fact that the Claimant's ability to pay its debt has been reduced by a factor of more than three because the debt is denominated in US dollars and there has been an intervening devaluation of the peso. The Claimant also asserts that the value of its shares in TGN has dropped by 92%, falling from US$ 261.1 million to US$ 21.2 million, this last figure having later been revised to US$ 23.7 million and later yet to US$ 17.5 million.20\n\nStatement by Mr. John Wood-Collins, August 16, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 6, at 1336.\n\n70.\n\nBecause no adjustment of tariffs has taken place since January 1, 2000 and because tariffs may no longer be calculated in US dollars, the Claimant explains that TGN's domestic tariff revenue has decreased by nearly 75%. Only export revenues have been kept in US dollars. In the Claimant's view the situation has been aggravated by the assertion by some Provincial governments of the right to pay gas and other invoices in bonds.\n\n71.\n\nIt is further explained that the devaluation has also had an adverse impact on TGN's costs: taking into account an exchange rate of 3.6 pesos to the dollar, the rate used by the Claimant in its Memorial, it now takes 3.6 times as much revenue as before to pay existing debt. As a result, it is claimed, TGN has defaulted on certain dollar-denominated obligations and on its foreign and domestic debt, thus having been excluded from international capital markets. Dollar-denominated operating costs, it is asserted, have also been affected.\n\n72.\n\nIn addition to the losses that CMS has suffered as a result of the specific measures referred to above, the Claimant argues that the broader economic implications of the Emergency Law have led to an artificial depression of consumer gas prices in Argentina, particularly as a result of the tariff freeze. Because Argentine gas prices are among the lowest in the world, an effective subsidy benefiting the rest of the Argentine economy has had a negative impact on the regulated gas sector, amounting to several billion dollars for the energy sector as a whole.\n\n73.\n\nThe end result of these measures, in the Claimant's view, has led to the suspension of investments in new expansion projects and the collapse of the pipeline network. This, in turn, it is argued, has brought about serious gas shortages both in the domestic market and in the supply of neighboring countries, such as Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. A fiduciary fund was established in 2004 to channel investment, in conjunction with private participation, in gas transportation infrastructure, particularly with a view to importing gas from Bolivia to compensate for the domestic shortages. While the Respondent argues that this is evidence of the normal operation of companies and TGN in the gas market, the Claimant is of the view that TGN's participation in this arrangement has not been voluntary.21\n\nStatement by Mr. Bernardo Velar de Irigoyen, August 11, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 3, at 604-605.\n\n*6. The Respondent's Arguments in Respect of Business and Financial Losses*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Government of Argentina argues that the losses incurred by the Claimant are not attributable to the Respondent and that any such losses arise from business decisions of TGN. The effects of the measures on TGN's costs are in the Respondent's view very different from what CMS claims.\n\n75.\n\nThe Government of Argentina asserts first that it is not true that TGN's domestic tariff revenues have decreased by 75%, as argued by the Claimant\u2014a 50% decrease has also been indicated22\u2014in view of the fact that 25%\u2014a figure of 31% has also been mentioned23\u2014of the revenues of TGN are related to export contracts. In this area of operation the pertinent tariffs have been kept in dollars and have increased by 11%\u201412% has also been mentioned24\u2014as a result of the periodic adjustment of such export tariffs in accordance with the US PPI.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 464, 465, with reference to CMS Reply, para. 353. All citations to the Claimant's Memorials are to the English text.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 393.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 394.\n\n76.\n\nMoreover, the exchange rate used in the Claimant's calculations\u20143.6 pesos to the dollar\u2014is in the Respondent's view 20% higher than the actual exchange rate at the time of the Answer (December 2003), or 3 pesos to the dollar. It is further argued that the obligation to accept Provincial bonds in payment has also not caused any harm to TGN as these bonds are used for the payment of taxes and in any event most such bonds have now been recalled.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent argues next that TGN's operating costs in dollars amount to only 26.69% of the revenues denominated in that currency. This, it says, is because part of that revenue is export-related and, moreover, it is to be expected that as a result of the devaluation, the share of dollar denominated operating costs would decrease as a consequence of import substitution. The dollar denominated revenue, it is also asserted, amply compensates for the increase in domestic operating costs in pesos arising from inflation.\n\n78.\n\nA third line of argument of the Argentine Government relates to the choices available to TGN as sources of financing. These ranged from the use of its own capital, debt in pesos\u2014which would not have been affected by a devaluation\u2014, dollar debt in Argentina\u2014 which would have been \"pesified\"\u2014, and finally to foreign currency debt incurred abroad. It is argued in this respect that TGN chose the last option, which held the highest risks. The Respondent holds that the Claimant cannot now attempt to transfer the consequences of this decision to the Government or the consumer.\n\n79.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Gas Law provides for a structure of tariffs that covers only operating costs and excludes financial costs altogether. Tariffs were fixed on the basis of the cost of capital in Argentina and therefore at a level higher than what would have been justified in more stable countries.25\n\nArgentina Answer, paras. 100-110.\n\n80.\n\nIt is furthermore explained that ENARGAS warned TGN about the potential difficulties that could arise from its debt profile26. In fact, the investment prospectus prepared by the Board of TGN in 1995 had specifically warned about the potential adverse effects of a devaluation on revenues, debt payment in foreign currencies and dividends to shareholders.27 The latter document stated that\n\n\"In case of a big devaluation of the peso in respect of the dollar, the patrimonial situation and the operational results of the Company could be adversely affected, as would also be the case of the capacity to make payments in foreign currency (including the repayment of debt expressed in foreign currency) and the distribution of dividends in dollars at acceptable levels.\"28\n\nENARGAS note No. 1906, April 27, 1999, and note No. 3735, September 3, 1999.\n\nTGN Investment Prospectus, July 7, 1995.\n\nCited in Argentina Answer, para. 287.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the License did not guarantee the profitability of the business because, as stated in Article 2.4 of the Basic Rules of the License, \"the Licensor does not guarantee or ensure the profitability of exploitation.\"29 Nor, it is argued, can credit rating deterioration be attributed to the Government. It is further asserted that TGN is free to renegotiate its debt in the international financial market at discounts ranging from 55% to 90%, just as other businesses have done.\n\nArgentina Answer, para. 298.\n\n82.\n\nThe Government of Argentina also asserts that in spite of the Claimant's argument to the effect that TGN invested over US$ 1 billion in infrastructure, the actual situation is that TGN did not comply with the mandatory investment requirement under the License of US$ 40 million and that TGN has repeatedly been fined because of this failure; instead heavy voluntary investments were made in the expansion of the transportation network for exports. A witness for the Respondent stated that TGN has participated actively in the creation and financing of the fiduciary fund for gas transportation mentioned above.30\n\nStatement of Dr. Cristian Folgar, August 12, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 4, at 797-800.\n\n83.\n\nIt will be shown below that the Claimant opposes all such arguments. For now the Tribunal wishes to observe that the Argentine Government has not provided in its memorials an alternative valuation of the eventual losses affecting CMS, saying that it is for the Claimant to properly prove its claims. In this regard the Argentine Minister of Justice explained, at the hearing on the merits, that Argentina was \"not obliged to propose another valuation.\"31 And although the Tribunal requested a clarification on this matter from Argentina's experts, none was provided.32\n\nStatement by Minister Horacio Daniel Rosatti, August 20, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 10, at 2254.\n\nStatement of Dr. Fabian Bello, August 19, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 9, at 1999-2004.\n\n*7. CMS's Legal Justification of its Claims*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant is of the view that the measures adopted by the Argentine Government are in violation of the commitments that the Government made to foreign investors in the offering memoranda, relevant laws and regulations and the License itself.\n\n85.\n\nSuch commitments, it is asserted, included the calculation of tariffs in US dollars, the semi-annual adjustment in accordance with the US PPI and general adjustment of tariffs every five years, all with the purpose of maintaining the real dollar value of the tariffs.33\n\nSee in particular Gas Decree, Article 41.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Argentina further agreed expressly not to freeze the tariff structure or subject it to further regulation or price controls; and that in the event that price controls were introduced, TGN would be entitled to compensation for the difference between the tariff it was entitled to and the tariff actually charged.34 Moreover, the basic rules governing the License could not be altered without TGN's consent.35\n\nLicense, Para. 9.2.\n\nLicense, Para. 18.2.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant is of the view that these guarantees constituted essential conditions for CMS's investment36 and that it has an acquired right to the application of the agreed tariff regime. The Claimant says that the Government of Argentina itself confirmed this in Decree No. 669/2000 by explaining the adjustment mechanism of the licenses as a \"legitimately acquired right.\"37\n\nStatement of Mr. Thomas L.

Miller were prepared on June 10, 2002 and March 16, 2004.\n\nDecree No. 669/2000, August 4, 2000, with particular reference to Preambular paragraph 5.\n\n88.\n\nIt is further argued that the measures adopted are all attributable to the Argentine Government and result in the violation of all the major investment protections owed to CMS under the Treaty. It is claimed in particular that Argentina has wrongfully expropriated CMS's investment without compensation in violation of Article IV of the Treaty; that Argentina has failed to treat CMS's investment in accordance with the standard of fair and equitable treatment of Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty; that the passing of arbitrary and discriminatory measures violates Article II(2)(b); and that it has also failed to observe the many obligations entered into with regard to the investment in violation of the standard of Article II(2)(c) of that Treaty. Unlawful restrictions to the free transfer of funds in violation of Article V of the Treaty were also invoked in the Claimant's memorial, a claim that was later withdrawn.38\n\nCMS Reply, at 58.\n\n89.\n\nOn the basis of its understanding of the measures adopted, their economic impact on the company and the legal violations invoked the Claimant requests compensation in the amount of US$ 261.1 million for Treaty breaches plus interest and costs.\n\n90.\n\nThe specific arguments invoked by the Claimant in support of its legal contentions will be examined by the Tribunal separately when discussing each of the claims made.\n\n*8. The Respondent's Legal Defense*\n-----------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nIn the view of the Argentine Government, the License, and the legal and regulatory framework governing it, provide only for the right of the licensee to a fair and reasonable tariff, encompassing costs of operation, taxes, amortizations, and a reasonable return on investments, but excluding altogether financial costs.39 It is further asserted that no guarantees were offered in respect of convertibility and currency devaluation and the risk inherent to the investment in these respects was expressly brought to the attention of the company.\n\nGas Law, Article 2, Article 38 (a), as discussed in Argentina's Answer, at 56.\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that any consequences arising from CMS's decision to rely on the report of private consultants for its investment strategies cannot be assigned to the Government. That report was not made by the Government and all responsibility for its contents was the subject of an express disclaimer.40\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, at 5-6.\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent argues in addition that, under the Gas Law, transportation and distribution of gas is a national public service which must take into account particular needs of social importance. To this end, the Government is under an obligation to ensure the efficient operation of the service and must control the implementation of the contract, including the alternative of amendment or unilateral termination.41 Thus, the regulation of tariffs is a discretionary power of the Government insofar as it must take social and other public considerations into account.\n\nWith reference to Miguel S. Marienhoff: Tratado de Derecho Administrativo, Vol. II, 1993, Chapter IV; Argentine Supreme Court, *Ra\u00fal Fern\u00e1ndez c/ Poder Ejecutivo Nacional*, Fallos 322:3008 (1999).\n\n94.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, it follows that no commitments could have been made by the Government to maintain a certain economic or exchange rate policy and that the State is free to change such policies, a right which cannot be subject to claims by individuals or corporations. In this respect, the argument follows, CMS could not have ignored the public law of Argentina and the risks involved in investing in that country.\n\n95.\n\nIn this context, it is further asserted, tariffs must ensure to consumers the minimum cost compatible with the certainty of supply,42 as long as the provision of the service is efficient. Because Argentina was characterized by an unstable economy, the tariffs took into account the added risk of investing in that country and were therefore higher than would normally have been the case. As a result profits were also higher.\n\nGas Law, Article 38 (d).\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that the licenses did not contemplate the possibility of convertibility being abandoned and that the contractual regime was therefore incomplete.43 This, the Respondent filled in by means of the pesification in the domestic market and dollarization in the external market, thereby allowing consumers to continue to pay for gas and avoiding the collapse of demand.44 The Respondent also argues that tariffs did take into account the risk of devaluation, a point that will be discussed further below.\n\nArgentina, Post-hearing brief, at 14-15; Witness Written Statement of Dr. Christian Folgar, at 7-9, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor Nouriel Roubini, August 18, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 8, at 1690-1692; Argentina, Post-hearing brief, at 16-17.\n\n97.\n\nAs a result of the above considerations, the Respondent argues that there has been no violation of the commitments made, explaining that the loss of value of CMS's shares is the result of recession and deflation, of a major social and economic crisis and the currency devaluation that followed. This devaluation, it is asserted, had already occurred in other important international financial markets.45 All the measures adopted by the Government, it is further argued, were needed for the normalization of the country and the continuous operation of public services. Had tariffs been adjusted by 300% as CMS would have wanted, public services would have been paralyzed, the income of licensees would have dramatically decreased and public reaction would have been beyond control.46\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, at 199, with reference to the Written Witness Statement of Dr. Jorge Remes Lenicov, para. 30, annexed to the Rejoinder.\n\nWritten Witness Statement of Dr. Jorge Remes Lenicov, explaining the nature and extent of the crisis, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that, in this legal and regulatory context, there could be no violation of the Treaty and objects, in that regard, particularly to the legal claims of CMS. In the Respondent's view, none of the requirements under international law of indirect expropriation are met. The guarantees invoked by CMS are not the property of the company protected under the Treaty and TGN continues to operate normally. Nor was there a violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, or a case of arbitrariness or discrimination. The umbrella clause of the Treaty, the argument follows, cannot be invoked as no obligations were undertaken by Argentina in respect of CMS, only in respect of TGN, and the latter has not made any claim for contractual violation under the License.\n\n99.\n\nIn the alternative, the Republic of Argentina has invoked national emergency, brought about by the above-mentioned economic and social crisis, as grounds for exemption of liability under international law and the Treaty.\n\n100.\n\nAs with the Claimant's arguments, all the views expressed by the Respondent will be discussed in greater detail in connection with each claim.\n\n101.\n\nBefore proceeding any further, however, the Tribunal wishes to address one particular issue raised by the Respondent. The matter concerns the fact that certain loans were granted to TGN by the International Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the World Bank, and the suggestion that this might constitute some form of conflict of interest for an ICSID Tribunal operating under World Bank Group auspices.47\n\nArgentina Opening Statement, August 9, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 1, at 233-234, 302; Argentina Post-hearing brief, August 20, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 10, at 2328-2329.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to state clearly that no connection to this effect has ever interfered with its independent judgment of the case, and it would not permit this to happen. Neither has the Tribunal at any point been approached by World Bank officials on behalf of the IFC or any other Bank affiliate, nor would the Tribunal permit any representation of this kind. The Tribunal learnt about TGN's financing arrangements through the pleadings of the parties alone.\n\n*9. Are the Measures Adopted Temporary or Permanent?*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nOne particular aspect of this dispute is whether the measures adopted are temporary or permanent in nature, a matter that has importance in the context of the applicable law that will be discussed further below.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant rejects that the measures adopted are temporary insofar as they continue to be in force after several years. Moreover, all draft legislation introduced by the Government in Congress has tended to reinforce the effect of such measures. The Claimant invokes as clear evidence of this being the case the draft Public Utilities National Regulatory Act introduced in 2004, in which the measures in force were turned into permanent features of the tariff regime.48\n\nPublic Utilities National Regulatory Act, Draft bill submitted to the Argentine Congress on August 24, 2004, as cited by the CMS Post-hearing brief, at 6-7.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent argues the opposite. In its view, the measures complained of are all of a temporary nature arising from the emergency and subject to renegotiation.49 The Government, it is argued, has made specific proposals to TGN in its efforts to achieve a successful renegotiation, including a proposal made on July 2, 2004, envisaging a 7% increase in tariffs in 2005 and completing their regularization in 2007.50 This has been described as a basic or first proposal.51 It is further stated that the Claimant has not been minded to present any counter-proposal.\n\nStatement of Dr. Eduardo Ratti, August 13, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 5, at 1155-1156; Written Witness Statement of Dr. Eduardo Ratti, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder.\n\nNota UNIREN No. 258/04, July 2, 2004.\n\nStatement by Dr. Jorge G. Simeonoff, August 13, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 5, at 1036-1042.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant explains on this point that the proposal is insufficient to meet the adjustments necessary to achieve a just and reasonable tariff and to compensate for the losses the company has experienced.52 This is particularly so in light of TGN's own January 22, 2003 proposal. Under this proposal, TGN had requested four 17.8% increases to take effect between March and September 2003.53 Such increases would have represented close to a 90% adjustment.\n\nTGN, letter to UNIREN, July 19, 2004; Statement by Dr. Bernardo Velar de Irigoyen, August 11, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 3, at 544-547; Written Witness Statements of Dr. Velar de Irigoyen were prepared on June 13, 2002 and March 16, 2004; Statement by Dr. Francisco A. Mezzadri, August 11, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 3, at 649650; Written Witness Statements were prepared by Dr. Mezzadri on June 4, 2002 and March 12, 2003.\n\nTGN, letter of January 22, 2003 to UNIREN.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal can only note in this respect that more than five years have lapsed since the adoption of the first measures in 2000. Delays can be explained with reference the abovementioned crisis. However, if delays exceed a reasonable period of time the assumption that they might become permanent features of the governing regime gains in likelihood.\n\n*10. Applicable Law: The Parties' Views*\n----------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe parties in this case have not chosen a particular law applicable to the resolution of the dispute nor has the Treaty. In the absence of such choice, Article 42(1) of the Convention becomes the rule governing the determination of the law to be applied by the Tribunal:\n\n\"[I]n the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n109.\n\nYet again the parties have expressed radically different views. The Claimant has argued, first at the jurisdictional stage and again in the merits phase of the proceedings, that only the Treaty and international law are applicable to the dispute while the law of the host State \"plays only a marginal role, relevant only as a matter of fact.\"54 The Claimant argues that ICSID's jurisprudence is uniform in respect of the application of the Treaty as *lex specialis*, complemented by customary international law where necessary.55\n\nCMS Reply, at 59.\n\nCMS Reply, at 60, with reference to *Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Democratic Socialist Republic of* *Sri Lanka* (Case No. ARB/87/3), Final Award of June 27, 1990, 6 *ICSID Rev. \u2014FILJ* 526 (1991); 30 *ILM* 577 (1991);*Int'l Arb. Rep.,* No. 5, at Sec. A (May 1991); 4 *ICSID Rep.* 246 (1997), and other ICSID cases at footnote 277.\n\n110.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant asserts that Argentine law is relevant only in the context of factual matters, such as with regard to the nature of the assurances made to CMS. The Claimant relies in this respect on the decision rendered in the case of *Tecmed v. Mexico* to show that the act of a State must be characterized as internationally wrongful if in breach of an international obligation, \"even if the act does not contravene the State's internal law...\"56\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2) *(Tecmed)*, Award of May 29, 2003, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/laudo-051903%20-English.pdf; 43 *ILM* 133 (2004), para 56.\n\n111.\n\nThe Claimant further explains that, in any event, treaties have a significant place in the Argentine constitutional order and must be observed, and that various courts in Argentina have ruled that some of the measures adopted are themselves unconstitutional.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent has put forth the view that, in the absence of an agreement, the Tribunal must examine and apply the domestic legislation of Argentina, particularly since the investor, like any national investor, is subject to domestic law and the License is specifically governed by Argentine law.\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent invokes first the need to apply the Argentine Constitution. It is explained, in this context, that the protection of the right of property enshrined in the Constitution has been interpreted by the Courts as not having an absolute character and that State intervention in the regulation of individual rights is justified, provided such intervention is both legal and reasonable when factoring in social needs. Moreover, the Respondent asserts that a differentiated treatment in certain circumstances does not affect the requirement of uniformity in the application of the law.\n\n114.\n\nIn respect of the legal regime of treaties in Argentina, the Respondent argues that while treaties override the law they are not above the Constitution and must accord with constitutional public law.57 Only some basic treaties on human rights have been recognized by a 1994 constitutional amendment as having constitutional standing58 and, therefore, in the Respondent's view, stand above ordinary treaties such as investment treaties. It is further argued that, as the economic and social crisis that affected the country compromised basic human rights, no investment treaty could prevail as it would be in violation of such constitutionally recognized rights.\n\nArgentine Constitution, Articles 27, and 75 (22).\n\nGuillermo Barrera Buteler: \"La dignidad de la persona humana como fuente de los derechos fundamentales\", Derecho Constitutional, Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, 2004, 143-156, at 146-147.\n\n*11. Applicable Law: The Tribunal's Findings*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nMuch discussion has surrounded the meaning of Article 42(1) of the Convention and the interpretations have ranged from a restricted application of international law in a complementary or corrective role, to be relied upon only in case of domestic *lacunae* or where the law of the Contracting State is inconsistent with international law,59 to a role that calls for the application of international law only to safeguard principles of *jus cogens*.60\n\n*Kl\u00f6cknerIndustrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais* (Case No. ARB/81/2), *ad hoc* Committee Decision on Annulment of May 3, 1985, 2 *ICSID Rep.* 95 (1994), para. 69; *AMCO Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (Case No. ARB/81/1), *ad hoc* Committee Decision on the Application for Annulment of May 16, 1986, 1 *ICSIDRep.* 509 (1993), at 515; and discussion of both cases by Emmanuel Gaillard and Yas Banifatemi: \"The Meaning of \u2018and' in Article 42(1), Second Sentence, of the Washington Convention: The Role of International Law in the ICSID Choice of Law Process\", 18 *ICSID Review FILJ*375 (2003), at 389-393.\n\nW. M. Reisman: \"The Regime for *Lacunae* in the ICSID Choice of Law Provision and the Question of Its Threshold\", 15 *ICSID Review UU* 362 (2000).\n\n116.\n\nMore recently, however, a more pragmatic and less doctrinaire approach has emerged, allowing for the application of both domestic law and international law if the specific facts of the dispute so justifies. It is no longer the case of one prevailing over the other and excluding it altogether. Rather, both sources have a role to play. The Annulment Committee in *Wena v. Egypt* held in this respect:\n\n\"Some of these views have in common the fact that they are aimed at restricting the role of international law and highlighting that of the law of the host State. Conversely, the view that calls for a broad application of international law aims at restricting the role of the law of the host State. There seems not to be a single answer as to which of these approaches is the correct one. The circumstances of each case may justify one or another solution... What is clear is that the sense and meaning of the negotiations leading to the second sentence of Article 42(1) allowed for both legal orders to have a role. The law of the host State can indeed be applied in conjunction with international law if this is justified. So too international law can be applied by itself if the appropriate rule is found in this other ambit.\"61\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, *ad hoc* Committee Decision on Application for Annulment of February 5, 2002, 41 *ILM* 933 (2002), at 941.\n\n117.\n\nThis is the approach this Tribunal considers justified when taking the facts of the case and the arguments of the parties into account. Indeed, there is here a close interaction between the legislation and the regulations governing the gas privatization, the License and international law, as embodied both in the Treaty and in customary international law. All of these rules are inseparable and will, to the extent justified, be applied by the Tribunal.\n\n118.\n\nIt is also necessary to note that the parties themselves, in spite of their doctrinal differences, have in fact invoked the role of both legal orders. The Republic of Argentina relies for its arguments heavily on provisions of domestic law, but also resorts to international law, for example in respect of treaty clauses on national security and customary law on state of necessity and other matters. Similarly, the Claimant invokes provisions of domestic law, regulations and the License to explain the rights TGN has under these instruments and the measures affecting them. But also the Claimant invokes Treaty guarantees and customary law on various issues.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent has suggested this arbitration might infringe upon or be in conflict with the Constitution of the Republic of Argentina.62 The Tribunal, however, does not believe this to be the case considering the prominent role of treaties under the Constitution and the fact that the arbitration proceeds under both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. In fact, under Article 27 of the Argentine Constitution\n\n\"The federal Government is under the obligation to consolidate its relations of peace and commerce with foreign powers by means of treaties in conformity with the principles of public law provided for under this Constitution.\"\n\nArgentina Opening Statement, August 9, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 1, at 301-302; also Argentina Post-hearing brief, at 24.\n\n120.\n\nSo too, Article 31 of the Constitution mandates that the Constitution, the laws enacted under it and treaties are \"the supreme law of the Nation.\" Indeed, the Argentine courts have a long-standing record of respect for treaties and have duly recognized their hierarchical standing above the law.63 While treaties in theory could collide with the Constitution, in practice this is not very likely as treaties will be scrutinized in detail by both the Government and Congress.\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, Decision in *Ekmekdji\u00e1n v. Sofovich*, July 7, 1992.\n\n121.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal does not find any such collision. First because the Constitution carefully protects the right to property, just as the treaties on human rights do, and secondly because there is no question of affecting fundamental human rights when considering the issues disputed by the parties.\n\n122.\n\nThe specific domestic legislation of Argentina and rules of international law applied by the Tribunal will be discussed in connection with the issues contended. In addition to the Constitution and the Argentine Civil Code, the gas legislation and regulations will be analyzed, together with the measures adopted under the Emergency Law and other pertinent matters. The Treaty and customary international law will also be applied in reaching the pertinent conclusions.\n\n123.\n\nBefore doing so, however, the Tribunal wishes to address a particular contention made by the Respondent, namely that the Tribunal would be exceeding its powers if it were to decide the dispute on the basis of the provisions of the License, and that such decision would be subject to annulment. The Tribunal must apply the relevant domestic and international law, including the License, as a validly made contract under Argentine law and subject to specific stability clauses, since it has a duty to decide the dispute under Article 42(1) of the Convention.\n\n*12. The Limits of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the distinction was made between measures of a general economic nature, such as those concerning the economic and financial emergency, and measures specifically directed to the investment's operation.64 It then reached the following conclusion:\n\n\"...the Tribunal concludes on this point that it does not have jurisdiction over measures of general economic policy adopted by the Republic of Argentina and cannot pass judgment on whether they are right or wrong. The Tribunal also concludes, however, that it has jurisdiction to examine whether specific measures affecting the Claimant's investment or measures of general economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments made to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts.\"65\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003, 42 *ILM* 788 (2003), paras. 25-32.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v*. *Argentine Republic* (Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003, 42 *ILM* 788 (2003), para. 33.\n\n125.\n\nIn discussing the rights of the parties and the measures adopted the Tribunal will keep this distinction in mind.\n\n126.\n\nIt must also be noted that in connection with the merits the Respondent has again raised certain jurisdictional issues that were addressed in the jurisdictional phase of the case, such as the *jus standi* of the Claimant. These issues were decided upon at that stage and will not be reopened in this Award.\n\n*13. Did the Claimant have a Right to a Tariff Calculated in US Dollars?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe first issue the Tribunal must address in connection with the Claimant's contentions is whether it had a right to a tariff calculated in US dollars and converted into pesos at the time of billing.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimant asserts this right under the public tender offer, the Gas Decree, the Information Memorandum issued in 1992 in conjunction with the initial public tender offer, and Clause 9.2 of the License. The Claimant recalls in particular Article 41 of the Gas Decree stipulating that \"tariffs for transportation and distribution shall be calculated in dollars.\"\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent, however, believes differently. As already noted, in the Respondent's view the Gas Law only ensures licensees the right to a fair and reasonable tariff. The Gas Decree and TGN's License do provide for the calculation of tariffs in US dollars and their conversion to pesos but, the Respondent argues, only in conjunction with Convertibility Law No. 23,928. It is further explained that once the convertibility and the dollar/peso parity were abandoned, calculation of tariffs in dollars would become redundant and the right to such calculation would lapse, particularly if a devaluation were to reach 300%. In this regard the Respondent recalls that the Gas Decree refers to the parity established in the Convertibility Law and not to the exchange rate in force at the time of calculation and conversion.66 According to the Respondent, the Government made no promise or guarantee that tariffs would be kept in dollars if the fixed exchange rate regime were abandoned.67\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, at 21, para. 70.\n\nStatement of Dr. Christian Folgar, August 12, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 4, at 744-745; also Argentina post-hearing brief, at 2.\n\n130.\n\nThis relationship between the tariff calculated in US dollars and the Convertibility Law is also discussed by the Respondent in the context of the privatization of the telephone company. In that situation tariffs were originally calculated in local currency and adjusted in accordance with Argentina's consumer price index. The tariffs were later converted into dollars and subjected to dollar adjustment but only as a result of the Convertibility Law, presumably for as long as this law was in force. It has been explained by the Claimant, however, that this was a different situation and that, in its view, it further confirms that tariffs were to be calculated in dollars.68\n\nCMS Opening Statement, August 9, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 1, at 20-24.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent has also elaborated on the question of the applicable law in the context of this issue, arguing in particular that the Claimant could not have made its investment exclusively on the basis of the public tender offer or the Information Memorandum of 1992, as both were subject to the express provisions of Argentine law and the specific terms of the arrangements for the transfer of TGN's shares. It is also emphasized, as noted, that the information provided by consultant firms was expressly subject to a disclaimer, that no assurance was offered on the part of the Government and that no liability could ensue from the information contained therein.\n\n132.\n\nAny such decision to invest, the argument follows, could only have been made on the basis of the applicable rules in force. As the Gas Law only ensured the right to a fair and reasonable tariff, none of the instruments which were subordinate to it, in particular the License, could validly provide for additional rights. This would breach the principle of legality and the very right of the State to fix the tariffs for its public services and modify contracts in consideration of public interest. Moreover, the Respondent again raises an argument to the effect that the Claimant in any event cannot rely on TGN's License as this was issued to a different company; this, as noted, is an issue that has been resolved by the Tribunal in its jurisdictional decision.\n\n133.\n\nWhile it is true that the Claimant at first relied heavily for its arguments on the Information Memorandum and related consultant reports, the entire legal structure was gradually brought into the pleadings by both parties. This included the Gas Law which contains provisions of a general nature, such as the right to a fair and reasonable tariff, as well as the Gas Decree and the License which specifically provide for the calculation of tariffs in dollars and their conversion into pesos at the time of billing. This guarantee is sufficient to legally give rise to a right of the Claimant to this effect. It is not contrary to the law. Neither is it contrary to the right of the State to amend tariffs, for which purpose specific mechanisms were established in the License itself and other relevant instruments.\n\n134.\n\nIn addition, in the context of the privatization it was abundantly clear that one of the key elements in attracting foreign investment and in overcoming the economic and financial crisis of the late 1980's was to provide the necessary stability. Declarations by public officials repeatedly confirmed this understanding and the Memorandum, while not legally binding, accurately reflects the views and intentions of the Government. This very same understanding, as the Claimant has emphasized, was expressly confirmed by the Privatization Committee, a step that must be considered as having some legal implications.\n\n135.\n\nThis Committee in fact recorded in the minutes of its session of October 2, 1992, that \"Section 9.2 leaves it sufficiently clear that the tariffs are in dollars and expressed in convertible pesos, for which reason, when faced with an eventual modification of the Convertibility Law, they should be automatically re-expressed at the modified rate.\"69\n\nCommittee on the Privatization of Gas del Estado. Minutes of the meeting held on October 2, 1992, Section 2; also CMS post-hearing brief, at 2-3.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced of the merits of the argument the Respondent has made about the right to a tariff calculation in dollars linked to the Convertibility law. Had the right been conditioned on the existing parity the pertinent provisions could have said so quite clearly. This was not the case and the Privatization Committee understood the guarantee differently, that is, as providing for a tariff in a stable currency. In fact, the provisions in question allow for a reading which is quite different from that argued by the Respondent. If the tariffs were in dollars and had parity changed at the time of billing, the conversion was to be made at the rate of exchange at that moment so as to, precisely, guarantee the fairness and reasonableness of the return. This, however, is an argument linked more to the question of devaluation and it will be examined further below.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that it was precisely because the right to tariff calculations in dollars was guaranteed that the privatization program was as successful as it was. The program attracted hundreds of companies to the country with investments that ran into over 10 billion dollars. Numerous bilateral investment treaties were also entered into at the time to provide additional guarantees under international law. It is not credible that so many companies and governments and their phalanxes of lawyers could have misunderstood the meaning of the guarantees offered in a manner that allowed for their reversal within a few years.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes on this question that the Claimant has convincingly established that it has a right to a tariff calculated in dollars and converted into pesos at the time of billing. The specific implications of this finding will be discussed below.\n\n*14. Did the Claimant have a Right to Adjustment of Tariffs in Accordance with the US PPI?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe second element that was determinative for the Claimant in deciding to invest in TGN was the assurance of adjustments of the tariff in accordance with the US PPI in January and July of each year. This right, in the Claimant's view, was created by the Gas Law and every other instrument governing the privatization of the gas transportation and distribution industry.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent makes in this connection the same arguments as those advanced above in respect of the calculation of the tariff in dollars. In the Respondent's view, such mechanism was justified only in conjunction with the Convertibility Law and the exchange rate parity, thus avoiding indexation in accordance with Argentine indexation mechanisms and taking advantage of the fact that inflation in the United States was historically lower than that reflected in Argentine indexes.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that such adjustment mechanism was justified at the time of privatization in 1992, but that at the end of the decade it had lost all relevance because the Argentine economy went into recession and deflation and domestic prices fell significantly. It is also argued that the United States' inflation at the time was higher than what it had been historically and that the adjustment would therefore no longer reflect TGN's costs but would result in a significant increase of tariffs during the recession. The Respondent held that such increase could be as high as 6.18% resulting from the US PPI adjustment plus some adjustments due to debt repayment.\n\n142.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's argument this was the situation underlying the voluntary postponement of adjustments agreed to in January and July 2000. These were also the reasons invoked by the Federal judge issuing the injunction on adjustments referred to above.\n\n143.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent believes that the freezing of tariffs at this point was the measure affecting the licensees the least as resorting to an extraordinary adjustment of tariffs would have led to yet lower tariffs.\n\n144.\n\nThe same considerations the Tribunal made above in respect of the meaning of the governing legal framework, including the question of the dependence on the Convertibility Law, apply to the issue of adjustment of tariffs in accordance with the US PPI; that is, it was a right established under the legal rules, the License and the context in which the privatization was undertaken. The Claimant has adequately proven its rights concerning this other issue. The question of costs and whether the mechanism was justified at a later point will be discussed separately.\n\n*15. Did the Claimant have a Right to Stabilization Mechanisms under the License?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nA third issue the Tribunal must examine is whether the Claimant had a right under the governing legal framework to additional stabilization clauses. The Claimant invokes in particular two such clauses of the License. The first concerns the Respondent's commitment in clause 9.8 of the License to the effect that the tariff structure would not be frozen or subject to further regulation or price control, and that in the event that a price control mechanism compelled the licensee to adjust to a lower level of tariff \".the Licensee shall be entitled to an equivalent amount in compensation to be paid by the Grantor.\"70\n\nDecree No. 2457/92, Basic Rules Governing the License, Clause 9.8.\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimant next invokes Clause 18.2 of the License which provided that the basic rules governing the License would not be amended, totally or partially, without the Licensee's written consent. The Claimant further asserts that when such consent was given in January and July 2000 for the postponement and rescheduling of adjustments, albeit nonvoluntarily in the Claimant's view, the Argentine Government undertook additional obligations to reestablish the operation of the altered adjustment mechanisms.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimant argues that all the commitments under the License as well as the 2000 postponement arrangements were simply not observed by the Argentine Government. Moreover, in the Claimant's view, ENARGAS further aggravated the situation by adopting decisions that went beyond the extent of the judicial injunction. It is argued in particular that the injunction affected only the July agreement and the corresponding Decree No. 669/00,71 but not the January agreement under which a 6% adjustment would be made in July 2000.\n\nDecree No. 669/2000, approving Act No. 2 on the July 2000 postponement.\n\n148.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, there is yet again a jurisdictional question in that any stabilization clause would benefit TGN as the licensee but not the Claimant, a matter on which, as explained, the Tribunal has already ruled. It is further believed on the merits of the question that the Government powers could not be subject to a freeze as this would be equivalent to a renunciation prohibited under the law and the constitutional concept of public service.\n\n149.\n\nIn respect of the argument about aggravating measures adopted in 2000, the Respondent asserts that ENARGAS was only following a judicial determination and it was on this basis that it rejected an administrative appeal by TGN purporting to have the January adjustment enforced. Yet later it rejected the tariff application by TGN seeking to retroactively obtain the adjustments corresponding to the year 2000 and to follow on as from 2001.\n\n150.\n\nOn this last question, the Tribunal considers the argument made by the Argentine Government as pertinent because, even though technically a restrictive interpretation of the injunction might have been correct, it was quite evident that such injunction was aimed at paralyzing the operation of the adjustments as a whole and not just that corresponding to the July agreement.\n\n151.\n\nThe important question, however, is that concerning the right to benefit from stabilization clauses. This discussion is well known in international law and to the extent this dispute concerns the simultaneous operation of the License and protection under the Treaty, the stabilization ensured a right that the Claimant can properly invoke.72\n\nRosalyn Higgins: \"The Taking of Property by the State: Recent Developments in International Law\", Recueil des Cours de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Droit International, Vol. 176, 1982-III, 259.\n\n*16. Was the Economic Balance of the License Altered in Light of Changing Realities?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nWhile the legal meaning of the governing legal framework and the License is quite straightforward and granted rights that are now invoked by the Claimant, the reality of the Argentine economy is more difficult to assess. It may be recalled that the privatization program was conceived to overcome the crisis of the late 1980's. This crisis was characterized by hyper inflation, the inefficient operation of many publicly-owned companies, including those responsible for public utilities, and a dramatic shortage of investments. The privatization program was very successful but the late 1990's witnessed the emergence of another major crisis.\n\n153.\n\nThis crisis will be discussed further below, but it should be mentioned at this point that it stemmed basically from economic conditions that made it impossible to maintain the fixed exchange rate and which gradually led to the greatest default on foreign debt in history and the collapse of the Argentine financial markets. Some tend to fault foreign investors and put the blame on excessive privatization and globalization, while others see in it the result of not having carried out the liberalization program in its entirety and having allowed major governmental interferences in the functioning of the economy.\n\n154.\n\nJustice, however, is not as blind as it is often thought and this Tribunal acknowledges that changing realities had an impact on the operation of the industry and the governing legal and contractual arrangements.\n\n155.\n\nThe first major impact arose from the devaluation of the peso. The measures adopted in 2000 in order to postpone US PPI adjustments and to freeze the tariffs were in fact anticipating a major upheaval in the economy and in the economic policies followed by the Argentine Government. The Emergency Law and related measures came to confirm this situation and transformed the freeze into a permanent feature of that policy coupled with the elimination of the Convertibility Board and the exchange rate parity.\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent has argued in this respect, first, that the privatization framework never guaranteed that a devaluation would not occur and, next, that the Board of TGN expressly warned in the Investment Prospectus that there were no assurances that changes in government policy would not affect the company. Particular reference was made to inflation, monetary fluctuations, interest rates, social instability and political events.73 Along the same lines, the Respondent argues that witnesses introduced by the Claimant have recognized that there was no assurance against devaluation.74\n\nArgentina Answer, at 44, with reference to TGN's Public Offer of July, 1995, which devotes a Section to Convertibility and exchange rate risks.\n\nArgentina Post-hearing brief, at 2-4, with reference to the Statement by Dr. Patricio Carlos Perkins, August 10, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 2, at 396; and the Statement of Dr. Bernardo Velar de Irigoyen, August 11, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 3, at 552.\n\n157.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Claimant cannot pretend that it had a right never to see the returns of the company diminish for reasons other than business risks. The Respondent observes that this would transform the License into the kind of insurance policy which this Tribunal and other tribunals have held are not provided by bilateral investment treaties. Moreover, the Respondent asserts, the Claimant cannot pretend to be insulated from any internal or external condition affecting the operation of the company.\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimant explains that it does not complain about the economic conditions of Argentina or the right of the Government to devalue the currency, but only about the breach of the specific guarantees offered to investors and the related protection ensured under the Treaty. One of the most significant guarantees in this respect, in the Claimant's view, was that of keeping the tariffs in dollars so as to eliminate monetary and devaluation risks.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted above that it is not its task to pass judgment on the economic policies adopted by Argentina and hence it is not for it to determine whether the devaluation was the right or the wrong measure to take in the circumstances. However, it is its duty to establish whether such measure had specific adverse consequences for the Claimant in light of the legal commitments made by Argentina both under the applicable domestic and international legal framework.\n\n160.\n\nHere again the discussion about the connection between the calculation of tariffs and their periodic adjustment in dollars and the Convertibility Law becomes crucial to determine the issue. As noted above, two different views have been expressed on this point. For the Respondent, that guarantee only stands as long as the Convertibility Law and the exchange rate parity was in force. For the Claimant, the guarantee works precisely in the context of an alteration of the exchange rate, as the tariffs would still be calculated in dollars and converted into pesos at the newly established exchange rate.\n\n161.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal is of the view that the meaning of the legal framework and the License, particularly in the context of the privatization, was to guarantee the stability of the tariff structure and the role the calculation in dollars and the US PPI adjustment played therein. Devaluation could of course happen at some point, but then the tariff structure would remain intact within the framework of stability envisaged as it would adjust automatically to the new level of the exchange rate.\n\n162.\n\nThe fact that tariffs were converted from dollars to pesos at a fixed exchange rate of 1 to 1 and that, at the same time, the devaluation was undertaken, meant that the stabilization envisaged in the License was in practice eliminated.\n\n163.\n\nThe discussions held in this respect in the Privatization Committee, referred to above, are helpful to clarify the real meaning of the guarantees provided. It is reasonable to understand this discussion as having concluded that there was no need to repeat in the License a guarantee that was already provided under the law, as opposed to an agreement to abandon a fundamental guarantee of this kind. The latter option would be entirely contradictory to the intent of the contemporaneous privatization program and the interest in attracting foreign investment.\n\n164.\n\nAgain, on this issue, the law is clear, but economic realities are indeed more complex to assess. For one thing, it is quite true that, as argued by the Respondent, the peso had already been much devalued in international markets and hence it was entirely artificial to keep it at a parity that was no longer sustainable.75 For another, capital flight had reached critical proportions as a consequence of a drop in exchange rates and general lack of trust in the economic conditions. In this regard, the change of policy became inevitable.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor Nouriel Roubini, August 18, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 8, at 1681-1684; Argentina, Post-hearing brief, at 5.\n\n165.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is then how does one weigh the significance of a legal guarantee in the context of a collapsing economic situation. It is certainly not an option to ignore the guarantee, as the Respondent has advocated and done, but neither is it an option to disregard the economic reality which underpinned the operation of the industry.\n\n166.\n\nThe answer to this conundrum lies in the examination of the effect of the economic situation on the costs of the company, including the question of cost structure, the significance of the export market and the adjustment mechanisms provided for under the License.\n\n*17. A Fair and Reasonable Tariff*\n----------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nOne of the few points on which the parties seem to be in agreement is that tariffs should be fair and reasonable as envisaged under the governing legal regime. Yet, what is fair and reasonable is the subject of substantial disagreement.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent has made the argument that tariffs that were kept and adjusted in dollars could not be fair and reasonable in the context of the recession and deflation that affected Argentina. This was particularly so, in the Respondent's view, because internal prices kept falling in the wake of the currency devaluation and hence the costs of the company were greatly diminished, a consequence to which a dollar standard could not adjust. Hence the decisions to abandon the dollar denomination and to freeze the tariffs.\n\n169.\n\nThe Claimant has explained in this respect that its operating costs did in fact decrease as a result of the devaluation from US$ 70.3 million in 2001 to US$ 37.2 million in 2002. However, during the same period revenue decreased from US$ 253 in 2001 to US$ 125.1 million in 2002. The end result was that operating income fell by 52% in one year. In the Claimant's view, the devaluation did not necessarily lead to a reduction in costs as many expenses remained fixed in dollars and local suppliers quickly adjusted their prices to compensate for the devaluation.\n\n170.\n\nAs a matter of principle, a devaluation of 300% must necessarily have an effect on the company cost structure. However, costs are unlikely to decrease in the same proportion, in part because some costs are kept in dollars and in part because financial costs must also be considered, not just operating costs. This issue has resulted in disagreement between the parties.\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimant has explained that its financial costs are reasonable for a capitalintensive infrastructure industry. TGN financed about one half of its investment by debt to be amortized over the life of the project. The total debt of TGN, both domestic and external, amounts to US$ 590 million, of which 93% corresponds to foreign loans and remains payable in dollars. Only 7% of TGN's debt, that is the domestic portion, was pesified. As a result of the tariff freeze, TGN has defaulted on all its loans and has ceased to repay capital, paying approximately only one-third of the interest due.\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimant has also explained that higher debt resulted in lower capital costs and thus in maximum efficiency. This, in its view, was the very reason that led ENARGAS to use TGN's leverage of 46% debt to 54% equity in the estimates preparatory to the second tariff review, which never took place.76\n\nCMS Post-hearing brief, at 5, with reference to ENARGAS Note 5498 and the calculation of the cost of capital for the second five-year review, November 13, 2001, Annex I.\n\n173.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, such financial decisions are attributable only to the company, as discussed above. In fact, the Government of Argentina believes that TGN, in relying on foreign debt, chose the worst of all financial options to the detriment of other alternatives, such as the use of its own capital or debt in Argentina, in pesos or even in dollars, which was later pesified.77 It follows, in the Respondent's view, that the risk entailed in this decision cannot now be attributed to Argentina and that, in any event, such proportion of debt was unwise and the company was so warned by ENARGAS. The Respondent explains that TGN increased its debt-equity ratio from approximately 0.50 in 1997 to over 1.00 in 2001; had TGN's ratio been used in calculating tariffs, these would have been lower, not higher, because the rate of return required would also have been lower.78\n\nStatement of Dr. Christian Folgar, August 12, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 4, at 748-757; Expert Statement by Dr. Fabian Bello, August 19, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 9, at 1958-1967; Written Expert Report of Dr. Fabian Bello, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder.\n\nArgentina Reply, at 66-68. Expert Statement by Dr. Fabian Bello, August 19, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 9, at 19641967.\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimant believes differently. It could not borrow on the domestic capital market as it did not have capacity to absorb large borrowing. Moreover, no one could have foreseen that devaluation and decoupling of tariffs from dollars would be forthcoming as all the guarantees offered pointed in the opposite direction. Thus, at the time it made sense to borrow in international markets thereby taking advantage of low interest rates.\n\n175.\n\nAs to the discussion about the debt-equity ratio, the Claimant also explains that a 62% debt to total capital is standard in the gas industry, and thus a 50% ratio as that of TGN is perfectly reasonable, particularly when taking into account the stability surrounding the approval of the project. Furthermore, it is explained that the initial tariffs were calculated by the Government on a 33:67 debt to equity ratio, allowing for a lower cost of capital and higher bidding for the licenses.\n\n176.\n\nA related point of contention is that while the Respondent argues that the company opted to distribute profits to shareholders instead of reinvesting it, and thus failed to increase its own capital contribution as opposed to having financed debt, the Claimant asserts that this is simply patently erroneous as 70% of its profits were reinvested and merely US$ 168 million paid in dividends, a figure representing only a 4% annual return.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimant is also of the view that debt restructuring as a mitigating alternative mentioned in Argentina's argument is simply not possible because creditors are not in a position at present to forecast companies' revenues. The difficulty experienced by the very Government of Argentina in restructuring its foreign debt proves in the Claimant's view that the exercise was not easy to carry out, and even less so could this be done by way of reorganization under the aegis of Argentine courts.\n\n178.\n\nThe conclusion of this discussion calls for a determination of whether financial costs are a factor in the calculation of tariffs so as to reach the fair and reasonable result mandated by the Law. In Respondent's view, it is not. In the Claimant's view, it is an essential factor.\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that financial costs are included as an element of the calculation of tariffs. This is so, first, because no project of this magnitude could be carried out without its financing being calculated within the return necessary to make it viable. Second, the legal meaning of the Gas Law unequivocally leads to the same conclusion. Indeed, Article 38(a) of the Law provides that the service providers who operate economically and prudently shall have \"the opportunity of obtaining an income sufficient to recover all reasonable operating costs applicable to the service, taxes, depreciation (\"amortization\" in Spanish) and a reasonable rate of return...\". So too Article 2(4) of the Gas Decree provides for the recovery of all reasonable costs \"including the cost of capital.\"\n\n180.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view it is quite clear that \"depreciation\" or \"amortizacion\" refers, in particular, to the debt financing which is written off over the years. There is yet a another reason supporting this conclusion. Debt was a part of the tariff as calculated before the freeze and it is quite unlikely that the Government and the regulatory agency, as well as all the companies, would have read the Law mistakenly. Neither is there any reason to believe that experienced companies would not have operated economically and prudently.\n\n181.\n\nIt follows that the freeze adopted cannot be reconciled with the objective of a fair and reasonable tariff, not just because of the dollar connection and adjustment discussed above, but also because, by not taking into account the financial reality of the project, such frozen tariffs do not reflect the real costs of the operator. This is why financial costs were taken into account by ENARGAS both in the first and the second five-year tariff review, even if the latter was never finalized. Presumably this was also reflected in the Government's 2000 tariff increases, which were subject to the court injunction, and might also be included in the new increases that government officials have repeatedly assured are a necessary step under the renogotiation process.\n\n182.\n\nThe effects of the devaluation have quite evidently given rise to profound adjustments in the economy of Argentina, but not all such effects have benefited the operator. Far from it: the combined effect of tariff freezes and devaluation, even if the latter resulted in a decrease of operating costs, led to the evaporation of operating income, prompted constant negative results in the balance sheet and caused the default mentioned. A tariff causing these results cannot be judged under any standard to be fair and reasonable.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot rule out the argument that a tariff kept and adjusted in dollars might be unrealistic in view of the changing economic realities that have been mentioned. But, even within the context of the Argentine legal framework and the License itself, there are ways to take these changes into account without abandoning the legal guarantees offered, as will be discussed further below.\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent has argued in addition that the tariffs were higher than normal because they took into account, from the outset, the risk of devaluation expressed in terms of the Argentine country-risk. To this end, the discount rate used was also higher so as to allow for a greater return to the company because of that risk (\"WACC\" or Weighted Average Cost of Capital), as was also the case with the interest rate. The Stone & Webster consultant report commissioned by ENARGAS in order to make the first five-year review of tariffs had suggested a rate of return of 18.6% on the capital contributed by the company. This was eventually established by the regulatory agency as a 16.07% rate of return, thus reflecting, in the Respondent's view, the effect of the higher country-risk.\n\n185.\n\nWhile this discussion is related more to the question of valuation of damages and the determination of the value of the company made by the Claimant's financial experts, which will be examined separately, it nonetheless reveals an important feature of the tariff regime that, it is argued, did provide for protection against devaluation. While, in the Claimant's view, this protection was a part of the legal promises and assurances given, it appears in the Respondent's view that it was given by means of the financial mechanisms put in place, particularly the tariff. These arguments, it will be seen, have important legal implications.\n\n186.\n\nIt follows that the devaluation must not only be considered as a part of the broad economic measures affecting the country as a whole but also as a specific feature applicable to the Claimant and having a direct impact on its operations. As such and to that extent, it falls under the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Tribunal has noted above that the devaluation indeed did have an adverse economic effect on the operator because, in conjunction with other measures, it resulted in a tariff that was not fair and reasonable.\n\n187.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant also explains, the distortions this situation has created are at the very heart of the crisis of the energy sector affecting Argentina. It is further asserted that artificially low tariffs led to an increased demand and, as revenues are insufficient to make further investments in transportation and distribution, the energy market has collapsed and has required new and different arrangements, including the fiduciary fund mentioned above and the importation of gas from Bolivia at high costs.79 On this basis, the argument about subsidization of other sectors of the economy becomes convincing.\n\nCMS Reply, at 7.\n\n*18. Investments and Exports*\n-----------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThere is yet another element of the discussion relevant to the correct understanding of the cost structure and the implications of devaluation and pesification: the investment program and its connection with the export market.\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that three kinds of investment were made: US$ 40 million of mandatory investment, principally related to the improvement of safety and network integrity; US$ 12 million of non-mandatory investment destined for expansion; and US$ 29.5 million for projects aimed at strengthening efficiency. Not only were these goals achieved, the argument goes on, but TGN made investments exceeding US$ 1 billion that resulted in significant network expansion and distribution to many new users while keeping the gas price among the lowest in the world.80\n\nStatement by Dr. Francisco A. Mezzadri, August 11, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 3, at 654-660.\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent challenges these assertions and argues that investment targets were not met and that, as a consequence, the Claimant was fined repeatedly and the posting of security required. In Respondent's view, most of the investments made were related to the expansion of transportation networks for export markets. These investments were additional to what was envisaged in the License, the sole purpose of which was the supply of the domestic market and not the international market. This point, however, is also disputed by the Claimant.\n\n191.\n\nTariffs for the export market, as explained above, after the initial clarifications of the measures adopted, have been kept in US dollars and adjusted in accordance with the US PPI. About a fourth of TGN's revenues, the Respondent explains, originate in exports and this, in its view, is an amount sufficient to cover all the costs of the Claimant, including those related to the domestic market and financial costs. Moreover, the Respondent has further asserted, that the export tariffs are \"excessive.\"81\n\nArgentina Answer, at 250.\n\n192.\n\nClarification of the question became necessary when several Chilean importers of gas began making payments in pesified tariffs.82 A later request by the Chilean company Colbun, also an importer of gas, to the effect that export tariffs should not be kept in dollars or adjusted in accordance with the US PPI, was turned down by governmental decree in Argentina.83\n\nCMS Memorial, at 53.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, at 89, 140, with reference to Colbun's S. A., Complaint introduced before ENARGAS on February 5, 2003; and ENARGAS Decree No. 2812, March 25, 2003, rejecting the complaint. Colbun later requested judicial intervention and protective measures, rejected by the competent Appeals Court on September 22, 2003. Both Colbun (Courbis to TGN, letter of June 29, 2004) and Metrogas (Morand\u00e9 to TGN, letter of July 14, 2004) complained about the terms and conditions of the supply of gas to those companies.\n\n193.\n\nThe discussion does not end there since the Claimant explains that of the US$ 1 billion invested only US$ 271 million were related to export sales, which under the Gas Law, was to be carried out under terms similar to those governing the domestic business. According to the Claimant, Argentina derives many important benefits from this export activity. Finally, the question of fines and security, it is also argued, was raised in a context of political confrontation unrelated to the real facts.\n\n194.\n\nBut even when taking into account the positive influence of exports on the company's revenues, the Claimant argues, the end result has been that overall revenues have been insufficient to cover operating and other costs and that this shortfall is shown in expert reports which include export revenues.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that the required investments were made and indeed exceeded by far; it is also persuaded that the export markets have somewhat compensated for revenue shortfalls. However, the compensating effect of export revenues has not fully redressed a situation which carries the heavy burden of the measures in force affecting the domestic market. This situation amplifies the cross-subsidizing effects of the measures adopted in the Argentine economy.\n\n*19. Duration of the License*\n-----------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe parties have also disputed another aspect relevant for the determination of rights and obligations under the contract: the duration of the License.\n\n197.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, TGN is entitled to an extension of the license beyond the initial period of 35 years ending in 2027. This extension would, under the terms of the License, be for an additional ten years, ending in 2037. The Respondent believes, to the contrary, that the License does not entail a right of automatic renewal and is subject to performance requirements that have not been met by the Claimant, as well as to other conditions set forth in Clause 3.2 of the License.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the License provides for the right to an additional ten-year extension, but that this right is subject to the compliance with performance requirements, and has to be requested by the licensee and approved by the Government. A discussion about performance requirements is unnecessary for the Tribunal to reach a conclusion on this aspect of the dispute.\n\n199.\n\nIndeed, the License is very clear about the fact that this right is conditional and subject to a number of steps, both substantive and procedural, which might or might not take place. As it would be impossible to establish at present whether these conditions might be met, the Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent's argument to the effect that no damages should be considered beyond the year 2027. This will therefore be the year which the Tribunal will rely on for its determination of damages.\n\n*20. Discussion of Legal and Contractual Obligations under Argentine Law*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nIn view of the conclusions reached by the Tribunal on the question of applicable law it must now examine the effect of the measures with reference to Argentine law and the contracts involved in this dispute.\n\n201.\n\nThe fundamental legal principle guaranteeing the right to property is established in Article 17 of the Constitution which provides that\n\n\"The right to property is inviolable and no inhabitant of the Nation can be deprived of it except by a judicial decision founded in the law.\"\n\n202.\n\nThe exercise of this basic guarantee, like other fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, is regulated under the law, as indicated in Article 14, but cannot be altered by that law, as expressly mandated by Article 28 of the Constitution. Indeed, this Article mandates that \"the principles, guarantees and rights recognized in the preceding articles shall not be altered by the laws regulating their exercise.\"\n\n203.\n\nThe argument made by the Respondent to the effect that such guarantees are not absolute and are subject to the requirements of social needs and public interest is indeed correct,84 but this does not contradict the central role of the right to property and the obligation to pay compensation in case of government interference with its exercise.\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, *Ercolano c. Lanteri*, Fallo 136:161 (1922).\n\n204.\n\nArticle 42 of the Constitution has occasionally been invoked as an example of the social needs restricting rights to property, in that this provision recognizes the right of consumers and users of goods and services to the protection of health, safety and economic interests, adequate and truthful information, freedom of choice and equitable and dignified treatment. This particular legitimate objective, pertains, however, to so-called third generation rights and is embodied in a separate chapter of the Constitution referring to new rights. To this extent such rights should be viewed as future aspirations rather than enforceable rights similar to fundamental constitutional rights.\n\n205.\n\nThe basic principle of Argentine law governing contracts and the ensuing obligations is contained in Article 1197 of the Civil Code which provides:\n\n\"Conventions made in contracts constitute for the parties a rule that must be observed as the law.\"85\n\nArgentine Civil Code, Article 1197.\n\n206.\n\nThis principle is in harmony with the rights protected under the Constitution. There is indeed a long-standing tradition of Argentine court decisions and the writings of distinguished jurists highlighting the importance of the faithful enforcement of contracts as the expression of the will of the parties.86 There is also the view, however, that the State has the duty to intervene under the law stipulated in the contract so as to redress possible imbalances.87 Here again the law does not ignore social needs but makes them subject to very precise conditions and requirements. Thus, the need to ensure stability remains a basic concern and any departure therefrom must be in the form of a clearly established legal justification.\n\nGuillermo A. Borda: Tratado de Derecho Civil, 1971; Obligaciones, 1989.\n\nRub\u00e9n S. Stiglitz: Contratos Civiles y Comerciales, 1998, at 503-505.\n\n207.\n\nThese various points of view underlie the legal arguments made by the parties in this dispute. The Claimant has argued that there are a number of rights, both under the law and under the contract, with particular reference to the License, that have not been observed by the Respondent and these legal obligations should be given full effect. The Respondent, however, is of the view that if the parties had wished to contract in dollars they could have done so explicitly under Article 1197 of the Civil Code, but they chose instead to contract by reference to the Convertibility Law.88 It is also argued that even if the Gas Decree and the License had referred to a dollar-related tariff, these instruments could not contradict the Law which itself did not refer to this standard. In any event, the Respondent asserts, the economic conditions of the crisis necessarily resulted in the change of the terms of the contract.\n\nArgentina Opening Statement, August 9, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 1, at 210-219.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal must note in this respect that the fact that the Gas Law did not refer explicitly to the dollar-based tariff cannot be taken to mean that this standard was not a part of the legal and contractual commitments made to the investor. It was very much part of those undertakings as the legal and contractual framework of the privatization amply evidences. There is thus no contradiction between the law, the regulations and the contract and the latter could only be ignored had it constituted an undertaking prohibited by law, which is not the case here.\n\n209.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the regulations and the contract provided for tariffs in dollars is consistent with Article 619 of the Civil Code to the extent that it provides that the obligation to pay a sum in a particular currency is satisfied when payment is made in the stipulated currency at the time it becomes due. This article amended a prior reference to payment in national currency.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal has stated above, however, that parallel to legally enforceable obligations arising from the commitments and assurances that Argentina gave in the privatization process, there have been inescapable economic realities that cannot be ignored.\n\n211.\n\nThere is broad agreement on the fact that Argentina was affected by a deep crisis of an economic, social and political nature. The downturn in the economy commencing in 1999, the rising levels of poverty and the rapid turnover of politicians occupying the highest offices in the nation, coupled with social upheaval and civil disobedience, was a dramatic reality. Witness statements introduced by the Respondent both in writing and in the oral hearing were eloquent in this respect.89 These developments have been deplored by the Claimant. Needless to say, also the Tribunal has the greatest sympathy for the plight of the Argentine people under the circumstances and respects its efforts to overcome the situation.\n\nStatement by Dr. Carmelo Angulo Barturen, August 13, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 5, at 1189 et seq.; and Written Witness Statement of June 24, 2004, attached to Argentina Rejoinder; Vivian Foster: \"Impacto Social de la Crisis Argentina en los Sectores de Infraestructura\", World Bank Office for Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, Documento de Trabajo No. 5/03, April 2003, Annex V to Written Witness Statement of Dr. Christian Folgar, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder; Written Witness Statement of Mrs. Angela Cristina Calvo, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder; Expert publication of Equis, Investigaci\u00f3n Social: \"La Crisis Argentina\", June 2004, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder.\n\n212.\n\nThe issue for the Tribunal to establish is whether, under Argentine law, there is any valid excuse for not complying with the terms of the contractual and legal arrangements Argentina had entered into.\n\n213.\n\nThe Argentine Government has invoked in the alternative the existence of a state of necessity under international law as an exemption from liability. The state of international law on this question will be examined separately.\n\n214.\n\nUnder domestic law, the state of necessity is not recognized by the Argentine Civil Code or the law generally.90 A number of court decisions, however, have from time to time relied on the state of economic emergency to the extent it had been declared by Congress, provided it was temporary and reasonable.91\n\nRub\u00e9n H. Compagnucci de Caso: Manual de Obligaciones, 1997, at 209.\n\nRub\u00e9n S. Stiglitz: Contratos Civiles y Comerciales, 1998, at 28-30.\n\n215.\n\nIn the context of the current Emergency Law, the Supreme Court, relying on the provisions of the Constitution, has emphasized, in addition to those requirements, that the restrictions imposed must be aimed at providing a solution and must not result in a change of the substance or the essence of a right acquired under a contract. The Supreme Court decision relies in part on the following statement:\n\n\"...it is not useless to remind, as the Tribunal has done for long, that restrictions imposed by the State on the normal exercise of patrimonial rights must be reasonable, limited in time, and constitute a remedy and not a mutation in the substance or essence of the right acquired by judicial decision or contract. It follows that the mechanisms devised to overcome the emergency are subject to a limit and this is its reasonableness, with the ensuing impossibility of altering or distorting the economic significance of the rights of individuals. and it is beyond doubt that to condition or limit those rights affects patrimonial intangibility and puts an obstacle to the purpose of consolidating justice.\"92\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, Judgment in the case *\"Provincial de San Luis c. P. E. N. -Ley 25561, Dto. 1570/01 y 214/02 s/ amparo)* \", March 5, 2003. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that a decision of the Argentine Supreme Court held, in respect of \"pesification,\" that this measure was compatible with Article 17 of the Constitution and that Articles 617 and 619 of the Civil Code could not be read in a blind manner.93 Based on the Emergency Law and *force majeure*, the Court overturned a decision of the Federal Court of Paran\u00e1. This decision, however, does not overrule other decisions of the Supreme Court and other tribunals in Argentina as it only applies to the case at hand. Moreover, the *Procurador General* based his own report to the Court on the fact that the measures were temporary and that the crisis was largely over, a consideration on which the Court also relied.94 Dissenting views were also expressed.95\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, Judgment in the case \" *Bustos, Alberto Roque y otros c/Estado Nacional y otros s/amparo* \", October 26, 2004, in www.csjn.gov.ar/documentos/novedades.jsp\n\nReport of the Procurador General, October 22, 2004, in www.csjn.gov.ar/documentos/novedades.jsp\n\nDissenting Opinion of Supreme Court Judge Carlos S. Fyat.\n\n217.\n\nIn light of this discussion, the Tribunal is persuaded that the state of necessity under domestic law does not offer an excuse if the result of the measures in question is to alter the substance or the essence of contractually acquired rights. This is particularly so if the application of such measures extends beyond a strictly temporary period.\n\n218.\n\nA second concept under which contractual rights might eventually be adjusted is that of unjust enrichment. Although not formally invoked by the Respondent in this dispute, it underlies some of its arguments, particularly the argument that the dollar-based tariff would result in unfairness and unreasonableness, or more importantly that tariffs would have been excessive either in the domestic or the export markets.\n\n219.\n\nA number of provisions of the Argentine Civil Code are inspired by the concept of unjust enrichment and it has often been applied by Argentine courts.96 However, given the difficulty in establishing who has gained and who has lost without legitimate cause, the application of the concept has been surrounded by uncertainty.\n\nRub\u00e9n H. Compagnucci de Caso: Manual de Obligaciones, 1997, at 82.\n\n220.\n\nIn this particular instance, the application of the dollar standard at the time of the recession might, for example, have appeared as an unfair advantage. However, as discussed, the facts point in the opposite direction, namely to where the operator of the service suffers the entire burden of the situation and in fact subsidizes other sectors of the economy which thus become the real beneficiaries. Therefore, although the crisis and the measures taken brought about legal and economic uncertainties, the Tribunal cannot ignore contractual rights on the basis of an alleged unjust enrichment.\n\n221.\n\nThis Tribunal wishes to add a further observation. In 1968 another mechanism for the adjustment of contracts was introduced in the Argentine Civil Code with the inclusion of Article 1198. Under the terms of this Article, contracts must be done, interpreted and enforced in good faith in accordance with what the parties should have reasonably understood. If the burden of one party were to become excessively onerous as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, it could request the termination of the contract, except if that party was liable and remiss; the other party could then offer more equitable terms as a means to forestall termination. This mechanism has also given rise to important scholarly writings and court decisions.97\n\nWitness Statement by Dr. Eduardo Ratti, August 13, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 5, at 1139-1144.\n\n222.\n\nThe theory of \"impr\u00e9vision\" was thus expressly introduced into the Argentine Civil Code. The Respondent has relied on this theory in explaining the meaning of the Emergency Law and its reference to this particular Article.98 The purpose of this law, in the Respondent's argument, is to rebalance the benefits of the parties against the backdrop of changing realities.\n\nArgentine Answer, at 241, with reference to Article 11 of the Emergency Law and its connection to Article 1198 of the Civil Code.\n\n223.\n\nThe Federal judge issuing the 2000 injunction had this mechanism in mind as well when she explained that \"it could be that the balance of interests between the licensees and the consumers that was sought by the law broke down as a result of emerging economic situations. It would seem possible to argue that the economic and financial equation of the contract would break when the consumer must pay more for the same service even if the economy is evidencing negative figures. \"99\n\nCourt Injunction of August 18, 2000, as cited in Argentine Answer, at 86-87. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n224.\n\nThe legal extent of this concept both in civil and administrative law was laid down by the French Conseil d'Etat in the landmark case \"Gaz de Bordeaux,\" which, interestingly, also dealt with the gas industry.100 The general principles on the application of this theory in administrative contracts, particularly those concerning concessions, were first identified in this decision, pointing out that the event in question had to be unforeseeable and external to the parties, exceed all reasonable expectations, and result in a profound unbalancing of the contract. The redress also had to be temporary as otherwise the long-term life of the contract would become unviable.101\n\nConseil d'Etat, *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Eclairage de Bordeaux*, Rec. 125, concl. Chardenet, 30 Mars 1916, in M. Long, P. Weil et al. Les Grands Arr\u00eats de la Jurisprudence Administrative, 2003, at 188-189 (hereinafter *Gaz de Bordeaux*).\n\nCMS Memorial, at 53.\n\n225.\n\nThe provisions of the Emergency Law, however, fail to meet certain essential conditions for the operation of the theory of \"impr\u00e9vision.\" First, if the imbalance were foreseeable, the theory is not applicable. As explained above, in arguing that the tariff included both the devaluation as well as the country risks, the Respondent is simultaneously admitting that this risk was foreseeable and actually foreseen. In this respect the Claimant believes the risk of devaluation was indeed foreseen as it argues that express guarantees were offered to offset such risk. Second, the concept requires the aggrieved party to request the termination of the contract before a competent court, while in the present dispute the measure was unilaterally decided by one party. In addition, the views of the courts have been rather critical of the measures adopted as noted above. In essence, the pesification was imposed and the target of rebalancing and compensating differences in 180 days was not met.\n\n226.\n\nThe approach taken by the French Conseil d'Etat, however, as will be explained, is most pertinent for the attribution of liability in the present case.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal must note that other traditional legal excuses, such as *force majeure*, are not available in this case as the events discussed were foreseeable and foreseen.\n\n*21. Adjustment Mechanisms under the License and the Law*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, does not need to look into general principles of law to find an answer as to how the contract in this case could be adjusted to new economic realities. The pertinent mechanisms are embodied in the law and the License itself.\n\n229.\n\nThe Gas Law provided for a mechanism in which the final price to the consumer would be determined by reference to three factors: first, the price of gas at the wellhead, that is at the point of injection into the transportation system; second, the transportation tariff; and third, the distribution tariff. The Tribunal notes that the first of these factors has already been successfully renegotiated and adjusted.102\n\nAgreement between the Secretary of Energy and the gas producers signed on April 2, 2004, and Resolution 208/2004 related thereto.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent explains in this connection that, irrespective of the currency used, the operator must obtain a reasonable return, as this is mandated under the law in conjunction with the concept of a fair and reasonable tariff. It is further explained that, in case of devaluation, the tariff should be reduced as a consequence of lower domestic prices, while, in case of revaluation of the peso, tariffs should increase as costs would also increase.103\n\nArgentina Answer, at 60.\n\n231.\n\nTo this end, the Law provided for the periodic revision of tariffs so as to reflect the changes in the value of goods and services related to the activities of the operator.104 As explained by the Respondent, three adjustment mechanisms were devised to attain this result. The first was the January and July adjustments of tariffs in accordance with the US PPI. The second adjustment mechanism was to take account of increased efficiency (Factor X),105 which would apply as from the first five-year review and which could have resulted in the decrease of tariffs if efficiency had increased. The third adjustment mechanism was to apply in connection with investment (Factor K),106 and was also applicable as from the first five-year review. This third adjustment mechanism could result in the increase of tariffs so as to finance investments that could not otherwise be financed by the tariffs in force. The Claimant believes in this connection that factors X and K could only be introduced in the context of five-year reviews and not in other instances.\n\nGas Law, Article 41.\n\nGas Decree, Article 41; Clause 9.4.1.2 of the License.\n\nGas Decree, Article 41 (2); Clause 9.4.1.3 of the License.\n\n232.\n\nIn addition, the Law provided for a five-year review107 which would undertake a comprehensive examination of the tariffs and the method used for their calculation, also taking into account as far as possible factors X and K. The parties have different interpretations as to the extent of the five-year review. While, for the Claimant, adjustments would be basically automatic following the application of factors X and K,108 for the Respondent, this review could be broader and include other elements relevant to tariff determination.109 Otherwise, the Respondent asserts, the Claimant would have an insurance policy or a super-right under the License that would ensure profits under any circumstances, irrespective of the prevailing economic conditions.\n\nGas Law, Article 42.\n\nCMS Reply at 22; Witness Statement of Dr. Patricio Carlos Perkins, August 10, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 2, at 342-343; Written Witness Statement of Dr. Patricio Carlos Perkins of March 12, 2004.\n\nArgentina Answer, at 69-73, with reference to the preparatory documents of the second five-year review (RQT II).\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Argentina's interpretation of this issue is in part correct. While taking factors X and K into consideration, the review might be broader if justified by circumstances. Annex F of the Offer, for example, provides that future reviews of tariffs could include changes in the form of tariffs and the categories of consumers and services available.110\n\nPublic Offer of July 17, 1992, Annex F, 1.3; Consultants Report concerning RQT II, March 8, 2001; Argentina Answer, at 68.\n\n234.\n\nThis interpretation, however, does not mean that the tariff structure envisaged under the law and the License could be dismantled at will. On the contrary, the guiding principles would always have to prevail. Among such principles was the guarantee of a reasonable rate of return; stability, coherence and foreseeability; and the need to avoid significant variations in the tariffs when applying factors X and K.111 In this sense, as argued by the Claimant, it is not a discretionary power.\n\nCMS Reply, at 23.\n\n235.\n\nIt must also be kept in mind that the License expressly included a commitment to the effect that it would not be altered unless the written consent of the licensee was first obtained and that tariffs would not be frozen or subject to price controls. Otherwise compensation would be paid.\n\n236.\n\nThe first five-year review was completed in 1997 but the second review, scheduled to take place in 2002, was never completed.\n\n237.\n\nThe Gas Law also provides for an Extraordinary Review that can be initiated by the licensees or ENARGAS so as to correct tariffs that might be deemed inadequate, discriminatory or preferential in circumstances which are both objective and justified.112 The effect of certain taxes can also result in a corresponding adjustment of the related tariffs.113\n\nGas Law, Article 47.\n\nGas Law, Article 41.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal can therefore conclude that if a rebalance of the contractual commitments was required because of changing economic circumstances and their effect on costs and returns, the mechanisms to meet this objective were available under the law and the License. The necessary adjustments could be accommodated within the structure of the guarantees offered to the Claimant. This approach, in turn, would have made any unilateral determination by the Respondent unnecessary. The Claimant itself accepts that tariffs could be lowered within the regulatory framework to reflect the reduction in peso costs and thus also recognizes that the adjustment mechanism, under that scenario, would not have worked to its advantage.114\n\nCMS Post-hearing brief, at 3; Witness Statement of Dr. Patricio Carlos Perkins, August 10, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 2, at 342-343.\n\n*22. Attribution of Liability under Argentine Law*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that the legal commitments made by the Republic of Argentina to the Claimant under the applicable law and the License were not kept. This is so under the legal framework governing the gas sector but it is also so under the applicable provisions of the Civil Code and administrative law. In the absence of any express and clear provision allowing one party to depart from solemn contractual obligations undertaken toward another party, the sanctity of contracts established in the Civil Code and the protection of property mandated by the Argentine Constitution unquestionably prevail as recalled on more than one occasion by the Argentine Supreme Court. The Court has held that\n\n\"...when under a law in force an individual has fulfilled all the substantial acts and obligations and formal requirements provided to be entitled to a right, it must be held as acquired, and its modification by a later norm is inadmissible without infringement of the constitutional right to property.\"115\n\nThis is the case in the context of this dispute.\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, Fallos 296:737; 299:379; 303:1877; 307:305, as cited in Argentine Supreme Court, Judgment in the case *\"Provincial de San Luis c. P. E. N. - Ley 25561, Dto. 1570/01 y 214/02 s/ amparo)\",* March 5, 2003. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n240.\n\nThere is of course the question of the reality of the crisis that has been described. The Tribunal explained above that this reality cannot be ignored and it will not do so. The crisis, however, can only be taken into account as a matter of fact. And facts of course do not eliminate compliance with the law but do have a perceptible influence on the manner in which the law can be applied.\n\n241.\n\nIn the case of *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00e9clairage de Bordeaux*, also known as *Gaz de Bordeaux*, cited above, the French Conseil d'Etat had to decide a dispute in 1916 which, in a number of respects, was similar to the present one. As a consequence of the Great War the price of coal had more than tripled, amply surpassing the price originally envisaged under the concession contract for the provision of public gas lighting to the City of Bordeaux. The concession contract was held to govern the respective obligations of the parties until its expiration, in particular the provision of a public service and its remuneration by means of the tariffs stipulated. Normal market conditions could move the price in a manner favorable or unfavorable to the company and this was to be considered a normal business risk that each party was to have considered at the time of entering into legal obligations.\n\n242.\n\nThe economic impact of the war led to such price increases that the adjustment envisaged under the contract was clearly insufficient and the economic viability of the contract was profoundly affected. The company could not, therefore, be required to provide the service in such abnormal conditions. The Conseil d'Etat accordingly held that\n\n\".just as the Company cannot argue that it should not be required to bear any increase in the price.it would be totally excessive if it is admitted that such increases are to be considered a normal business risk; on the contrary, it is necessary to find a solution that puts an end to temporary difficulties, taking into account both the general interest. and the special conditions that do not allow the contract to operate normally.; to this end it is necessary to decide, on the one hand, that the Company is required to provide the concession service and, on the other hand, that during this period it must bear only that part of the adverse consequences that the reasonable interpretation of the contract allows.\"116\n\n*Gaz de Bordeaux*, at 188-189. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n243.\n\nOn this basis, it was decided that the City of Bordeaux should pay compensation covering the remaining deficit and that, failing agreement of the parties on the amount of compensation, this was to be fixed by the judge to whom the case was remanded.\n\n244.\n\nWhile in the instant dispute the conditions for the operation of the \"th\u00e9orie de l'impr\u00e9vision\" are not met, for the reasons already explained, the fact is that the Claimant cannot ask to be entirely beyond the reach of the abnormal conditions prompted by the crisis, as this would be unrealistic. However, at the same time, it would be wholly unjustifiable that the Claimant be overburdened with all the costs of the crisis. This is particularly so in light of the subsidization that the Claimant has in effect had to meet in respect of other businesses in Argentina, a burden which if necessary has to be born by the Government, at least in part.\n\n245.\n\nThe Government has the duty to redress this abnormal situation, first, by putting an end to what by definition should be a temporary situation, a step that might be adequately taken in the context of the continuing negotiations between the parties, and next by paying compensation for the damage caused.\n\n246.\n\nSimilar to what was the case in *Gaz de Bordeaux*, since the parties have as yet been unable to reach an agreement through the process of contract renegotiation, compensation is to be fixed by a judge. As this Tribunal has no judge to whom the case could be remanded for that purpose, it will fix the compensation to that effect on its own authority.\n\n*23. Crisis Period Distinguished*\n---------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Argentine Government has argued that a distinction should be made between two sets of measures. On the one hand, the measures adopted in 2000, which specifically affected the gas industry. And on the second hand, those of general economic impact not directly related to the gas industry, which were adopted in 2001 - 2002 in the context of the then unfolding crisis. This distinction of the origin of the measures is not feasible. Thus, it has been shown that the general economic policy measures of 2001-2002 also had very specific effects on the Claimant, effects which the Tribunal is bound to take into account separately from the wider effects or justification of those measures.\n\n248.\n\nThe factual situation, however, allows the Tribunal to take into account different situations present at distinct periods in time. The crisis had in itself a severe impact on the Claimant's business, but this impact must to some extent be attributed to the business risk the Claimant took on when investing in Argentina, this being particularly the case as it related to decrease in demand. Such effects cannot be ignored as if business had continued as usual. Otherwise, both parties would not be sharing some of the costs of the crisis in a reasonable manner and the decision could eventually amount to an insurance policy against business risk, an outcome that, as the Respondent has rightly argued, would not be justified. On the other hand, a number of the measures adopted did indeed contribute to such hardship and the burden of those ought not to be placed on the Claimant alone.\n\n249.\n\nThese events and effects, however, must be separated and distinguished from the situation that has characterized the Argentine economy in the aftermath of the crisis, including the situation that prevails today. The Tribunal does not wish to imply that the crisis in Argentina is fully over, because aftershocks are still felt in the economy, particularly in the social sector, but the repercussions are no longer as intense or widespread. Considering the question of time necessary for recovery, an expert for the Respondent stated that past economic downturns have taken up to eight years to overcome.117 Be that as it may, the fact is that the Argentine economy has improved substantially in the past several months and it is at present clearly heading towards recovery in the short to medium term. All relevant indicators show unequivocally this to be the case.118\n\nExpert Statement of Professor Nouriel Roubini, August 18, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 8, at 1777; see generally the Written Expert Report of Professor Nouriel Roubini, annexed to Argentina Rejoinder.\n\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, \"Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean\", Doc. LC/G.2265-P/I, December 2004.\n\n250.\n\nIn light of the economic information available, the Tribunal considers that sometime between late 2004 and early 2005 the crisis period came to an end. The Tribunal notes in this respect that the Emergency Law declared emergency until December 10, 2003 and that renegotiation was extended for an additional year.119 A further extension was enacted in 2004.120\n\nLaw No. 25,790, Bolet\u00edn Oficial, October 22, 2003; Argentina Answer, at 199.\n\nLaw No. 25,972, approved by Congress on December 17, 2004.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal will take into account these different realities in reaching a determination on the appropriate compensation. However, it must first examine the extent of the protection granted under the Treaty and the issue concerning the state of necessity under international law.\n\n*24. Has there been Expropriation of the Investment?*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nHaving established that the Respondent did not keep the commitments and obligations it had undertaken under its own legislation, regulations and the Licence to TGN, the question is then what is the legal situation in terms of the protection granted by the Treaty to the investor.\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimant's first major allegation in this respect is that there has been an expropriation in breach of the express provision of Article IV(1) of the Treaty. This Article provides as follows:\n\n\"Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\u2018expropriation') except for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II (2).\"\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimant argues in this connection that expropriation need not be direct or result in the transfer of title or physical possession but that it can also be indirect if the result, as held by the Tribunal in *Metalclad,* is to deprive the owner \"...in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"121 A wealth of cases and scholarly writings are invoked in support of this contention and of the argument that such an expropriation might be entirely independent of the State's intention.122\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States* (Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1 *(Metalclad),* 40 *ILM* 55 (2001), para. 103; CMS Memorial, at 71-72.\n\ni. e. *Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA Consulting Engineers of Iran*, 6 CTR 219 (1984-II). See also generally UNCTAD: Taking of Property, 2000.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that expropriation might be \"creeping\" in that it may unfold through a series of acts over a period of time.123 The State's interference with assurances and undertakings offered to the investor, it is also argued, might result in the breach of an acquired right.124 Not even the public purpose of an expropriation, it is further asserted, can alter the legal obligation to pay compensation.125 The Claimant also argues that the measures adopted stemmed less from the prevailing economic conditions than from the political antagonism which the Government had developed towards foreign investors generally and towards some companies in particular whether because of electoral strategies or ideological connotations of successive governments.\n\ni. e. *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S. A. v. Republic of Costa Rica* (Case No. ARB/96/1), Final Award of February 17, 2000, 15 *ICSID Review\u2014FILJ* 169 (2000).\n\ni. e. *CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic (CME),* Partial Award of September 13, 2001, as published in http://www.mfcr.cz/static/Arbitraz/en/PartialAward.pdf.\n\ni. e. *Santa Elena*, para. 68.\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the measures adopted by the Argentine Government during the period 2000-2002 resulted in indirect and creeping expropriation of acquired rights in the form of legal commitments, assurances and guarantees expressly offered to the investor. The Claimant says that as a result, it can no longer rely on the basic conditions that were critical for its decision to undertake the project; that the value of its assets has been wiped out; and that it cannot enjoy the economic benefits reasonably expected of the investment. The specific date of the expropriation is, in the Claimant's view, August 18, 2000, the date that the court injunction was issued and with it the beginning of a process that had the creeping effect described above.\n\n257.\n\nThe Argentine Government has not been short of arguments to oppose the expropriation claim and has presented a wealth of relevant cases and writers to refute the Claimant's arguments. It is first held that not only has there been no transfer of property of any kind but that none of the measures taken amount to an interference which could be compared to or result in an expropriation. It is also explained that none of the commitments invoked by the investor have the meaning the investor assigns to them and, even less so, could they qualify as an acquired right or constitute a legitimate expectation. This, in the Respondent's view, is particularly so because the commitments invoked arise not from the Government's undertakings, but from the Information Memorandum prepared by private consultants.\n\n258.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, TGN has continued to operate normally and has full use of its property and there has been no redistribution of wealth of any kind nor has there been an intention to do so, unlike the situation characterizing all the decisions invoked by the Claimant;126 neither has the State derived any benefit from the measures taken, thus meeting the standard set in the *Lauder v. Czech Republic* case when denying the occurrence of expropriation.127 The Respondent, as noted, also argues that the measures adopted are temporary.\n\nArgentina Answer, at 179, with reference to the table of cases invoked by the Claimant.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic (Lauder)*, UNCITRAL Final Award of September 3, 2001, http://www.mfcr.cz/static/Arbitraz/en/FinalAward.doc, para. 203; *S. D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada,* Partial Award of November 13, 2000, http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-Ynac/documents/myersvcanadapartialaward final 13-11-00.pdf, para. 280.\n\n259.\n\nEmphasis is placed by the Respondent on the argument that neither has there been substantial deprivation of the fundamental rights of ownership nor have these rights been rendered useless; to the contrary, the value of shares of a comparable company has been increasing since the crisis. In the Respondent's discussion of the issue, it is stated that all the specific criteria used to deny substantial deprivation in the *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* case are met in this case also: the investor is in control of the investment, the Government does not manage the day-to-day operations of the company, no officers or employees of the company is under arrest, the payment of dividends has not been interfered with, the directors and managers of the company are appointed by the company, and the investor has full ownership and control of the investment.128\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada (Pope & Talbot)*, Interim Award of June 26, 2000, as published in http://www.appletonlaw.com/cases/P&T-INTERIM%20AWARD.PDF, para. 100; Argentina Answer, at 205-208.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined with great attention the views expounded by the parties on this issue. Both parties are in agreement that no direct expropriation has taken place. The issue for the Tribunal to determine is then whether the measures adopted constitute an indirect or regulatory expropriation. The answer is of course not quite simple for indeed the measures have had an important effect on the business of the Claimant.\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal in the *Lauder* case rightly explained that\n\n\"The concept of indirect (or *\"de facto\"*, or *\"creeping\"*) expropriation is not clearly defined. Indirect expropriation or nationalization is a measure that does not involve an overt taking, but that effectively neutralized the enjoyment of the property.\"129\n\n*Lauder,*http://www.mfcr.cz/static/Arbitraz/en/FinalAward.doc, para. 200.\n\n262.\n\nThe essential question is therefore to establish whether the enjoyment of the property has been effectively neutralized. The standard that a number of tribunals have applied in recent cases where indirect expropriation has been contended is that of substantial deprivation. In the *Metalclad* case the tribunal held that this kind of expropriation relates to incidental interference with the use of property which has \"the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonable-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"130 Similarly, the Iran - United States Claims Tribunal has held that deprivation must affect \"fundamental rights of ownership,\"131 a criteria reaffirmed in the *CME v. Czech Republic* case.132 The test of interference with present uses and prevention of the realization of a reasonable return on investments has also been discussed by the Respondent in this context.133\n\n*Metalclad,* 40 *ILM* 55 (2001), para. 103.\n\n*Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA Consulting Engineers of Iran*, 6 CTR 219 (1984-II), at 225; see also *Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran,* 10 CTR 121 (1986-I).\n\n*CME*, http://www.mfcr.cz/static/Arbitraz/en/PartialAward.pdf, para. 688.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court, *Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City*, 438 U.S. 104 (1978); Argentina Rejoinder, at 182.\n\n263.\n\nSubstantial deprivation was addressed in detail by the tribunal in the *Pope & Talbot* case.134 The Government of Argentina has convincingly argued that the list of issues to be taken into account for reaching a determination on substantial deprivation, as discussed in that case, is not present in the instant dispute. In fact, the Respondent has explained, the investor is in control of the investment; the Government does not manage the day-to-day operations of the company; and the investor has full ownership and control of the investment.\n\n*Pope & Talbot*, http://www.appletonlaw.com/cases/P&T-INTERIM%20AWARD.PDF, paras. 96, 102.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that this is indeed the case in this dispute and holds therefore that the Government of Argentina has not breached the standard of protection laid down in Article IV(1) of the Treaty.\n\n265.\n\nIt remains necessary to examine the extent of the interference caused by the measures on the Claimant's business operations under the other standards of the Treaty. This question will be addressed next by the Tribunal.\n\n*25. Has there been a Breach of Fair and Equitable Treatment?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThe second substantive standard of protection provided to investors under the Treaty is that of fair and equitable treatment. Article II(2)(a) provides:\n\n\"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\"\n\n267.\n\nUnder this provision, the Claimant asserts that Argentina has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard and has not ensured full protection and security to the investment, particularly insofar as it has profoundly altered the stability and predictability of the investment environment, an assurance that was key to its decision to invest. The Claimant cites a number of distinguished writers and decisions pointing out the significance of this particular requirement, with particular reference to the *CME* case, where it was held that\n\n\"[The Government] breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment by evisceration of the arrangements in reliance upon [which] the foreign investor was induced to invest.\"135\n\n*CME,* http://www.mfcr.cz/static/Arbitraz/en/PartialAward.pdf, para. 611. See also generally OECD: Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law, September 2004.\n\n268.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on the following finding of the tribunal in the *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. Mexico* case to the effect that fair and equitable treatment:\n\n\". requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\"136\n\n*Tecmed,* Award of May 29, 2003, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/laudo-051903%20-English.pdf; 43 *ILM* 133 (2004), para. 154.\n\n269.\n\nAccording to the Claimant's argument, the uncertainty characterizing the period 2000 - 2002 and the final determinations under the Emergency Law that dismantled all the arrangements in reliance on which the investment had been made, are the main events that resulted in the breach of this standard.\n\n270.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the standard of fair and equitable treatment is too vague to allow for any clear identification of its meaning and, in any event, it only provides for a general and basic principle found in the law of the host State which at the same time is compatible with an international minimum standard. A deliberate intention to ignore an obligation or even bad faith would be required to breach the standard, the argument adds.\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent argues next that the standard is not different from the international minimum standard, citing to this effect a number of authors and cases and in particular the tribunal's holding in the *Robert Azinian and others v. Mexico* case that an \"investor should not be dealt with in a manner that contravenes international law.\"137 The *Pope & Talbot* case is also discussed by the Respondent in this context, explaining that in spite of the fact that it opted for a NAFTA standard additional to or higher than that of customary international law it still based its test on equity, justice and reasonableness.138\n\n*Robert Azinian and others v. United Mexican States* (Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2) *(Azinian)*, Award of November 1, 1999.14 *ICSID Review\u2014FILJ* 538 (1999); 39 **ILM** 537 (2000); 121 *I.L.R.* 2 (2002); 5 *ICSID Rep.* 272 (2002); *American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. v. Democratic Republic of the Congo* (Case No. ARB/93/1), Award of February 21, 1997, 36 **ILM** 1534 (1997); 12 *Int'l Arb. Rep.*, No. 4, at Sec. A (Apr. 1997); 5 *ICSID Rep.* 14 (2002), Argentina Answer, at 225-227.\n\nArgentina Answer, at 226.\n\n272.\n\nArgentina believes that none of the measures adopted breaches the standard or for that matter international law as the legislative prerogatives of the State cannot be frozen in time and the Emergency Law is just one such exercise of its prerogative. In the Respondent's view, stability does not mean immobilization and the measures adopted, particularly the \"pesification\", were the solution necessary to prevent greater social damage and poverty. It is further argued that there is ample precedent upholding the legality of devaluation, both under domestic and international law, with particular reference to the situation in the United States in the 1930s. It is also asserted that the Claimant has not proved any damage in connection with its allegation of breach of this standard and the compensation claimed under this item cannot in any way be assimilated to that corresponding to expropriation, as the Claimant requests.\n\n273.\n\nThe key issue that the Tribunal has to decide is whether the measures adopted in 2000 - 2002 breached the standard of protection afforded by Argentina's undertaking to provide fair and equitable treatment. The Treaty, like most bilateral investment treaties, does not define the standard of fair and equitable treatment and to this extent Argentina's concern about it being somewhat vague is not entirely without merit.\n\n274.\n\nThe Treaty Preamble makes it clear, however, that one principal objective of the protection envisaged is that fair and equitable treatment is desirable \"to maintain a stable framework for investments and maximum effective use of economic resources.\" There can be no doubt, therefore, that a stable legal and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n275.\n\nThe measures that are complained of did in fact entirely transform and alter the legal and business environment under which the investment was decided and made. The discussion above, about the tariff regime and its relationship with a dollar standard and adjustment mechanisms unequivocally shows that these elements are no longer present in the regime governing the business operations of the Claimant. It has also been established that the guarantees given in this connection under the legal framework and its various components were crucial for the investment decision.\n\n276.\n\nIn addition to the specific terms of the Treaty, the significant number of treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, that have dealt with this standard also unequivocally shows that fair and equitable treatment is inseparable from stability and predictability. Many arbitral decisions and scholarly writings point in the same direction.139\n\n*Alex Genin and others v. Republic of Estonia* (Case No. ARB/99/2) *(Genin)*, Award of June 25, 2001 **,** 17 *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ* 395 (2002); P. Juillard: \"L\u2019\u00e9volution des sources du droit des investissements\". Recueil des Cours de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Droit International, Vol. 250, 1994.\n\n277.\n\nIt is not a question of whether the legal framework might need to be frozen as it can always evolve and be adapted to changing circumstances, but neither is it a question of whether the framework can be dispensed with altogether when specific commitments to the contrary have been made. The law of foreign investment and its protection has been developed with the specific objective of avoiding such adverse legal effects.\n\n278.\n\nIt was held by the Tribunal in the *Metalclad* case that Mexico had in several ways failed to provide a\n\n\"... predictable framework for Metalclad's business planning and investment. The totality of these circumstances demonstrate a lack of orderly process and timely disposition in relation to an investor of a Party acting in the expectation that it would be treated fairly and justly. \"140\n\n*Metalclad,* 40 *ILM* 55 (2001), para. 99.\n\n279.\n\nSo too the Tribunal in the *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales* case has held in this respect:\n\n\"The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.\"141\n\n*Tecmed,*http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/laudo-051903%20-English.pdf; 43 *ILM* 133 (2004), para. 154.\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal believes this is an objective requirement unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question. Of course, such intention and bad faith can aggravate the situation but are not an essential element of the standard.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, concludes against the background of the present dispute that the measures adopted resulted in the objective breach of the standard laid down in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n282.\n\nThere is one additional aspect the Tribunal must examine having heard the arguments of the parties. That is whether the standard of fair and equitable treatment is separate and more expansive than that of customary international law, as held by the tribunal in *Pope and Talbot*, or whether it is identical with the customary international law minimum standard, as argued by Argentina.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the discussion prompted by these arguments, particularly with reference to the NAFTA Free Trade Commission's Note of Interpretation identifying the fair and equitable treatment standard with that of customary international law.142 This development has led to further treaty clarifications as in the Chile - United States Free Trade Agreement.143\n\nNAFTA Free Trade Commission, Interpretation of NAFTA Article 1105(1), July 21, 2001, http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/NAFTA-Interpr-en.asp.\n\nChile-United States Free Trade Agreement of June 6, 2003, http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade\\_Agreements/Bilateral/Chile\\_FTA/Final\\_Texts/asset\\_upload\\_file1\\_4004.pdf, Article 10.4.2.\n\n284.\n\nWhile the choice between requiring a higher treaty standard and that of equating it with the international minimum standard might have relevance in the context of some disputes, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it is relevant in this case. In fact, the Treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment and its connection with the required stability and predictability of the business environment, founded on solemn legal and contractual commitments, is not different from the international law minimum standard and its evolution under customary law.\n\n*26. Has there Been Arbitrariness and/or Discrimination?*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) of the Treaty provides that\n\n\"Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments.\"\n\n286.\n\nThe Claimant invokes the test defined in the *Pope and Talbot* case, and asserts that because the measures adopted are opposed to the rule of law or surprise a sense of judicial propriety, it follows that there has been arbitrary treatment of the investor and hence the Treaty standard has been breached. In the Claimant's view, dismantling the whole legal framework of the gas industry is contrary to any reasonable expectation.\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that such measures are discriminatory because they result in a dissimilar treatment of investors in similar situations, in accordance with the test defined in the *Goetz v. Burundi* case.144 In particular, the Claimant explains that other public services relying on dollar-based tariffs, such as telephone companies, water distribution enterprises, banks, waterway transportation companies and other businesses, and significantly, the gas producers, have all been treated in a more favorable manner.145 It is also argued that discrimination does not relate exclusively to nationality and can result from the compulsory transfer of resources of one economic agent or sector to another, as has happened in the Argentine economy.\n\n*Antoine Goetz and others v. Republic of Burundi,* Award embodying the parties' settlement agreement of February 10, 1999, 15 *ICSID Review\u2014FILJ* 457 (2000).\n\nIn respect of the renegotiation with gas producers see the Witness Statement of Dr. Bernardo Velar de Irigoyen, August 11, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 3, at 524-525.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent rejects such considerations and argues that the measures adopted were reasonable and proportional to the objective pursued. It is argued, following the findings in the *ELSI* case, that discrimination requires intentional treatment in favor of a national and to the detriment of a foreign investor, a treatment that does not apply to other nationals in a similar situation.146 The *Genin v. Estonia* case is also invoked by the Respondent to the effect that discrimination and arbitrariness require bad faith or a willful disregard of due process of law.147\n\n*Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula*, International Court of Justice, Judgment of July 20, 1989, ICJ Reports 1989, 15.\n\n*Genin*, Argentina Answer, at 255. Also *Myers*, Argentina Answer, at 257.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts, following Professor Schachter, that arbitrariness can in no case be used to describe legislation to carry out economic, social or political objectives.148 In any event, it is argued, the standard provides that discrimination is forbidden in respect of similarly situated groups or categories of people, which is not the case in respect of the gas industry. Neither, in the Respondent's view, is there any discrimination based on nationality, this being the only one envisaged by the prohibition under international law.\n\nOscar Schachter: International Law in Theory and Practice, 1991, at 313, Argentina Answer, at 259.\n\n290.\n\nThe standard of protection against arbitrariness and discrimination is related to that of fair and equitable treatment. Any measure that might involve arbitrariness or discrimination is in itself contrary to fair and equitable treatment. The standard is next related to impairment: the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of the investment must be impaired by the measures adopted.\n\n291.\n\nIn the *Lauder* case, an equivalent provision of the pertinent investment treaty was explained in accordance with the definition of \"arbitrary\" in Black's Law Dictionary, which states that an arbitrary decision is one \"depending on individual discretion;. founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact.\"149\n\n*Lauder,* para. 221.\n\n292.\n\nThis Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's view about arbitrariness because there has been no impairment, for example, in respect of the management and operation of the investment. Admittedly, some adverse effects can be noted in respect of other matters, such as the use, expansion or disposal of the investment, which since the measures were adopted have been greatly limited. To the extent that such effects might endure, the test applied in the *Lauder* case becomes relevant and could result in a factor reinforcing the related finding of a breach of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n293.\n\nThe situation in respect of discrimination is somewhat similar. The Respondent's argument about discrimination existing only in similarly situated groups or categories of people is correct, and no discrimination can be discerned in this respect. Admittedly, it is quite difficult to establish whether that similarity exists only in the context of the gas transportation and distribution industry or extends to other utilities as well.\n\n294.\n\nBe that as it may, the fact is that to the extent that the measures persisted beyond the crisis, the differentiation between various categories or groups of businesses becomes more difficult to explain. Indeed, the Government of Argentina has successfully concluded renegotiations and other arrangements with a number of industries and businesses equally protected by guarantees of investment treaties. This includes the gas producers, but not the transportation and distribution side of the industry. The gas producers have been allowed to proceed to a gradual tariff adjustment to be completed by mid-2005.150 The longer the differentiation is kept the more evident the issue becomes, thus eventually again reinforcing the related finding about the breach of fair and equitable treatment.\n\nWitness Statement of Dr. Christian Folgar, August 12, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 4, at 765-769; Witness Statement of Dr. Bernardo Velar de Irigoyen, August 11, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 3, at 524-525.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, cannot hold that arbitrariness and discrimination are present in the context of the crisis noted, and to the extent that some effects become evident they will relate rather to the breach of fair and equitable treatment than to the breach of separate standards under the Treaty.\n\n*27. Has the Protection under the Umbrella Clause been Breached?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Claimant invokes yet another ground on which the protection and guarantees of the Treaty have been breached by the Respondent, as under Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty which provides that each party \"shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimant argues in this respect that all the commitments made by Argentina towards the investment, whether under the legislation in force or contractual arrangements, have been breached as a result of the measures adopted and particularly the dismantling of the tariff regime and related matters. Therefore, the argument follows, the umbrella clause of the Treaty has also been breached.\n\n298.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, first of all no commitments were made under the law, and those that were made under the License were purely contractual. Following the *Azinian* case in respect of concessions contracts,151 and the *Genin*152 and *SGS v. Pakistan* cases in respect of Licenses,153 the Respondent argues that not all contract breaches amount to treaty breaches and hence cannot be protected under a clause of this kind. In any event, it is asserted that the Claimant can invoke no rights or commitments under the License as these concern only TGN.\n\n*Azinian*, 14 *ICSID Review\u2014FILJ* 538 (1999); 39 *ILM* 537 (2000); 121 *I.L.R.* 2 (2002); 5 *ICSID Rep.* 272 (2002); Argentina Answer, at 225.\n\n*Genin*, 17 *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ* 395 (2002); Argentina Answer, at 223-224.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (Case No. ARB/01/13) *(SGS v. Pakistan),* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, August 6, 2003, 18 *ICSID Review\u2014FILJ* 301 (2003), para. 35.\n\n299.\n\nThe Tribunal will not discuss the jurisdictional aspects involved in the Respondent's argument, as these were dealt with in the decision on jurisdiction. Regarding the merits of the argument, however, the Tribunal believes the Respondent is correct in arguing that not all contract breaches result in breaches of the Treaty. The standard of protection of the treaty will be engaged only when there is a specific breach of treaty rights and obligations or a violation of contract rights protected under the treaty. Purely commercial aspects of a contract might not be protected by the treaty in some situations, but the protection is likely to be available when there is significant interference by governments or public agencies with the rights of the investor.\n\n300.\n\nThis discussion has been, to an important extent, clarified in recent decisions of arbitral tribunals having to deal with the issue of contract and treaty claims. This is particularly so in the *Lauder v. Czech Republic*, *Genin v. Estonia*, *Aguas del Aconquija v.* *Argentina*,154*Azurix v. Argentina*,155*SGS v. Pakistan*, *SGS v. Philippines*156 and *Joy Mining v.* *Egypt* cases,157 among others. In these decisions, commercial disputes arising from a contract have been distinguished from disputes arising from the breach of treaty standards and their respective causes of action.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Award of November 21, 2000, 16 *ICSID Review\u2014FILJ* 641 (2001), 641.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction of December 8, 2003, 43 *ILM 262* (2004).\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines* (Case No. ARB/02/6) *(SGS v.* *Phillipines)*, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, January 29, 2004, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/SGSvPhil-final.pdf.\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Case No. ARB/03/11) *(Joy Mining)*, Award on Jurisdiction, August 6, 2004,http://www.asil.org/ilib/JoyMining\\_Egypt.pdf.\n\n301.\n\nNone of the measures complained of in this case can be described as a commercial question as they are all related to government decisions that have resulted in the interferences and breaches noted.\n\n302.\n\nWhile many, if not all, such interferences are closely related to other standards of protection under the Treaty, there are in particular two stabilization clauses contained in the License that have significant effect when it comes to the protection extended to them under the umbrella clause. The first is the obligation undertaken not to freeze the tariff regime or subject it to price controls.158 The second is the obligation not to alter the basic rules governing the License without TGN's written consent.159\n\nLicense, Clause 9.8.\n\nLicense, Clause 18.2.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore conclude that the obligation under the umbrella clause of Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty has not been observed by the Respondent to the extent that legal and contractual obligations pertinent to the investment have been breached and have resulted in the violation of the standards of protection under the Treaty.\n\n**D. State of Necessity Contended in the Alternative**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Government of Argentina has contended in the alternative that in the event the Tribunal should come to the conclusion that there was a breach of the Treaty the Respondent should be exempted from liability in light of the existence of a state of necessity or state of emergency.160*Force majeure*, emergency and other terms have also been used by the Respondent in this context.\n\nArgentina Answer, p. 585; Argentina Rejoinder, p. 833.\n\n305.\n\nThis contention is founded on the severe economic, social and political crisis described above and on the belief that the very existence of the Argentine State was threatened by the events that began to unfold in 2000. The Respondent asserts in this respect that economic interest qualifies as an essential interest of the State when threatened by grave and imminent peril.\n\n306.\n\nIt is argued that the Emergency Law was enacted with the sole purpose of bringing under control the chaotic situation that would have followed the economic and social collapse that Argentina was facing. State of necessity based on this crisis would exclude, in the Respondent's argument, any wrongfulness of the measures adopted by the government and in particular would rule out compensation.\n\n307.\n\nIn support of its argument the Respondent invokes first the existence of the state of necessity under Argentine law and its acceptance under the Constitution and the decisions of courts. The Tribunal has already discussed the meaning of the state of necessity and the state of emergency under Argentine law and its interpretation by the Supreme Court, with particular reference to its temporary nature and the requirement not to upset the rights acquired by contract or judicial decision. These issues will not be discussed here again.\n\n308.\n\nThe Respondent has also invoked in support of its contention the existence of a state of necessity under both customary international law and the provisions of the Treaty. In so doing, the Respondent has raised one fundamental issue in international law.\n\n*28. The Respondent's View of the State of Necessity under Customary International Law*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent has mainly based its argument on this question on the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* case which held that the state of necessity is recognized by customary international law for \"precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation.\"161\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project*, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 51.\n\n310.\n\nThe *French Company of Venezuelan Railroads* case is invoked so as to justify that the government's duty was to itself when its \"own preservation is paramount.\"162 Further support is found in the *Dickson Car Wheel Co.* case where it was decided that the \"foreigner, residing in a country which by reasons of natural, social or international calamities is obliged to adopt these measures, must suffer the natural detriment to his affairs without any remedy, since Governments.are not insurers against every event.\"163\n\n*French Company of Venezuelan Railroads*, July 31, 1905, UNRIAA, Vol. X, at 353.\n\n*Dickson Car Wheel Co.*, July 1931, UNRIAA, Vol. IV, p. 670-682. The Respondent also cites in this connection the *Sea-Land Service Inc. v. Iran*, June 20, 1984, Iran-United States Claims Tribunal Reports, Vol. IV, p. 149-175.\n\n311.\n\nIn addition to the discussion of these and other cases, the Government of Argentina also relies on the work of the International Law Commission under the leadership of the Special Rapporteurs F. V. Garc\u00eda-Amador, Roberto Ago and James Crawford. In particular the Respondent argues that it meets the criteria set out in Article 25 of the Articles on International Responsibility.164 The specific terms of Article 25 will be discussed further below.\n\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UNGA Resolution 56/83, January 28, 2002.\n\n312.\n\nIn the Respondent's view the Argentine State was not only facing grave and imminent peril affecting an essential interest, but it did not contribute to the creation of the state of necessity in a substantive way. This situation, it is argued, was prompted for the most part by exogenous factors. It is further asserted that the measures adopted, particularly the pesification of contractual relations, were the only measures capable of safeguarding the essential economic interests affected. By introducing the measures, the Respondent argues, the essential interests of another State that was a beneficiary of the obligation breached or, for that matter, those of the international community as a whole were not affected and foreign investors were also not treated in a discriminatory manner.\n\n*29. The Claimant's View of the State of Necessity Under Customary International Law*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Claimant first argues in connection with the state of necessity that the Respondent has not met the heavy burden of proof required by the International Court of Justice in the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* case. The Claimant notes that the Court made reference to the work and views of the International Law Commission insofar the latter explained that \".the state of necessity can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concerned is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met......Those conditions reflect customary international law.\"165\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project*, pars. 51-52.\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimant asserts next that neither has the Respondent complied with the conditions set down for the operation of state of necessity under Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility. In the Claimant's view, severe as the crisis was, it did not involve \"grave\" or \"imminent\" peril nor has it been established that the Respondent State did not contribute to the emergency as most of the causes underlying the crisis were endogenous. Moreover, it is asserted that the Respondent has not shown that the measures adopted were the only means available to overcome the crisis.\n\n*30. The Tribunal's Findings in Respect of the State of Necessity under Customary International Law*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal, like the parties themselves, considers that Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility adequately reflect the state of customary international law on the question of necessity. This Article, in turn, is based on a number of relevant historical cases discussed in the Commentary,166 with particular reference to the *Caroline*,167 the *Russian Indemnity*,168*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale de Belgique*,169 the *Torrey Canyon*170 and the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* cases.\n\nJames Crawford: The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, 2002, at 178 et seq.\n\nThe *Caroline* incident of 1837 and related diplomatic correspondence of 1842, as discussed in Crawford, at 179-180.\n\n*Russian Indemnity* case, UNRIAA, Vol. XI, 431 (1912).\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice, *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale de Belgique*, 1939, Series A/B, No. 78.\n\nThe *Torrey Canyon*, Cmnd. 3246, 1967.\n\n316.\n\nArticle 25 reads as follows:\n\n\"1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole;\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\"\n\n317.\n\nWhile the existence of necessity as a ground for precluding wrongfulness under international law is no longer disputed, there is also consensus to the effect that this ground is an exceptional one and has to be addressed in a prudent manner to avoid abuse. The very opening of the Article to the effect that necessity \"may not be invoked\" unless strict conditions are met, is indicative of this restrictive approach of international law. Case law, state practice and scholarly writings amply support this restrictive approach to the operation of necessity.171 The reason is not difficult to understand. If strict and demanding conditions are not required or are loosely applied, any State could invoke necessity to elude its international obligations. This would certainly be contrary to the stability and predictability of the law.\n\nEric Wyler: L'lllicite et la Condition des Persones Priv\u00e9es, 1995, at 192 et seq.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal must now undertake the very difficult task of finding whether the Argentine crisis meets the requirements of Article 25, a task not rendered easier by the wide variety of views expressed on the matter and their heavy politicization. Again here the Tribunal is not called upon to pass judgment on the measures adopted in that connection but simply to establish whether the breach of the Treaty provisions discussed is devoid of legal consequences by the preclusion of wrongfulness.\n\n319.\n\nA first question the Tribunal must address is whether an essential interest of the State was involved in the matter. Again here the issue is to determine the gravity of the crisis. The need to prevent a major breakdown, with all its social and political implications, might have entailed an essential interest of the State in which case the operation of the state of necessity might have been triggered. In addition, the plea must under the specific circumstances of each case meet the legal requirements set out by customary international law.\n\n320.\n\nIn the instant case, the Respondent and leading economists are of the view that the crisis was of catastrophic proportions; other equally distinguished views, however, tend to qualify this statement. The Tribunal is convinced that the crisis was indeed severe and the argument that nothing important happened is not tenable. However, neither could it be held that wrongfulness should be precluded as a matter of course under the circumstances. As is many times the case in international affairs and international law, situations of this kind are not given in black and white but in many shades of grey.\n\n321.\n\nIt follows that the relative effect that can be reasonably attributed to the crisis does not allow for a finding on preclusion of wrongfulness. The Respondent's perception of extreme adverse effects, however, is understandable, and in that light the plea of necessity or emergency cannot be considered as an abuse of rights as the Claimant has argued.\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal turns next to the question whether there was in this case a grave and imminent peril. Here again the Tribunal is persuaded that the situation was difficult enough to justify the government taking action to prevent a worsening of the situation and the danger of total economic collapse. But neither does the relative effect of the crisis allow here for a finding in terms of preclusion of wrongfulness.\n\n323.\n\nA different issue, however, is whether the measures adopted were the \"only way\" for the State to safeguard its interests. This is indeed debatable. The views of the parties and distinguished economists are wide apart on this matter, ranging from the support of those measures to the discussion of a variety of alternatives, including dollarization of the economy, granting of direct subsidies to the affected population or industries and many others. Which of these policy alternatives would have been better is a decision beyond the scope of the Tribunal's task, which is to establish whether there was only one way or various ways and thus whether the requirements for the preclusion of wrongfulness have or have not been met.\n\n324.\n\nThe International Law Commission's comment to the effect that the plea of necessity is \"excluded if there are other (otherwise lawful) means available, even if they may be more costly or less convenient,\" is persuasive in assisting this Tribunal in concluding that the measures adopted were not the only steps available.172\n\nCrawford, at 184.\n\n325.\n\nA different condition for the admission of necessity relates to the requirement that the measures adopted do not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole. As the specific obligations towards another State are embodied in the Treaty, this question will be examined in the context of the applicable treaty provisions. It does not appear, however, that the essential interest of the international community as a whole was affected in any relevant way, nor that a peremptory norm of international law might have been compromised, a situation governed by Article 26 of the Articles.\n\n326.\n\nIn addition to the basic conditions set out under paragraph 1 of Article 25, there are two other limits to the operation of necessity arising from paragraph 2. As noted in the Commentary, the use of the expression \"in any case\" in the opening of the text means that each of these limits must be considered over and above the conditions of paragraph 1.173\n\nCrawford, at 185.\n\n327.\n\nThe first such limit arises when the international obligation excludes necessity, a matter which again will be considered in the context of the Treaty.\n\n328.\n\nThe second limit is the requirement for the State not to have contributed to the situation of necessity. The Commentary clarifies that this contribution must be \"sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral\". In spite of the view of the parties claiming that all factors contributing to the crisis were either endogenous or exogenous, the Tribunal is again persuaded that similar to what is the case in most crises of this kind the roots extend both ways and include a number of domestic as well as international dimensions. This is the unavoidable consequence of the operation of a global economy where domestic and international factors interact.\n\n329.\n\nThe issue, however, is whether the contribution to the crisis by Argentina has or has not been sufficiently substantial. The Tribunal, when reviewing the circumstances of the present dispute, must conclude that this was the case. The crisis was not of the making of one particular administration and found its roots in the earlier crisis of the 1980s and evolving governmental policies of the 1990s that reached a zenith in 2002 and thereafter. Therefore, the Tribunal observes that government policies and their shortcomings significantly contributed to the crisis and the emergency and while exogenous factors did fuel additional difficulties they do not exempt the Respondent from its responsibility in the matter.\n\n330.\n\nThere is yet another important element which the Tribunal must take into account. The International Court of Justice has in the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* case convincingly referred to the International Law Commission's view that all the conditions governing necessity must be \"cumulatively\" satisfied.174\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project*, pars. 51-52.\n\n331.\n\nIn the present case there are, as concluded, elements of necessity partially present here and there but when the various elements, conditions and limits are examined as a whole it cannot be concluded that all such elements meet the cumulative test. This in itself leads to the inevitable conclusion that the requirements of necessity under customary international law have not been fully met so as to preclude the wrongfulness of the acts.\n\n*31. The Emergency Clause of the Treaty*\n----------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nThe discussion on necessity and emergency is not confined to customary international law as there are also specific provisions of the Treaty dealing with this matter. Article XI of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n\n333.\n\nArticle IV(3) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.\"\n\n334.\n\nThe meaning and extent of these clauses has prompted an important debate between the parties and the legal experts requested by them to discuss the issue, namely Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez.\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider the views of the parties and the experts on this matter, beginning with those of the Claimant.\n\n*32. The Claimant's View of the Treaty's Emergency Clauses*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Treaty clauses provide very narrow and specific exceptions to liability that do not allow the Respondent to invoke the operation of the state of necessity or emergency.\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimant asserts first that under Article 25(2) of the Articles on State Responsibility necessity may not be invoked if the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity. This, in the Claimant's view, is the case here as the object and purpose of the Treaty, which is to provide protection to investors in circumstances of economic difficulty, exclude reliance on such difficulties for nonperformance of the obligations established under the Treaty. Moreover, the Claimant argues, both under the Treaty umbrella clause embodied in Article II(2)(c) and Article X the Respondent has the duty to observe obligations entered into with regard to investments.\n\n338.\n\nThe Claimant invokes in support of its views the **Himpurna** case where *force majeure* was not accepted as precluding the wrongfulness of acts of devaluation and the contractual obligations were upheld even in circumstances of economic adversity.175*Socobelge*,176 on which the **Himpurna** tribunal relied in part, is also invoked by the Claimant as an example of contract enforcement in spite of an economic crisis. To the same effect the Claimant invokes the *Martini* case.177\n\n*Himpurna California Energy Ltd. v. P.T.*, May 4, 1999, as cited in Claimant's Reply, note 403.\n\nPermanent Court of Internacional Justice, *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Com\u00e9rciale de Belgique v. Greece*, 1939, Ser. A/B, No. 78, pars. 167-174.\n\nThe *Martini* case, as cited in Claimant's Reply, at 102-103.\n\n339.\n\nIn connection with the specific clause of Article XI of the Treaty the Claimant, following the expert opinion of Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, argues first that this clause is not self-judging, and therefore requires the Tribunal and not the Respondent to decide when or to what extent essential security interests were at stake. The Claimant makes the further point that if the State were to have discretion in this regard, such discretion should be provided expressly. Provisions of this kind include Article XXI of the GATT as well as provisions in the bilateral investment treaties concluded by the United States with Russia178 and with Bahrain.179 It is further affirmed, that this requirement was also the conclusion of the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case,180 and the *Oil Platforms* case.181\n\nU. S.- Russia Investment Treaty, June 17, 1992, Para. 8 of the Protocol, as cited in Claimant's Reply, note 442. The treaty is not in force.\n\nU. S.-Bahrain Investment Treaty, September 19, 1999, as cited in Claimant's Reply, note 443.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua*, (Merits), ICJ Reports, 1986, at 14, paras. 222, 282; also decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, ICJ Reports, 1984, at 392, para. 83.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms*, Merits, November 6, 2003, para. 43.\n\n340.\n\nThe Claimant argues next that economic crises do not fall within the concept of \"essential security interests,\" which is limited to war, natural disaster and other situations threatening the existence of the State. In its view, this is also the meaning of Article 25 of the\n\nArticles on State Responsibility, the interpretation given to Article XXI of the GATT and the scope of the *Russian Indemnity* case.\n\n341.\n\nA third argument made by the Claimant is that, in any event, Article XI does not exempt the Respondent from liability as this provision does not allow for the denial of benefits under the Treaty.\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimant discusses in this context the meaning of Article IV(3) of the Treaty which, it is argued, is not intended to reduce the obligations of the host state to investors but rather to reinforce such obligations, and cannot be read to include economic emergency. The ICSID cases *American Manufacturing v. Zaire*182 and *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*183 are invoked as precedents supporting this interpretation.\n\n*American Manufacturing and Trade Inc. v. Zaire*, ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, February 21, 1997.\n\n*AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, June 27, 1990.\n\n343.\n\nIt is further argued in this regard that even if the Article were to include economic difficulties the Claimant would still be entitled to full protection under the most favored nation clause (MFNC) of both Articles II(1) and IV(3) of the Treaty, and certainly nothing less than the treatment local investors or those from other countries have received from the Respondent. The MFNC is also invoked in support of the argument that other bilateral investment treaties concluded by the Respondent do not contain provisions similar to Article XI and thus the Claimant is entitled to the better treatment resulting from the absence of such exceptions.\n\n*33. The Respondent's View of the Treaty's Emergency Clauses*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nArticles IV(3) and XI of the Treaty provide, in the Respondent's view, for the *lex specialis* governing emergency situations which the Government has implemented in order to maintain public order, protect its essential security interests and reestablish its connections with the international economic system, all with a view to granting investors treatment not less favorable than that granted to nationals.\n\n345.\n\nThe Respondent argues first that the object and purpose of the Treaty do not exclude the operation of necessity or emergency, which are expressly provided for in periods of distress. To this effect, the Respondent further argues, the decisions invoked by the Claimant in support of its views are not relevant to the present case.\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent particularly rejects the reliance by the Claimant on the tribunal's decision in the **Himpurna** case. The Claimant invoked that decision to draw a comparison with the Indonesian crisis and to show that the tribunal in that case had held that necessity was excluded by specific commitments undertaken by contract and treaty. The present dispute, the Respondent argues, has emerged under circumstances very different from those that prevailed in Indonesia and the **Himpurna** case in no way contradicts the position taken by Argentina in light of extraordinary circumstances.\n\n347.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the relevance of the situation of Greece in the 1930s as taken into account in the decision in the *Socobelge* case. This decision was also invoked by the Claimant to show that the obligations under a contract were upheld in spite of financial hardship, in the case of Greece. The Respondent believes the Argentine crisis to have been much worse and deeper and that *force majeure* as discussed in that case was held to be beyond the powers of the Permanent Court of International Justice.\n\n348.\n\nAs to the *Martini* case, invoked by the Claimant as an example of state of necessity not having been accepted as an excuse and of contractual commitments having been strictly enforced, the Respondent does not consider it relevant to the present case as it did not deal with a case of institutional abnormality.\n\n349.\n\nThe expert opinions of Dean Anne Marie Slaughter, introduced by the Respondent on December 15, 2003 and June 23, 2004, elaborate on the meaning and the coverage of the relevant Treaty articles. It is first asserted in this respect that Article XI of the Treaty needs to be interpreted broadly and this in fact was the intention of the parties.\n\n350.\n\nSince the very outset of the United States' model bilateral investment treaties it has been apparent, in the expert's view, that this country desired to safeguard certain sovereign interests by means of \"non-precluded measures\" such as those of Article XI. This trend was strengthened after the decision in the *Nicaragua* case which held that similar provisions of another treaty could not be understood to be self-judging. At the time the Treaty was signed with Argentina, it is further argued, this trend had become manifest as evidenced by the treaties negotiated with other countries and debates in the United States Congress.\n\n351.\n\nOn the basis of the principle of reciprocity, it is explained next, Argentina should be accorded the benefit of a similar understanding when invoking necessity and emergency. The self-judging character of these provisions, in the expert's view, should not be understood as precluding their submission to arbitration as the Tribunal must determine whether Article XI applies and whether measures taken thereunder comply with the requirements of good faith.\n\n352.\n\nThe expert's opinions also emphasize that security interests include economic security, particularly in the context of a crisis as severe as that of Argentina, and that, as in many instances of *force majeure*, the State should be released from treaty obligations. It is held, moreover, that the Claimant has not been treated differently from nationals or other investors under Article IV(3) of the Treaty.\n\n*34. The Tribunal's Findings in Respect of the Treaty's Clauses on Emergency*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nThe first issue the Tribunal must determine is whether the object and purpose of the Treaty exclude necessity. There are of course treaties designed to be applied precisely in the case of necessity or emergency, such as those setting out humanitarian rules for situations of armed conflict. In those cases, as rightly explained in the Commentary to Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, the plea of necessity is excluded by the very object and purpose of the treaty.184\n\nCrawford, at 185.\n\n354.\n\nThe Treaty in this case is clearly designed to protect investments at a time of economic difficulties or other circumstances leading to the adoption of adverse measures by the Government. The question is, however, how grave these economic difficulties might be. A severe crisis cannot necessarily be equated with a situation of total collapse. And in the absence of such profoundly serious conditions it is plainly clear that the Treaty will prevail over any plea of necessity. However, if such difficulties, without being catastrophic in and of themselves, nevertheless invite catastrophic conditions in terms of disruption and disintegration of society, or are likely to lead to a total breakdown of the economy, emergency and necessity might acquire a different meaning.\n\n355.\n\nAs stated above, the Tribunal is convinced that the Argentine crisis was severe but did not result in total economic and social collapse. When the Argentine crisis is compared to other contemporary crises affecting countries in different regions of the world it may be noted that such other crises have not led to the derogation of international contractual or treaty obligations. Renegotiation, adaptation and postponement have occurred but the essence of the international obligations has been kept intact.\n\n356.\n\nAs explained above, while the crisis in and of itself might not be characterized as catastrophic and while there was therefore not a situation of *force majeure* that left no other option open, neither can it be held that the crisis was of no consequence and that business could have continued as usual, as some of the Claimant's arguments seem to suggest. Just as the Tribunal concluded when the situation under domestic law was considered, there were certain consequences stemming from the crisis. And while not excusing liability or precluding wrongfulness from the legal point of view they ought nevertheless to be considered by the Tribunal when determining compensation.\n\n357.\n\nA second issue the Tribunal must determine is whether, as discussed in the context of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, the act in question does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists. If the Treaty was made to protect investors it must be assumed that this is an important interest of the States parties. Whether it is an essential interest is difficult to say, particularly at a time when this interest appears occasionally to be dwindling.\n\n358.\n\nHowever, be that as it may, the fact is that this particular kind of treaty is also of interest to investors as they are specific beneficiaries and for investors the matter is indeed essential. For the purpose of this case, and looking at the Treaty just in the context of its States parties, the Tribunal concludes that it does not appear that an essential interest of the State to which the obligation exists has been impaired, nor have those of the international community as a whole. Accordingly, the plea of necessity would not be precluded on this count.\n\n359.\n\nThe third issue the Tribunal must determine is whether Article XI of the Treaty can be interpreted in such a way as to provide that it includes economic emergency as an essential security interest. While the text of the Article does not refer to economic crises or difficulties of that particular kind, as concluded above, there is nothing in the context of customary international law or the object and purpose of the Treaty that could on its own exclude major economic crises from the scope of Article XI.\n\n360.\n\nIt must also be kept in mind that the scope of a given bilateral treaty, such as this, should normally be understood and interpreted as attending to the concerns of both parties. If the concept of essential security interests were to be limited to immediate political and national security concerns, particularly of an international character, and were to exclude other interests, for example, major economic emergencies, it could well result in an unbalanced understanding of Article XI. Such an approach would not be entirely consistent with the rules governing the interpretation of treaties.\n\n361.\n\nAgain, the issue is then to establish how grave an economic crisis must be so as to qualify as an essential security interest, a matter discussed above.\n\n362.\n\nIt is true that Paragraph 6 of the Protocol attached to the Treaty qualifies the reference to maintenance or restoration of international peace and security as related to obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. Similarly, the letter of submission of the Treaty to Congress in Argentina and the Report of the pertinent Congressional Committee, refer in particular to situations of war, armed conflict or disturbance.185 However, this cannot be read as excluding altogether other qualifying situations.\n\nLetter from the President of Argentina to Congress submitting the text of the Treaty, January 24, 1992, in C\u00e1mara de Diputados, Reuni\u00f3n No. 70, April 30, 1992, at 6722-6723; Report of the Committees of Foreign Affairs and Worship and Economy, ibid.\n\n363.\n\nSince the Security Council assumes to be many times the law unto itself,186 and since there is no specific mechanism for judicial review under the Charter, it is not inconceivable that in some circumstances this body might wish to qualify a situation of economic crisis as a threat to international peace and security and adopt appropriate measures to deal with a given situation. This would indeed allow for a broad interpretation of Article XI.\n\nAs discussed by an experienced diplomat, \"With no higher authority to gainsay it, threats to international peace and security are what the Security Council says they are\"; Gareth Evans: \"When is it Right to Fight?\", Survival, Vol. 46 (3), 2004, 59-82, at 69.\n\n364.\n\nAs explained by Professor Alvarez, in practice the Security Council has, to a limited extent, adopted decisions connecting economic measures with security matters, for example, in the formulation of the sanctions program enacted as a consequence of the 1991 Gulf War and other instances.187 In such cases, it is explained, there could be a treaty breach under the authority of the Security Council. However, this sort of situation does not have to do with the present case.\n\nStatement by Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, Hearing, Vol. 7, August 17, 2004, at 1633-1637\n\n365.\n\nIt is also important to note that in Dean Slaughter's understanding of the reference to the United Nations in the Treaty Protocol, such clause should not be considered as self-judging to the extent that the issue relates to the maintenance or restoration of international peace and security, involving a broader understanding of the concept as opposed to a nation's own security interest. The latter would in her view allow for self-judging insofar as the security interest is not a part of the maintenance or restoration of international peace and security.188 The question of the self-judging character of these provisions will be discussed next.\n\nStatement by Professor Anne Marie Slaughter, Hearing, Vol. 8, August 18, 2004, at 1947-1949.\n\n366.\n\nThe fourth issue the Tribunal must determine is whether the rule of Article XI of the Treaty is self-judging, that is if the State adopting the measures in question is the sole arbiter of the scope and application of that rule, or whether the invocation of necessity, emergency or other essential security interests is subject to some form of judicial review.\n\n367.\n\nAs discussed above, three positions have emerged in this context. There is first that of the Claimant, supporting the argument that such a clause cannot be self-judging. There is next that of the Respondent, who believes that it is free to determine when and to what extent necessity, emergency or the threat to its security interests need the adoption of extraordinary measures. And third, there is the position expressed by Dean Slaughter to the effect that the Tribunal must determine whether Article XI is applicable particularly with a view to establishing whether this has been done in good faith.189\n\nStatement by Professor Anne Marie Slaughter, Hearing, Vol. 8, August 18, 2004, at 1844.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this connection that, as explained by Dean Slaughter, the position of the United States has been evolving towards the support of self-judging clauses insofar as security interests are affected. This policy emerged after the *Nicaragua* decision, which will be discussed below, and was expressly included in the U.S. - Russia bilateral investment treaty, which has incidentally not been ratified. With some changes it was also included in the U.S. - Bahrain investment treaty, the precise meaning of which is debated by the experts. The GATT self-judging clause was also mentioned above. Other treaties have not included a self-judging clause but this again is debated by the experts, and in any event such policy would also be reflected in the 2004 U.S. Model bilateral investment treaty.\n\n369.\n\nThe discussion of these treaties in the U.S. Congress allows for a variety of interpretations but does not clearly support the conclusion that all such clauses are self-judging. The record shows that during the discussion of the first round of bilateral investment treaties in 1986 a proposal to allow for the termination of treaties in light of security needs was not accepted, although this discussion apparently did not address specifically the question of self-judging clauses. The expert discussion of the Exon-Florio law has also generated much debate on its meaning.190\n\nExon-Florio Amendment to the 1988 Trade Act, 50 USC app. para. 2170, (Supp. 1989). See generally the discussion in Hearing, Vol. 7, August 17, 2004, and Hearing, Vol. 8, August 18, 2004, with particular reference to the discussion by the parties and experts of Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez: \"Political Protectionism and United States International Investment Obligations in Conflict: The Hazards of Exon-Florio\", Virginia Journal of International Law, Vol. 30, 1989, 1.\n\n370.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that when States intend to create for themselves a right to determine unilaterally the legitimacy of extraordinary measures importing non-compliance with obligations assumed in a treaty, they do so expressly. The examples of the GATT and bilateral investment treaty provisions offered above are eloquent examples of this approach. The first does not preclude measures adopted by a party \"which it considers necessary\" for the protection of its security interests. So too, the U.S. - Russia treaty expressly confirms in a Protocol that the non-precluded measures clause is self-judging.\n\n371.\n\nThe International Court of Justice has also taken a clear stand in respect of this issue, twice in connection with the *Nicaragua* case and again in the *Oil Platforms* case noted above. Referring to the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Nicaragua, the Court held:\n\n\"Article XXI defines the instances in which the Treaty itself provides for exceptions to the generality of its other provisions, but it by no means removes the interpretation and application of that article from the jurisdiction of the Court. The text of Article XXI of the Treaty does not employ the wording which was already to be found in Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This provision of GATT, contemplating exceptions to the normal implementation of the General Agreement, stipulates that the Agreement is not to be construed to prevent any contracting party from taking any action \u2018which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests', in such fields as nuclear fission, arms, etc. The 1956 Treaty, on the contrary, speaks simply of \u2018necessary' measures, not of those considered by a party to be such.\"191\n\n*Nicaragua,* 1986, para. 222.\n\n372.\n\nAs explained above, in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* case the International Court of Justice, referring to the work and views of the International Law Commission, notes the strict and cumulative conditions of necessity under international law and that \"the State concerned is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met.\"192\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, pars. 51-52. The reference to the International Law Commission's work is to International Law Commission, Yearbook, 1980, Vol. II (Part Two), at 34-52, para. 36.\n\n373.\n\nIn light of this discussion, the Tribunal concludes first that the clause of Article XI of the Treaty is not a self-judging clause. Quite evidently, in the context of what a State believes to be an emergency, it will most certainly adopt the measures it considers appropriate without requesting the views of any court.193 However, if the legitimacy of such measures is challenged before an international tribunal, it is not for the State in question but for the international jurisdiction to determine whether the plea of necessity may exclude wrongfulness. It must also be noted that clauses dealing with investments and commerce do not generally affect security as much as military events do and, therefore, would normally fall outside the scope of such dramatic events.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Yearbook, 1980, Vol. II (Part Two), at 34-52, para. 36.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal must conclude next that this judicial review is not limited to an examination of whether the plea has been invoked or the measures have been taken in good faith. It is a substantive review that must examine whether the state of necessity or emergency meets the conditions laid down by customary international law and the treaty provisions and whether it thus is or is not able to preclude wrongfulness.\n\n375.\n\nThe Tribunal must still consider the question of the meaning and extent of Treaty Article IV(3) in light of the discussion noted above. The plain meaning of the Article is to provide a floor treatment for the investor in the context of the measures adopted in respect of the losses suffered in the emergency, not different from that applied to nationals or other foreign investors. The Article does not derogate from the Treaty rights but rather ensures that any measures directed at offsetting or minimizing losses will be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner.\n\n376.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal is satisfied that the measures adopted by the Respondent have not adversely discriminated against the Claimant.\n\n377.\n\nAlthough the MFNC contained in the Treaty has also been invoked by the Claimant because other treaties done by Argentina do not contain a provision similar to that of Article XI, the Tribunal is not convinced that the clause has any role to play in this case. Thus, had other Article XI type clauses envisioned in those treaties a treatment more favorable to the investor, the argument about the operation of the MFNC might have been made. However, the mere absence of such provision in other treaties does not lend support to this argument, which would in any event fail under the *ejusdem generis* rule, as rightly argued by the Respondent.\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal must finally conclude in this section that the umbrella clauses invoked by the Claimant do not add anything different to the overall Treaty obligations which the Respondent must meet if the plea of necessity fails.\n\n*35. Temporary Nature of Necessity*\n-----------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful that Article 27 of the Articles on State Responsibility provides that the invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness is without prejudice to \"(a) compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists.\"\n\n380.\n\nThe temporary nature of necessity is thus expressly recognized and finds support in the decisions of courts and tribunals. The Commentary cites in this connection the *Rainbow Warrior*194 and *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* cases. In this last case the International Court of Justice held that as soon \"as the state of necessity ceases to exist, the duty to comply with treaty obligations revives.\"195\n\n*Rainbow Warrior,* RIAA, Vol. XX, 1990, 217, at 251-252, para. 75; Crawford at 189.\n\nCrawford, at 189.\n\n381.\n\nThis does not appear to be contested by the parties as various witness statements did in fact clearly establish that the crisis had been evolving toward normalcy over a period of time. The Claimant invokes to this effect the statements of Ambassador Remes Lenicov and Doctor Folgar, who explained how the crisis was subsiding by the end of 2002.196 This was also the view of the Argentine Supreme Court and the *Procurador General* noted above. It may be observed that this positive trend continued to evolve thereafter.\n\nClaimant's post-hearing brief, at 11.\n\n382.\n\nEven if the plea of necessity were accepted, compliance with the obligation would reemerge as soon as the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer existed, which is the case at present.\n\n*36. Necessity and Compensation*\n--------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nArticle 27 also expressly provides that any circumstance precluding wrongfulness is without prejudice to \"(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question\". Again this conclusion finds support in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* case, where the Court noted that \"Hungary expressly acknowledged that, in any event, such a state of necessity would not exempt it from its duty to compensate its partner.\"197\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, paras. 152-153; Crawford, at 190.\n\n384.\n\nThis criterion was also the basis for the decisions in earlier cases, such as the *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Orinocco* case198 and the *Properties of the Bulgarian Minorities in Greece* case199 invoked by the Claimant, or the *Orr & Laubenheimer* case.200 In these cases the concept of damages appears to have been broader than that of material loss in Article 27.\n\n*Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Orinocco*, 1905, UNRIAA, Vol. X, 184.\n\n*Properties of the Bulgarian Minorities in Greece,*Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1980, Vol. II (Part Two), 34, para. 13, as cited in Claimant's Reply, note 494.\n\n*Orr & Laubenheimer*, June 16, 1900, RSA, Vol. XV, 37, at 40, as cited in Wyler, at 193-194.\n\n385.\n\nThe Respondent has argued in this connection that the *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Orinocco* dealt with a totally different set of issues, all involving illicit acts, and is therefore not relevant to the present case. The Respondent further invokes the *Gould Marketing, Inc.* case, where the Iran-United States Tribunal held that injuries caused as a result of social and economic forces beyond the power of the State to control through due diligence are \"not attributable to the state for purposes of its responding for damages.\"201\n\n*Gould Marketing, Inc.*, Iran-U. S. C. T. Reports, Vol. 3, 147, as cited in Argentina Reply, note 702.\n\n386.\n\nThe Claimant, however, contends that \"[i]n any event, Article XI does not exempt Argentina from liability,\" since it \"provides only a temporary and limited suspension of benefits, and Argentina is still therefore obliged to provide compensation for the permanent losses [...]\".202 It recalls that the Treaty shows a difference between clauses that (a) \"do not preclude or do not impede certain measures\", (b) \"permit a Party clearly to deny treaty benefits\", or (c) \"permit treaty termination\"\u2014Articles XI, I (2) and XIV (2), respectively.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 304.\n\n387.\n\nBecause the Argentine crisis, as explained above, gradually subsided, the Claimant asserts that \"[e]ven assuming that at the beginning of 2002 Argentina was experiencing an emergency of the sort covered by Article XI, Argentina has not demonstrated that the crisis persists today. Argentina's measures promise to remain in effect indefinitely, and [...the Respondent] must therefore compensate CMS for the harm it has suffered, regardless of the applicability of Article XI.\"203\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 307.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimant's reasoning in this respect is supported by Article 27 and the decisions noted above, as well as by the principle acknowledged even in the generality of domestic legal systems: the plea of state of necessity may preclude the wrongfulness of an act, but it does not exclude the duty to compensate the owner of the right which had to be sacrificed. Still more stringent are the requirements of emergency under Argentine case law as discussed above.\n\n389.\n\nThe Respondent contends to the contrary that no compensation is due if the measures in question were undertaken in a state of necessity, under the rule contained in Article XI of the Treaty,204 and that the norm which prescribes that the Parties shall avoid uneven treatment of investors does not otherwise establish a duty to compensate even if the investor had been submitted to unfair or unequal treatment.205\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, paras. 960 et seq.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 981.\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that Article 27 establishes the appropriate rule of international law on this issue. The Respondent's argument is tantamount to the assertion that a Party to this kind of treaty, or its subjects, are supposed to bear entirely the cost of the plea of the essential interests of the other Party. This is, however, not the meaning of international law or the principles governing most domestic legal systems.\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is further reaffirmed by the record. At the hearing the Tribunal put the question whether there are any circumstances in which an investor would be entitled to compensation in spite of the eventual application of Article XI and the plea of necessity.206\n\nHearing, August 18, 2004, Vol. 8, at 1940-1941.\n\n392.\n\nThe answer to this question by the Respondent's expert clarifies the issue from the point of view of both its temporary nature and the duty to provide compensation: while it is difficult to reach a determination as long as the crisis is unfolding, it is possible to envisage a situation in which the investor would have a claim against the government for the compliance with its obligations once the crisis was over; thereby concluding that any suspension of the right to compensation is strictly temporary, and that this right is not extinguished by the crisis events.207\n\nHearing, August 18, 2004, Vol. 8, at 1941-1942.\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, as in the *Gaz de Bordeaux* case, the International Law Commission's Commentary to Article 27 suggests that the States concerned should agree on the possibility and extent of compensation payable in a given case.208\n\nCrawford, at 190.\n\n394.\n\nIt is quite evident then that in the absence of agreement between the parties the duty of the Tribunal in these circumstances is to determine the compensation due. This the Tribunal will do next.\n\n**E. Remedies**\n---------------\n\n*37. The Parties' Submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that its investment has been expropriated by the Respondent without prompt, adequate and effective compensation and that the\\_Respondent has also violated the standards of treatment set out in Article II of the Treaty. The Claimant requests the Tribunal to grant full compensation for these breaches in terms of recovering the fair market value of the investment calculated immediately before the date of expropriation, with interest paid at the rate of six-month certificates of deposit in the United States, compounded semi-annually. The Claimant also undertakes to relinquish title to its shares to the Government of Argentina upon payment of compensation.\n\n396.\n\nTo this end, the Claimant asserts that the fair market value is the price of an asset in a hypothetical market, which in the case of an income-producing asset or \"going concern\" is also the measure of future prospects. The discounted cash flow method (DCF) is favored, in the Claimant's view, in both international finance and international arbitration. It is also asserted that the relevant date of valuation in this case is August 17, 2000. Relying on the Report prepared by its expert, the Claimant submits that the fair market value at that date is US$ 261.1 million in the event that the Government of Argentina decides to take title to CMS' shares in TGN, or US$ 243.6 million in the event that title to the share remains with CMS.209\n\nStatement by Ms. Lucy Reed, 20 August, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 10, at 2211.\n\n397.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the dates and estimates used by the Claimant because it has chosen the worst moments of the crisis to undertake the downside valuation and has not taken into account the sharp decline of all the economic indicators for that period. The Respondent objects in particular to the assumption that no renegotiation will succeed and that the emergency will continue until 2037, as well as to the assumption that income and costs denominated in US dollars will not change. The Respondent also argues that the rate of exchange used between Argentine pesos and U.S. dollars in the valuation process is too high. Other issues raised by the Respondent have been examined above, such as debt restructuring, export tariffs and the duration of the license.\n\n398.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that the DCF method is not appropriate and that it has resulted in gross overvaluation of the shares. In the Respondent's view, the discount rate used in the pesification scenario is also grossly exaggerated. The Respondent argues that a more accurate method is the stock exchange valuation of shares of similarly situated companies. It also asserts that what CMS paid for its shares in 1995 and 1999 was overvalued by 50% and 26.53% respectively at the date of valuation chosen.210 As noted above, the Respondent has not submitted its own valuation.\n\nSee generally the Report of Mr. Fabi\u00e1n Bello on TGN's indebtedness and the Word-Collins Report, June 11, 2004.\n\n*38. The Standards of Reparation under International Law*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nIt is broadly accepted in international law that there are three main standards of reparation for injury: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.211 As this is not a case of reparation due to an injured State, satisfaction can be ruled out at the outset.\n\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UNGA Resolution 56/83, January 28, 2002, Article 34.\n\n400.\n\nRestitution is the standard used to reestablish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed,212 provided this is not materially impossible and does not result in a burden out of proportion as compared to compensation. The Permanent Court of International Justice concluded in the landmark *Chorzow Factory* case that\n\n\"restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it\u2014such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"213\n\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UNGA Resolution 56/83, January 28, 2002, Article 35.\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice, *Chorzow Factory* case, Merits, 1928, Series A No. 17, at 47; and comments by F. V. Garc\u00eda-Amador: The Changing Law of International Claims, Vol. II, 1984, at 578-580.\n\n401.\n\nCompensation is designed to cover any \"financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"214 Quite naturally compensation is only called for when the damage is not made good by restitution.215 The decision in *Lusitania*, another landmark case, held that \"the fundamental concept of \u2018damages' is. reparation for a *loss* suffered; a judicially ascertained *compensation* for wrong. The remedy should be commensurate with the loss, so that the injured party may be made whole.\"216\n\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UNGA Resolution 56/83, January 28, 2002, Article 36.2.\n\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UNGA Resolution 56/83, January 28, 2002, Article 36.1.\n\n*Lusitania,* RIAA, Vol. VII, 1923, p. 32, at 39, emphasis in original; and comments by James Crawford: The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, 2002, at 178 et seq.\n\n402.\n\nThe loss suffered by the claimant is the general standard commonly used in international law in respect of injury to property, including often capital value, loss of profits and expenses.217 The methods to provide compensation, a number of which the parties have discussed, are not unknown in international law. Depending on the circumstances, various methods have been used by tribunals to determine the compensation which should be paid but the general concept upon which commercial valuation of assets is based is that of \"fair market value.\" That concept has an internationally recognized definition which reads as follows:\n\n\"the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arms length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.\"218\n\nJames Crawford: The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, 2002, at 225, para. 21.\n\nInternational Glossary of Business Valuation Terms, American Society of Appraisers, ASA website, June 6, 2001, p.4\n\n403.\n\nIn the case of a business asset which is quoted on a public market, that process can be a fairly easy one, since the price of the shares is determined under conditions meeting the above mentioned definition. However, it happens frequently that the assets in question are not publicly traded and it is then necessary to find other methods to establish fair market value. Four ways have generally been relied upon to arrive at such value. (1) The \"asset value\" or the \"replacement cost\" approach which evaluates the assets on the basis of their \"break-up\" or their replacement cost; (2) the \"comparable transaction\" approach which reviews comparable transactions in similar circumstances; (3) the \"option\" approach which studies the alternative uses which could be made of the assets in question, and their costs and benefits; (4) the \"discounted cash flow\" (\"DCF\") approach under which the valuation of the assets is arrived at by determining the present value of future predicted cash flows, discounted at a rate which reflects various categories of risk and uncertainty.219 The Tribunal will determine later which method it has chosen and why.\n\nDamodaran, \"Investment Valuation\", John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2002, pp.946-949.\n\n404.\n\nDecisions concerning interest also cover a broad spectrum of alternatives, provided it is strictly related to reparation and not used as a tool to award punitive damages or to achieve other ends.220\n\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UNGA Resolution 56/83, January 28, 2002, Article 38.\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider these various options in the light of the present dispute.\n\n*39. Restitution by Means of Negotiation*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nRestitution is by far the most reliable choice to make the injured party whole as it aims at the reestablishment of the situation existing prior to the wrongful act. In a situation such as that characterizing this dispute and the complex issues associated with the crisis in Argentina, it would be utterly unrealistic for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to turn back to the regulatory framework existing before the emergency measures were adopted, nor has this been requested. However, as the Tribunal has repeatedly stated in this Award, the crisis cannot be ignored and it has specific consequences on the question of reparation.\n\n407.\n\nJust as an acceptable rebalancing of the contracts has been achieved by means of negotiation between the interested parties in other sectors of the Argentine economy, the parties are free to further pursue the possibility of reaching an agreement in the context of this dispute. As long as the parties were to agree to new terms governing their relations, this would be considered as a form of restitution as both sides to the equation would have accepted that a rebalancing had been achieved. This was in fact the first major step for the settlement of the dispute in the *Gaz de Bordeaux* case.\n\n*40. Compensation*\n------------------\n\n408.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, cannot leave matters pending until an agreed settlement is reached; this is a matter strictly in the hands of the parties and its outcome is uncertain. In the absence of such agreed form of restitution, the Tribunal must accordingly determine the amount of compensation due.\n\n*41. The Applicable Standard*\n-----------------------------\n\n409.\n\nA first question the Tribunal needs to address is that of the standard of compensation applicable in the circumstances of this dispute. As was the situation in the *Feldman v. Mexico* case,221 the Tribunal is faced with a situation where, absent expropriation under Article IV, the Treaty offers no guidance as to the appropriate measure of damages or compensation relating to fair and equitable treatment and other breaches of the standards laid down in Article II. This is a problem common to most bilateral investment treaties and other agreements such as NAFTA. The Tribunal must accordingly exercise its discretion to identify the standard best attending to the nature of the breaches found.\n\n*Marvin Feldman v. Mexico,* Award of December 16, 2002, 18 *ICSID Review\u2014FILJ* 488 (2003), par. 194.\n\n410.\n\nUnlike the circumstances in the *Feldman* case, however, the Tribunal is persuaded that the cumulative nature of the breaches discussed here is best dealt with by resorting to the standard of fair market value. While this standard figures prominently in respect of expropriation, it is not excluded that it might also be appropriate for breaches different from expropriation if their effect results in important long-term losses. Moreover, precisely because this is not a case of expropriation, the Claimant has offered to transfer its shares in TGN to the Argentine Republic, and the Tribunal will address this question in due course.\n\n*42. The Valuation Method to be Used*\n-------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that the discounted cash flow method it the one that should be retained in the present instance.\n\n412.\n\nFirst of all, the shares of TGN are not publicly traded on a stock exchange or any other public market. The Respondent has argued that, in order to estimate the value of TGN, reference should have been made to TGS, another natural gas transporter, and three other natural gas distributors which were listed on the Argentine stock exchange. However, as noted by Mr. Bello, \"(...) market capitalization in illiquid markets as Argentina is not the most adequate method to value companies (...)\".222 Moreover, as noted also by Mr. Bello, there were significant differences between TGN and those companies regarding asset levels, business segments, financing policy, and other issues. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that this approach would not be appropriate.\n\nExpert Report of Dr. Fabian Bello, June 11, 2004, at 24.\n\n413.\n\nAs to the asset value approach, it would be inappropriate in the present circumstances. CMS is a minority shareholder in TGN which is an ongoing company with a record showing profits.\n\n414.\n\nAs to the comparable transaction approach, the Tribunal has not been provided with any significant evidence of such transactions and it would be a most speculative enterprise to try and determine the compensation due to CMS on that basis.\n\n415.\n\nAs to the option valuation method, it does not appear to be of any help in this case. TGN is a gas transportation company and it is very difficult to imagine what uses or options there could be for gas transmission lines other than to transport gas.\n\n416.\n\nThis leaves the Tribunal with the DCF method and it has no hesitation in endorsing it as the one which is the most appropriate in this case. TGN was and is a going concern; DCF techniques have been universally adopted, including by numerous arbitral tribunals, as an appropriate method for valuing business assets; as a matter of fact, it was used by ENARGAS in its 1996/7 tariff review. Finally, there is adequate data to make a rational DCF valuation of TGN.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that in spite of the disagreement between the parties as to the appropriate application of the valuation method, experts from both sides have shared the view that DCF was the proper method in this case for determining losses that extend through a prolonged period of time.223\n\nMr. John Wood-Collins states: \"DCF valuation, by contrast, is an appropriate and practical approach for the valuation of CMS's interest in TGN\", Valuation Report of 17 June 2002, p.5; Dr. Fabian Bello also states: \"In order to value a company, there's different mechanisms that can be used. I consider that the most adequate ones are those that use the cash flow method, which is the method used by Mr. Wood-Collins because that method is the most effective one, the discounted method\", 19 August, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 9, at 1969. Dr. Bello, however, questions the way Mr. Wood-Collins has proceeded in applying the DCF method; expert report of Dr. Fabi\u00e1n Bello, June 11, 2004, par. 94.\n\n*43. The Valuation of Damages*\n------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nThis leaves the Tribunal with the assessment of the damages claimed. In this task, the Tribunal was greatly helped by the submissions and the testimonies of the experts produced by the Parties in this case. As will be seen below, the Tribunal however is of the view that certain assumptions and arguments of those experts require some adjustments. In its study of those submissions and testimonies, the Tribunal was ably assisted by its own experts, Professors Jacques Fortin and Alix Mandron of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Montreal. The Parties were informed of their appointment and given an opportunity to comment on their analysis of the parties' expert submissions. Those comments were the subject of careful review by the Tribunal. The Tribunal wishes to express its gratitude to all the experts for their contribution.\n\n419.\n\nIn arriving at its own estimates of the value loss suffered by the Claimant, the Tribunal will discuss a number of points mentioned in the experts' reports which it questions. The word \"estimates\" is quite appropriate in trying to establish value loss in a case involving a license valid until 2027. This task is all the more challenging in that, in order to arrive at a value loss, it is necessary to evaluate not only what the years 2000 to 2027 would have been like had TGN's license and regulatory environment remained unchanged but also to foresee what the future holds for TGN under the new (and not completely known) regulatory environment. The uncertainty surrounding Argentina's future economic health, the exchange rate with the US dollar, the evolution of production costs, required future investments for the maintenance of the pipeline system's efficiency and security are only some of the factors to be taken into account.\n\n420.\n\nThis being said, such estimates need not be arbitrary or analogous to a shot in the dark; with the appropriate methodology and the use of reasonable alternative sets of hypotheses, it is possible to arrive at figures which represent a range of values which can be rationally justified, even though there is general agreement that their accurateness can only be fully assessed some 22 years later.\n\n*44. Methodology Used*\n----------------------\n\n421.\n\nAs already stated, all the experts consulted on this matter agree that the best methodology to be used in a case like the one before the Tribunal is the discounted cash flow methodology and the Tribunal shares that conclusion.\n\n422.\n\nAs far as the parties are concerned, Mr. Wood-Collins is the only expert to have estimated the value loss suffered by CMS on its TGN's shares. In doing so, he used the forecasted figures prepared by TGN for internal use in 2000, in the context of an unchanged regulatory environment. From this basis, he produced two scenarios, one for the \"no regulatory change\" context (or \"without pesification,\" as the Tribunal will describe it) and the other for the \"new regulatory context\" (or \"with pesification\"). The use of a company's internal forecast prepared in the normal course of business is quite acceptable as a starting point in the valuation of a company. The Tribunal sees no reason to reject it.\n\n423.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal will wish to revisit some the more crucial assumptions contained in those scenarios, some of which were questioned in Mr. Bello's report. But before doing so, the Tribunal will address a preliminary issue raised by Mr. Bello concerning the capital structure of TGN and the opportunity for debt renegotiation.\n\n*45. Optimal Capital Structure and Debt Renegotiation*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nMr. Bello has argued, both in his report and in his oral testimony, that an excessive level of debt was partly responsible for the precipitous drop in TGN's value, that TGN would not have defaulted on its obligations had it been less indebted and, finally, that the probable terms of an agreement with the lenders should be considered to compute the true value of CMS's share in TGN.\n\n425.\n\nMr. Bello's argument raises two questions: (1) whether or not the degree of indebtedness affected the size of the equity value loss; and (2) whether the issue of renegotiation needs to be considered in order to assess the equity value loss. The answer of the Tribunal to those two questions is in the negative.\n\n426.\n\nAs to the first question, the Tribunal believes that, even if TGN had maintained a much lower debt ratio than the 50.3% it had in 2000, its shares would have lost the same value because of Argentina's decision (in absolute terms, not in relative terms), except under extremely adverse circumstances. In fact, contrary to what Mr. Bello assumes, in extremely adverse situations, the absolute value loss is smaller, not higher, with a highly leveraged capital structure. It can easily be demonstrated that, in that case, the shareholders of such a company may suffer smaller absolute losses in adverse times (compared with the shareholders of a less leveraged company), because of their limited liability.\n\n427.\n\nSince the problem at hand is not the percentage loss but the absolute value loss suffered by the Claimant as a shareholder, the issue of TGN's \"excessive\" leverage does not need to be considered. There is no firm ground to believe that the absolute change in value of those shares would have been smaller had TGN opted for less debt in its capital structure before 2000, quite the contrary.\n\n428.\n\nMoreover, the evidence put before the Tribunal does not indicate that TGN's debt/equity ratio was significantly different from the one commonly found in pipeline companies; the Tribunal sees no reason why it should be questioning the TGN decisions taken in this regard in the normal course of business. For the purpose of its analysis, the Tribunal will endorse the 50% debt/equity ratio adopted by Mr. Wood-Collins in his scenario.\n\n429.\n\nAs to the question of debt renegotiation, the Tribunal is also of the view that it can be ignored in the present case because, whichever way one looks at the future, shareholders will bear the consequences of the current default, except in the most improbable circumstances where the creditors would renounce repayments that had come due. The Tribunal cannot envisage such gross inefficiency or irrationality in the market. On the contrary, in the real world, creditors would require to be paid first, one way or the other, at the expense of the shareholders. Moreover, since the Claimant has offered to transfer its shares in TGN to the Respondent, upon payment of compensation, the Respondent would stand to benefit after the transfer of shares if, as argued by the Respondent, a favorable renegotiation were eventually to be concluded.\n\n*46. Computing the Value of Equity*\n-----------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThere are two recognized ways of computing the value of a firm and its securities on a DCF basis. One can start computations with the cash flows to the firm before interest and debt repayments, discount such flows at the weighted average cost of capital (the \"WACC\") and add the discounted cash flows to the firm to establish its value; then, the value of debt is subtracted and the residual value is the value of equity (\"the indirect equity value\"). Alternatively, one can compute first the cash flows to equity (cash flows from operations, minus interest and debt repayments), discount them at the cost of equity (\"COE\") and add the discounted cash flows to equity to establish the value of equity (\"the direct equity value\"); then, one adds the value of debt to establish the value of the firm. The Tribunal has been advised that, by and large, analysts have tended to favor the first method. This is the approach taken by Mr. Wood-Collins but he appears to have applied it in a circular way. Having computed the cash flows to equity and the cash flows to creditors, he then adds them up and discounts them at the weighted average cost of capital (the \"WACC\"); the sum of these discounted cash flows represents the value of the firm, from which the value of the debt is subtracted to arrive at the present value of equity. In fact, Mr. Wood-Collins goes from equity to debt to the firm and then back to equity.\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see the need for this detour and shares the view of its own experts that having computed the cash flows to equity, Mr. Wood-Collins needed then only to discount them at the cost of equity (\"COE\") to obtain the present value of TGN's equity.\n\n432.\n\nThe distinction between the two methods of computing value is not a purely academic matter. In general, under the first method, the computed value is larger than under the second one, because the WACC implicitly assumes that shareholders and creditors will receive a proportional share (according to the weights included in the WACC) of the firm's cash flows. Such appears to be the case when cash flows to the firm are larger than, or equal to what the creditors are due and such was the result of the calculations made by Mr. Wood-Collins in this case, where the Tribunal has calculated, on the basis of Mr. Wood-Collins' hypotheses, a net difference of some USD$40 million between the two methods.\n\n433.\n\nIn making its own calculations, the Tribunal will use the second method (the direct equity value).\n\n*47. The Tribunal's Evaluation of Damages*\n------------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nNotwithstanding the reservations expressed above, the Tribunal is of the view that the general approach of Mr. Wood-Collins to the evaluation of damages suffered by the Claimant remains a valid one. However, as will be seen, the Tribunal will apply a number of changes to his assumptions.\n\n435.\n\nSince the Tribunal was not provided with the algorithms sustaining the figures contained in the TGN forecast prepared in 2000, the Tribunal, with the help of its experts, has built its own model; it then tested its model by applying the same hypotheses as the ones embedded in Mr. Wood-Collins' forecasts of equity cash flows. The Tribunal obtained essentially the same results as Mr. Wood-Collins would have obtained, had he applied the direct equity valuation method to his own data.\n\n436.\n\nFrom that model, the Tribunal tested a number of scenarios by changing different variables; the Tribunal focused on the most important determinants of value (as well as the main sources of uncertainty). Not surprisingly, depending on the choices of variables to which changes were made and the size of such changes, significantly disparate results were reached. Some, like a reduction of the discount rate under the \"with pesification\" scenario, produced a rather small decrease in value loss, if Mr. Wood-Collins' revenue forecast were maintained at the pessimistic level he has selected. However, as soon as modest rates of sales growth and an upward tariff revision every five years were assumed, the value loss was significantly decreased.\n\n437.\n\nHowever, all other things being equal, assumptions about ENARGAS' tariff decisions and about additional investments and operations and maintenance costs under the \"no pesification\" case have an even larger impact.\n\n438.\n\nUnder the \"no pesification\" case, the crucial factors would have been ENARGAS' decisions about tariff revisions and investments. Under that scenario, the question is: \"Would ENARGAS have lowered tariffs to keep the rate of return on equity within reasonable bounds?\" In contrast, in the \"pesification\" case, the question is: \"Would ENARGAS raise tariffs to provide shareholders with a positive return?\" To a large extent, the estimate of value loss depends on the answer to these two questions.\n\n*48. The Modifications to Mr. Wood-Collins' Assumptions*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i) The Duration of the Contract*\n---------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nFor the reasons previously mentioned, the Tribunal has eliminated the ten year potential extension of the License to 2037. In the Tribunal's calculations, the License expires in 2027. Under the Tribunal's assumptions, this decision leads to a reduction by some US$ 10 million of the value loss suffered by CMS.\n\n*ii) The Reference Years for Valuation*\n---------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nMr. Wood-Collins computes the changes in share value between August 2000 and May 2002 (in his first report) and December 2003 (in his second report). The Tribunal has concluded that, it would be more logical and mathematically correct to assess the value lost by shares as of a single date. Moreover, as a consequence of this decision, the large discrepancy noted between the TGN and Wood-Collins forecasted (US$ 73 million) and the actual (US$ 36 million) capital expenditures for 2001 (a proportional discrepancy for 2002, 2003 and 2004 would be likely) becomes a non-issue; in using August 2000 as the reference point, all the investments budgeted are assumed to have taken place and \"justify\" the revenues forecast for all the years up to 2027. The negative drag crated by the \"theoretical\" investments is compensated by the boost caused by a long series of \"theoretical\" (boosted) revenues.\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded, in this regard, that the date to be relied upon for the computation of values (with and without pesification) will be August 17, 2000, the day before the Argentine court action referred to above was taken. In order to arrive at the value at that date under the pesification scenario, the Tribunal has used Mr. Wood-Collins' forecast for 2000-2002 under the without pesification scenario and subtracted the amount resulting from the non-indexation under PPI, as it appears in the relevant TGN Annual Reports & Accounts, non-indexation being the sole factor at play during that period.\n\n*iii) The Demand for Gas and Revenues*\n--------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nIn discussing the demand for gas, the Tribunal has only addressed the issue of domestic sales. The export sales have been kept as forecasted by Mr. Wood-Collins.\n\n443.\n\nUnder the no pesification scenario, Mr. Wood-Collins assumes that the major economic crisis suffered by Argentina would have had no negative impact on the demand for gas transported by TGN and that there would be a 2.5% yearly increase until 2007 (a combination of increased volume, until the pipeline is fully utilized, and indexation to PPI) and then a regular 1.5% increase in prices (PPI adjustment) every year until the end of the license.\n\n444.\n\nThe Tribunal believes it would be inappropriate to assume that the demand for gas would have remained stable, had the tariffs been set in US dollars despite the economic crisis. CMS has argued that since at least some of its contracts were on ship-or-pay basis, its revenues would not have been affected by a reduction in demand; but, taking into account the magnitude of the crisis faced by Argentina, it would be highly unrealistic to assume that some adjustments to those ship-or-pay contracts would not have been made between the parties concerned. In any event, if such adjustments had not been made, the net result would have meant that the peso price of transportation would have more than tripled, with the consequential impact on the final consumer's bills and use of gas. Already, in its 2001 Annual Report & Accounts, TGN mentions that \"The year 2001 was strongly influenced by Argentina's economic crisis which drove the company's production decrease and the postponement of investment in different industry sectors which resulted in a stagnation of consumption. Industrial and residential consumption decreased by 5% and 1.5% respectively as compared with the prior year.\" (p.32). Residential consumption representing only 22% of the gas transported by TGN,224 the overall decline in domestic demand would have been around\\_4%. This was for 2001, the year during which the Argentine GDP declined by 4.4%225 and while the application of the PPI was suspended. It is true that, between 2000 and 2001, the sales revenues remained stable but this was probably the result of an increase in export revenues. The GDP declined a further 10.9% in 2002.\n\nStatement of Mr. Nigel Blackaby, August 20, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 10, at 2183.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit, Argentina Country Report, March 2005, p. 7, www.eiu.com.\n\n445.\n\nIt is difficult to believe that, with a tripling of the gas transportation costs under the no pesification scenario, there would not have been a further reduction in demand and/or a significant rise in delinquent accounts, with its consequent impact upon TGN's cash flows. To figure a more precise impact of such a situation upon the volume of gas transported by TGN, and on its revenues, studies of the Argentine elasticity of demand with respect to gas prices would be needed. No such study has been produced.\n\n446.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that it is reasonable to assume that sales revenues would have decreased by 5% in each of 2002 and 2003 and by 1% in 2004. This would reflect the delayed impact of the decline of the Argentine GDP in 2001(-4.4%) and 2002 (-10.9%), somewhat mitigated by the maintenance of the non-pesification of export revenues which continued in addition to be adjusted to the PPI. On the other hand, in 2003 and 2004, the Argentine GDP rose significantly, by 8.8% and 7.8% respectively.226 It would be normal that that turnaround would manifest itself in an increase in the industrial and residential demand for gas. Moreover, there would have been, by the end of 2004, an excess capacity of some 19% (6% original surplus capacity existing in 2001 plus 13% additional capacity created by the reduced demand between 2002 - 2004). The Tribunal is of the view that a gradual increase in demand over the following years would have taken place until full capacity would have been achieved in TGN's pipelines. The Tribunal has therefore forecasted an increase in sales of 3% in 2005, 6% in each of 2006, 2007and 2008, 4.5% in 2009, 3.5% in 2010 and 3% in 2011. This would allow for the full recuperation of the excess capacity in the gas transportation system of TGN. Thereafter, the sales would only increase by 1.5% each year under the PPI formula.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit, Argentina Country Report, March 2005, p. 7, www.eiu.com.\n\n447.\n\nThen, under the pesification regime, Mr. Wood-Collins has assumed 0% increase in revenues until 2027. The Tribunal does not find this assumption realistic. While the price for gas would probably not have been adjusted during the crisis and the first few years following it, it is reasonable to assume that, with pesification, there would have been a gradual absorption of most of the surplus capacity in TGN's pipeline system. The Tribunal has therefore provided for a 1% yearly increase in sales revenues between 2003 and 2008 inclusive. Then, it is also fair to assume that, taking into account the rate of inflation in Argentina, ENARGAS would have allowed some adjustment to the tariff. The Tribunal notes that, although Argentina has known a decline to 4.4% of its rate of inflation in 2004, it had rates of 25.9% in 2002 and 13.4% in 2003.227 While it is to be hoped that the declining trend will continue, there is obviously no guarantee to that effect.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit, Argentina Country Report, March 2005, p. 7, www.eiu.com.\n\n448.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal has introduced in its scenario, from 2008, a very moderate yearly increase of 1.5% in the tariff.\n\n*iv) The Exchange Rate*\n-----------------------\n\n449.\n\nUnder the pesification scenario, Mr. Wood-Collins has assumed a peso exchange rate to the US dollar of 3.59. This was indeed the rate prevalent at the time he did his first valuation in 2002, but there has been since then an appreciable improvement in the peso rate. For the last year, it has moved between 2.90 and 2.97. In these circumstances, the Tribunal has concluded that it would be appropriate to fix an exchange rate of 2.97 as fairly representative of what the value of the peso could be expected to be in a stabilizing or a reasonably stable environment.\n\n*v) The Equity Discount Rate*\n-----------------------------\n\n450.\n\nUnder the pesification scenario, Mr. Wood-Collins has assumed an equity discount rate of 45.04% when valuing from May 2002 to the end of 2037 and of 41.05% when valuing from January 1, 2004 to the end of 2037. Under the no pesification scenario, a discount rate of 13.45% was used. The Tribunal finds the first rate excessive and the second too low.\n\n451.\n\nUnder the first scenario, Mr. Wood-Collins bases his figures on the cost of defaulted securities in May 2002 and in December 2003. Because of that default, their value was low compared with their nominal value, yielding therefore a very high rate of discount. But proceeding this way is implicitly assuming that TGN will, until 2027, repeatedly live through shocks of the same magnitude as the pesification shock. The impact of that measure is already impounded in the cash flows being valued, pesified tariffs translating into much lower dollar cash flows. That negative event has taken place and has had its negative impact upon cash flow, current and future, but some kind of normalcy should rule in the future. Already, there are encouraging signs in that regard in the Argentine economy.\n\n452.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal has concluded that an equity discount rate of 18% would be a reasonable assumption under the pesification scenario.\n\n453.\n\nUnder the second scenario, the Tribunal estimates that the proposed discount rate of 13.45% should be increased to 14.5%.\n\n454.\n\nTo arrive at the first figure, Mr. Wood-Collins used a \"risk-free\" rate of 5.94%, a country-risk premium of 5.21% based on the country-risk premium of TGN's debt over the US Treasury rate and a 2,296% equity risk premium (market equity risk premium of 5.6% multiplied by TGN's beta factor of 0.41). It appears that Mr. Wood-Collins has in fact equated the country risk premium on equity and the country risk premium on TGN's debt. While it is true that the risk borne by shareholders is also borne by debtholders, it is well recognized that shareholders bear a significantly larger risk, because their claims are residual. Mr. Wood-Collins argues that ENARGAS in its 1997 tariff review had settled on a cost of equity very close to the one computed by him. It is quite understandable that, in setting the equity country risk, a State regulatory agency would adopt a conservative approach; first of all, such an agency would wish to project a positive image of that country as a foreign investment venue and, secondly, the higher the cost of equity it would set, the higher the tariff would be. The Tribunal also notes that the equity rate of return adopted by ENARGAS in the 1996-1997 tariff review was 16%228 and that, for the 2002 review which was never completed, a rate of 15% was envisaged by ENARGAS.229\n\nRebuttal Statement of witness for CMS Mr. T. Miller, March 16, 2004, p.5.\n\nStatement by Ms. Lucy Reed, August 9, 2004, Hearing, Volume 1, at 28.\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, taking into account the historical evidence on the economic and political performance of Argentina and the above facts, the cost of the equity investment made by the Claimant should be increased from 13.45% to 14.5%.\n\n*vi) The Tariff Adjustments*\n----------------------------\n\n456.\n\nUnder the no pesification scenario, Mr. Wood-Collins assumes an average yearly rate of revenue increase of 2.5% up to 2007 and of 1.5% thereafter. However, this leads to very high rates of return gradually increasing from about 20% in 2012 to close to 100% in 2027. The Claimant argues that those rates of return would allow a catch-up for lower rates of return in earlier years. While the Tribunal is willing to concede that a certain amount of recuperation might have been allowed by ENARGAS, it is difficult to conceive that it could have tolerated the kind of escalation described above, without making downward adjustments to the tariff on the occasion of its Five Year Reviews starting in 2013. Therefore, the Tribunal has decided to introduce a 5% decrease in tariffs at the time of each of the tariff reviews in 2013, 2018 and 2023. This still leaves growth in the return on equity which amply covers the catch-up mentioned by the Claimant.\n\n457.\n\nUnder the pesification scenario, Mr. Wood-Collins assumes that there will be no increase in tariffs for the whole duration of the License. The Tribunal considers this hypothesis unrealistic. It has received evidence that Argentina has already offered to TGN a 7% tariff increase, albeit accompanied by some conditions that have been turned down by TGN. With the disappearance of the US PPI adjustment, it would be strange to say the least that TGN would be left in a situation where, as forecasted by Mr. Wood-Collins, its domestic sales revenue would remain completely flat for the next 22 years; under that scenario, TGN's equity remains negative until 2023 (according to Mr. Wood-Collins' report of May 22, 2002) or until 2019 (according to his March 19, 2004, report). Here again, it is difficult to believe that TGN would not have been able to convince ENARGAS that this was an unacceptable situation and that some increase in the tariff was required on the occasion of its Five Year Reviews. The Tribunal has already indicated that, in its forecast, it has allocated a yearly increase of 1.5% in the tariff from 2008 to take account of Argentine inflation. The Tribunal also concludes that, starting in 2008, a 5% increase on the occasion of each Five Year Review should be assumed, in order to advance the moment when TGN could again be equity positive.\n\n*vii) Operations and Maintenance Expenditures (\"O&M\")*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n458.\n\nIn its report, Mr. Wood-Collins projects the following percentages to sales for O&M: 10.20% to the end of 2004, 9.40% to the end of 2014, 8.40% to the end of 2020 and 7% to the end of 2037. The Tribunal considers those projections too conservative for three reasons.\n\n459.\n\nTo begin with, they are significantly below the levels which were achieved during the years previous to 2002.\n\n460.\n\nSecondly during a period of steep decline in sales, it would be unrealistic to expect that there would not be an appreciable increase in the proportion of O&M to sales. There is significant amount of rigidity in this type of expenditures in a regulated industry where the maintenance of safety has to be paramount.\n\n461.\n\nThirdly, even when growth in sales has returned, the requirements for safety do not decrease and with aging equipment, maintenance expenditures will tend to rise rather than decline.\n\n462.\n\nHowever, noting the fact that sales are expected to increase over the years after 2005, the Tribunal is willing to recognize that there would be a certain decline in the percentage of O&M but it is not ready to endorse as steep a decline as the one envisaged by Mr. Wood-Collins. Consequently, the Tribunal has adopted the following percentages for O&M in its scenario: 11.5% to the end of 2004, 11.00% to the end of 2014, 10.00% to the end of 2020 and 8% to the end of 2027.\n\n*viii) Other Hypotheses*\n------------------------\n\n463.\n\nA number of other factors were part of Mr. Wood-Collins scenario and the Tribunal sees no valid reason to modify those. We refer, in particular, to US$ export sales, tax rate, depreciation, interest tax rate, target debt ratio and additional capital expenditures.\n\n*ix) Value of the Shares*\n-------------------------\n\n464.\n\nThe Claimant has requested an order that \"Argentina compensate CMS in the amount of $261.1 million in the event that (...) Argentina determines to take CMS's shares in TGN or $243.6 million in the event that title to the shares remain remains with CMS,\"230 which attributes a value of US$17.5 million to those shares. This last amount represents the value of those shares on May 29, 2002.\n\nStatement by Ms. Lucy Reed, 20 August, 2004, Hearing, Vol. 10, at 2211.\n\n465.\n\nAsking for the value of the shares remitted to the Government of Argentina is a legitimate claim, so long as CMS is ready to transfer to the Respondent the title to those shares, which it has indicated willingness to do.\n\n466.\n\nThe question remains whether the amount claimed for the value of the shares is the correct one. On the basis of the scenario relied upon by the Tribunal, as described above, the value of the shares is significantly lower than the one claimed by CMS. The Tribunal has arrived at a value of US$7,443,700, on August 17, 2000. In addition, from that value, one has to deduct any dividend received by CMS after 17 August 2000, as it would otherwise be doubly compensated. According to the 2001 TGN Annual Report & Accounts (pp. 48 and 51), TGN made two dividend distributions of US$9 million each after that date. On the basis of a 29.42% share ownership in the company, the Claimant did receive a total of US$5,295,600. This leaves a net value of US$2,148,100 for CMS' shares in TGN on August 17, 2000. Additional amounts, if any, received by CMS since August 17, 2000, as equity holder in TGN should also be deducted from the residual value just mentioned.\n\n467.\n\nAs the dividends paid were deducted from the shares value, in order to avoid double counting, the counter point that interest from August 17, 2000 should be paid equally holds and the Tribunal will so order.\n\n*49. Amount of Compensation for Damages and Value of the Shares*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nAfter the modifications mentioned above, the Tribunal arrives at a DCF loss valuation of US$133.2 million for the Claimant, on August 17, 2000, representing the compensation owed in that regard by the Respondent to the Claimant at that date.\n\n469.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant must transfer to the Respondent the ownership of its shares in TGN, upon payment by the Respondent of the additional sum of US$2,148,100. Additional amounts, if any, to the US$5,295,600 already received by CMS as dividends, which would have been received by it in its capacity of shareholder should be deducted from the price to be paid by Argentina, when it exercises its right to buy those shares. On the other hand, the Tribunal does not consider that it would be appropriate to leave that option open-ended; it therefore rules that the Government of Argentina will have a time limit of one year from the date of this Award to purchase CMS' shares in TGN.\n\n*50. Interest*\n--------------\n\n470.\n\nThe Claimant has requested that the interest should be set at the average rate applicable to U.S. six-month certificates of deposit, compounded semi-annually starting on August 18, 2000.\n\n471.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that the U.S. Treasury Bills rate is more appropriate under the circumstances and that the interest should be simple for the period extending from August 18, 2000, to 60 days after the date of this decion or the date of effective payment if before. For this period the interest rate shall be 2.51% which corresponds to the annualized average rate for the U.S. Treasury Bills as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.231 Thereafter, the interest shall be the arithmetic average of the six-month U.S. Treasury Bills' rates observed on the afore-mentioned date and every six months thereafter, compounded semi-annually. That amount shall be calculated from the same source as the one mentioned above. Interest shall apply to both the value loss suffered by CMS and the residual value of its shares.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Series \"6 month t. Bill, Secondary Market Rates, Weekly.\"\n\n*51. Costs of the Proceedings*\n------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nEach party shall bear the expenses incurred by it in connection with the present arbitration. The arbitration costs, including the fees of the members of the Tribunal, shall be borne in equal shares by the parties.\n\nNOW THEREFORE THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL DECIDES AND AWARDS AS FOLLOWS\n\n1. The Respondent breached its obligations to accord the investor the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed in Article II (2) (a) of the Treaty and to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II (2) (c) of the Treaty.\n\n2. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant compensation in the amount of US$133.2 million.\n\n3. Upon payment of the compensation decided in this Award, the Claimant shall transfer to the Respondent the ownership of its shares in TGN upon payment by the Respondent of the additional sum of US$2,148,100. The Respondent shall have up to one year after the date this Award is dispatched to the parties to accept such transfer.\n\n4. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant simple interest at the annualized average rate of 2.51% of the United States Treasury Bills for the period August 18, 2000 to 60 days after the date of this Award, or the date of effective payment if before, applicable to both the value loss suffered by the Claimant and the residual value of its shares established in 2 and 3 above. However, the interest on the residual value of the shares shall cease to run upon written notice by Argentina to the Claimant that it will not exercise its option to buy the Claimant's shares in TGN. After the date indicated above, the rate shall be the arithmetic average of the six-month U.S. Treasury Bills rates observed on the afore-mentioned date and every six months thereafter, compounded semi-annually.\n\n5. Each party shall pay one half of the arbitration costs and bear its own legal costs.\n\n6.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 September 2005, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\" or \"the Respondent\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes an application in writing requesting the annulment of an Award dated 12 May 2005 rendered by the Tribunal in the arbitration between CMS Gas Transmission Company (\"CMS\" or \"the Claimant\") and the Argentine Republic.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"). In it, the Respondent sought annulment of the Award on two of the five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically that: the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers and that the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n3.\n\nThe Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 27 September 2005 and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 30 September 2005, the Claimant made a request under Arbitration Rule 54(2) for the stay of enforcement of the Award to be terminated unless Argentina were to provide adequate assurances as to the payment of the Award should its application for annulment fail.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 18 April 2006, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee (the Committee) had been constituted, composed of Judge Gilbert Guillaume from France, Judge Nabil Elaraby from Egypt and Professor James R. Crawford from Australia. On the same date the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 20 April 2006, the parties were notified that Judge Gilbert Guillaume had been designated President of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 2 May 2006, the Centre sent to the parties copies of the Declarations signed by each Member of the Committee pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2).\n\n9.\n\nThe parties disagreed on the effects of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award over Argentina\u2019s option to purchase CMS\u2019s shares on Transportadora de Gas del Norte (TGN) provided for in item No. 3 of the *dispositif* of the Award.\n\n10.\n\nAfter due deliberation, the Committee decided that, since the payment of compensation has been stayed, the condition precedent to the transfer of shares in TGN for the time being could not be met and thus the time limit set forth in the Award for such transfer had been likewise provisionally stayed. The decision of the Committee was notified to the parties by the Secretariat on 10 May 2006.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 16 May 2006, the Argentine Republic requested that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award be continued until the Committee had the opportunity to hear from both parties on the matter. By letter of that same date, the Claimant reiterated its request that the stay be discontinued unless adequate assurances were provided by the Argentine Republic that it would comply with the Award in the event its annulment application was rejected.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 17 May 2006, the Committee informed the parties of its decision to continue the stay of the Award until 5 June 2006 (the date previously fixed for the first session of the Committee with the parties).\n\n13.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, as scheduled with the agreement of the parties, on 5 June 2006, at the premises of the World Bank in Paris, France, and several issues of procedure were agreed and decided. During the session, both parties addressed the Committee with their arguments on the question of the continuance of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nAfter having heard those arguments, the Committee requested a written statement on behalf of Argentina, within seven days, with respect to its compliance with the Award under the ICSID Convention in the event that the Award not be annulled. It further decided that it would be open to CMS to comment within the further seven days on such statement. At the same time, it decided to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award until it had taken a decision.\n\n**B. The Parties\u2019 contentions**\n-------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nIn its application of 8 September 2005, the Argentine Republic requests \"that enforcement of the Award be stayed pending the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision\" on annulment. In its view, to permit the Award to be enforced in the meantime \"would irreparably harm Argentina.\" By contrast, \"staying enforcement of the Award would not prejudice CMS.\" It adds that \"Argentina has compelling grounds for annulment\" and that \"a stay is in the public interest.\"\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 30 September 2005, CMS expressed the view that the provisional stay of enforcement should not be continued \"unless Argentina provides adequate assurances (such as the provision of an irrevocable and unconditional bank guarantee in favour of CMS) as to the payment of the Award, should its application for annulment fail.\"\n\n17.\n\nAfter various exchanges of correspondence, CMS, in its letter dated 16 May 2006, reiterates its previous submissions. It recalls the provisions of Articles 53(1) of the ICSID Convention and Articles 52(5) and 54(2) of the ICSID Rules. It referrs to the decision rendered on 1 June 2005 by an *ad hoc* Committee in the *MTD* v. *Chile* case, stressing, in particular, that Committee\u2019s statement that a \"Respondent seeking a remedy under the Convention should demonstrate that for its part it will comply with the Convention, and if there is doubt in that regard, the Committee may order the provision of a bank guarantee as a condition of a stay.\"1\n\nMTD Equity Sdn.

Republic of Chile (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7); Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s on the Respondent\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Execution of June 1, 2005, available online at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/MTD.pdf.\n\n18.\n\nCMS contended that Argentina had never given any assurance that it would satisfy the Award voluntarily if its annulment application failed. It submitted that, on the contrary, Argentina had consistently expressed its intention to subject final ICSID Awards \"to a novel domestic review mechanism before the Argentine Supreme Court (or other fora) in open breach of its obligations under the ICSID Convention\". In support of this submission, it quoted declarations made by Dr. Horacio Rosatti, Dr. Roberto Lavagna and Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino. It added that \"Any suggestion from Argentina that it would suffer if the provisional stay were lifted... or that it is unable to fund a bank guarantee cannot be taken seriously in the light of its current economic situation.\"\n\n19.\n\nIn its letter dated 26 May 2006, Argentina submitted that, under Argentine law, treaties prevail over acts of the Congress and Executive Branch decisions. In this respect it mentioned the judgment rendered in 1992 by the Supreme Court of Argentina in *Ekmekdjian* v. *Sofovitch* and the constitutional reform of 1994 relating to Article 75 \u00a722 of the Constitution. Argentina also pointed out that it had \"always abided by awards issued by [international] tribunals\" dealing with conflicts with other states, as well as in cases referred to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\n\n20.\n\nArgentina noted that the ICSID Convention itself imposes no obligation to post a bond as a condition for the continuance of enforcement of an award under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. In support of this contention, it mentioned the decisions of the *ad hoc* Committees in *Mine v. Guinea2* and *MTD* v. *Chile.* It added that the fee to be charged by an international bank for granting a guarantee as the one requested by CMS would be extremely high and that the shares owned by CMS in TGN are an additional guarantee of execution of the Award. It observed that, \"by posting a bond, claimant would then be placed in a far more favourable position than it enjoyed before the filing of the application for annulment.\" Finally, it noted that \"the grounds for annulment of the award in this case are serious, substantial and present unprecedented issues.\" Argentina concluded by requesting the Committee \"to maintain the stay of the execution of the award in these proceedings, without requiring any bond.\"\n\nMaritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4)\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 1 June 2006, CMS transmitted to the Committee a dossier of press reports \"containing additional illustrative statements by Argentine officials that reflect Argentina\u2019s intention not to execute the award voluntarily.\"\n\n22.\n\nAt the oral hearings, the Parties reiterated and developed their written arguments and maintained their previous submissions.\n\n23.\n\nArgentina added that it had signed 54 bilateral investment treaties and that, prior to the 2002 crisis, only five cases had been submitted to ICSID arbitration. Of these, four had been withdrawn by the investors after an agreement had been reached, and the last one was still pending. After this crisis, there were 35 ICSID cases and 5 UNCITRAL cases (25% of those cases having been withdrawn or suspended by agreement between the Parties). It affirmed that Argentina has always complied with all its pecuniary obligations under decisions of international tribunals and in accordance with the settlement of cases before international tribunals.\n\n24.\n\nCMS recalled at the hearing that five of the eight *ad hoc* Committees which had to face the question of stay of enforcement \"have ordered assurances in the forms of a guarantee for continuance of the stay... [In] the other three cases, the Committee found exceptional circumstances justifying going forward without some sort of guarantee or bond.\" It observed, in the terms of *MTD v. Chile* award, that there is a doubt in the present case as to whether Argentina will comply with the ICSID Convention in the event the Award is not annulled by the Committee. Indeed there have been many statements by Argentine officials suggesting that \"any adverse ICSID award will be subject to a Supreme Court review or that the matter will be submitted to the International Court of Justice.\" CMS contended that under the Argentine Constitution as revised in 1994, only \"human right treaties have an equivalent effect to the Constitution.\"\n\n25.\n\nIn response to a question, Argentina specified that under Argentine law, all international treaties ratified by Argentina are automatically given legal effect, without any need for further incorporation. It added that, in the *Ekmedjian* judgement, the Supreme Court did not distinguish between statutory and constitutional provisions and affirmed in general terms that international law prevails over domestic law. Argentina recognized that CMS is \"a serious investor\" and that the award rendered in its case could not be considered as \"extraordinarily arbitrary.\" It solemnly declared \"In the case that the Committee confirms the award, we are not asking for this to be revised by the Supreme Court in Argentina or [by] The Hague.\"\n\n26.\n\nIn response, CMS observed that the *Ekmedjian* judgment was rendered prior to the 1994 revision of the Constitution under which all treaties other than human rights treaties are subordinate to the Constitution. It appreciated the declaration made by Argentina relating to the implementation of the Award, but added that it was \"not sufficient to outweigh the doubts that exist in the public record or to bind future leaders and Ministers in Argentina.\" It stressed that the stay of enforcement, if any, should not cover the option to purchase given to Argentina in paragraph 3 of the *dispositif* of the Award. The one-year period fixed in this article \"started to run with the dispatch of the Award, and it stopped running in September when the automatic provisional stay went into effect, and when the stay is lifted, the remaining eight months will run on the option.\"\n\n27.\n\nArgentina disagreed on that last point and contended that the decision taken by the Tribunal cannot be considered as separable. Pursuant to the stay, the whole Award had been suspended.\n\n28.\n\nOn 12 June 2006, in response to a request from the Committee, the Argentine Republic, under the signature of Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* provided \"an undertaking to CMS Gas Transmission Company that, in accordance with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in this proceeding as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories, in the event that annulment is not granted\" (Committee\u2019s translation).\n\n29.\n\nIn a letter dated 19 June 2006, CMS contended that Dr. Guglielmino\u2019s letter did not provide additional comfort, that it must be viewed in context and that it did not bind Argentina. For those reasons, it maintained its previous submissions.\n\n30.\n\nOn the invitation of the Committee, on 26 June 2006, Argentina submitted a copy of the decision rendered by its Supreme Court in *Ekmedjian v. Sofovich.*\n\n31.\n\nBy a letter dated 27 June 2006, Argentina expressed the view that the matters raised by CMS in its letter of 19 June 2006 did not require any further response. It did, however, provide a copy of the Argentine regulations relating to the power of the *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina.*\n\n32.\n\nBy a letter dated 30 June 2006, CMS made further comments on the last two letters of Argentina and submitted to the Committee the relevant passages of the Argentine Constitution.\n\n**C. The** ***ad hoc*** **Committee\u2019s views**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nArticle 52 (5) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request\".\n\n34.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules applicable in the present case provides:\n\n**\"Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\"\n\n35.\n\nOn a request under Rule 54(1), the Committee has a discretion which it should exercise, after both parties have had an opportunity to be heard, taking into account any relevant circumstances. The effect of the stay is that the award is not subject to enforcement proceedings under Article 54 of the Convention pending the outcome of the annulment application. Since a stay is not automatic, the Tribunal could grant the request subject to conditions, including a condition that an appropriate bond be provided.\n\n36.\n\nThe question whether a stay should be granted unconditionally or on condition of a bank guarantee has been discussed in a number of earlier proceedings (see also C. Schreuer, The ICSID *Convention. A Commentary* (Cambridge 2001), 1052-1060).\n\n*(a) In Amco Asia Corporation v Republic of Indonesia (First Annulment)3* the Committee granted a stay on condition of the furnishing of a bank guarantee *(**Amco Asia Corporation v Republic of Indonesia* - First Annulment - 1986 - 1 ICSID Reports 509, 513, para. 8; see Schreuer, 1956 for a brief account of the reasoning). A similar order was made in the second annulment proceeding between the same parties\u00a0*(Amco Asia Corporation v Republic of Indonesia* - Second Annulment - ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 - Annulment decision of 3 December 1992, 9 ICSID Reports 3, 22-23 (paras. 3.03, 3.07).\n\n*(b)* In *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v Republic of Guinea,* the Committee declined to impose the condition of a guarantee, on the basis that this would be costly and would place the Claimant \"in a much more favourable position that it enjoys at the present time\" (*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v Republic of Guinea,* Interim Order No. 1,12 August 1988, 4 ICSID Reports 111, 115, para. 22).\n\n*(c) In Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt,4* the Committee continued the stay of execution conditional on the provision of a guarantee in the amount of the award (*Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt,* Procedural Order No. 1, 5 April 2001, referred to in the final decision of the Committee, (2002) 6 ICSID Reports 129, 131, para. 6).\n\n*(d)* In *CDC Group PLC v Republic of the Seychelles5,* the Committee held that there was no evidence of \"catastrophic consequences\" to the Respondent which could follow the immediate enforcement of the award, and that as a matter of fairness to the Claimant the delay caused by the annulment proceeding should be addressed by the provision of security as a condition of a stay *(CDC Group PLC v Republic of the Seychelles* -\u00a0ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 - Decision of 14 July 2004, paras. 21-22).\n\n*(e)* In *Patrick Mitchell* v *Democratic Republic of the Congo6* the Committee, by majority, declined to make the stay conditional upon the posting of security on the basis that it was \"not convinced that the DRCQ, albeit its present political difficulties, will not comply in the future with its international obligations driving from the ICSID Convention\" (Patrick *Mitchell v Democratic Republic of the Congo -* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision of 30 November 2004, para. 42).\n\n*(f)* In *MTD* v *Chile,* the Committee concluded that \"Chile has demonstrated that MTD will not be prejudiced by the grant of a stay, other that in respect of the delay which is however incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which can be remedied by the payment of interest.\" On that basis, it granted a stay without making it conditional upon the provision of a guarantee (*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile S.A.* v *The Republic of Chile -* ICSID Case ARB/01/7, Decision of 1 June 2005).\n\n*(g)* In *Repsol YPF Ecuador* v *Petroecuador7* the Committee continued the stay of execution conditional on a guarantee in the amount of the award, plus the corresponding interest *(Repsol YPF Ecuador - Petroecuador -* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Decision of 22 December 2005).\n\nAmco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1)\n\nWena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4)\n\nCDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14).\n\nPatrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7)\n\nRepsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10)\n\n37.\n\nThe Committee agrees with earlier decisions to the effect that, unless there is some indication that the annulment application is brought without any basis under the Convention, i.e., that it is dilatory, it is not for the Committee to assess as a preliminary matter whether or not it is likely to succeed. In requesting annulment, an applicant avails itself of a right given by the Convention. There is no indication here that Argentina is acting in a merely dilatory manner. Thus the Committee does not need to form any view as to the likelihood of success of the application for annulment in the present case.\n\n38.\n\nAs a general matter a respondent State seeking annulment should be entitled to a stay provided it gives reasonable assurances that the award, if not annulled, will be complied with. It should not be exposed, while exercising procedural rights open to it under the Convention, to the risk that payment made under an award which is eventually annulled may turn to the irrecoverable from an insolvent claimant. At the same time a Respondent seeking a remedy under the Convention should demonstrate that for its part it will comply with the Convention, and if there is doubt in that regard the Committee may order the provision of a bank guarantee as a condition of a stay.\n\n39.\n\nIt is true the provision of a bank guarantee puts a claimant in a better position that it would be if annulment had not been sought, since it converts the undertaking of compliance under Article 53 of the Convention into a financial guarantee and avoids any issue of sovereign immunity from execution, which is expressly reserved by Article 55 of the Convention. On the other hand, a request for annulment causes significant delay to the claimant, with the consequent possibility of prejudice. Although this can be dealt with by an award of interest in the event that the annulment application fails, nonetheless there will have been a further delay in the award becoming enforceable and this is a factor entitled to some weight.\n\n40.\n\nDespite this, in the Committee\u2019s view the key feature of the situation is that, by the express terms of Article 54 of the Convention, an ICSID award is to be given the same effect as a final judgment of the courts of the Respondent State. As compared with other international arbitral arrangements, final awards under the ICSID Convention are directly enforceable, upon registration and without further jurisdictional control, as final judgments of the courts of the host State. It is true that immunity from execution is reserved (Article 55), but this simply leaves the issue of immunity to be dealt with under the applicable law: \u00abImmunity from execution of the host State in its own courts would depend entirely on its domestic law\" (Schreuer, op. cit. 1176).\n\n41.\n\nStates Parties to the Convention have an obligation to give effect to Article 54 of the Convention in their internal law. Exactly how this is done depends on the constitutional arrangements of the State Party concerned; the point for the Committee is to be satisfied that the State Party has taken appropriate steps in accordance with its constitutional arrangements to give effect to Article 54. Where it has done so, subsequent compliance by that State with a final award will be a matter of legal right under its own law, as well as under international law.\n\n42.\n\nArgentina states that under Article 75, paragraph 22 of its Constitution as amended in 1994: \"The Congress shall have the power... to approve or reject treaties entered into with other nations and with international organisations, and concordats with the Holy See, treaties and concordats have higher standing than laws\" (\"Los tratados y concordatos tienen jerarqu\u00eda superior a las leyes\"). Therefore, according to Argentina, under Argentine law, \"all international law is part of the law of the land, so all international treaties ratified by Argentina are automatically part of our law, without need for further incorporation\", and \"international obligations prevail over domestic statutes\". It is the case with respect to the ICSID Convention and, as a consequence, article 54 of that Convention has been given direct effect in Argentina law and will be applied as such by courts.\n\n43.\n\nArgentina adds that this has been confirmed by its Supreme Court in the *Ekmedjian v Sofovich* case (7 July 1992) in which the Court specified that \"The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties... accords the international law of treaties primacy over internal law. Such priority in rank is now part of the Argentine legal system... The necessary application of Article 27 of the Vienna Convention imposes on Argentine State agencies the duty to assign priority to the treaty in the event of conflict with any contrary internal rules.\"\n\n44.\n\nCMS points out that this does not exclude that any final ICSID award may be subject to internal review by the Supreme Court of Argentina as to its constitutionality. In this respect it stresses that the *Ekmedjian* v *Sofovich* decision was rendered before the revision of paragraph 22 of Article 75 of the Constitution. Today, this paragraph provides that the nine human rights instruments which it lists \"stand on the same level as the Constitution *(tienen jerarqu\u00eda constitutional),* do not repeal any article in the First Part of this Constitution and must be understood as complementary of the rights and guarantees recognized therein\". Paragraph 22 adds that \"Other Treaties and Convention on human rights after being approved by the Congress, shall require the vote of the two-thirds of the totality of the members of each chamber in order to have constitutional hierarchy *(para gozar de la jerarqu\u00eda constitutional).\"* Thus, in the opinion of CMS, \"the current hierarchy of laws in Argentina is: (i) Constitution and certain international human rights treaties; (ii) other international treaties; (iii) domestic laws.\"\n\n45.\n\nThe Committee notes that Argentina ratified the ICSID Convention on 18 November 1994. It is not disputed that, under the Argentine Constitution, the Convention is consequently part of Argentine domestic law. As a consequence, in the opinion of the Committee, it has not been shown that Argentina needed to take any further step to give effect to the Convention and in particular to its Article 54.\n\n46.\n\nNonetheless, the parties disagree on the place of the ICSID Convention in the hierarchy of law in Argentina and on the position in case of conflict between the Convention and the Constitution. The Committee does not have to take position on that question as such. However, it has to consider the arguments drawn by CMS from the fact that, on several occasions, Argentina officials have suggested that \"Any adverse ICSID award would be subject to a Supreme Court review.\" CMS contends that such statements cast serious doubt on Argentina\u2019s willingness to comply with Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. It submits that consequently a stay of execution should not be granted without a bank guarantee.\n\n47.\n\nThe Committee observes that, according to press reports, statements of that type have been made by former Ministers of Justice and Finance of Argentina. It also notes that Dr. Guglielmino, the Agent of Argentina in the present case, mentioned more recently the possibility of submitting the validity of ICSID awards to the International Court of Justice. However, during the hearings, the Argentine Agent declared that: \"In the case that the Committee confirms the award, we are not asking for this to be revised by the Supreme Court of Argentina or by [in] the Hague\". The Committee then requested a written statement on behalf of the Argentina Republic with respect to its compliance with the award under the ICSID Convention in the event that the Award is not annulled. In its letter dated 12 June 2006, signed by Dr. Guglielmino, \"the Republic of Argentina\" provided \"an undertaking to CMS Gas Transmission Company that, in accordance with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories, in the event that annulment is not granted.\"\n\n48.\n\nCMS recognizes that the *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n* has authority, under Argentine law, to represent the Government in arbitral proceedings. However, it submits that, under Article 99 of the Constitution, only the President, subject to prior approval by the Congress, has power to issue undertakings that bind Argentina internationally under Argentine law. It adds that the statements of the present *Procurador* could be disregarded by his successor in the same manner that he himself disregarded contrary statements made by his predecessor.\n\n49.\n\nThe Committee notes that Dr. Guglielmino, *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* is Agent of Argentina in the present case. In this capacity, he represents Argentina as provided for in Rule 18 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. He has authority to commit Argentina, as decided in many comparable cases by international courts and arbitral tribunals (see for instance *Joy Mining Machinery Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt -* ICSID Case No. ARB /03/11- Award on Jurisdiction - 6 August 2004 - paragraphs 95 to 98).8 Thus, in a recent case, the International Court of Justice did not grant provisional measures requested by Argentina, taking into account statements made by the Agent of Uruguay \"to comply in full with the 1975 Statute of the River Uruguay and its application\" *(Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay -* Order, 13 July 2006 - paragraph 83). To take the words of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the Committee \"can be in no doubt as to the binding character\" of the statement made by Dr. Guglielmino on behalf of Argentina. (PCIJ - case concerning certain *German interests in Upper Silesia -* merits - judgment N\u00b0 7 - Serie A - p. 13).\n\nJoy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11) - Award also available online at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/joy-mining-award.pdf\n\n50.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the letter of Dr. Guglielmino dated 12 June 2006 should dispel the doubts that CMS may legitimately have had in the past. This letter irrevocably commits Argentina to enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed upon it by the Award in the event that annulment is not granted. Having regard to this commitment, the Committee is of the opinion that Argentina had demonstrated that CMS will not be prejudiced by the grant of a stay, other that in respect of the delay which is, however, incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which can be remedied by the payment of interest in the event that the annulment application is unsuccessful. As a consequence, the Committee has decided to grant such a stay without requesting Argentina to provide a bank guarantee.\n\n51.\n\nHowever, the parties are in disagreement with respect to the extent of such a stay. Argentina submits that the stay must cover not only the pecuniary obligations specified in paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Award, but also the provisions of paragraph 3 under which:\n\n\"Upon payment of the compensation decided in this Award, the Claimant shall transfer to the Respondent the ownership of its shares in TGN upon payment by the Respondent of the additional sum of US $ 2,148,100. The Respondent shall have up to one year after the date this Award is dispatched to the parties to accept such transfer.\"\n\nCMS, by contrast, submits that the option to purchase offered by paragraph 3 must not be left open-ended, even if stay of enforcement continues,\n\n52.\n\nThe Committee observes that the transfer contemplated by paragraph 3 of the Award was to take place \"upon payment of the compensation decided\" and within one year of dispatch of the Award. Since the payment of compensation has been and will remain stayed, the condition precedent to the transfer of shares in TGM cannot be met for the time being. Therefore the one-ycar limit set forth in the Award is likewise stayed.\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee, unanimously:\n\nContinues in force the stay in the enforcement of the award pending its decision on the application for annulment"}, {"Title": "Decision of the Ad hoc Committee on Argentina's Application for Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2007-09-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the Ad hoc Committee on Argentina's Application for Annulment\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 September 2005, the Argentine Republic (Argentina) filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) an application in writing, requesting the annulment of an Award dated 12 May 2005 rendered by the Tribunal in the arbitration between CMS Gas Transmission Company (CMS) and the Argentine Republic.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ICSID Convention). In it, Argentina sought annulment of the Award on two of the five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically that the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers and that it failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n3.\n\nThe Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the Arbitration Rules), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment was decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Secretary-General registered the Application on 27 September 2005 and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were notified that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 30 September 2005, the Claimant made a request under Arbitration Rule 54(2) for the stay of enforcement of the Award to be lifted unless Argentina provided adequate assurances as to the payment of the Award should the application for annulment fail.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 18 April 2006, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee (the Committee) had been constituted, composed of Judge Gilbert Guillaume, of French nationality, Judge Nabil Elaraby, of Egyptian nationality, and Professor James Crawford, of Australian nationality. The parties were also informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 20 April 2006, the parties were notified that Judge Gilbert Guillaume had been designated President of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 2 May 2006, the Centre sent to the parties copies of the declarations signed by each Member of the Committee pursuant to Arbitration Rule 52(2).\n\n9.\n\nThe parties disagreed on the effects of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award over Argentina\u2019s option to purchase CMS\u2019s shares in Transportadora de Gas del Norte (TGN), as provided for in sub-paragraph 3 of the *dispositif* of the Award.\n\n10.\n\nAfter due deliberation, the Committee decided that, since the payment of compensation has been stayed, the condition precedent to the transfer of shares in TGN for the time being could not be met and thus the time limit set forth in the Award for such transfer must be considered as likewise provisionally stayed. The decision of the Committee was notified to the parties by the Secretariat on 10 May 2006.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 16 May 2006, the Argentine Republic requested that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award be continued until the Committee had the opportunity to hear both parties on the matter. By letter of that same date, the Claimant reiterated its request that the stay be discontinued unless adequate assurances were provided by the Argentine Republic that it would comply with the Award in the event its annulment application was rejected.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 17 May 2006, the Committee informed the parties of its decision to continue the stay of the Award until 5 June 2006 (the date previously fixed for the first session of the Committee with the parties).\n\n13.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, as scheduled, with the agreement of the parties, on 5 June 2006, at the premises of the World Bank in Paris, France, and several issues of procedure were agreed and decided. During the session, both parties addressed the Committee on the question of the continuance of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nAfter having heard the parties\u2019 arguments, the Committee requested a written statement on behalf of the Argentine Republic, to be filed within seven days, with respect to its compliance with the Award under the ICSID Convention if the Award were not annulled. It further decided that it would be open to CMS to comment within the further seven days on such statement. At the same time, it decided to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award until it had taken a decision.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the Committee\u2019s directions, the Argentine Republic submitted on 12 June 2006, a written statement signed by Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmlno, Argentina\u2019s Attorney-General, in which it stated that:\n\n\"The Republic of Argentina hereby provides an undertaking to CMS Gas Transmission Company that, in accordance with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in this proceeding as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories, in the event annulment is not granted.\"\n\n16.\n\nIn a letter dated 19 June 2006, CMS contended that Dr. Guglielmlno\u2019s letter did not provide additional comfort, that it must be viewed in context and that it did not bind Argentina.\n\n17.\n\nOn the invitation of the Committee, on 26 June 2006 Argentina submitted a copy of the decision rendered by its Supreme Court in *Ekmedji\u00e1n v. Sofovich.1*\n\nArgentina, Supreme Court, *Ekmekdjian, Miguel Angel v. Sofovich, Gerardo y otros,* Fallos: 315:1492 (7 July 1992).\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 27 June 2006, Argentina expressed the view that the matters raised by CMS in its letter of 19 June 2006 did not require any further response. It did, however, provide a copy of the Argentine regulations relating to the power of the *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina.*\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 30 June 2006, CMS made further comments and submitted to the Committee relevant passages of the Argentine Constitution.\n\n20.\n\nAfter considering the parties\u2019 written and oral arguments on the matter and due deliberation, the Committee issued on 1 September 2006 its *Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award.*\n\n21.\n\nIn its Decision, the Committee ordered that the stay of execution be continued pending its decision on Argentina\u2019s application for annulment without the need for Argentina to provide a bank guarantee. In the Committee\u2019s view, Argentina had demonstrated that CMS would not be prejudiced by the grant of a stay, other than in respect of the delay which is, however, incidental to the Convention system of annulment and which could be remedied by the payment of interest in the event the annulment application was unsuccessful.\n\n22.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable set forth by the Committee during the 5 June 2006 session, Argentina filed its Memorial on Annulment on 13 September 2006.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 15 September 2006, the law firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP informed the Committee that it would no longer represent the Argentine Republic in this proceeding.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 22 September 2006, CMS claimed that 48 of the 60 legal and factual authorities referred to in Argentina\u2019s Memorial were missing. By letter dated 29 September 2006, the Argentine Republic responded, stating that the authorities referred to in CMS\u2019 letter were in the public domain and easily available to the Claimant. The Argentine Republic noted that it did enclose with its Memorial the Argentine legal authorities cited, which would not be of easy access to non-Argentine lawyers.\n\n25.\n\nThrough letter from the Secretary of the Committee dated 12 October 2006, the Committee, noting that, in fact, the documents in question were publicly available, invited CMS to indicate, by 13 October 2006, which of the legal authorities Argentina referred to in its Memorial it would need to receive, and instructed Argentina to provide copies of such documents to counsel for CMS in Buenos Aires, by 18 October 2006. By letter dated 13 October 2006, counsel for CMS informed the Committee that they had been able to collect all of the legal authorities referred to in Argentina\u2019s Memorial.\n\n26.\n\nOn 21 December 2006, CMS filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment; the Argentine Republic filed its Reply on 22 January 2007, and CMS filed its Rejoinder on 22 February 2007.\n\n27.\n\nAfter consultation with the parties, the President of the Committee held a preliminary organizational telephone conference call with counsel for both parties on 19 March 2007. The conference call was attended by Ms. Lucy Reed, Mr. Nigel Blackaby and Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil, on behalf of CMS and by Dr. Gabriel Bottini, on behalf of the Argentine Republic. During the conference call the parties agreed on the manner in which the hearing on annulment would be conducted. These agreements were reflected in a letter from the Secretary of the Committee to the parties dated 20 March 2007.\n\n28.\n\nAs agreed, a 2-day hearing was held at the World Bank offices in Paris on 27-28 March 2007, at which counsel for both parties presented their arguments and submissions, and responded to questions from the Members of the Committee. Present at the hearing were the Members of the Annulment Committee: Judge Gilbert Guillaume, Judge Nabil Elaraby and Professor James Crawford; the Secretary of the Committee: Mr. Gonzalo Flores; CMS\u2019 representatives: Ms. Lucy Reed, Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Dr. Lluis Paradell, Mr. Reza Mohtashami and Ms. Daina Bray of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP; Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil and Dr. Ignacio Minorini Lima of M. & M. Bomchil and Ms. Sharon Mcllnay and Mr. Thomas Miller of CMS Gas Transmission Company; and representatives of the Argentine Republic: Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmlno, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Dr. Gabriel Bottini, Dr. Ignacio Torterola, Dr. Jorge Barraguirre, Dr. Ignacio Perez Cort\u00e9s, Dr. Diego Gosis, Dr. Ver\u00f3nica Lavista and Dr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Zurrro, from Argentina\u2019s Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n and Professor Philippe Sands, QC and Ms. Alison MacDonald of Matrix Chambers.\n\n29.\n\nThe President of the Committee declared the proceeding closed on September 21, 2007. During the course of the proceedings, the Members of the Committee deliberated by various means of communication, including meetings in Paris on 15 May and 3 July 2007, and have taken into account all pleadings, documents and testimony before them.\n\n**B. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n30.\n\nIn order to put an end to the economic crisis of the late 1980s, Argentina adopted in 1989 an economic recovery plan which included a privatization program of government-owned industries and public utilities. For that purpose, it enacted Reform of State Law N\u00b0 23,696 of August 1989, Currency Convertibility Law N\u00b0 23,928 of March 1991 and Decree N\u00b0 2,128/91 pegging the Argentine currency to the United States dollar.\n\n31.\n\nWithin this framework, Gas Law N\u00b0 24,076 of May 1992, implemented by various decrees, established the legal framework for the privatization of the gas industry and regulated the transport and distribution of natural gas. The Law established a new regulatory regime with ENARGAS, the public regulatory agency of the gas industry, supervising the proper functioning of the industry, and in particular determining the tariffs charged by the transporters to the distributors.\n\n32.\n\nGas del Estado, a national State-owned monopoly, was thus divided into two transportation companies and eight distributor companies to be privatized. Transportadora de Gas del Norte was one of the companies established as a result of this restructuring. In December 1992, TGN was granted a license to transport gas in Argentina through the operation of the North and Central West pipelines in conformity with Decree 2,255/92.\n\n33.\n\nAt the same time, Argentina sold 70% in TGN to a consortium of investors. It placed 5% in an Employee share program and retained 25%. This 25% was purchased in 1995 by CMS Gas Argentina, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS Gas Transmission Company. In 1999, CMS Gas Argentina purchased from third parties a further 4.42% share in TGN.\n\n34.\n\nAs recalled by the Tribunal,2 in CMS\u2019s view, under the regime established by those laws and decrees and by the license granted to TGN, tariffs were to be calculated in dollars, conversion to pesos to be effected at the time of billing and tariffs adjusted every six months in accordance with the United States Producer Price Index (US-PPI). As noted again by the Tribunal, Argentina had a different understanding of the nature and legal effects of those various instruments.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina* (2005) 44 *1LM* 1 205, 1211 (para. 57) (\"Award\").\n\n35.\n\nTowards the end of the 1990s a serious economic crisis began to unfold in Argentina. The representatives of the gas companies agreed twice, subject to certain conditions, in January 2000 and July 2000, to defer the US PII adjustment of the gas tariffs. However an Argentine court issued in August 2000 an injunction for the suspension of the second agreement and on several occasions ENARGAS later confirmed the continuing freeze of the US-PPI adjustment.\n\n36.\n\nIn late 2001, the crisis deepened and, on 6 January 2002, Law N\u00b0 25,561 declared a public emergency. Under that Law the right of licensees of public utilities to adjust tariffs according to the US PPI was terminated, as well as the calculation of tariffs in dollars. The tariffs were redenominated in pesos at the rate of one peso to one dollar.3\n\nFrom March 2002 onwards the official exchange rate for the peso was in the region of 3-3.85 per US$1, a devaluation of more than 60%.\n\n37.\n\nIn July 2001, ICSID had already received from CMS a request for arbitration relating mainly to the decisions taken in August 2000 concerning the application of the PPI to tariffs of the gas industry. The arbitral tribunal was duly constituted in January 2002. In its memorial of July 2002, CMS extended its claim to cover the measures taken later by Argentina, and in particular those adopted in January 2002.\n\n38.\n\nBy decision taken on 17 July 2003, the Tribunal decided that the whole dispute was \"within the jurisdiction of the Center and the competence of the Tribunal\"4 Then, in an Award of 12 May 2005, the Tribunal rejected CMS\u2019 claims of expropriation under Article IV and of discriminatory and arbitrary treatment under Article II(2)(b) of the Argentina-US Bilateral Investment Treaty (the BIT).5 On the other hand it ruled that Argentina had \"breached its obligations to accord the investor the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty and to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty\".6 It did not accept Argentina\u2019s \"defenses\" based on necessity and article XI of the BIT. It awarded CMS compensation of US$133.2 million.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina (Jurisdiction)* (2003) 7 ICSID Reports 494, 521-522 (para. 131) (\"Jurisdictional Decision\").\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, 14 November 1991 (in force 20 October 1994).\n\nAward, sub-para. 1 of the *dispositif.*\n\n39.\n\nIn sub-paragraphs 3 and 4 of its *dispositif* the Tribunal added:\n\n\"3. Upon payment of the compensation decided in this Award, the Claimant shall transfer to the Respondent the ownership of its shares in TGN upon payment by the Respondent of the additional sum of US$2,148,100. The Respondent shall have up to one year after the date this Award is dispatched to the parties to accept such transfer.\n\n4. The respondent shall pay the Claimant simple interest at the annualized average rate of 2.51% of the United States Treasury Bills for the period August 18, 2000 to 60 days after the date of this Award, or the date of the effective payment if before, applicable to both the value loss suffered by the Claimant and the residual value of its shares established in 2 and 3 above. However, the interest on the residual value of the shares shall cease to run upon written notice by Argentina to the Claimant that it will not exercise its option to buy the Claimant\u2019s shares in TGN. After the date indicated above, the rate shall be the arithmetic average of the six-month US Treasury Bills rates observed on the afore-mentioned date and every six months thereafter, compounded semi-annually\".\n\nThe Tribunal specified that \"[e]ach party shall pay one half of the arbitration costs and bear its own legal costs.\"7 It dismissed all other claims.\n\nIbid., sub-para. 5 of the *dispositif.*\n\n40.\n\nArgentina asks the Committee to annul this Award.\n\n**C. The Grounds for Annulment**\n--------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nBefore entering into the examination of the case, the Committee will first recall the basis on which it must deal with the submissions of Argentina. Under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, each Party may request annulment of an award on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n\"(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"\n\n42.\n\nIn the present case, Argentina identifies a large number of perceived defects in the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional findings, in its findings relating to Articles II(2)(a), II(2)(c) and XI of the BIT and to necessity under customary international law, as well as in the calculation of the damages. It submits that the Award must be annulled because, on many of those grounds, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(b)) or failed to state the reasons on which it based its decisions (Article 52(e)).\n\n43.\n\nBoth parties recognize that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal and that its competence extends only to annulment based on one or other of the grounds expressly set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. That basic proposition was specified, for example, by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina8* and has been confirmed by other *ad hoc* committees.9 Argentina, however, submits that \"the present case was the first award in the large group of ICSID arbitrations currently pending against Argentina\".10 It stresses the importance of the problems raised by those arbitrations. It concludes that \"the extraordinary implications of the Tribunal\u2019s decision mandate close scrutiny of its reasoning by the Annulment Committee.\"11\n\n*CAA & Vivendi Universal v.

As stated in *MTD v. Chile (Annulment),* a committee\n\n\"cannot substitute its determination on the merits for that of the Tribunal. Nor can it direct a Tribunal on a resubmission how it should resolve substantive issues in dispute. All it can do is annul the decision of the tribunal: it can extinguish a *res judicata* but on a question of merits it cannot create a new one. A more interventionist approach by committees on the merits of disputes would risk a renewed cycle of tribunal and annulment proceedings of the kind observed in *Klockner and AMCO.\"12*\n\n*MTD v. Chile,* para. 54.\n\n45.\n\nAs Argentine noted, the present arbitration was the first of a long series relating to the Argentine crisis of 2001-2002. Accordingly the Committee will seek to clarify certain points of substance on which, in its view, the Tribunal made manifest errors of law. It remains to be seen, however, whether as a consequence the award should be annulled.\n\n**(a) Manifest excess of powers**\n---------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn the present case, Argentina first submits that the Tribunal \"manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising jurisdiction over claims by a company\u2019s shareholder for income lost by the company.\"13 It also contends that it did so \"by authorizing CMS, which was not a party to any of the applicable instruments, to claim a breach of obligations\" under Article II(2)(c) of the treaty, the so-called \"umbrella clause\".14\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, p. 25.\n\nIbid., p. 34.\n\n47.\n\nAs the *ad hoc* Committee in *Klockner I* said:\n\n\"Clearly, an arbitral tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction, whether said to be partial or total, necessarily comes within the scope of an \"excess of powers\" under Article 52 (l)(b).\"15\n\n*Klockner,* para. 4.\n\n48.\n\nArgentina further submits that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in transforming the \"fair and equitable\" and \"umbrella\" clauses of the BIT into strict liability provisions. According to Argentina, it did so also \"by failing to give effect to Treaty Article XI\".16 Moreover Argentina contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in rejecting Argentina\u2019s defense of necessity under customary international law.17 More generally it submits that the Tribunal failed to apply the governing law.18\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, p. 52.\n\nIbid., paras. 170-180.\n\nIbid., paras. 181-205.\n\n49.\n\nIt is well established that the ground of manifest excess of powers is not limited to jurisdictional error. A complete failure to apply the law to which a Tribunal is directed by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention can also constitute a manifest excess of powers\n\n50.\n\nHowever *ad hoc* Committees have sought to distinguish between failure to apply the law and error in its application. For instance the Committee in the *MINE* case stated that:\n\n\"[A] tribunal\u2019s disregard of the agreed rules of law would constitute a derogation from the terms of reference within which the tribunal has been authorized to function. Examples of such a derogation include the application of rules of law other that the ones agreed by the parties, or a decision not based on any law unless the parties had agreed on a decision *ex aequo et bono.* If the derogation is manifest, it entails a manifest excess of power.\n\nDisregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment.\"19\n\n*MINE,* paras. 5.03-5.04.\n\n51.\n\nAs the Committee *va MTD v. Chile (Annulment)* said:\n\n\"An award will not escape annulment if the tribunal, while purporting to apply the relevant law actually applies another, quite different law. But in such a case the error must be \u2018manifest\u2019, not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rule is not enough.\"20\n\n*MTD Chile,* para. 47.\n\n52.\n\nWhen considering the submissions of Argentina concerning the Tribunal\u2019s findings under Articles II(2)(a), II(2)(c) and XI of the BIT and under customary international law, the Committee will keep those distinctions in mind.\n\n**(b) Failure to state reasons**\n--------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal in its decision on jurisdiction and in its finding relating to the BIT and customary international law of necessity as well as in its calculation of damages, failed to state the reasons on which the award is based, contrary to Article 52 (e) of the ICSID Convention.21\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, paras. 166-171, 206-223.\n\n54.\n\nCommittees have frequently applied this provision. The Committee in the *Vivendi* case stated in this respect:\n\n\"[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(l)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.... Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article (52)(l)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\"22\n\n*Vivendi,* paras. 64-65.\n\n55.\n\nCommittees in other annulment cases have expressed similar views. Thus the Committee in the *MINE* case stated that:\n\n\"[T]he requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. The minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"23\n\n\"[T]he requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph 1(e)...\"24\n\n*MINE,* para. 5.09.\n\nIbid., para. 5.08.\n\n56.\n\nIn *Wena Hotels,* the Committee added:\n\n\"Neither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(l)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal\u2019s reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The tribunal\u2019s reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.\"25\n\n\"It is in the nature of this ground of annulment that in case the award suffers from a lack of reasons which can be challenged within the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e), the remedy need not be the annulment of the award. The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on its merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal\u2019s decision. If the award does not meet the minimal requirement as to the reasons given by the Tribunal, it does not necessarily need to be resubmitted to a new Tribunal. If the *ad hoc* committee so concludes, on the basis of the knowledge it has received upon the dispute, the reasons supporting the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions can be explained by the *ad hoc* Committee itself.\"26\n\n*Wena Hotels,* para. 81.\n\nIbid., para. 83.\n\n57.\n\nThe Committee agrees, and will consider Argentina\u2019s submission based on Article 52(l)(e) on this basis.\n\n**D. CMS\u2019s** ***Jus Standi***\n-----------------------------\n\n**(a) The Award**\n-----------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal analyzed the objections by Argentina to CMS\u2019s *jus standi* in observing in its decision on jurisdiction that those objections raised two issues: \"First... whether a shareholder can claim for its rights in a foreign company independently from the latter\u2019s rights and, if so, whether these rights refer only to its status as shareholder or also to substantive rights connected with the legal and economic performance of its investment. Second... whether the Claimant satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of the Convention and the BIT\",27 particularly whether the alleged dispute \"arises directly from the investment\".28\n\nJurisdictional Decision, 502 (para. 41).\n\nIbid.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal examined the first question under Argentine legislation, general international law, the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-United States BIT.29 It concluded that Argentine legislation was not relevant in this respect.30 It found \"no bar in current international law to the concept of allowing claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned\"31 It arrived at the same conclusion with respect to the ICSID Convention.32 Finally it decided that CMS had a \"direct right of action\" as shareholder under the BIT.33\n\nIbid., 502-508 (paras. 42-65).\n\nIbid., 502 (para. 42).\n\nIbid., 504 (para. 48).\n\nIbid., 506 (para. 56).\n\nIbid., 508 (para. 65).\n\n60.\n\nPassing to the second point, the Tribunal reaffirmed that \"the rights of the Claimant can be asserted independently from the rights of TGN and those relating to the License...\"34 It added that \"the Claimant has a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the protected investment...\"35 It concluded that the dispute arose directly from the investment.36\n\nIbid., 508 (para. 68).\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n61.\n\nOn both grounds the Tribunal decided that CMS had *jus standi.*\n\n**(b) The Parties\u2019 submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nArgentina submits that \"the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the case because CMS was claiming compensation for alleged breaches of rights belonging not to it, but to TGN.\"37 In its view \"the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising jurisdiction over claims by a company\u2019s shareholder for income lost by the company.\"38\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, para. 68.\n\nIbid., 25.\n\n63.\n\nIn this respect Argentina first contends that the Tribunal \"erroneously affirmed the non-applicability of Argentine law in the jurisdictional phase.\"39 It notes that the Tribunal \"nevertheless went on to refer to that law in its process of decision.\"40 It adds that in doing so, the Tribunal failed to apply the relevant provisions of Argentine law which specify the rights of shareholders.41\n\nIbid., para. 77.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n64.\n\nCriticizing the conclusions of the Tribunal under general international law, Argentina submits that\n\n\"in its process of decision, the Tribunal was trying to determine whether shareholders have a direct right of action, when it should have considered (and never did) whether CMS was *invoking it own rights in the proceedings.* In order to determine the latter, it is obviously material whether the investor is a party to a concession agreement or a license agreement with the host State. The Tribunal had limited jurisdiction over that part of the investment dispute that concerned CMS\u2019 rights as shareholder; it did not have jurisdiction over any part of any investment dispute concerning the rights of the party to the concession agreement or License.\"42\n\nIbid., para. 82 (emphasis in the original).\n\n65.\n\nPassing to the issue of *jus standi* under the ICSID Convention, Argentine underlines that, before the Tribunal, \"CMS was concerned not with its rights as shareholder, but with the alleged \u2018dismantling\u2019 of a tariff regime that granted rights to TGN, not to CMS.\"43 According to Argentina, this was an \"indirect claim\" which clearly falls outside ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction as attested by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention44\n\nIbid., para. 86.\n\nIbid., paras. 86-93.\n\n66.\n\nArgentina concludes that the Tribunal did not have the power to go beyond the \"outer limits\" of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, even if the 1991 BIT authorized it to do so (which Argentina does not accept).45 \"If the Tribunal had followed the applicable rules of treaty interpretation, as reflected in the 1969 VCLT, it would have avoided the manifest excess into which it fell.\"46\n\nIbid., para. 92.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, para. 92, citing Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, 1155 CATO 331.\n\n67.\n\nCMS submits that, \"[a]s the Tribunal correctly determined, national law is not \u2018determinant\u2019 in establishing the *jus standi* of CMS in the present case.\"47 It adds that the Tribunal\u2019s holding with respect to Argentine law is *obiter dicta.* It affirms that \"no part of CMS\u2019s dispute concerned TGN\u2019s contract rights as such. Conversely, all aspects of the dispute concerned CMS\u2019s own rights as a protected investor\" under the BIT and \"as a betrayed investor in Argentina\u2019s gas privatization.\"48 It states that \"investment treaty case law overwhelmingly recognizes the right of action of shareholders to complain of acts prejudicial to their shareholding that may be directed at the company in which the shares are held.\"49 It adds that article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention has \"no impact upon the autonomous right of a shareholder in a company incorporated in the host State to pursue its own BIT claim independently from the local company.\"50 Thus the Tribunal correctly analyzed the claim and rightly decided that it had jurisdiction on all aspects of the dispute.\n\nCMS\u2019 Annulment Counter-Memorial, para. 25.\n\nIbid., para 31.\n\nCMS\u2019 Annulment Rejoinder, para. 21.\n\nIbid., para. 28.\n\n**(c) The Committee\u2019s view**\n----------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Committee first recalls that the jurisdiction of the Centre is determined not by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention but by Article 25. The competence of the Tribunal is governed by the terms of the instruments expressing the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration, *i.e.* in the present case the Argentina-United States BIT. In consequence, as the Tribunal correctly decided, \"the applicable jurisdictional provisions are only those of the Convention and the BIT, not those which might arise from national legislation.\"51 Argentine law is irrelevant in this respect, as recognized in the Award and in many other ICSID decisions.52 The observations which were made in passing by the Tribunal on the piercing of the corporate veil in Argentine law53 are thus *obiter dicta.*\n\nJurisdictional Decision, 502 (para. 42).\n\nSee e.g. *Azurix Corporation v. Argentine Republic* (2003) 43 *ILM* 262, 276 (para. 72) (\"*Azurix\")',* *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic* (2004) 44 *ILM* 138, 161-162 (para. 141); *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 February 2006, para. 82 (\"*Continental Casualty\").*\n\nJurisdictional Decision, 502 (para. 42).\n\n69.\n\nWith respect to general international law, the Committee notes that the parties advanced different interpretations of the judgments rendered by the International Court of Justice in the *Barcelona Traction* case54 and the *ELSI* case.55 Those cases were concerned with diplomatic protection under customary international law and not with the protection of the rights of investors under treaties relating to the protection of investments.56 As specified by the Tribunal, those judgments are not \"directly relevant to the present dispute\".57 Moreover, as noted in the Jurisdictional Decision of 17 July 2003, nothing in general international law prohibits the conclusion of treaties allowing \"claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned... even if those shareholders are minority or non-controlling shareholders.\"58 Such treaties and in particular the ICSID Convention must be applied as *lex specialis59*\n\n*Case concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain),* ICJ Reports 1970, p. 3.\n\n*Case concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.a. (United States of America v. Italy),* ICJ Reports 1989, p. 15.\n\nThis distinction was clearly recognised by the International Court in *Case concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo) (Preliminary Objections),* Judgment of 24 May 2007, paras. 87-88.\n\nJurisdictional Decision, 503 (para. 44).\n\nIbid., 504 (para. 48).\n\nIbid.\n\n70.\n\nUnder Article 25(1) of that Convention:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\n71.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention did not attempt to define \"investment.\" Instead this task was left largely to the terms of bilateral investment treaties or other instruments on which jurisdiction is based. In the present case, this definition is provided for by Article 1(1) of the Argentina-United States BIT which states:\n\n\"(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n(ii) A company or shares of stocks or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof.\"\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee notes that this definition of \"investment\" is very broad, as already observed by various ICSID Tribunals in comparable cases.60 Such a definition remains however compatible with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee e.g. *AES Corporation v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 26 April 2005, para. 88; *Azurix,* para. 73; *Enron Corporation v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 44 *(\"Enron\")* ; *Sempra Energy International v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 May 2005, para. 93 *(\"Sempra Energy\").*\n\n73.\n\nThe Committee observes in particular that, as regard shareholder equity, the BIT contains nothing which indicates that the investor in capital stock has to have a majority of the stock or control over the administration of the company. Investments made by minority shareholders are covered by the actual language of the definition, as also recognized by ICSID arbitral tribunals in comparable cases.61\n\nSee e.g. *Camuzzi International S.A. v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 May 2005, para. 81; *Enron,* para. 44; *LG&E v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, para. 78; *Sempra Energy,* para. 93.\n\n74.\n\nOne must add that whether the locally incorporated company may itself claim for the violation of its rights under contracts, licenses or other instruments, in particular under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, does not affect the right of action of foreign shareholders under the BIT in order to protect their own interests in a qualifying investment, as recognized again in many ICSID awards.62\n\nSee *e.g.* *Continental Casualty,* para. 86; *Enron,* para. 49.\n\n75.\n\nThus in the present case, and as decided by the Tribunal, CMS must be considered an investor within the meaning of the BIT. It made a capital investment in TGN covered by the BIT. It asserted causes of action under the BIT in connection with that protected investment. Its claims for violation of its rights under the BIT were accordingly within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. This is without prejudice to the determination of the *extent* of those rights, a question to which the Committee will return.\n\n76.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee concludes that there is no manifest excess of powers in this respect.\n\n**E. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Award**\n-----------------\n\n77.\n\nCMS asserted before the Tribunal that Argentina had breached the provisions of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT according fair and equitable treatment to investments covered by the Treaty. The Tribunal stated that \"a stable legal and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment\"63 and observed that \"[t]he measures that are complained of did in fact entirely transform and alter the legal and business environment under which the investment was decided and made.\"64 It concluded that those measures \"resulted in the objective breach of the standard laid down in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty.\"65\n\nAward, para. 274.\n\nIbid., para. 275.\n\nIbid., para. 281.\n\n**(b) The Parties\u2019 submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nArgentina first submits that the Tribunal failed to determine the scope of international and domestic law as it applied to the dispute. It disregarded the Argentine law theory of \"*impr\u00e9vision\"* and the Argentine doctrine *ol \"contract revision\"66* Instead, it relied on a single French judgment, the decision of the Conseil d\u2019Etat in *Gaz de Bordeaux67* It thus failed to carry out any proper analysis of the situation in Argentine law.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, paras. 189-200.\n\nConseil d\u2019Etat, *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019Eclairage de Bordeaux,* Rec. 125, 30 March 1916\n\n79.\n\nArgentina adds that \"the Tribunal failed to interpret the 1991 Treaty and proceeded to give an award based on an unreasoned and unexplained assumption that investors have an enforceable legitimate expectation of total stability in the economy of the host State, irrespective of the circumstances.\"68 It \"took no account of Argentina\u2019s legitimate right to regulate by way of general measures adopted in the public interest...\"69 It did not \"evaluate the propriety of the challenged measures in the light of the dire emergency facing Argentina...\"70 It held, \"essentially, that investors have an enforceable legitimate expectation of total stability in the economy of the host State irrespective of the circumstances.\"71 It applied Article II(2)(a) in a mechanical manner and transformed that Article into a strict liability clause.72 It did not give reasons for such a decision and it also manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Reply, para. 43.\n\nIbid., para. 44.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, para. 117.\n\nIbid., para. 123.\n\nIbid., paras. 123-124.\n\n80.\n\nCMS contends that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in holding that Argentina had violated Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty. It submits that \"Argentina\u2019s challenge is nothing more than a repeat of its defense at first instance and an appeal of the Tribunal\u2019s finding on the merits.\" It submits that the Award applied Argentine law as appropriate. In its application of the BIT, the Tribunal did not ignore the \"context\" and did not \"apply the fair and equitable treatment standard in a vacuum\".73 \"Far from equating fair and equitable treatment with strict liability, the Tribunal recognized that a \u2018rebalancing\u2019 between Argentina and CMS was required due to the changing economic circumstances and that no such rebalancing had taken place - to the detriment of CMS.\"74 CMS adds that the Tribunal provided adequate reasons for its holding on this point.\n\nCMS\u2019 Annulment Counter-Memorial, para. 52.\n\nIbid., para. 59.\n\n**(c) The Committee\u2019s view**\n----------------------------\n\n81.\n\nArticle II(2)(a) of the BIT provides: \"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\"\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal observed that this Treaty \"like most bilateral investment treaties, does not define the standard of fair and equitable treatment...\"75 In the light of the Preamble to the Treaty, the Tribunal stated that \"a stable legal and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.\"76 It added that this standard \"is inseparable from stability and predictability\"77 According to the Tribunal, the legal framework existing at the time of the investment does not need to be frozen, \"as it can always evolve and be adapted to changing circumstances\", but it cannot be \"dispensed with altogether when specific commitments to the contrary have been made\"78\n\nAward, para. 273.\n\nIbid., para. 274.\n\nIbid., para. 276.\n\nIbid., para. 277.\n\n83.\n\nPassing to the dispute, the Tribunal referred to its previous findings about the tariff regime. It analyzed the general principles of Argentine law applicable in this respect, mentioning the *Gaz de Bordeaux* decision as a landmark decision which was at the origin of the theory of *\"impr\u00e9vision\"79* It added however that it did not need to look into general principles of law to find an answer as to how the contract in this case could have been adjusted to new economic realities.80 It observed that the pertinent mechanisms were embodied in the Law and the License itself and that those mechanisms had not been used.\n\nIbid., paras. 200-227.\n\nIbid., para. 228.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that \"[t]he measures that are complained of did in fact entirely transform and alter the legal and business environment under which the investment was decided and made.\"81 It added that \"the guarantees given in this connection under the legal framework and its various components were crucial for the investment decision.\"82 It concluded that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT had been breached.\n\nIbid., para. 275.\n\nIbid.\n\n85.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, this part of the Award is adequately founded on the applicable law and the relevant facts. The Tribunal proceeded to a detailed analysis of the rights of the Claimant,83 of the \"reality of the Argentine economy\" at the time of the crisis, of the measures then taken and of their consequences,84 before concluding that the fair and equitable standard had been violated.85 Contrary to what Argentina contends, the Tribunal evaluated the legality of the challenged measures in the light of all the circumstances of the case and did not transform Article II(2)(a) into a strict liability clause. The Committee has no jurisdiction to control the interpretation thus given by the Tribunal to that Article,86 still less to reconsider its evaluation of the facts. It is sufficient for the Committee to hold that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers.\n\nIbid., paras. 127-151.\n\nIbid., paras. 53-67, 152-166.\n\nIbid., para. 281.\n\nThe Committee would only note that the fair and equitable standard has been invoked in a great number of cases brought to ICSID arbitration and that there is some variation in the practice of arbitral tribunals in this respect. See Christoph Schreuer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice\" (2005) 6 *Journal of World Investment and Trade* 357.\n\n**F. The Umbrella Clause**\n--------------------------\n\n**(a) The Award**\n-----------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal first recalled that according to CMS, the BIT had been breached by Argentina under Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty, which provides that each party \"shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\" (the so called \"umbrella clause\").87 The Tribunal stated that it \"will not discuss the jurisdictional aspects involved in the Respondent\u2019s argument, as these were dealt with in the decision on jurisdiction.\"88 It went on to decide that \"the obligation under the umbrella clause of Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty had not been observed by the Respondent to the extent that legal and contractual obligations pertinent to the investment have been breached and have resulted in the violation of the standards of protection under the Treaty.\"89\n\nAward, para. 296.\n\nIbid., para. 299.\n\nIbid., para. 303.\n\n**(b) The Parties\u2019 submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nArgentina submits that neither the Republic of Argentina, nor any of its instrumentalities, assumed any obligation to CMS, apart from the provisions of the 1991 Treaty itself.90 Therefore CMS could invoke no obligation under Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty. It stresses that nonetheless the Tribunal authorized CMS to claim for a breach of obligations under the umbrella clause in a manifest excess of powers and without giving any reason.91\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, para. 96.\n\nIbid., para. 97.\n\n88.\n\nCMS submits that it did not claim for breach of TGN\u2019s tariffs rights as such, but for breach of the assurances given it as regards the tariff regime resulting from \"the legal instruments relating to the gas privatization, including the License\" issued to TGN.92 Those assurances \"constituted undertakings that Argentina was bound to observe under the Umbrella Clause.\"93 In the light of findings made in other parts of the award, the Tribunal rightly decided that Argentina did not observe its obligations under that Article. There is no manifest excess of powers and no lack of reasoning.94\n\nCMS\u2019 Annulment Rejoinder, para. 32.\n\nIbid., para. 32.\n\nIbid., paras. 34-36.\n\n**(c) The Committee\u2019s view**\n----------------------------\n\n89.\n\nArticle II(2)(c) of the BIT provides that \"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\" It is accepted that by \"obligations\" is meant legal obligations. Although legitimate expectations might arise by reason of a course of dealing between the investor and the host State, these are not, as such, legal obligations, though they may be relevant to the application of the fair and equitable treatment clause contained in the BIT.95\n\nSee *MTD v. Chile,* paras. 67-69.\n\n90.\n\nCMS stated categorically before the Committee that its claim was not predicated on any Argentine law right of CMS to compliance with the terms of the License.96 Moreover, this is in conformity with what the Committee understands to be Argentine law. Under that law, the obligations of Argentina under the License are obligations to TGN, not to CMS, and CMS has no right to enforce them.\n\nSee Hearing on annulment proceedings, 27 March 2007, 206-209, 242-244; also CMS\u2019 Annulment Rejoinder, para. 15.\n\n91.\n\nDuring the hearings, CMS referred to the possibility that an investor might acquire an international law right to compliance with undertakings with regard to investments. But it finally accepted that this was not the basis of its claim before the Tribunal or of the Tribunal\u2019s own reasoning.97\n\nHearing on annulment proceedings, 27 March 2007, 246; 28 March 2007, 514.\n\n92.\n\nIn the end, CMS relied on a literal interpretation of Article II(2)(c). It contended that Argentina entered into legal obligations under the License, which were obligations \"with regard to investments\" under that Article. Although CMS was not entitled as a minority shareholder to invoke those obligations of Argentina under Argentine law (not being the obligee), the effect of Article II(2)(c) was to give it standing to invoke them under the BIT.\n\n93.\n\nIn paragraph 303 of the Award, the Tribunal concluded that \"the obligation under the umbrella clause of Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty has not been observed by the Respondent to the extent that legal and contractual obligations pertinent to the investment have been breached and have resulted in the violation of the standards of protection under the Treaty.\"\n\n94.\n\nIt is implicit in this reasoning that the Tribunal may have accepted the interpretation of Article II(2)(c) referred to in paragraph 92 above. But the Tribunal nowhere addressed this point expressly. Instead it repeatedly referred back to the Decision on Jurisdiction of 17 July 2003, where this specific matter was not dealt with at all.98 Further, the Tribunal\u2019s extended discussion of whether CMS had a right to compliance with the terms of the License and of the Argentine Gas Law99 would have been unnecessary if the basis of its decision was that Article II(2)(c) gave CMS standing to invoke obligations owned to TGN.\n\nSee Award, paras. 132, 148, 299, and cf. Jurisdictional Decision, para. 65.\n\nAward, paras. 127-151.\n\n95.\n\nMoreover there are major difficulties with this broad interpretation of Article II(2)(c).\n\n(a) In speaking of \"any obligations it may have *entered into* with regard to investments\", it seems clear that Article II(2)(c) is concerned with consensual obligations arising independently of the BIT itself *(i.e.* under the law of the host State or possibly under international law). Further they must be specific obligations concerning the investment. They do not cover general requirements imposed by the law of the host State.\n\n(b) Consensual obligations are not entered into *erga omnes* but with regard to particular persons. Similarly the performance of such obligations or requirements occurs with regard to, and as between, obligor and obligee.\n\n(c) The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the *parties* to the obligation *(i.e.,* the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.\n\n(d) The obligation of the State covered by Article II(2)(c) will often be a bilateral obligation, or will be intrinsically linked to obligations of the investment company. Yet a shareholder, though apparently entitled to enforce the company\u2019s rights in its own interest, will not be bound by the company\u2019s obligations, *e.g.* as to dispute settlement.\n\n(e) If the Tribunal\u2019s implicit interpretation is right, then the mechanism in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in unnecessary wherever there is an umbrella clause.\n\n(f) There is no discussion in the award of the *travaux* of the BIT on this point, or of the prior understandings of the proponents of the umbrella clause as to its function.\n\n96.\n\nIn the end it is quite unclear how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion that CMS could enforce the obligations of Argentina to TGN. It could have done so by the above interpretation of Article II(2)(c), but in that case one would have expected a discussion of the issues of interpretation referred to above. Or it could have decided that CMS had an Argentine law right to compliance with the obligations, yet CMS claims no such right; and Argentine law appears not to recognize it.100\n\nSee above, paragraph 90.\n\n97.\n\nIn these circumstances there is a significant lacuna in the Award, which makes it impossible for the reader to follow the reasoning on this point. It is not the case that answers to the question raised \"can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision\";101 they cannot. Accordingly, the Tribunal\u2019s finding on Article II(2)(c) must be annulled for failure to state reasons.\n\n*Wena Hotels,* para. 81.\n\n98.\n\nIn these circumstances it is not necessary for the Committee to decide whether it would have been a manifest excess of powers for the Tribunal to decide that Article II(2)(c) allows CMS to enforce the Argentine law rights of TGN.\n\n99.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal\u2019s finding of liability must be annulled, it does not follow that the Award as a whole is affected. As the *Vivendi* Annulment Committee found,102 severable parts of an award which are not themselves annulled will stand, a situation expressly contemplated in Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Vivendi,* para. 68.\n\n100.\n\nIn the present case the Tribunal\u2019s award of damages was made on the basis of independent findings of breach of Article II(2)(a) and (c) of the BIT. Indeed the Tribunal itself noted that \"the umbrella clauses invoked by the Claimant do not add anything different to the overall Treaty obligations which the Respondent must meet if the plea of necessity fails.\"103 Thus the Committee\u2019s finding on the umbrella clause does not entail the annulment of the Award as a whole. It entails only annulment of the provisions of paragraph 1 of the operative part of the Award under which the Tribunal decided that \"[t]he Respondent breached its obligations... to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty.\"\n\nAward, para. 378.\n\n**G. State of Necessity under Customary International Law and Article XI of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Award**\n-----------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal recorded that \"Argentina has contended in the alternative that in the event the Tribunal should come to the conclusion that there was a breach of the Treaty the Respondent should be exempted from liability in light of the existence of a state of necessity or state of emergency.\"104 Argentina invoked the existence of such a state under both customary international law and Article XI of the BIT. The Tribunal noted that in doing so, Argentina raised \"one fundamental issue\"105 which it examined under customary international law before doing so under the BIT.\n\nIbid., para. 304.\n\nIbid., para. 308.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that Article 25 of the Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on State Responsibility106 \"adequately reflects the state of customary international law on the question of necessity.\"107 Under that article:\n\n\"1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\"\n\nArticles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, annexed to UNGA Resolution 56/83, 14 December 2001.\n\nAward, para. 315.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal then undertook the task of finding whether the Argentine crisis met the various requirements of Article 25. It expressed doubts as to whether \"an essential interest\" of the State was involved in the matter and whether there was in this case a \"grave and imminent peril\".108 It added that the measures taken by Argentina \"were not the only steps available\" to safeguard its interest and concluded that the conditions set out under paragraph 1(a) of Article 25 were not met.109\n\nIbid., paras. 319-322.\n\nIbid., para. 324.\n\n104.\n\nBy contrast the Tribunal decided that neither an essential interest of the United States110 nor an essential interest of the international community as a whole111 had been seriously impaired by the measures taken by Argentina. Accordingly it stated that the plea of necessity would not be precluded by paragraph 1(b) of Article 25.112\n\nIbid., para. 358.\n\nIbid., paras. 325, 358.\n\nIbid., para. 358.\n\n105.\n\nPassing to paragraph 2 of that Article, the Tribunal examined whether the object and purpose of the BIT excluded necessity. It arrived to the conclusion that \"the Argentine crisis was severe but did not result in total economic and social collapse\"113 and that in such a situation the \"Treaty will prevail over any plea of necessity.\"114\n\nIbid., para. 355.\n\nIbid., para. 354.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal further observed that Argentina\u2019s \"government policies and their shortcomings significantly contributed to the crisis\"115 and that consequently state of necessity was precluded by paragraph 2(b) of Article 25.\n\nIbid., para. 329.\n\n107.\n\nFinally the Tribunal observed that all the conditions governing necessity under Article 25 must be cumulatively satisfied.116 It concluded that \"the requirements of necessity under customary international law have not been fully met so as to preclude the wrongfulness of the acts.\"117\n\nIbid., para. 331.\n\nIbid.\n\n108.\n\nThen the Tribunal noted that \"[t]he discussion on necessity and emergency is not confined to customary international law as there are also specific provisions of the Treaty dealing with this matter.\"118 In this respect it first recalled that Article XI of the BIT provides:\n\n\"This treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n\nIbid., para. 332.\n\n109.\n\nIn this respect the Tribunal first determined that \"there is nothing in the context of customary international law or the object and purpose of the Treaty that could on its own exclude major economic crises from the scope of Article XI.\"119 It added that \"[a]gain, the issue is then to establish how grave an economic crisis must be so as to qualify as an essential security interest, a matter discussed above.\"120\n\nIbid., para. 359.\n\nIbid., para. 361.\n\n110.\n\nThen the Tribunal, in the light of a lengthy discussion of the question by the Parties and their experts, expressed the view that \"the clause of Article XI of the Treaty is not a self-judging clause\".121 Accordingly it decided that the judicial review it had to perform under that clause was a \"substantive review\".122\n\nIbid., para. 373.\n\nIbid., para. 374.\n\n**(b) Argentina\u2019s submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nArgentina recalls that before the Tribunal it relied both on Article XI of the BIT and on the doctrine of necessity reflected in Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility. It adds \"[i]t is self-evident that these arguments are related but juridically distinct.\"123 It stresses that \"the Tribunal has conflated the Article XI argument and the necessity argument and failed to distinguish between treaty and customary claims.\"124 By treating these arguments as identical, the Tribunal \"has fallen into fundamental error.\"125 It incorporated \"into the interpretation and application of Article XI the approach imposed by the law of responsibility but without any explanation as to why that is the proper approach.\"126 In doing so it entirely failed to carry out the task of interpreting Article XI and ignored the language of that Article.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, para. 125.\n\nIbid., para. 126.\n\nIbid., para. 127.\n\nIbid., para. 131.\n\n112.\n\nArgentina further contends that the Tribunal wrongly decided that Article XI is not \"self-judging\" and that it must proceed to a substantive review of the measures taken. It adds that having determined that Article XI required such a review, the Tribunal failed to carry it out, or at least to carry out the good faith review proposed by Argentina.127 Nowhere in the Award did the Tribunal carry out any \"analysis of whether the measures in question had been... necessary to maintain public security and its essential security interests in the circumstances that prevailed.\"128\n\nIbid., paras. 136-144.\n\nIbid., para. 155.\n\n113.\n\nArgentina adds that the Tribunal also failed to state reasons for its rejection of Argentina\u2019s defense of necessity under customary international law and that again on that point it manifestly exceeded its authority.129 In this regard, it recalls that \"[t]he Tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s alternative defense of necessity under customary international law on the basis that two of the factors set forth in Article 25 of the ILC\u2019S Draft Articles on State Responsibility were not satisfied: the measures were not the only steps available, and Argentina itself contributed to the crisis.\"130\n\nIbid., para. 180.\n\nIbid., para. 170.\n\n114.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal based its decision on the first point \"on the mere *existence* of different opinions on issues of economic policy, without considering whether the other alternatives were feasible.\"131 Moreover it nowhere addressed the impact of either resorting to the adjustment mechanisms provided in the Gas Law and License, or taking no action in response to the emergency.132\n\nIbid., para. 175 (emphasis in original).\n\nIbid., para. 176.\n\n115.\n\nFurthermore the Tribunal asserted that Argentina substantially contributed to the crisis in two ambiguous sentences without engaging into any real analysis of the alleged \"shortcomings\" in government policies.133\n\nIbid., para. 178.\n\n**(c) CMS\u2019 submissions**\n------------------------\n\n116.\n\nCMS submits that, contrary to what Argentina contends, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers and that there was no failure to state reasons. It stresses that \"[t]o the extent there is any conflating of matters in connection with Article XI and necessity under customary international law, it is Argentina and not the Tribunal that is at fault\"134 According to CMS the Tribunal considered both defenses step by step, separately, in the order in which Argentina pleaded them.135\n\nCMS\u2019 Annulment Counter-Memorial, para. 81.\n\nIbid., para. 91.\n\n117.\n\nCMS moreover contends that the Tribunal correctly rejected Argentina\u2019s defense on necessity under customary international law in stating that Argentina\u2019s measures were not the only steps available to it and that Argentina contributed to the crisis.136 It adds that the Committee has no authority under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention to reconsider the Tribunal\u2019s findings of fact.137\n\nIbid., paras. 115-121.\n\nIbid., para. 120.\n\n118.\n\nCMS further notes that \"after having already rejected Argentina\u2019s defense under customary international law, and after having concluded that Article XI is not self-judging, the Tribunal correctly reverted to customary international law standards as applicable in an analysis of Article XI.\"138 \"[H]aving found that Argentina had failed to satisfy the conditions for establishing that a state of necessity existed, there was no need for the Tribunal to duplicate the same analysis in connection with its review of Article XI.\"139 In any case a review of whether the Tribunal correctly interpreted or applied Article XI in its determination of Argentina\u2019s defense is beyond the scope of the Committee\u2019s mandate.140 \"It is sufficient to note that the Tribunal did - step by step and methodically, whether rightly or wrongly - interpret and apply Article XI in light of customary international law and on the basis of the parties\u2019 submissions.\"141\n\nIbid., para. 84.\n\nIbid., para. 82.\n\nIbid., para. 91.\n\nIbid.\n\n**(d) The Committee\u2019s view**\n----------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Committee will first deal with Argentina\u2019s arguments relating to failure to\n\nstate reasons under Article 52(e) before examining its submissions based on manifest excess of powers under Article 52(b).\n\n*(i) Failure to state reasons*\n------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Committee observes that, in Section D of the Award, the Tribunal dealt with Argentina\u2019s defense based on state of necessity or emergency under customary international law before examining Article XI of the BIT.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law in that field and examined one by one the conditions enumerated in that Article. It took a decision on each of them giving detailed reasons. It arrived to the conclusion that two of those conditions were not fulfilled, recalled that all conditions must be cumulatively satisfied and concluded that the requirement of necessity under customary international law had not been fully met. In that part of the Award, the Tribunal clearly stated its reasons and the Committee has no jurisdiction to consider whether, in doing so, the Tribunal made any error of fact or law.\n\n122.\n\nWith respect to the defense based on Article XI of the BIT, the Tribunal examined the Parties\u2019 arguments and concluded first that \"there is nothing in the context of customary international law or the object and purpose of the Treaty that could on its own exclude major economic crises from the scope of Article XI.\"142 Then it addressed the debate which the parties had chosen to engage in as to whether Article XI is self-judging. The Tribunal concluded that under Article XI it had the authority to proceed to a substantive review and that \"it must examine whether the state of necessity or emergency meet the conditions laid down by customary international law and the treaty provisions and whether it thus is or is not able to preclude wrongfulness.\"143\n\nAward, para. 359.\n\nIbid., para. 374.\n\n123.\n\nThe problem is, however, that the Tribunal stopped there and did not provide any further reasoning at all in respect of its decision under Article XI. To some extent this can be understood in the light of the arguments developed at the time both by Argentina and CMS. Argentina, on the basis of an expert opinion of Professor Anne-Marie Slaughter,144 contended before the Tribunal that Article XI was \"self-judging\" and that as a consequence the Tribunal had to limit itself to consider whether it acted in good faith in invoking this Article. The expert appointed by CMS, Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, in his statement, opposed that thesis and added that Article XI \"must be read in the light of... the well established derogation for necessity now codified in Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility.\"145 Endorsing that opinion at the hearing, CMS submitted that \"Article XI is not self-judging and... its invocation is subject to satisfaction of the test of necessity under international law.146 Argentina took the same approach, conflating \"state of emergency\" and \"state of necessity\" and adding that state of necessity is included in Article XI.147\n\nStatement by Professor Anne Marie Slaughter, Hearing on Merits, 18 August 2004, 1844-1847.\n\nStatement by Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, 17 March 2004, para. 32.\n\nHearing on Merits, 9 August 2004, 110.\n\nIbid., 295, 300.\n\n124.\n\nAlong those lines, the Tribunal evidently considered that Article XI was to be interpreted in the light of the customary international law concerning the state of necessity and that, if the conditions fixed under that law were not met, Argentina\u2019s defense under Article XI was likewise to be rejected.148 Accordingly, having considered the arguments eventually developed by the Parties with respect to Article XI, it did not find it necessary to revert to its previous assessment concerning the application of customary international law and to repeat the conclusions it had arrived at during the course of examination of Argentina\u2019s first defense.\n\nSee Award, paras. 308, 374.\n\n125.\n\nThe motivation of the Award on this point is inadequate. The Tribunal should certainly have been more explicit in specifying, for instance, that the very same reasons which disqualified Argentina from relying on the general law of necessity149 meant that the measures it took could not be considered \"necessary\" for the purpose of Article XI either.\n\nIbid., 320, 323, 324, 329, 355, 356.\n\n126.\n\nBoth Parties however understood the Award in that sense and, before the Committee, CMS noted that the Tribunal incorporated into its interpretation of Article XI the approach it had adopted to the law of state responsibility.150 Argentina did not contest that point and only complained that the Tribunal did not \"proceed to carry out the substantive examination\" which it rightly held was required.151\n\nHearing on Annulment Proceedings, 27 March 2007, 179-182.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, para. 131.\n\n127.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, although the motivation of the Award could certainly have been clearer, a careful reader can follow the implicit reasoning of the Tribunal as indicated in paragraph 124 above. On this point, therefore, the submission of Argentina cannot be upheld.\n\n*(ii) Manifest excess of powers*\n--------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nAs indicated above the Tribunal, as likewise the parties, assimilated the conditions necessary for the implementation of Article XI of the BIT to those concerning the existence of the state of necessity under customary international law. Moreover, following Argentina\u2019s presentation,152 the Tribunal dealt with the defense based on customary law before dealing with the defense drawn from Article XI. Argentina submits before the Committee that in doing so, the Tribunal on both points manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Merits Counter-Memorial, paras. 716-742; Argentina\u2019s Merits Reply, paras. 841-996; Hearing on Merits, 9 August 2004, 100-112, 295-296.\n\n129.\n\nThe Committee observes first that there is some analogy in the language used in Article XI of the BIT and in Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility. The first text mentions \"necessary\" measures and the second relates to the \"state of necessity\". However Article XI specifies the conditions under which the Treaty may be applied, whereas Article 25 is drafted in a negative way: it excludes the application of the state of necessity on the merits, unless certain stringent conditions are met. Moreover, Article XI is a threshold requirement: if it applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply. By contrast, Article 25 is an excuse which is only relevant once it has been decided that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive obligations.\n\n130.\n\nFurthermore Article XI and Article 25 are substantively different. The first covers measures necessary for the maintenance of public order or the protection of each Party\u2019s own essential security interests, without qualifying such measures. The second subordinates the state of necessity to four conditions. It requires for instance that the action taken \"does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole\", a condition which is foreign to Article XI. In other terms the requirements under Article XI are not the same as those under customary international law as codified by Article 25, as the Parties in fact recognized during the hearing before the Committee.153 On that point, the Tribunal made a manifest error of law.\n\nHearing on Annulment Proceedings, 27 March 2007, 339-340; 28 March 2007, 69-70, 177.\n\n131.\n\nThose two texts having a different operation and content, it was necessary for the Tribunal to take a position on their relationship and to decide whether they were both applicable in the present case. The Tribunal did not enter into such an analysis, simply assuming that Article XI and Article 25 are on the same footing.\n\n132.\n\nIn doing so the Tribunal made another error of law. One could wonder whether state of necessity in customary international law goes to the issue of wrongfulness or that of responsibility. But in any case, the excuse based on customary international law could only be subsidiary to the exclusion based on Article XI.\n\n133.\n\nIf state of necessity means that there has not been even a *prima facie* breach of the BIT, it would be, to use the terminology of the ILC, a primary rule of international law. But this is also the case with Article XI. In other terms, and to take the words of the International Court of Justice in a comparable case, if the Tribunal was satisfied by the arguments based on Article XI, it should have held that there had been \"no breach\" of the BIT.154 Article XI and Article 25 thus construed would cover the same field and the Tribunal should have applied Article XI as the *lex specialis* governing the matter and not Article 25.\n\n*Case concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),* Judgment on Merits, 6 November 2003, para 34.\n\n134.\n\nIf, on the contrary, state of necessity in customary international law goes to the issue of responsibility, it would be a secondary rule of international law - and this was the position taken by the ILC.155 In this case, the Tribunal would have been under an obligation to consider first whether there had been any breach of the BIT and whether such a breach was excluded by Article XI. Only if it concluded that there was conduct not in conformity with the Treaty would it have had to consider whether Argentina\u2019s responsibility could be precluded in whole or in part under customary international law.\n\nSee the discussion reported in *ILC Ybk 1999* vol 11(2), 73-74, 85; ILC, Commentary to Part 1, Chapter V, paras. (2)-(4), (7).\n\n135.\n\nThese two errors made by the Tribunal could have had a decisive impact on the operative part of the Award. As admitted by CMS, the Tribunal gave an erroneous interpretation to Article XI. In fact, it did not examine whether the conditions laid down by Article XI were fulfilled and whether, as a consequence, the measures taken by Argentina were capable of constituting, even *prima facie,* a breach of the BIT. If the Committee was acting as a court of appeal, it would have to reconsider the Award on this ground.\n\n136.\n\nThe Committee recalls, once more, that it has only a limited jurisdiction under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. In the circumstances, the Committee cannot simply substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal. Notwithstanding the identified errors and lacunas in the Award, it is the case in the end that the Tribunal applied Article XI of the Treaty. Although applying it cryptically and defectively, it applied it. There is accordingly no manifest excess of powers.\n\n**H. Temporary Character of Necessity and Consequences for Compensation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Award**\n-----------------\n\n137.\n\nAfter having decided that the requirements of necessity under customary international law and Article XI of the BIT had not been met and having rejected Argentina\u2019s defense in this respect, the Tribunal considered the consequences to be drawn for those conclusions as far as compensation was concerned. It recalled that under Article 27 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility:\n\n\"The invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this chapter is without prejudice to:\n\n(a) compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists;\n\n(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.\"\n\nThe Tribunal declared itself \"satisfied that Article 27 establishes the appropriate rule of international law on this issue.\"156 It added that \"[e]ven if the plea of necessity were accepted, compliance with the obligation would reemerge as soon as the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer existed, which is the case at present.\"157 It concluded that \"any suspension of the right to compensation is strictly temporary, and that this right is not extinguished by the crisis events.\"158\n\nAward, para. 390.\n\nAward, para. 382. The Tribunal had already decided that the crisis period came to an end \"sometime between late 2004 and early 2005\" (para. 250).\n\nAward, para. 392.\n\n138.\n\nPassing to the determination of the compensation due, the Tribunal calculated it on the basis of the damages suffered by CMS from 2000 to 2027.159\n\nAward, para. 419.\n\n**(b) Argentina\u2019s submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nArgentina submits that Article 27 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility \"does not require the payment of compensation for measures subject to the defense of necessity.\"160 According to Argentina, this text only contemplates the possibility of such a compensation in certain cases and does not attempt to specify in which circumstances compensation could be payable. It adds that, in the present case, the matter is governed by Article XI of the BIT, which necessarily excludes compensation.161\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Memorial, para. 162.\n\nIbid., para. 161.\n\n140.\n\nArgentina moreover contests \"the Tribunal\u2019s view that the period of necessity was temporary\"162 and contends that \"The tribunal entirely failed to consider the possibility that the continuing stability following the crisis *depended upon the continuation* of precisely the type of measures at issue in the case before it... Furthermore, the Tribunal\u2019s view that the period of necessity was temporary cannot be reconciled with its award of damages for harm allegedly incurred *during* the period of necessity.\"163\n\nIbid., para. 160.\n\nIbid., para. 160.\n\n141.\n\nThus, according to Argentina, the Award must on that point be annulled for manifest excess of power.\n\n**(c) CMS\u2019 submissions**\n------------------------\n\n142.\n\nCMS submits that \"Argentina\u2019s requested review of the Tribunal\u2019s finding as to the temporary nature of the emergency falls outside the Committee\u2019s mandate for several reasons.\"164 In fact \"[t]he Tribunal\u2019s discussion of this issue constituted *obiter dicta...* and could not be identified as a manifest excess of power.\"165 Moreover \"it is not open to the Committee to second-guess the factual findings of the Tribunal.\"166\n\nCMS\u2019 Annulment Counter-Memorial, para. 93.\n\nIbid., para. 94.\n\nIbid., para. 96.\n\n143.\n\nCMS also contends that \"the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of Argentina\u2019s obligation to pay compensation retroactively in the event of a state of necessity was *obiter dicta,* in light of the Tribunal\u2019s prior rejection of Argentina\u2019s defenses based on Article XI and customary international law.\"167 Moreover, on this point, the Award is consistent with both Parties\u2019 positions before the Tribunal.\n\nIbid., para. 100.\n\n**(d) The Committee\u2019s view**\n----------------------------\n\n144.\n\nIn paragraphs 379 to 394 of the Award, the Tribunal analyzed Article 27 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility concerning the temporary nature of necessity and the conditions under which compensation might be due even if necessity is established.\n\n145.\n\nThe Committee observes that Article 27 covers cases in which the state of necessity precludes wrongfulness under customary international law. In the present case, the Tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s defense based on state of necessity. Thus Article 27 was not applicable and the paragraphs relating to that Article were *obiter dicta* which could not have any bearing on the operative part of the Award.\n\n146.\n\nHowever the Committee finds it necessary to observe that here again the Tribunal made a manifest error of law. Article 27 concerns, *inter alia,* the consequences of the existence of the state of necessity in customary international law, but before considering this Article, even by way of *obiter dicta,* the Tribunal should have considered what would have been the possibility of compensation under the BIT if the measures taken by Argentina had been covered by Article XI. The answer to that question is clear enough: Article XI, if and for so long as it applied, excluded the operation of the substantive provisions of the BIT. That being so, there could be no possibility of compensation being payable during that period.\n\n147.\n\nMoreover the Committee notes that Article 27 itself is a \"without prejudice\" clause, not a stipulation. It refers to \"the question of compensation\" and does not attempt to specify in which circumstances compensation could be due, notwithstanding the state of necessity.168\n\nSee the ILC\u2019s commentary on Article 27, paras. (1), (6): *Yearbook of the International Law Commission* 2001, vol. 11(2), 209, 211.\n\n148.\n\nParagraphs 379 to 394 of the Award being *obiter dicta,* it remains to be seen on which basis the Tribunal decided that compensation was due by Argentina to CMS for the damage suffered by it from 2000 to 2027.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal had already decided that Argentina had breached its international obligations under Article II(2)(a) and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT. It also decided that in the present case there was no state of necessity and did so in terms which, by necessary inference, excluded also the application of Article XI. Thus, under the well-known principle of international law recalled in Article 1 of the ILC Articles, Argentina was responsible for the wrongful measures it had taken.\n\n150.\n\nThe Committee concludes that, whatever may have been the errors made in this respect by the Tribunal, there is no manifest excess of powers or lack of reasoning in the part of the Award concerning Article XI of the BIT and state of necessity under customary international law.\n\n**I. Compensation**\n-------------------\n\n**(a) The Award**\n-----------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal, in the absence of an agreed form of restitution, determined in paragraphs 409 to 469 the amount of compensation due by Argentina to CMS. For that purpose it decided to resort to the standard of fair market value and to calculate that value in using the discounted cash flow method. It noted that the expert chosen by CMS was the only one who estimated the value loss suffered by CMS on its TGN\u2019s shares. It took that estimation as a starting point, but appointed its own experts and in the light of their report modified on a number of points the initial estimation. After that modification, it arrived \"at a DCF loss valuation of US$133.2 million for the Claimant on August 17, 2000, representing the compensation owed in that regard by the Respondent to the Claimant at that date\".169 It decided that Argentina must pay that amount. It added that:\n\n\"Upon payment of the compensation decided in this Award, the Claimant shall transfer to the Respondent the ownership of its shares in TGN upon payment by the Respondent of the additional sum of US$2,148,100. The Respondent shall have up to one year after the date this Award is dispatched to the parties to accept such transfer.\"170\n\nThe Tribunal then fixed the interest to be paid.171\n\nAward, para. 468.\n\nIbid., sub-para. 3 of the *dispositif.*\n\nIbid., paras. 470-471.\n\n**(b) The Parties\u2019 submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal failed \"to explain why a percentage of a value of the *company* should be the basis for granting compensation to a *shareholder* in a case where there has been no expropriation. The Award goes on to put this principle into practice without any adequate explanation for the figures chosen.\"172 Moreover, according to Argentina, the Tribunal contradicted itself in deciding that no expropriation had taken place and in using the standard of compensation applicable in case of expropriation.173 It made its calculation without giving the reasons of many of its assumptions. \"[T]he Award provides no reasons for the conclusion that CMS - rather than simply TGN - had the right to calculate tariffs in dollars, obtain PPI tariff adjustments, and benefit from the purported stabilization clause in the License.\"174\n\nArgentina\u2019s Annulment Reply, para. 99.\n\nIbid., para. 101.\n\nIbid., para. 100.\n\n153.\n\nCMS, for its part, stresses that the Tribunal highlighted its reasons for adopting the fair market value standard for a breach of Article II of the BIT and clearly explained the methodology it used for that purpose in the light of the various experts\u2019 reports.175 Moreover, no contradiction can be noted in the Award, the substance of which cannot be reviewed by the Committee.176\n\nCMS\u2019 Annulment Counter-Memorial, paras. 170-173.\n\nIbid., paras. 173-174.\n\n**(c) The Committee\u2019s view**\n----------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Award is one of the most detailed decisions on damages in ICSID case-law. Under the title \"Remedies\", the Tribunal considered the matter in 25 pages. It declared itself \"persuaded that the cumulative nature of the breaches discussed here is best dealt with by resorting to the standard of [compensation known as the] fair market value.\"177 It specified that \"[w]hile this standard figures prominently in respect of expropriation, it is not excluded that it might also be appropriate for breaches different from expropriation if their effect results in important long-term losses.\"178 In doing so, the Tribunal clearly explained its reasons and did not contradict its decision dismissing CMS\u2019s claim of expropriation.\n\nAward, para. 410.\n\nIbid.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal then listed the various methods which could be retained to calculate the fair market value and concluded for reasons given in paragraphs 411 to 417 of the Award that the discounted cash flow method (DCF) was the one \"that should be retained.\"179\n\nIbid., para. 411.\n\n156.\n\nPassing to the evaluation of the damages, the Tribunal carefully examined the reports of the experts chosen by both parties, in the light of the report of its own experts. It used the \"direct equity value\" method to compute the value of the firm and its securities.180 Starting from the assumptions which were the basis of CMS\u2019s expert report, it modified them on a number of points in specifying the reasons of each modification. In particular, it examined two different DCF scenarios: one in the \"no regulatory change\" context (\"without pesification\") and the other for the post-measures \"new regulatory context\" (\"with pesification\").181 This last scenario was to take into account the impact of Argentina\u2019s crisis on TGN\u2019s performance in the absence of the measures complained of by CMS. Thus and contrary to what is contented by Argentina this element was taken into consideration.\n\nIbid., paras. 430-433.\n\nIbid., para. 422.\n\n157.\n\nThe Committee accordingly concludes that there was no lack of reasoning or contradiction in the reasoning with respect both to the standard of compensation retained by the Tribunal and to the calculation of damages made by it.\n\n**J. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n158.\n\nThroughout its consideration of the Award, the Committee has identified a series of errors and defects. The Award contained manifest errors of law. It suffered from lacunae and elisions. All this has been identified and underlined by the Committee. However the Committee is conscious that it exercises its jurisdiction under a narrow and limited mandate conferred by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. The scope of this mandate allows annulment as an option only when certain specific conditions exist. As stated already (paragraph 136 above), in these circumstances the Committee cannot simply substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal.\n\n159.\n\nIn the event Argentina\u2019s application for annulment must be upheld as far as the umbrella clause is concerned. The other claims of Argentina are dismissed.\n\n160.\n\nAs a consequence the stay of enforcement maintained by the Decision of the Committee of September 1, 2006 is automatically lifted as from the date of the present Decision, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(3). Consequently, payment by Argentina of the sum awarded is again obligatory: see paragraph 15 above, and this reactivates the Award\u2019s stipulation182 that, on payment of the amount due plus an additional US$2,148,100, CMS\u2019 shares in TGN are to be transferred to Argentina. Pursuant to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention (as applied to annulment proceedings by Article 52(4)), the Committee decides that Argentina has 228 days from the date this Decision is dispatched to the Parties to accept the transfer of ownership of CMS\u2019 shares in TGN, as provided for in sub-paragraph 3 of the *dispositif to* the Award.\n\nAward, sub-para. (3) of the *dispositif,* and see paragraph 10 above.\n\n161.\n\nThe ruling on the costs of the proceedings before the Tribunal stands. It remains to deal with the question of the costs of the annulment proceedings, as to which the Committee has a discretion. In all but one of the concluded annulment proceedings, Committees have held that ICSID costs should be borne equally by the Parties.183 In the circumstances of the present case the Committee proposes to follow the existing practice.\n\nSee *MTD v. Chile,* para. 110 (fn 139).\n\n162.\n\nThe costs of the Parties\u2019 own representation during the annulment proceedings are likewise within the Committee\u2019s discretion. In view of the decision of partial annulment, and having regard to all the circumstances, the Committee decides to make no order as to the costs of representation before it.\n\n**K. Decision**\n---------------\n\n163.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee decides:\n\n(1) Sub-paragraph 1 of the *dispositif* of the Award is annulled as far as it provided that \"The Respondent breached its obligations... to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty.\"\n\n(2) The other claims of the Argentine Republic are dismissed.\n\n(3) Argentina has 228 days after the date this Decision is dispatched to the Parties to accept the transfer of ownership of CMS shares in TGN as provided for in sub-paragraph 3 of the *dispositif* to the Award.\n\n(4) Each Party shall bear one half of the costs incurred by the Centre in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(5) Each Party shall bear its own costs of representation in connection with this annulment proceeding."}]}
