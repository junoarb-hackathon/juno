BACKGROUND\n-------------\n\n[1].\n\nIn order to understand the main events which led up to this dispute and to identify the various Parties directly or indirectly involved, the Arbitral Tribunal felt it useful to briefly describe the background and the occurrences which led to this Arbitration.\n\n[2].\n\nThe Las Cristinas property is located in the south eastern corner of Venezuela in the State of Bolivar. It consists of a number of mining concessions held by Venezuela through the Ministry of Energy and Mines. It contains what is reported to be one of the largest gold reserves in the world.\n\n[3].\n\nCorporaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Guayana (\"CVG\") is a Government agency created in 1960 to oversee the economic development of the Guayana Region in Bolivar State, where the Las Cristinas (\"Las Cristinas\") property is located.\n\n[4].\n\nPlacer Dome, Inc. (\"PDI\") was a Canadian corporation with its head office in Vancouver. It was listed on various stock exchanges and described as one of the largest gold mining companies of the world. In 2006, it was acquired and absorbed into by Barrick Gold Corporation which has its headquarters in Toronto, Canada and is quoted on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. After a selection process, PDI was selected for the development of the gold mines in the Las Cristinas concessions 4, 5, 6 and 7. For this purpose, CVG entered on 25 July 1991 into a Shareholders Agreement (\"Shareholders Agreement 1991\")1 with PDI. According to this Agreement, two mining companies were formed, Minera Las Cristinas (\"MINCA\") and Relaves Mineros Las Cristinas (\"REMINCA\"). The purpose of MINCA was to initially explore and, if economic feasibility is established, produce gold in Las Cristinas 4, 5, 6 and 7. REMINCA was to evaluate and, if economic feasibility is established, process existing tailings on Las Cristinas 4 and 5. REMINCA is apparently not directly at issue in this Arbitration.\n\nCD-5.\n\n[5].\n\nSeventy percent of the shares of the capital stock of MINCA were subscribed by Placer Dome de Venezuela, C.A. identified as the \"PDI Investor\", a domestic Venezuelan company (\"PDV\"). Apparently for tax purposes, the shares of PDV were not held directly by the Canadian parent company PDI, but through an intermediary company Placer Dome Ltd. (Barbados) (\"PD Barbados\"). CVG in turn held 30% of the shares of MINCA.\n\n[6].\n\nOn 4 March 1992, CVG and MINCA entered into a Work Contract to explore and exploit Las Cristinas (\"Work Contract\")2. This contract designated MINCA as the sole and exclusive operator for the exploration, development and exploitation of Las Cristinas 4, 5, 6 and 7 for an initial period of twenty years with extensions of additional ten year periods so long as the project remained economically feasible.\n\nCD-20.\n\n[7].\n\nUpon the discovery of the presence of copper on the Las Cristinas property, the Ministry of Energy and Mines issued copper concessions to CVG for Las Cristinas 4, 5, 6 and 7 on 30 December 19963. These copper concessions were transferred to MINCA on 28 January 19994.\n\nCD-39.\n\nCD-40.\n\n[8].\n\nBetween 1995 and 1998, Pre-Feasibility Studies, Feasibility Studies and Updates thereto were prepared5.\n\nCD-29.\n\n[9].\n\nThe July 1996 Feasibility Study Update was approved: (i) by the MINCA Board of Directors at a meeting held on 1 August 19966; and (ii) by the Ministry of Energy and Mines by letter dated 26 June 19977:\n\nCD-32.\n\nCD-33.\n\n[10].\n\nIn view of the increased financial needs for the construction phase, the shareholders of MINCA in August 1996 agreed to a re-organization of the corporate structure whereby PDV\u2019s shareholding would be increased from 70% to 95% and CVG\u2019s shareholding reduced from 30% to 5% with an option for CVG to increase its ownership to 30% in the future through cash and non-cash contributions8. This re-organization was formalized in the 1997 Amended Shareholders Agreement entered into on 31 July 1997 (Shareholders Agreement 1997)9.\n\nCD-43.\n\nCD-30\n\n[11].\n\nFor various reasons and from 1999 onwards, mainly because of the important decline of the price of gold, exploitation was apparently never really commenced and at a Board of Directors Meeting of MINCA held on 15 July 1999 the Project was suspended10.\n\nCD-57.\n\n[12].\n\nAfter MINCA had made the decision to further suspend its activities, CVG, PDI, PDV and MINCA entered into an agreement on 8 August 200011 according to which the suspension of the performance of the Work Contract was extended for a further year from 15 July 2000.\n\nCD-60.\n\n[13].\n\nDuring this time, attempts were made to review the strategic options for the property with the help of an investment advisor and to find a third-party investor to become involved in the project. PDI also made a formal proposal to CVG to sell its interest in MINCA in exchange for future royalty payments to it. No agreements were reached between the Parties regarding the future direction of the project.\n\n[14].\n\nIn October 2000, General Rangel Gomez became President of CVG. He wrote a letter on 11 July 2001 to the Minister of Energy and Mines informing him that CVG intended to assume total control of MINCA12.\n\nCD-90.\n\n[15].\n\nOn 13 July 2001, the \"Original Transaction Agreement (PBV)\" was entered into which provided among other things for Vannessa Ventures Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada (\"Vannessa\" or \"the Claimant\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary IHC Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of Barbados and PD Barbados to acquire the PDV shares and certain loans.\n\n[16].\n\nGeneral Rangel Gomez, President of CVG, was informed in writing by William M. Hayes, Executive Vice President - United States and Latin America, about this transaction which was publicly announced the same day13.\n\nCD-95.\n\n[17].\n\nOn 14 July 2001, General Rangel Gomez wrote a letter to PDV according to which CVG did not acknowledge or agree with this share sales agreement14.\n\nCD-97.\n\n[18].\n\nThe transaction was closed on 25 July 2001 when the Original Transaction Agreement (PBV) was replaced by the Transaction Agreement (PBV)15 between PD Barbados, Vannessa and Vannessa Holdings Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Barbados (\"Vannessa Barbados\"). PDV later changed its name to Vannessa Venezuela C.A.\n\nCD-4.\n\n[19].\n\nOn 6 August 2001, CVG proceeded to rescind the Work Contract upon 90 days notice of breach to MINCA16.\n\nCD-109.\n\n[20].\n\nOn 6 November 2001, 90 days after CVG\u2019s notice of breach, CVG issued a formal notice of termination of the Work Contract and granted MINCA an additional seven days to vacate Las Cristinas17.\n\nCD-148.\n\n[21].\n\nOn 16 November 2001, CVG forcefully took possession of the Las Cristinas mine site.\n\n[22].\n\nOn 8 March 2002, the Ministry of Energy and Mines issued two Resolutions, Resolution 3518 transferring to the Republic the Las Cristinas gold concessions and Resolution 3619 declaring MINCA\u2019s concession to the Las Cristinas copper concessions expired.\n\nCD-166.\n\nCD 167.\n\n[23].\n\nOn 29 April 2002, President Chavez issued a Presidential Decree reserving Las Cristinas gold concessions for direct exploitation by the Government of Venezuela20. This Decree was published on 7 May 2002.\n\nCD-172.\n\n[24].\n\nOn 10 September 2002, President Chavez issued a further Presidential Decree reserving the copper concessions for direct exploitation, which Decree was published on 12 March 200321.\n\nCD-173.\n\n2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n---------------------\n\n2.1. Arbitration Agreement and Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[25].\n\nOn July 9, 2004, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received an arbitration request from Vannessa Ventures S.A. (\"the Claimant\") against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"the Respondent\" or \"Venezuela\") under the ICSID Additional Facility Mechanism provided by the 1996 Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"BIT\").\n\n[26].\n\nBy letters of August 23 and September 15, 2004, the Claimant supplemented its Request for Arbitration.\n\n[27].\n\nOn October 28, 2004, the Secretary-General informed the Parties of his approval to access the Additional Facility Mechanism pursuant to Article 4(5) of the Additional Facility Rules. On the same day, the Secretary-General registered the request and invited the Parties to proceed with the constitution of an arbitral tribunal pursuant to Article 5(a) and (e) of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules.\n\n[28].\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, it was decided that pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators, with one appointed by each party, and the third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n[29].\n\nOn January 27, 2005, the Claimant appointed the Honorable Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator. On February 15, 2005, the Respondent appointed Mr. Jan Paulsson, a national of France, as arbitrator.\n\n[30].\n\nOn May 20, 2005, the Parties informed the Centre that they had jointly appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder, a British national, as the third and presiding arbitrator.\n\n[31].\n\nOn June 7, 2005, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties and the above-mentioned arbitrators that the Tribunal had been constituted and the proceeding deemed to have begun on that day in accordance with Article 13(1) of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules. On the same date, the Parties were informed that Mr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rivas, ICSID Counsel, had been appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal in this case. Later on, Mr. Rivas was replaced by Dr. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, ICSID Counsel.\n\n2.2. Proceedings\n----------------\n\n[32].\n\nOn July 29, 2005, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties in London. Present at the session were:\n\n- The Members of the Tribunal,\n\n- The Secretary of the Tribunal,\n\n- On behalf of the Claimants: Messrs. John Terry and Ms. Julie Maclean of Torys LLP, and\n\n- On behalf of the Respondent: Mr. Ronald Goodman of Winston & Strawn LLP.\n\n[33].\n\nDuring the session, the Tribunal decided on several procedural matters and, in agreement with the Parties, set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 respective submissions and production of documents. This timetable was later amended on several occasions per the Parties\u2019 requests.\n\n[34].\n\nOn January 13, 2006, in accordance with the amended timetable, the Claimant submitted its Memorial.\n\n[35].\n\nOn February 28, 2006, the Claimant submitted an amendment to its Request for Arbitration. After hearing the Respondent\u2019s objections to this request, the Tribunal decided, pursuant to Articles 35 and 47 of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, to grant the Claimant\u2019s request and to introduce the amendment as an ancillary claim.\n\n2.3. Proceeding on Jurisdiction\n-------------------------------\n\n[36].\n\nOn July 5, 2006, the Respondent raised objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and requested a suspension of the proceedings in accordance with Additional Facility Arbitration Rule 45(4). On July 10, 2006, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s challenge and request.\n\n[37].\n\nOn July 14, 2006, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal had suspended the proceeding in accordance with Article 45(4) of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules and set out a schedule for the Parties\u2019 respective submissions on jurisdiction. The schedule was modified twice subsequently per the Parties\u2019 requests.\n\n[38].\n\nIn accordance with the revised schedule, the Respondent on August 28, 2006, submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction. On December 16, 2006, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. On February 16, 2007, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction, and on February 16, 2007, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n[39].\n\nOn April 25, 2007, the Tribunal was provided with a revised list of participants for the upcoming hearing on jurisdiction. Among the persons listed as representing the Claimant was Prof. Christopher Greenwood. On April 27, 2007, the Centre transmitted to the Parties further declarations by two Tribunal members with respect to Prof. Greenwood. On May 3, 2007, the Respondent submitted its observations on the further declarations. On May 4, 2007, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide any observations which it might have with respect to the Respondent\u2019s letter in this matter. The Claimant provided its observations the same day.\n\n[40].\n\nAs agreed, on May 7, 2007, the hearing on jurisdiction took place in London. At the hearing, the following persons appeared as legal counsel and representatives for the Claimant: Messrs. John Laskin and John Terry and Mesdames Julie Maclean and Ruth Anne Flear of Torys LLP, as well as Prof. Greenwood of Essex Chambers. Ms. Marianna Almeida and Messrs. John Morgan and Ross Melrose, all of Vanessa Ventures Ltd., also appeared as representatives of the Claimant.\n\n[41].\n\nThe following persons appeared on behalf of the Respondent as its legal counsel and representatives: Messrs. Ronald Goodman, Dmitri Evseev, Bonard Molina-Garcia and Kelby Ballena and Mesdames Cristina Sorgi and Margarita S\u00e1nchez, all of Winston & Strawn LLP; Mr. Paolo Di Rosa and Ms. Gaela Gehring Flores of Arnold & Porter LLP, and Messrs. Gustavo \u00c1lvarez and Tulio Cusman of the Procuraduria General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\n[42].\n\nDuring the session, after hearing the Parties\u2019 positions regarding the participation of Prof. Greenwood in the case, the President of the Tribunal submitted his resignation. His resignation was accepted by his two co-arbitrators, Judge Brower and Mr. Paulsson, in accordance with the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules. Before the session ended, Mr. Paulsson also submitted, with the Parties\u2019 consent, his resignation for personal reasons. The proceeding was consequently suspended until the vacancies on the Tribunal were filled according to Additional Facility Arbitration Rule 17(1).\n\n2.4. Reconstitution of the Tribunal and Resumption of the Proceeding on Jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[43].\n\nOn June 21, 2007, the Respondent appointed Prof. Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as an arbitrator to replace Mr. Paulsson. On October 18, 2007, the Respondent and the Claimant separately informed the Centre that the Parties had agreed to appoint Dr. Robert Briner, a national of Switzerland, as the third, presiding arbitrator to replace Mr. Veeder.\n\n[44].\n\nOn October 29, 2007, after Dr. Briner had accepted his appointment, the Tribunal was deemed to have been reconstituted and the proceeding to have resumed.\n\n[45].\n\nOn November 29, 2007, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the hearing on jurisdiction would be held in Pahs on February 14 and 15, 2008. On December 28, 2007, the Tribunal confirmed these dates, and noted that February 16 could be added if necessary. On January 31, 2008, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement on a proposed schedule for the hearing. On February 7, 2008, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its approval of the proposed schedule.\n\n[46].\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held in Pahs on February 14 and 15, 2008. At the hearing, the following persons appeared as legal counsel and representatives for the Claimant: Messrs. John Laskin and John Terry and Ms. Ruth Anne Flear of Torys LLP, and Prof. Christopher Greenwood of Essex Chambers. The following persons also appeared as representatives of the Claimant: Ms. Marianna Almeida and Messrs. John Morgan and Ross Melrose, all of Vanessa Ventures Ltd.\n\n[47].\n\nThe following persons appeared as legal counsel and representatives for the Respondent: Messrs. Ronald Goodman and Paul Reichler and Mesdames Janis Brennan, Geraldine Fischer and Ang\u00e9lica Villagr\u00e1n-Ag\u00fcero of Foley Hoag LLP, Ms. Gaela Gehring Flores and Messrs. Dmitri Evseev, Bonard Molina-Garcia and Kelby Ballena of Arnold & Porter LLP, and Mr. Gustavo Alvarez of the Procuraduria General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Messrs. Carlos Mouri\u00f1o Vaquero, Luis Garc\u00eda Montoya and Gustavo Grau Fortoul also appeared as independent experts/advisers for the Respondent.\n\n3. JURISDICTION\n---------------\n\n3.1. Introduction\n-----------------\n\n[48].\n\nThe Respondent in the letter of its counsel to ICSID of 5 July 2005 raised four jurisdictional objections:\n\n***Summary of Objections***\n\n***1. This dispute arises directly out of the Republic\u2019s decision not to permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise by Claimant, and therefore falls squarely within the exclusion from investor-state arbitration agreed by the Contracting Parties under the Agreement Between The Government of Canada and the Government of The Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"BIT\"), Annex Article 11(3) (b) (the \"acquisition exception\").***\n\n*The investor-state dispute resolution provisions pursuant to which this case has been registered with ICSID are contained in Article XII of the BIT. However, Annex Article II(3)(b) of the BIT states:*\n\n*Decisions by either Contracting Party not to permit establishment of a new business enterprise or acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise by investors or prospective investors shall not be subject to the provisions of Article XII of this Agreement.*\n\n*Clearly, a dispute that arises directly out of a Contracting Party\u2019s decision not to permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise is outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. As the Republic will demonstrate, the present dispute fits squarely within the jurisdiction exclusion of Annex Article II(3)(b), because it stems from the Republic\u2019s refusal to permit Claimant\u2019s takeover of MINCA, the business enterprise at issue in this proceeding.*\n\n***2. Claimant has never acquired any rights to Las Cristinas or did so in a manner contrary to the Republic\u2019s laws.***\n\n*Vannessa\u2019s alleged rights to Las Cristinas stem from the 25 July 2001 Transaction Agreement with Placer B-V, an offshore subsidiary of Placer Dome. Under that agreement, Vannessa, contrary to the Amended Shareholder\u2019s Agreement, purported to assume all obligations of Placer Dome under the Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement and all other related documents. (See Cl. Ex.* *4, \u00a7 2.02(b)). At the same time, Placer B-V disclaimed any warranties as to the nature, validity or assignability of any of the rights purportedly being transferred.* *(See id. At \u00a7 2.04(a)). In fact, Placer B-V\u2019s attempted assignment of any rights to* *Las Cristinas to Vannessa was invalid. As a result, Claimant has never possessed any legitimate rights to Las Cristinas under the Amended Shareholders Agreement or related documents, and has no standing to bring such claims before this Tribunal.*\n\n*Furthermore, even if Vannessa did acquire rights to MINCA, such rights were acquired in a manner that prevents them from being classified as an \"investment\" under the BIT. Article Iff) of the BIT requires that an \"investment\" in the territory of a Contracting Party be \"in accordance with the latter\u2019s laws. \" It therefore flows that an acquisition that takes place in circumvention of explicit statutory and contractual prohibitions cannot serve as the basis of any claims under the BIT because it does not meet the BIT\u2019S definition of an \"investment\", to which the substantive protections of the BIT attach.*\n\n*Here, the 25 July 2001 Transaction Agreement and surrounding events point to a scheme devised by Placer Dome and Vannessa in an unlawful attempt to force CVG and the Republic to accept a new and unknown own entity in place of Placer Dome, just as the final extension of the MINCA work contract was set to expire. It can hardly be doubted that the Contracting Parties intended to exclude from the scope of their consent to arbitrate disputes concerning alleged rights acquired under such circumstances.*\n\n***3. Vannessa has not waived its right to initiate or continue proceedings in*** ***relation to the subject matter of this dispute in the courts of Venezuela, and has therefore failed to comply with an essential jurisdictional requirement of Article XII (3) (b) of the BIT***\n\n*Article XII (3)(b) of the BIT states that an investor may refer a dispute to arbitration under the BIT only where*\n\n*The investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind.*\n\n*Article XII (12) (a) of the BIT confirms that the waiver constitutes a jurisdictional requirement*\n\n*Where an investor brings a claim under this Article regarding loss or damage suffered by an enterprise the investor directly or indirectly owns or controls, the following provisions shall apply:*\n\n*...(ii) both the investor and the enterprise must give the waiver referred to in subparagraph (3)(b)....*\n\n*On 8 July 2004, Vannessa filed its Request for Arbitration in the present case. On that date, Vannessa also submitted statements on behalf of itself, Vannessa Venezuela and MINCA, purporting to waive the right to initiate or continue any proceedings within the meaning of Article XII(3)(b). At the time,* *however, MINCA and Vannessa had no fewer than ten cases pending before the Political-Administrative Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court based on the same facts as its ICSID claims (\"related proceedings\"), and had taken no affirmative steps to withdraw many of them.*\n\n*In one such case, the Political-Administrative Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court rendered a final judgment against MINCA a week after Vannessa filed its Request for Arbitration. Then, on 15 September 2004, MINCA filed a new claim, seeking extraordinary review and nullification of that decision by the Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court.*\n\n*Over the next two months, in the context of Venezuela\u2019s opposition to the registration of Vannessa\u2019s Request for Arbitration (partly on the basis of Article XII(3)(b)), Vannessa and MINCA filed motions to discontinue the related proceedings (except the case mentioned in the preceding paragraph). These motions, however, specifically reserved the right to initiate future proceedings based on the same claims.*\n\n*Venezuelan law recognizes two forms of voluntary withdrawal of a claim, one of which is with prejudice to future suits and the other without prejudice. Depending on the stage of the proceeding, withdrawal without prejudice may require consent of the opposing party and/or of the court. Withdrawal with prejudice does not. As of today, none of the related proceedings has been withdrawn with prejudice by Vannessa.*\n\n*The BIT, however, is unequivocal in its requirement that an investor must renounce its right not only to continue ongoing litigations, but also to initiate new ones, before its Request for Arbitration can be validly submitted. In other words, the BIT requires a legally binding waiver of claims, which must be with prejudice to the filing of future claims. Venezuela first drew attention to Vannessa\u2019s non-compliance with Article XII(3)(b) shortly after the filing of the Request for Arbitration. Nevertheless, Vannessa has failed to take sufficient steps to follow through on the waivers submitted to the Tribunal. To the contrary, Vannessa\u2019s and MINCA \u2019s conduct in the courts of Venezuela subsequent to the filing of the Request for Arbitration demonstrates that it is unwilling to act in accordance with the waivers submitted to the Tribunal. Because the waivers are an essential jurisdictional requirement under Article XTI of the BIT, Claimant\u2019s case must be dismissedforthwith.*\n\n***4. In its Request for Arbitration, Claimant failed to assert a claim under the BIT with respect to the cancellation of MINCA\u2019s copper concessions.***\n\n*In accordance with Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT,*\n\n*An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:*\n\n*(d) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.*\n\n*MINCA\u2019s copper concessions were officially cancelled by the MEM on 8 March 2002, by means of a public resolution, and with notice of the same to MINCA. Thus, MINCA and Vannessa became aware of the alleged breach no later than 8 March 2002. To the extent that Vannessa brings forth claims for \"loss and damages suffered by Vannessa and its investments... Vannessa Venezuela... and... MINCA \" (Cl. Memorial*  \u00b6 *1) on the basis of the cancellation of the copper concessions, it is barred under Article XII(3)(d) from asserting a claim based on such cancellation as of 8 March 2005. Nonetheless, Vannessa first articulated a claim based on the cancellation of the copper concessions in its Memorial dated 13 January 2006 - ten months after the deadline imposed by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.*\n\n*As the Republic first noted in its correspondence of 7 October 2005, Vannessa\u2019s Request for Arbitration (dated 8 July 2004), failed to articulate a claim of treaty breach based on the cancellation of the copper concessions. Neither Vannessa\u2019s list of alleged breaches of the BIT (paragraphs 91-100), nor its list of remedies requested (paragraphs 101-02) mentions the cancellation of MINCA \u2019s copper concessions as the basis for a claim under the BIT. Vannessa\u2019s subsequent attempts to expand the scope of this arbitration to include claims regarding the cancellation of the copper concessions are out of time; in accordance with the BIT, such claims cannot be considered by this Tribunal.*\n\n*For the foregoing reasons, the Republic submits that the present dispute is not within the competence of the Tribunal and requests that this arbitration be dismissed accordingly.*\n\n[49].\n\nThe Respondent therefore raised four objections, namely\n\n- the Acquisition Exception, i.e., that the Republic had decided not to permit the acquisition of the MINCA shares by the Claimant;\n\n- the Venezuelan Law Issue, i.e., that the Claimant never acquired any rights to Las Cristinas or did so in a manner contrary to the Republic\u2019s laws;\n\n- the Waiver Issue, i.e., that the Claimant had not in a definite fashion waived its right to initiate or continue proceedings in the courts of Venezuela in relation to the subject matter of this dispute; and\n\n- the Copper Concessions Claim, i.e., that the Claimant had not in a timely fashion commenced arbitration with respect to the Copper Concessions.\n\n[50].\n\nThese objections were further developed in the two Submissions of the Respondent of 28 August 2006 and 16 February 2007 and answered by the Claimant in its Submissions of 15 December 2006 and 16 April 2007.\n\n[51].\n\nAlthough the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is presently not in a position to decide the second issue which it therefore joins to the merits, it is in a position to decide the three other defenses raised by the Respondent regarding the competence of this Tribunal. It will therefore in the following paragraphs explain it decision regarding the arguments of the Parties to the extent that this is needed.\n\n3.2. Acquisition Exception\n--------------------------\n\n3.2.1. Introduction\n-------------------\n\n[52].\n\nThe Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (BIT) provides in Article XII:\n\n***Settlement of Disputes between an Investor And the Host Contracting Party***\n\n*1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor or an enterprise owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of or arising out of that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.*\n\n[53].\n\nHowever, the Annex to the BIT provides in 11 (3)(b):\n\n(b) *Decisions by either Contracting Party not to permit establishment of a new business enterprise or acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise by investors or prospective investors shall not be subject to the provisions of Article XII of this Agreement.*\n\n[54].\n\nThe meaning of the word \"Decisions\" is disputed.\n\n3.2.2. Position of the Respondent\n---------------------------------\n\n[55].\n\nThe Respondent points to a long line of letters and actions taken by CVG objecting to the transfer of the PDV shares commencing immediately after it was informed on 13 July 2001 of the transaction between PDI and the Claimant.\n\n*\u2022 14 July 2001 The CVG states to Placer Dome that the CVG* *\"does not acknowledge or agree with the share sales agreement with the aforementioned company, or any other company.*\n\n*\u2022 16 July 2001 The CVG-appointed directors of MINCA* *refuse to attend a meeting of the MINCA board of directors called at the request of Claimant.*\n\n*\u2022 20 July 2001 The CVG asks Placer Dome to reconsider its* *negotiations \"behind the back\" of the Republic.*\n\n*\u2022 6 August 2001 The CVG, faced with Placer Dome\u2019s* *repudiation and impossibility of accepting Claimant\u2019s acquisition, decides to rescind the Work Contract and gives notice of rescission.*\n\n*\u2022 17 August 2001 Vannessa seizes control of MINCA; the CVG* *representatives reject \"illegitimate transfer by Placer Dome of shares in Placer Dome Venezuela\" to Claimant and refuse to attend further meetings.*\n\n*\u2022 29 August 2001 The CVG-appointed directors advise MINCA* *that they will not attend the board meeting on 30 August pursuant to their objection to the transaction.*\n\n*\u2022 26 October 2001 The CVG director attends Special* *Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of MINCA and declares that the CVG does not recognize Vannessa acquisition.*\n\n*\u2022 6 November 2001 The CVG gives final notice of termination of* *the Work Contract.*\n\n*\u2022 16 November 2001 The CVG takes possession of Las Cristinas.*\n\n*\u2022 20 November 2001 The CVG writes the MEM to inform it of the* *CVG\u2019s actions and to reiterate that cancellation of the Work Contract was motivated by Placer Dome\u2019s illegitimate attempt to have Claimant acquire its rights and obligations.*\n\n*\u2022 8 March 2002 The MEM cancels copper concessions* *associated with the project.22*\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction of 28 August 2006, pages 42 and 43.\n\n3.2.3. Position of the Claimant\n-------------------------------\n\n[56].\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent took no actions which could be qualified as \"Decisions\" not to permit the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of the shares of PDV. When terminating the Work Contract with letter of 6 August 200123, Mr. Angel Gomez in his capacity as President of CVG qualified the conduct of PDI stating that the transfer of the MINCA shares constituted violations of the Work Contract, of the Shareholders Agreement of 1997 and of the Extension Agreement of 8 August 2000. However, this letter and the final termination of the Work Contract on 6 November 200124 were measures terminating the investment of the Claimant but not \"Decisions\" by Venezuela *\"not to permit... acquisition of an existing business enterprise ora share of such enterprise by the Canadian investor Vannessa\".*\n\nCD-109.\n\nCD-148.\n\n3.2.4. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n------------------------------\n\n[57].\n\nThe term \"Decision\" is not defined in the BIT, it therefore needs to be interpreted by the Tribunal.\n\n[58].\n\nThe Parties have not drawn the attention of the Tribunal to any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* which might cast some light on the meaning of the term \"Decisions\". Mr. Greenwood of behalf of the Claimant stated that *\"there are no travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of which we are aware. We have asked Venezuela if there are any travaux pr\u00e9paratoires but we have not been given any\"25.*\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, page 208,19-22; see also: Mr. Terry, Transcript, Day 2, page 128,14-25 & 129,1-6.\n\n[59].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is also not aware that the interpretation of the word \"Decisions\" ever gave rise to any dispute between the Contracting Parties involving the procedure provided for in Article XIV of the BIT.\n\n[60].\n\nThe BIT is a treaty between two States and is therefore governed by international public law. With respect to the interpretation of treaties, Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 provides:\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.*\n\n[61].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is not aware of any elements listed from paragraphs 2 through 4 which could be taken into consideration. It bases its analysis therefore only on paragraph 1 taking into account the text, including the preamble and annexes.\n\n[62].\n\nThe Parties have adduced definitions contained in a number of legal and general dictionaries. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Respondent has quoted the definition in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, but from the abridged 6th Edition of 199126. The definition in the 8th Edition of 2004, however, reads as follows:\n\n***Decision,***  *n. 1. A judicial or agency determination after consideration of the facts and the law; esp., a ruling, order, or judgment pronounced by a court when considering or disposing of a case.*\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, page 14, footnote 49.\n\n[63].\n\nIt is obvious from the file that CVG from the beginning did not recognize the transfer of the shares. It is also not contested that CVG took a number of measures demonstrating its opposition to the transfer of the shares, finally culminating in the termination of the Work Contract.\n\n[64].\n\nThe Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the ordinary meaning of the term \"Decision\" necessitates, as indicated in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Edition), a determination in the form of a ruling or an order. Leaving aside the question whether or not CVG would at all have been empowered to render any such ruling or order, it is obvious from the file that it never ruled on the permissibility or lack thereof of the share transfer. What it complained of and acted accordingly was that it considered the behavior of PDI and the Claimant to constitute a breach of the agreements binding PDI to the Las Cristinas Project. It, however, never stated that it did not authorize the transfer of the shares which, after all, were transferred and have remained with the Claimant.\n\n[65].\n\nThe Respondent did not draw the attention of the Arbitral Tribunal to any other measures of an official Venezuelan body which could be characterized to constitute a \"Decision\".\n\n[66].\n\nThe context of the term \"Decision\" in the Treaty and an interpretation in the light of its object and purpose in no way affect this interpretation based on the ordinary meaning to be given to the term \"Decision\".\n\n[67].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore holds that Annex I l(3)(b) of the BIT does not apply and that this defense of the Respondent is denied.\n\n3.3. The Venezuelan Law Issue\n-----------------------------\n\n3.3.1. Introduction\n-------------------\n\n[68].\n\nThis issue deals with two intermingled questions. Firstly, whether the Claimant through the Transaction Agreement (PBV) was legally able to acquire the rights which PDI (indirectly) held in the Las Cristinas project and, secondly, assuming that it was able to acquire these rights, if this acquisition was in conformity with the BIT.\n\n[69].\n\nAccording to Article I(f) of the BIT,\n\n*\"investment\" means any kind of asset owned or controlled by an investor of one Contracting Party either directly or indirectly, including through an investor of a third State, in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter\u2019s laws.*\n\n3.3.2. Position of the Respondent\n---------------------------------\n\n[70].\n\nThe position of the Respondent may be summarized as follows:\n\n- The successive Shareholders Agreements (1991 and 1997) should be considered as creating a joint venture between PDI and CVG;\n\n- Due to the nature of the agreement between the Parties, there are intuitu personae obligations;\n\n- PDV is not a real party to the two Shareholders Agreements, but has to be considered as an investor of PDI;\n\n- The 1991 Shareholders Agreement provides that (Article V. D.);\n\n*[...] the parties cannot assign their rights or delegate their obligations hereunder without the other party\u2019s prior consent [...].*\n\n- PDI sold its affiliated company PDV to the Claimant in breach of the above quoted provisions;\n\n- Article 9 of the MINCA Bylaws states that:\n\n*\"Stockholders shall have a preferential right to acquire the shares which other Stockholders wish to sell [...].*\n\n*Any transfer made in violation of this Article shall be void and without any effect upon the company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of shares to related companies wholly-owned by Shareholders, directly or indirectly, or by the Shareholders \u2019parent company are hereby authorized.[...]*\n\n- By selling PDV to the Claimant, PDI also breached Article 9 of the MINCA Bylaws;\n\n- The breach of the Shareholders Agreements and of the MINCA Bylaws rendered the assignment of the shares to Vannessa null and void and the Claimant therefore never acquired property of the MINCA shares;\n\n- Furthermore, as a result of said breaches, the Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the BIT as the investment was not made in accordance with... the laws of Venezuela insofar as a violation of a contract is ipso facto a violation of Venezuelan law pursuant to Article 1159 of the Venezuelan Civil Code, which provides that \"Contracts shall have the force of Law between the Parties\";\n\n- In addition, the Claimant did not make the investment in good faith. For this reason also, no investment in accordance with the law of Venezuela, embodying the principle of good faith occurred;\n\n- The Respondent furthermore considers that the investment, if an investment was ever made, was achieved in bad faith, which would also constitute a violation of international public law and would therefore deny jurisdiction for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide any alleged claims of the Claimant arising from the alleged breach of the BIT.\n\n3.3.3. Position of the Claimant\n-------------------------------\n\n[71].\n\n- The Claimant respected all the formalities imposed by Venezuelan law with regard to the transfer of the shares of PDV;\n\n- PDI did not breach the Shareholders Agreements as neither Article 10.01 of the 1997 version nor Article V.D. of the 1991 version restricted PDI\u2019s ability to sell its shares in its subsidiaries to a third party;\n\n- PDI did not breach Article 9 of the MINCA Bylaws. This Article only provided a right of first refusal relating to the sale of MINCA shares, but contained no requirement with respect to the sale of PDV shares;\n\n- Even if a breach of the above-mentioned provisions would have occurred, said breach cannot be considered to constitute a violation of Venezuelan law;\n\n- No intuitu personae obligations on PDI existed, which could have prevented the transfer of shares to the Claimant;\n\n- A transfer of shares could only be deemed to be null and void ab initio under Venezuelan law if it violated an express rule of law, which was not the case. Moreover, a contract must be considered as valid until a court declares its nullity.\n\n3.3.4. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n------------------------------\n\n[72].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that the main defense of the Respondent, namely that the transfer of the PDV shares constituted a breach of the Shareholders Agreements and of the MINCA By-Laws and therefore rendered this transfer null and void with the result that the Claimant never acquired property in the MINCA shares is likely to constitute a defense on the merits of the case. At the same time, the Respondent alleges as a jurisdictional objection that this transfer was unlawful under Venezuelan law within the meaning of the BIT according to which the investment must be *\"in accordance with the laws of Venezuela\".*\n\n[73].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has received a great number of expert opinions on questions of Venezuelan law, but it has not had the benefit of the examination of such experts by the Parties, nor have the members of the Arbitral Tribunal been able to put questions to the experts.\n\n[74].\n\nBased on the record presently before it, the Arbitral Tribunal therefore does not consider itself to be in a position to determine in a final way at the present time whether or not the MINCA shares are owned or controlled by the Claimant in accordance with Venezuelan law as is required for this Arbitral Tribunal to have jurisdiction (Article 1(f) BIT).\n\n[75].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has considered whether it would therefore be more rational from a procedural viewpoint to re-open the procedure on jurisdiction and ask for further filings and an oral hearing with examination of experts. The Tribunal, however, is conscious of the fact that the possible breach by the original investor PDI of agreements with CVG is an element that might be relevant for the jurisdictional issue, but might also have consequences on the merits. On balance, the Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that justice is better served if this objection to the competence of the Tribunal is joined to the merits and that new timelimits be fixed for the further procedures (ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rule 45(5)).\n\n3.4. The Waiver Issue\n---------------------\n\n3.4.1. Introduction\n-------------------\n\n[76].\n\nArticle XIl(3)(b) of the BIT states that an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration under the BIT *only if*\n\n*the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind.*\n\n[77].\n\nArticle XI 1(12)(a) of the BIT further confirms that the waiver must be made not only by the investor, but also by any enterprise in which the investor has invested:\n\n*Where an investor brings a claim under this Article regarding loss or damage suffered by an enterprise the investor directly or indirectly owns or controls, the following provisions shall apply:*\n\n*... (ii) both the investor and the enterprise must give the waiver referred to in subparagraph (3)(b)...*\n\n[78].\n\nIn a letter to the ICSID Secretary-General dated 8 July 2004, filed with the Request for Arbitration, John Morgan, President of Vannessa, stated:\n\n*I, John Morgan, on behalf of Vannessa Ventures Ltd., consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in the Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"Bilateral Investment Treaty\"), and waive the right of Vannessa Ventures Ltd. to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measures of the Government of Venezuela that are alleged to be in breach of the Bilateral Investment Treaty before the courts or tribunals of Venezuela or in a dispute procedure of any kind.*\n\n[79].\n\nVannessa also filed with the Request for Arbitration:\n\n(a) a Resolution of the Vannessa Board of Directors dated 18 June 2004, that stated, among other things:\n\nVannessa *waives its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measures that are alleged to be in breach of the Bilateral Investment Treaty before the courts or tribunals of Venezuela or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;*\n\n(b) a letter to the ICSID Secretary-General dated 8 July 2004 from Marianna Almeida, legal representative of Vannessa Venezuela, declaring, together with the consent to arbitration, that Vannessa Venezuela,\n\n*... renuncio al derecho a iniciar o continuar cualquier otro procedimiento en relaci\u00f3n con las medidas del Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela que se pretende que constituyen incumplimiento del Tratado Bilateral de Inversiones ante las cortes o tribunales de Venezuela o en cualquier otro tipo de procedimiento de arreglo de controversias.*\n\n(c) a letter to the ICSID Secretary General dated 8 July 2004 from Marianna Almeida, legal representative of MINCA, declaring, together with the consent to arbitration, that MINCA,\n\n*... renuncio al derecho a iniciar o continuar cualquier otro procedimiento en relaci\u00f3n con las medidas del Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela que se pretende que constituyen incumplimiento del Tratado Bilateral de Inversiones ante las cortes o tribunales de Venezuela o en cualquier otro tipo de procedimiento de arreglo de controversias.*\n\n[80].\n\nAccording to the Claimant,\n\n*The filing by Vannessa of these waivers with the Request for Arbitration fulfilled the requirements of Articles XII(3)(b) (the requirement that the investor (Vannessa) file the waiver) and Article XII(12)(a)(ii) (the requirement that the investments (Vannessa Venezuela and MINCA) file the waiver).*\n\n3.4.2. Position of the Respondent\n---------------------------------\n\n[81].\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the purpose of the waiver requirement is to ensure that the Claimant as well as the companies affiliated to the Claimant should not later on, possibly after the close of the investment dispute, be in a position to commence actions against the State arising from claims which were the object of the BIT procedure. The Respondent states that the Claimant had a choice in its form of withdrawal from Venezuelan court proceedings, namely either withdrawal with prejudice or withdrawal without prejudice. According to the Venezuelan Civil Procedure Code, the act by which a party withdraws from a case is termed *\"desistimiento\",* which can be effected in one of two ways: (a) withdrawal with prejudice to future suits *{\"desistimiento de la demanda\")* or (b) withdrawal without prejudice to future suits *{\"desistimiento del procedimiento\")'.*\n\n*There are critical differences between these two methods of withdrawal. Withdrawal with prejudice (\"disistimiento de la demanda\") forecloses a given claimant from filing suit again on the same claim or claims. In other words, the claimant does not retain the right to re-initiate its claim in the same forum. As Venezuelan administrative law expert Dr. Gustavo Grau explains,*\n\n*... the object of the withdrawal of Article 263 (withdrawal with prejudice) is the claim itself... the term \"claim\" in this context must be understood as the equivalent of a*  ***cause of action***  *or the*  ***right that is claimed against the other party.***  *In accordance with the provisions of Article 263 of the CCP, the effect on the proceedings of a withdrawal with prejudice is like*  ***res judicata,***  *like that of a ruling handed down by judicial authority, i.e., once approved by the judge, it terminates the suit definitively, without any possibility of a new suit being field by means of an identical claim, with the same parties and the same purpose.*\n\n*On the other hand, if a claimant withdraws without prejudice effecting a \"desistimiento del procedimiento \", that claimant may re-file the same suit on the same claim and retains the right to re-initiate his cause of action in domestic courts. As expert Dr. Grau notes, this type of withdrawal without prejudice refers to \"the possibility that the claimant may limit the scope of its withdrawal to* *simply not continuing with the*  ***proceedings***  *[\"withdrawal without prejudice\"] initiated by its fding of the claim. \" Additionally, Dr. Grau explains that \"the object of the withdrawal stated by the claimant is limited to a*  ***termination of the procedural stage,***  *that is, the claimant has the option of not continuing with the process, without prejudice to the same party re-filing said claim subsequently, after a period of ninety (90) days following approval of the withdrawal.*\n\n*As indicated above, the difference between the two forms of withdrawal is significant because depending on which of the two forms the claimant chooses, the outcome will be substantially different. Dr. Grau notes,*\n\n*... this distinction, far from being a merely dogmatic or trivial, represents an element of summary importance, in order to be able to determine the consequences of each type of withdrawal, and specifically to determine whether a claimant may bring the same claim against the same counterparty and within the same scope, even after having filed a withdrawal.27*\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction of 28 August 2006, pages 70 and 71.\n\n[82].\n\nThe Respondent furthermore states that the Claimant and its affiliated companies in the various cases pending before Venezuelan courts did not immediately withdraw pending actions with the competent court, as on 15 September 2004, one month after the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration, MINCA filed a new claim before the Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court seeking extraordinary review and nullification of a decision of that Court.\n\n[83].\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the purpose of the waiver provisions in the BIT is clear in that a Party cannot circumvent the BIT by alleging that it had waived its right to initiate or continue its right to bring a claim while at the same time preserving its right to re-initiate it at a later date.\n\n3.4.3. Position of the Claimant\n-------------------------------\n\n[84].\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the *desistimiento* was drafted by Hern\u00e1ndez-Breton, the head of the Administrative Law Litigation Department of the Caracas Office of Baker & McKenzie. The Claimant furthermore submitted reports from two Venezuelan experts, Dr. Ram\u00f3n Escovar and Professor Luis Ortiz Alvarez who opine that the *desistimiento* filed was appropriate and that the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s decision definitively prevents Vannessa from re-opening any of its court actions.\n\n[85].\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the form of the *desistimiento* chosen was in order to not be deemed to have waived the rights to the Additional Facility Procedure before ICSID or possible enforcement actions of an award. The action before the Supreme Constitutional Court did not relate to any claim advanced in these ICSID proceedings but only concerned a previous decision on costs which MINCA considered to be wrong.\n\n3.4.4. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n------------------------------\n\n[86].\n\nThis Arbitral Tribunal is confronted with the question as to what might occur in the future if the Claimant or one of its affiliated companies seizes a Venezuelan court. The statements of the experts presented by the Parties come to opposing conclusions.\n\n[87].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has read with attention the Decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of October 28, 2005 where this court of highest instance had held as follows:\n\n*In this regard, the Chamber must note that Article XII (3)(c) of the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Venezuela and the Government of Canada for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed in Caracas on July 1, 1996, and incorporated to our legal system through the corresponding approbatory law (Special O.G. No. 5,207 of 01.20.98) \"an investor may submit a controversy [...] to arbitration according to paragraph (4) if: [...] (b) the investor has waived its right to bring or continue any proceeding regarding the measure that it purports to be a default on this agreement before the courts by the contracting party or in any type ofproceeding for the settlement of disputes. \"*\n\n*Having seen the contents of that rule, this Chamber deems that it cannot be sustained that the revision requested is in no way related to the controversy arisen with regard to the exploration, development and exploitation of alluvial and vein gold in the area named Las Cristinas, between the parent company of the plaintiff and the Republic and Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Guayana, because the sentencing to pay court costs that is now being impugned had its origin, precisely, on a request for formalization of arbitration regarding the same dispute, but made to our national jurisdiction by way of the Political-Administrative Chamber of this Supreme Court.*\n\n*From this perspective, the Chamber cannot make a thorough examination regarding this review, not assessing the fairness of the monetary sentence against the petitioner, because by having requested the [International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes] to settle the conflict arisen, it undoubtedly waivedfding or continuing any proceeding related- either indirectly or directly -* *to the so-often referred to controversy. For this reason, this Chamber must declare that it dismisses the review requested. So it is decided. \"28*\n\nDecision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, 28 October 2005, V V 321A/7\n\n[88].\n\nIt would therefore seem to this Tribunal that it need not try to analyze the opinions of the experts called upon by the Parties regarding the question of what the difference between the various waivers under Venezuelan procedural law is and whether or not the Claimant and its affiliated companies chose the proper version. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that the waiver prevents Venezuelan courts from deciding claims regarding the Las Cristinas Project. In its Decision, the Supreme Court not only refers to the proceedings pending before it regarding the petition to review a cost decision of a previous judgment, but the Constitutional Chamber went on to state\n\n*... because by having requested the [International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes] to settle the conflict arisen, it undoubtedly waived filing or continuing any proceeding related - either indirectly or directly - to the so-often referred to controversy.*\n\n[89].\n\nIn view of the fact that the question of the scope of the waiver, if this issue should in the future arise, is a matter to be decided under Venezuelan law by the Venezuelan Courts, this Tribunal considers that the Supreme Court of Venezuela is best qualified to interpret Venezuelan law. The Tribunal therefore holds that the waiver fulfils the requirements of the BIT and that this defense of the Respondent is denied.\n\n3.5. Copper Concessions Claim\n-----------------------------\n\n3.5.1. Introduction\n-------------------\n\n[90].\n\nArticle XII, paragraph 2 of the BIT provides:\n\n*If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). For the purposes of this paragraph, a dispute is considered to be initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement,* *and that the investor or an enterprise owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of that breach.*\n\n[91].\n\nArticle XII, paragraph 3 of the BIT provides:\n\n*An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:*\n\n*a....*\n\n*b....*\n\n*c....*\n\n*d. not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.*\n\n[92].\n\nThe question which arises is whether the Claimant when delivering its notice in writing regarding the alleged breach of the BIT with respect to the Copper Concessions held by MINCA did so within the three-year period provided for in Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.\n\n3.5.2. Position of the Respondent\n---------------------------------\n\n[93].\n\nThe Respondent holds that the Copper Concessions Claim was not pleaded prior to the expiry of the statute of limitations contained in the BIT and is therefore time barred. The Respondent considers that when the Claimant submitted the dispute to investor-state arbitration on 8 July 2004, the date on which it presented its Request for Arbitration to ICSID, this Request did not include the Copper Concessions Claim. The date on which the Claimant first became aware of the potential BIT breach was, at the latest, 8 March 2002, but the Claimant first presented its Copper Claim in January 2006 as part of its Memorial, therefore more than three years after 8 March 2002. According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration contained no allegations of a breach of the BIT or a request for relief in relation to the cancellation of MINCA\u2019s Copper Concessions and the references in the Request for Arbitration to the Copper Concessions either fail to constitute any such claim or are so vague that they shed no light on the Claimant\u2019s alleged Copper Claim.\n\n3.5.3 Position of the Claimant\n------------------------------\n\n[94].\n\nAccording to the Claimant, its claim arising from the cancellation of the Copper Concessions is not time-barred:\n\n*The mining of, and contracts and concessions in respect of, gold and copper at Las Cristinas have always been intertwined.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Vannessa makes two claims in this arbitration that involve the copper concessions. The first claim is about Resolution 36 of the Ministry of Energy and Mines dated March 8, 2002, which revoked MINCA\u2019s concession to the Las Cristinas copper concessions. The second claim is about Presidential Chavez\u2019s Decree 1962, published March 12, 2003, that reserved the copper concessions for direct exploitation by the Government of Venezuela. These are the only two claims that Venezuela asserts are time-barred.*\n\n*Vannessa\u2019s first claim about Resolution 36 was clearly pleaded at paragraphs 74,* *88(v), 95 and 102 of the Request for Arbitration. Vannessa sets out these paragraphs at paragraph 212 of its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. Venezuela has never set out any proper basis for concluding that Vannessa\u2019s pleading of this claim in its Request for Arbitration is deficient. The Request for Arbitration setting out this claim was filed on July 9, 2004, less than three years after Resolution 36 was issued on March 8, 2002. This claim is therefore not time-barred.*\n\n*While Vannessa did not make a specific reference to Decree 1962 in its pleadings until it filed its memorial on Merits on January 13, 2006, it amended its Request for Arbitration to include this claim, with the Tribunal\u2019s consent, effective February 28, 2006. This claim was pleaded in both the Memorial and the Request for Arbitration less than three years after Presidential Decree 1962 was published on March 12, 2003. This claim too is therefore not time-barred.29*\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction of 16 April 2007, pages 81 and 82.\n\n3.5.4 The Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n-----------------------------\n\n[95].\n\nOn 8 March 2002, the Ministry of Energy and Mines issued Resolution 3630 declaring MINCA\u2019s concession to the Las Cristinas Copper Concessions expired.\n\nCD-167.\n\n[96].\n\nFor the Arbitral Tribunal, only this date is relevant regarding the commencement of the statute of limitation period. The Presidential Decree of President Chavez of 10 September 2002 published on 12 March 2003 reserving the Copper Concessions for direct exploitation by the Government of Venezuela is of no relevance in this context as already the previous Resolution of 8 March 2002 of the Ministry of Energy and Resources had deprived MINCA of any right to exploit the Copper Concessions which CVG had transferred to it on 28 January 1999.\n\n[97].\n\nThe relevant document regarding the interruption of the statute of limitation is therefore the Request for Arbitration filed on 8 July 2004.\n\n[98].\n\nAccording to Article XII, paragraph 2 of the BIT in order to initiate the dispute the Investor must deliver a\n\n*notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor or an enterprise owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of that breach.*\n\n[99].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that the purpose of such a statute of limitation provision is to require diligent prosecution of known claims and insuring that claims will be resolved when evidence is reasonably available and fresh, therefore to protect the potential debtor from late actions.\n\n[100].\n\nThe Tribunal keeps in mind that this dispute between the Parties mainly concerns the gold mining rights which had been granted to MINCA with the Work Contract in 1992, whereas the copper rights were only granted in 1999 and that little, if any, mining activity regarding copper exploitation is recorded. As long as the Respondent was given notice with the filing of the Request for Arbitration that its claims under the BIT not only concerned the gold mining rights but that the alleged treatment by the Respondent regarding the MINCA Copper Concessions also constituted a subject matter of this dispute, the purpose of the prescription provision is fulfilled.\n\n[101].\n\nIn this context, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that in paragraph 13 of the Request for Arbitration, the Las Cristinas Project is described as *\"a gold and copper mining project\".* In paragraph 74, the Claimant states (i) *\"in cancelling the copper concessions, the Ministry did not follow the administrative procedures with which it was required to comply under Venezuelan law\".*\n\n[102].\n\nIn paragraph 88, the Claimant recited the written notice of breaches of the BIT which on 5 June 2002 was given to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Venezuela in accordance with Article XII(2) of the BIT. In this list, it mentioned under (v) *\"the expropriation of MINCA\u2019s mining rights in Las Cristinas through resolutions of the Ministry of Energy and Mines in March 2002 reassuming the rights to Las Cristinas and*  *canceling the Las Cristinas copper concessions held by MINCA* *.\"* (Emphasis added).\n\n[103].\n\nIn the Chapter of the Request for Arbitration dealing with the breaches of the BIT, in paragraph 91, the Claimant in a general way refers to the alleged expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s investments in the Las Cristinas project and the lack of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security with respect to MINCA and in paragraph 95, reference is made to *\"the actions taken by the Ministry of Energy and Mines\".*\n\n[104].\n\nFrom an objective viewpoint, the Request for Arbitration must be understood to have included the alleged violations of MINCA\u2019s rights (and therefore of the Claimant) relating to the Copper Concessions and the Respondent was therefore, upon receipt of the Request, aware of the fact that the dispute also concerned the termination of the Copper Concessions.\n\n[105].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore holds that the Copper Concessions Claim is not time-barred and that this defense of the Respondent is denied.\n\n[106].\n\nNOW THEREFORE,\n\nTHE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL DECIDES AS FOLLOWS :\n\na) The defense raised by the Respondent that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimant has never acquired any right to the Las Cristinas or did so in a manner not in accordance with the laws of Venezuela, as required by Article 1(f) of the applicable bilateral investment treaty, is joined to the merits.\n\nb) The other three objections to jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal are denied.\n\nc) The allocation of the costs of this phase of the proceeding is reserved for later.\n\nd) The Arbitral Tribunal, after consultation with the Parties, will issue an Order for the further procedure."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2013-01-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| Additional Facility Rules | Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in effect from January 1, 2003 |\n| Arbitration Rules | Schedule C to the Additional Facility Rules (as defined above)\u2014Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules |\n| Canada-Venezuela BIT or the BIT or the Treaty | The Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated July 1, 1996, which entered into force on January 28, 1998 |\n| Claimant or Vannessa | Vannessa Ventures Ltd. |\n| Claimant\u2019s Memorial | Memorial on the Merits of Vannessa Ventures Ltd., January 13, 2006 |\n| Claimant\u2019s Reply | Reply on the Merits of Vannessa Ventures Ltd., August 21, 2009 |\n| Copper Concessions | Concessions for the exploitation of copper on the Las Cristinas sites issued in 1996 |\n| CVG | Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Guayana. |\n| Decision on Jurisdiction | Decision on Jurisdiction of August 22, 2008 |\n| Ex.

(the **\"Claimant\"** or **\"Vannessa\")** for arbitration against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the **\"Respondent\"** or **\"Venezuela\")** (jointly, the **\"Parties\")** under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (Additional Facility Rules) in effect as of January 1, 2003 (the **\"Additional Facility Rules\").** The proceeding was brought under the Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated July 1, 1996 (the **\"Canada-Venezuela BIT\"** or the **\"BIT\"** or the **\"Treaty\"),** which entered into force on January 28, 1998.\n\n2.\n\nBy letters dated August 23, 2004, and September 15, 2004, Claimant supplemented its Request for Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nOn October 28, 2004, the Secretary-General of ICSID approved Claimant\u2019s access to the Additional Facility in accordance with Article 4 of the Additional Facility Rules. On the same day, the Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 4 of Schedule C to the Additional Facility Rules\u2014the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (the **\"Arbitration Rules\")\u2014** and pursuant to Article 5 of the Arbitration Rules invited the Parties to constitute an arbitral tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nNo agreement was reached between the Parties on the constitution of the tribunal. Accordingly, Claimant invoked Article 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules according to which the tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators\u2014one appointed by each party, and the third, the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated January 26, 2005, Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator. On February 15, 2005, Respondent appointed Mr Jan Paulsson, at that time, a national of France, as arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nOn May 20, 2005, the Parties informed the Centre that they had jointly appointed Mr V.V. Veeder, a national of the United Kingdom, as the third and presiding arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 7, 2005, the ICSID Secretary-General notified the Parties and the arbitrators that the Tribunal had been constituted and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that date in accordance with Article 13(1) of the Arbitration Rules. On the same date, the Parties were informed that Mr Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rivas, ICSID Counsel, had been appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nOn July 29, 2005, the Tribunal held its First Session with the Parties in London, U.K. The following individuals were present at the First Session:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\nMr V.V.

This timetable was later amended on several occasions in accordance with the Parties\u2019 requests. It was also confirmed that Additional Facility Arbitration Rules in effect from January 1, 2003 were applicable to the proceeding.\n\n10.\n\nOn December 23, 2005, the Centre informed the Tribunal and the Parties that Mr Martin M. Serrano, ICSID Counsel, had been appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal in replacement of Mr Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rivas.\n\n11.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, Claimant submitted its Memorial.\n\n12.\n\nOn February 28, 2006, Claimant submitted an amendment to its Request for Arbitration. By letter dated March 3, 2006, Respondent stated its opposition to Claimant\u2019s request to introduce an amendment. After considering the Parties\u2019 observations on the matter, the Tribunal decided on March 15, 2006, pursuant to Articles 47 and 35 of the Arbitration Rules, to grant Claimant\u2019s request and to introduce the amendment as an ancillary claim and to treat it as having been made and pleaded on February 28, 2006.\n\n13.\n\nOn April 4, 2006, the Centre informed the Tribunal and the Parties that Ms Claudia Frutos-Peterson, ICSID Counsel, had been appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal in replacement of Mr Martin M. Serrano.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 5, 2006, Respondent raised objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and requested a suspension of the proceedings in accordance with Article 45(4) of the Arbitration Rules.

Placer Dome wrote as follows:\n\nIn regards to the position of chairman, we have been guided by our understanding that CVG chose Placer Dome as the majority partner for its proven technical and commercial capacity to develop large-scale mines and not as a provider of technical services under contract, or as a simple technical adviser. If this is the case, it seems logical and normal that Placer Dome would take on the majority of the operational decisions. In January we agreed that CVG would appoint the Director of Human Resources, the Controller and the Secretary, but we reserved the right to appoint the general manager, the primary finance officer and the mine manager. We assume that CVG would like to appoint the chairman, although the operational authority of this position is, to a certain extent, only a formality, because for the joint company public relations and lobbying will be of great importance, and we believe that these tasks could be best carried out by a Venezuelan appointed by CVG.9\n\nThere is no suggestion or indication that CVG disagreed with this view.\n\nEx.

In the case of REMINCA, 51% of the shares would be subscribed by PDV and 49% by CVG.

The Copper Concessions were subject to detailed conditions in respect of matters such as reporting to the MEM, the training of Venezuelan personnel, the improvement of the physical, cultural, social, and economic conditions of the population in the neighbourhood of the concessions, and the protection and renewal of the environment. It was understood that the holding of copper rights in the legal form of copper concessions was necessary in order that Placer Dome could arrange guarantees for loans necessary for the exploitation of Las Cristinas.19 Rights under the Copper Concessions were transferred to CVG in 1996, and then transferred in turn to MINCA20 in 199921\n\nEx.

Accordingly, in 1997, the 1991 Shareholders Agreement was revised in order to increase the financial commitment and shareholding of PDV and decrease that of CVG.\n\n64.\n\nMINCA was reorganized, so that PDV\u2019s share was increased to 95% and CVG\u2019s share was reduced to 5%, though CVG had the option to increase its share up to 30% in the future by making contributions. The reorganization was formalized in the **1997 Amended Shareholders Agreement24** entered into by CVG, PDI, and PDV \"in its capacity as PDI\u2019s investor.\"25\n\nEx.

At that time the price of gold had fallen to under US$ 300 per ounce.26 The falling gold price affected the profitability of the Las Cristinas project.\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement\" \u00b6\u00b654-58.\n\n68.\n\nSix weeks later, on July 15, 1999, a meeting of the MINCA Board of Directors, which had been called by PDV, resolved to suspend the Las Cristinas project in accordance with the 1997 Shareholders Agreement and the MINCA Bylaws (the **\"MINCA Bylaws\").** The CVG-appointed director voted against the suspension and MEM officials expressed their displeasure at the decision.27 It appears that exploitation of the mine never in fact began.\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement \u00b6 60.\n\n69.\n\nIn the view of CVG, because the suspension was a unilateral, unauthorized step, CVG had the contractual right to rescind the Work Contract if the suspension continued for more than one year,28 /.29\n\n*See* Ex. C-20A, Clause Nineteenth.\n\n*See* \"Las Cristinas Project. Staged Development Feasibility Study. Volume 4 - General Matters. April 2000,\" prepared by MINCA in collaboration with Placer Dome Technical Services Limited, Ex C-277: p. 4.2, \"The Work Contract allows MINCA to suspend the project for a period of up to 12 months. After such period, CVG can unilaterally rescind the Work Contract.\"\n\n70.\n\nPlacer Dome sought to devise alternative plans, including a \u2018staged development plan\u2019 (the **\"Phoenix Project\"),** for the development of Las Cristinas,30 and discussed the matter with CVG. CVG did not accept the staged development plan. No new plan was agreed.\n\n*See, for example,* Ex. R-10.\n\n71.\n\nPlacer Dome regarded the exploitation of the mine as not economically viable and, according to a Placer Dome press release dated June 14, 2000, decided to suspend the project until technology or market conditions improved. That press release also stated that \"Placer Dome will write off the carrying value of its investment in Las Cristinas, totalling $116 million, and will reclassify the property\u2019s 7.4 million ounces of gold reserves as resources.31\"\n\n*See* Ex. R-15.\n\n72.\n\nMINCA sought the agreement of CVG to the extension of the suspension for a further year, and CVG gave its agreement. An Extension Agreement was concluded by CVG,\n\nPDI, PDV, and MINCA on August 8, 2000 **(\"Extension Agreement\").32** Under the Extension Agreement, the property would be maintained and the social programs in the Guyana region undertaken, and the Las Cristinas project would continue; however, the mining project would be suspended until July 14, 2001.33 CVG considered that, under this agreement, it would again be entitled to exercise its right to cancel the Work Contract on July 15, 2001, because of the earlier unauthorised suspension.34\n\nEx.

The process was not smooth. In November 2000, Scotia submitted a list of 28 possible investors (Vannessa\u2019s name was not on that list).35 PDV considered that CVG was failing to cooperate in this effort.36 CVG considered that Scotia was insisting upon the offering of incentives to investors that were beyond CVG\u2019s powers to offer and that were, in CVG\u2019s opinion, unnecessary to attract an investor.37 Scotia suspended its activities on March 18, 2001, and its contract was cancelled on May 18, 2001.38\n\nSecond Patines Witness Statement \u00b6 24.\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement \u00b6\u00b6 69-73.\n\nSecond Patines Witness Statement \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 32.\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement \u00b6 73.\n\n74.\n\nSubsequent events need to be read against the background of Article 9 of the MINCA Bylaws, which established a right of pre-emption in the event that one of the shareholders wished to sell all or part of its shareholding in MINCA. It provided that:\n\n[...] The Shareholders shall have a preferential right to purchase the shares that other Shareholders wish to sell for a consideration, in the proportion which the number of shares held by each shareholder at the time the sale offer is known bears to the total number of shares of the Company. For these purposes, the selling Shareholder shall send a letter to the Board of Directors of the Company informing it of the number of shares it wishes to sell, the name of the intended buyer and the purchase price. The Board of Directors shall give immediate notice of the offer to the other Shareholders, who shall have a term of thirty (30) calendar days to exercise their preferential right.\n\nIf the other Shareholders do not exercise their preferential right, or exercise it partially, the selling Shareholder may sell the remaining shares for a price no lower than the price informed to the Board of Directors.\n\nAny transfer made in violation of this Clause shall be deemed to be void and without any effect upon the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of shares to related companies, wholly-owned by Shareholders, directly or indirectly, or by the Shareholder\u2019s parent Company are hereby authorized.39\n\nEx. C-6A.\n\n75.\n\nThe need to bring a new investor into MINCA remained. Mr Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pinedo, the in-house counsel for PDV at the time and now Vice-President, General Counsel, and Secretary of Placer Dome America, testified that:\n\nPlacer Dome decided that while it still wanted to retain an interest in Las Cristinas and maintain the possibility of re-entering the project at some future date, it could no longer feasibly develop the project on its own in Venezuela.\n\nPlacer Dome decided that it would seek an investor to purchase its shares in Placer Dome Venezuela while still retaining back-in and royalty rights to the [Las Cristinas] project.40\n\nBefore entering into negotiations with any third party, Placer Dome offered to sell its interest in Las Cristinas to CVG...41\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement \u00b6 74.\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement \u00b6 75.\n\n76.\n\nOn April 17, 2001, William Hayes [sic then Placer Dome\u2019s Executive Vice President - United States & Latin America] attended a meeting with the president of CVG, General Rangel Gomez, to propose the sale.42\n\n*Id.*\n\n77.\n\nOne week later, on April 25, 2001, Mr Hayes wrote to the President of CVG as follows:\n\n[... ] I would like to confirm the interest of Placer Dome (Placer) in exploring the possibility of an agreement with the Corporation that you preside (CVG) to transfer to CVG the economic interest of Placer in MINCA.-\n\nAs a preliminary step, we have anticipated a viable alternative to facilitate a transition of the Project in the form of a sale or transfer of the economic interest of Placer in MINCA to CVG, so that CVG would become the sole owner of MINCA.-\n\nPlacer has thought that the sale of the economic interest could be for a determined amount which would be paid in deferred payments with the income from the Project, if it is indeed developed by CVG, on its own, in combination with third parties, by third parties related to it, or completely on its own. The calculation and payment of said amount would be on the basis of a percentage of the income from the Project, the value of the mineral extracted, or a similar formula. To this end, Placer proposes that it be paid 5% of the income from the sale of the Project mineral, in quarterly payments.-\n\nIt is very important that, in the event that this proposal should prove feasible, and once both parties have defined the proposal in all its conditions (including the approval by the respective corporate entities of CVG and Placer), it be executed before July 15, 2001, the date on which the suspension period of the Project expires. Beyond this date, Placer cannot continue to cover the cost of infrastructure, facilities and social programs of the Project. -\n\nIn order for it to be completed within the desired time period this proposal requires joint, full time, diligent and sustained work by the negotiation teams of the parties. The Project involves many legal aspects and businesses that need to be taken into consideration in order to resolve the aforementioned proposal. Therefore, if CVG is interested in pursuing conversation on the proposal, we think that the best way to do so is to immediately designate the negotiation teams and instruct them on the need to give priority to the discussion on this subject in order to close it on the date that we spoke of, next May 31.-\n\nPlacer is at the disposal of CVG to initiate the negotiation of this alternative. The aforementioned notwithstanding, Placer would like to leave other Project negotiation options open until such a time as this operation is concluded.-\n\nAs we have stated, Placer believes that current conditions do not allow the development of the Project as it was conceived and, as you know, MINCA contacted Scotia Capital in search of alternatives for developing the Project, but the results of this search were negative. However, these conditions could change in the future. Therefore, Placer wants to offer the possibility that if no mining project is developed in Las Cristinas after a certain period of time past the date of the Placer interest in MINCA to CVG, Placer could reacquire this interest for the same price as was negotiated with CVG.43\n\nEx. C-74A.\n\n78.\n\nCVG was interested in considering Placer Dome\u2019s proposal. On May 14, 2001, CVG replied to Placer Dome, stating that it would create a team to evaluate the offer.44 There is no evidence that a sale price or other precise terms of sale were at any time proposed by Placer Dome to CVG. On June 7, 2001, Placer Dome wrote again to CVG, noting that the extended suspension would soon expire (on July 15, 2001) and proposing a meeting in Venezuela on June 14 or 15, 2001, to discuss the matter45\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement \u00b6 75.\n\nEx. C-76A.\n\n79.\n\nOn July 11, 2001, the president of CVG wrote to the Minister at the MEM to make it aware of the situation with MINCA. He observed that Placer Dome had a 70% stock participation in MINCA, and that CVG had 30%. He noted that: (i) CVG had invested US$ 110 million in the project; (ii) Placer Dome had notified CVG of its intention not to continue with the project (including the cost of the electric transmission lines); and (iii) CVG and the MEM had held meetings in search of an institutional consensus on ways to preserve and reactivate the project. He noted the imminent expiry of the extended deadline, which would occur on July 15, and said that \"we find ourselves in urgent need of continuing the execution of the Las Cristinas Mining project through the company MINCA, assuming total stock control of said company.\"46\n\nEx.

Mr Patines testified that the purpose of the meeting was to inform Placer Dome of CVG\u2019s decision to consider Placer Dome\u2019s proposal. He said that he was \"astonished\" when he \"heard Mr Pinedo\u2019s news, that Placer Dome was about to sign an agreement with a third party,\" and that he was unaware that Placer Dome was negotiating with a third party.47\n\nSecond Patines Witness Statement \u2018 \u00b635.\n\n81.\n\nMr Pinedo testified that a Scotia representative had suggested that a deal with Vannessa might be possible, that Vannessa had contacted Placer Dome with a potential offer in April 2001, and that Placer Dome and Vannessa had met that month in New York. He wrote that:\n\nWe met for the entire day and by the end of the meeting we had worked out the essential elements of a deal for Placer Dome to transfer its shares in Placer Dome de Venezuela to Vannessa. Placer Dome understood that once the deal was in place Vannessa would begin work on the Las Cristinas Project immediately through a $50 million staged development plan. Vannessa had a workable plan that could be implemented immediately.... Placer Dome had confidence in Vannessa because Placer Dome had entered into a deal with it in the past for a mine in Costa Rica....\n\nDuring this negotiation period, Placer Dome maintained its offer with the CVG. Placer Dome told Vannessa that until a deal was finalized between Placer Dome and Vannessa, the CVG retained its option to accept Placer Dome\u2019s offer. Placer Dome told the CVG that it was considering offers from third parties and, as a result, the CVG should act upon its offer quickly. But it did not specifically advise the CVG of its negotiations with Vannessa and was not required to do so under any of its agreements with the CVG.48\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\n82.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record of any detailed technical or financial presentation made by Vannessa to Placer Dome before July 2001. Indeed, there is no document in evidence that records Vannessa\u2019s detailed technical or financial plans for the Las Cristinas project at all. Questioned by the Tribunal, counsel for Claimant was unable to identify any such presentation or plans.\n\n83.\n\nThe only document in evidence that indicates even the possibility of financial backing for Vannessa is a letter dated May 25, 2001, from Mr L. B. Gordon, President of Coril Holdings Ltd, a Canadian global investment and management company, which had received assets worth in excess of $2 billion in 1998 and 1999.49 The letter, which contains no firm undertaking to finance Vannessa, read as follows:\n\nTo Project Owner Dear Sirs,\n\nRe: Vannessa Ventures Ltd (Vannessa)\n\nCoril Holdings Ltd (\"Cord\") is interested in providing financing to Vannessa regarding the development projects of Vannessa ranging from US$ 15 million and higher, in accordance with a feasibility study acceptable to Coril and on terms satisfactory to Coril.\n\nCoril, through predecessor subsidiary companies, has a lengthy and successful history in the mining industry in North America and has the experience and financial capacity to invest in mining development projects.\n\nCoril is a major shareholder of Vannessa and as such is very interested in providing support to Vannessa in its initiatives to develop resources.

VIII, Section 8.19\n\n89.\n\nThe broad aim of the Original Transaction Agreement appears to have been that PDI would transfer its responsibilities in respect of Las Cristinas to Vannessa, but retain a right to resume its participation in the project or to share in any profits from the Project or to share in any damages resulting from the present case or similar litigation.\n\n90.\n\nOn the same day, July 13, 2001, Placer Dome informed CVG of the transaction with Vannessa by fax.58 Again on July 13, 2001, Vannessa Ventures Ltd. wrote to the MEM. Vannessa\u2019s letter read as follows:\n\nMr Alvaro Silva Calderon\n\nMinister of Energy and Mines,\n\nHis Office.\n\nGreetings from the company directors.\n\nWe hereby wish to introduce ourselves. We are a Canadian public company, with investments in Venezuela since 1993, and we are very pleased to expand our interests in the country through the purchase of the Placer Dome de Venezuela company by Vannessa Ventures.\n\nWe made this purchase for the purpose of developing the Las Cristinas project, and make it profitable, sustained and sustainable in time, adapting ourselves to the disadvantages of the current economy.\n\nOur company has not been heavily promoted in the country. However, we have the necessary technical and financial capability, in addition to the corporate mentality, to develop the project and reach the required levels. We are sure that you will be satisfied with our achievement of the social and economic interests in the region.\n\nAlthough Vannessa Ventures is a young company, our directors have more than thirty (30) years experience in \u2018large scale\u2019 mining in several countries around the world.\n\nWe would like to set up, through this channel, a meeting with you and some of your directors,59 in order to present our company, and acquaint you with our work plans.\n\nWe are sure that we can rely on your support to achieve the proposed goals and benefits.\n\nSincerely\n\n[Sgd]60\n\nFirst Pinedo Witness Statement\" \u00b6\u00b683-85.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the English translation provided by Respondent of Ex.

Therefore, this part should be translated as \"our directors.\"\n\nEx. R-145.\n\n91.\n\nA slightly more detailed account appeared on Canada Newswire on the same day:\n\nPlacer Dome Inc. is pleased to announce that its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Placer B-V Limited (PBV), has entered into an agreement to sell all of the shares of Placer Dome de Venezuela C.A. (PDV) to a subsidiary of Vannessa Ventures Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada. PDV holds a majority interest in Mineras Las Cristinas (MINCA), the corporation formed to develop the Las Cristinas property in Bolivar State, Venezuela.\n\nPBV will retain an interest in the gold and copper revenues generated by the Las Cristinas property and will, under certain circumstances, have the right to re-acquire the shares. If PBV re-acquires the shares, Vannessa will be entitled to an interest in the gold and copper revenues. MINCA suspended construction on Las Cristinas in 1999 due to low metal prices and Placer Dome wrote off the carrying value of its investment in mid-2000.61\n\nEx.

The letter read as follows:\n\nI respectfully write to you in order to notify you that, in addition to the content of the correspondence sent this past Friday, in which we state our decision to develop the mining concession Las Cristinas, Kilometer 88, State of Bolivar. I would also like to apologize for the delay in making you aware of our existence and intention vis-\u00e0-vis the project of the aforementioned mining concession. The delay in signing the negotiation between our parent company Vannessa Ventures Ltd., and the selling company Placer Dome, which was totally out of our control, prevented us from any public statement.\n\nTherefore, we are asking for a vote of confidence toward our company and offer the assurance of our wish for a peaceful and prosperous coexistence between Vannessa Ventures Ltd. and the national community at large.\n\n[Sgd]\n\nErich Rauguth.62\n\nEx.

IHC] Corp., the latter a subsidiary of Vannessa Ventures Ltd. I would like to inform you that the Venezuelan Guyana Corporation does not acknowledge or agree with the share sales agreement with the aforementioned company, or any other company, that may have taken place in violation of the terms and conditions established in the Modified Shareholders Agreement, the Extension Agreement and the legal norms that regulate the matter and, therefore, the relations in our country of this transnational company could be seriously impaired.63\n\nEx.

C-284A.\n\n97.\n\nLater in July 2001, further agreements were made by Placer Dome and Vannessa to complete the sale of Placer Dome\u2019s interests to Vannessa, and PDV was renamed Vannessa de Venezuela C.A.67\n\nEx.

C-20A, Clause Twenty Eighth.\n\n99.\n\nThere were several exchanges of views between the interested parties, but the dispute was not settled. In one such exchange, Mr Rauguth, writing as President of MINCA, requested arbitration of the dispute under Clause Twenty Sixth of the Work Contract; but that request was not taken up.71 It is not necessary to rehearse those exchanges in detail here.\n\nEx.

In July 2002, CVG considered bids from five companies and, in September 2002, CVG announced that it had reached an agreement with Crystallex, a Canadian company, for the exploitation and development of Las Cristinas.75\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial \u00b6\u00b6180-84.\n\n103.\n\nMINCA, now controlled by Vannessa, brought ten sets of legal proceedings in the Venezuelan courts to protect its rights to Las Cristinas and to nullify the CVG-Crystallex agreement as follows:\n\n(i) a constitutional petition filed on September 11, 2001, to protect MINCA\u2019s property and enforce the arbitration provisions in the work contract. On November 8, 2001, the court held the application inadmissible; and on March 19, 2002, that decision was confirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n(ii) a constitutional petition filed on November 16, 2001, to prevent CVG taking over the Las Cristinas site. On February 19, 2002, the court held that it was the wrong forum; and on April 30, 2002, the second court declined to admit the application.\n\n(iii) a constitutional petition filed on January 18, 2002, challenging MINCA\u2019s termination of the Work Contract and seeking an injunction to prevent CVG disposing of MINCA\u2019s rights. On March 20, 2002, the court held the application inadmissible because it was a contractual and not a constitutional matter. An appeal was rejected on February 26, 2003.\n\n(iv) an action filed on May 3, 2002, with requests for interim relief, seeking nullification of CVG\u2019s decision to terminate the Work Contract. The case was withdrawn in July 2004, by which time it had proceeded to the evidentiary stage.\n\n(v) an action filed on May 13, 2002, with requests for interim relief, seeking nullification of a MEM decision of March 8, 2002, reassuming rights to the Las Cristinas gold concessions. The case was admitted by the court on July 7, 2004.\n\n(vi) an action filed on May 15, 2002, with requests for interim relief, seeking nullification of the Presidential Decree of April 2002 relating to the gold concessions. The case was admitted on July 17, 2002. On May 11, 2004, the court decided that the case should proceed to the evidentiary stage.\n\n(vii) an action filed on May 30, 2002, seeking to compel CVG to attend arbitration. On July 15, 2004, the court declined to admit the application.\n\n(viii) an action filed on September 26, 2002, with requests for interim relief, seeking nullification of an MEM decision of March 8, 2002, cancelling MINCA\u2019s copper concession. The court had made no decision on admissibility by the time that Vannessa filed its Request for Arbitration on July 9, 2004.\n\n(ix) an action filed on November 14, 2002, seeking to nullify the CVG/Crystallex agreement. The case was admitted by the court on March 27, 2003. An appeal by Crystallex had not been dealt with by the time that Vannessa filed its Request for Arbitration on July 9, 2004.\n\n(x) an action filed on September 11, 2003, seeking nullification of the Presidential Decree of March 2003 relating to the Copper Concessions.76\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 185-200.\n\n104.\n\nBetween December 2001 and 2003, MINCA also made a series of requests to the Venezuelan National Assembly and to the Fiscal\u00eda (Prosecutor\u2019s Office)77 to investigate various aspects of the Las Cristinas matter.78 None led to any report or action that Vannessa regarded as an impartial and satisfactory upholding of its rights.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 22If, 489f. Claimant refers to the \"Fiscal\u00eda\" as the \"Attorney General.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial \u00b6 209-30.\n\n105.\n\nOn July 9, 2004, Vannessa filed its Request for Arbitration. It claimed monetary damages in an amount not less than US$ 1,045,000.000 plus compound interest.79\n\nRequest for Arbitration \u00b6 102.\n\n106.\n\nIn paragraph 344 of its Memorial, Claimant requested:\n\n(a) a declaration that Venezuela had unlawfully expropriated Vannessa\u2019s investments in Venezuela contrary to Article VII of the BIT;\n\n(b) a declaration that Venezuela had failed to accord investments of Venezuela [sic. sc. of Vannessa] fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security contrary to Article II(2) of the BIT;\n\n(c) restitution of its unlawfully expropriated investments as well as monetary damages for deterioration or loss of those assets, for lost profits caused by delay of the development of Las Cristinas, and for expenses incurred by MINCA, Vannessa Venezuela and Vannessa to defend their rights and interests, plus compound interest;\n\n(d) in lieu of restitution, monetary damages in an amount to be determined plus compound interest;\n\n(e) all of its costs, including tribunal costs, in bringing these proceedings; and\n\n(f) such further and other relief that Vannessa may claim and the Tribunal grant.\n\n107.\n\nSimilarly, in paragraph 639 of its Reply, Claimant reiterated\n\n[... ] its requests for relief set out at paragraph 344 of its Memorial, including its request for restitution of MINCA\u2019s right to mine gold and copper at Las Cristinas, or, in lieu of restitution, an award equal to its past and future losses as at the date of the Tribunal\u2019s award, calculated by reference to current information, for the damages caused by Venezuela\u2019s breaches of the Bilateral Investment Treaty described in this Reply. Vannessa also claims all of its costs, including Tribunal costs, in bringing these proceedings.\n\n108.\n\nIn paragraph 588 of its Counter-Memorial, Respondent requested that \"Claimant\u2019s claims should be dismissed in their entirety and Venezuela should be awarded compensation for all the expenses and costs associated with defending against these claims.\" The same request was made in paragraph 1013 of Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n**I. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n109.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal (then differently constituted):\n\n[N]ote[d] that the main defense of the Respondent, namely that the transfer of the PDV shares constituted a breach of the Shareholders Agreement of the MINCA By-Laws and therefore rendered the transfer null and void with the result that the Claimant never acquired property in the MINCA shares is likely to constitute a defense on the merits of the case. At the same time, the Respondent alleges as a jurisdictional objection that this transfer was unlawful under Venezuelan law within the meaning of the BIT according to which the investment must be *\"in accordance with the laws of Venezuela.\"80*\n\nFor convenience, we refer to the requirement set out in the italicized words as the \"legality requirement.\" The requirement derives from Article I(f) of the BIT, which stipulates that:\n\n\u2018[I]nvestment\u2019 means any kind of asset owned or controlled by an investor of one Contracting Party either directly or indirectly, including through an investor of a third State, in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter\u2019s laws.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, p. 22.\n\n110.\n\nIn light of the complexity of the issues of Venezuelan law involved and the possible relevance of Venezuelan law to both jurisdictional and merits questions, the Tribunal concluded in its Decision on Jurisdiction that \"justice is better served if this objection to the competence of the Tribunal is joined to the merits.\"81\n\n7ri.,p. 23.\n\n111.\n\nThe present Tribunal has considered the position in light of the law applicable to each of the instruments relevant to its decision. The Tribunal is satisfied that it is the law of Venezuela that is the governing law of the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, of the Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, of the Work Contract and of the Extension Agreement, as well as of the MINCA By-Laws. It was not argued that any other legal system operated as the governing law in respect of these instruments. The BIT is governed by public international law.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal is unanimous in deciding that Claimant\u2019s claims are to be rejected in their entirety. As is explained below, the Tribunal finds that Placer Dome\u2019s sale and Claimant\u2019s acquisition of its interest in MINCA was incompatible with the legal relationship between PDI and Venezuela, reflected in the Shareholders\u2019 Agreements of 1991 and 1997, and confirmed by Article 9 of the MINCA Bylaws (set out above.).82 The termination of the Work Contract and the taking of the associated steps to terminate PDI\u2019s interests in Las Cristinas were measures justified by PDFs breach of its agreements with CVG, from which Claimant\u2019s legal interests in this case derived, and in particular from PDFs breach of the Extension Agreement. None of the steps taken by Venezuela amounted to a breach of the BIT.\n\n*See* \u00b6 74 above.\n\n113.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is unanimous in holding that Claimant\u2019s claims are to be rejected in their entirety, it is not unanimous in all of the steps in the reasoning that lead to that conclusion. The majority of the Tribunal considers that the Tribunal has jurisdiction in this case and that the claims fail because, on the facts of this case, Respondent\u2019s treatment of the investment does not constitute a breach of the Treaty. One of us considers that, on the facts of this case, there was no good-faith investment and that the BIT does not cover investments not made in good faith, and accordingly the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. The majority accepts that good faith has an important role in the analysis but considers that, in the absence of a treaty provision ascribing some different effect to the principle of good faith, it is only in circumstances where the application of good faith as a principle of national law invalidates the acquisition of the investment that a lack of good faith means that there is no \"investment\" for jurisdictional purposes. In other circumstances, the question of good faith does not go to jurisdiction but is a matter to be considered by the Tribunal when exercising its jurisdiction and to be applied in the context of admissibility and/or the application of the substantive protections of the Treaty at the merits phase.\n\n114.\n\nThese divergences in view are reflected in the following paragraphs. However, all members of the Tribunal have subscribed to this Award, on the basis that the decision on jurisdiction is carried by the majority, and that the member who dissented on the question of jurisdiction considers that, on the premise that jurisdiction exists, Claimant\u2019s claims are to be rejected in their entirety for the reasons that are set out below in the section of the analysis that addresses the merits of this case.\n\n115.\n\nThe analysis begins by addressing the jurisdictional issues. It addresses the question whether there was an investment within the meaning of the BIT, and it does so in two steps, starting with the question whether there was an \"investment\" in \"any asset\", and then moving to the question whether the alleged investment was \"owned or controlled... in accordance with the [host State\u2019s] laws.\" The merits of the claim are considered afterwards.\n\n**A. Definition of \"Investment\" Step One: \"any kind of asset...\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n116.\n\nAt the outset, Respondent considers that the issue of the existence of an \"investment\" has not yet been decided by the Tribunal. It also takes the view that the definition of an \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention can be applied in this particular arbitration. It says that while the Additional Facility Rules differ from the ICSID Convention in important respects (particularly regarding *ratione personae* jurisdiction), the Additional Facility Rules do not bar, and in fact require, the application of the definition of \"investment\" that is applicable under the ICSID Convention. It says that Claimant\u2019s investment does not satisfy the so-called *\"Salini\"* criteria for an investment to exist:83*i.e.,* \"contributions, certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction... [and a] contribution to the economic development of the host State.\"84\n\nRejoinder on Merits and Jurisdiction of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, February 1, 2010 **(\"Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder\") \u00b6\u00b6** 600-50. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 368-80; Tr.

A Commentary,* 2nd ed. (2009), \u00b6\u00b6 152-74.\n\n*2. Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n117.\n\nClaimant argues that the definition of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention is irrelevant for the present arbitration, which is conducted under the Additional Facility Rules. It emphasises the legal and conceptual distinctiveness of arbitration under the ICSID Convention and arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules, which it says precludes the transposition of the definition of \"investment\" from the former regime to the latter. In any event, Claimant asserts that its investment would satisfy even the strictest version of the definition.85\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 479-85; Tr. Day 2:370-77 (Terry); Tr. Day 4:837 (Terry).\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe question whether there is an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT is a question that must be answered by reference in the first place to the BIT.\n\n119.\n\nThere is no doubt that Claimant, a Canadian company, bought shares in PDV, a Venezuelan company, for the price of US$ 50 and \"owned or controlled\" those shares in PDV within the meaning of Article I(f) of the BIT. Ownership or control of shares is listed in Article I(f)(ii) of the BIT as one of the examples of an asset whose ownership or control can constitute an investment.\n\n120.\n\nAccordingly, it appears on the face of it that Claimant\u2019s ownership of shares in PDV could amount to an \"investment\" in PDV. There are, however, other aspects of Claimant\u2019s interest that must be considered before the question of the existence of jurisdiction under the BIT in respect of the claim in this case is definitively answered.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal had serious concerns about the nature and extent of Claimant\u2019s interest in Venezuela, and about the distinction between the making of an investment and the buying of a legal claim against the host State. The purely nominal purchase price (US$ 50) of its shareholding in PDV and its interest in the loans to MINCA86 is a notable feature of this case.\n\n*See* fn. 51 above.\n\n122.\n\nThe nominal purchase price does not of itself necessarily indicate that there was no real investment by Claimant. It is not unusual for the bulk of costs and benefits of an investment in a licence or concession to arise after the date of the licence or concession contract, in the form of contractually-obligated expenditure on the investment and of royalty and tax payments. (That possibility does, however, underline the importance of the continuing confidence of the contracting partners in one another, and emphasizes the great importance of the identity of the contracting partners.)\n\n123.\n\nIn the present case, however, Claimant\u2019s nominal payment for the shareholding occurred in a context that included the terms of the Original Transaction Agreement (and, in particular, Section 8.19 thereof, providing for the distribution between Vannessa and PBV of any proceeds recovered in this litigation),87 and the absence of any concrete technical or financial preparations on the part of Claimant such as could have enabled it at least to begin the resumption of operations at the Las Cristinas site promptly after its acquisition of the shares in PDV. Taken together, these factors make it debatable whether Claimant can properly be regarded as having made an investment in mining in Venezuela.\n\n*See \u00b6* 88 above.\n\n124.\n\nConsideration of the commercial stature and position of Vannessa at that time does not assuage this concern. Claimant says that Mr Rauguth, the founder of Vannessa, was a mining engineer with knowledge and experience of the mining industry in Venezuela. It says that Vannessa, while a small company lacking in-house financial and technical capabilities, and having no track record of commercially-successful mining, did possess experience and contacts that could have made it possible for it to draw together the resources required to exploit the opportunities in Las Cristinas. Respondent, on the other hand, viewed Vannessa as a small, speculative enterprise, noting that it had not been included among the 28 potential investors identified by Scotia in November 2000, and that it was lacking in mining and processing experience and had no operating revenues, cash flow, or relevant technical expertise.88 It was accepted by both sides that Vannessa had put forward no detailed plans of work whatever for Las Cristinas, and had secured neither the funding nor the equipment necessary to begin immediate work at the site in the summer of 2001.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, August 28, 2006 **(\"Respondent\u2019s** **Memorial on Jurisdiction\")** \u00b6 6.\n\n125.\n\nThere is more than one way in which these factors might be addressed, and more than one way in which any lack of good faith might put a putative \"investment\" outside of the scope of BIT protections. The \"reality\" or \"genuineness\" of the investment and the good faith of the investor are matters that might bear upon questions of jurisdiction, upon questions of admissibility, and upon questions of merits.\n\n126.\n\nArticle I of the BIT requires that in order to qualify as an \"investor\" a national or enterprise of one BIT Contracting Party must own or control, directly or indirectly, an asset of any kind (including shares or any other form of participation in a company, business enterprise or joint venture) in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter\u2019s laws. Article I does not explicitly assert that there is, beyond the requirement that the asset be owned or controlled in accordance with the host State\u2019s laws, a further requirement that the putative investment must qualify as a \"genuine\" or \"substantial\" investment in order to fall within the definition in Article I(f) of the BIT.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the requirement in Article I(f) of the BIT that the asset be \"owned or controlled... *in accordance with the latter\u2019s laws\"* is the next focus of attention in the analysis. As was explained above,89 one of us would have rejected the claim on the ground that there was no good-faith investment made by the Claimant in this case\u2014good faith being a principle of Venezuelan law\u2014and that the alleged investment fell, therefore, outside the scope of Article I of the BIT. The majority considers that the claim should not be rejected on the ground that the Claimant's investment was not made in good faith, because good faith is not an independent element of the definition of a protected investment in the BIT.\n\n*See* \u00b6 113 above.\n\n**B. Definition of \"Investment\" Step Two: \"asset owned or controlled... in accordance with\" the host State\u2019s laws**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n128.\n\nRespondent considers that Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article I(f) (see below) as a provision that is concerned only with the ownership of the asset is contrary to the duty to interpret the Treaty in good faith. Respondent argues that investments that are \"unlawful\" under domestic law cannot be protected under international investment law, and that the entitlement of investments to MFN treatment does not affect the prior question of the definition of the term \"investment\" itself.90 Respondent further emphasises that the \u2018legality requirement\u2019 demands conduct in good faith, both under Venezuelan Civil Law and, more broadly, as a paramount principle governing contractual relations.91\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 460-71. *See also* Tr. Day 3:706-10 (Goodman on why the argument about investments \"owned\" rather than \"made\" should be rejected); Tr. Day 3:710-12 and Tr.

Day 3:713-15 (Goodman).\n\n129.\n\nIn the oral proceedings, Respondent argued that the expression \"laws of Venezuela\" is not restricted to the type of legal rules formally defined as law *(i.e.,* statutes, decrees, *etc.),* which is what Claimant had submitted, but includes \"all of the legal system.\"92 That inclusive view would extend to contractual obligations in instruments such as the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement and Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, the Work Contract, and the August 8, 2000 agreement (Extension Agreement) to suspend the performance of the Work Contract for one year beginning on July 15, 2000.\n\nTr. Day 2:478-79 (Wray).\n\n*2. Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s Reply on Merits and Jurisdiction, two preliminary points are raised regarding the requirement under Article I(f) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT that the investment be \"in accordance with the latter\u2019s [the other contracting party\u2019s] laws.\" Claimant points out that the BIT requires the investment to be \"owned\", rather than \"made\", in accordance with the laws of the host State,93 and argues that this requirement was satisfied in this case by the registration with the Venezuelan Mercantile Registry of the books of the company recording the transfer of shares in Placer Venezuela to Vannessa Barbados and the renaming of Placer Venezuela as Vannessa Venezuela, without any objection by Venezuela, in July 2006.94\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 287-91.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 292-96. *See also* Tr. Day 1:29-33 (Laskin).\n\n131.\n\nMoreover, Claimant invokes the MFN treatment rules in Article III(1) and (2) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT to rely on what it says is the more favourable treatment in the Venezuela-UK BIT, which does not have the \"legality requirement\" in its definition of an investment.95\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 297-98. *See also* Tr. Day 1:33-37 and 1:67-69 (Laskin).\n\n132.\n\nAt the oral proceedings, in response to a question by the Tribunal, Claimant argued specifically that \"a violation of a contract is not, *ipso facto,* a violation of the law.\"96 Claimant also argued that the \"legality requirement\" is limited in its application to breaches of fundamental principles of law and of laws concerning foreign investments, and that it does not apply so as to bar the existence of jurisdiction in circumstances where that would be a disproportionate response to a breach of the law.97 An example might be late compliance with a requirement for registration of a share transfer that is not otherwise forbidden by the local law: such a breach, in Claimant\u2019s view, should not necessarily bar jurisdiction under the BIT.\n\nTr. Day 1:38 (Laskin). *See generally* Tr. Day 1:37-43 (Laskin).\n\nTr. Day 1:43-47 (Laskin).\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n133.\n\nAs far as the MFN provision is concerned, the Tribunal considers that the MFN treatment under the Canada-Venezuela BIT is promised to investments as defined in Article I of the BIT. The benefit of the MFN provision in Article III of the Canada-Venezuela BIT can only be asserted in respect of investments that are within the scope of Article I(f) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT to begin with. The MFN clause cannot be used to expand the category of investments to which the Canada-Venezuela BIT applies.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the reference to a host State\u2019s \"laws\" *(\"lois de [I\u2019autre partie contractante],\" \"leyes de [la otra Parte Contratante]\"')* in Article I(f) of the BIT is a reference to the laws and regulations made by, or under the authority of, the public authorities of the State, and does not extend to purely contractual obligations. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion by giving the term \"laws\" / \"lois\" / \"leyes\" its plain and ordinary meaning, in circumstances where Respondent did not demonstrate that the term should be given a different meaning.\n\n135.\n\nThat ordinary meaning points to laws made by the host State, and not to obligations created under the law by private persons. The Tribunal accordingly decides that, even if the transfer of shares in PDV to Claimant involved a breach of the contractual stipulations in the Shareholders Agreement, such breaches would not constitute a violation of Venezuela\u2019s \"laws\" for the purposes of BIT Article I(f).\n\n136.\n\nThe arguments relating to the \"legality requirement\" were developed further by the Parties in the specific contexts of: (i) constraints applicable as a matter of Venezuelan contract law and the doctrine of *intuitu personae* contracts; (ii) Venezuelan law on public procurement and administrative contracts; (iii) the principles of good faith and public policy; and (iv) Venezuelan Decree 2095. We address these in turn, in light of our decision on the meaning of \"[host State] laws.\"\n\n**C. Constraints on the Transfer of the Shareholding under Venezuelan Contract Law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n137.\n\nFor Respondent, the starting point of the analysis of the contractual issues is that Placer Dome was \"selected as a result of a private bid process [and] signed several instruments with the CVG to achieve a common public objective... All of these agreements are instrumental to the objective pursued, that is, they were signed as a means of achieving the expressed public objective - a joint venture to develop Las Cristinas.\"98 One of the consequences of this joint venture, as a matter of Venezuelan law, is the legal indivisibility of related contracts; namely, that all of the contracts instrumental to the development and exploitation of Las Cristinas have an identical objective, are interrelated, and cannot be considered in isolation.99\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 486. *See generally* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 480-87. *See also* Tr. Day 2:404- 33 (Brennan).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 489-501. With respect to indivisibility, *see* Tr. Day 2:435-43 (Brennan); Tr. Day 2:452-57 (Brennan); Tr. Day 2:485-504 (Wray).\n\n138.\n\nRespondent argues that, as a matter of Venezuelan law, the contracts instrumental to the development of Las Cristinas were of an *intuitu personae* nature and that \"this is a characteristic inherent to the economic operations in which all of the contracts are related and which therefore must be considered in interpreting them.\"100 It emphasises that Placer Dome \"was chosen specifically because of its characteristics to be the partner of CVG and, with CVG\u2019s consent it participated in MINCA through PDV, its vehicle, through which Placer Dome was going to exercise and perform its *intuitu personae* rights and obligations.\"101 PDV is not the real party in this matter; it is the continued participation by Placer Dome that is critical.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 503.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder\u00b6 513.\n\n139.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s argument that the 1991 Shareholders Agreement was superseded by the 1997 Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement. According to Respondent, the 1997 Agreement cancelled only the provisions of earlier agreements relating to its purpose *(i.e.,* the amendment of the financing terms), rather than the whole of the earlier agreements. In any event, the 1997 Amended Shareholders Agreement was itself an *intuitu personae* agreement and could not be assigned or delegated without the consent of CVG. Further, PDV is described in the preamble to the 1997 Amended Shareholders Agreement as being a party to that 1997 agreement \"in its capacity as PDFs investor.\"102 Finally, the participation of Placer Dome was so intertwined with that of PDV that, for Claimant to argue that they were different legal entities, would be to ignore reality.103\n\nEx. C-30.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 489-515. On the relationship between the 1991 and 1997 agreements, *see* Tr. Day 4:895-921 (Brennan).\n\n140.\n\nRespondent argues that the Original Transaction Agreement breached Venezuelan law by violating the **intuitu personae** nature of the obligations of Placer Dome with respect to the development of Las Cristinas. The rights and obligations acquired **intuitu personae** could not be transferred to Claimant without the express consent of CVG.104 The practice of CVG regarding changes of control in other mining companies, to which Claimant referred, is irrelevant: in those cases, unlike in this one, the \"creditor\" *(in casu,* CVG) was satisfied with the personal qualifications of the third party.105 Moreover, the transfer to Claimant of the shares effectively constituted an unauthorised transfer of the contract,106 in breach of the rules of Venezuelan contract law on non-assignment.107\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 776. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial\" 232-46.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 535.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 536-41.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 542-46.\n\n*2. Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n141.\n\nAs far as the restraints arising under Venezuelan contract law on the transfer of the shares in PDV are concerned, Claimant starts from the proposition that \"[i]t is a fundamental principle of both Venezuelan commercial and public law that shares of companies are freely transferable,\"108 and that restrictions on transferability must be explicitly provided for.109 Claimant argues that a provision that prohibits the assignment of contractual rights held by a company should not be presumed to prohibit the transfer of shares in that company or a change in the control of that company. Accordingly, the transfer of ownership or change of control of the company (MINCA) does not amount to a violation of the prohibition on the assignment of the company\u2019s contractual rights. Further, Claimant says that the application of these principles is not changed by labelling the relationship between CVG and PDV in MINCA as a \"joint venture\", as Respondent does.110\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6 308. *See also* Tr.

While the Work Contract111 and the 1997 Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement112 contained non-assignment provisions, neither they nor the MINCA Bylaws113 contained change of control clauses, unlike certain other contracts concluded by Venezuelan governmental agencies in the mining and oil sector which do include specific provisions on change of control.114\n\nEx.

This Amended Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each contracting party, and their permitted assignees.\").\n\nThe Bylaws did, however, give a right of first refusal. *See* Ex. C-6A, Art. 9 (\"[...].The Shareholders shall have a preferential right to purchase the shares that other Shareholders wish to sell for a consideration, in the proportion which the number of shares held by each shareholder at the time the sale offer is known bears to the total number of shares of the Company. For these purposes, the selling Shareholder shall send a letter to the Board of Directors of the Company informing it of the number of shares it wishes to sell, the name of the intended buyer and the purchase price. The Board of Directors shall give immediate notice of the offer to the other Shareholders, who shall have a term of thirty (30) calendar days to exercise their preferential right.  \n If the other Shareholders do not exercise their preferential right, or exercise it partially, the selling Shareholder may sell the remaining shares for a price no lower than the price informed to the Board of Directors.  \nAny transfer made in violation of this Clause shall be deemed to be void and without any effect upon the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of shares to related companies, wholly-owned by Shareholders, directly or indirectly, or by the Shareholder\u2019s parent Company are hereby authorized.\").\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 308-12. *See also* Tr. Day 1:55-56 (Laskin). With respect, in particular, to the general practice on change of control clauses, *see* Tr. Day 1:118-21 (Laskin).\n\n143.\n\nClaimant, challenging the view that these were *intuitu personae* contracts, says that the information provided in the private bidding process that led to the choice of Placer Dome was incomplete, and that there was accordingly nothing unique about Placer Dome.115 Counsel for Claimant submitted in the oral proceedings that \"[b]oth the bidding process and the fact of the broad assignment provision really are inconsistent with any suggestion of *intuitu personae,\"116*\n\nTr.

In Claimant\u2019s view, \"[t]he doctrine of **intuitu personae**... provides that some obligations under a contract are so personal in nature that they can only be performed expressly by the party that has assumed the obligations under the contract.\"117 However, the doctrine has no broader implications regarding other related contracts by the same party or contracts by its shareholders.118\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6 319. *See also* Tr. Day 1:121 (Laskin).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 316-21.\n\n145.\n\nIn terms of the contractual obligations, Claimant says that at the time of the transfer of shares from Placer Dome to Claimant *(i.e.,* on July 13, 2001) Placer Dome itself was (and continued to be) bound only by the 1997 Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, and further that it only had one narrow obligation under that agreement, namely, to assist in resolving financial issues.119 The 1991 Shareholders\u2019 Agreement was not applicable because it had been replaced by the 1997 Shareholders\u2019 Agreement (and not merely amended by it),120 as is stated in the 1997 Amended Agreement itself121 and confirmed by the practice of CVG, Placer Dome, and PDV.122 In any event, even the 1991 Shareholders\u2019 Agreement did not contain any restrictions on ownership of the shares of PDV.123\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 322-26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 340-42.

While conceding Placer Dome\u2019s ownership and factual involvement in the affairs of PDV, it says that, in the absence of explicit contractual language to the contrary, Placer Dome and PDV maintained their separate personalities for the purposes of the analysis of their legal rights and obligations.124 Finally, the acquisition by Claimant of the shares of PDV accorded with the general practice of other mining companies that had exploration agreements with CVG.125\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 344-55.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 356-64.\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the evidence demonstrates that as a matter of fact the identity of Placer Dome was a material element in the conclusion of the contracts relating to the exploitation of the Las Cristinas mines, and in particular of the 1991 Shareholders Agreement and the 1997 Amended Shareholders Agreement, the 1992 Work Contract, and the Copper Concessions. It cannot plausibly be argued that CVG was indifferent to the identity of the other party to the concessions and the Work Contract.\n\n148.\n\nTwo key indicators point to this conclusion. The first is the process by which Placer Dome was selected from among the companies that had expressed an interest in Las Cristinas. It is evident that PDI was selected after a deliberate, detailed, and careful consideration of its technical and financial capacity and experience, and which had been planned in advance.126\n\n*See* 50-54 above.\n\n149.\n\nSecond, it is apparent that the Parties themselves considered that Placer Dome had been chosen, not as an anonymous or generic supplier of services, but for its own particular qualities. Placer Dome wrote to CVG on May 17, 1991, not long after it had succeeded in the private bid process, on the subject of the organization of the project through what became MINCA:\n\nIn regards to the position of chairman, we have been guided by our understanding that CVG chose Placer Dome as the majority partner for its proven technical and commercial capacity to develop large-scale mines and not as a provider of technical services under the contract, or as a simple technical advisor. If this is the case, it seems logical and normal that Placer Dome would take on the majority of the operational decisions. In January we agreed that CVG would appoint the Director of Human Resources, the Controller and the Secretary, but we reserved the right to appoint the general manager, the primary finance official and the mine manager. We assume that CVG would like to appoint the chairman, although the operational authority of this position is, to a certain extent, only a formality, because for the joint company public relations and lobbying will be of great importance, and we believe that these tasks could be best carried out by a Venezuelan appointed by CVG.127\n\nIt is no less clear that CVG understood the relationship to have an *intuitu personae* character. It had the same view as Placer Dome, as evidenced by a memorandum to the President of Venezuela dated November 30, 1990, before the approval of the overall scheme by the cabinet in July 1991, in which the CVG stated: \"[n]one of the parties can transfer their rights or delegate obligations without prior consent by the other party, in writing, which cannot be denied without justifiable cause.\"128\n\nEx. R-4.\n\nEx. C-17A. The original Spanish version provided by Claimant does not include the following phrase which is included in the English version of the document, also provided by Claimant: \"which cannot be denied without justifiable cause\".\n\n150.\n\nAll of the evidence that the Tribunal has seen is consistent with this view of the relationship between CVG and Placer Dome. While it may be true that CVG\u2019s description of the relationship as a \"joint venture\" could not change the legal nature of the relationship, the description could reflect the clear and consistent understanding of CVG and Placer Dome as to the nature of the enterprise that Placer Dome had applied to undertake with CVG, and for which it had been selected. The Tribunal finds that it did reflect such an understanding.\n\n151.\n\nIn that context, the Tribunal was assisted by the expert evidence of Professor Luis Garc\u00eda Montoya concerning the *intuitu personae* nature of the relationship and the contracts.129\n\n*See* the Expert Reports of Professor Luis Garc\u00eda Montoya dated August 10, 2006, February 14, 2007, March 10, 2009, and January 27, 2010.\n\n152.\n\nFurther, it is plain that PDV was regarded as Placer Dome\u2019s vehicle for the purposes of this investment, so that it stood in the same relationship to CVG as did Placer Dome itself. Indeed, the preamble to the 1997 Amended Shareholder Agreement records explicitly that its provisions are the product of the agreement of \"CVG, PDI, *and PDVEN, in its capacity as PDFs Investor\"* (emphasis added).130\n\nEx. C-30. PDI is defined as Placer Dome Inc., and PDVEN is defined as Placer Dome de Venezuela C.A.\n\n153.\n\nIt is also evident that Vannessa had a radically different technical and financial profile from that of Placer Dome. Placer Dome was a very large mining company, specializing in gold mining, with mining operations in several countries. At the time when the transfer to Vannessa took place, within hours of the expiry of the agreed suspension period, Vannessa, in contrast, had no firm financial or technical capacity in place which could have made immediate resumption of operations at Las Cristinas even a possibility. When it took over the shares in PDV, Vannessa was not in a position to discharge the obligations that Placer Dome had assumed in respect of Las Cristinas. Moreover, the \"staged development plan\", which Vannessa was apparently contemplating into 2001, appears to have been essentially the same as the staged development plan that CVG had refused to accept when it was proposed by Placer Dome in 2000.131\n\n*See* \u00b670 above.\n\n154.\n\nNonetheless, the *intuitu personae* character of the contracts does not itself put Claimant\u2019s ownership of shares *in PDV* outside the scope of the Canada-Venezuela BIT. As was indicated above,132 the Tribunal has decided that the ordinary meaning of the reference to \"the [host State\u2019s] laws\" is a reference to laws imposed by public authority. It is a corollary of this decision that obligations created by persons in the exercise of their powers under the general laws of contract are not \"laws\", and should not be treated as creating \"requirements\" which, if not satisfied, will automatically place ownership of an asset outside the scope of the definition of an investment in Article I(f) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT. The Tribunal\u2019s view that the participation of Placer Dome, rather than any other company, was an essential part of the *contractual* arrangements in respect of Las Cristinas does not, therefore, preclude Claimant\u2019s ownership of shares *in PDV* from satisfying the BIT\u2019s definition of \"investment.\" That is not, however, to say that the *intuitu personae* character of the contracts relating to Las Cristinas is without any legal effect, as is explained below.133 The point is plainly relevant to the question whether Claimant acquired an interest in MINCA and Las Cristinas that is protected by the BIT.\n\n*See* \u00b6 133 above.\n\n*See* \u00b6 164 below.\n\n**D. In Accordance with the Law on Public Procurement and Administrative Contracts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n155.\n\nRespondent takes the view that Claimant\u2019s investment was made in violation of the Venezuelan law of public procurement. That law limits a private party\u2019s ability to transfer rights and obligations under a contract awarded in a bid process so that they would not wind up in the hands of unreliable third parties (as indeed happened, in Respondent\u2019s opinion, in this particular instance).134\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 547-51.\n\n156.\n\nRespondent notes Claimant\u2019s recognition that the Work Contract is an administrative contract.135 Respondent rejects the argument by Claimant that the Shareholders\u2019 Agreements and MINCA Bylaws, in contrast, are not administrative contracts. In Respondent\u2019s view, the test is whether the contract has a \"public purpose\", and there is no requirement under Venezuelan public law for an administrative contract to have a direct, rather than an indirect, public purpose. In any event those Shareholder Agreements and MINCA Bylaws would, in Respondent\u2019s view, satisfy even a \"direct purpose\" requirement, because they address the adoption of provisions concerning the mining operations at Las Cristinas.136 Respondent argues that the transfer of rights and obligations arising under an administrative contract would breach Venezuelan public law, by rendering meaningless the bidding process and the nature of administrative contracts.137\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder\u00b6 362.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 516-23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 547-51.\n\n2. *Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n157.\n\nClaimant challenges the assertion by Respondent that Placer Dome had been selected for the Las Cristinas project through a public bidding process. Claimant disagrees with Respondent\u2019s argument on two levels: first, as a general matter, the bidding process was conducted in private and not in public;138 second, in any event, the public nature of the bidding process could not turn the contracts into administrative contracts, or make the conditions of the bid an inherent part of the contract, or give greater rights of revocation to CVG.139\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 367-73.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 374-77.\n\n158.\n\nClaimant accepts that the Work Contract could be considered to be an administrative contract, because its purpose was directly to carry out mining activity (assuming that mining is a public service under Venezuelan law).140 However, the Shareholders\u2019 Agreements and MINCA Bylaws do not themselves satisfy the cumulative criteria under Venezuelan law which identifies administrative contracts.141 Further, the administrative nature of the Work Contract would not have any effect on the transferability of the shares in PDV.142\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6 387.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 388-93.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 395-96.\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in Section 3.2.4 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the (differently-constituted) Tribunal in this case said that:\n\n[I]t is obvious from the file that [the Respondent] never ruled on the permissibility or lack thereof of the share transfer. What it complained of and acted accordingly was that it considered the behaviour of PDI and the Claimant to constitute a breach of the agreements binding PDI to the Las Cristinas Project. It, however, never stated that it did not authorize the transfer of the shares which, after all, were transferred and have remained with the Claimant.\n\n160.\n\nThat observation was made in the context of Section II(3)(b) of the Annex to the Canada-Venezuela BIT, according to which decisions of a Contracting Party not to permit establishment of a new business enterprise or acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise by investors or prospective investors are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of Article XII of the BIT. Though the transfer of shares had not been barred for the purposes of that provision, it is necessary to consider here whether the (legally effective) transfer of the shares constitutes a breach of Venezuelan law on public procurement and administrative contracts that would take the shareholding outside the scope of the definition of an investment in Article I(f) of the BIT so as to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction in this case. The Tribunal finds that the public procurement law does not impact whether Claimant\u2019s shareholding amounts to an \"asset owned or controlled... in accordance with\" Venezuelan law as required to satisfy the BIT\u2019s definition of \"investment.\" Respondent does not deny that Vannessa Barbados legally owned, and continues to own, the shares in question in accordance with the Venezuelan Commercial Code, as recorded in the Venezuelan Mercantile Registry.143 The question whether the acquisition by Claimant of that shareholding also had the legal effect of validly transferring to Claimant an interest in MINCA and in Las Cristinas that is protected by the BIT is a question that relates to the stage at which the Tribunal considers the admissibility and the merits of the claim.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 465-564; Claimant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 293.\n\n**E. In Accordance With Good Faith and Public Policy**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n161.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant violated both Venezuelan and international law by consciously engaging in conduct equivalent to fraud on the law, *i.e.,* \"a performance of actions that are legitimate in form or appearance, but are illicit in their object and purpose.\"144 Respondent says that the agreements were concluded behind CVG\u2019s back, against its opposition and ignoring its interests.145 Respondent argues that bad-faith investments are not protected by the BIT as a matter of international law. It says that Claimant\u2019s bad-faith conduct fits the characteristics identified in earlier arbitral decisions, in that it involved: acting in secrecy or without transparency; misrepresentation and false statements; disavowal of obligations and circumvention of agreements; and the abuse of legal process for improper purposes.146\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 552.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 553-64.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 565-99.\n\n2. *Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n162.\n\nClaimant argues that the acquisition of shares took place in good faith. It says that it is up to Respondent to prove Claimant\u2019s bad faith, that the burden of proof is a demanding one, and that Respondent has not met it.147 In terms of arbitral decisions addressing fraud and good faith, Claimant distinguishes this particular dispute as not involving any of the aspects considered decisive in other decisions *(e.g.,* falsification of documents, breach of domestic law against the advice of the investor\u2019s counsel, or misrepresentation).148 In factual terms, Claimant rejects the argument that Placer Dome acted in bad faith, arguing that Placer Dome met and even exceeded its contractual obligations, and that it had reasonable prudential business reasons not to disclose the identity of the prospective purchaser of shares to CVG.149 It says that, in any event, Placer Dome is not a claimant in this case, and its possible bad faith should not affect the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.150\n\nTr.

Claimant acknowledges that it is a small company but argues that it was able to undertake that particular project, and that it had taken the mining project seriously.151 Claimant also noted in the oral proceedings that Crystallex, an investor that subsequently signed an agreement with CVG regarding Las Cristinas, appeared not to be substantially better qualified than Claimant.152\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 427-50.\n\nTr. Day 4:746-54 (Laskin).\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n164.\n\nIn the view of the majority of the Tribunal, the arguments about good faith and public policy that have been advanced in this case are not determinative of whether Claimant\u2019s shares in PDV were owned or controlled in accordance with Venezuelan law. Instead, good faith and public policy bear upon the question whether the acquisition by Claimant of its shareholding in PDV was effective to transfer to Claimant an interest in MINCA and in Las Cristinas that is protected by the BIT. Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal does not consider that in the circumstances of this case the principles of public policy and good faith place Claimant\u2019s ownership of shares in PDV beyond the BIT\u2019s definition of investment.\n\n**F. In Accordance With Venezuelan Decree 2095**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n165.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant failed to give notice of the transfer of the shares in PDV, and also to register the investment (which had apparently not been registered by the original owner, Placer Dome), as required under Venezuela\u2019s Decree 2095, and that the failure to comply with this mandatory legal requirement means that the investment was not in accordance with law.153\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 284-87.\n\n*2. Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n166.\n\nClaimant takes the view that it did in fact comply with the requirements for providing notice about share purchases to the Foreign Investments Commission, as required by the Venezuelan Decree 2095.154 In any event, the failure to comply with the Decree would not make the transfer of shares invalid, as demonstrated by the lack of Venezuela\u2019s response to widespread failures of notification during the 1990s.155\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 451-60.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 451-58; Tr. Day 1:144-46 (Laskin).\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that reporting obligations concerning the registration of foreign investments, which do not entail any application for permission or approval and which are not expressed as conditions of the making of an investment, are not relevant to the question whether the investment exists. Further, the jurisdictional significance of the \"legality requirement\" in the definition of an investment in Article I(f) is exhausted once the investment has been made. It accordingly rejects the jurisdictional challenge based on the provisions of Decree 2095.\n\n**G. The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the majority of the Tribunal is satisfied that Claimant has an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article I of the Canada-Venezuela BIT, and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the merits of this dispute. While the majority of the Tribunal rests its decision on that ground, it recognizes that there are different ways in which the principle of good faith might be applied in the context of decisions on jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n169.\n\nOne of us takes the view that if an investment is acquired in bad faith, this is a factor that goes to the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. That member would have rejected the claim on the basis that it falls outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because the investment was not made in good faith. As was noted above (and is explained further below), however, all three members agreed that, in light of the manner in which Vannessa was substituted for Placer Dome in the project for the exploitation of Las Cristinas,156 the treatment of the investment by Respondent does not amount to a breach of the standards of treatment required by the Treaty.\n\n*See \u00b6* 201 below.\n\n**II. MERITS**\n--------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal is unanimously of the view that the claim in this case must fail because of the manner in which the transfer of shares to Claimant occurred. Its reasoning is set out in the following paragraphs.\n\n171.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent\u2019s actions breach the obligations: (a) not to expropriate the investment except in accordance with the conditions set out in Article VII of the Treaty; and (b) to treat the investment in a fair and equitable manner and to accord it full protection and security under Article II(2).\n\n**A. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n*1. Claimant\u2019s Position: Gold Rights*\n-------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nClaimant argues that the standard for finding an expropriation of contractual rights is that \"the State has gone beyond its role as a mere party to the contract and relied on its superior governmental power. [...] [T]he State uses its public authority and steps out of the role of the contracting party.\"157 In the oral proceedings, Claimant argued that \"there is culmination of the State acting in terminating the contract for reasons that are not legitimate contractual considerations; plus the State stepping out of the contractual framework and exercising State powers to terminate in a way that a private party can\u2019t; plus, thirdly, the CVG in the particular case acting in conjunction with other State agencies.\"158\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6 492 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\nTr. Day 1:182 (Terry). *See more generally,* the discussion of the test of expropriation of contractual rights at Tr. Day 1:161-86 (Terry).\n\n173.\n\nClaimant argues that expropriation is evidenced in three instances. The first is when CVG rescinded the Work Contract on November 6, 2001. It says that Venezuelan law precludes unilateral termination of a contract without first resorting to the agreed mechanism of dispute settlement, whether in court or via arbitration. Though the Work Contract provided for ICC arbitration, CVG did not resort to it but rather relied on its exorbitant administrative law powers that allegedly exempted it from this requirement regarding administrative contracts.159 Therefore, the case is distinguishable from those investment arbitrations where the State committed a merely contractual breach and other remedies were available to the investor.160 In the oral proceedings, Claimant also relied on its legitimate expectations regarding the competence of the government to submit contractual disputes to arbitration.161 Further, it also clarified its position by suggesting that termination and failure to arbitrate constituted two separate bases for its expropriation claim.162\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 494-508. Counsel for Claimant emphasized that there was agreement between experts and probably parties that \"the termination, whether it was lawful or not as a matter of Venezuelan law was carried out by a State agency using its exorbitant power. As Dr. Grau says, to quote him again, using a public power, not a power having a contractual source.\" *See* Tr. Day 4:820 (Terry). *See also* Tr. Day 4:822 (Teny).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 494-508; Tr. Day 4:811-27 (Terry).\n\nTr. Day 2:258-60 (Terry).\n\nTr. Day 2:311-13 (Terry).\n\n174.\n\nSecondly, according to Claimant, CVG relied on exorbitant administrative powers to seize MINCA\u2019s assets on 16 November 2001. The seizure of assets by a squadron of the Venezuelan National Guard to enforce an administrative act without resorting to judicial assistance could not have been carried out by a party exercising merely its commercial prerogatives.163\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 520-27.\n\n175.\n\nThirdly, and more broadly, Claimant argues that the Ministry of Energy and the President of the Republic had assisted CVG in carrying out its expropriation. Rather than merely disposing of the mining rights after the rescinding of the Work Contract, the Ministry and the President were necessary and active participants in the expropriation.164\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 515-19.\n\n176.\n\nClaimant considers that the expropriation was unlawful because it did not satisfy the criteria of lawfulness set out in Article VII(l) of the BIT.165 First, while Venezuelan law provides that contracts may be terminated for reasons of general or public interest, rather than on the basis of the breach, so long as compensation is paid, CVG never invoked reasons of such a nature. Secondly, due process was not provided either in the contractually agreed arbitral forum or in the domestic courts. Thirdly, the expropriation was discriminatory because no other company or property received this treatment. Fourthly, no compensation was paid to Claimant.166\n\n*See* Ex. R-39 *(i.e.,* that the expropriation be for a public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 528-40. On due process, *see also* Tr. Day 2:290-302 (Terry), Tr. Day 2:313-14 (Terry). In the context of due process, Claimant explained that the nullity action was withdrawn in July 2004 because of the time limits for BIT claims and the requirement to discontinue other proceedings. *See* Tr. Day 2:302-03 (Terry).\n\n177.\n\nFinally, Claimant rejects Respondent\u2019s argument that the allegedly expropriated contractual rights were already null and void. Claimant says that the Venezuelan authorities had never sought to nullify Claimant\u2019s ownership of the shares, and the attempt to terminate the Work Contract necessarily presupposed that the Work Contract continued to exist.167\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 541-42.\n\n2. *Claimant\u2019s Position: Copper Rights*\n---------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, MINCA had valid and binding rights to the Las Cristinas Copper Concessions, assigned by CVG in January 1999 in accordance with the 1997 Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement. These rights were expropriated when the Ministry of Energy and Mines cancelled the concession on March 8, 2001. The failure of MINCA to file reports and feasibility studies could not justify the cancellation because the Ministry itself had not obtained for MINCA the necessary land use permit, without which exploration could not begin.168\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 543-46; Tr. Day 2:320-23 (Terry).\n\n179.\n\nClaimant argues that the expropriation of the right to mine copper was unlawful because of the discriminatory nature of the cancellation, which affected only Claimant; because the alleged public purpose disguised the real reason - which was to transfer rights to CVG (and eventually to Crystallex); because of the failure of due process; and because of the clear absence of compensation.169\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 547-50.\n\n*3. Respondent \u2019s Position: Gold Rights*\n----------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nRespondent states that \"the key question in assessing whether a State\u2019s taking of a claimant\u2019s property constitutes an expropriation is not whether the State acted as only a private party could act, but rather, did the State step out of its role as a contracting party and interfere with the contract on the basis of its sovereign authority.\"170 Claimant errs in setting the criterion as whether a State has acted as a \"private party\", because the State is never simply a private party; and even in its contractual capacity the State retains such inherent capabilities as acting through resolutions and decrees.171 Also, Claimant is wrong in alleging that the availability of a pre-agreed forum for the resolution of disputes is necessary if the wrongful termination of a concession or similar agreement is to be treated as a contractual dispute and not as an expropriation; and, in any event, MINCA could have referred, but did not refer, the termination of the Work Contract to ICC arbitration.172\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 664. On the standard, *see also,* Tr. Day 3:536-51 and Tr. Day 3:561-83 (Goodman).\n\nAs Respondent\u2019s counsel put it, \"if you sign up for a footrace with a three-legged person, you know that that person will have that kind of attribute and that they may in that sense outperform you.... [fit\u2019s a question of the CVG having that authority. It\u2019s not something that it\u2019s exerting in order to interfere with the contractual process. It can\u2019t do otherwise. It\u2019s part of the administrative law scheme.\" *See* Tr. Day 3:540 (Goodman).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 653-67.\n\n181.\n\nRespondent argues that it has rightfully terminated MINCA\u2019s rights to exploit gold in response to MINCA\u2019s breaches of contract. CVG had the right under the Work Contract to terminate the contract in case of an uncorrected contractual breach by the other party. Three breaches warranted the termination: (i) suspension by MINCA of exploitation works without a duly justified reason for more than 12 months; (ii) failure by MINCA to submit detailed reports on its activities for a period of two years; and (iii) most importantly, the breach of the obligation of non-assignment without approval by the other party.173\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 668-76.\n\n182.\n\nRegarding the particular instances of expropriation alleged by Claimant, Respondent takes the view that it had acted only as a State contracting party to an administrative contract, and not on the basis of an unlawful exercise of sovereign authority. Respondent rejects the argument that contractual termination by CVG without resort to ICC arbitration amounted to expropriation. The Work Contract does not include such a requirement, and Venezuelan law does not provide such a rule for administrative contracts.174 The fact that CVG terminated the contract by means of a decree is, on its own, irrelevant: State organs commonly act through decrees and resolutions. What is important is that termination took place in response to a contractual breach, and was promulgated within the contractual framework rather than in contravention of it.175\n\nAs the counsel for Respondent put it at the hearing, \"[T]he decision made by the public administration is self-imposed.... [T]he public administration has the power of self-protection... [A] decision made by the administration is imperative. There is no need to resort to a court.\" *See* Tr. Day 3:517 (Wray).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 680-96.\n\n183.\n\nSecondly, Respondent rejects the argument that CVG\u2019s recovery of MINCA\u2019s assets amounted to expropriation. In its view, Claimant has asked the wrong question - could a private party have done it? - rather than whether \"the CVG\u2019s actions exceed the normal conduct that other State entities party to an administrative contract would have taken in executing its termination.\"176 By applying this criterion, the recovery of property was within the four corners of CVG\u2019s rights to recover the property in accordance with the administrative contract.177\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 698.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 697-708; Tr. Day 3:589-94 (Hodgson).\n\n184.\n\nThirdly, the involvement of the Ministry of Energy and Mining and the President would not amount to expropriation. It has not been demonstrated that their acts breached the Work Contract, and in any event their involvement occurred after its termination.178\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 709-15; Tr. Day 3:594-98 (Hodgson).\n\n185.\n\nRespondent rejects the argument that there was discriminatory treatment of Claimant, arguing that the transfers of shares of other mining companies, which the State had accepted, took place in significantly different circumstances.179 Respondent denies any obligation to pay compensation.180 Respondent argues that any expropriation would not have been unlawful in any event because the challenged acts pursued a public purpose, were not discriminatory, and complied with due process,181 and the lack of compensation alone does not render expropriation unlawful.182\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 677-78.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 780-86.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 862-73.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 874-77.\n\n186.\n\nFinally, Respondent takes the view that the unlawful assignment of the contractual rights to Claimant invalidated both the Work Contract and the transfer of shares. The invalidation of the underlying contractual relationships that have been allegedly expropriated, by reason of the conduct of Claimant and of Placer Dome, provides an alternative ground for rejecting the expropriation claim.183\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 772-79.\n\n*4. Respondent\u2019s Position: Copper Rights*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nRespondent argues first, that MINCA did not hold any valid Copper Concession rights in the first place; and secondly, that the Ministry of Energy and Mining lawfully extinguished any residual concessionary rights of MINCA that might have existed. The lack of any valid concession rights flows from four considerations: (i) the absence of mandatory permits for land use and exploration; (ii) the invalidation of the incidental rights to copper by the termination of the Work Contract; (iii) the invalidity of the assignment of the Copper Concessions; and (iv) the absence of serious plans by Claimant to mine copper.184 In any event, the cancellation of the Copper Concessions took place on the basis of MINCA\u2019s non-compliance, and the alleged governmental involvement neither is demonstrated in factual terms nor would amount to expropriation by the application of the correct standard of expropriation.185 Finally, Respondent notes that Claimant had been provided with due process,186 and denies any obligation to pay compensation.187\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 716-38; Tr. Day 3:598-600 (Hodgson).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 739-62; Tr. Day 3:600-05 (Hodgson).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6763-71.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 780-86.\n\n*5. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the rights in respect of gold and the rights in respect of copper were so closely interrelated and interdependent that they can be considered together in relation to the arguments that Claimant\u2019s rights under the Canada-Venezuela BIT have been violated. That conclusion follows both from the history and structure of the commercial relationship between the Parties, and from a close reading of the relevant legal instruments.\n\n189.\n\nWhile the Work Contract of March 4, 1992 does not specifically mention copper, it appears to the Tribunal that the Copper Concessions were granted in such a way that they were covered by the Work Contract. The Amended Shareholders Agreement of July 31, 1997 stated that:\n\nCVG, at MINCA\u2019s request, has filed applications with MEM for copper concessions at Las Cristinas, in performing the provisions relating to new minerals set forth in the [Work Contract dated] March 4, 1992. CVG hereby undertakes to transfer said concession to MINCA, by means of direct assignment, as soon as the same are awarded by MEM to CVG...,188\n\nEx. C-30 at Section 4.02.\n\n190.\n\nIndeed, on April 7, 1999, the Work Contract was amended to reflect, among other things, that the royalty scheme for gold would apply to copper as well.189 Finally, the Copper Concession Agreement (made between CVG and MINCA on April 19, 1999) itself also explained that MINCA would pay CVG a royalty for \u2019\u2019copper under the same terms and conditions as specified in Annex III of the [Work Contract of March 1992].\" Thus, viewing these agreements together, it is clear that the copper concession was interrelated with the Work Contract in such a way that termination of the Work Contract operated to terminate it as well. As far as the termination of the Work Contract itself is concerned, the Tribunal finds that Venezuela\u2019s action was both justified and legitimate.\n\nEx. C-21A at pp. 3-4. In addition, it should be noted that the sixth paragraph of the Copper Concession Agreement states that the property \"will be reverted... *if for any cause the Republic decides to revoke the* *CONCESSIONS,* or if they lapse with the expiration of the term for which they were granted\" (emphasis added), *see* Ex. R-67.\n\n191.\n\nOn 8 August 2000, CVG, Placer Dome, PDV, and MINCA entered into an agreement to suspend the performance of the Work Contract for a period of one year beginning on 15 July 2000 (Extension Agreement).190\n\n*See* Ex. C-60A. The Work Contract is referred to as \"the Agreement\" in the Extension Agreement, but is elsewhere in the pleadings and this award referred to as the Work Contract.\n\n192.\n\nThe Extension Agreement had a very clear purpose: to grant the parties time \"to find an investor interested in participat[ing] in MINCA and/or in the Project\"191 and to do so \"by mutual agreement.\"192\n\n*Id.* at 2.\n\n*Id.* at 3-5.\n\n193.\n\nSpecifically, the parties to the Extension Agreement agreed that, within 30 days following its execution, they would hire an investment bank *\"by mutual agreement,\"193* prepare a schedule of activities *\"by mutual agreement\"* together with an investment bank *\"chosen by the Parties\"* to establish the parameters for locating an investor;194 and in the event that a third party expressed its interest in participating in MINCA and/or the Project and met the standards jointly determined, *\"the Parties* shall make their best efforts to favour the incorporation of such third party to the Project.\"195\n\n*Id.* at 4.\n\n*Id.* at 3.\n\n*Id.* at 3-5 (emphasis added).\n\n194.\n\nThus, the Extension Agreement, which necessarily modified the Work Contract, spelled out that Placer Dome and the CVG would work *together* to find either an entirely new party to replace Placer Dome, or a third party to join Placer Dome and CVG in the Project.\n\n195.\n\nYet although the Extension Agreement plainly required mutual cooperation and agreement in selecting an investor, Placer Dome engaged in secret negotiations and share transfers with Vannessa, only to \"inform\" CVG after the fact, on July 13, 2001, that it had been successful in \"its\" search for a new investor within the period governed by the Extension Agreement.196\n\n*See* Ex. C-95A, Letter from W. Hayes, Placer Dome Executive Vice President for the United States and Latin America to F. Rangel G\u00f3mez, CVG President (July 13, 2001) at 1. *See also* Ex. R-105, Letter from E. Rauguth, Vannessa Ventures, Ltd Executive Vice President, to F. Rangel, CVG President (October 30, 2001) (English translation) at 1 (\"Our negotiation with Placer Dome was governed by strict rules of confidentiality, forbidding the parties from discussing or sharing it with any third party. That is the reason why Vannessa did not contact the CVG prior to the purchase.\").\n\n196.\n\nSince that Agreement extended until July 14, 2001, Placer Dome was obligated to work with CVG up until the end of the extension to find a mutually-acceptable new investor, and it was not open to Placer Dome to thrust a new investor on CVG without its consent. Thus the failure of Placer Dome to work mutually under the Extension Agreement to insert a new investor provided a legitimate basis upon which CVG could terminate the Work Contract. In other words, the term on which the one-year extension was granted was breached by Placer Dome and hence the Extension Agreement was voided.197\n\nIt is of no moment that Scotia Capital, the investment bank chosen to find a new investor, suspended its activities in May 2001 by agreement of the CVG and Placer Dome. The Extension Agreement itself was never terminated and its spirit still underlay the parties\u2019 search for a new investor. Indeed, that the \"spirit\" of the Extension Agreement still governed the parties\u2019 behavior is admitted by Placer Dome in its July 13, 2001 letter. *See infra.* Furthermore, even if Vannessa\u2019s allegations are true that the CVG failed to act diligently in attempts to find a new investor, this is insufficient justification for Placer Dome to have acted in excess of its power in order to incorporate a new investor unilaterally.\n\n197.\n\nAs Claimant has pointed out, the Extension Agreement \"was a consensual 12-month suspension, not the kind of unjustified 12-month stoppage that would give the CVG the right to rescind under Article 19 of the [Work] Contract.\"198 As this consensual suspension was rendered void by Placer Dome\u2019s actions in incorporating Vannessa as the putative new investor, Venezuela\u2019s right to rescind under Article 19 was revived.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6 82.\n\n198.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that the breach of the Extension Agreement was one of the main bases upon which CVG sought to terminate the Work Contract. In a letter to MEM, General Rangel G\u00f3mez stated that the decision was \"essentially based on the conduct of the company Placer Dome... to transfer its shares in PDV to the company I.H.C. Corp., a subsidiary of Vanesa [sic] Ventures L.T.D., as a way of evading the C.V.G.\u2019s... right to participate in the selection of a new (third-party) shareholder in MINCA, as expressly stipulated in contractual provisions signed by both parts of that company...,\"199 In its Reply, Claimant states that \"[t]he contracts to which General Rangel Gomez was referring were the MINCA Bylaws..., the 1997 Shareholders\u2019 Agreement..., and the *Extension Agreement. \"200*\n\nEx. R-48 (emphasis added).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at \u00b6\u00b6 208-09 (emphasis added).\n\n199.\n\nMoreover, in its July 13, 2001 letter to CVG, Placer Dome implicitly admitted that it was required to comply with the Extension Agreement, taking the position (without elaboration) that its agreement to sell its shares in PDV to Vannessa fell \"within the spirit\" of the Extension Agreement.201 Yet, as just explained, far from falling \"within the spirit\" of the Extension Agreement, Placer Dome\u2019s actions in incorporating Vannessa as a third-party investor unilaterally, and without CVG\u2019s input, were in fact directly contrary to that spirit and, what is more, to the Extension Agreement\u2019s plain language.\n\n*See* Ex. C-95A, Letter from W. Hayes, Placer Dome Executive Vice President for the United States and Latin America to F. Rangel G\u00f3mez, CVG President (July 13, 2001) at 1 *([Este acuerdo [celebrado entre* *Placer Dome y Vannessa] que por este medio le participamos se encuentra dentro del esp\u00edritu del \u00faltimo convenio de pr\u00f3rroga*...)

It should be noted that the English translation Claimant provided does not contain the words \"within the spirit\" (though they are plainly contained in the Spanish version), but translates the phrase simply thus: \"The agreement [entered into by Placer Dome and Vannessa] that we are notifying you of at this time falls within the last extension agreement....\"\n\n200.\n\nSuch a violation of the Extension Agreement amounts to a breach, rendering Venezuela\u2019s subsequent decision to terminate the Work Contract both justified and legitimate. It destroyed the basis of the relationship upon which the exploitation of Las Cristinas by CVG and its partner in the project was premised.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal has already explained that it considers that the evidence shows clearly that the identity and specific experience and characteristics of Placer Dome were material factors in its selection as the foreign investor in the Las Cristinas project.202 That is evident from the process by which Placer Dome came to be selected, and is a factor of central importance in this case. There is no basis on which it could reasonably be supposed that Venezuela was indifferent to the identity or the technical and commercial characteristics and experience of its partner in the Las Cristinas project, or that it would be consistent with the nature of the relationship as understood by the Parties simply to substitute one company for another in that role, without Venezuela\u2019s consent. Besides having been recognized by both parties, as mentioned in paragraph 54 of this Award, the *intuitu personae* character of the relationship was also acknowledged through provisions in a series of documents.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 50-54 above.\n\n202.\n\nFirst, both Shareholders\u2019 Agreements included an article restricting the transfer of the rights of their signatories under them. In the 1991 Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, entered into between Placer Dome and CVG, Article V.D. stated:\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without first obtaining the prior written consent of the other party which shall not be unreasonably withheld. This Agreement shall enure to and be binding upon each of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.203\n\nIn the 1997 Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, entered into between Placer Dome, PDV, and CVG, Section 10.01 stated:\n\nUnless otherwise provided herein, the parties cannot assign their rights or delegate their obligations hereunder without the other party\u2019s prior written consent. This Amended Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each contracting party, and their permitted assignees.204\n\nEx. C-5A.\n\nEx. C-30.\n\n203.\n\nSecond, the MINCA By-laws also included an article by which the shares belonging to one of the shareholders could not be sold before they had first been offered to the other shareholders, which means that any such transfer also needed a kind of implied authorization of the other shareholder, constituted by its refusal to buy the shares. Article 9 of the MINCA By-laws provided that:\n\n[...] The Shareholders shall have a preferential right to purchase the shares that other Shareholders wish to sell for a consideration, in the proportion which the number of shares held by each shareholder at the time the sale offer is known bears to the total number of shares of the Company. For these purposes, the selling Shareholder shall send a letter to the Board of Directors of the Company informing it of the number of shares it wishes to sell, the name of the intended buyer and the purchase price. The Board of Directors shall give immediate notice of the offer to the other Shareholders, who shall have a term of thirty (30) calendar days to exercise their preferential right. If the other Shareholders do not exercise their preferential right, or exercise it partially, the selling Shareholder may sell the remaining shares for a price no lower than the price informed to the Board of Directors.\n\nAny transfer made in violation of this Clause shall be deemed to be void and without any effect upon the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of shares to related companies, wholly-owned by Shareholders, directly or indirectly, or by the Shareholder\u2019s parent Company are hereby authorized.205\n\nEx. C-6A.\n\n204.\n\nWhile in this case it was not PDV that was selling its shares in MINCA, but rather a senior wholly owned subsidiary of Placer Dome that was selling its shares in PDV, this does not detract from the indication that is implicit in Article 9 of the MINCA Bylaws that it mattered who the partners in the project were, and that new shareholders could not be introduced without the consent of the other shareholders.\n\n205.\n\nThird, Clause Twenty Eighth of the Work Contract stipulated that \"the parties may not assign in any manner this agreement except by prior written approval of the other party.\"206 Article X (Assignment; Binding Effect) of the 1997 Amended Shareholders\u2019 Agreement207 made by CVG and Placer Dome stipulated:\n\nUnless otherwise provided herein, the parties cannot assign their rights or delegate their obligations hereunder without the other party\u2019s prior written consent. This Amended Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each contracting party, and their permitted assignees.\n\nThe fact that an assignment \"in any manner\" was forbidden unless prior written consent was obtained from the other party means, in the understanding of the Tribunal, that an assignment could not be made indirectly by a change of the owner of the shares of MINCA.\n\nEx. C-20A, Clause Twenty Eighth.\n\nEx. C-30.\n\n206.\n\nMoreover, as was noted above, the only clear way in which a change of control could be effected in accordance with the MINCA Bylaws, through the Article 9 pre-emption procedure, was not followed.208 Placer Dome clearly sought to withdraw from the partnership that was secured by the structure of MINCA and to insert another company in its place. But Placer Dome did not present CVG with the price of the deal with Vannessa before it was completed and allow 30 days for CVG to meet that price. Indeed, at the very meeting at which the President of MINCA met Mr Pinedo, in-house counsel for PDV, to inform Placer Dome of CVG\u2019s decision to consider Placer Dome\u2019s proposal, Mr Pinedo advised MINCA\u2019s President for the first time of the impending sale to Vannessa. Despite Placer Dome\u2019s proposal to sell to CVG, and CVG\u2019s interest in considering the proposal, Claimant disrupted this process by thrusting on CVG the deal that it had agreed with Vannessa.\n\n*See* \u00b6 74 above.\n\n207.\n\nThe unavoidable conclusion is that this series of provisions shows clearly that the whole operation had to remain inside the joint venture between Placer Dome and CVG, without the introduction by either party, through one device or another, of a new party without the consent of the other party.\n\n208.\n\nThough it was apparent that Placer Dome was actively seeking a new investor to step into the Las Cristinas project, it is not disputed that Placer Dome did not inform CVG of its intention to transfer its interests in PDV to Vannessa until a matter of hours before the expiry of the agreed period of suspension on July 15, 2001. Nor is it disputed that CVG had the right to terminate the Work Contract with MINCA in the event of any further unauthorized suspension. Further, it is evident that the termination of the Work Contract would have terminated the basis upon which Placer Dome had made its investment.\n\n209.\n\nIt is well established that, in order to amount to an expropriation under international law, it is necessary that the conduct of the State should go beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt.209 In the present case, although in 2002 various legal measures were adopted to cancel rights in respect of Las Cristinas, those measures were all consequent upon the initial termination of the Work Contract - as was the physical occupation of the Las Cristinas site by CVG.\n\n*See, e.g., Impregiio SpA v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005 (hereinafter, *Impregiio v. Pakistan),* \u00b6 260; *Consortium RFCC v. Kingdom of* *Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6, Award, December 22, 2003, \u00b6 51; ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary on Article 4, \u00b6 6.\n\n210.\n\nThe evidence points to the termination being a step for which CVG and Placer Dome had made contractual provision, motivated by the unauthorised continuation of the work suspension and the withdrawal of Placer Dome from its participation (via PDV) in the Las Cristinas project.210 Claimant has not shown that Respondent\u2019s actions were more than legitimate contractual responses to what the Tribunal considers to be contractual breaches.\n\nRespondent also cited the failure of MINCA to file reports as a reason for termination of the Work Contract. *See* Ex. C-109A, Ex. R-85.\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note that the notice of the breach,211 dated August 6, 2001, invokes three contractual breaches by MINCA: (1) the violation of its obligation to submit detailed reports to CVG; (2) the failure to resume work on the mine, after the expiration of the last extension on July 15, 2001; (3) the entry into a transaction with Claimant for the transfer of all of the shares of MINCA \"thus contravening express contractual provisions contained in Clause Twenty-fifth [in fact, Twenty Eighth] of the above referenced Contract [i.e., the Work Contract], by virtue whereof it was bound to obtain due written authorization by CVG therefor *in view of the scope such transfer has over MINCA....\"*\n\nEx. C-109A (emphasis added).\n\n212.\n\nThe three same violations were also asserted in the notice of cancellation of the Work Contract212 on 6 November 2001, after the lapse of the 90 day period given to Claimant to remedy the violations.\n\nEx. C-148A.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no evidence that termination was motivated by an intention to confer benefits upon CVG, Crystallex (with whom Respondent subsequently made an agreement concerning Las Cristinas), or any other entity.\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the termination of the Work Contract rises above the \"high threshold\"213 that separates a contractual dispute from a violation of a treaty prohibition on expropriation. The claim that Respondent has violated Article VII of the Canada-Venezuela BIT by the termination of the Work Contract and the steps consequential upon that termination is accordingly rejected.\n\n*Impregiio v. Pakistan,* \u00b6 267.\n\n215.\n\nAs to the taking of physical assets in the context of the November 2001 takeover of the Las Cristinas site,214 the Seventeenth Clause of the Work Contract provided that those assets would revert to Venezuela (or CVG) upon termination of the Contract:\n\nPermanent works done by the Company [MINCA], including facilities, accessories, equipment and any other goods acquired in ownership to be used for the exploration, development and exploitation subject hereof shall pass in full title to the Corporation [CVG], free of encumbrances and charges, and without any indemnity, once this Agreement terminates, whatever the cause.\n\nWhile the Seventeenth Clause of the Work Contract was modified on April 7, 1999215 to change the reference to \"the Corporation\" to \"the Nation,\" this change does not affect the analysis because, either way, Placer Dome had no right to them, and consequently Vannessa could have no right to claim damages for them.\n\n*See* \u00b6 100 above.\n\nEx. C-21A.\n\n**B. Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nClaimant\u2019s submissions regarding alleged violations of the provisions on fair and equitable treatment **(\"FET\")** and full protection and security **(\"FPS\"),** both contained in Article II(2) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT, are both considered in this section, although they are two distinct standards of protection of an investor\u2019s rights.\n\n*1. Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n217.\n\nClaimant claims a breach of the right to fair and equitable treatment through the unilateral termination by CVG of the Work Contract without first resorting to \"arbitration according to the Venezuelan Civil Procedural Code, performed in accordance with the arbitration rules of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris\" as provided in Clause Twenty Sixth of the Work Contract, and also in the conduct of CVG and the Venezuelan courts which, it says, prevented MINCA from commencing the ICC arbitration in respect of the contractual disputes.216 Claimant rejects Respondent\u2019s argument that MINCA itself had failed to present a case to the ICC and instead chose to pursue a process of \"formalisation\" of arbitration before the Venezuelan courts, arguing that the formalisation process was required by the applicable rules of the Venezuelan Civil Procedure Code. Claimant says that CVG had explicitly rejected the possibility of arbitrating disputes in respect of (allegedly) administrative contracts. More broadly, Claimant argues that it was mistreated by the judicial system because delays and dismissals of its claims by courts, which were less than independent and impartial and were acting against the background of political controversy, had the effect of denying its right to arbitration.217 Claimant also invokes its reasonable and legitimate expectations that CVG would respect the contractual right to go to arbitration.218\n\nTr. Day 2:291-305 (Terry).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 190-208; Claimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 551-64.\n\nTr. Day 4:837-38 (Terry). For a broader view, *see* Tr. Day 2:314-19 (Terry).\n\n218.\n\nClaimant considers that the standard of FPS applies to the protection by the State of foreign investments from actions of the State\u2019s officials and agencies. Claimant argues that Respondent failed to provide full protection and security to its investment by not exercising due diligence in protecting Claimant from injurious acts of Respondent\u2019s officials and agencies. Claimant argues that \"full protection and security\" is not limited to cases involving civil strife and also applies to a situation such as that in the present dispute. In particular, Claimant argues that: the Ministry of Energy and Mines failed to exercise its obligations of supervision and control in respect of the Las Cristinas project; the Venezuelan *Fiscal\u00eda* failed to properly investigate the unlawful expropriations of Claimant\u2019s rights; and the National Assembly committees failed to properly investigate its complaints.219\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply \u00b6\u00b6 565-74. *See also* Tr. Day 2:319-20 (Terry).\n\n*2. Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n219.\n\nRespondent denies that it breached the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. It argues that Claimant\u2019s position is fundamentally flawed in two respects: first, MINCA itself prevented the Venezuelan courts from ordering arbitration, by the procedures that it chose to pursue before those courts; secondly, MINCA never tried to initiate the arbitration with the ICC. More broadly, Claimant\u2019s arguments, even if true, would not satisfy \"[t]he standard for denial of justice [that] requires evidently arbitrary, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory acts.\"220 In the oral proceedings, Respondent rejected Claimant\u2019s arguments about its legitimate expectations as being vague and unsubstantiated.221\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 813. *See generally* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 792-832; Tr. Day 3:605-14 (Hodgson).\n\nTr. Day 3:564-69 (Goodman); Tr. Day 3:585-87 (Hodgson).\n\n220.\n\nRespondent considers that the FPS standard is in principle limited to the duty of the State to protect investors against physical violence, and notes the uncertainty about the application of the standard outside the context of protection from physical violence.222 Respondent says that it has not denied full protection and security to Claimant. In any event, it says that the Ministry of Energy and Mines did not have any obligation to prevent CVG from exercising its contractual rights, and that the events alleged could not establish a breach of an obligation to protect.223 Claimant did not have any right to an investigation by the *Fiscal\u00eda* or any right to have committees of the National Assembly investigate its complaints.224\n\nTr. Day 3:615-17 (Hodgson).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 833-48; Tr. Day 3:618-19 (Hodgson).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 849-53; Tr. Day 3:614-15 (Hodgson).\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n----------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the decision to terminate the Work Contract, and the consequent steps to take over the Las Cristinas site and to bring rights in respect of Las Cristinas under the control of Respondent, did not amount to an expropriation. They were contractual responses to what the Tribunal considers to be contractual breaches. The questions here are whether Respondent violated the Treaty by treating the investment unfairly or inequitably, and whether there was any failure to accord full protection and security to the investment.\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that there are different formulations of the precise content of the FET standard, but observes that they all have in common the requirement that the standard does not guarantee the success or profitability of an investment but requires that the treatment of investments not fall below a minimum standard of fairness and equitableness that all investors have a right to expect. The Tribunal agrees that in this case the treatment of Claimant\u2019s investment by Respondent, in light of the manner in which the investment was made and of the contractual framework that had been agreed for the development of Las Cristinas, cannot be regarded as falling below that minimum standard, however the standard might be formulated in its precise details.\n\n223.\n\nSimilarly, as far as the content of the FPS standard is concerned, the Tribunal is broadly in agreement that it applies at least in situations where actions of third parties involving either physical violence or the disregard of legal rights occur, and requires that the State exercise due diligence to prevent harm to the investor, it being understood that the FPS standard does not grant the investor an \"insurance against all and every risk.\" While members of the Tribunal do not consider that there is a more precise formulation of the content of the standard that is universally accepted,225 they are in agreement that even the most demanding formulation of the FPS standard for which Claimant contended was not violated in the present case.\n\nFor example, the different approaches in *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN 3467, Award, July 1, 2004, \u00b6\u00b6 183-87, and in *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 522-23 both command support.\n\n224.\n\nMore specifically, the Tribunal does not accept that the termination of the Work Contract without first resorting to arbitration constitutes a violation of either the right to fair and equitable treatment or the right to full protection and security.\n\n225.\n\nHaving considered the evidence concerning Venezuelan law that was put before it, the Tribunal is not persuaded that arbitration was an essential precondition to termination of the contract, although under Clause Twenty Sixth of the Work Contract arbitration was plainly an option for the resolution of disputes arising out of the termination of the contract.\n\n226.\n\nFurthermore, in the view of the Tribunal, Claimant has not proved its claim that Respondent has violated Claimant\u2019s right to fair and equitable treatment or its right to full protection and security under the BIT by obstructing the access of Claimant to the Venezuelan courts or to arbitration in order to pursue its claims. It is true that in the ten sets of proceedings listed above226 there are instances in which the Venezuelan Courts failed to deal promptly, or at all, with applications for interim relief; and it is true that there were considerable delays in dealing with many of the applications. The Tribunal does not, however, consider that the delays are of an order that violates Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Treaty.\n\n*See* \u00b6 103 above.\n\n227.\n\nTribunals in other cases have pointed to the high threshold in this regard. In *Waste Management,* the award referred to \"a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice.\"227 The Tribunal considers that to be the correct approach. The question is not whether the host State legal system is performing as efficiently as it ideally could: it is whether it is performing so badly as to violate treaty obligations to accord fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The Tribunal does not consider that the delays in this case are of an order that constitute conduct that falls below the minimum standard demanded by the Treaty.\n\n*Waste Management v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, \u00b6 98. *Cf.,* *Loewen Group v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, June 26, 2003, \u00b6 132; *Alex Genin v. The Republic of Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award, June 25, 2001, \u00b6371.\n\n228.\n\nAllegations of a lack of independence and impartiality are more difficult to deal with. They often amount to allegations of violations of professional rules, or even of criminal laws, and it is not to be expected that evidence will be readily available. Such allegations would, if proven, constitute very serious violations of the State\u2019s treaty obligations. But they must be properly proved; and the proof must, at least ordinarily, relate to the specific cases in which the impropriety is alleged to have occurred. Inferences of a serious and endemic lack of independence and impartiality in the judiciary, drawn from an examination of other cases or from anecdotal or circumstantial evidence, will not ordinarily suffice to prove an allegation of impropriety in a particular case. The evidence in this case does not warrant a conclusion that the decisions of the courts in Venezuela in the proceedings instituted by Claimant demonstrate a lack of independence or impartiality, and the Tribunal does not accept that they amount to breaches of either the right to fair and equitable treatment or the right to full protection and security.\n\n229.\n\nAs far as concerns Claimant\u2019s submissions concerning access to ICC arbitration are concerned, the Tribunal notes that Claimant did not file an application directly with the ICC, but chose to seek an order from the Venezuelan courts that CVG must accept ICC arbitration. Claimant had also sought to litigate various aspects of the dispute before the Venezuelan courts, but eventually decided to waive its right to continue its proceedings before the Venezuelan courts in order to pursue the present arbitration. Such a waiver is a necessary precondition of access to arbitration under the Canada-Venezuela BIT, stipulated by Article XII(3)(b). That provision also requires that Claimant waive its rights to initiate or continue \"a dispute settlement procedure of any kind\" to which the dispute has been referred. The right to ICC arbitration had, therefore, to be waived in order that Claimant could bring the case before this Tribunal.\n\n230.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes that a three-year time limit is imposed by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT, in respect to arbitration under the Treaty. Access to this Tribunal is an agreed alternative to the pursuit of remedies in national courts or in contractual arbitrations, in relation to complaints of conduct that is alleged to amount to a violation of the Treaty.\n\n231.\n\nClaimant did not support its allegations that its treatment by Respondent was discriminatory. No evidence of dissimilar treatment of investors in a position similar to that of Claimant was adduced. Similarly, no further evidence to support the allegation of a breach of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" provision or the \"full protection and security\" provision in the BIT was adduced. The Tribunal does not consider that Claimant has substantiated either allegation.\n\n232.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that there has been no violation of the duty to accord Claimant\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment or the duty to accord it full protection and security under the BIT.\n\n**III. CONCLUSION**\n-------------------\n\n233.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Tribunal concludes that there has been no violation of the rights of Claimant under the Canada-Venezuela BIT.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal having found that there has been no violation of Claimant\u2019s rights under the BIT, the question of costs remains. The Decision on Jurisdiction reserved the allocation of costs for later determination, and the Tribunal accordingly has to decide on the allocation of costs for both the jurisdiction and the merits phases of this case.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties employed outside counsel and experts. It notes further that the total costs exceeded US $20 million and that Claimant\u2019s costs were under one-half of Respondent\u2019s costs. While it understands the magnitude of the issues at stake, and that each Party took its own decisions on how best to protect its interests, the Tribunal considers it regrettable that the costs of what should be an efficient and reasonably expeditious procedure are so high.\n\n236.\n\nIn this case, Claimant was in effect the winner of the jurisdiction phase and the loser of the merits phase of this case. Given the logistics of case preparation and the extent to which issues are intertwined, it is practically impossible to separate out the costs of the two phases. Taking account of the extent to which each side has prevailed, and the respective expenditures of each Party, the Tribunal has decided that each side should bear its own costs and one-half of the costs of the Tribunal and of ICSID.\n\n**V. DISPOSITIF**\n-----------------\n\n237.\n\nFor the above reasons, and pursuant to Article 52 of the Arbitration Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\ni) by a majority rejects the objections to jurisdiction made by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and decides that it has jurisdiction to determine the dispute;\n\nii) unanimously dismisses all of the claims made by Claimant against Respondent under the Canada-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty in this case, summarized in paragraph 344 of Claimant\u2019s Memorial and paragraph 639 of Claimant\u2019s Reply; and\n\niii) unanimously decides that each Party shall bear its own costs and one-half of the costs of the Tribunal and of ICSID."}]}
