INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in the present arbitration is WA Investments-Europa Nova Limited (\"**WA Investments**\", \"**WAIEN**\", or the \"**Claimant**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Cyprus, with its registered address in Diomidous Street, 10, Alphamega-Akropolis Building, 3rd floor, Flat/Office 401, 2024 Nicosia, Cyprus. The Claimant is represented in the proceedings by Prof. Luca G. Radicati di Brozolo, Avv. Michele Sabatini, Mr. Emilio Bettoni, and Mr. Flavio Ponzano of ARBLIT- Radicati di Brozolo Sabatini Benedettelli, Via Alberto da Giussano, 15, 20145 Milan, Italy.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Government of the Czech Republic, a sovereign State (the \"**Government**\", or the \"**Respondent**\", and together with the Claimant, the \"**Parties**\"). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Paolo Di Rosa of Arnold & Porter LLP, 601 Massachusetts Avenue NQ, Washington, D.C. 20001-3743, United States; Mr. Dimitri Evseev of Arnold & Porter LLP, Tower 42, 25 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1HQ, United Kingdom; Ms. Karol\u00edna Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 and Libor Mor\u00e1vek of Skils s.r.o. advok\u00e1tn\u00ed kancel\u00e1r, K\u0159i\u017eovnick\u00e9 nam. 193/2 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic; and by Ms. Marie Tala\u0161ov\u00e1, Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic.\n\n**B. BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe proceedings arise out of an investment made by the Claimant in the photovoltaic sector in the Czech Republic. A dispute has arisen between WAIEN and the Government in respect of the alleged cancellation of the legal, tax, and regulatory incentive regime that had previously been established by the Czech Government in the photovoltaic sector.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant has commenced arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the Cyprus Republic and the Government of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 15 June 2001 (the \"**BIT**\"), and the Energy Charter Treaty of 16 April 1998 (the \"**ECT**\").\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, the Claimant, together with nine other investors, jointly filed a single Notice of Arbitration for a multi-party arbitration.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant designated Prof. Luca Radicati di Brozolo and Mr. Michele Sabatini of Bonelli Erede Pappalardo Studio Legale (Milan) as its lead counsel. While these attorneys left Bonelli Erede Pappalardo Studio Legale and established ARBLIT in October 2013, they have been serving as counsel for the Claimant throughout the proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent initially designated Professor Zachary Douglas (Matrix Chambers), Mr. David W. Alexander (Squire Sanders (US) LLP, Columbus), Mr. Stephen P. Anway (Squire Sanders (US) LLP, New York) and Ms. Karolina Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 (Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, Prague) as its counsel. At a later stage of the proceedings, Professor Zachary Douglas withdrew from the representation, and Mr. David W. Alexander and Mr. Stephen P. Anway were replaced by Mr. Paolo Di Rosa (Arnold & Porter LLP, Washington DC) and Mr. Dimitri Evseev (Arnold & Porter (UK) LLP, London) (*see* paragraphs 59 and 61). Ms. Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1's law firm changed its business name to Skils s.r.o. advok\u00e1tn\u00ed kancel\u00e1\u0159.\n\n8.\n\nOn 10 June 2013, the Respondent replied to the Claimant, noting that they understood the Notice of Arbitration to be an invitation to consent to the consolidation of the claims. The Respondent proceeded to split the proceedings into six different arbitrations, and appointed Judge Peter Tomka, Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC, and Mr. Toby Landau QC as its party-nominated arbitrators.\n\n9.\n\nOn 24 June 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent stating that this was a multi-party arbitration and not a case of consolidation.\n\n10.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant, challenging this classification, stating that there is \"no single arbitration agreement in existence that is capable of extending to all the different claims based upon different treaty obligations in different international instruments.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn 5 July 2013, the Claimant requested the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\" or \"**Registry**\") to designate an appointing authority (\"**AA**\") pursuant to Article 6(2) of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010, to complete the constitution of a single arbitral tribunal and to proceed to take a decision on the competence of the tribunal, in light of the lack of agreement between the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nOn 9 July 2013, by a letter to the PCA Secretary-General, the Respondent challenged the Claimant's request to designate an AA, alleging that in the present case, no power had been conferred on the Secretary-General under the Rules to make arbitral appointments. The Respondent further argued that the Notice of Arbitration was invalid, because it invoked the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules instead of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Respondent stressed that \"there is no single arbitration agreement in existence that could possibly give a single arbitral tribunal authority over all the 10 claimants, their alleged investments, and their claims under the distinct international instruments.\"\n\n13.\n\nBy the Respondent's letter of 9 July 2013 and the Claimant's letter of 22 July 2013, the Parties agreed that the present arbitration shall be governed by the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n14.\n\nOn 13 August 2013, the Secretary-General declined to act upon the Claimant's request, owing to the lack of a basis under the UNCITRAL Rules justifying the Secretary-General's intervention. This was because first, appointing authorities had been agreed in advance in some of the instruments invoked by the Claimant, and secondly, because the Respondent had actively participated in the proceedings and responded to the Notice of Arbitration in a timely manner by appointing the second arbitrator.\n\n**B. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, the Claimant appointed Mr. Raymond Doak Bishop as the first arbitrator.\n\n16.\n\nOn 10 June 2013, the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby Landau QC as the second arbitrator.\n\n17.\n\nOn 17 March 2014, the co-arbitrators appointed Professor Hans van Houtte as the President of the Tribunal, thereby duly constituting the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, having learned that his firm had been recently engaged in other matters that potentially involved issues similar to those in this arbitration, and citing grounds of a perception of bias, Mr. Doak Bishop tendered his resignation from the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nOn 5 August 2014, the Claimant was requested to appoint a new arbitrator to replace Mr. Bishop as a Tribunal member, pursuant to Articles 7(1) and 13(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal suspended the proceedings until the appointment of a new co-arbitrator.\n\n20.\n\nOn 24 September 2014, the Claimant appointed Mr. Gary Born as its party-nominated arbitrator.\n\n**C. COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND PLACE OF ARBITRATION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 22 April 2014, the Claimant submitted its individual Notice of Arbitration to the Respondent. This date is deemed as the formal date for the commencement of the present proceedings pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant proposed Geneva, Switzerland as the legal seat of the present arbitration, but indicated that it would also accept Paris, France as the legal seat of arbitration in the event that the Tribunal selected a seat of arbitration within the European Union.\n\n22.\n\nOn 23 May 2014, the Respondent submitted a **Response to Claimant's Notice of Arbitration** by which it raised its objections to jurisdiction, and set out its version of the factual background to the dispute. In addition, the Respondent proposed Paris, France as the legal seat of the present arbitration.\n\n23.\n\nOn 15 July 2014, by **Procedural Order No. 1**, the Tribunal established that the place of arbitration would be Paris, France.\n\n24.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the Claimant submitted its **Motion to Transfer the Seat of Arbitration**, from Paris to Geneva, citing the request of the European Commission for leave to intervene, as well as actions taken by it and EU courts in other unrelated arbitrations as presenting grounds for transferring the seat of arbitration to a non-EU country.\n\n25.\n\nOn 12 November 2014, the Respondent submitted its objections to the Claimant's Motion to Transfer the Seat of Arbitration, raising the absence of reasons compelling a change of the seat.\n\n26.\n\nOn 27 February 2015, in its **Procedural Order No. 2**, the Tribunal ordered that the place of arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n**D. EUROPEAN COMMISSION INTERVENTION****, AND CONFIDENTIALITY**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, the European Commission (the \"**EC**\") submitted an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party.\n\n28.\n\nOn 15 July 2014, in its **Procedural Order No. 1**, the Tribunal, with the agreement of the Parties, appointed the Permanent Court of Arbitration as the administering authority in the proceedings. By the same order, the Tribunal set out the procedural timetable applicable to the proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 contained the following provision on confidentiality:\n\n\"Either Party may publicly disclose submissions made in these proceedings unless there has been a decision by the Tribunal to the contrary. Requests for confidential treatment of any item communicated in these proceedings may be submitted by either Party to the Tribunal for a decision, in which case no item which is the subject of such request may be publicly disclosed unless and until the Tribunal has decided upon such application.\"\n\n30.\n\nOn 17 July 2014, the Claimant submitted its comments on Procedural Order No. 1, including an objection to the confidentiality provisions, on the grounds that \"the issue of confidentiality ha[d] not been discussed or agreed upon by the Parties\", nor had there been any agreement on the applicability of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitrations. The Claimant also raised the point regarding the choice of seat of arbitration in a European country, highlighting that the Respondent had waived the \"Intra-European Union BIT objection\", and stating that the Commission's objection on this ground raised \"serious doubts as to the transparency of the Respondent's behaviour.\"\n\n31.\n\nOn 30 July 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to address by 8 August 2014 the Claimant's letter of 17 July 2014, asking it to \"specifically elaborate[e] on the possible inconsistency with confidentiality obligations in related matters and on its possible public law obligations of transparency that may be applicable.\" The Tribunal also invited the Claimant to submit its response, by 18 August 2014, to the Respondent's submission and to the Respondent's letter of 29 July 2014. The Tribunal stressed that confidentiality should be maintained until the Tribunal decided on the matter.\n\n32.\n\nOn 8 August 2014, the Respondent stated that due to the suspension of proceedings by virtue of Mr. Doak Bishop's resignation from the Tribunal, it would submit its response to the Claimant's letter of 17 July 2014, as soon as the proceedings were reinstituted.\n\n33.\n\nOn 11 August 2014, the President of the Tribunal advised that the Respondent's response should be submitted within one week of the appointment of the new arbitrator.\n\n34.\n\nOn 26 September 2014, following the appointment of Mr. Gary Born as the Claimant-appointed arbitrator, the Tribunal notified the Parties of the resumption of proceedings, and set the new date for submissions on the request from the EC for Leave to Intervene as 3 October 2014.\n\n35.\n\nOn 3 October 2014, the Respondent provided its response to the Claimant's letter of 17 July 2014.\n\n36.\n\nOn 7 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its comments on the EC's Application for Leave to Intervene by 20 October 2014. The Tribunal also ordered that the \"Simultaneous Cross-Requests for Production of Documents\", which were originally due by 20 August 2014, would now be due by 27 October 2014.\n\n37.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the Claimant submitted its **Comments on the EC's Intervention**.\n\n38.\n\nBy **Procedural Order No. 2**, dated 27 February 2015, and pursuant to Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal (with a Concurring Opinion from Mr. Gary Born) granted the EC leave to intervene as *amicus curiae*, subject to the condition that the Commission undertake, prior to consideration of its submissions, to pay in full the reasonable costs of all Parties resulting from the submissions.\n\n39.\n\nOn 6 March 2015, the Registry communicated Mr. Gary Born's Concurring Opinion to the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 2. Mr. Gary Born expressed serious reservations, stating that it is \"exceedingly difficult [\u2026] fairly to conclude that the Tribunal has the authority, over one party's objections, to permit a non-party to participate in the arbitral process.\" However, he added that bearing in mind the interest of consistency and predictability in arbitral decisions, he was persuaded to grant the EC leave to intervene, subject to appropriate conditions.\n\n40.\n\nOn 8 April 2015, the EC submitted a Written *Amicus Curiae* Submission.\n\n41.\n\nOn 8 April 2015, the EC also submitted an application to vary Procedural Order No. 2, to reconsider the condition concerning the undertakings on costs.\n\n42.\n\nOn 9 April 2015, the Tribunal dismissed the EC's application to vary Procedural Order No. 2. The Commission was granted a further opportunity to make the required undertaking on costs by Wednesday, 15 April 2015, and notified that, if the required undertaking was not provided by that date, the EC's *amicus curiae* submission would be disallowed.\n\n43.\n\nOn 14 April 2015, the EC stated that it was not in a position to provide the undertaking as required by the Tribunal. Accordingly, its *amicus curiae* submissions were disallowed.\n\n**E. DISCLOSURE BETWEEN TRIBUNALS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 8 December 2014, the Tribunal enquired whether the Parties would be willing to accept that the Tribunal should be informed of rulings made in the parallel proceedings involving the Respondent (PCA Case Nos. 2013-35 and 2014-1), on issues which also arise in one or more of the four proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\n45.\n\nOn 10 December 2014, the Respondent responded to the Tribunal's enquiry, stating that, subject to appropriate undertakings from the Tribunal, it would be prepared to agree to the Tribunal's suggestion.\n\n46.\n\nOn 12 December 2014, the Claimant expressed its agreement that the Tribunal may have access to the decisions in the parallel proceedings. The Claimant added that a simple agreement of the Parties was sufficient in the circumstances, and that no further agreements were required.\n\n47.\n\nOn 17 December 2014, the Respondent proposed that the Parties in the present proceedings, as well as the nine other claimants in the parallel cases, sign a written agreement \"regulating the process of disclosure of the Rulings and the scope of waiver of confidentiality in the other proceedings\".\n\n48.\n\nOn 27 December 2014, the Claimant sent a draft proposal for a Disclosure Agreement in the parallel proceedings, to the Respondent.\n\n49.\n\nOn 6 January 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant's proposal.\n\n50.\n\nOn 15 January 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of the Parties' agreed procedures for disclosure regarding the Rulings in PCA Cases Nos. 2013-35, 2014-1, 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22, contained in the Disclosure Agreement.\n\n51.\n\nOn 16 January 2015, the Tribunal communicated its general consent to the disclosure of its Rulings in the parallel proceedings on the conditions specified in the Disclosure Agreement.\n\n52.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, the arbitral tribunal in PCA Case No. 2013-35 communicated electronic copies of Procedural Order No. 4 of 24 November 2014 and the Concurring Opinion of Mr. Born, to the Tribunal in the present proceedings.\n\n53.\n\nOn 27 March 2015, the Parties jointly proposed an amended procedural calendar to the Tribunal, which was approved by the Tribunal on 30 March 2015.\n\n**F.

STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE INCENTIVE REGIME FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES (\"RES REGIME\")**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIn 1992, the Czech Republic adopted Act No. 586/1992 on Income Tax (\"**Act on Income Tax**\"), which, according to the Claimant, was the first legislative step encouraging the use of renewable energy sources (\"**RES**\"), including photovoltaic plants. Through the Act on Income Tax, the Czech Republic implemented two relevant tax incentives. The first exempted RES producers from corporate income tax for the year in which the respective solar facility was put into operation and the following five calendar years (\"**Tax Holiday**\").16 The second incentive introduced an accelerated depreciation period for tax purposes for certain components of, *inter alia*, photovoltaic installations.17\n\nArticle 19(1)(d), Act No. 586/1992 **(Ex. C-18** / **R-1)**. The English translations of the original sources in Czech submitted by the Parties differ. Where they differ, the Tribunal quoted from the English translation that is the most clear and comprehensive.\n\nAct No. 586/1992, Section 30 and Annex 1 **(Ex. R-61a)**.\n\n131.\n\nIn December 1995, the EC (then called \"the Commission of the European Communities\") published a white paper on the \"Energy Policy for the European Union\", which aimed at encouraging the promotion of RES through tax benefits and other measures.18 In November 1997, the EC published another white paper entitled \"Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy\" stating that \"[a] long-term stable framework for the development of renewable sources of energy, covering political, legislative, administrative, economic and marketing aspects is in fact the top priority for the economic operators involved in their development.\"19\n\nWhite Paper: An Energy Policy for the European Union, COM (95) 682, December 1995 **(Ex. C-19)**.\n\nWhite Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan COM (97) 599, November 1997 **(Ex. C-203)**.\n\n132.\n\nOn 27 September 2001, following the publication of the two white papers, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced by RES in the internal electricity market (\"**2001 Directive**\"), aiming \"to promote an increase in the contribution of [RES] to electricity production in the internal market for electricity and to create a basis for a future Community framework thereof.\"20 In light of this objective, EU Member States were required to \"take appropriate steps to encourage greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in conformity with [\u2026] national indicative targets\"21 and to \"adopt and publish a report setting national indicative targets for future consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in terms of percentage of electricity consumption for the next ten years.\"22 The 2001 Directive also obliged Member States to \"outline the measures taken or planned, at the national level, to achieve these national indicative targets\" and to publish their success in meeting the targets.23 The Annex to the 2001 Directive set out \"[r]eference values for Member States' national indicative targets for the contribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources to gross electricity consumption by 2010.\"24\n\nArticle 1, Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market **(Ex. C-20)**.\n\nArticle 3(1), 2001 Directive **(Ex. C-20)**.\n\nArticle 3(2), 2001 Directive **(Ex. C-20)**.\n\nArticle 3(3), 2001 Directive **(Ex. C-20)**.\n\nAnnex, 2001 Directive **(Ex. C-20)**.\n\n133.\n\nIn late 2003, the Czech Republic prepared draft legislation that was aimed at increasing the support provided to RES producers.25 An explanatory report on the draft legislation was dated 12 November 2003 (\"**Explanatory Report**\").26 The draft legislation was eventually adopted in March 2005 as Act No. 180/2005 Coll. (\"**Act on Promotion**\"). While not yet an EU Member State, the Czech Republic was already under an obligation to comply with EU law, including rules on State aid. On 16 December 2003, the Czech Society for Wind Energy and the Czech national section of the European Association for Renewable Energy (\"**EUROSOLAR**\") filed a complaint with the EC in respect of the 2003 draft of the Act on Promotion in view of its alleged incompatibility with EU State aid law.27\n\nMemorial, para. 37; Counter-Memorial, para. 13.\n\nExplanatory Report on the bill of the Act on Promotion, 12 November 2003 (extended version) (**Ex. C-****78**).\n\nMemorial, para. 40, *referring to* Letters from the Czech Society of Wind Energy EUROSOLAR respectively to Mr. Monti and Mr. Loyola de Palacio, 16 December 2003 **(Ex. C-75)**.\n\n134.\n\nOn 27 July 2004, having examined the complaint, the EC informed EUROSOLAR that the 2003 draft of the Act on Promotion, as it then was, \"does not fall under the definition of State aid within the meaning of Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty\".28 The last paragraph of the letter read: \"Should you learn of any new particulars that might demonstrate the existence of an infringement of the State aid rules, I would be grateful if you would inform my department as soon as possible\".29\n\nMemorial, para. 42, *referring to* Letter from the EC to EUROSOLAR, 27 July 2004 **(Ex. C-77)**.\n\nLetter from the EC to EUROSOLAR, 27 July 2004 **(Ex. C-77)**.\n\n135.\n\nUpon its accession to the EU, on 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic assumed all obligations deriving from EU legal instruments, including the 2001 Directive. In particular, Annex II \u2013 Energy, Part A of the 2003 EU Accession Treaty set the Czech Republic's national target for the contribution of electricity produced from RES to the gross electricity consumption by 2010 at 8% (\"**Indicative 2010 Target**\").30\n\nAnnex II \u2013 Energy, Part A of the 2003 EU Accession Treaty **(Ex. C-22)**.\n\n136.\n\nOn 31 March 2005, the Czech Republic adopted the Act on Promotion, which entered into force on 1 August 2005.31 Section 1(2) of the Act on Promotion defined its objectives as follows:\n\n**Section 1**\n\n**Subject Matter of Regulation**\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(2) The aim of this Act is to, in the interest of climate protection and environmental protection,\n\na) promote the exploitation of renewable energy sources (\"Renewable Sources\"),\n\nb) ensure that the share of Renewable Sources in the consumption of primary energy sources continually increases,\n\nc) contribute to conservation in the exploitation of natural resources and to the sustainable development of society,\n\nd) put in place the conditions for achieving the indicative target so that the share of electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity consumption in the Czech Republic in 2010 and to put in place the conditions for further increasing such share after 2010.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 21, *referring to* Act on Promotion (**Ex. R-5)**.\n\n137.\n\nThe Act on Promotion introduced new incentives for RES producers through a combination of tariff and non-tariff mechanisms including: (1) preferential treatment of RES producers in the distribution or transmission of electricity, (2) fixed purchase prices or Feed-in-Tariffs (\"**FiT**\") and, alternatively, (3) Green Bonuses (\"**Green Bonuses**\", and together with the FiT, \"**Subsidies**\" or \"**Tariffs**\").32\n\nMemorial, para. 63, *referring to* Act No. 180/2005 Coll., 31 March 2005, on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources and amending certain acts **(Ex. C-26)**.\n\n138.\n\nThe preferential treatment of RES producers in the distribution or transmission of electricity enshrined in Section 4 of the Act on Promotion, provided, *inter alia*, for the obligation of the transmission grid operator and distribution system operators \"to connect the facilities [\u2026] to the transmission grid or distribution systems on a priority basis for the purpose of transmission or distribution of electricity from [RES]\", if a RES producer requests them to do so.33\n\nSection 4(1), Act on Promotion **(Ex. R-5)**.\n\n139.\n\nThe FiT system obliged grid operators to purchase all electricity produced from RES on a priority basis and at a price annually determined by the Czech Energy Regulatory Office (\"**ERO**\").34\n\nMemorial, para. 65; Counter-Memorial, para. 21.\n\n140.\n\nThese tariff incentives were established by Section 6 of the Act on Promotion, which reads:\n\n**Section 6**\n\n**Amounts of Prices for Electricity from Renewable Sources and**\n\n**Amounts of Green Bonuses**\n\n(1) The Office sets, one calendar year in advance, the purchasing prices for electricity from Renewable Sources (the \"Purchasing Prices\"), separately for individual kinds of Renewable Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that\n\na) the conditions are created for the achievement of the indicative target so that the share of electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity consumption in 2010 and\n\nb) for facilities commissioned\n\n1. after the effective date of this Act, there is attained, with the Support consisting of the Purchasing Prices, a fifteen year payback period on capital expenditures, provided technical and economic parameters are met, such parameters consisting of, in particular, cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation efficiency of the primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the facility, such parameters being stipulated in an implementing legal regulation,\n\n2. after the effective date of this Act, the amount of revenues per unit of electricity from Renewable Sources, assuming Support in the form of Purchasing Prices, is maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues], for a period of 15 years from the commissioning year of the facility, taking into account the industrial producer price index; the commissioning of a facility is also deemed to include cases involving the completion of a rebuild of the technological part of existing equipment, a change of fuel, or the completion of modernization that raises the technical and ecological standard of an existing facility,\n\n3. prior to the effective date of this Act, there is maintained for a period of 15 years the minimum amount of Purchasing Prices set for the year 2005 in accordance with the legal regulations to date and taking into account the industrial producer price index.\n\n(2) When setting the amounts of green bonuses, the Office also takes into account a heightened degree of risk associated with off-taking electricity from Renewable Sources in the electricity market.\n\n(3) When setting Purchasing Prices and green bonuses, the Office proceeds on the basis of differing costs for the acquisition, connection and operation of individual types of facilities, including the development thereof [the development of such costs] over time.\n\n(4) Purchasing Prices set by the Office for the following calendar year shall not be less than 95% of the Purchasing Prices in effect in the year for which the setting decision is made. The provision of the first sentence shall not be used for setting the Purchasing Prices for the following calendar year for those types of Renewable Sources where the payback period on capital expenditures is shorter than 11 years in the calendar year in which the Office decides on the setting of the new Purchase Prices; When setting Purchase Prices, the Office proceeds in accordance with subsections 1 through 3.\n\n141.\n\nThus, pursuant to Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, RES producers were projected to recover their investment in RES plants within 15 years, provided that the installations met certain \"technical and economic parameters\", including \"cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation efficiency of the primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the facility.\" Article 6 of the Act on Promotion also introduced two restrictions on the ability of the ERO to change the tariffs. First, Article 6(1)(b)(2) provided that the established FiT would remain the same for a period of 15 years subject to the industrial producer price index.35 Second, under Article 6(4) of the Act on Promotion, the FiT set by the ERO in any given year was not allowed to be decreased by more than 5% of the value of the FiT in the previous year (\"**5% rule**\").36\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 21:4-6, 197:19-24.\n\nMemorial, paras. 67-68; Counter-Memorial, para. 28.\n\n142.\n\nIn the same year in which the Act on Promotion entered into force, various governmental officials and entities of the Czech Republic promoted the Incentive Regime for RES producers and emphasised the importance of the guaranteed electricity purchase price on several occasions.37 In particular, Mr. Martin Burs\u00edk, one of the co-authors of the Act on Promotion, who became Minister of Environment from 2007 to 2009, stated in his article dated 1 June 2005 that the most important principle of the Act on Promotion was \"the guarantee of a stable feed-in tariff for a 15-year period following the launch of the power station into operation.\"38\n\nMemorial, paras. 89-99, *referring to* The State will support renewable energy, 23 February 2005 **(Ex.

(\"**Pricing Regulation**\"), Article 2(9) of which provided for an annual increase of the FiT:\n\nFeed-in tariffs and Green bonuses stipulated by the Act on Promotion are applied throughout the estimated lifetime of plants determined by the regulation implementing some provisions of the Act on Promotion. The Feed-in tariffs increase annually throughout the lifetime of the plant classified in the respective category depending on the type of the renewable resource used and the date of launch into operation with respect to the industrial producers' price index by a minimum of 2% and maximum of 4%, with the exception of biomass and bio gas burning plants.45\n\nERO Regulation No. 149/2009 Coll., Article 2(9) **(Ex. C-31)**.\n\n147.\n\nThe above regulation thus established that payment of the FiT and Green Bonuses was guaranteed throughout the estimated lifetime of photovoltaic power plants and the FiT was to increase annually by a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 4% \"taking into account the inflation price index for industrial producers over the lifetime of the plant.\"46\n\nMemorial, paras. 82-83, *referring to* ERO Regulation No. 140/2009 Coll., Article 2(9) (**Ex. C-31**).\n\n148.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the ERO was still promoting the Incentive Regime at the beginning of 2008. On 27 February 2008, Mr. Rostislav Krejcar, the ERO's head of department for RES, made a presentation on the Incentive Regime, which was attended by Mr. Pavel \u010capek, who was employed by the Claimant as Chief Technology Officer in charge of the solar projects.47 The presentation stated, *inter alia,* that \"purchase prices and green bonuses are applied throughout the life time of electricity producers [\u2026] photovoltaic power [*plants*] 20 years (since 1.1.2008)\" and that \"[d]uring the life time of electricity production plant the purchase prices shall be increased with regards to increasing the Industrial Producers' Price Index at least by 2% and a maximum of 4%, with the exception of biomass and biogas\".48\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Ji\u0159\u00ed Chroustovsk\u00fd, dated 15 June 2015 (\"**First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**\"), paras. 13, 34, *referring to* ERO Presentation by Mr. Rostislav Krejcar, 27 February 2008 (**Annex XIII to First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**).\n\nERO Presentation by Mr. Rostislav Krejcar, 27 February 2008, slide 7 (**Annex XIII to First Chroustovsk\u00fd****Statement**).\n\n149.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Act on Promotion, the relevant ERO regulations and the Act on Income Tax jointly established the incentive regime, which offered investments in the photovoltaic sector the FiT or alternatively Green Bonuses, the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period (the \"**Incentive Regime**\").49 The Respondent has a different understanding, namely that the regime provided by the Czech Republic was not photovoltaic-focused. According to this view, while the Act on Promotion and the relevant ERO regulations provided an incentive scheme as to the entire RES by granting either the FiT or the Green Bonuses, the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period did not constitute part of it.\n\nReply, paras. 6-10.\n\n150.\n\nOn 15 October 2009, Mr. Krejcar delivered another presentation concerning the Incentive Regime. Although it is unclear whether this presentation was attended by any of the Claimant's representatives or employees, the information contained therein was made available to the Claimant.50 That presentation is depicted by the Respondent as a warning to the investors regarding the upcoming changes in the Incentive Regime.51 In particular, the presentation stated that \"the economic return [\u2026] at the current prices is in conflict with the guaranteed return pursuant to the law and is almost half\" of the 15-year period.52 At the same time, as noted by the Claimant, the presentation provided that \"[p]urchase prices and green bonuses are applied for the entire estimated useful life of power plants\", similarly to the abovementioned ERO presentation in February 2008.53\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr. Ji\u0159\u00ed Chroustovsk\u00fd, dated 30 March June 2016 (\"**Second Chroustovsk\u00fd****Statement**\"), para. 10.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 102.\n\n\"Legislative Environment and the Promotion of the Electricity Produced from Photovoltaic Power Plants in 2009,\" ERO Presentation, 15 October 2009 **(Ex.

In March 2009, the government of the then-incumbent Prime Minister Mr. Mirek Topolanek resigned after a vote of no confidence.76 In May 2009, a temporary government lead by the new Prime Minister Jan Fischer was sworn in.77 This temporary government was in power for more than a year. During that period, it undertook not to \"open any politically contentious, polarising issues during its term in office\" and not to \"submit to the Chamber of Deputies any politically or ideologically polarising legislative proposals\".78 Only in July 2010 was the new government finally formed, following the elections that were scheduled for October 2009, but were postponed by the Czech Constitutional Court until May 2010.79\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 156:19-21.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 156:19-21.\n\nFischer Government Policy Statement (2009) **(Ex.

This is why it [was] trying to agree an amendment to the rules with the government and members of parliament.\"82\n\n\"State wants to stop solar power plants boom\" (e15.cz), 19 June 2009 **(Ex.

A simple cancellation could thus entail a risk of suits filed by investors against the Czech Republic on grounds of lost investment.\"94 Mr. Portu\u017e\u00e1k further stated that the MIT \"is preparing the implementation of the 2009 Directive into the Czech legislation\" meaning that amendments to the existing regulatory regime would \"require longer time\" and would \"exceed the time limit for ERO's obligation to set purchasing prices for RES to be commissioned in 2010\".95\n\nLetter from R.

Mr. To\u0161ovsk\u00fd further explained that draft Act No. 137/2010 would reduce the incentive only from 2011, because some investors had already invested in on-going projects and the change of \"the terms and conditions under which they invested in the course of the development [\u2026] could pose a threat to their investment.\"100\n\nCzech Government's press conference, 16 November 2009 **(Ex.

RES producers that intended to maintain entitlement to the FiT were compelled to enter into new non-negotiable supply contracts with \"Mandatory Purchasers\" chosen by the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade.123 These Mandatory Purchasers were affiliates of the three distribution system operators.124 Second, Act No. 165/2012 introduced an obligation to pay the \"negative electricity hourly price\", which was designed to be paid to the Mandatory Purchasers by RES operators entitled to the FiT or to be deducted from the payable FiT by the Mandatory Purchasers, if the price of electricity on the daily market had a negative value, *i.e.*, when the grid was experiencing a surplus, causing the market price to turn negative.125 Third, Act No. 165/2012 introduced certain recycling fees for the disposal of photovoltaic panels.126 At the same time, the New Act on Promotion did not affect the tariffs guaranteed to the existing installations under the Act on Promotion.127\n\nAct No. 165/2012 Coll. **(Ex.

This Act extended the Solar Levy's application after 31 December 2013 and reduced the Solar Levy to 10% for payments received under the FiT system and to 11% for payments received under the Green Bonuses system.128\n\nArticle 1(9), Act No. 310/2013 Coll. **(Ex. C-113)**.\n\n180.\n\nOn 5 November 2013, the Czech Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade, Mr. Pavel \u0160olc, announced that the Czech Republic planned to amend Act No. 165/2012 Coll., stating that there would be introduced:\n\n[\u2026] a new testing mechanism. For bigger power plants, where the volume of the promotion exceeds the amount of EUR 200,000 in 3 years, after a certain time period we will examine whether the beneficiaries of the promotion make unreasonable profit or not, which would have an adverse effect on the market.129\n\nMemorial, para. 165 *referring to* announcement of 5 November 2013 by the then Czech Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Mr. Pavel \u0160olc **(Ex.

REVIEW OF THE RESPONDENT'S AMENDMENTS TO THE RES REGIME BY THE CZECH COURTS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Solar Levy and the abolition of the Income Tax Provisions, a group of Czech senators (\"**Petitioners**\") brought a challenge to the Czech Constitutional Court, seeking the annulment of these measures.135\n\nCzech Constitutional Court, Case No. Pl. \u00daS 17/11, 15 May 2012, paras. 88-89 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110) (\"May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment\")**.\n\n185.\n\nThe Petitioners asserted that these measures violated a number of Czech and international legal norms, including the right to property, the right to engage in an enterprise and conduct a business, the principle of the rule of law, and the principle of equality before the law.136 With respect to the Solar Levy, the Petitioners argued that solar investors:\n\nreceived very significant assurances from state authorities that they could expect [\u2026] revenues from the production of energy under the framework of the regime stipulated by such Act, and such Act did not stipulate that certain of such producers would face a levy obligation [\u2026] Such expectations constituted legitimate expectations.137\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 2 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 6 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\n186.\n\nAccording to the Petitioners, the withdrawal of the Income Tax Provisions, constituted:\n\na case of arbitrariness on the part of lawmakers, since they could have opted for a *vacatio legis* period long enough to give the relevant taxpayer that began their entrepreneurial activities at any time during the period when the previously existing legal regulation was in effect the ability to use the tax exemption on an equal footing and for the same period of time.138\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 8 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\n187.\n\nIn response to the Petitioners' complaint, and upon invitation by the Czech Constitutional Court, the Czech Government, including the ERO, and both houses of the Czech Parliament, made submissions opposing the complaint.139\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, paras. 14-22 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\n188.\n\nOn 15 May 2012, the Czech Constitutional Court upheld the measures, finding that neither the introduction of the Solar Levy nor the withdrawal of the Income Tax Provisions violated the Czech Constitution as long as Czech law provided for mechanisms to mitigate any \"strangling\" or \"suffocating\" effects.140\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, paras. 88-89 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\n189.\n\nHaving recapitulated the arguments put to it, the Czech Constitutional Court stated, *inter alia*, that:\n\nThe Constitutional Court has not ignored the fact that it had been the state that guaranteed, by means of a law, a fifteen-year payback period on investment and a certain amount of revenues per unit of electricity produced from renewable sources, thereby motivating the affected entities to undertake entrepreneurial activities in the area of energy production from renewable sources.141\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 86 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\n190.\n\nThe Czech Constitutional Court concluded, *inter alia*, that:\n\nThe principle of legal certainty cannot be viewed as being identical to a requirement of absolute unchangeability of legal regulation, since legal regulation is subject to, among other things, social and economic changes and the requirement of ensuring that the state budget remains stable.142\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 85 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\n191.\n\nFollowing the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, individual photovoltaic investors brought proceedings against their tax administrations, alleging that, in their particular case, the Solar Levy had a \"strangling effect\" on them.143 By late 2013, several cases reached the Czech Supreme Administrative Court as the highest Czech Court competent in taxation matters, which denied all claims, noting, *inter alia*, that \"[t]he Constitutional Court's instruction to take liquidating effects of the solar power levy into account in individual cases can only be carried out under current legislation using the institute of tax remission pursuant\" to the Tax Procedure Code.144\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 228.\n\nGrand Chamber of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, Case No. 1 Afs 76/2013-57, 17 December 2013, para. 59 (**Annex 13 to Fr\u00fdzek Report**).\n\n192.\n\nOn 10 July 2014, the Czech Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the Solar Levy was \"in nature a decrease in governmental subsidy and not a tax\" and therefore it did not cause double taxation on the income of solar electricity producers.145\n\nDecision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, 10 July 2014, paras. 17, 20 **(Ex. CLA-2)**.\n\n193.\n\nOn 18 September 2014, in response to the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, the Czech Financial Administration stated as follows:\n\nProducers potentially affected by the individual effect of the solar levy found by the Constitutional Court to be \"strangling\" have been and are able to at least mitigate, if not fully eliminate, its impact using standard tools [*e.g.* tax deferral or payment in instalments] under the Tax Administration Law.146\n\n\"Solution to Potential Individual Liquidating Effects of Levy on Electricity Generated from Solar Radiation,\" Financial Administration Press Release (financnisprava.cz), 18 September 2014 **(Ex.

THE EC'S DECISIONS ON COMPATIBILITY OF THE RES REGIME WITH EU STATE AID LAW**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nOn 8 January 2013, the Czech Republic notified the EC that it had passed the New Act on Promotion (\"**First Notification**\").147\n\nReply, para. 392.\n\n195.\n\nOn 12 June 2014, the EC issued its decision that the financial support foreseen by the New Act on Promotion was granted directly from the State budget and, therefore, involved State aid, but that, by virtue of an exemption, the incentives were still compatible with the internal market.148\n\nEC's Communication on EU State Aid Modernisation, 8 May 2012 **(Ex. R-83)**.\n\n196.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, the Czech Republic filed with the EC a second notification of the RES support mechanisms in respect of RES plants commissioned before 1 January 2013 (\"**Second Notification**\").149 Upon this notification, the EC opened another preliminary examination into the compatibility of the Incentive Regime with EU State aid law as it was applied between 2006 and 2012.150\n\nReply, para. 397.\n\nMemorial, para. 52.\n\n197.\n\nOn 28 November 2016, in response to the Second Notification, the EC decided as follows:\n\nThe Commission regrets that the Czech Republic put the aid measure in question into effect in breach of Article 108(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\nHowever, it has decided, on the basis of the foregoing assessment, not to raise objections to the aid on the grounds that it is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.151\n\nEC Decision on State Aid, 28 November 2016 **(Ex. R-411)**.\n\n**V. THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all claims brought by the Claimant.152\n\nRejoinder, paras. 335, 336.\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims it has brought.153\n\nReply, paras. 490-492, *noting* that the Respondent abandoned its initial objection based on an alleged lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\n\n200.\n\nThe Parties' respective arguments are set out in detail in the sections which follow.\n\n**A. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT IS AN \"INVESTOR\" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is confined to disputes involving an investor of the other Contracting Party. Under the definition of investor set out in Article 1(2), an investor may be a legal person of a Contracting Party,154 which, according to Article 1(2)(b), is an entity \"incorporated or constituted in accordance with, and recognized as a legal person by its laws, having the permanent seat in the territory of that Contracting Party\".155 According to the Respondent, the Claimant does not meet the required condition of having a permanent seat in Cyprus.156 It follows, so says the Respondent, that the Claimant is not an investor within the meaning of the BIT.157\n\nRejoinder, para. 436.\n\nRejoinder, para. 437; Hearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 142:17-143:1.\n\nRejoinder, para. 437.\n\nRejoinder, para. 464; Hearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 142:10-12.\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's explanation as to why it is seated in Cyprus ignores the \"*effet utile*\" of the jurisdictional requirement by conflating the concepts of permanent seat and registered offices.158 In particular, the Respondent submits that the Greek-language version of the BIT, in which \"permanent seat\" is preceded by \"and\", lends further support to its interpretation.159\n\nRejoinder, para. 440.\n\nHearing Transcript (3rd March 2017), 143:5-15.\n\n203.\n\nIn order to determine whether an investor has a permanent seat in a host country, the Respondent argues in favour of a test which, as held in *Tenaris S.A. and Talta-Trading E Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v. Venezuela*, takes into account the ordinary meaning of the term as the place of actual or effective management and not merely that of registration.160 The Respondent submits that this test is applicable to the present circumstances because the Claimant's incorporation under Cypriot law requires a registered office161 and the BIT's requirements in respect of both incorporation and seat in the definition of investor must be satisfied.162 In addition, this test is consistent with the purpose of BITs in general, as exemplified by the decision in *Alps Finance and Trade AG v. Slovakia* and the object and purpose of the BIT.163\n\nRejoinder, paras. 441, 444, *referring to* *Tenaris S.A. and Talta-Trading E Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v.

CLA-161**).\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant does not appear to have its own offices in Cyprus and does not pay (and has not paid) rent for any premises in Cyprus.167 To the extent that the Claimant asserts that it uses the offices of Worthald Partners, the Respondent notes that this is an advisory firm involved in the Claimant's investment decisions and which is managed by Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd.168 Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd is a Czech national and resident, and a shareholder in, and member of the Investment Committee of, the Claimant.169 Further, Worthald's address in Cyprus is also the registered address of numerous other companies, two of which serve as the Claimant's sole director and corporate secretary, respectively.170\n\nRejoinder, para. 452.\n\nRejoinder, para. 450, *referring to* First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, paras. 5, 24.\n\nRejoinder, para. 450, *referring to* First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, paras. 1, 24.\n\nRejoinder, para. 452.\n\n207.\n\nAs for meetings of the board of directors, the Claimant refers to a plurality of Cypriot directors, but the only entity that features as being represented in the minutes is CCY Management, which is part of the Citco Group of Companies. CCY Management offers an array of services, including corporate secretarial services such as attending meetings. The Respondent considers it likely that CCY Management, as the Claimant's sole Cypriot director, is a nominee director affiliated with Citco, and that the alleged regular meetings of the Claimant's director at the registered office were routinely held meetings constitutive of services provided by Citco.171 As for meetings of the shareholders allegedly held at the Claimant's seat, Mr. Milorad Vujnovic, a director for CCY Management, signed by proxy on behalf of the Claimant's three Czech shareholders.172\n\nRejoinder, paras. 453-454.\n\nRejoinder, para. 455, *referring to* Minutes of the meetings of the Claimant's shareholders, 26 May 2011 and 12 March 2012 (**Ex.

S\u00fdkora and Mr. Jan \u010cern\u00fd, all Czech nationals and residents, are located in Cyprus.173 Similarly, the Claimant provided no evidence that it has any employees in Cyprus. Indeed, if there were any, it appears that they were in the Czech Republic.174\n\nRejoinder, para. 456.\n\nRejoinder, para. 457.\n\n209.\n\nIn the context of the Claimant's sale of its interest in SolarOne in 2010, the Respondent also notes that the Claimant provided as contact details in a sale flyer, among others, Worthald Partners' Prague address, to which reference has also been made in the prospective buyers' correspondence.175 No evidence has been provided at all by the Claimant as to the whereabouts of its management records.176 Moreover, the Claimant's tax returns show that it neither owns nor rents property in Cyprus.177 Contrary to its assertion, the Claimant has also not submitted any evidence, except for an audit by a third-party Cypriot firm, to prove that its seat is in Cyprus.178 While it apparently filed tax returns in Cyprus in 2009 and 2010, there is no record that the Claimant made any payment of taxes in Cyprus in those years.179\n\nRejoinder, para. 458, *referring to* \"Sale flyer\" prepared by Worthald Partners in October 2010 (**Annex XIV to First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**); E-mail correspondence between Mr. Ji\u0159\u00ed Chroustovsk\u00fd and Mr. Martin Masat (KPMG Ceska republika, s.r.o.), p. 2 (**Annex XVI to First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**); Purchase offer presented by REN Power CZ, a.s., 16 June 2011, p. 1 (**Annex XVII to First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**).\n\nRejoinder, para. 459.\n\nRejoinder, para. 460, *referring to* WAIEN Income Tax Return for 2009 (**Ex.

It points to certain transactions involving millions of Euros, the source of which is redacted, and which appear to correspond to sums accruing to the Claimant's directors and shareholders, deposited in September 2009 in the Cypriot bank account and promptly transferred back to SolarOne.180\n\nRejoinder, para. 463, *referring to* Bank account statement issued on 29 January 2009 (**Annex XXVIII to Second Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**); Bank account statement issued on 29 September 2009 (**Annex XXIX to Second Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**); WAIEN Income Tax Return for 2009, item 2.3.7 (**Ex.

The Respondent argues that a certificate of incorporation furnishes no conclusive evidence as to the existence of a registered office.181\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 145:9-25.\n\n**2. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it has a \"permanent seat\" in Cyprus and is consequently a \"foreign investor\" under the BIT.182\n\nReply, paras. 485-486.\n\n213.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in order to qualify as a Cypriot investor, it is sufficient to maintain a registered office in Cyprus. Under Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, a \"registered office\" is the same as a \"seat\", as held in *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine* and *Total v. Argentina* in relation to similar provisions.183 The Claimant argues that the fulfilment of this requirement is evidenced by the certificate issued by the Registrar of Companies of Nicosia on 29 September 2010.184\n\nReply, paras. 487-490, *referring to* *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, para. 43 (**Ex. CLA-159**) (\"***Tokios Tokel\u00e8s***\"); *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 August 2006, para. 57 (**Ex. CLA-160**) (\"***Total*** **Decision on Jurisdiction**\").\n\nReply, para. 491, *referring to* WAIEN's commercial register (**Ex. C-16**).\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that, even if it were considered a \"shell company\", it would remain entitled to the protection afforded by the BIT, since the requirement of a seat is merely formal and a stringent economic nexus to Cyprus need not be established.185 It says this contention finds support in Article 63(2) of EU Regulation 1215/2012, whereby \"statutory seat\", as applied to Cyprus, Ireland and the United Kingdom, is regarded as equivalent to \"registered office\".186\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 168-172.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 153-162, *referring to* Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, 12 December 2012, Articles 24, 63(2) (**Ex. C-280**).\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimant also relies upon the absence in the BIT of any express exclusion from investment treaty protection in the case of entities lacking substantive connection to their place of incorporation, as observed in Cypriot and Czech investment treaty practice. The Claimant adds that Cypriot law, which is relevant to determine the ordinary meaning of \"seat\", does not recognize the concept of \"real seat\" (*siege r\u00e9el*).187\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 145-152.\n\n216.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant contends that it is a Cypriot investor, even if it were accepted that for it to have a seat in Cyprus it must have its central management or administration there. The Claimant submits that it operates in Cyprus, as evidenced by the facts that (1) it holds a bank account with a Cypriot bank, used to transfer funds to SolarOne; (2) its financial statements are audited by Cypriot accountants; (3) it pays taxes in Cyprus; (4) it has Cypriot directors regularly meeting at its registered office; and (5) its shareholders also regularly hold meetings at the seat.188\n\nReply, para. 492.\n\n217.\n\nIn this connection, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's reliance on *Alps Finance and Trade v. Slovak Republic* is inapposite, since the BIT does not contain, unlike the Swiss-Slovak Republic BIT, any provision requiring that \"real economic activities\" be carried out by an investor in order to establish that it has a seat in the asserted jurisdiction.189 By reference to the position of the tribunal in *Tenaris* with respect to holding companies, the Claimant submits that protection under the BIT is not conditional on evidence of extensive management responsibilities. On the contrary, given that Cypriot legislation favours the establishment of holding companies in its territory and that such companies were not excluded from protection under the BIT, evidence that the Claimant's shareholders' and board of directors' meetings were held in Cyprus is sufficient to prove that the Claimant had its seat in Cyprus.190\n\nReply, para. 493.\n\nReply, paras. 494-499.\n\n218.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant contests the Respondent's objections that the Claimant was not a foreign investor and that, by commencing the present proceedings, it abused international investment protection.191 According to the Claimant, the nationality of the shareholders is irrelevant and an entity controlled by nationals of the host state may qualify as investor.192 In this vein, the Claimant argues that nationality planning is permitted under international law, insofar as it occurred before a dispute was remotely foreseeable. It does not constitute abusive \"forum shopping\".193 Thus, the Claimant fulfils the requirements to qualify as a protected investor under the BIT as well as under the ECT.194\n\nReply, paras. 500-501.\n\nReply, paras. 502-508, *referring inter alia to Tokios Tokel\u00e8s*, para. 36 (**Ex.

The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that considerable disagreement exists between the Parties as to whether the Claimant qualifies as an \"investor\" under the BIT.195 In this regard, the main question which divides the Parties appears to be whether having a \"registered office\" is sufficient for a legal entity incorporated under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties to the BIT to fulfil the requirement of \"having the permanent seat in the territory of that Contracting Party\" pursuant to Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.196 Despite the fact that the Tribunal finds jurisdiction under the ECT, which does not contain the requirement of a permanent seat, it must decide this question as it relates to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, *rationae personae*, under the BIT.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 437, 464; Hearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 142:10-12; Reply, paras. 485-486.\n\nRejoinder, para. 437; Reply, paras. 487-490. The Parties also disagree as to whether a certificate of incorporation is sufficient to establish the existence of a registered office. *See* Hearing Transcript (3rd March 2017), 145:9-25; Reply, para. 491.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimant qualifies as an \"investor\" under the BIT. In particular, for the reasons more fully explored below, the Tribunal finds itself in agreement with the Respondent to the extent that the latter argues that a registered office is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of \"having the permanent seat\" set out in Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the interpretation of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT is governed by the customary international law rules of treaty interpretation as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This is not disputed by the Parties. A series of key propositions flow from these VCLT provisions.\n\n222.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers that the interpretation of the BIT, including Article 1(2)(b) thereof, is governed exclusively by international law. Reference to domestic law, including the internal laws of the Contracting Parties to the BIT, is to be made only if, and to the extent, permitted by international law (as would be the case, for example, if the BIT contained an express *renvoi*).\n\n223.\n\nAs Article 31 of the VCLT provides, the first step of the interpretative exercise entails consideration of the ordinary meaning of the terms of the BIT provision, considered in their context and in the light of the treaty's object and purpose. The treaty practice of the Parties to the BIT and other acts which are a source of obligations for the Parties to the BIT, such as EU regulations, may be taken into account \"together with the context\" of the BIT, to the extent that they set out, or are grounded upon, \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.\n\n224.\n\nIf the text of a provision of the BIT comprises some elements which justify a *renvoi* to domestic law, and some which do not, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to refer to domestic law for all purposes of its interpretation. In particular, where a provision of the BIT has a separable grammatical structure, those elementsthat do not require a *renvoi* to domestic law must retain their autonomous meaning under international law, whereas those (separable) elements that envisage a *renvoi* must be approached differently.197\n\n*Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. Claimant v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, para. 278, *referring to* \"[t]he grammatical and syntactic structure of the provision and the context in which the term *si\u00e8ge social* is employed\".\n\n225.\n\nOn the basis of the above preliminary considerations, the Tribunal now turns to the interpretation of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT and the Parties' arguments in support of their respective positions.\n\n226.\n\nArticle 1(2)(b) of the BIT, it will be recalled, provides as follows:\n\nThe term \"legal person\" shall mean, with respect to either Contracting Party, any entity incorporated or constituted in accordance with, and recognized as legal person by its laws, having the permanent seat in the territory of the Contracting Party.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it useful to analyse the text of the provision in terms of its grammatical structure and syntactical features, before proceeding to establish the content of the elements of the definition it sets out.\n\n228.\n\nThe opening part of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT contains the *definiendum*, or object, namely the term \"legal person\".198 The remainder of the sentence concerns the *definiens* and is composed of three elements, as follows: (1) \"any entity incorporated or constituted in accordance with,\" (2) \"and recognized as legal person by its laws,\" (3) \"having the permanent seat in the territory of the Contracting Party.\" The first two phrases are of an equal nature, which follows from the use of the conjunction \"and\", and both are jointly qualified by the third phrase.\n\nThe full opening phrase of the sentence's main, and only, clause is as follows: \"[t]he term \"legal person\" shall mean, with respect to either Contracting Party, [\u2026]\".\n\n229.\n\nGiven this structure, the Tribunal finds that there are three cumulative conditions which must be satisfied by \"any entity\" in order to qualify as an \"investor\" under the BIT.199 The Tribunal also notes that the fact that the three elements are cumulative is not contested by the Parties.\n\nRejoinder, para. 437; Hearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 142:17 to 143:1.\n\n230.\n\nAs for the first two elements, the Tribunal notes that Article 1(2)(b) subjects both the incorporation or constitution of a legal entity and the recognition of the legal entity to the internal law of the respective Contracting Party.\n\n231.\n\nAs for the third element, namely \"having the permanent seat\", the Tribunal observes that the term \"seat\" is employed in a qualified manner, as part of the phrase \"having the permanent seat in the territory of that Contracting Party.\" While a *renvoi* to domestic law governing the incorporation or constitution of a legal entity and its recognition as a legal person is required, the interpretation and application of the third element does not require such a *renvoi*. Notably, this approach is consistent with that taken by the tribunal in *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l Algeria*.200\n\n*Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, para. 278.\n\n232.\n\nIn connection with the third element, the Parties disagree as to (1) whether an effective interpretation of the BIT must lead to the conclusion that the third element differs from, and adds to, the requirements set out in the two first elements; and \u2013 if so \u2013 (2) the content of the third element.\n\n233.\n\nThe Parties have invoked a number of decisions in support of their respective positions on these issues. Whereas the Respondent has relied extensively on the decision in *Tenaris*,201 the Claimant has based its reasoning upon the decisions in *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s* and *Total*.202 More particularly, the Respondent has advanced what it considers to be the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"permanent seat\", as construed in light of the object and purpose of the BIT, of its *effet utile* and of investment treaties in general.203 In contrast, to substantiate its position that a registered office is sufficient, the Claimant relies on the ordinary meaning of \"seat\", the investment treaty practice of the Parties to the BIT, the use in relation to Cyprus of \"statutory seat\" as equivalent to \"registered office\" in Article 63(2) of EU Regulation 1215/2012, and Cypriot domestic law.204\n\nRejoinder, para. 448(a)-(i) *referring to Tenaris*, para. 224(a)-(j) (**Ex.

CLA-16**).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 145-162.\n\n234.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, on a proper analysis, the element of Article 1(2)(b) that requires an autonomous interpretation, without recourse to domestic law, has not been satisfied in this case.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal first observes that, contrary to the Claimant's submission, the enquiry mandated by the BIT on this issue does not involve Cypriot law. As noted above, while a *renvoi* is expressly made in connection with the incorporation or constitution and recognition elements set out in Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, this *renvoi* does not extend to the third element in issue here. Hence, the alleged non-recognition of the concept of \"real seat\" in Cypriot law has no bearing on the Tribunal's determination of the content of the requirement of \"having the permanent seat\" in Cyprus. This is a requirement autonomous and independent from Cypriot law.\n\n236.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant's contention that the requirement of \"having the permanent seat\" in Cyprus is to be interpreted as co-extensive with the concept of a \"statutory seat\" and, in particular, with the place of office registration as provided for in Article 63(2) of EU Regulation 1215/2012. The definition of \"legal person\" under the BIT is a matter of international law. While an EU regulation may be taken into account, together with the context of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, in the present case, given the specific features of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, the Tribunal does not consider the definition in Article 63(2) of EU Regulation 1215/2012 relevant to its enquiry.\n\n237.\n\nAs to the precise meaning of the requirement of \"having the permanent seat\", under Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, the Tribunal agrees with the *Tenaris* tribunal's approach, albeit rendered in different circumstances.\n\n238.\n\nIn *Tenaris*, the tribunal interpreted and applied two provisions. First, Article 1(1)(b) of the Portugal-Venezuela BIT, which employs the term \"seat\" (\"*sede*\") without any qualification.205 Second, Article 1(B) of the Belgium/Luxembourg-Venezuela BIT, which uses \"seat\" in a qualified manner, as part of the phrase \"corporate seat\" (\"*si\u00e8ge social*\").206 The *Tenaris* tribunal held that both the text of the provisions and the principle of effectiveness required that the \"seat\" requirement, whether qualified or not, be given effect, so that it would necessarily mean something different from, and additional to, incorporation, and thus more than registration, which is merely a formal aspect of incorporation. It reasoned further that this additional meaning would be coextensive with the requirement that \"seat\" be where \"actual or genuine corporate activity\" takes place, which amounts to the place of \"actual or effective management\" of the legal entity.207\n\nArticle 1(1)(b) of the Portugal-Venezuela BIT (in Portuguese), reads, in its relevant parts, as follows: \"[\u2026]. *As pessoas colectivas [\u2026] que tenham sede numa das Partes Contratantes e estejam constituidas e funcionem de acordo com a lei dessa Parte Contratante [\u2026]*\".\n\nArticle 1(B) of the Portugal-Venezuela BIT (in Portuguese), reads, in its relevant parts, as follows: \"*les \u00absocietes, c'est-\u00e0-dire toute personne morale constitu\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation du Royaume de Belgique, du grand-duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg ou de la R\u00e9publique du Venezuela et ayant son si\u00e8ge social sur le territoire du Royaume de Belgique; du grand-duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg ou de la R\u00e9publique du Venezuela respectivement [\u2026]*\".\n\n*Tenaris*, paras. 150, 151, 154 (**Ex. CLA-161**).\n\n239.\n\nIn line with this analysis, the Tribunal also concludes that \"seat\" must mean more than mere registration or incorporation. This all the more so in the present BIT, given that the text of Article 1(2)(b) further qualifies the use of \"seat\" by adding an additional requirement of permanency. The text of the provision therefore strongly indicates that the requirement of \"having the permanent seat\" must have a meaning separate from the requirements of incorporation or constitution of a legal entity and recognition of the legal entity as a legal person*.*\n\n240.\n\nThis finding is consistent with the object and purpose of the BIT as stipulated in its preamble. In particular, the Tribunal's reading of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT is consistent with the intention of the Contracting Parties \"to maintain conditions favourable to investments of investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\".208 It thus ensures that investment protection is reciprocal, by requiring that a legal entity of one Contracting Party is accorded treaty protection only if, among other criteria, it is more than merely incorporated or registered in the territory of the other Contracting Party.209\n\nBIT, Preamble, para. 3 (**Ex. C-2)**.\n\nBIT, Preamble, para. 4 (**Ex. C-2)**.\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted, in the alternative to its main argument, that, even if it were considered a \"shell company\", it would remain entitled to treaty protection as an \"investor\" given the absence of a \"denial of benefits\" provision excluding entities lacking a substantive connection from treaty protection. Further, and in any case, the Claimant argues that it does have a seat in Cyprus. The Tribunal is unpersuaded on both counts.\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimant's first submission relies on a reading whereby the context of the provision, *i.e.*, the absence of a specific kind of clause in the remainder of the treaty, would trump the express text of the BIT. This is an impermissible approach to treaty interpretation. But in any event, such a reading would take no account of the fact that \"denial of benefits\" provisions tend only to apply to a legal entity that qualifies as an \"investor\" under the treaty in the first place, albeit one controlled by \"third-country nationals\".210 Hence, to the extent that a company without substantive connection to Cyprus is not an \"investor\" under the BIT, reasoning based on the absence of a \"denial of benefits\" provision in the BIT is of no assistance.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e8s*, paras. 35-36 (**Ex. CLA-159**).\n\n243.\n\nAs to the Claimant's second submission, in the Tribunal's view the Claimant has not demonstrated that it has its \"permanent seat\" in Cyprus. According to the *Oxford Dictionary*, as also from obvious standard usage, the adjective \"permanent\" applies to a state of affairs \"[l]asting or intended to last or remain unchanged indefinitely\", and, in particular, one which is \"[l]asting or continuing without interruption.\"211\n\nAvailable at https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/permanent.\n\n244.\n\nOn the basis of the totality of evidence and submissions before it, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant's assertion that it has established its permanent seat in Cyprus. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant does not operate on a permanent basis in Cyprus, and nor is there any basis to conclude that it has \"the permanent seat\" there.\n\n245.\n\nIn particular, the aspects set out below demonstrate otherwise.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant's managers, namely Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd, Mr. Petr. S\u00fdkora and Mr. Jan \u010cern\u00fd, all of whom are Czech nationals and residents, were not based in Cyprus.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimant's employees, if any,212 were likewise mainly based in the Czech Republic, and had a limited and temporary involvement in its Cypriot operations, as illustrated by Mr. S\u00fdkora's participation in SolarOne's shareholders' meetings.\n\nHearing Transcript (28 February 2017), 73:3-5: \"Q. Do you have any employees there? A. I believe there was a director, but he is not an employee.\"\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant's tax returns indicate that it owns or rents no property in Cyprus, nor was any payment of taxes made in Cyprus for the years of 2009 and 2010, in relation to which the Claimant had filed tax returns.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimant's bank account with a Cypriot bank was used temporarily only, to transfer funds in September 2009, which were promptly transferred back to SolarOne.\n\n250.\n\nLastly, during his testimony, Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd stated that: (1) he permanently resides in the Czech Republic;213 (2) he had \"never visited\" and had \"never even been\" to the Claimant's office in Cyprus;214 and that (3) he had \"never attended in person\" any of the Claimant's shareholders' meetings and had \"never [been] physically there\".215\n\nHearing Transcript (28 February 2017), 66:13-14.\n\nHearing Transcript (28 February 2017), 72:15-19: \"Q. When was the last time that you visited WAIEN's office in Cyprus? A. Because as partners we did not need to be present there in person, I have never visited this office, I've never been there.\"\n\nHearing Transcript (28 February 2017), 73:6-16: \"Q. [\u2026]. Have you ever had a shareholders' meeting of WAIEN in Cyprus? [\u2026]. A. All shareholders' meetings take place every year, because the auditor's report as well as the financial statements have to be approved. Yes, there were shareholders' meetings of WAIEN in Cyprus. Q. Did you ever attend those meetings yourself? A. My participation was done through proxy, on the basis of a power of attorney. So I have never attended in person, I was never physically there.\"\n\n251.\n\nIn light of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to embark upon an analysis as to whether the Claimant has abused investment treaty protection by commencing the present proceedings.\n\n252.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that the Claimant is not an \"investor\" under the BIT, as it does not have \"the permanent seat\" in Cyprus, pursuant to Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT. It follows that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *rationae personae*.\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimant has initiated claims under BIT Article 2(2) (\"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and secrutiy\") as well as a claim for \"non-impairment\" pursuant to the BIT's Most Favored Nation Treatment provision on the basis of BIT Article 3(1), 3(2) and 3(4) and on the German and Netherlands investment treaties concluded with the Czech Republic. However, as the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction under the BIT, these claim are not admitted.\n\n**B. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT MADE A \"FOREIGN\" INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ECT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the ECT over investment owned by domestic investors through a foreign shell company.216\n\nRejoinder, para. 337.\n\n255.\n\nPursuant to the text of Article 1(6) of the ECT, which defines the term \"investment\", the alleged investment of the Claimant does not qualify for the purposes of the Article, because it does not exhibit the economic characteristics of an investment, including most notably a contribution made from outside the host state, as opposed to one which is merely held by the putative investor.217 The Respondent contends that the ECT is to be interpreted as requiring that the investment be of foreign origin, as an economic characteristic.218\n\nRejoinder, paras. 470-474, *referring to* *Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (Canada) v.

The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal is not called upon to determine whether the funds it used originated from outside the Czech Republic, since a requirement concerning the origin of capital lacks a basis in the text of the ECT and, generally, is not well established as a matter of international investment law and arbitral jurisprudence.223\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 173, 184.\n\n259.\n\nTo this end, the Claimant contests the soundness and relevance of an inherent meaning test in determining the existence of an investment.224 Such a test remains controversial. It has been associated primarily with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention which, unlike the ECT, contains no definition of investment.225 Also, the applicable criteria according to this test are not necessarily applicable by analogy to the ECT, in which a different concept of investment obtains. In the rare instances where this test has been applied, tribunals have relied upon it to decline jurisdiction over straightforward commercial transactions.226 The Claimant adds that ECT tribunals have refrained from basing their determination as to whether a claimant possesses an investment within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT on an alleged objective meaning of the term investment.227 Furthermore, arbitral tribunals have refused to incorporate additional requirements into the definition of investment under the applicable treaty on grounds of an allegedly objective meaning of investment.228\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 174, 181-183.

The Claimant emphasises that the Respondent has failed to address the only aspect of potential relevance to a determination of the existence of an alleged \"abuse of process\" in this instance, namely the timing of the Claimant's investment.231 The Claimant submits that no question of \"manufacturing\" jurisdiction arose, because its investments were in place before any dispute. The Claimant was incorporated four years in advance of the challenged measures and made its investments without any hint as to a dispute with the Respondent.232\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 196-197.

The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Parties' disagreement as to whether the Claimant has made an investment within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT. In particular, the Parties disagree as to whether an investment requires the contribution of funds which originate from outside the host state.\n\n263.\n\nIt is recalled that the Respondent relies primarily upon the decisions in *Nova Scotia*233 and *Standard Chartered*,234 to argue that a contribution of foreign origin is required by the inherent meaning of the term \"investment\". The Claimant contests the existence and, if any, the relevance of an inherent meaning of investment. In the alternative, it submits that it made an investment which satisfies such an inherent conception by making an appropriate financial contribution.\n\n*Nova Scotia*, para. 82 (**Ex. RLA-304**).\n\n*Standard Charted Bank*, para. 232 (**Ex. RLA-308**).\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that funds must originate from outside the host state for a contribution so funded to qualify as an investment under the ECT. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the primary basis for the Tribunal's decision is the text of the ECT. It reaches its conclusion on this basis and does not deem it necessary to address the Parties' submissions in the alternative, or those regarding the existence of an inherent meaning of investment.\n\n265.\n\nAs previously noted, the interpretation of a treaty provision is governed by the customary international law rules codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. That is not disputed by the Parties. Further, and again as noted previously in this Award, consistent with Article 31 of the VCLT, the ordinary meaning of the terms of a treaty provision, considered in their context and in the light of its object and purpose, forms the first step of any interpretive exercise.\n\n266.\n\nArticle 1(6) of the ECT reads as follows:\n\nAs used in this Treaty:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(6) \"Investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:\n\n(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;\n\n(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;\n\n(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value and associated with an Investment;\n\n(d) Intellectual Property;\n\n(e) Returns;\n\n(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector. A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments and the term \"Investment\" includes all investments, whether existing at or made after the later of the date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of the Investor making the investment and that for the Contracting Party in the Area of which the investment is made (hereinafter referred to as the \"Effective Date\") provided that the Treaty shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective Date.\n\n\"Investment\" refers to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a Contracting Party in its Area as \"Charter efficiency projects\" and so notified to the Secretariat.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that Article 1(6) of the ECT establishes a requirement as to the foreign origin of the funds of an investment. In particular, the Tribunal notes that Article 1(6) refers to \"every kind of asset\", regardless of the origin of the funds for its acquisition. The only restriction is that the asset in question is \"owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor\". The Tribunal considers that whether an investment is owned by an investor is a question to be determined independent of the question of the origin of the funds employed by an investor to acquire such investment. Furthermore, while the investor needs to be a national of another Contracting Party, the ECT does not require that the funds originate in the other Contracting Party.\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent has relied upon a number of decisions, to the relevance of which the Tribunal now briefly turns. Most prominently amongst these are the decisions in *Nova Scotia* and *Standard Chartered*.\n\n269.\n\nAs the Claimant has correctly observed, in *Nova Scotia* the tribunal held that the dispute concerned a sale of goods, which could not be considered an \"investment\".235 Its reasoning therefore is not applicable to present circumstances. As for *Standard Chartered*, the tribunal in that arbitration found that the use of the verb \"made\" entailed an investor's \"active\" role, \"rather than simple passive ownership.\"236 In this regard, it suffices to note that, unlike Article I(a) of the Tanzania-UK BIT, Article 1(6) of the ECT does not employ the verb \"made\" and expressly provides for indirect control. In any case, if a requirement as to the degree of involvement of the investor in the making of an investment were applicable, such requirement would not have any bearing upon the origin of the funds applied by the investors.\n\n*Nova Scotia*, para. 113 **(Ex. RLA-304**).\n\n*Standard Charted Bank*, para. 232 (**Ex.

In support of its propositions that treaty protection and the Tribunal's jurisdiction are precluded, the Respondent principally relies on the decisions in *Phoenix* and *KT Asia.* The Claimant argues that the Czech nationality of its beneficial owner and the degree of intensity of its economic connection with Cyprus have no bearing upon the existence and scope of treaty protection under the ECT.\n\n271.\n\nThe *Phoenix* tribunal considered the *bona fide* character of the investment to establish whether \"the Claimant engaged in an abusive attempt to get access to ICSID\".237 Notwithstanding this fact, which renders the decision inapposite in principle, the Tribunal notes that the *Phoenix* tribunal considered the timing of the claim and that, as correctly pointed out by the Claimant, in this case the Claimant's incorporation took place before any dispute was foreseeable.238 The situation was therefore different for the claimant in *Phoenix*, which notified the dispute to the respondent before it registered the ownership of the companies at issue in the Czech Republic.239\n\n*Phoenix*, paras. 136 (**Ex. RLA-1**).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 191-202.\n\n*Phoenix*, paras. 138 (**Ex.

In addition, the parties in that matter had not contested that the \"objective definition\" of investment was relevant to both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.240 As such, the decision in *KT Asia* of limited if any assistance for present purposes. But more than this, the Tribunal observes that, according to this decision, a commitment of resources must be made, failing which an \"asset belonging to the claimant\" is not to be deemed a protected investment. The *KT Asia* tribunal, which denied jurisdiction on the sole basis of its finding that no contribution had been made,241 did not interpret the BIT so as to set out a requirement concerning the origin of funds. In this case, the Claimant has argued that it made a financial contribution. The Respondent does not seem to contest this proposition, having confined its position in this respect to arguing that the Claimant's contribution did not originate outside the host state.\n\n*KT Asia*, para. 166 (**Ex. CLA-163**)\n\n*KT Asia*, para. 206 (**Ex. CLA-163**)\n\n273.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal has considered the Parties' submissions regarding the alleged character of the Claimant as a shell company, and whether the holding of such an entity is insufficient to constitute an investment under the BIT.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal's observations regarding the general relevance of the decision in *KT Asia* above hold true in relation to this argument as well. Article 1(6) of the ECT neither requires that an investment belongs to, or be owned by, an entity having a substantial connection with its place of incorporation, nor does it preclude the protection of an investment made by an entity which mainly serves as a holding company. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant's contention that the ECT does not require that a substantial connection be established for a legal entity to be deemed an investor and for its investment to be protected.\n\n275.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimant's investments under the ECT.\n\n**C. WHETHER THE SOLAR LEVY IS A TAX FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ECT TAX CARVE-OUT (ARTICLE 21 ECT)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Solar Levy as this measure is a tax under Czech law for purposes of the ECT's tax exclusion clause set out in Article 21 of the ECT.242 The Respondent observes that the Claimant itself considered the Tax Incentives to be taxation measures243 and contends that the only disagreement with the Claimant pertains to the characterization of the Acts which adopted and extended the Solar Levy as \"Taxation Measures\".244\n\nRejoinder, para. 351.\n\nRejoinder, para. 352.\n\nRejoinder, para. 340; Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 241:11-15.\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Claimant that Article 31 of the VCLT governs the interpretation of Article 21(7) of the ECT. It submits that the Contracting State parties gave the term \"Taxation Measures\" a special meaning, whereby, for the determination of the character of a measure as a \"provision relating to taxes of the domestic law\" within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT, the Tribunal \"must look to the domestic law of the Czech Republic\".245\n\nRejoinder, paras. 341-345; Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 244:4-15.\n\n278.\n\nThe Respondent contests all of the Claimant's arguments which contradict this proposition for the following reasons (broadly summarized): (1) the use of domestic law to determine the characterization of a measure as a tax is justified, given the express *renvoi* to domestic law in Article 21 of the ECT and the importance of a state's taxation power, which is admitted by the Claimant;246 (2) the intention of the ECT's drafters lends support to the need to resort to domestic law, as evidenced by Article 21(5) of the ECT, which calls upon competent domestic tax authorities to state their views as to the limited number of tax-related issues capable of submission to international arbitration;247 (3) the Claimant has not explained why the use of domestic law would undermine the ECT's purpose;248 and (4) it is not contrary to good faith that states have resort to their own domestic law, for, as a matter of fact, states are free to opt out of international obligations. In any event, the Respondent has not sought to act as judge and jury or to escape its international obligations, as it has accepted that the Tribunal will make the ultimate determination as to whether the Solar Levy meets the definition set out in Article 21(7) of the ECT.249\n\nRejoinder, para. 347; Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 245:2-12.\n\nRejoinder, para. 348; Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 246:16-20.\n\nRejoinder, para. 349.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 350-352.\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent, referring to the decision in *Emmis and others v. Hungary*, argues that the character of the Solar Levy must be established with reference to Czech domestic law. Like any tax, the Solar Levy has a rate, a base and a taxpayer, and was treated as a tax by the Czech legislative, executive and judicial organs. This is evidenced, most notably, by its inclusion in the Tax Administration Law (\"**TAL**\") and its characterization by the Czech Constitutional Court as a \"tax or fee\" within the meaning of Article 11(5) of the Czech Republic's Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (\"**Charter**\"), holding that the Solar Levy, like any other taxes, should be \"levied only on the basis of the law.\"250 In this connection, the Respondent notes that Article 11(5) of the Charter and Section 2(3) of the TAL are legislative instruments for the purposes of Article 21(7) of the ECT. In response to the Claimant's argument that Article 11(5) of the Charter is inconclusive so far as the question whether the Solar Levy constitutes a tax is concerned, as it refers to \"taxes and fees\", the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not argue that the Solar Levy is a \"fee\" rather than a \"tax\". In addition, the Solar Levy is classified as a tax by the OECD and EUROSTAT. Moreover, the reason for taxes and fees being treated under the same umbrella in the TAL is that Czech legal and accounting practice does not differentiate between taxes and other public charges.251 Furthermore, the Respondent draws the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the ECT only requires that the Solar Levy be a measure \"relating to taxes of the domestic law\", which is presently the case as it is designated as a tax in the Czech Republic's Tax Code, is collected as such, and is accounted for and reported as a tax.252 Hence, in light of the above, the Solar Levy qualifies as a \"Taxation Measure\" under Article 21(7), and is thus covered by the carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT.253\n\nRejoinder, paras. 353-359, *referring to* *Emmis and others v.

In relation to the place of \"academic theory\", the Respondent submits that the ECT does not call for an academic exercise, since Article 21(7) of the ECT places exclusive reliance upon legislation and the Contracting States' power to decide what is a tax. In any event, academic theory is unhelpful in this case, given the inherent lack of clarity of the term \"taxes\", acknowledged in scholarly writing.254 However, even if the Tribunal were to consider \"academic theory\" relevant, the Respondent submits that the Solar Levy possesses the six features identified and relied upon by the Claimant as the test of a taxation measure.255 In particular, it is uncontested that the Solar Levy is obligatory, non-refundable, introduced by law and intended to serve as income of the state budget for the financing of society-wide needs.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 367-373; First Fr\u00fdzek Report, para. 26; Second Fr\u00fdzek Report, para. 30; First Borkovec Report, paras. 27, 29-32; Kot\u00e1b Report, paras. 41, 47, 96, 100.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 374-375; First Borkovec Report, para. 23. *See also* Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 182:24-25.\n\n281.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Respondent claims that the Solar Levy is also non-equivalent. According to the Respondent, this fact is acknowledged by the Claimant's experts who state that the Solar Levy is \"formally indeed non-equivalent,\" and that \"equivalence\" exists only \"to a certain extent.\"256 The Respondent contends that the right to receive the FiT is independent from the Solar Levy \"due to the absence of an immediate, direct and concrete consideration in return on the part of the public authority\".257 Instead, the right derives from the obligation of compulsory purchasers to purchase RES electricity at a fixed price. Indeed, solar plants installed before the solar boom and producers of non-solar forms of RES electricity are equally entitled to the FiT, but not liable to pay the Solar Levy.258 The relationship between the Solar Levy and the FiT is confined to the fact that both are charged on the same product, namely electricity produced by solar RES, at an amount which corresponds to a fixed proportion of the price received for such electricity. Similar relations are commonly seen in relation to other taxes, such as VAT, which amounts to a percentage of the value of goods and services the consumption of which is taxed.259 In short, payment of the Solar Levy involves no \"*quid pro quo*\" in consideration for receiving the FiT.260\n\nRejoinder, para. 378; First Fr\u00fdzek Report, para. 30; Borkovec Report, para. 36, respectively stating that the Solar Levy is \"formally indeed non-equivalent,\" and that \"equivalence\" exists only \"to a certain extent.\" *See also* Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 182:25 to 183:14.\n\nRejoinder, para. 379, *quoting from* R.

While the Solar Levy was originally expected to offset approximately one third of the budgetary expenditure on RES subsidies, this was merely an estimate and, ultimately, no correlation ever existed in practice.262\n\nRejoinder, para. 381, *referring to* Article 1(8)-(9), 1(12), Act 310/2013 Coll., **(Ex.

In particular, it is not paid on a transactional basis; it is not \"voluntary\"; and it is not \"irregular\".263 In any case, the Claimant's proposition that the Solar Levy is a fee for receiving the FiT is inconsequential, since the distinction between taxes and fees is of very limited significance under contemporary Czech tax law and practice, and given that fees \"relate to\" taxes, within the meaning of Article 21(7) of the ECT, to the extent that a fee administered by the TAL is part of the Czech tax system.264\n\nRejoinder, paras. 382-384.\n\nRejoinder, para. 384.\n\n284.\n\nMoreover, the Solar Levy is not paid for a specific purpose. Leaving aside the irrelevance of legislative reasons for this purpose and the existence of purpose-oriented taxes, as exemplified by road taxes, the absence of a specific purpose is demonstrated by the fact that proceeds of the Solar Levy were deposited into the general treasury account.265 Given its nature as a revenue raising measure, which was meant to reduce excessive profits, the Solar Levy on the contrary was a tax measure perfectly consistent with *bona fide* taxation purposes.266\n\nRejoinder, paras. 385-388, *referring to* Kot\u00e1b Report, paras. 56-60; First Fr\u00fdzek Report, paras. 25, 26(f).\n\nRejoinder, paras. 389-393, *referring to* *Yukos Universal Limited v.

That is a ruling which enjoys greater authority than, and is not affected by, those adopted by individual panels, such as the judgment of 10 July 2014 of the Supreme Administrative Court relied upon by the Claimant. To the extent that the latter decision held that the Solar Levy was not of a tax nature, on grounds of its non-equivalence, this conclusion was set out in a \"single-paragraph *obiter* statement\" which, in the opinion of the Respondent, resulted from the panel's lack of familiarity with the mechanics of RES support.268\n\nRejoinder, paras. 394-396, *referring to* Hal\u00ed\u010dek Report, paras. 47-48; 2 May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, paras. 46, 59, 60, 64 **(Ex.

The Claimant's allegation is based on an unwarranted assumption and disproved most notably by the fact that the *dictum* that the Solar Levy is not a tax was rendered by the Supreme Administrative Court *sua sponte*.269\n\nRejoinder, paras. 408-411.\n\n287.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's remaining indicators of the non-tax nature of the Solar Levy are wrong. As for the submission to Parliament of draft Act 402/2010 by the Ministry of Industry and Trade instead of the Ministry of Finance, the Respondent observes that the Ministry of Finance and the Government as a whole were involved in the process, which led to the adoption of the Solar Levy.270 With regard to the use of the term \"levy\", the Respondent states that the use of the term resulted from the Ministry of Finance's practice of using different terminology for *ad hoc* taxes introduced by general legislation. In any event, there are other levies in Czech legislation, most of which are taxes.271 As for the limited extent of the group of taxpayers, the Respondent observes that there are taxes in the Czech system for the payment of which only several hundred subjects are liable.272 The Respondent alleges that the acknowledgement of the potential expropriatory effects of the Solar Levy by the Constitutional Court relates to the constitutionality of the measure, not its tax nature. In any event, the Constitutional Court did not find the Solar Levy to be a confiscatory tax.273 As for the temporary nature of the Solar Levy, the Respondent argues that temporary taxes have been levied in the Czech Republic in the past and that there is no requirement that a measure be indefinite in order to qualify as a tax.274 From the foregoing, it follows, according to the Respondent, that both the Solar Levy and the Tax Holiday, the character as a tax of which is not in dispute, are taxes.275\n\nRejoinder, paras. 412-413, *referring to* Kot\u00e1b Report, para. 39; First Witness Statement of Ladislav Min\u010di\u010d Statement, dated 19 September 2016 (\"**First Min\u010di\u010d Statement**\"), para. 6.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 414-415, *referring to* Min\u010di\u010d Statement, para. 14.\n\nRejoinder, para. 416, *referring to* Kot\u00e1b Report, paras. 65.\n\nRejoinder, para. 417, *referring to* Kot\u00e1b Report, para. 63.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 418-419, *referring to* Kot\u00e1b Report, para. 68.\n\nRejoinder, para. 420.\n\n288.\n\nFinally, and in response to the allegation that the Solar Levy was enacted in bad faith, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's allegations of impropriety are unfounded; the Solar Levy applied to all solar producers, regardless of whether they were entitled to investment treaty protection.276 Referring to the decision of the tribunal in *Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru*, the Respondent argues that good faith must, in principle, be assumed;277 that, in any case, the Energy Charter Secretariat 2015 publication does not suggest that taxes must be imposed in good faith;278 and that, even if it were accepted that bad faith was involved, such conduct would only be relevant to the merits,279 but it would not affect the character as a tax of the Solar Levy under Czech domestic law. Furthermore, the Respondent submits that no bad faith can be inferred from the use of a mechanism, which the Claimant deems convoluted since, as observed by the tribunal in *Invesmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic*, not having resort to the most obvious solution is not an automatic indication of bad faith.280 To conclude, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal decline jurisdiction in relation to the Claimant's ECT claims.\n\nRejoinder, para. 423, *referring to* Min\u010di\u010d Statement, para. 15.\n\nRejoinder, para. 424, *quoting* *Tza Yap Shum v.

The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimant challenges the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction, and in particular its submission that the Solar Levy is a tax due to its characterization as such under Czech law and that the VCLT plays no role, since the ECT defines \"taxation measure\" by express reference to domestic law.281\n\nReply, paras. 519-523; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 14-15, 20-21, 129-130.\n\n290.\n\nPointing out that what is at issue is the interpretation of a treaty provision, the Claimant argues that the applicable rules of interpretation are contained in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, whereby the definition of \"taxation measure\" set out in Article 21(7) of the ECT must be interpreted in good faith, bearing in mind the context and the object and purpose of the ECT.282\n\nReply, paras. 524-530.\n\n291.\n\nIn this connection, the Claimant argues that, as recognized by the Respondent, the VCLT is applicable to, and plays a central role in, the interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT.283 In particular, the Claimant contends that, since the Respondent has failed to establish that a \"special meaning\" pursuant to Article 31(4) of the VCLT is to be attributed to the term \"taxation measures\" in Article 21(7) of the ECT, only its \"ordinary meaning\" is to be taken into account.284 Furthermore, the Claimant maintains that the *renvoi* to domestic law does not preclude the application of Article 31(1) of the VCLT to the interpretation of Article 21(7) of the ECT, due to the latter's international nature as a treaty provision.285\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 21-22, 27-28.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 24-26.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 27-32.\n\n292.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent's interpretation of Article 21(7) of the ECT, according to which a contracting state's mere characterization of a measure as \"taxation\" would suffice to remove it from the scope of the ECT, is at odds with the ECT's drafters' intention, the good faith standard, and the purpose of the ECT. In particular, relying upon the decisions in *Yukos Universal Limited v. Russia,*286*RoslnvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,287* and *Quasar de Valores v. The Russian Federation*,288 the Claimant argues that a good faith interpretation of the ECT tax carve-out is called for, whereby it is confined to *bona fide* measures. Contracting States are thereby prevented from an otherwise unrestricted freedom to escape their obligations under the ECT.289 In this vein, the Claimant maintains that a determination as to the *bona fide* character of a measure is crucial to establish whether it is a \"taxation measure\" within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and, thus, of relevance not only to the merits of, but also to a tribunal's jurisdiction over, a dispute arising out of such a measure.290\n\n*Yukos* **(Ex.

The Claimant does not accept that an attempt to find a lawful solution to a problem is necessarily an indication of good faith, since compliance with domestic law is not an excuse for breaches of international obligations. Also, the Claimant does not accept that the applicability of the Solar Levy regardless of the nationality of solar energy producers demonstrated that their ability to invoke investment treaty protection had not been considered. In this regard, the Claimant highlights that the Respondent sought legal opinions concerning the risks of investment arbitration as a result of the enactment of the Solar Levy.298\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 60-61, *referring to* Minutes of the third meeting of the Coordination Committee of 15 October 2010, p. 4 **(Ex.

Instead, the Claimant submits that: (1) the question of whether the Solar Levy is a tax was directly addressed by the Supreme Administrative Court and not merely in an *obiter* portion of the decision; (2) the judgment of the Grand Chamber of 17 December 2013, relied upon by the Respondent, only characterized the Solar Levy as a tax, because it is administered according to the TAL; (3) the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 10 July 2014 is not isolated, since several other judgments of Czech courts, including the Constitutional Court and the Second and Fifth Chambers of the Supreme Administrative Court have ruled that the Solar Levy is not a tax, but a *de facto* reduction of the FiT.301\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 109-119, *citing to* Decision of the Grand Chamber of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, Case No. 1 Afs 76/2013-57, 17 December 2013, para. 28 **(Annex 13 to First Fr\u00fdzek Report)**; Decision of the Czech Constitutional Court, Case No. 2216/14, 13 January 2015, para. 5 **(Annex 14 to First Fr\u00fdzek Report)**; 15 May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 45 **(Ex.

In response to the proposition that a direct reduction of the FiT would have needed to be much greater than 26%, the Claimant notes that this is unsupported by the facts. In fact, while during the meeting of the Economic Committee of 2 November 2010 an increase of the Solar Levy rate from 26% to 50% was discussed so as to avoid the imposition of a tax on emission allowances, the question of a direct reduction of the FiT was not in issue.302 Also, the Solar Levy is not necessarily more flexible than a reduction of the FiT, nor temporary, and, in any case, a reduction of the FiT did not have to be permanent.303 In addition, the enactment of a direct reduction of the FiT would not have been more cumbersome than the introduction of the Solar Levy.304\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 56-57, *referring to* Minutes of Session of the Economic Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, 2 November 2010, pp. 3-4, 12 **(Ex.

This is allegedly evidenced by discussions in the Czech Parliament prior to the adoption of Act No. 402/2010, most notably during a meeting of the Emergency Coordination Committee held in October 2010,305 and the Respondent's own allegation that the measure was in fact not a tax, made in connection with a challenge to the Solar Levy before the Czech Supreme Court.306 The Claimant adds that the Respondent, for this reason, is now estopped from arguing that the Solar Levy is a *bona fide* tax under international law.307 For its part, the Claimant also contends that it is not estopped from characterizing the Solar Levy as a non-tax measure, most notably since terms used in the SPV's financial statements are irrelevant for the purposes of determining the nature of the Solar Levy as a tax.308\n\nReply, paras. 544-548, *referring to* Minutes of Session of the Economic Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, 2 November 2010, p. 5 **(Ex.

Therefore, the Solar Levy lacks one typical feature of all taxes, according to academic theory.313\n\nReply, paras. 563-574, *referring to* Minutes of Session of the Economic Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, 2 November 2010, p. 1 (**Ex. C-123)**. *See also* Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 10-11.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 96-100.\n\n303.\n\nIn this vein, the Claimant argues that the legislative reasons for implementing the Solar Levy are \"irrelevant for the purposes of the \u2018specific purpose' inquiry\". Instead, the Tribunal should focus on the \"purpose for which the funds are actually allocated\".314 The Claimant argues further that the existence of a specific purpose is a mandatory feature of taxes; that the Solar Levy is a *de facto* reduction of the FiT and not a revenue-raising measure and therefore does not meet the *bona fide* test as articulated by the *Yukos* tribunal; and that reliance on the fact that the Solar Levy is collected in a separate account, not administered by the same Ministry in charge of budgetary contributions to the FiT, entails a formalistic distinction and is irrelevant since the cash flows of the Solar Levy and the RES support subsidy are connected through the State budget.315\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 93.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 90-95.\n\n304.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that the Solar Levy does not meet the non-equivalence requirement, which is a mandatory requirement of all taxes. This entails that no consideration on the part of the State for the payment of a tax must be involved, as acknowledged by all four party experts.316 According to the Claimant, there was a direct link, or a \"*quid pro quo*\", between the Solar Levy and the payment of FiT and Green Bonuses.317 This conclusion finds support in the decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court of 10 July 2014, which held that the Solar Levy was not a tax, but a *de facto* reduction of the FiT and Green Bonuses.318 The decision, in the Claimant's submission, is thorough and highly authoritative, therefore dealing a fatal blow to the Respondent's argument.319 In particular, the decision lends further support to the fundamental character of non-equivalence as a feature of all taxes, and also confirms that the Solar Levy fails to meet the non-equivalence standard, a conclusion shared by Messrs. Borkovec and Fr\u00fdzek.320\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 101.\n\nReply, paras. 575-577.\n\nReply, paras. 578-582, 614, *referring to* Decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, 10 July 2014, paras. 5, 19-20 **(Ex.

[\u2026] this conclusion was also reached by the Supreme Administrative Court decision of 10 July 2014 (para. 19 and 20), which \u2013 as of today \u2013 remains the sole Czech ruling that thoroughly analyzed the nature of the solar levy\" (emphasis omitted).\n\n305.\n\nWith respect to certain decisions of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court relied upon by the Respondent,321 the Claimant contends that only the decision of 10 July 2014 actually analysed the Solar Levy, and that the references to the Solar Levy as a \"tax\" in the other decisions are either vague or confined to the character as a tax for the purposes of the TAL. In any event, these decisions were without prejudice to the finding of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court which held that, while being a \"tax\" within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the TAL, the Solar Levy resulted in a *de facto* decrease of the level of support to solar energy producers.322\n\nReply, paras. 583-592, *referring to* Decision of the Czech Constitutional Court, Case No. 2216/14, 13 January 2015, paras. 25, 33 (**Ex.

The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nPreliminarily, the Tribunal notes that the Parties' disagreement regarding the ECT's tax carve-out is limited to the question whether the Solar Levy constitutes a \"Taxation Measure\" within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and, as such, is excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the ECT. As the Respondent contends, the Claimant \"does not deny that the Tax Incentives provided for by the Act on Income Tax are \u2018taxation measures' covered by the carve-out,\" and that \"Claimant's only disagreement with the Czech Republic's analysis relates to the characterization \u2013 for purposes of the ECT \u2013 of the Acts that introduced and extended the Solar Levy as \"Taxation Measures,\"335 a proposition that the Respondent repeated at the Hearing336 and that the Claimant did not challenge at any time.\n\nRejoinder, para. 340.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 241:11-15 (\"You heard the Claimants accept that two of them, the repeal of the income tax holiday and the depreciation changes, are in fact taxation measures. So that leaves us really with the only issue of whether the solar levy is also a taxation measure.\").\n\n310.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal has little doubt that the Income Tax measures and the Shortened Depreciation fall within the ECT's tax carve-out. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts that it lacks jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims regarding those two measures under the ECT. The Tribunal's analysis is therefore limited to the question whether it has jurisdiction under the ECT over the Claimant's claims related to the Solar Levy.\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis begins with the burden of proof. The \"Taxation\" provision of the ECT relied upon by the Respondent is an exception to the more general provisions of the ECT. As such, it is clear that the Respondent bears the burden of proof of establishing that the Solar Levy may be characterized as a \"provision relating to taxes of the domestic law\" within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT.\n\n312.\n\nThis allocation of the burden of proof is consistent with the text of Article 21 of the ECT, which provides in relevant part: \"Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties.\" It is also consistent with the character of Taxation Measures as an exception to the more general terms of the ECT. The Respondent indeed does not dispute that it bears the burden of proof that the Solar Levy constitutes a \"tax\" or \"Taxation Measure\" within the meaning of Article 21.\n\n313.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondent has not discharged this burden of proof. As discussed below, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Solar Levy constitutes a \"tax\" as a matter of Czech law, as principally contended by the Respondent. Likewise, even apart from Czech law, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Solar Levy may be characterized as a tax or Taxation Measure within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT. As a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that it does not lack jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims related to the Solar Levy under the ECT on this ground.\n\n314.\n\nFirst, the Respondent's primary contention is that the Tribunal \"must look to the domestic law of the Czech Republic\"337 in determining whether the Solar Levy is a tax within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT. The Tribunal is satisfied that the application of the ECT's tax carve-out is conditional on the State invoking the Article 21 exception, characterizing the putative \"Taxation Measure\" as a tax in nature and substance as a matter of its domestic law.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 346; Counter-Memorial, paras. 408-413.\n\n315.\n\nIt is undisputed, and the Tribunal agrees, that Article 21 must be interpreted in accordance with the standards set out by the VCLT, particularly in its Article 31, and international law generally.338 This requires that effect be given to Article 21(7)'s *renvoi* to the domestic law of the Contracting Party invoking Article 21. Indeed, Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT refers expressly to a \"provision relating to taxes *of the domestic law* of the Contracting Party\" (emphasis added). The Tribunal shares the Respondent's view that this \"means necessarily that the relevant assessment must be made under the domestic law of the respondent State.\"339\n\nReply, para. 525; Rejoinder, para. 342.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 409.\n\n316.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the text of Article 21(7). It is, in the Tribunal's view, also consistent with Article 21's objective to permit, within the limits of the provision, Contracting Parties to carve-out measures from certain ECT standards \u2013 that is to \"exclude a taxation measure from the coverage of the standards of protection.\"340 Critically, however, unless a Contracting State has itself chosen to characterize a measure as a tax measure in its own domestic legal order, that measure does not fall within the scope of Article 21 of the ECT. In short, Article 21 applies, *prima facie*, only to those measures which constitute taxation measures within the legal order of the State invoking the Article 21 exception. (As discussed below, there are also international limits imposed by Article 21 on those measures which a Contracting State may define as tax measures as a matter of its domestic law, but this is a separate and subsequent issue.)\n\nU\u011fur Erman \u00d6zg\u00fcr (for the Energy Charter Secretariat), Taxation of Foreign Investments under International Law: Article 21 of the Energy Charter Treaty in Context, 2015, p. 20 (**Ex. CLA-116)**.\n\n317.\n\nApplying this analysis, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent has discharged its burden of proving that the Solar Levy was a tax as a matter of domestic Czech law. Rather, the expert evidence and other materials before the Tribunal indicate that the Solar Levy was regarded as a tax as a matter of Czech law only for certain limited purposes, but as something other than a tax for other, more significant, purposes. In the Tribunal's view, this is insufficient to justify a conclusion that the Solar Levy was characterized by Czech law as a tax within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT.\n\n318.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Solar Levy was titled just that \u2013 the \"Solar Levy\" \u2013 not the \"Solar Tax\" or the like. Where the inquiry is whether a measure is characterized as a tax or taxation measure under Czech law, it is of some significance that the measure was, in contrast to many other fiscal measures in the Czech Republic, not denominated by the Czech legislature as a tax. If this were the only consideration militating against characterization of the Solar Levy as a tax under Czech law, the Tribunal would be reluctant to attach dispositive weight to it. However, as discussed below, there are other, more substantial, considerations that point against characterization of the measure as a tax under Czech law.\n\n319.\n\nMost importantly, the Tribunal notes that the 10 July 2014 decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court held that, for double taxation purposes, the Solar Levy is not a tax under Czech law. The Court addressed the question whether, combined with the corporate income tax, the Solar Levy would have entailed an unlawful double taxation, and rejected that conclusion, holding that the Solar Levy was not a tax, but rather \"in nature\" a reduction of the government subsidy (FiT and Green Bonuses).341 The Supreme Administrative Court reasoned that \"[t]he subject of the [Solar Levy] is the amount resulting from the consideration of stipulating the amount of government support for this type of economic activity,\"342 which led it to conclude that the Solar Levy lacked the essential feature of \"non-equivalence,\" which in its view was necessary for categorization of the measure as a \"tax\" under Czech law.343\n\nDecision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, 10 July 2014, para. 20 (**Ex. CLA-2**).\n\nDecision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, 10 July 2014, para. 19 (**Ex. CLA-2**).\n\nDecision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, 10 July 2014, paras. 19-20 (**Ex. CLA-2**).\n\n320.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Czech Supreme Administrative Court was the Czech Republic's highest judicial authority on the (non-constitutional) questions it addressed regarding the nature of the Solar Levy. In its 10 July 2014 decision, the Court specifically addressed the nature and substance of the Solar Levy. The Tribunal has little doubt that this characterization was not an *obiter* statement, but a necessary element in the Court's holding.344 The Tribunal also notes that other judgments of Czech courts, including the Constitutional Court and Chambers of the Supreme Administrative Court have likewise found the Solar Levy to be, in essence, a reduction of the FiT, not a tax.345\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's argument that the Supreme Administrative Court's decision came in a \"single-paragraph *obiter* statement.\" On the contrary, as Respondent's expert acknowledged in cross-examination, this element of the Court's decision was both necessary to its holding and was elaborated upon in several points in the Court's judgment (Hearing Transcript (1 March 2017), 163:22-164:8).\n\nDecision of the Grand Chamber of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, Case No. 1 Afs 76/2013-57, 17 December 2013, para. 28 **(Annex 13 to First Fr\u00fdzek Report)**; Hal\u00ed\u010dek Report, para. 46; May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 45 **(CLA-12/R-110)**; Decision of the Czech Constitutional Court, Case No. 3211/13, 6 February 2014, para. 5 **(Annex 16 to First Fr\u00fdzek Report)**; Decision of the Czech Constitutional Court, Case No. 2216/14, 13 January 2015, para. 5 **(Annex 14 to First Fr\u00fdzek Report)**.\n\n321.\n\nGiven the foregoing authorities, the Tribunal would be very reluctant to adopt a different conclusion as to the nature and substance of the Solar Levy under Czech law. In particular, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the argument that the Czech legal system does not assign judicial decisions (or decisions by courts other than the Constitutional Court) *erga omnes* effect or recognise them as sources of law.346 That is not uncommon in civil law jurisdictions. More importantly, as the Respondent's expert conceded at the Hearing, the formal status and effect is in no way indicative of the interpretative authority that Supreme Administrative Court judgments have in the Czech domestic legal system: \"Although the decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court are not considered a formal source of law in the Czech Republic, as a civil law country which does not have the system of court precedents, an established and long-term adjudicator, which means case law, is usually considered to be an interpretative guide which may have a relatively high level of authority.\"347\n\nKot\u00e1b Report, para 81.\n\nHearing Transcript (1 March 2017), 140:18-141:1.\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that for the characterization of the Solar Levy in the Czech legal order, Czech judicial decisions, including those of the Supreme Administrative Court, offer the best available guidance, and it therefore attaches particular weight to them.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal draws further comfort in reaching this conclusion from the fact that the Respondent itself contended, through its Ministry of Finance, that the Solar Levy was not a tax in proceedings before the Czech courts. In particular, the Czech Finance Ministry argued before the Czech Constitutional Court that the Solar Levy was \"aimed to decrease the economic feed-in tariffs\"348 and that \"from the material perspective, the introduced measures [including the Solar Levy] are considered a reduction of subsidy\"349 In the Tribunal's view, these characterizations are entirely consistent with the Supreme Administrative Court's 10 July 2014 decision that the Solar Levy was a *de facto* reduction of the FiTs, rather than a tax.\n\nDetailed opinion of the Czech Ministry of Finance provided to the Constitutional Court in 2011 during the proceedings that led to decision No. 220/2012 Coll, para. 118 **(Annex 22 to Second Fr\u00fdzek Report)**.\n\nDecision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, 10 July 2014, paras. 19-20 (**Ex. CLA-2**).\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that it should attach comparable weight to the various decisions on which the Respondent relies to argue that the Solar Levy was a tax under Czech law. These judicial decisions focus on determining whether or not the Solar Levy is governed by the procedural and administrative provisions of the TAL and that it complies with the requirements of Article 11(5) of the Charter.350 It is undisputed that the TAL's definition of \"tax\" applies to a broad variety of public charges, including administrative fees, fines and other charges which are not commonly considered taxes under Czech law.351 It is also undisputed that Article 11(5) of the Charter is applicable not only to taxes, but also to fees.352 In light of the foregoing, in the Tribunal's view, these authorities only demonstrate that the Solar Levy was established in compliance with the Charter's legal constraints and administered in accordance with the TAL's procedural requirements, applicable to both taxes and other fees. In the Tribunal's view, these conclusions are certainly not dispositive of the proper characterization of the Solar Levy and they do not diminish the persuasiveness of the Supreme Administrative Court's 10 July 2014 decision in the present case.\n\nHal\u00ed\u010dek Report, paras. 47-48, May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, paras. 46, 59, 60, 64 **(Ex.

The Tribunal shares the Respondent's view that, in these particular circumstances, \"[a]cademic literature [\u2026] cannot be determinative as to whether a particular measure is legally a tax.\"353 The academic literature which addresses the nature and substance of the Solar Levy under Czech Law and which is relied on by the Parties fails to engage with a number of the above referenced judicial decisions.354 In these circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it should attach decisive weight to any of the academic commentary in the record, or that any of this commentary displaces the Supreme Administrative Court's characterization of the Solar Levy.\n\nRejoinder, para. 369.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., R. Boh\u00e1\u010d, \"Tax Revenues of Public Budgets in the Czech Republic\" (excerpt) **(Ex. R-318)**; Hearing Transcript (1 March 2017), 173:2-16.\n\n326.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent has discharged its burden of proving that the Solar Levy was characterized as a tax under Czech law. In its view, the weight of the evidence is that the Solar Levy was regarded as something other than a tax and was not supportive of a conclusion that it was a measure to which the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT is applicable.\n\n327.\n\nSecond, and independently, the Tribunal is also not persuaded that the Solar Levy is a tax or taxation measure within the limits contemplated by Article 21 of the ECT.\n\n328.\n\nAs discussed above, Article 21 excludes specified tax measures from the scope of the ECT, but only in so far as that measure is characterized as a tax measure under the domestic law of the State invoking the ECT's tax carve-out. Unless a measure is regarded as a tax measure by the State which has enacted it, and which relies upon it under Article 21, neither the text nor object and purpose of Article 21 are satisfied.\n\n329.\n\nIn addition, however, the Tribunal also concludes that a measure characterized as a taxation measure by a Contracting Party will only be excluded from the scope of the ECT, if it falls within the limits of legitimate regulatory measures provided by Article 21 of the ECT itself (as well as customary international law).355 In this regard, Article 21 imposes implicit limits on those measures which may be invoked by a Contracting Party under the ECT's tax carve-out. Accepting the existence of international limits on the Contracting Parties' right to exclude taxation measures from certain provisions of the ECT does not strip the Contracting Parties from one of their \"most quintessential sovereign powers.\"356 Instead, it acknowledges that any sovereign prerogative has its limits, which are, in the present case, imposed by the text and purposes of Article 21 of the ECT. The Contracting Parties are, of course, free to make use of their regulatory power and adopt measures in fiscal matters. They are, however, limited in their right to invoke such measures under the ECT.\n\nU\u011fur Erman \u00d6zg\u00fcr (for the Energy Charter Secretariat), Taxation of Foreign Investments under International Law: Article 21 of the Energy Charter Treaty in Context, 2015, p. 20 **(Ex. CLA-116)**.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 245:7-12.\n\n330.\n\nA contrary conclusion, that is, finding that the definition of tax measures in Article 21 of the ECT was not subject to any inherent limits, would empower Contracting Parties to define unilaterally which measures fall within the ECT's protective scope. The Tribunal does not consider that the drafters of Article 21 intended such a result. Moreover, this would contravene the object and purpose of the ECT, which is to establish uniform standards among the Contracting Parties. This is an aim to which Article 21 is clearly intended to be an exception, since its scope is specifically limited to tax measures. The Tribunal is persuaded that Article 21 imposes international limits on what may constitute a tax measure for these purposes.\n\n331.\n\nArticle 21's limits are necessarily implied as the provision itself does not set out an explicit international definition of \"Taxation measures.\" There is, however, no need for the Tribunal to provide a comprehensive definition. It suffices for the Tribunal to address the facets of Article 21's limits, which it considers relevant in the present case.\n\n332.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Article 21 was not intended to exclude from the ECT's scope measures the main objective of which was other than that of the raising of general revenue for the State,357 and which were formulated and structured as taxation measures for a particular ulterior reason (such as, here, reducing the risk of legal challenges).\n\n*Yukos*, paras. 1430-31 (Article 21 applies only to \"actions that are motivated for the purpose of raising general revenue for the State\"; actions taken \"to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose\" are not within Article 21) (**Ex. CLA-7)**. *See also* *Quasar de Valores SICAV S.A. et al. v. The Russian Federation*, Award, 20 July 2012, para. 179 (\"international law would likely become an illusion, as states would quickly learn to avoid responsibility by dressing up all adverse measures \u2026 as taxation\") **(Ex. CLA-11)**\n\n333.\n\nAlthough not dependent upon a finding of bad faith, this conclusion is consistent with the principle that treaty obligations must be interpreted, and performed, in good faith.358 The Tribunal shares the view that: \"The principle of good faith has long been recognized in public international law, as it is also in all national legal systems. This principle requires parties \u2018to deal honestly and fairly with each other, to represent their motives and purposes truthfully, and to refrain from taking unfair advantage \u2026' Nobody shall abuse the rights granted by treaties, and more generally, every rule of law includes an implied clause that it should not be abused.\"359\n\nArticle 31(1) VCLT (\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\").\n\n*Phoenix*, para. 107 **(Ex. RLA-1**).\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal considers these principles particularly significant under the ECT. The purpose of the ECT was to \"promote long-term cooperation in the energy field\"360 and the treaty was designed to promote transparency, fairness and stability. These considerations underscore the importance of good faith in the application of Article 21 to a Contracting Party's regulatory measures.\n\nArticle 2 of the ECT.\n\n335.\n\nIn light of these principles, the Tribunal takes the view that the Solar Levy falls outside the scope of Article 21 of the ECT. The Tribunal attaches particular weight to statements made at the time of the enactment of the Solar Levy, which clearly evidence that the Solar Levy's main objective was to reduce FiTs payable to certain solar energy producers, and not the general raising of state revenue. Importantly, these statements also evidence that the Solar Levy was structured, in many respects, as a tax for a particular reason, namely to avoid claims against the Czech Republic under the ECT. By way of example:\n\n(a) 23 September 2010 Emergency Coordination Committee: \"More stringent measures that would put the support of RES, and especially PVPP to an end\" gave rise to a \"risk of arbitration\"; Committee charged with deciding \"whether legal analysis of potential arbitrations with the assessment of risks and costs for the state budget if the proposal for more stringent measures is passed, e.g., *by adopting the change in the feed-in tariff for RES*.\"361\n\n(b) 15 October 2010 Emergency Coordination Committee: \"Deputy Environmental Minister B\u00edzkov\u00e1 stated that it is necessary to *find a formally correct mechanism for reduction of the support of RES from photovoltaic power plants*, such that it cannot be legally contested.\"362\n\n(c) 2 November 2010 Economic Committee of the Chamber of Deputies: \"The issue of arbitrations in general is absolutely erratic [sic]. [\u2026] I declare that it will *reduce the amount of intended support* to make it bearable for the Czech Republic and for electricity consumers in the Czech Republic. This method \u2013 through the withholding tax \u2013 is not just a retroactive correction of support. One may argue as to whether or not this is retroactive. Nonetheless, it is a similar situation as if you changed the conditions for investors by increasing the income tax. From the arbitration perspective, they will strive to advocate the principle on which the support for RES has been based, *i.e.*, their 15-year payback period [\u2026] the rest is the question of tax regimes \u2013 this is the responsibility of each country, and *changes in tax rates should not be challenged in arbitrations*.\"363\n\n(d) 29 November 2010 Senate Session: \"I would like to say that, explicitly, when it comes to the relation of taxes in contracts, in agreement on the protection and support of investments respectively, there is usually the clause explicitly exempting the tax issues from the contracted subjects.\"364\n\n(e) Ministry of Finance opinion to Czech Constitutional Court: \"The state uses the [Solar Levy] measures [\u2026] to regulate prices\"365 and \"Introduction of the levy [\u2026] is aimed to decrease the economic feed-in tariffs.\"366\n\n(f) Chairman of ERO: \"it would be appropriate to reduce the FiT for photovoltaic power plants [\u2026] much more but ERO was not allowed to do so.\"367\n\nInvitation and Minutes of 1st Meeting of Coordination Committee for the assessment of the impact of support of renewable energy sources on electricity prices, 23 September 2010, p. 5 (**Ex.

This is evidenced, in the Tribunal's view, by the unusually narrow class of persons subject to the Solar Levy; the method of calculating the Solar Levy; and the possibility that the Solar levy could not only be paid quarterly by the solar energy producers, but could also be withheld from the FiTs paid to those producers.\n\nFr\u00fdzek Hearing presentation, slide 7; Rejoinder, para 389.\n\n337.\n\nDespite this, the Solar Levy was structured, in a number of respects, to resemble a tax; as the Respondent correctly observes, the Solar Levy did not formally reduce the FiT, was imposed (like many taxes) on a specified base with specified rates and was collected pursuant to the TAL. In the Tribunal's view, however, the main reason for these characteristics, as evidenced by the statements quoted above, was an effort to bring the Solar Levy within the scope of Article 21 and thereby avoid the restrictions of the ECT.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal again notes the 10 July 2014 decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, and the submissions of the Czech Ministry of Finance to the Czech Constitutional Court, concluding that the Solar Levy was a *de facto* reduction of the FiTs payable to certain renewable energy producers. In the Tribunal's view, the Supreme Administrative Court's analysis is persuasive: for the reasons outlined above, the main focus of the Solar Levy was the reduction of certain FiTs, as evidenced by both the measure's structure and the parliamentary statements made in connection with its enactment.\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that this case does not involve conduct comparable to that in *RoslnvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,* and *Quasar de Valores v. The Russian Federation*. There is no suggestion that the Respondent used its tax authority to target political opponents, to seize control of major economic enterprises or to accomplish objectives unrelated to fiscal and budgetary issues. The Respondent's conduct here is simply not of the same character, and it did not act abusively, duplicitously or with similar bad faith.\n\n340.\n\nHaving said this, as discussed above, the nature and objectives of the Solar Levy are such that it does not fall within the definition of a tax measure under Article 21. As its structure and legislative history make clear, the Solar Levy was not designed primarily to raise revenue, but instead to reduce the FiTs for a specific set of renewable energy producers, with the Solar Levy being structured, in many respects, as a tax in an attempt to reduce the risk of legal challenges. This was not the purpose of the ECT. If the Solar Levy were to be exempted from the scope of the ECT, the treaty's object and purposes would be materially frustrated.\n\n**D. THE CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot bring a claim for the entirety of SolarOne's shares since, in November 2009, prior to the adoption of the contested measures, a 10% stake had been transferred to Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd.369 The Respondent contends that the Claimant, which characterises its claims as relating to damages suffered by its own investment inclusive of a 10% call option in SolarOne (the \"**Call Option**\"), cannot bring a claim in respect of the 10% SolarOne stake held by Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd.370\n\nRejoinder, para. 485.\n\nRejoinder, para. 486, *referring to* Impregilo S.p.A. v.

RLA-15**) (\"***Impregilo***\").\n\n342.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Call Option is not an investment under the ECT; it does not qualify as a \"form of equity participation\" as set out in Article 1(6) of the ECT, because it does not involve actual ownership but only creates a right to potential ownership, as the Claimant itself acknowledges.371 The Call Option neither involves a contribution nor risk, since the purpose of a call option is precisely to eliminate risk as to return on investment.372 In addition, referring to the decision in *Yukos*, among others, the Respondent submits that even if it were accepted that a call option is an investment, the Call Option is merely a contingent right, since no transfer of ownership resulted from the November 2009 transfer agreement, relied upon by the Claimant.373 The Respondent also argues that an abuse of process would take place, through exercise of the Call Option after the dispute arose, if the Tribunal were to exercise jurisdiction over the 10% stake in SolarOne.374\n\nRejoinder, para. 489.\n\nRejoinder, para. 490.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 492, 493, *referring to* *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v.

RLA-317**) (\"***Yukos Award on Jurisdiction***\").\n\nRejoinder, paras. 494, 495.\n\n343.\n\nAs for the Claimant's remaining 90% stake in SolarOne (the \"**90% stake**\"), which encompasses half of the damages claimed in this arbitration, the Respondent argues that, on the assumption that a protected investment was made, no obligation would have been owed continuously to date to the Claimant under the ECT.375 Since the Claimant's shares were transferred to Mr. Jan \u010cern\u00fd, a Czech national and one of the Claimant's shareholders, on 25 May 2016, claims in connection with any injury to SolarOne resulting from breaches allegedly committed after that date fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Thus, the Tribunal jurisdiction is confined to claims for injury suffered by the Claimant, if any, while it owned SolarOne.376\n\nRejoinder, paras. 496-498.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 494-503.\n\n**2. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimant states that it is asserting claims in respect of damages suffered by its own investment in the form of a Call Option, and thus, contrary to the Respondent's contention, not on behalf of Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd.377\n\nReply, paras. 616-619.\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Call Option is a protected investment under the ECT. This follows not only from the text of the ECT, but additionally in light of the fact that the Call Option exhibits the features which the Respondent attributes to an investment, such as economic value and the assumption of risk. No abuse of process would be involved, since the Call Option had been acquired even before the dispute became foreseeable.378\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 201-208.\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that its claim is not confined to the shares owned at the time of adoption of the challenged measures since, pursuant to the plain language of Article 1(6) of the ECT, the Call Option is a protected investment, regardless of the fact that the option concerns shares that the Claimant \"may eventually come to own\".379 The Claimant argues that the Call Option involved neither uncertainty as to its exercise nor a contractual performance contingent on the mere will of the Claimant.380 The Claimant further contends that the exercise of the Call Option was not barred by the prohibition on \"company chains\", abrogated on 1 January 2014.381\n\nReply, para. 620.\n\nReply, para. 621-622.\n\nReply, para. 623.\n\n347.\n\nAs for the remaining 90% interest in SolarOne, the Claimant argues that, as of 1 January 2011 (the valuation date), it is undisputed that it had a protected investment which was breached upon implementation of the challenged measures.According to the Claimant, the 25 May 2016 sale does not impinge on the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the 90% stake, nor preclude the Claimant's entitlement to damages arising out of the breach, which encompasses the effects of the measures thereafter, including both \"by\" and \"after\" the date of the award.382\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 209-212.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision regarding this aspect of the controversy is divided into two parts, concerning the Call Option, on the one hand, and the remaining 90% stake in SolarOne, on the other hand.\n\n*Regarding the Call Option*\n---------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Parties are divided as to the character of the Call Option as an investment. Given the analysis earlier in this Award, the Tribunal need only make a finding as to the character of the Call Option as an investment pursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT, having decided that it lacks jurisdiction to consider the Claimant's claims under the BIT.\n\n350.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that call options are not included among the classes of investment expressly enumerated in Article 1(6) of the ECT. The Tribunal, therefore, has to determine whether the Call Option constitutes a \"kind of asset\", for the purposes of the chapeau to Article 1(6) of the ECT.\n\n351.\n\nArticle 1(6) of the ECT does not provide a definition of \"asset\". Taking into account the text of the remainder of Article 1(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal further notes that the classes of investments enumerated in the provision comprise, among others, several kinds of rights, including rights whereby a person is entitled to participate in a company or business, including in the form of equity participation. According to the second paragraph of Article 1(6) of the ECT, the form of an asset does not affect its character as an investment. Thus, the main attribute applicable to any asset not expressly enumerated and described in the text is that it shall have been invested, regardless of the form of such investment. From the above, the Tribunal concludes that an \"asset\" comprises any right invested by an investor, regardless of the form of the investment and any changes thereto.\n\n352.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers it apt to determine, first, whether a call option is an asset. In this regard, the conclusions of the tribunal in *Yukos* in relation to call options are of assistance.383 The *Yukos* tribunal concluded that the call options at issue did not bear upon its determination regarding ownership of, and control over, the shares in question.384 In particular, \"[n]o transfer of property will have occurred unless and until the option is exercised, but until it is (and it may never be) all property remains with the grantor of the option\".385 The Tribunal agrees with this broad observation. A call option is a right which, unless exercised, has no bearing upon the matter of ownership of another right, including a right constitutive of an asset within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT. Importantly, a call option is ancillary in character: its object is not the making of an investment. Rather it is the asset actually invested (*i.e*,*.* the subject of the call option) that is the principal right constitutive of an investment under Article 1(6) of the ECT.\n\n*Yukos* Award on Jurisdiction, paras. 436, 459-460, 499-500, 510, 525, 527-528 (**Ex. RLA-317**).\n\n*Yukos* Award on Jurisdiction, para. 528 (**Ex. RLA-317**).\n\n*Yukos* Award on Jurisdiction, para. 527 (**Ex. RLA-317**).\n\n353.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Call Option is not an asset invested by the Claimant and, thus, falls outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n*Regarding the 90% stake in SolarOne*\n-------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Parties' difference regarding damages allegedly caused to the Claimant's 90% stake in SolarOne.\n\n355.\n\nThe Respondent contests the character of the 90% stake as a protected investment after 25 May 2016 when the Claimant's shares were transferred to Mr. Jan \u010cern\u00fd. In particular, the Respondent contests the Tribunal's jurisdiction over any alleged damage to the 90% stake caused on or after 25 May 2016, since following the transfer of the 90% stake on this date, so it is said, no obligation was owed anymore to the Claimant under the ECT. The Tribunal observes that, notwithstanding its contention as to the abscence of any protected investment, the Respondent accepts that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over measures (if any) that caused injury to the Claimant's 90% stake on or prior to 25 May 2016. The Claimant argues that its 90% stake does constitute a protected investment; that a breach took place as of the date of valuation, namely 1 January 2011; and that the alleged breach has a continuing effect beyond 25 May 2016, including any damages which might be suffered by, or after, the date of issuance of this Tribunal's award.\n\n356.\n\nAs for its jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, the Tribunal recalls its observations regarding Article 1(6) of the ECT. As pointed out above, its finding in relation to the 90% stake has to be based exclusively on the ECT, having decided that it lacks jurisdiction to consider the Claimant's claims under the BIT.\n\n357.\n\nPursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal is of the view that the 90% stake does constitute a protected investment under the ECT. In particular, as opposed to the ancillary nature of call options, the 90% stake is an asset constitutive of the principal right owned by the Claimant as a protected investor under the ECT. The Tribunal, thus, has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the 90% stake.\n\n358.\n\nAs for its jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, the Tribunal addresses the Parties' arguments relating to injury allegedly suffered before and on or after 25 May 2016.\n\n359.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, there is no dispute that claims concerning any measures allegedly committed by the Claimant prior to 25 May 2016 fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n360.\n\nWith respect to claims for injury allegedly caused to the 90% stake on or after 25 May 2016, the Tribunal notes that, as held by the tribunal in *Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, it is necessary to distinguish between \"jurisdiction *ratione temporis* [\u2026] and the applicability *ratione temporis* of the substantive obligations contained\" in the respective investment treaty.386 In light of this distinction, and on a proper analysis, the Tribunal considers that what is at issue is not the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, but the applicability of relevant substantive obligations under the ECT. Furthermore, the Tribunal considers that questions as to jurisdiction are to be distinguished from those relating to the merits of the dispute, including the character of a breach as continuing, and the applicability and content of treaty provisions setting out obligations allegedly breached.\n\n*Impregilo*, para. 309 (**Ex. RLA-15**).\n\n361.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the basis of the 25 May 2016 transfer of the 90% stake. The Tribunal considers that, to the extent that the 90% stake was owned by the Claimant, both at the time of the alleged measures forming the basis of the claims and at the time of commencement of the present proceedings on 22 April 2014, the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over any alleged injury suffered on or after 25 May 2016. The real question which divides the Parties is how the Tribunal should deal with the injury allegedly caused after the transfer of the 90% stake. For the Tribunal, its jurisdiction on the matter is without prejudice to its determinations as to the applicability and content of substantive provisions of the ECT.\n\n362.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the 90% stake, without prejudice to its determinations as to the applicability and content of treaty provisions setting out obligations owed to the Claimant in relation to injury allegedly caused to the Claimant on or after 25 May 2016.\n\n**E. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN EU INVESTORS AND EU MEMBER STATES**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nOn 6 March 2018, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**ECJ**\" or \"**CJEU**\") rendered its judgment in *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*.387 In the operative part of the judgment, the ECJ ruled that:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.388\n\n*Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, ECJ Judgment, Case C-284/16, 6 March 2018 **(Ex. RLA-349)** (\"***Achmea*** **judgment**\").\n\n*Achmea* judgment, para. 62 **(Ex. RLA-349)**.\n\n364.\n\nArticle 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\") provides:\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:\n\n(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;\n\n(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;\n\nWhere such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.\n\nWhere any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.\n\nIf such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act with the minimum of delay.\n\n365.\n\nArticle 344 of the TFEU reads:\n\nMember States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.\n\n366.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the impact of the *Achmea* judgment on this Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal \"has no jurisdiction to hear the captioned matters because the [Respondent's] consent to arbitration under the relevant treaties is ineffective under applicable EU law, as conclusively determined in the *Achmea* Judgment.\"389 The Claimant contends that \"the *Achmea* judgment does not affect [the Tribunal's] jurisdiction.\"390\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 167.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 222.\n\n367.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal invited submissions from the Parties on the following issues:\n\n1. Whether the *Achmea* judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the present proceedings;\n\n2. Whether and how the *Achmea* judgment applies in arbitrations where the arbitral seat is outside of the EU, including in particular the impact, if any, of Article 344 TFEU on the validity of an intra-EU BIT jurisdiction clause for an arbitral tribunal sitting outside of the EU;\n\n3. Whether and how the *Achmea* judgment applies to the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\n4. Whether and how the *Achmea* judgment actually impacts upon the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal sitting outside of the EU, as distinct from the enforceability of awards within the EU;\n\n5. How the *Achmea* judgment fits in, if at all, with Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties;\n\n6. The relevance of Articles 27 and 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties for the present arbitrations;\n\n7. How Swiss courts and Swiss scholarship have considered the position of EU law in a legal universe consisting of international law and domestic law;\n\n8. The impact, if any, of Article 177(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law; and\n\n9. The role of waiver / estoppel, including in light of Article 186(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law, in this context.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the aforementioned questions were put to the Parties in each of the four coordinated arbitrations in PCA Case Nos. 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-20 and 2014-22, independent of whether the Tribunal found jurisdiction under the BIT in each respective case. Although not all of the Parties' submissions may be equally relevant in a case where the Tribunal declines jurisdiction under the BIT for other reasons, the Tribunal has decided for purposes of consistency to set out summaries of the Parties' answers to all questions below.\n\n**1. Whether the** ***Achmea*** **judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the present proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the *Achmea* judgment is not limited to the specific wording of Article 8 of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic-Netherlands BIT (\"**CSFR-Netherlands BIT**\") at issue before the ECJ, but extends to similar provisions in other investment treaties, including the ECT.391 This is because the question answered by the ECJ in *Achmea* \"was worded to cover, in a general manner, investor-State provisions \u2018in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT).'\"392\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 60-62, *referring to* *Achmea* judgment, paras. 31, 56, 62 **(Ex.

RLA-349)**.\n\n370.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent notes that the wording of *Achmea* applies to \"(i) \u2018any provision in an international agreement' (ii) \u2018concluded between EU Member States' (iii) \u2018under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal.\"393 As Article 26 of the ECT fulfils these criteria, the *Achmea* judgment is also applicable to this case.\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 24, *referring to* *Achmea* judgment, paras. 61-62 **(Ex. RLA-349)**.\n\n371.\n\nIn the Respondent's submission, the \"provisions at issue in this proceeding also are squarely captured by the ECJ's underlying *ratio decidendi*\" in *Achmea*.394 Specifically, the Respondent takes the view that the need to protect the effectiveness of EU law by disallowing \"any \u2018outsourcing' to non-EU judicial fora of disputes that are capable of pertaining \u2013 even potentially \u2013 to regulatory and legislative powers of the EU and its Member States in matters coming within the scope of EU law\" applies to any arbitration clauses similar to Article 8 of the CSFR-Netherlands BIT.395 Such clauses undermine the autonomy of EU law, because (1) the disputes which the tribunal in question is called on to resolve \"are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law\"; (2) the tribunal is not \"situated within the judicial system of the EU,\" and, in particular, cannot \"be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU\"; and (3) an award made by such a tribunal is not \"subject to review by a court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary ruling.\"396\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 25.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 63-64, *referring to* *Achmea* judgment, paras. 32-37, 43, 57 **(Ex.

RLA-349)**.\n\n372.\n\nThe Respondent thus argues that Article 26 of the ECT is equally incompatible with EU law as it may also require the Tribunal to interpret or apply EU law in resolving the dispute.397 The Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that EU law would not be relevant to the present dispute, because the treaty does not contain an express choice of law provision.398 The Respondent highlights that the treaty is not a \"self-contained legal framework, isolated from international and domestic law\"399 and that the Tribunal has to decide the dispute on the basis of all relevant rules of international law, including the TFEU.400\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 67-71, 76.\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 10-12.\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 13, *referring to* *BG Group Plc. v.

RLA-432)**.\n\n375.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the Claimant's argument that this Tribunal should disregard the ECJ's treaty interpretation in *Achmea* in favour of an interpretation that is in line with international law principles of treaty interpretation and rely on \"better reasoned\"405 parts of the Opinion of the Advocate General Wathelet.406\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 30, *referring to* Claimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 35, 5657, 68.\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 31.\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the *Achmea* judgment \"is not dependent on the specific wording of the CSFR-Netherlands BIT [and] applies with equal force\" to this arbitration,407 and that \"there can be no doubt that the BIT's dispute resolution clause [is] in conflict with the TFEU.\"408\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 82.\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para 37.\n\n**(b) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimant summarizes its position as follows:\n\nThe *Achmea* judgment concerned a BIT, the CSFR-Netherlands BIT, under which EU law was applicable law pursuant to its choice-of-law clause. Unlike that BIT, the BITs invoked by the Claimants do not contain any such clause.409\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 213; Claimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 17.\n\n378.\n\nFor the Claimant, the *Achmea* judgment only applies to instances in which a tribunal may have to decide on substantive issues of EU law. In contrast, in the present dispute, EU law is not part of the applicable law. Therefore, an interpretation of EU law by the Tribunal \"cannot have the effect of compromising the effectiveness of EU law\", especially considered that the Tribunal is seated outside of the EU.410\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 17-19.\n\n379.\n\nThe Claimant stresses that the present dispute cannot be decided on the basis of EU law. Since the ECT \"do[es] not refer to it, either directly or indirectly\", EU law does not qualify as \"customary international law and general principles of law\" forming the lex generalis of the dispute.411 For the Claimant, EU law is only relevant in the present dispute as a rule of interpretation under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.412 The Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that, even in the absence of an express choice of law clause, EU law may still form part of the applicable international law.413\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 9-10, *referring to* Claimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 22.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 9-11.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 11.\n\n380.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the *Achmea* judgment is \"deeply flawed\" since the ECJ \"fails to consider the basic international law principles of treaty interpretation, and in particular the one of \u2018systemic integration' embedded in Article 31(3)(c) VCLT\".414 Therefore, according to the Claimant, no authority can be accorded to the ECJ's conclusion that intra-EU BITs conflict with EU law.415 In particular, the ECJ's holding in *Achmea* is incorrectly based on the potential, rather than on the actual, application of EU law on the part of the Tribunal,.416 Additionally, the ECJ wrongly affirmed that the *Achmea* tribunal would have been unable to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ.417 The ECJ in *Achmea* could instead have \"avoided a conflict of norms by recognizing that intra-EU BIT tribunals qualify as courts or tribunals of EU Member States under Article 267 TFEU.\"418 In any event, no interpretation of EU law arises out of this dispute that could be referred to the ECJ, as the issue of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is a matter of international law.419 Finally, the ECJ's reasoning concerning \"the alleged limited review of intra-EU BIT awards under national law and on a supposed distinction with commercial arbitration\" is flawed, as the principle of party autonomy is the basis of both investment treaty and commercial arbitration.420\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 48.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 213.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 54-55.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 56-57.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 23-24.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 24.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 58.\n\n381.\n\nThe Claimant emphasises that the Tribunal is not asked to \"second-guess the Court\", but rather to \"ensure that the relation between EU law and international treaties is viewed not through the prism of the primacy of EU law but under general international law, which does not endorse such primacy\".421 According to the Claimant, it follows that Articles 344 and 267 TEFU, on their ordinary meaning, do not prohibit investor-State arbitration.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 25.\n\n382.\n\nIn any case, the Clamant submits that \"even if EU law were applicable law under the [ECT] (*quod non*), it would only be so in relation to merit issues.\"422 The Claimant argues that the alleged conflict between EU law and investment treaties is one of jurisdiction, connected to states' consent to arbitration.423 As the Tribunal's jurisdiction derives from the ECT, which does not refers explicitly to EU law, the Tribunal is not bound by the *Achmea* judgment. In the absence of \"a clear positive rule of EU law prohibiting arbitration between an EU Member State and a national of another EU Member State\",424 the Tribunal should decide whether a conflict between the ECT and EU law exists only on the basis of international law.425\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 12.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 12.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 69; Claimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 12.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 62; Claimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 9-12.\n\n**2.

RLA-349)**.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 89.\n\n384.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the ECJ decided that arbitral proceedings lack adequate safeguards to ensure the \"full effectiveness of EU law\", notwithstanding the fact that the arbitration giving rise to the *Achmea* judgment had its seat in Germany, an EU Member State. This reasoning, so argues the Respondent, applies *a fortiori* to this arbitration, in which the Tribunal's award will be subject to review by the courts of a non-EU country (*i.e.*, Switzerland).429\n\nRespondent's Comments, para. 88, *referring to* *Achmea* judgment, paras. 50-56 **(Ex. RLA-349)**.\n\n**(b) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the arguments elaborated in its answer to Question 1 \"are even more pertinent, because the seat of these arbitrations is in Switzerland, outside the EU.\" From the Swiss law perspective, EU law is *res inter alios acta* and in no way can be accorded primacy over international law. Under Swiss international arbitration law, the *Achmea* judgment is irrelevant to assess the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\"430 According to the Claimant, the ECJ in *Achmea* recognizes that the principle of effectiveness of EU law is limited to the territory of EU Member States.431\n\nClaimant's Comments, para. 214. *See also* Claimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 19.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 19, *referring to* *Achmea* judgment, para. 34 **(Ex.

Specifically, the Respondent notes that, as also confirmed in the *Mox Plant* decision in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\"**UNCLOS**\"), Article 344 TFEU \"applies squarely\" to multilateral treaties to which the EU is a party.437 For the Respondent, a treaty involving the EU as a contracting party poses a greater threat to the autonomy of EU law than treaties not involving the EU, because such treaty becomes part of EU law.438 Therefore (1) \"any dispute about the interpretation and application of the ECT within EU Member States automatically constitutes a dispute about the interpretation and application of EU law\"; (2) \"the ECT cannot be applied as between EU Member States to the extent it is contrary to the EU Treaties\"; and (3) \"in accordance with Article 344 of the TFEU, EU Member States may not submit disputes concerning the ECT to non-EU dispute resolution bodies.\"439\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 43-44, *referring to Mox Plant* (Commission v.

On this basis, it rejects the Claimant's contention that the situation in this arbitration is different from that found in *Achmea*.440\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 95-96, *referring to* Claimant's letter to the Tribunal, 13 April 2018, pp. 3-4.\n\n390.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that the *dictum* in the *Achmea* judgment, which states that:\n\nIt is true that, according to settle-cased law of the Court, an international agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected [\u2026].441\n\nis concerned only with \"the possibility for the EU to subject itself to non-EU jurisdictions\".442 Hence, it does not apply to this arbitration, which concerns a dispute settlement mechanism included in an agreement concluded between EU Member States.443\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 105, *referring* *Achmea* judgment, paras. 57-58 **(Ex.

The Republic of Hungary* \u2013 which found that, in case of incompatibility, EU law previails over the ECT's substantive protections \u2013, and disregard the reasoning in *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain* \u2013 which held that *Achmea* does not apply to multilateral treaties such as the ECT. For the Respondent, *Masdar* lacks \"any analysis of relevant EU law\".446\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 91, *referring to Jean-Claude Levy*, ECJ Judgment, Case C-158/91, 2 August 1993, paras. 12-13 **(Ex.

The accession of the Czech Republic to the EU in 2004 pre-empted incompatible previous agreements and their conflict clauses.447 Nor can Article 16 of the ECT prevail over Article 351 of the TFEU as *lex specialis*, because the principle of primacy plays such a central role in the legal system of the EU that it would be \"manifestly absurd [and] unreasonable\" to assume that EU Member States would have \"deliberately signed [it] away\" by joining the ECT.448\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 48.\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 51.\n\n**(b) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal must base its decision on international law rather than on EU law.449 Questions of jurisdiction in ECT proceedings can only be decided on the basis of the ECT's terms and they do not give priority to EU law over the ECT.450 In the absence of a choice of law clause providing for the applicability of EU law to this dispute, any jurisdictional conflict between EU law and the ECT must therefore be resolved in favor of the ECT.451\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 13-15, 43.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 15, 71, *referring to to* *Vattenfall AB et al. v.

The potential unenforceability of this Tribunal's award within the EU is irrelevant for jurisdiction under Swiss law.\"466\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 216.\n\n**5. How the** ***Achmea*** **judgment fits in, if at all, with Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 59 of the VCLT is of no relevance to this case, because the *Achmea* judgment concerns specific provisions of intra-EU investment treaties and not the treaties as a whole.467\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 121-122.\n\n404.\n\nIn contrast, Article 30 of the VCLT, which codifies the principle of *lex posterior*, is \"perfectly consistent\" with the *Achmea* judgment. Unlike Article 59, Article 30 of the VCLT applies to specific treaty provisions, *i.e.*, those enabling investment arbitration, and not the treaty as a whole.468 The Respondent also notes that the \"same subject matter\" requirement in Article 30 VCLT \"should not [\u2026] be interpreted restrictively or applied at the level of the treaty as a whole.\"469 Instead, it should be deemed satisfied when \"(i) a certain course of conduct attracts the application of two different treaties and; (ii) the fulfillment of an obligation under one treaty affects the fulfillment of obligations under, or undermines the object and purpose of, the other treaty\",470 According to the Respondent, this is presently the case:471 as both investment treaties and the EU Treaties are concerned with intra-EU investment activities, it can reasonably be expected that issues of EU law will arise in investor-State arbitration.472 The applicability of Article 30 of the VCLT thus ensures the prevalence of the later treaty, the TFEU, over the earlier investment treaty.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 123.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 128, *referring to* International Law Commission, Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, 2006, p. 112, paras. 21 **-** 22 **(Ex.

Instead, the two regimes constitute \"part and parcel of the same European legal regime that was intended to increase economic integration and prosperity in Europe.\"\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 54.\n\n407.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that both Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the VCLT render the investor-State arbitration provisions in this proceeding inapplicable.478\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 138.\n\n**(b) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"Articles 59 and 30 VCLT are not applicable for the resolution of the (apparent) conflict at issue, because the treaties invoked by the Claimant and the EU Treaties do not have the same \u2018subject matter'.\"479 In support of its position, the Claimant cites previous awards holding that investment treaties:\n\n(i) have a different and more specific *objective* than the EU Treaties, *i.e.* to protect foreign investors and investments, (ii) provide broader *substantive* protection non-equivalent to that available under the EU Treaties, for instance with reference to the FET standard, and (iii) provide a *fundamental* procedural protection, *i.e.* investor-state arbitration, with no parallel in the EU Treaties.480\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 217. *See also* Claimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 81-84; Claimant's Reply on *Achmea*, paras. 36-37.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 82, *referring to* *Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v.

The relevance of Articles 27 and 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties for the present arbitrations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Articles 27 and 46 VCLT are of no relevance in this case, as the Respondent is not invoking its internal law to justify its position, but rather \"a fundamental incompatibility between successive international treaties [\u2026] between the same contracting parties\" in accordance with Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the VCLT.489\n\nRespondent's Comments, para. 142.\n\n413.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that the broad scope of EU law obligations, which also include \"doctrines developed by the ECJ, such as primacy, direct effect, effectiveness\" does not transform the law created by EU treaties into national law.490 The Respondent highlights that the Claimant itself confirmed in its submission on *Achmea* the international nature of EU law.491\n\nRespondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 7, *referring to Vattenfall* Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, para. 145 (**Ex.

In fact, EU law, despite its international character, is deeply integrated into the domestic law of the Czech Republic, of which it is an integral part.492\n\nClaimant's Comments, para. 218.\n\n415.\n\nOn this point, the Claimant contends that EU law can be characterized as either international or national law. Its national law character stems from the fact that \"EU law gives rise to a special legal order deeply integrated into the one of its Member States.\"493 Therefore, \"for the purposes of Articles 27 and 46 VCLT, internal law includes [supranational] EC law.\"494\n\nClaimant's Comments, para. 93.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 95.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant thus holds that the Respondent's position that \"\u2018the \"integration of the [\u2026] TFEU into domestic legal systems is no \u2018deeper' than that of any other treaty-based international law' ignores the special features of EU law that make it a sub-regime of international law\",495 in particular \"its primacy over, and direct effect on, the Member States' internal laws.\"496\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 7, *referring to* Respondent's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 7.\n\nClaimant's Reply on *Achmea*, para. 7, *referring to* K.

Benetton International* that EU competition law (*i.e.*, Article 101 of the TFEU) is \"a matter of EU public policy to be applied by commercial arbitral tribunals\".505\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 150, *referring to* Swiss Federal Tribunal, Case No. 4P.278/2005, BGE 132 III 389, Judgment, 8 March 2008 **(Ex.

Instead, customary international law and general principles of law are part of Swiss law as international law within the meaning of Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution, and preclude giving primacy to EU law.\n\n421.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution provides that the Swiss Confederation and the Swiss cantons have to comply with international law norms that are binding upon Switzerland. Those norms do not include EU law, as Switzerland is not an EU Member State.510 The fact that Switzerland has entered into several bilateral agreements with the EU, and that it has unilaterally enacted domestic laws based on EU law, does not \"give EU law a special status in Swiss law.\"511 That said, the Claimant acknowledges that \"interpretation [of Swiss law] in harmony with EU law has been understandably considered preferable where possible\",512 as long as it would serve Switzerland's own economic interests in terms of its nationals' competitiveness within the EU market.513 Accordingly, the Claimant submits that, in general, \"Switzerland takes no stance towards the general harmonization of EU law [as it is] not a policy concern for Switzerland.\"514\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 127-129.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 130.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 130.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 131.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 131.\n\n422.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's position that the Tribunal must apply mandatory EU law, lest its award may be set aside, is wrong for two reasons.515 First, pursuant to Article 19 of the PILA, \"there is no basis for the assertion that an arbitral tribunal seated in Switzerland is obliged to apply foreign mandatory rules.\"516 Second, \"it is undisputed that the failure of a Swiss-seated tribunal to apply such rules, or to apply them correctly, is not a ground for setting aside an award pursuant to Article 190(2)(b)\".517\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 134.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 150.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 150, *referring to* Swiss Federal Tribunal, Case No. 4P.115/1994, Judgment, December 30, 1994, para. 2c **(Ex.

The impact, if any, of Article 177(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nArticle 177(2) of the PILA provides:\n\nIf a party to the arbitration agreement is a state or an enterprise or organization controlled by it, it cannot rely on its own law in order to contest its capacity to be a party to an arbitration or the arbitrability of a dispute covered by the arbitration agreement.\n\n**(a) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the goal of Article 177(2) of the PILA \"is to prevent a State from abusing *its own* sovereign legislative or executive powers\".518 The provision prohibits a State or its organ acting as a respondent before a Swiss-seated international arbitration tribunal from invoking its domestic law to contest the validity of the arbitration agreement on grounds of non-arbitrability or lack of capacity.519 Against this background, the provision thus does not apply \"where the relevant legal change is outside a Party's control.\"520 As the *Achmea* judgment is not attributable to the Respondent, Article 177(2) of the PILA is not applicable.521\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 155, *referring to* Swiss Federal Tribunal, Case No. 4P.126/1992, Judgment, 13 October 1992, pp. 68-78, para. 7b **(Ex.

RLA-407)**.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 156.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 157-158.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, pursuant to Article 119 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the arbitration clause contained in the ECT should be deemed extinguished and inoperative, as the performance of the obligation to arbitrate has become impossible due to circumstances not attributable to the party.522\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 156, 158, *referring to* Swiss Code of Obligations, 30 March 1911 **(Ex. RLA-410)**. Article 119(1) provides: \"An obligation is deemed extinguished where its performance is made impossible by circumstances not attributable to the obligor.\"\n\n**(b) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n426.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article 177(2) is applicable in this case:523\n\nThe arguments that are sought to be drawn from the *Achmea* judgment by the Czech Republic relate to the \"arbitrability\" of the dispute. This matter is governed by Article 177(1) PILA [Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law], which denies any role to non-Swiss law, including EU law, for arbitrability. Arbitrability is to be assessed exclusively pursuant to Swiss law, according to which the present dispute is fully arbitrable. As regards the arbitrability of the dispute under Swiss law, it is irrelevant that the award to be rendered by this Tribunal may be unenforceable within EU Member States. It follows that, from a Swiss law perspective, the *Achmea* judgment is completely irrelevant.\n\nArticle 177(2) PILA prohibits a State from relying on its \"*own law*\" to contest its \"*capacity to be a party to an arbitration or the arbitrability of a dispute covered by the arbitration agreement*\". In light of Article 177(1) PILA, which already deals with arbitrability ratione materiae and applies to both private and public parties, Article 177(2) PILA is generally considered superfluous. Be as it may, in the present case it precludes the Czech Republic from relying on EU law, which is clearly its \"own law\".524\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 143.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 220.\n\n427.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's arguments are meritless. First, the relevant EU law is \"internal law\" of the Respondent. Thus, the Respondent cannot argue that the *Achmea* judgment is not attributable to itself.525 As for the impossibility argument under Article 119 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Claimant contends that \"there is no physical impossibility to perform the arbitration agreement\". Also, the legal impossibility under the provision does not include the arbitrability issue, as such issue is \"exclusively governed by the substantive rule of Article 177 [of the PILA]\".526\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 145.\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 146-147, *referring to* B.

The role of waiver/estoppel, including in light of Article 186(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law, in this context**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nArticle 186(2) of the PILA provides:\n\nAny objection to [the Tribunal's] jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defense on the merits.\n\n**(a) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 186(2) of the PILA \"only applies to objectively arbitrable matters.\"527 In cases where the subject matter of the dispute is non-arbitrable, the Respondent contends, the failure to raise a jurisdictional objection in a timely manner does not lead to the foreclosure of such objection and the arbitral tribunal should examine the question of arbitrability *ex officio*, given that \"[a] party cannot waive a right that it did not have.\"528 According to the *Achmea* judgment, which is an \"expression of EU mandatory provisions\", intra-EU investor-State disputes are objectively non-arbitrable; such non-arbitrability cannot be waived and must therefore be considered *ex officio* by this Tribunal.529\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 159, *referring to* Swiss Federal Tribunal, Case No 4A\\_12/2107, Judgment, 19 September 2017, para. 3.2.2.1 **(Ex.

In addition to all the other reasons, the Respondent's request that these cases be dismissed on the basis of the intra-EU jurisdictional objection should be rejected because, under both international law and Swiss law, the Czech Republic (i) waived the right to raise such objection; and (ii) is estopped from raising it.533\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 221.\n\n432.\n\nThe Claimant observes that \"waiver is a well-established principle of international law which has been consistently been applied by the ICJ\".534 A waiver is effective if it meets these conditions:\n\n(i) there must be a declaration or statement; (ii) made by a competent authority; (iii) of the State whose rights are affected by the waiver; (iv) made in the context of a claim/dispute; (v) not affected by individuality; and (vi) not revocable.535\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 156-160, *referring to Nuclear Tests Case* (New Zealand v.

The present dispute is thus arbitrable under Swiss law, so says the Claimant, and whether it is arbitrable under EU law is irrelevant.547 With reference to academic commentary, the Claimant also rejects the Respondent's argument that the Tribunal should consider arbitrability *ex officio*.548\n\nClaimant's Comments on *Achmea*, paras. 205-206, *referring to* Swiss Federal Tribunal, Case No. 4A\\_12/2017, Judgment, 19 September 2017, para. 3.2.2.1 **(Ex.

The Tribunal's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nHaving carefully considered the arguments presented by both sides, the Tribunal finds itself in agreement with the Claimant. It holds that the *Achmea* judgment has no impact on this Tribunal's jurisdiction, as the Respondent is foreclosed from raising this objection at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n439.\n\nThe seat of this arbitration is Geneva, Switzerland.549 Importantly, the Tribunal is seated outside the EU.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2 dated 27 February 2015.\n\n440.\n\nIt is well accepted that the seat of arbitration determines the procedural law governing the arbitration, and will likely impose procedural rules by which all parties must comply. Equally, the arbitration law at the seat will dictate the extent to which domestic courts will involve themselves, or may intervene, in the arbitral process, the degree to which an arbitral award may be affirmatively challenged (*i.e.*, set aside or annulled) and the grounds for such a challenge. The Tribunal therefore cannot agree with the Respondent's submission that the seat of arbitration is irrelevant to the Tribunal's analysis.550 On the contrary, the Tribunal is called upon to satisfy itself that all Parties to this arbitration have complied with all relevant legal requirements at the seat of the arbitration throughout the arbitral process, and that there is no issue with respect of its jurisdiction as far as its seat is concerned.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 83.\n\n441.\n\nIt is for this reason that the Tribunal deems it appropriate to consider both the conduct of the Respondent in raising its jurisdictional objection based upon the *Achmea* judgment, and the impact of the *Achmea* judgment itself on the Tribunal's jurisdiction from the perspective of Swiss law and the likely approach of the Swiss courts.\n\n442.\n\nUnder the applicable Swiss procedural law, objections to an arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction must be brought in a timely manner. Article 186(2) of the PILA, codifying the principle of foreclosure, specifies that \"[a]ny objection to [the Tribunal's] jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defense on the merits.\" This provision does not spell out the consequences of a failure to contest jurisdiction before dealing with the merits, but it is generally accepted that where a respondent enters an unconditional appearance and makes submissions on the merits, such behaviour constitutes an irrevocable waiver of its right to contest the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction.551\n\nBerger/Kellerhals, para. 638 **(Ex. CLA-253)**; SFT, Case No. 120 II 155, Judgment, 19 April 1994, para. 3b)bb) **(Ex. CLA-292)**; SFT, Case No. 128 III 50, Judgment, 16 October 2001, para. 2c)aa) **(Ex. CLA-293)**.\n\n443.\n\nSimilarly, Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence or, with respect to a counter-claim, in the reply to the counter-claim.\"\n\n444.\n\nIn this case, there is nothing to which the Respondent can point to satisfy the requirement in both Article 186(2) of the PILA and Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules that the jurisdictional objection in question was raised no later than the statement of defence, or any defence on the merits. Rather, as detailed below, the Respondent specifically and repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings that it would not object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis of the intra-EU nature of the dispute.\n\n445.\n\nIn the Response to the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent noted that \"the Czech Republic does not raise (or intend to raise) the intra-European Union BIT objection\".552\n\nResponse, para. 228.\n\n446.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent stated that \"the Czech Republic does not plead a fundamental incompatibility between investment treaties and EU law\".553\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 296, 363.\n\n447.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent submitted that the \"Czech Republic, as you know, does not advance an intra-EU jurisdictional objection in this case\".554\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 188:9-10 and the Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide No. 67.\n\n448.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent's contention that any waiver of rights under Article 186(2) of the PILA, to be effective, must be expressed in \"clear and unequivocal\" terms.555 In this regard, the Respondent has drawn the Tribunal's attention to what it considers to be qualifying language in its submissions that would make any alleged waiver neither clear nor unequivocal. For instance, in its Counter-Memorial the Respondent noted that \"'the intra-EU objection raise[d] many complex and serious jurisdictional issues', which are more appropriately resolved by the ECJ\".556\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 164.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 165, Counter-Memorial, paras. 368-369.\n\n449.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed each of these statements, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent. In the Tribunal's view, none of the Respondent's referenced qualifications changes the nature of its representations, and indeed undertakings, repeated at different stages throughout these proceedings, that no jurisdictional objection would be raised with respect to the intra-EU issue (*i.e.*, the same issue that has now been decided in *Achmea*). In all the circumstances, the Tribunal therefore concludes that the Respondent waived any intra-EU jurisdictional objection. Had the Respondent intended to reserve its rights, it could have done so by including express language to this effect. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent's waiver was \"clear and unequivocal\" and therefore valid under Article 186(2) of the PILA.\n\n450.\n\nThere is then the question whether there is anything about the nature of the *Achmea* judgment and the principle for which it stands that changes this analysis as a matter of Swiss law.\n\n451.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Article 186(2) of the PILA \"only applies to objectively arbitrable matters\" and the *Achmea* judgment as an \"expression of EU mandatory provisions\" renders any intra-EU dispute, including the present one, objectively non-arbitrable. In other words, the mandatory nature of the rule of EU law identified in the *Achmea* judgment is such that the Respondent is free to raise an objection based upon this rule in Swiss arbitral proceedings at any stage, whether before, during or after defending on the merits, and without regard to the Swiss rules on waiver.\n\n452.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree. As both Parties have submitted, EU law is considered by Switzerland as public international law between third countries (\"*res inter alios acta*\").557 Pursuant to Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution, the Swiss Confederation and the Cantons shall respect international law that is binding upon them. Similarly, Article 190 of the Swiss Constitution provides that the Swiss Supreme Court and other judicial authorities are bound to apply international law. These references to international law comprise only those norms of international law that are binding upon Switzerland. This includes, for example, customary international law, the general principles of law and the treaties signed and ratified by Switzerland. However, since Switzerland is not an EU Member State, nor a member of the European Economic Area, it cannot be said that EU law strictly forms part of international law within the meaning of the Swiss Constitution, or enjoys a special status or primacy over other rules of international law. The Tribunal is unpersuaded by the Respondent's arguments that the policy of Swiss courts to interpret Swiss statutes in harmony with EU law or the extensive network of treaties between Switzerland and the EU have a bearing on the status of EU law within the Swiss legal order. While these developments may be evidence of a growing economic integration between Switzerland and the EU, they cannot, in and of themselves, fundamentally change the legal character of EU law in Switzerland, or indeed the fact that Swiss courts are under no obligation to follow the ECJ's jurisprudence.558 The Tribunal therefore concludes that EU law does not enjoy primacy in Switzerland. Accordingly, the question of objective arbitrability must be determined from the perspective of Swiss law.\n\n*See* Respondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 144; Claimant's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 129.\n\n*See e.g.* SFT, Case No. 124 II 193, Judgment, 19 March 1998, para. 6a **(Ex. CLA-251)**; SFT, Case No. 124 III 495 Judgment, 13 November 1998, para. 2a **(Ex. CLA-252)**.\n\n453.\n\nThe applicable Article 177(1) of the PILA provides that \"[a]ny dispute of financial interest may be the subject of an arbitration\". This is a self-sufficient substantive provision of Swiss international arbitration law, as opposed to a conflict of laws rule.559 As such, the Tribunal must only apply this rule, to the exclusion of any potentially stricter foreign rules (even if closely connected to the dispute). The Tribunal notes, in this regard, the *Fincantieri* judgment, in which the Swiss Federal Tribunal upheld a partial award on jurisdiction, finding that the commercial embargo imposed by the United Nations against Iraq did not affect the arbitrability under Swiss law of a dispute involving an agency agreement for the conclusion of contracts with the Republic of Iraq, and that the fact that an award rendered in Switzerland might not be enforceable in other jurisdictions pursuant to Article V(2) of the New York Convention was not a relevant factor for the purposes of Article 177(1) PILA.560\n\nBerger/Kellerhals, para. 217 **(Ex. CLA-253)**.\n\nSFT, Case No 118 II 353, Judgment, 23 June 1992 **(Ex. CLA 254)**.\n\n454.\n\nIt bears mention here that there is a consensus amongst commentators on Swiss law that foreign law has no bearing on arbitrability in Switzerland, even if it is considered part of the public policy of the foreign system at issue \u2013 unless it is also part of Swiss international public policy within the (restrictive) meaning of Article 190(2)(e) PILA.561 But the Tribunal has seen nothing to justify a conclusion that the principle identified in the *Achmea* judgment constitutes Swiss international public policy (as this notion has been defined). On the contrary, as the Claimant has noted, Switzerland has signed and ratified numerous BITs with different States, including EU Member States, providing for investor-State arbitration, and has manifested a clear pro-arbitration policy.\n\nBerger/Kellerhals, para. 272-274 **(Ex. CLA-253)**; J.F. Poudret, S. Besson, *Comparative law of international arbitration*, 2nd ed., Sweet & Maxwell, 2007, para. 333 **(Ex. CLA-255)**.\n\n455.\n\nIn so far as the Respondent relies on the decision in *Eco Swiss*,562 the Tribunal considers this of no assistance. This decision concerned the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, whereas the *Achmea* judgment (as the Respondent itself has asserted) raises an issue of objective arbitrability, which in this case \u2013 unlike in *Eco Swiss* \u2013is governed exclusively by Article 177(1) of the PILA.\n\nRespondent's Comments on *Achmea*, para. 150, *referring to Eco Swiss China Time Ltd v. Benetton International NV,* ECJ Judgment, Case C-126/97, 1 June 1999 (**Ex. RLA-50**); Swiss Federal Tribunal, Case No. 4P.278/2005, BGE 132 III 389, Judgment, 8 March 2008 **(Ex. RLA-395)**.\n\n456.\n\nIt follows that applying Article 177(1) of the PILA, the present dispute, which clearly involves financial interests, is objectively arbitrable under Swiss law. Whether the dispute is also arbitrable under EU law need not be decided by this Tribunal. More specifically, whether the award is enforceable outside Switzerland, or within the EU, has no impact on objective arbitrability within Switzerland.\n\n457.\n\nIt also follows that the *Achmea* judgment and the principle of EU law for which it stands cannot have the effect of ignoring the procedural rules applicable to this Swiss arbitration.\n\n458.\n\nFurther, Article 177(2) of the PILA precludes a State, which is a party to an arbitration agreement, from invoking its own law in order to contest the arbitrability of a dispute covered by such an arbitration agreement. It applies squarely to the present arbitration. To the extent that the Respondent argues that Article 177(2) of the PILA is not applicable in the present circumstances as the *Achmea* judgment is not attributable to the Respondent, the Tribunal disagrees. EU law, including the obligation to comply with judgments from the ECJ, forms part of the domestic legal system of the Czech Republic.563\n\nThe same conclusion flows from the application of Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT.\n\n459.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary or appropriate to pronounce itself on the application of the *Achmea* judgment to an arbitration brought under the ECT.\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the *Achmea* judgment cannot be relied upon by the Respondent. It has no impact on this Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**VI. MERITS**\n--------------\n\n**A. WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT STANDARD**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Whether the Respondent Failed to Provide a Stable Legal Framework**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n461.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent violated its obligation to accord the Claimant and its investment fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") under the ECT by changing the legal framework applicable to investments in the photovoltaic power plant market.564 In the present case, the Claimant submits that the obligation to provide FET is contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT.565\n\nMemorial, paras. 331, 332, 335.\n\nMemorial, paras. 356-358.\n\n462.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security [\u2026].566\n\nMemorial, para. 336.\n\n463.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, FET is a flexible standard, breaches of which may be established by reference to several types of host States' conducts, which may partially overlap.567 Such conduct includes (1) the failure to provide a stable and predictable investment framework; and (2) the failure to protect a foreign investor's legitimate expectations; and (3) the failure to act in a reasonable manner.568\n\nMemorial, para. 346.\n\nMemorial, paras. 347, *referring to* Dolzer/Schreuer, p. 133 **(Ex. CLA-29)**. *See also* Reply, paras. 625-628.\n\n464.\n\nFirst, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to provide a stable and predictable investment framework by introducing the Solar Levy, removing the Income Tax Exemption, and changing the Shortened Depreciation Period.569\n\nMemorial, para. 384; Reply, paras. 676-678.\n\n465.\n\nFor the Claimant, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework may be distinguished from the obligation to protect an investor's legitimate expectations.570 The former enshrines a host State's general obligation not to change its investment framework retroactively to the detriment of a foreign investor, while the latter requires an examination of an individual investors' expectations. Accordingly, the Tribunal may determine that the host State violated the obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework \"without a specific consideration of the individual investors' expectations.\"571 Accordingly, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework should be examined from an objective perspective, regardless of whether a host State has provided a specific assurance or whether an investor has acknowledged such a specific assurance.572\n\nReply, para. 627.\n\nReply, paras. 629-631, *see also* Memorial, para. 310-327, *Duke Energy v.

C-203)**; EC Proposal of 31 May 2000 for a directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market **(Ex. C-206)**; 2001 Directive **(Ex. C-20)**; EC Communication of 7 December 2005, *The support of electricity from renewable energy sources* **(Ex. C-207)**; 2009 Directive, **(Ex. C-23)**.\n\n468.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that the object and purpose of the ECT is (a) to promote investments between the Contracting States, for example, by providing a long-term incentive regime, and (b) to require host States to protect investors from legislative changes for a reasonable period of time.578\n\nMemorial, para. 382; Reply, para. 675.\n\n469.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant refers to Article 10(1) of the ECT which expressly requires host States to \"encourage and create stable [\u2026] conditions for investors.\"579 The Claimant emphasises that this provision should be interpreted in accordance with the object and purpose of the ECT as set out in its introductory note, namely strengthening \"the rule of law\" on energy matters which, according to the Claimant, strictly prohibits retroactive regime changes.580\n\nMemorial, para. 379, *observing inter alia* that the ECT's aim to ensure regulatory stability is confirmed by the context and circumstances of its conclusion, which are relevant under the VCLT rules on treaty interpretation. *See also* Reply, para. 673.\n\nReply, para. 674.\n\n470.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that a stabilization clause would be necessary to stabilize the Incentive Regime.581\n\nReply. paras. 635, 641, 642.\n\n471.\n\nFirst, the Claimant points out that the Respondent acknowledges that the Act on Promotion provided a promise of stabilization when it stated that investors were entitled to expect the 15-year simple payback and the 7% return under the Act, even if the Act does not entail any specific stabilization clause.582\n\nReply, paras. 644-646.\n\n472.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that an express contractual stabilization clause is not necessary to prohibit a host State from changing its investment scheme, considering that, in the RES market, direct contracts with the Government are unusual, as RES producers typically are small businesses and the RES electricity produced is sold directly to the network operators.583 Accordingly, in the Claimant's view, it is unreasonable to require a specific contractual clause to impose an obligation on the host State to stabilize its investment regime.584 In this regard, the Claimant notes that its position is in line with relevant regulatory practice in the RES market, according to which agencies usually do not review an incentive mechanism once it is set.585\n\nReply, paras. 647-653, 661, *referring to AES*, para. 9.3.30 **(Ex. RLA-41)**; *Fair and Equitable Treatment*, UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II, 2012, p. 69 **(Ex. CLA-128)**; and *Micula*, para. 529 **(Ex.

Spiller and Anton Garcia, dated 28 March 2016, para. 3.23, 3.25, 3.27, 4.17-19.\n\n473.\n\nTo support this argument, the Claimant refers to an ERO report which provides that the Act on Promotion was \"bringing a guarantee of long-term and stable promotion necessary for decision-making by businesses\", without mentioning contractual stabilization clauses.586 The Claimant rejects the position advanced by Professor Cameron that it would not be recommendable for investors to enter foreign markets without an express stabilization commitment, since this analysis allegedly failed to consider the RES market's specific background.587 Additionally, the Claimant notes that, even if the Respondent unintentionally promised stabilization without a contractual negotiation, it should not be able to rely on its own misunderstanding.588\n\nReply, para. 657, *referrring to* Report on the Fulfilment of the Indicative Target for Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources for 2008, Ministry of Industry and Trade, 1 November 2009, p. 22, para. 5.1 **(Ex.

Bhd. And MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*,590*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*,591 and *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

Argentine Republic*,594*Enron*,595 and *Eureko v. Republic of Poland*,596 decided that the requirement of stability is fundamental to the FET standard.597 Finally, the Claimant contends that the tribunal in *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*598 found that a mere change of a host State's investment policy can constitute a breach of the FET standard.599\n\n*Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.

Argentine Republic*, *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania*, and *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania*,607 the Respondent argues that an investment treaty does not, as a general matter, limit a State's discretion to change or modify its national legislation unless the treaty contains a specific stabilization provision or other specific mechanisms to this effect.608 In the Respondent's view, this is particularly true in the energy sector where regulators often intervene to address market failures such as, for example, monopolies or the abuse of market power.609 According to the Respondent, this view is shared by certain Middle and South American countries, which enacted legislation that provides for the possibility of contractual stabilization clauses.610 The Respondent argues that such express stabilization arrangements must clearly stipulate that existing laws \"continue to apply to the beneficiary even in the face of legislative or regulatory change, and/or identification of a remedy in the event the beneficiary is subjected to adverse changes\".611 The Respondent further submits that the tribunals in *Duke Energy v. Peru*,612*Noble Energy*,613*Oxus v. The Republic of Uzbekistan,*614*Occidental*615 and *Nations Energy Inc. and others v. The Republic of Panama*,616 required evidence of specific and express arrangements to protect investors from legislative changes in order to establish a treaty violation.617\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 454; Rejoinder, paras. 509, 523.\n\nRejoinder, para. 515, *referring to* *Philip Morris Brands S\u00c1RL, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v.

To the extent that the Explanatory Report mentions that the Act purported to achieve a \"stable promotion\", the Respondent argues that the simple use of the term \"stable\" or \"maintain\" is not sufficient to conclude that stabilization was intended.621 The language only meant to indicate that the tax relief would continue even after the complete opening of the electricity market. In contrast, the wording did not intend to stabilize the legislation.622 The Respondent also notes that since the Explanatory Report was neither a law, regulation, nor decree, these wordings are not binding upon the Czech Republic in any event.623 Similarly, the wording \"[the Act on Promotion] [\u2026] bring[s] a guarantee of long-term and stable promotion\" in the ERO report of 2009 was not sufficient to stabilize legislation.624\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 461; Rejoinder, paras. 510-511, *referring to Total* Decision on Liability, para. 115 **(Ex.

However, the conditions for such a legislative stabilization are not fulfilled in the present case.625\n\nRejoinder, para. 546.\n\n483.\n\nFinally, in response to the Claimant's allegation that the Respondent admits that the Incentive Regime provided a promise of stabilization, the Respondent agrees that the Incentive Regime was designed to provide a 15-year simple payback and a 7% return, but maintains that no further, or other, promise was given.626\n\nRejoinder, paras. 521-523.\n\n**2.

CLA-3)**.\n\n488.\n\nIn relation to the first step, the Claimant argues that the decisive question is \"whether [a host State] acted in a manner that would reasonably be understood to create such an appearance\".643 Conversely, the host State's actual intent is said to be irrelevant.644 However, the Claimant agrees with the Respondent's view that, objectively considered, an investor's expectations must have been objectively legitimately formed at the time of the investment and that minor expectations are not protected.645 The latter restriction is immaterial in the present circumstances, however, since according to the Claimant its expectations as to the stability of the Investment Scheme were fundamental to its investment decision and therefore not minor.646\n\nReply, para. 687, *referring to Micula*, para. 669 **(Ex.

CLA-29)**; *Electrabel* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 7.79 **(Ex. RLA-39)**.\n\n490.\n\nWith respect to the first limb of the above test, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent made the following promises of regulatory stability: (1) the FiT level would be stable for 20 years pursuant to Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion, and the relevant ERO regulations; (2) the Income Tax Exemption would continue to apply for six years, pursuant to Section 19(1)(d) of the Act on Income Tax; and (3) the Shortened Depreciation Period, ranging between five to ten years, would be available, pursuant to Section 30 of the Act on Income Tax.648\n\nMemorial, para. 401.\n\n491.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the promised legislative stability as detailed above stems from (1) the legislation which established the Incentive Regime; (2) the very purpose of the Incentive Regime itself; (3) the Respondent's promotional activities surrounding the Incentive Regime, and (4) the particularities of the licensing process to operate the Claimant's plants.649\n\nMemorial, para. 395; Reply, para. 690.\n\n492.\n\nFirst, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent's promise of stability is apparent, since the Incentive Regime contained clear rules through the Act on Promotion, the 2007 Technical Regulation, the 2009 Pricing Regulation, and the Act on Income Tax.650 With regard to the Act on Promotion, the Claimant notes that Article 6(1)(b)(2), and the relevant provisions under the Technical Regulation and the Pricing Regulation, established that the FiT would be payable for 20 years.651 According to the Claimant, the promised stability was not limited to a 15-year simple payback and a 7% return rate.652 In this regard, the Claimant objects to the Respondent's argument that Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, which allows investors to recover investment costs within 15 years, supersedes Article 6(1)(b)(2), arguing that Article 6(1)(b)(1) is only meant to specify the criteria for establishing the FiT level.653 The irrelevance of the return rate in setting FiT is supported by the fact that the ERO did not review the return rates annually.654 The Claimant emphasizes that Mr. Jones, the Respondent's industry expert, agreed at the hearing that the 15-year simple payback would not have attracted investments in the Czech RES market.655 Similarly, the WACC, as set by the ERO at 7%, was not sufficient to achieve the 8% EU target for 2010.656 In addition, the Claimant submits that a WACC was no more than an indicative technical parameter to calculate FiT under the Technical Regulation.657 Moreover, the Respondent's argument ignores the importance of stability from a business perspectives.658\n\nMemorial, para. 394; Reply, para. 692, *referring to* First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, para. 27, 33.\n\nMemorial, para. 401.\n\nReply, paras. 693-695.\n\nMemorial, para. 402.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 68:20-69:5.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 25:13-25, *referring to* Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 112:1-5.\n\nHearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 18:17-19:7.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 May 2017), 23:20-22; *referring to* ERO Regulation No. 364/2007 Coll. **(Ex.

The Kingdom of Spain*,663 which found that the claimants, who were Spanish RES investors, could not rely on legitimate expectations, may be distinguished from the case at hand because in *Charanne* the alleged guaranteed period amounted to 30-50 years, and therefore was unreasonably longer than in the case at hand.664\n\n*Charanne B.V., Construction Investments S.A.R.L. v.

C-118)**.\n\n497.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the decision of the Tribunal in *PSEG*,672 which held that the legislative purpose of a State measure in that case was insufficient to support the argument that the host State's government actively attracted foreign investments, may be distinguished from the present case, as the purpose of the Incentive Regime is sufficiently clear.673\n\n*PSEG*, para. 243 **(Ex. CLA-33)**.\n\nReply, para. 710.\n\n498.\n\nContrary to what the Respondent alleges, the Claimant argues that the Explanatory Report constitutes a sufficient basis for legitimate expectations.674 Although the report is not a source of law, it is evidence of the Czech Republic's intention to attract photovoltaic investors.675 The Claimant further argues that the fact that the Explanatory Report does not mention the Shortened Depreciation Period is due to the fact that the Act on Income Tax already provided a clear promise of stability in the period.676 That the Explanatory Report does not address the Claimant individually is also irrelevant, because individual knowledge is not necessary for legitimate expectations to arise.677 Moreover, the Claimant alleges that it had actual knowledge of the 2010 Action Plan, which mentioned that financial support was available to RES investments.678\n\nReply, para. 712.\n\nReply, para. 712.\n\nReply, para. 712.\n\nReply, para. 713.\n\nReply, para. 713.\n\n499.\n\nThird, the Claimant argues that the Czech Government and the ERO officials launched an intense marketing campaign to promote the FiT offered under the Act on Promotion, submitting several examples of this campaign.679\n\nMemorial, para. 407; Reply, para. 714.\n\n500.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, its representative attended a number of conferences in which the Czech Republic's officials explained that the FiT would be stable for 20 years for plants commissioned by the end of 2010.680 In response to the Respondent's argument that these presentations were to highlight the possibility of retroactive changes, the Claimant submits that such an argument is at odds with the text of the presentation slide. In addition, the official did not mention the possibility of a retroactive regime change.681\n\nMemorial, para. 408, *referring to* First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, para. 34.\n\nMemorial, para. 396, Reply, paras. 360, 715, *referring to* \"Legislative Environment and Promotion of the Electricity Produced from Photovoltaic Power Plants 2009\", ERO Presentation, 15 October 2009, slide No. 15-16, 20, and 4 (**Ex. R-156**); Second Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, para. 16-17.\n\n501.\n\nIn support of its argument that the Respondent intended to attract foreign investors, the Claimant submits that the \"Q&A tool\" was translated, and published specifically for foreign investors.682 With respect to the \"Q&A tool\", the Claimant notes that it explained that the FiT would apply for 20 years.683 Moreover, the Claimant submits that the 2010 Action Plan did not provide for a cap on the total volume of electricity for the FiT, and that the plan forecasted a significant rise of photovoltaic installations for the year 2010.684\n\nMemorial para. 397; Reply, para. 714, *referring to* Q&A from ERO website available in 2009 (**Ex.

Italy) judgment and the *TECO* decision, a domestic court decision does not shield a host State from international liability arising out of a treaty provision.690 In addition, the decision is distinguishable from the case at hand, because the Czech Constitutional Court employed the domestic standard of legitimate expectations, under which the court focussed on the Solar Levy's impacts on the investor's property right, instead of on a promise provided for by the Czech Republic.691 The Claimant also notes that the Constitutional Court's loyalty to the State might have affected its decision.692\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 73:17-78:20.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 73:17-74:16, *referring to* May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment **(Ex.

In particular, the Tribunal should analyse (1) whether the Claimant had legitimate expectations; (2) whether the Claimant reasonably relied on those legitimate expectations; and (3) whether the violation amounts to a breach of the investment treaties.693 In relation to the last element, the Respondent states that minor expectations do not trigger a treaty violation.694 Additionally, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal should analyse the relevant circumstances objectively, and it should ensure that any expectations were formed at the time of investment.695 In respect of the threshold question whether legitimate expectations objectively existed, the Respondent refers to a four-step test:696 First, the host State must have given a clear and unequivocal assurance.697 Second, the State's assurance must apply to individual investors.698 Third, the investor must have relied on the State's assurance.699 Fourth, the investor's reliance must have been reasonable.700\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 462, *referring to* *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. and Murphy Oil Corporation v.

This is especially true in the energy sector, where regulatory changes are frequent.702 Further, the Respondent alleges that legitimate expectations can only derive from specific legislative provisions.703 Since the Claimant does not refer to any specific provisions of the Act on Income Tax on which it allegedly relied in making its investment decision, no legitimate expectations could arise in the first place.704\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 468, *referring to* *Duke Energy v.

In that case, the tribunal found that while the explanatory report contained specific language that the expected legislative changes would not affect existing investors, this still did not constitute sufficient evidence to support the claimants' argument that stabilization was intended.729 The Respondent also finds support for its position in the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, in which the court concluded that the introduction of the Solar Levy and withdrawal of the Tax incentives did not constitute a violation of investors' legitimate expectations.730\n\n*Charanne*, para. 496 **(Ex.

The Ministry of the Environment expressly discussed the enactment of the Solar Levy in July 2010, with the Ministry of Finance becoming involved in September 2010.735 As to the Shortened Depreciation Period, the Respondent alleges that it is unreasonable to expect that it would be stable only in relation to solar power plants, since it did not constitute photovoltaic specific legislation.736 In addition, the Respondent submits that the Czech Technical University, in its study for ERO of 2007, already expected that the Income Tax Provisions would be modified.737\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 478-482.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 496-501\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 496, 501.\n\nCounter-Mermorial, para. 497.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 500\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 148:10-16.\n\n513.\n\nIn the face of the influx of investors, the Czech caretaker government stated that measures would be put in train after the elected government took office \u2013 which was done.

Argentina* recognized the relevance of widespread expectations, as it was unlikely that several professionals make the same mistake at the same time.767 In particular, not only investors, but also Czech banks believed that the FiT level would be stable.768 The Claimant further points out that the Respondent itself believed in such stability, since it gave licenses to energy experts, which conducted \"energy audits\" for banks in advance of their approval of investments.769 Moreover, the Claimant notes that the Czech banks and auditors also understood that the FiT level would apply to plants commissioned by the end of 2010 without considering the 15-year simple payback and the 7% rate of return.770 In this regard, the Claimant submits that the \u010cEZ, a State-owned entity, also significantly invested in the photovoltaic market in 2009 and 2010.771\n\nReply, para. 738, 744.\n\nReply, para.739 *referring to* *CMS*, para. 137 **(Ex.

Those proceedings had been instituted based upon a suspected abuse of power arising out of the ERO's extension of the life period of photovoltaic facilities from 15 to 20 years, and its failure to alter the parameters for 2009.778 The fact that the \u010cEZ, a State-owned entity, significantly invested in the photovoltaic market in 2009 and 2010 also supports the assumption that a revocation of the incentive regime was not expected.779\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 29:10-17.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 30:21-31:9.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 77:16-19.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 77:16-78:3.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 78:4-9.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 22:4-20.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant's reliance on any alleged promises was unreasonable for a number of reasons.780\n\nRejoinder, para. 544.\n\n528.\n\nFirst, in its analysis of the reasonableness of the investor's reliance, so argues the Respondent, the Tribunal should also take account of social and economic circumstances. The Respondent alleges that the Claimant entered into the market, notwithstanding that it knew, or should have known, that the RES Scheme was financially not sustainable for the year 2010.781 In fact, since July 2009, the ERO and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, in their consultations, presentations and press releases, had warned of possible changes to the Act on Promotion. They considered the 7% WACC was an original target under the Act on Promotion.782 Moreover, the Respondent submits that on 24 August 2009, before the Claimant made its investment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a press release that it was planning to amend the Act on Promotion.783 In addition, several other sources at the time of the solar \"bubble\" indicated that a regime change might be in the offing.784 As evidence of this, the Czech Technical University, in its study for ERO of 2007, already expected that the Income Tax Provisions would be modified.785\n\nRejoinder, paras. 546, 549, 551, 552.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017) 148:20-155:22, *referring to* Minutes of the meeting regarding the proposal of the changes in technical economic parameters of small hydroelectric power plants and photovoltaic power plants for 2010, ERO, 14 July 2009 **(Ex.

As evidence for this, the Respondent points out that Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd, a shareholder and board member of SolarOne, recognized the possibility of legislative changes in the feasibility study prepared for the Claimant in October 2008.786 Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd also acknowledged that media sources used the term \"solar boom\" and that legislation might be amended so as to react to the growth of the photovoltaic market.787 The Respondent argues that if tariffs are too beneficial, as in the present case, reasonable investors should expect so called-retroactive changes.788\n\nRejoinder, para. 546, *referring to* Second Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, para.19.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 131:24-132:5; Respondent's Closing Statement Slides, 97-99.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 124:24-125:7.\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the tribunals in *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v. The Republic of Hungary*789 and *Electrabel v. Hungary*790 concluded that Hungary's re-introduction of administrative pricing for electricity generators was permissible.791 In the Respondent's view, these cases provide useful context in the present case, because the challenged State measure was also meant to reduce excessive profits to the originally intended level.792 In response to the Claimant's argument that these cases are distinguishable from the case at hand, because the termination of the administrative pricing was predictable, the Respondent alleges that the issue in those cases was not the termination, but the re-imposition of the administrative pricing.793\n\n*AES*, paras. 10.3.20, 10.3.31, 10.3.44 **(Ex.

With regard to the Slune\u010dni plant, the Respondent observes that this connection actually was made after the amendment measures became known.795\n\nRejoinder, para. 555, *referring to* *Ulysseas*, *Inc. v.

With respect to *Toto Costruzioni*,808 which held that the FET standard does not entail a guarantee of stability of a tax law regime, the Claimant alleges that the case dealt with the specific circumstance in Lebanon.809 With respect to *AES* and *Electrabel*, which found that Hungary's change in its investment scheme was lawful under the ECT, the Claimant argues that investors in those cases were able to forecast Hungary's repeal of the administrative price regime.810 In addition, the relevant legislation contained the language \"profit necessary for ongoing operation\", which is more restrictive than the language \"revenue\" used in the Act on Promotion.811 Further, the increase in the return rate that investors in the *Electrabel v. Hungary* case received (from 10.7% in 1997 to 39% in 2005) significantly differs from the increase in the case at hand.812\n\n*Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v.

RLA-39)**.\n\n539.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that a memorandum in 2009 notified the Claimant that the Respondent's measures would impact on its project's \"profitability\", the Claimant argues that the memorandum did not mention that the measures would affect existing investors.813\n\nReply, para. 751.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the legitimate expectations as to the stability of the Incentive Regime the Claimant may have had, were not violated by the Respondent.\n\n541.\n\nWith regard to the Solar Levy, the Respondent first alleges that it did not change the level of the FiT, because the levy did not reduce either the FiT price set in the ERO price regulations or the total revenue from the FiT; it only affected after-tax profits.814 Accordingly, in the Respondent's view, the Solar Levy is consistent with Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion, which allegedly provides, together with the relevant ERO regulations, that the FiT will remain stable for 20 years.815 In addition, the Respondent states that even if there was a violation of Article 6(1)(b)(2), this would only amount to a breach of local law, which does not rise to the level of a violation of FET, FPS, or Non-Impairment standards.816\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 470; Rejoinder, paras. 508, 525-528.\n\nRejoinder, para. 528.\n\nRejoinder, para. 529.\n\n542.\n\nReferring to *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. The Republic of Lebanon*,817 the Respondent submits that a host State violates the FET obligation only if it makes a \"drastic or discriminatory change in the essential features of the transaction.\"818 In the present case, however, there was no such radical change.819 In fact, the amendment measures only decreased overall returns for plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010 by 1.4% (8.4% to 7%) and 3% (11.4% to 8.4%) respectively.820 In the Respondent's view, the Act on Promotion was meant to provide for a 7% lifetime return and a 15-year payback and the implementation measures did not repeal these. The Act on Promotion did not contain a promise of good \"profitability\" of investments.821 In fact, a memorandum by Worthald Partners (of which Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd, one of the shareholders of SolarOne, was CEO) presented in the summer of 2009 acknowledged that the investment's \"profitability\" was not guaranteed and that it might be threatened by legislative changes during the planned project period.822 In support of this position, the Respondent also relies on the award in *AES*823 and the decision in *Electrabel*,824 which concluded that Hungary's reduction of profits to the originally purposed level, covering costs and reasonable return only, was permissible under the ECT.825\n\n*Toto Costruzioni*, para. 242 **(Ex.

C-18** / **R-1)**.\n\n545.\n\nIn March 2005, the Respondent adopted the Act on Promotion, with the legislative objective of promoting renewable energy sources and which, important for present purposes, introduced the FiT. The FiT system obliged grid operators to purchase all electricity produced from RES on a priority basis at a price annually determined by the ERO \u2013 the Czech Energy Regulatory Office \u2013 pursuant to Article 6 of the Act on Promotion, which has been set out earlier in this Award.827\n\n*See above* paras. 140, 144.\n\n546.\n\nIt is important to note that the Act on Promotion does not contain all details of the Incentive Regime. Article 6(1) provides that the ERO will define the FiT for solar electricity one calendar year in advance. Article 6(1)(a) specifies that the FiT must be set so as to allow the Respondent to meet the 8% Indicative 2010 Target and Article 6(1)(b)(1) provides that the FiT must be such that the investment in certain PV plants can be paid back within 15 years.\n\n547.\n\nBy the Technical Regulation dated 30 November 2005 and amended in 2007 and 2009, the ERO set out the general technical and economic parameters in order for newly installed plants to achieve the 15-year payback period provided by Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion.828 Again as set out earlier in this Award, section 4 of the Technical Regulation stated that:\n\n**In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured** through the support by Purchase Prices [*FiT*] of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and economic parameters of an installation producing electricity from renewable sources must be satisfied, where the producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve, with the given level of Purchasing Prices\n\nb) **an adequate return** on invested capital during the total life of the installation, such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and\n\nc) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero.829 (emphasis added)\n\nERO Regulation No. 475/2005 Coll. **(Ex. C-28)**; ERO Regulation No. 364/2007 Coll. **(Ex. C-29)**; ERO Regulation No. 409/2009 Coll. **(Ex. C-30)**; Technical Regulation **(Ex. R-6)**; Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 22:18-22.\n\nTechnical Regulation **(Ex. R-6)**.\n\n548.\n\nThe Technical Regulation thus confirmed that the FiT was fixed to obtain a 15-year payback regime with an adequate return on the investment during its lifetime as determined by the WACC. The after-tax WACC in turn was set by the ERO at 7%. In other words, the Act on Promotion guaranteed a FiT that led to a 15-year payback of the investment costs with WACC (or a profit) of 7% per year over 15 years. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that these were the Act on Promotion's primary targets.\n\n549.\n\nThis conclusion is not altered by the fact that Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion stipulated that the \"amount of the revenues stays unchanged for the unit of the electricity from renewable sources with the support of the buy-out prices for the period of 15 years since the year, when the device was put into operation as minimum amount\". The Tribunal is of the opinion that one cannot read the first part of that provision in isolation from the remainder of the clause. Notably, Article 6(1)(b)(2) makes reference to the FiT, or \"buy-out prices\", previously mentioned in Article 6(1)(b)(1) and provides that the FiT is to \"support\" the \"amount of the revenues\" generated by renewable sources. Article 6(1)(b) refers to the FiT and buy-out prices. It does not provide an abstract guarantee of revenues, but makes those revenues dependent on the buy-out prices. Moreover, it indicates that the buy-out prices had to be established following the criteria contained in the Technical Regulation. The promised revenue is therefore necessarily linked to the FiT. The FiT in turn was set by the ERO, pursuant to the Technical Regulation and, as explained above, it guaranteed a 15-year payback with a 7% WACC. No other independent revenue was promised to investors.\n\n550.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the same conclusion was reached by the Czech Constitutional Court in its May 2012 decision.830\n\nMay 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 68 **(Ex. CLA-12/R-110)**.\n\n551.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers that the modalities of the Incentive Regime were not set in stone. On the contrary, the implementation of the Act on Promotion through the Technical Regulations was amended in the course of time. This was confirmed by the Explanatory Note to the 2007 ERO regulation which stated that the economic and technical parameters would have to change over the course of time and would not remain fixed:\n\nGiven the constant development and improvements of the technology using renewable resources on the one hand and the changes in input prices on the other, these technical and economic parameters need to be changed over the course of time.831\n\nExplanatory note to the draft ERO Regulation No. 364/2007 **(Ex. C-83)**.\n\n552.\n\nWhile the 2005 Technical Regulation estimated the useful life of a PV installation at 15 years, the 2007 Technical Regulation extended the latter period to 20 years.832 Through the extension of the life span from 15 to 20 years and the maintenance of the 15-year payback criterion, the 2007 Technical Regulation in fact confirmed the increased profitability of the photovoltaic investments. The ERO further added that a post-tax 7% WACC for 20 years would be a reasonable compensation.833\n\nERO Regulation No. 364/2007 Coll. **(Ex. C-29)**.\n\nMethodology for Determination of Purchasing Prices and Green Bonuses **(Ex. C-218/R-62)**.\n\n553.\n\nAfterwards, the 2009 ERO Regulation introduced a 2% annual increase of the FiT, although the Act on Promotion, Article 6(b)(2), only states that the FiT would be affected by the Index for Industrial Products.\n\n554.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, when the Claimant entered into the PV plant business, the effect of the 5% limitation and the 2% annual increases was to limit the decrease in the FiT to about 9%.834 However, the price of PV panels had decreased by more than 40% in the same time period. This meant that by 2010, the level of compensation attributable to the FiT was some 30% more than had originally been intended and was considered efficient and fair. These conditions naturally attracted many investors, who wanted to invest in PV RES. Because the investments became extremely attractive, the number of PV plants and their capacity increased between 1 January 2008 and 1 October 2009 from 249 / 3.4 MW to 2,900 / 116.72 MW.835 In June 2009, the payback was said to be 6 years instead of 20 years836, and in July 2010 still 8 years instead of 20 years.837\n\nSee ERO Price Decision No. 7/2007, 20 November 2007 (**Ex. R-32**) (FiT for 2008=13,460) and ERO Price Decision No. 5/2009, 23 November 2009 (**Ex. R-34**) (FiT for 2010=12,150).\n\nLetter from electricity companies (\u010cEZ, E.ON and PRE) to the Chamber of Deputies, 12 March 2010, p. 9 **(Ex.

Political action was difficult, because in March 2009, the Czech Government had resigned. On 19 June 2009, a newspaper reported that the authorities wanted to end the solar boom, but noted that the changes would not be introduced in 2009, because of the political situation in the Czech Republic.838 Indeed, the caretaker government had declared that it would leave all controversial matters for the newly elected government, once it took office. Elections were expected before the end of 2009, but had to be postponed until 28-29 May 2010. A new government only assumed office on 13 July 2010.\n\n\"State wants to stop solar power plants boom,\" (e15.cz), 19 June 2009 **(Ex. R-310)**. *See also* Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 150:4-22.\n\n556.\n\nIn the meantime, in early July 2009, the ERO suggested an amendment to the Act on Promotion to cope with the solar boom and indicated that in some parts of the country, connections of PV plants to the grid were effectively refused.839 On 24 August 2009, *i.e.* ten days before the Tomsan investment was made, the Ministry of Industry issued a press release to draw attention to the fact that the subsidy system had become untenable and announced that it would abolish the 5% limitation rule as of 1 January 2010.840\n\nLetter from Mr. Fi\u0159t (Chairman of the ERO) to Mr. To\u0161ovsk\u00fd (Minister of Industry and Trade), 1 July 2009 **(Ex.

In November 2009, the ERO predicted substantial problems with other RES producers, which were disadvantaged, and with consumers, who had to bear ancillary costs. In February 2010, a moratorium was put in place, which precluded future connections to the grid. In March 2010, the PV sector had sent an open letter to the Czech Parliament about the problem.841\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 83:21-84:10.\n\n558.\n\nAfter the investments were made, more signals of imminent and required change were given, but by then the investments had already been made. On 22 July 2010, a newsletter highlighted the problem, indicating that the Government was intent upon \"cut[ting] the absurdly lucrative revenues of the solar barons\" and that the Minister of Finance was considering the withdrawal of the Tax Holiday.842 In a July 2010 Action Plan, the Ministry of Industry and Trade described the regime as it stood, but the Tribunal does not consider that an investor could possibly have relied on this report as a basis for an expectation that the regime would not change in the future, especially when considered jointly with other contemporaneous events.843\n\n\"Commentary: Solar Boom Will Cost Us Dearly. There is Still Time for Changes\" (IDNES.cz), 22 July 2010 **(Ex. R-205)**.\n\nNational Renewable Energy Action Plan, published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, July 2010 **(Ex. C-69)**.\n\n559.\n\nOn 1 January 2011, the following amendments came into force: (1) the abolition of the 5% limitation for FiT reductions for new plants as of 2011; (2) the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives; and (3) the introduction of the Solar Levy. The Tribunal notes that these changes were already foreshadowed before the Claimant made its investments.\n\n560.\n\nThe possibility that the 5% rule would be abolished had been mentioned already in June 2009,844 and in August 2009, this change was announced.845\n\n*See, e.g.,* \"Super income from the sun,\" Ekonom, 1 July 2009, p. 9 (**Ex. R-142)**; \"State wants to stop solar power plants boom\" (e15.cz), 19 June 2009 **(Ex. R-310)**; \"E15:ERO wants to significantly decrease feed-in tariffs for solar energy,\" finance.cz, 19 June 2009 **(Ex. R-311)**.\n\n\"Ministry of Industry and Trade will Equalize the Support of Renewable Energy Sources,\" Ministry of Industry and Trade Press release, 24 August 2009 **(Ex. R-138)**.\n\n561.\n\nAs for the Tax Incentives, the Tribunal notes that the withdrawal is not covered by the ECT because of the exclusion under Article 21 ECT. Besides, the Tribunal considers that they had no structural link to the incentives stemming from the Act on Promotion, which makes no mention of tax exemptions. Only the Explanatory Report drafted two years prior to the Act on Promotion, mentioned tax benefits as part of the Incentive Regime. The Tribunal is of the view that the relevance of the Explanatory Report is negligible, since it does not have the status of legislation and only depicts the general context. Moreover, when the Government campaigned to encourage PV investments, the tax incentives were not mentioned. On the contrary, a 2007 study of the Czech Technical University for ERP expected that the tax regime would be modified. Although it is not established that the Claimant was aware of this study, it is plain that the study reflects the thinking in 2007 about tax incentives and is therefore pertinent in this context. In November 2009, the abolition of the tax incentives was contemplated by the Ministry of Finance. On 23 July 2010, the Minister of Environment stated that he intended to cut the Tax Holiday.846 Thereafter, Act 346/2010 amending the Income Tax Act was introduced, and on 12 November 2010, approved.\n\nP. Novotn\u00fd, \"The Minister of Environment Wants to Tax Solar Power Plants,\" Mlada Fronta Dnes, 23 July 2010 **(Ex. R-206)**.\n\n562.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that the introduction of the Solar Levy occurred after the Claimant made its investments, it observes that the Claimant was already informed by the 2007 ERO regulation that the economic and technical parameters would have to change over the course of time and would not remain fixed.847 Moreover, Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd, one of the board members and shareholders of SolarOne, had already warned SolarOne and the Claimant of the risk of legislative change which would reduce the investment's profitability.848\n\n*See above* para. 551.\n\nMemorandum prepared by Worthald Partners in summer 2009 to secure a senior debt facility, p. 102 (**Annex XII to First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**).\n\n563.\n\nOverall, the Tribunal concludes that it was already clear towards the end of 2009 that the 5% limitation would be abolished. Amendments in the tax regime were foreshadowed as early as 2007. In November 2009, they were under consideration by the Minister of Finance and a decision to implement them was made in July 2010. As of June 2010, there was concrete speculation about the introduction of a Solar Levy. On the basis of this understanding, the Tribunal now turns to the different heads of claim put forward by the Claimant.\n\n**(b) Discussion of the Claims**\n--------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nAs already set out earlier in this Award, the Parties are divided as to whether the Respondent, by implementing the Solar Levy and withdrawing the Tax Incentives, has violated the Claimant's right to FET under Article 10(1) of the ECT:\n\n565.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides, in relevant part:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security [\u2026].\n\n566.\n\nIn essence, again as noted earlier, the Claimant asserts three heads of claim under the FET standard: (1) the Respondent's violation of its obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework; and (2) the Respondent's violation of the Claimant's legitimate expectations. The Tribunal will consider the arguments pertaining to each of the two in turn. In a last step, the Tribunal will examine (3) whether the Respondent's actions were taken in a non-transparent manner in violation of the FET standard.\n\n**(1) Stable and Predictable Legal Framework**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nAs for the alleged violation of the Respondent's obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework as part of the FET standard, as set out in more detail earlier, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to provide such a framework by introducing the Solar Levy, removing the Income Tax Exemption and abolishing the Shortened Depreciation Period.849 In the Claimant's view, the Incentive Regime established by the Act on Promotion, ERO regulations and the Act on Income Tax between them created the Incentive Regime, which the Respondent was precluded from changing before foreign investors could obtain the promised benefits. The Respondent rejects the Claimant's characterization of the Incentive Regime as guaranteeing stability. It maintains that mere changes to the legal framework applicable to the Claimant's investment do not give rise to a breach of the ECT or BIT.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period are excluded from the ambit of ECT pursuant to its Article 21 (*see* para. 309).\n\n568.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already noted, the Act on Promotion provided for a 15-year payback and the maintenance for a period of 15 years of the amount of revenue per unit of RES electricity. The question, however, is whether the introduction of the Solar Levy and the Tax measures were in breach of the Respondent's obligation to provide a stable and predictable framework.\n\n569.\n\nHaving carefully considered all materials before it, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that it did not expressly undertake any agreed stabilization commitment, be it contractual, legislative, individual or otherwise, vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimant's investment.850 Had the Tribunal found that such stabilization commitment existed in the present circumstances, there would obviously have been a solid basis to allege that changes in the law applicable to the foreign investment in question were unlawful. In the absence of such express commitment, however, the Tribunal must now turn to the question whether an obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for foreign investment is, in any event, a separate and distinguishable part of the treaty obligation to accord FET.\n\n*See* paras. 546 to 550.\n\n570.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that such a separate obligation exists as part of the FET standard. While there is a certain overlap between the two, this obligation is legally distinct from the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations. This is apparent from the wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT, according to which \"[e]ach Contracting Party [\u2026] shall create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors\". Investment tribunals have consistently decided, and this Tribunal agrees, that the obligation to guarantee a stable and predictable investment framework forms part of the FET standard. Compelling reasons to deviate from this established jurisprudence have not been put forward by the Respondent.\n\n571.\n\nThe obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework is to be considered objectively. It is a general obligation of host countries under investment treaties and does not require the demonstration of any reliance on the host State's conduct on the part of the foreign investor. This said, the Tribunal finds itself in agreement with the line of cases that have held that the requirement of stability is not absolute and must not be interpreted overly broadly.851 In particular, it does not in all circumstances affect the state's inherent right to exercise its sovereign power to respond to changing circumstances, for example with revisions in its legislation or legal system. As aptly put by the Tribunal in *Total*, in words with which the Tribunal is in full agreement, \"changes to general legislation, in the absence of specific stabilization promises to the foreign investor, reflect a legitimate exercise of the host state's governmental powers that are not prevented by a BIT's fair and equitable treatment standard\".852\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Continental Casualty*, para. 258 **(Ex. RLA-34)** and *AES*, para. 9.3.29 **(Ex. RLA-41)**.\n\n*Total* Decision on Liability, para. 164 **(Ex. RLA-28)**.\n\n572.\n\nThe next issue is whether the Respondent violated its obligation in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n573.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant's argument that the fact that the Incentive Regime was intended to attract foreign investment, in and of itself, meant that it also offered a commitment of stability and predictability to foreign investors. To support its argument, the Claimant points not only to the Act on Promotion, but also to the Explanatory Report and the implementing regulations. While the Tribunal acknowledges that the Explanatory Report in particular used terms such as \"stable\" and \"maintain\", the Tribunal considers that such language, in the absence of an express stabilization commitment, is insufficient to ground the obligation for which the Claimant contends. In particular, the use of such words in the context in which they appear did not, in the Tribunal's considered view, signal an undertaking by the Respondent, much less a specific undertaking to this Claimant, that there would be no changes whatsoever to the legal framework created by the Act on Promotion \u2013 in particular in the event of radically changed circumstances (such as the solar boom in 2009-2010, which fundamentally changed the financial soundness of the support regime). On any view, this would have been a far-reaching undertaking, with potentially extreme consequences for the Respondent and its citizens. No such agreement can be inferred from the few words or other matters relied upon by the Claimant.\n\n574.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal observes that the Solar Levy did not, in fact, repeal the fundamental features of the Incentive Scheme, as described earlier. The Claimant still received a stable FiT. The Solar Levy had either to be paid quarterly by the energy producer or it could be withheld by the energy distributor.\n\n575.\n\nFurther, and in any event, the Tribunal points out that the Tax Statute did not contain a reference to stability or to the maintenance of the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period.\n\n576.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the changes introduced by the Respondent to the Incentive Regime were part of the exercise of the Respondent's sovereign right to regulate tariffs \u2013 in particular in the context of the solar boom and its substantial adverse consequences as described earlier. They did not violate the Respondent's obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for foreign investment.\n\n577.\n\nThe Tribunal is confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that, even after the Solar Levy reduced excessive profits, PV investors still secured a more than reasonable return. Without the legislative amendments, the reference plant would have received a full payback in 7.8 years. Following the amendments, the payback could still be achieved in 9.9 years, and was therefore well below the promised 15 years.853 The return for the reference plant without the amendments would have been 11.4%, while - with the amendments - the return amounted to 8.4%, and hence remained well above the promised 7% return rate.854 In other words, despite the amendment measures, PV investments were as profitable - and in fact more profitable - than envisaged when the support system was created.\n\nFirst Expert Report by Mr. Michael Peer, dated 14 October 2015 (\"**First Peer Report**\"), para. 4.8.1: the pay back for the Claimant would have been 6.6 or 7.8 years respectively without amendments, and was 8 or 10.1 years respectively with the amendments, *i.e*., also well below the promised 15 years.\n\nFirst Peer Report, para. 4.8.3: The return for the Claimant would have been 14.4% or 11.5% respectively without the amendments and was 8% or 8.2% respectively with the amendments, *i.e.*, also well above the promised 7% return rate. All the measures together reduced the return for the 2009 reference plant from 8.4% to 7%; Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 230:8-18.\n\n**(2) Legitimate Expectations**\n-------------------------------\n\n578.\n\nAs for the second claim, the Claimant argues that the Respondent violated the Claimant's legitimate expectations by repealing the Tax Incentives and introducing the Solar Levy.\n\n579.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers that little, if any, guidance on the question of legitimate expectations may be gleaned from the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment. The Court in that case held that the petitioners did not have legitimate expectations as to the stability of the Incentive Regime. The Tribunal shares the Claimant's view that domestic court decisions cannot shield a State from international liability arising out of a treaty violation. Therefore, while certainly informative, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to engage with, or adopt, the reasoning of the Czech Constitutional Court.\n\n580.\n\nAs regards the relationship between regulatory autonomy of host States and the FET standard, especially in the context of legitimate expectations, the Tribunal subscribes to the view expressed by the Tribunal in *Micula*, which held that:\n\nThe fair and equitable treatment standard does not give a right to regulatory stability per se. The state has a right to regulate, and investors must expect that the legislation will change, absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurance giving rise to a legitimate expectation of stability. Thus, the Claimants' \"regulatory stability\" argument must be analyzed in the context of the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations.855\n\n*Micula*, para. 666 **(Ex. CLA-3)**.\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal is also entirely in agreement with the following reasoning of the *Micula* Tribunal:\n\nWhen the alleged legitimate expectation is one of regulatory stability, the reasonableness of the expectation must take into account the underlying presumption that, absent an assurance to the contrary, a state cannot be expected to freeze its laws and regulations. As noted by the Saluka tribunal, \u2018[n]o investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor's expectations was justified and reasonable, the host state's legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.' Accordingly, for a state to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard by changing the regulatory framework, the investor must have received a legitimate assurance that the relevant laws and regulations would not be changed in his or her respect.856\n\n*Micula*, para. 673 **(Ex. CLA-3)**.\n\n582.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal finds guidance in the approach of the Tribunal in *Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, which stated that:\n\nThe stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor's justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such expectations are an important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is mindful of their limitations. To be protected, the investor's expectations must be legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest.857\n\n*Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, para. 340 **(Ex. CLA-46)**.\n\n583.\n\nThe Parties essentially agree on the applicable test in this case to establish whether there has been a violation of an investor's legitimate expectations, namely: (a) whether the Respondent gave an assurance as to regulatory stability; (b) whether the Claimant effectively relied on such assurance; (c) whether this reliance was reasonable, taking into account the prevailing social and economic circumstances858 in the energy sector and at the time; (d) whether the Respondent violated the Claimant's legitimate expectations, bearing in mind that *de minimis* violations do not meet the necessary threshold for treaty violations.859 This test is consistent with the elements considered by other international tribunals.860\n\nAs pertinently expressed by the tribunal in *Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award, 16 September 2003, para. 20.37 **(Ex. CLA-51)** : \"it is relevant to consider the vicissitudes of the economy of the state that is host to the investment in determining the investor's legitimate expectations\".\n\nMemorial, para. 392; Counter-Memorial, para. 462.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Micula*, para. 668 **(Ex. CLA-3)**.\n\n584.\n\nEach of these elements is considered in turn below, in light of all the matters set out earlier in this Award.\n\na) The Respondent did not give any assurance as to regulatory stability.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nFirst, having carefully considered all materials and submissions before it, the Tribunal accepts that no assurance was ever given by the Respondent that the support system from which the Claimant benefitted would never change. The relevant tax legislation did not state for how long the favourable tax regime would be applicable. Equally, the Act on Promotion only provided that the revenues would depend on buy-out prices, which were established on the basis of criteria to be determined by ERO. It did not indicate that the FiT would remain unchanged for the duration of a plant's operation. Moreover, the ERO 2005 Technical Regulation, which implemented the determination of the FiT, had already been amended only two years later, in 2007, thus illustrating that in the energy sector, and certainly the Czech energy sector, regulatory changes were frequent. Moreover, the Tribunal fails to see how the Claimant could draw an assurance of legislative stability from a prospective 2003 Explanatory Report to the 2005 Act on Promotion, which stated that the forthcoming Act purported to achieve \"a stable promotion\" of investments. Nor does the Tribunal see how a mere mention in a 2009 ERO Report that the Act on Promotion brought a guarantee of long-term and stable promotion, could be understood as a confirmation of the Czech Republic's obligation not to alter the legislative framework. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that in the absence of a stabilization provision, the Incentive Regime could be altered whenever there was economic justification to do so.\n\n586.\n\nAs stated above with regard to the Respondent's treaty obligation to maintain a stable and predictable legal framework, in the absence of an express stabilization commitment, changes to address the solar boom were within the Respondent's regulatory power. And this all the more so, given that, ultimately, the changes in issue did not significantly undermine the actual support as originally envisaged.\n\n587.\n\nAs for the tax incentives in particular, contrary to the Claimant's position, the Tribunal considers that, fairly judged, the Respondent never created the impression that these incentives, which had already existed since 1992, could never be withdrawn. Moreover, these measures were not an integral part of the Incentive Regime in any event. They were only sporadically mentioned in the 2003 Explanatory Note issued two years before the Act on Promotion was promulgated. And they were not included in the presentations on, and descriptions of, the incentives for PV investments.\n\n588.\n\nIn all the circumstances, in the absence of any assurance by the Respondent, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant cannot have had a legitimate expectation that the Incentive Regime on which it relies would always remain in place and unchanged, and that the Respondent would be precluded from exercising its usual regulatory power in this regard.\n\nb) The Claimant did not rely upon any such assurance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n589.\n\nSecond, even if an assurance had been given by the Respondent, the Tribunal concludes that it was not, or would not have been, relied upon by the Claimant at the relevant time.\n\n590.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the relevant moment to assess whether the Claimant relied upon any alleged assurance as to the stability of the Incentive Regime is when the actual investment was made, *i.e.*, on 27 August to 7 September 2009, when SolarOne purchased from Mr. Szolony 90% of the share capital of Tomsan for CZK 74,350,861 Tomsan entered into the EPC contract,862 and the solar panels were bought.863 For the Tribunal, the Claimant's crucial investment commitments in the first project, Tomsan, occurred in the brief period of late August/early September 2009. It was then that, for the purpose of the present arbitration, the Claimant's investments were \"sunk\" in the first project.\n\nAgreement on transfer of a part of business share between Mr. Szolony, as seller, and SolarOne, as buyer, 27 August 2009 (**Ex. C-94**).\n\nNovy Ji\u010din \u2013 EPC Contract, 4 September 2009 (**Ex. C-101**).\n\nAgreement for the purchase of PV modules between ROAD International Co. Ltd. and TOMSAN s.r.o., 7 September 2009 (**Ex. R-231**).\n\n591.\n\nOn 29 December 2009, SolarOne purchased from Union Lesn\u00ed Br\u00e1na a.s. the entire share capital of Slune\u010dn\u00ed park Dub\u00ed for CZK 2,200.864 However, it took over three months before the contract for the installation of the solar panels was concluded on 8 April 2010.865 Comparing the relatively low costs for the acquisition of the SPV Slune\u010dn\u00ed and its solar license (CZK 2,200,000) with the costs for the installation works (EUR 262,000) and the acquisition of the solar panels (EUR 2,044,880.60), the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's investment in the second project, Slune\u010dn\u00ed, was \"sunk\" in April 2010.\n\nAgreement on transfer of business share between Union Lesn\u00ed Br\u00e1na, as seller, and SolarOne, as buyer, 3 November 2009 (**Ex. C-98**).\n\nDub\u00ed \u2013 EPC contract, 8 April 2010 (**Ex. C-106**).\n\n592.\n\nThe Claimant appears to agree that the latter two points in time are relevant for the Tribunal's assessment.866\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 41:8-11 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\n593.\n\nThe actual date on which the operations were started was later, upon connection to the grid, and is obviously of less importance for the purposes of determining the basis upon which the investment was made.\n\n594.\n\nTherefore, the relevant time period for the Tribunal's enquiry is between late August/early September 2009 and April 2010 respectively.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal has seen no evidential basis that either (a) when the investment decision was made on 29 October 2008 or (b) when it actually acquired the share capital of Tomsan s.r.o. 27 August 2009 and of Slune\u010dn\u00ed on 29 December 2009, or (c) during the period from late August/early September 2009 and April 2010, the Claimant was, in fact, aware of the statements of the Czech Authorities to which it now refers, or that it actually relied upon them.\n\n596.\n\nThe Claimant did not investigate public statements before it invested in either the first project, Tomsan, or in the second, Slune\u010dn\u00ed. Instead, it relied upon a feasibility study from Worthald and Partners of October 2008, as it was \"actively involved in the process of selecting the most attractive investment opportunities\" in the Czech Republic. It was the consultancy firm which actually identified which investments in solar energy production would be the most beneficial after having \"reviewed hundreds of prospective prospects\".867 The Claimant fully relied on this feasibility study as confirmed by one of its shareholders, Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd, who also happened to be the managing partner of \"Worthald and Parner.\"868 The consultants, upon which the Claimant relied to make its investments, envisaged the possibility of a change in the legal system (FiT), although they still considered it \"not probable\" in October 2008. Nevertheless, the consulants, i.a. Mr. Chroustovsk\u00fd, in his capacity as a board member and shareholder of SolarOne, continued to warn SolarOne and the Claimant of the risk of legislative changes in the summor of 2009.869 For the consultants this imponderability could simply be addressed: in the event of a change in the law, its advice was \"stop project and suit [sic] Czech Republic upon investment protection agreement\".870 There is no indication that the Claimant has done anything more than rely on the feasibility study of its experts and their advice to claim compensation under an investment treaty in case of legal change. Such strategy goes squarely against the allegation that the Claimant made its investments in reliance upon relevant assurances it received from the competent authorities.\n\nFirst Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, para. 24.\n\nFirst Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement, para. 24.\n\nMemorandum prepared by Worthald Partners in summer 2009 to secure a senior debt facility, p. 102 (**Annex XII to First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**).\n\nFeasibility study prepared by Worthald Partners in October 2008, p. 38 (**Annex IX to Statement First Chroustovsk\u00fd Statement**).\n\n597.\n\nMoreover, the Tax Opinion the Claimant obtained on 15 July 2009, *i.e.*, well before the investment in the first project, indicated that the then-applicable provisions on depreciation \"may at any time change. The prepared new act on income tax already features some stricter provisions\".871 Consequently, even before the investment in the first project was made, Solar One and the Claimant as its shareholder, were warned that the subsidy regime would change.\n\nTax Analysis of the Operation of Photovoltaic Power Plants, 15 July 2009 (**Ex. R-228**).\n\n598.\n\nIn any event, the promotional activities, upon which the Claimant allegedly relies, contained a warning that the legislation may change.\n\nc) Any such reliance would not have been reasonable\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nThird, even if the Claimant relied on some alleged \"stabilization\" assurances from the Czech Authorities \u2013 *quod non* \u2013 any such reliance would not have been reasonable.\n\n600.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal considers that the 3 November 2008 letter from ERO, which explained how the Incentive Regime worked, could not form the basis for a legitimate expectation one and a half years later in a drastically changed situation.\n\n601.\n\nEqually, the Tribunal does not consider that the 2009 ERO Report, which hinted that the Act on Promotion guaranteed a long-term and stable promotion, was sufficient a basis upon which the Claimant could form a legitimate expectation, given the legal status of this document (merely a report from an administrative body) and the vague nature of its wording.\n\n602.\n\nFurther still, and as explained at some length above, the Tribunal finds that already at the relevant times (late August/early September 2009 and April 2010) there had been an accumulation of apparent warning signs that ought to have precluded any such expectation on the part of the Claimant and, objectively viewed, did preclude the possibility that the Claimant might be said reasonably to have relied on any such alleged assurances.\n\n603.\n\nIt was manifest in 2009-2010 that the FiT could no longer be maintained unchanged. It was clear that, for this purpose, the 5% limitation rule would be abandoned for future plants. Moreover, it became evident that the abolition of the 5% limitation for future plants would not, of itself, be sufficient to address what had become an unreasonable and unsustainable support system for plants which entered into operation in 2009 and 2010. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Claimant was not reasonably entitled to expect that no measures would be taken with regard to the FiT for plants in operation before 2011. The changes that were promulgated were within the reasonable discretion of the State.\n\n604.\n\nIn all the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant could not have had a reasonable or legitimate expectation concerning the continuation of the support regime without any modification, and it could not reasonably have purported to rely on any alleged assurances to that effect.\n\nd) No violation of legitimate expectations because of EU law\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n605.\n\nThe Tribunal observes additionally that the law of the European Union on State Aid precluded, in any event, any legitimate expectation that plants which entered into operation in 2009-2010 would necessarily maintain the benefit of the support system as it then existed, as long as this support system was not duly notified.\n\n606.\n\nNotably the very first line of the Act on Promotion, which is the cornerstone of the solar support regime, explicitly referred to the EU legislation, which prevails over the provisions of the Act. Indeed, under the heading \"Object of Regulation\" the first line of Article 1(1) reads: \"This Act regulates, in accordance with the legislation of the European Communities, the method of promoting the production of electricity from renewable energy sources\u2026\". The legislation of the European Communities includes crucial sections on competition law, among which are provisions on State Aid. The fact that this explicit reference to the legislation of the European Communities was accompanied by a footnote mentioning Directive 2001/77 on the promotion of electricity produced by renewable energy sources does not alter the fact that the Act on Promotion referred to the whole body of Community Law, including its mandatory provisions on State aid.\n\n607.\n\nIt is undisputed by the Parties that within each of the Member States, including, of course, the Czech Republic, EU law forms part of the domestic law. Its mandatory rules, including its mandatory provisions on State aid, apply therein. Moreover, it is clear that mandatory rules of EU law have primacy over even mandatory rules of domestic law.\n\n608.\n\nThe argument has been made that the profits, which the Claimant would have drawn from the production of solar electricity (in the absence of the Solar Levy or the Tax Amendments), were prohibited under Article 107(1) of the TFEU. This provides:\n\nany aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market.872\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 247.\n\n609.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, does not itself need to dwell on the compatibility of the support system with the EU internal market, given that the EC, by its Decision of 28 November 2016, concluded that the subsidies under the RES Scheme for plants commissioned between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2012 constituted State aid under Article 107(3) TFEU.873 In the Tribunal's view, that Decision provides the authoritative answer to the detailed debate between the Parties as to whether the EU provisions on State aid were engaged here.874\n\nEC, State aid decision SA.40171 (2015/NN) \u2014 \"Czech Republic \u2014 Promotion of electricity production from renewable energy sources\", Decision, 28 November 2016, paras. 11, 84, 94, 126 **(Ex. R-411**).\n\nRelying on *PreussenElektra AG v. Schleswag AG,* ECJ Judgment, Case C-378/98, 13 March 2001 (**Ex. CLA-1**) the Claimant argued that \"an economic advantage benefiting certain undertakings does not constitute State aid within the meaning and scope of Article 107(1) TFEU where the advantage in question is not financed through State resources but is instead financed by private undertakings pursuant to a purchase obligation imposed by the State\". The Claimant alleged that this principle had not been overruled by subsequent cases. With respect to the RES support scheme set out in the original Act on Promotion, the Claimant explained that the original funding scheme did not involve any transfer of State resources because the legislation required the grid operators to pay both the FiT and the Green Bonuses from their own private budget. With respect to the new RES support scheme introduced by Act No. 402/2010 and the 2013 New Act on Promotion, the Claimant argued as follows: First, the Claimant did not make its investment under these new schemes, therefore their compliance with EU law is irrelevant to the present case. Second, the new funding mechanism did not involve State resources. With respect to Act No. 402/2010, which introduced the Solar Levy, the Claimant alleged that \"even if the amendments introduced by Act No. 402/2010 entailed State aid, such aid would in any event not be granted to solar producers\" since the resources from the levy were paid to transmission and grid system operators.  \nThe Respondent, from its side, observed that the law regarding EU State aid rules for RES schemes has developed since the famous decision in *PreussenElektra,* which is applicable when \"the purchase obligation in question was financed entirely from the private resources of the grid operators themselves\" (Rejoinder, para. 292; Counter-Memorial, para. 282, *referring to Essent Netwerk Noord,* ECJ Judgment, Case C-206/06, 17 July 2008 **(Ex. RLA-70)**; *Association Vent De Col\u00e8re!,* ECJ Judgment, *C* ase C-262/12, 19 December 2013 **(Ex. RLA-71**); *Austria v. Commission*, Judgment of the Tribunal of the European Union, Case T-251/11, 18 May 2011 **(Ex. RLA-72)**; Counter-Memorial, paras. 274-284; Rejoinder, paras. 291-293). The Respondent further referred to the EC's January 2014 Draft Notice on the Notion of State aid, which comprehensively reflects the EC's current position on public support schemes (Counter-Memorial, para. 283, *referring to* Draft Commission Notice on the notion of State aid pursuant to Article 107(1) TFEU, 17 January 2014, para. 66 **(Ex. RLA-73**). This Draft Notice provides as follows: surcharges imposed by law on private persons can be qualified as State resources. It is the case even where a private company is appointed by law to collect such charges on behalf of the State and to channel them to the beneficiaries, without allowing the collecting company to use the proceeds from the charges for purposes other than those provided for by the law. In this case, the sums in question remain under public control and are therefore available to the national authorities, which is sufficient reason for them to be considered State resources.\n\n610.\n\nFor the present case, it is also irrelevant that the EC decided in 2016 that \u2013 at that time \u2013 the return yielded by the solar support regime, based upon the Act on Promotion, but corrected by a Solar Levy of 26% for the years 2011-2013 and 10% as of 2014, had brought the return back to a reasonable level, so that the support was no longer illegal State aid under EU law. The enquiry for present purposes concerns the period before this, in 2009-2010. Nor is it significant that the Decision did not spell out in express terms that the solar support regime without the Solar Levy would, on the contrary, constitute illegal aid.875\n\nEC, State aid decision SA.40171 (2015/NN) \u2014 \"Czech Republic \u2014 Promotion of electricity production from renewable energy sources\", Decision, 28 November 2016 (**Ex. R-411**).\n\n611.\n\nFurther still, as will be apparent from the discussion below, the question whether the support regime, if State aid, would be exempted under Article 108 TFEU (again an issue much debated by the Parties) is immaterial for the present case.\n\n612.\n\nThe basic rule with regard to State aid under EU law is that State aid is only permitted when it has been approved by the EC. As summarized by Ms. Bacon in her First Expert Report, it is \"very well established that, in principle, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not entertain any legitimate expectation that is lawful, unless it has been granted in accordance with the procedure set out in Article. 108 TFEU.\"876\n\nFirst Expert Report by Ms. Kelyn Bacon QC, dated 5 October 2015 (\"**First Bacon Report**\"), para. 113, *citing Commission v. Germany*, Case C-5/89, 20 September 1990, para. 14 **(Ex. RLA-89)**; *France T\u00e9l\u00e9com v. Commission*, Case C-81/10 P, 8 December 2011, para. 59 **(Ex. RLA-90)**, *both holding* that a \"diligent [businessman/business operator] should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed\"\n\n613.\n\nConsequently, the relevant question is whether, at the time the investment was made, the EC had, upon due notification, positively decided that the solar support regime was compatible with EU law. In the absence of due notification and any such decision, the investor \u2013 as in the present case \u2013 was not entitled to hold any legitimate expectations that the un-notified support system would not be changed. The Tribunal is aware that the Czech Republic had stated in the Explanatory Report of November 2003 that the future Act on Promotion would be \"compatible with the public aid law of the European Union\".877 The Republic repeated that view in a few instances up to 2009. However, statements from domestic authorities cannot give rise to legitimate expectations when they are counter to mandatory EU law. In its 2016 Decision, the EC formally confirmed that the Incentive Regime, as applicable to installations commissioned between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2012, constituted State aid. Statements from domestic authorities cannot alter this. Given that it is not for a Member State to declare its own aid schemes compatible with EU law, any such declaration cannot be a basis for a legitimate expectation.\n\nExplanatory Report on the bill of the Act on Promotion, 12 November 2003, p. 6 (**Ex. C-78**).\n\n614.\n\nNeither can legitimate expectations be based upon the letter of 27 July 2004 from the EC (the \"**27 July 2004 Letter**\"), which was written in response to a complaint of 16 December 2003 from the Czech Society of Wind Energy and EUROSOLAR. In that letter, the EC stated \u2013 on the basis of the 2003 draft of the Act \u2013 that incentives under the Act on Promotion did not constitute State aid because the Investment Regime did not involve State resources.878\n\nReply, para. 443.\n\n615.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the 27 July 2004 Letter was a sufficient basis for its legitimate expectations.879 An EC decision can create legitimate expectations, even if it does not address specific individuals as long as the decision is widely disseminated and known.880 In the present case, the decision was widely disseminated and known, because it was sent to the two main industry associations in the RES sector, *i.e.*, the Czech Society of Wind Energy and EUROSOLAR.881 Referring to *Athina\u00efki Techniki v Commission,* the Claimant further submits that the Court of Justice of the European Union has held that the EC's letter by which it decided that there was no breach of EU law and that no further investigations would be conducted, amounts to a formal decision on which the Claimant can rely.882\n\nReply, paras. 443-446.\n\nReply, para. 444.\n\nReply, paras. 442-444.\n\nReply, para. 448, *referring to Athina\u00efki Techniki v. Commission*, Case C-521/06P, 17 July 2008 **(Annex X to Quigley Report) (\"*****Athina\u00efki***\").\n\n616.\n\nAccording to the Claimant:\n\nThe right to rely on the principle of legitimate expectations constitutes one of the fundamental principles of EU State aid law. It extends to any person who is in a situation in which it is clear that the EU authorities have, by giving precise assurances, led him to entertain legitimate expectations. Regardless of the form in which it is communicated, information that is precise, unconditional and consistent and comes from an authorised and reliable source constitutes such assurance.883\n\nReply, para. 441, *referring to* Quigley Report, para. 149.\n\n617.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Claimant could have had legitimate expectations as to the compatibility of the Respondent's incentive scheme with EU State aid law.884 According to the Respondent, such legitimate expectations may only arise if \"precise, unconditional and consistent assurances originating from authorised, reliable sources [were] given to the person concerned by the competent authorities of the European Union\".885 Contrary to the Claimant's argument, the Respondent maintains that the EC's 27 July 2004 Letter was insufficient to create legitimate expectations.886 The 27 July 2004 Letter only addressed a 2003 draft (on the basis of information provided by EUROSOLAR) which differed substantially from the 2005 Act on Promotion. Neither the draft, nor the information provided by EUROSOLAR explained \u2013 nor indeed could have explained \u2013 the precise funding mechanism of the RES Scheme and the amount of the FiT.

Nor did it constitute a formal decision.888 To this end, the decision of the Court of Justice in *Athina\u00efki*889 is to be distinguished, since in that case it was held that a letter issued by the EC, which did, in fact, close the file on a complaint, constituted a formal decision.890 Furthermore, the EC was entitled to change its initial assessment, which was based on the reasoning in *PreussenElektra*, in light of subsequent developments in European case law after 2004.891 Finally, according to the Respondent, the Claimant did not directly rely on the 27 July 2004 Letter in any event.892 In response to the Claimant's allegation that it \"relied on the [27] July 2004 Letter indirectly, because that letter was \u2018relied on by the Respondent\" in, for example, the drafting of the Explanatory Report on the Act on Promotion, the Respondent notes that the Explanatory Report was drafted nine months before the 27 July 2004 Letter.893\n\nRejoinder, para. 320.\n\n*Athina\u00efki* **(Annex X to Quigley Report)**.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 270-273; Rejoinder, para. 320.\n\nRejoinder, para. 324.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 325-328.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 341-343.\n\n619.\n\nWith regard to the EC's subsequent enquires, it is the Respondent's position that the EC did not take any formal decision by which it would be bound in respect of the applicability of the State aid rule on the Incentive Regime.894 Hence, when it confirmed that the exemption of \"ecological tax\" did not amount to State aid in a different case, the EC expressly noted that such a decision did not bind its future position.895\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 274, 275.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 275.\n\n620.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent's analysis on this issue. The Tribunal does not consider that the 27 July 2004 Letter constitutes a basis for legitimate expectations, since it addressed no more than a legislative draft, and it did so in response to a general complaint from professional organisations that the envisaged act would favour particular energy producers and state companies.896 For the purposes of its analysis, the EC did not have \u2013 and could not have had \u2013 information about the exact funding mechanism of the RES Scheme and the amount of the FiT, as these modalities were only put in place in 2005.897 Moreover, by definition, the decision of the EC with respect to a draft of possible future legislation could only be preliminary. The provisional scope of the 27 July 2004 Letter is well illustrated by its last paragraph: \"Should you learn of any new particulars that might demonstrate the existence of an infringement of the State aid rules, I would be grateful if you would inform my department as soon as possible\"898 In all the circumstances, it is clear that the EC did not intend to render a final and binding decision on the future Act on Promotion on the basis of the limited information it had received with regard to the 2003 draft of that law. And as held by the Court of Justice in the *Athina\u00efki* judgment, a formal Decision by the EC would require an intention on its part to state a definitive position.\n\nLetters from the Czech Society of Wind Energy EUROSOLAR respectively to Mr. Monti and Mr. Loyola de Palacio, 16 December 2003 **(Ex. C-75)**.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 273; Rejoinder, para. 324.\n\nLetter from the EC to EUROSOLAR, 27 July 2004 **(Ex. C-77)**.\n\n621.\n\nIt follows that, in the Tribunal's view, the 27 July 2004 Letter was not a Decision. Furthermore, even if it could be construed as such in 2004 when it was rendered, under the *Athina\u00efki* judgment, this still does not mean that the Decision could have given rise to legitimate expectations in 2009 or 2010. As was pointed out in the *Athina\u00efki* judgment, the Decision would only remain applicable for so long as no new information became available.899 Here, new and significant information did become available after 2004 (namely the final text of the Act on Promotion and the specific financial incentives thereby established).\n\n*Athina\u00efki*, paras. 48-51 **(Annex X to Quigley Report)**.\n\n622.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's conclusion that the 27 July 2004 Letter and other statements discussed above could not have led to legitimate expectations, there is no need for the Tribunal to inquire into the question of reasonable reliance by the Claimant upon the matters in question when it made its investment.\n\n623.\n\nIn summary, when the investments were made, the Incentive Regime, although State aid, had not been notified to, and approved by, the EC. Under EU law, it therefore follows that as at that time, there could not have been any legitimate expectations as alleged by the Claimant.\n\n**(3) Transparency**\n--------------------\n\n624.\n\nIn a third step, the Tribunal must next consider whether the Respondent breached its obligation towards the Claimant to act in a transparent manner.\n\n625.\n\nIt is clear that the FET standard entails a transparency component \u2013 as confirmed by the text of Article 10(1) of the ECT, which refers in terms to \"transparent conditions for Investors\".\n\n626.\n\nThe concept of transparency is closely related to an investor's legitimate expectations. Dolzer and Schreuer define transparency as follows: \"Transparency means that the legal framework for the investor's operations is readily apparent and that any decisions affecting the investor can be traced back to that legal framework.\"900 In addition, the Tribunal considers that transparency must include a requirement that information about relevant changes in the investment framework are communicated well in advance.\n\nDolzer/Schreuer, p. 149 **(Ex. CLA-29)**.\n\n627.\n\nAs noted above, it is the investor's expectations at the time of the investment that are relevant for the Tribunal's assessment, *i.e.*, in the period between 27 August to 7 September 2009 for the Tomsan investment and in April 2010 for the Slune\u010dn\u00ed investment.901\n\n*See above* paras. 590-591.\n\n628.\n\nThe possibility that a Solar Levy would be introduced by 1 January 2011 was considered on 23 July 2010902 and was formally announced on 20 October 2010.903 As noted earlier in this Award, the Tribunal has no doubt that it was already obvious at the time of the investment that the sharp increase in the number of PV power plants connecting to the grid would lead to a crisis. Because of the rush of new investments made in the PV sector in the last months of 2010, the introduction of measures as of 2011 became an inevitability. On the other hand, investors knew that the caretaker government that was in place in the Czech Republic at that time would not take substantial policy decisions as it did not have the necessary political support. Parliamentary elections were substantially delayed. A viable and politically sustainable government was only established in July 2010.\n\n*See* P. Novotn\u00fd, \"The Minister of Environment Wants to Tax Solar Power Plants,\" Mlada Fronta Dnes, 23 July 2010 **(Ex. R-206)** *and* T. Zavadilova, \"Solar boom is over,\" E15, 30 July 2010 **(Ex. R-207)**.\n\n*See* Government of the Czech Republic, \"Electricity prices will increase by 5.5% at maximum\" (vlada.cz), 20 October 2010 **(Ex. R-219)**.\n\n629.\n\nConsidering (1) that there was an obvious and transparent need for the Incentive Regime to be changed; (2) that there was a political vacuum until July 2010; and (3) the dramatic increase of PV plant grid connections in the last months of 2010, the Tribunal holds that the Czech Republic was as transparent as it could have been in the circumstances.\n\n630.\n\nIn all the circumstances, as detailed earlier in this Award, the Tribunal therefore does not consider that the Respondent violated its obligation under the FET standard to act in a transparent manner.\n\n**B. WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE OBLIGATION TO GRANT FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent breached its obligation to grant full protection and security (\"**FPS**\") by introducing the Solar Levy and repealing the Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period.904 The obligation to provide FPS is contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT.905\n\nMemorial, paras. 331, 332; Rejoinder, para. 634.\n\nMemorial, paras. 335-337.\n\n632.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security [\u2026].906\n\nMemorial, para. 336.\n\n633.\n\nThe Claimant submits that while, historically, the FPS standard was restricted to mere physical protection, its scope has been extended over time to encompass legal protection.907 In particular, referring to *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*,908*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,*909*National Grid P.L.C. v. Argentina Republic*,910 and *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania,*911 the Claimant submits that the FPS standard requires host States to provide a secure and stable investment environment to protect investors.912\n\nMemorial, para.348, *referring to* Dolzer/Schreuer, p. 149 **(Ex. CLA-29)**.\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award, 13 September 2001, para 613 **(Ex. CLA-38)**.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12.

Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2000, para. 89 **(Ex. CLA-31)**; *Occidental*, para. 187 **(Ex. CLA-32)**; *PSEG*, para. 258 **(Ex. CLA-33)**; *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

RLA-25)**; *Rupert Binder v. Czech Republic*, Award, 15 July 2011, para. 477 **(Ex. CLA-36)**.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n635.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the introduction of the Solar Levy and the repeal of the Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period did not constitute a violation of the FPS standard for the same reasons that they did not constitute a violation of the FET standard.914\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 455-461.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n636.\n\nGiven the way this particular allegation has been framed, it can be addressed briefly.\n\n637.\n\nThe Parties agree that a guarantee of \"constant\" or \"full\" protection and security is afforded to foreign investments under Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Parties also agree that the legal test as to whether a violation of this standard has occurred in the present case largely overlaps with the test applicable to violations of the FET standard. This is because the Claimant puts its case in terms of the \"legal\", and not the \"physical\", dimension of the FPS standard as interpreted by international tribunals, which it has articulated in terms of the host country's obligation to guarantee a secure and stable investment environment to protect foreign investments.\n\n638.\n\nGiven the overlap in standards, the Tribunal refers simply to its earlier analysis. For the reasons that have been fully explored above in the context of the FET standard, the Tribunal finds that no violation of the FPS standard has occurred in this case.\n\n**C. WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE PROHIBITION OF IMPAIRMENT THROUGH ARBITRARY AND DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Whether the Claimant's Investment was Significantly Impaired by the Respondent's Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n639.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent violated the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory treatment (\"**Non-Impairment Standard**\") contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT by acting in an unreasonable and inconsistent manner.915\n\nMemorial, para. 446; Reply, para. 759.\n\n640.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides:\n\n[\u2026] no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures th[e] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal [of Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties] [\u2026]\n\n641.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that the Claimant's investment was not significantly impaired, the Claimant, relying on the tribunal's decision in *Saluka*,916 suggests that any negative impact on investment is sufficient to constitute an impairment.917\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V. v. The Czech Republic*, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, para. 458 **(Ex. CLA-43)**.\n\nReply, para. 764.\n\n642.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's amendment measures had a material effect upon the SolarOne's profitability. SolarOne's value suffered a significant drop, and the Claimant lost the opportunity to sell its shareholding in SolarOne.918\n\nMemorial, para. 472-474; Reply, paras. 762, 763.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n643.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the amendment measures were reasonable and appropriate and that therefore they do not amount to a violation of the Non-Impairment Standard.919 The Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that any negative effects on investments, however minor, satisfy the impairment requirement.920 In the Respondent's view, the impairment must be \"significant\" before it can amount to a violation of the treaty standard.921 A mere imposition of tax measures or a simple repeal of a tax exemption is not sufficient to satisfy this requirement.922\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 502-503.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 564, 565.\n\nRejoinder, para. 566.\n\nRejoinder, para. 566, *referring to* *Occidental*, paras. 2-3, 161 **(Ex.

RLA-39)**.\n\n644.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant fails to establish any such significant impact.923 The Claimant \"was free to use the solar power plants to generate substantial revenue\" even after the introduction of the amendment measures.924 The Respondent also points out that the Claimant's plants continue to enjoy the 15-year payback period and the 7% return rate despite the Taxation Measures.925 In addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimant received a share purchase offer in relation to SolarOne.926\n\nRejoinder, para. 566.\n\nRejoinder, para. 567, *referring to* *Perenco*, paras. 597-599 **(Ex.

Rather, it has focussed solely on the alleged diminution of the plant's value.928\n\nRejoinder, para. 568.\n\nRejoinder, para. 569.\n\n**2. Whether the Respondent's Measures were Arbitrary or Discriminatory**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Whether the Respondent Pursued a Rational Policy**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n646.\n\nThe Claimant submits that in order to establish a violation of the Non-Impairment Standard, the Tribunal should apply a \"means-to-an-end\" reasonableness test to analyse the reasonableness of the Respondent's measures: a State's measure is reasonable if (1) the State pursues a rational policy; and (2) the State acts in a reasonable manner when implementing the policy.929\n\nMemorial, paras. 449-451; Reply, para. 783.\n\n647.\n\nRelying on *AES*,930 the Claimant explains that (1) a policy is rational \"if it is taken \u2018following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter'\"; and (2) an implementation measure is reasonable \"if there is \u2018an appropriate correlation between the state's policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it'\".931\n\n*AES*, paras. 10.3.7, 10.3.8, 10.3.9 **(Ex. RLA-41)**.\n\nMemorial, para. 451, 453.\n\n648.\n\nIn relation to the first prong of the reasonableness test, the Claimant rejects the argument that, since the purpose of the adopted measures was to eliminate excessive profits and to relieve consumers and the State budget of an additional burden, the Respondent pursued a rational policy. This is for a number of reasons.932\n\nMemorial, paras. 454, 466.\n\n649.\n\nFirst, the Claimant alleges that the Incentive Regime did not give rise to windfall profits.933 The photovoltaic investors only received a 10-15% return, which is consistent with return rates in other EU markets.934 In this vein, the Claimant emphasizes that the explanatory report on Act No. 402/2010 Coll., which introduced the Solar Levy, did not speak in terms of windfall profits.935\n\nMemorial, para. 459; Reply, paras. 785, 786, 788.\n\nReply para. 786.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 70:19-71:4, *referring to* Explanatory Report on Act No. 402/2010 Coll, 2010 **(Ex. R-14)**.\n\n650.\n\nSecond, according to the Claimant, since \"the Respondent facially destroyed the Claimant's rights and interests\", the Respondent has to prove that \"the maintenance of the Incentive Regime, and the allegedly resulting high electricity prices, would have entailed the catastrophic consequences for the Czech economy\", in order to demonstrate the rationality of its policy.936 However, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has not shown that any specific harm existed at the time of the adoption of the measures.937 On the contrary, the extra cost per unit for RES support, and the growth in electricity tariffs and electricity prices were low in the Czech Republic when the amendment measures were adopted.938 Industrial production in the Czech Republic was growing in 2010.939 The budget deficits of the Czech Republic were at the lowest level among the EU Member States.940 The Claimant also notes that host States may not intervene in, or interfere with, private investments \"simply in the name of purported threats of its national economy\".941\n\nMemorial, para. 456.\n\nMemorial, para. 457.\n\nReply, para. 787.\n\nHearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 15:6-13.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 47:10-11.\n\nMemorial, paras. 455-456.\n\n651.\n\nThird, according to the Claimant, the Respondent's policy was not rational as there was no urgent need to change the Incentive Regime, on which the Claimant relied, before the EC had intervened.942 In support of this argument, the Claimant relies on the award in *AES*,943 in which the tribunal found that Hungary was not obliged to limit potential State aid before the EC issued its decision.944 In the Claimant's view, Professor Stern's dissent in *AES* is not pertinent in the present case, as the EC did not put pressure on the Czech Government in the case at hand.945\n\nMemorial, paras. 457-459.\n\n*AES*, para*.* 10.3.16 **(Ex. RLA-41)**.\n\nMemorial, para. 464.\n\nMemorial, para. 465.\n\n652.\n\nFourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's policy retroactively to withdraw the promised profits led to the Czech Government losing its international reputation as a profitable destination for foreign investment.946 This is further proof of the irrationality of the Respondent's policy, because without foreign investment the Respondent will likely fail to meet the EU's 2020 target, by which it is still bound.947\n\nMemorial, para. 460.\n\nMemorial, para. 460.\n\n653.\n\nFifth, the Claimant adds that if there were any alleged windfall profits, they were caused by the Respondent's policy choice to enact the Incentive Regime and the Respondent's failure to calculate the relevant costs properly.948\n\nMemorial, para. 458.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n654.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a measure is reasonable, if it is reasonably connected to a rational policy.949 The Respondent notes that the general presumption is that a State's exercise of its regulatory power will be reasonable and that this test does not require or, in fact, entitle the Tribunal to second guess a State's policy or a measure that it seeks to introduce.950\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 515; Rejonder, paras. 562, 570-574.\n\nRejoinder, para. 575; Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 231:8-11.\n\n655.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a host State's policy is rational \"if it has been adopted \u2018following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.'\"951 In this regard, the Respondent objects to the Claimant's allegation that the Respondent must prove that \"the Incentive Regime [\u2026] would have entailed [\u2026] catastrophic consequences for the Czech economy\", alleging that no tribunal has requested a host State to prove that \"near-calamitous consequences would have occurred, but for the State's intervention.\"952 The Respondent also notes that tribunals have found a broad variety of policy objections to be \"rational\", including \"the protection of consumers, accession to the European Union, and regulation of the windfall gains of a certain sector.\"953\n\nRejoinder, para. 577; Counter-Memorial, para. 528 *referring to AES*, para 10.3.8 **(Ex.

Whether the Respondent's Measures were Intrinsically Unreasonable**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the repeal of incentive assurances was intrinsically unreasonable,992 especially when, as here, the Respondent first promised a long-term incentive regime to meet a certain policy goal, and then repealed the promised incentive in relation to existing investors.993\n\nReply, para. 765.\n\nReply, paras. 766, 767.\n\n669.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's measures were irrational, because they changed the fundamental features of the Incentive Regime.994 In support of its argument, the Claimant relies on the general principle articulated in *Charanne*995 that \"the existence of a guaranteed tariff throughout the lifetime of the facility is an essential characteristic of an incentive regime.\"996 The Claimant contends, however, that the actual conclusion of the tribunal in *Charanne* does not apply to the present case, since the claimants in *Charanne* invoked an unreasonably long 30-50 years guarantee period, and the tribunal in that case emphasized that the decision was based on case specific circumstances.997\n\nReply, para. 768.\n\n*Charanne*, paras. 514, 539 **(Ex.

Furthermore, the Claimant has still been receiving the FiT.1000 The Respondent relies on the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court, which concluded that the Solar Levy did not alter the RES scheme.1001\n\nRejoinder, para. 588.\n\nRejoinder, para. 588, *referring to* May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, para. 68 **(Ex.

Whether the Respondent Acted in an Inconsistent Manner**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n673.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent acted in an inconsistent manner in relation to statements given to investors and in respect of its ultimate policy goal.1003\n\nReply, para. 776.\n\n674.\n\nIn relation to investors, the Respondent first announced that the regime changes would only apply to new investments made on or after 1 January 2011, but eventually it applied it to all investments made between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010.1004 With respect to the policy goal, the Respondent first attempted to achieve its EU target for both the years 2010 and 2020, 8% and 13% respectively.1005 However, the Respondent's retroactive measures then made it impossible to achieve the 2020 goal, because the Respondent lost international credibility after the amendment measures.1006\n\nReply, paras. 777-779.\n\nReply paras. 780, 781.\n\nReply, para. 782.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n675.\n\nThe Respondent dismisses the Claimant's argument that, since the Respondent's measures were \"inconsistent\", the measures were unreasonable.1007 According to the Respondent, whether a State measure is objectively arbitrary should be assessed by the reasonableness test as indicated above, and according to which the Respondent's measures must be considered reasonable as appropriately tailored instruments to address the solar boom.1008\n\nRejoinder, para. 573.\n\nRejoinder, para. 574.\n\n**5. Whether the Respondent Contributed to the Rise of the Solar Boom**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n676.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent cannot justify its amendment measures, since the allegedly excessive burden on consumers and the State budget, arising out of the rapid increase in solar investments, was caused by the Respondent's own conduct.1009 The Claimant submits that Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001 provides that a State cannot invoke the necessity defence, if it \"has contributed to the situation of necessity\" and that this general rule should apply in the present case.1010\n\nMemorial, para. 471; Reply, para. 794.\n\nReply, para. 756*.*\n\n677.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the Act on Promotion, especially the 5% rule, cannot be regarded as a good faith mistake; rather it was the Respondent's active policy choice to attract investors.1011 Since the Respondent was well aware in October 2009 that a significant number of photovoltaic power plants would be installed in 2010, it had enough time to react promptly and to issue a warning to discourage prospective investors, such that retroactive changes to the Incentive Scheme would not have become necessary.1012 As support for this, the Claimant submits that Mr. Jones, the Respondent's expert, accepted that it was \"relatively easy to estimate\" the costs on consumers and that the Czech Technical University predicted a drop of installation costs by more than 50%.1013 Rather, in the Claimant's view, the Respondent used the rapid increase in the installation of solar plants in order to meet the 8% Indicative 2010 Target.1014\n\nReply, para. 796.\n\nReply, paras. 797-801.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 9:18-11:14, *referring to* Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 148:8-19, 131:19-23.\n\nHearing Transcript (27 May 2017), 44:14-20.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n678.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's position that the solar boom was caused by the Respondent's mismanagement.1015\n\nRejoinder, para. 592.\n\n679.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the rapid increase of solar installations was unpredictable, given the novelty of the photovoltaic technology and the dramatic fall in the cost of the photovoltaic module.1016\n\nHearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 81:15-82:8.\n\n680.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that it reacted to the solar boom in a practical and timely manner, stating that the caretaker government, which was in place between May 2009 and July 2010, lacked authority to implement politically contentious legislative changes.1017 The moratorium for grid connection in February 2010 was also timely, because the Czech Government needed to obtain sufficient data before imposing it.1018 In the Respondent's view, photovoltaic energy investors rushed into the market to take advantage of the 5% rule when it became known that the Czech Government was considering its abolition.1019\n\nHearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 157:12-22.\n\nHearing Transcript (3 March 2017), 128:7-19.\n\nRejoinder, para. 592.\n\n681.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent notes that the Claimant's reference to Article 25(2)(b) of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility is misplaced, because the Respondent has not invoked the necessity defence.1020\n\nRejoinder, paras. 590, 591.\n\n**6. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n682.\n\nThe Parties are divided as to whether the Respondent's withdrawal of the Tax Incentives and the introduction of the Solar Levy amount to violations of the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory treatment.\n\n683.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, there is considerable disagreement between the Parties as to whether the impairment in question was \"significant\" enough for a violation of the treaty standard or whether any negative impact on foreign investment, whatever its magnitude, is sufficient to constitute an actionable treaty violation. In the Tribunal's view, an impairment needs to be substantial in order to constitute a treaty breach. This proposition, however, need not be developed here, since, in the Tribunal's view, the determinative question is not whether the impairment was substantial, but whether the challenged measures were promulgated in pursuit of a rational policy and were implemented in a reasonable manner.\n\n684.\n\nThe Parties seem to agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that the relevant test to assess the rationality of a policy is that cogently articulated by the tribunal in *AES* as follows: \"A rational policy is taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.\"1021 In addition, the challenged measure must also be reasonable. As stipulated by the tribunal in *AES* in words with which the Tribunal is in full agreement, \"an appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it\" must exist.1022\n\n*AES*, para. 10.3.8 **(Ex. RLA-41)**.\n\n*AES*, para. 10.3.9 **(Ex. RLA-41)**.\n\n685.\n\nIn essence, the Respondent has argued that the amendments relating to taxation were motivated by the State's desire to safeguard the State budget in the midst of a global economic crisis. The Solar Levy was introduced, together with a State budget subsidy, to lower a perceived excessive burden caused by energy costs on consumers and to share it with what the Respondent considered (and considers) to be excessively profitable photovoltaic electricity producers.\n\n686.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that a \"balancing\" policy whereby electricity prices are lowered for the benefit of the general public and there is an equivalent diminution in excessive profits of PV investors, such that an excessive burden put on consumers might be alleviated, qualifies as a rational policy within the meaning of the above-referenced definition. Having carefully considered all the circumstances, the Tribunal finds the Respondent's explanation plausible. It concludes that the challenged measures were clearly aimed at addressing a public interest matter.\n\n687.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondent also acted in a reasonable manner when implementing the challenged measures. First, the Tribunal notes that it was expected that the FiT would be reduced by 30% in 2011 once the 5% break out rule was abolished. In this context, a Solar Levy for existing plants of 26% is certainly reasonable. More importantly, even after the Solar Levy reduced excessive profits, a reasonable return remained available for PV investors. In 2009, without the legislative amendments, the reference plant would have received a full payback in 9.5 years. Following the amendments, a payback could still be achieved in 11 years, and therefore well below the promised 15 years.1023 In 2010, without the legislative amendments, the reference plant would have received a full payback in 7.8 years. Following the amendments, a payback could still be achieved in 9.9 years, and therefore also well below the promised 15 years.1024 The return for the reference plant without amendments would have been 8.4% in 2009 and 11.4% in 2010, while the return with the amendments amounted to 7% in 2009 and 8.4% in 2010, and therefore exactly in line with or well above the promised 7% return rate.1025 In other words, despite the amendment measures, PV investments were as profitable \u2013 and in fact more profitable \u2013 than promised. Put shortly, the Solar Levy, contrary to the Claimant's argument, did not undermine the fundamental features of the Incentive Scheme. The Incentive Scheme guaranteed that eligible solar PV plants could expect a FiT that allowed a 15-year payback and a 7% rate of return over a period of 15 years. The Respondent did not breach these promises.\n\nFirst Peer Report, para. 4.8.1: the pay back for the Claimant would have been without amendments 6.6 years and was 8 years with amendments, *i.e*., also well below the promised 15 years.\n\nFirst Peer Report, para. 4.8.1: the pay back for the Claimant would have been without amendments 7.8 years and was 10.1 years with amendments, *i.e*., also well below the promised 15 years.\n\nFirst Peer Report, para. 4.8.3: The return for the Claimant would have been 14.4% without amendments and was 8% with amendments in 2009, and would have been 11.5% and was 8.2% in 2010, *i.e.*, also well above the promised 7% return rate. All measures together reduced the return for the 2009 reference plant from 8.4% to 7%, Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 230:8-18.\n\n688.\n\nIn this context, it is also worth noting that while the return for the reference plant decreased by 3%, electricity bills decreased by 3.6% for private households and 44.3% for medium industries. As a consequence, PV producers lost rather less, comparatively, than electricity consumers won.\n\n689.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that neither the introduction of the Solar Levy, nor the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives was unreasonable or arbitrary in the given circumstances. Whether, with the benefit of hindsight, there might have been a better way to address the problems caused by the rapid increase in the number of solar installations in the Czech Republic and the ensuing rise in electricity prices, is not a matter for the Tribunal to decide, but it is an issue that falls within a State's legislative discretion.\n\n690.\n\nHaving considered all materials and submissions before it, the Tribunal therefore concludes that the challenged measures did not impair the Claimant's investment in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n691.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its total costs amount to EUR 502,986.09, which includes the arbitration deposit of EUR 100,000.00 to date.1026\n\nClaimant's Updated Schedule of Costs, annexed to the Claimant's Supplemental Submission on Costs\n\n692.\n\nThe Claimant posits three different scenarios for the outcome of the arbitration, which would have an impact on the allocation of costs. According to the Claimant:\n\n(i) in the event that the Claimant prevails on the merits (**Scenario 1**), it should be awarded the costs of this arbitration, including the \"*costs of legal representation and assistance*\" pursuant to Article 38(e) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules;\n\n(ii) in the event that the Claimant prevails on jurisdiction, but not on the merits (**Scenario****2**), the Claimant should be awarded the costs of this arbitration, including the \"*costs of legal representation and assistance*\", relating to the Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction, but it should not bear any of the Respondent's costs relating to the merits, because the claim is a *bona fide* claim, raising complex issues, while the Respondent delayed and hindered the adjudication of the dispute; and\n\n(iii) in the event that the Respondent prevails on jurisdiction (**Scenario 3**), it is nonetheless reasonable that the Claimant should not bear any of the Respondent's costs (including the Respondent's costs for legal representation and assistance), because the claim is a *bona fide* claim, raising complex issues, while the Respondent delayed and hindered the adjudication of the dispute.1027\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 2.\n\n693.\n\nThe Claimant recalls that the principles with respect to the allocation of costs in the present arbitration are set out in Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.1028 As for the costs of the arbitration, Article 40(1) contains the general rule that \"costs follow the event\", pursuant to which a losing party bears the costs, but which also allows the arbitral tribunal to employ a different approach, taking into account \"the circumstance of the case\".1029 As for the costs of legal representation, Article 40(2) provides the tribunal a broader discretion to decide the allocation of the costs.1030\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 4.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 6.\n\n694.\n\nIn scenario 1, the Claimant submits that the Respondent should bear both the costs of arbitration and the costs of legal representation and assistance of the Claimant.1031 For the costs of arbitration, this follows from the \"costs follow the event\" rule.1032 As for the costs of legal representation, the Claimant alleges that an application of the \"cost follow the event\" rule would also be appropriate considering the circumstance of the case.1033 While the Claimant says that it submitted *bona fide* claims and adopted cost-effective approaches, the Respondent unnecessarily increased the Claimant's costs by refusing the adjudication of the claims in a single consolidated arbitration; provoking the EC's investigation of the Incentive Regime in relation to plants connected before 2013; and by including jurisdictional arguments in its Rejoinder submission in breach of the procedural timetable.1034 Moreover, since quantum constituted only a small portion of the entire arguments, whether the entirety, or only a portion, of the damages claimed were awarded would be irrelevant to the cost allocation.1035 In addition, the Claimant bore the burden of proof regarding several novel and complex issues for which no precedent existed.1036 The Respondent must also bear the costs of the *Achmea* phase, given that the jurisdictional objection was raised at a late stage in the proceedings.1037 Finally, the Respondent must bear the costs associated with the unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Beechey.1038\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 7.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 8.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 9-10.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 11-14.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 16-17.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 18-19.\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Submission on Costs, paras. 3, 6-7.\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Submission on Costs, paras. 8-10.\n\n695.\n\nIn scenario 2, the Claimant should be awarded its costs relating to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and should not bear the Respondent's costs on the merits.1039 The \"costs follow the event\" rule applies to both non-legal and legal costs as it does in scenario 1, as the Claimant would be the prevailing party on jurisdiction.1040 With regard to the merits, the Claimant submits that the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from the \"cost follows the event\" principle. For example, while the Claimant's claims were *bona fide*, the Respondent obstructed the proceeding by, *inter alia*, \"raising overly complex \u2013 but totally unhelpful \u2013 EU State Aid law defenses.\"1041\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 2.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 20.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 21.\n\n696.\n\nIn scenario 3, the Claimant submits that it should not bear any of the Respondent's costs.1042 The Claimant alleges that the \"costs follow the event\" rule should not be applied by the Tribunal, given the procedural behaviour of the Parties more fully described above.1043\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 2.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 23; Claimant's Supplemental Submission on Costs, paras. 3, 7.\n\n697.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its legal costs are reasonable pursuant to Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules.1044 The Claimant alleges that it \"ran the case with a small legal team, relied on expert evidence only where strictly necessary, and divided essentially all costs with the other nine claimants.\"1045 The Claimant adds that if the Respondent's legal costs exceed those of the Claimant, any excess amount would be unreasonable.1046\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 24.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 24.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 25.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n698.\n\nThe Respondent requests that should it prevail in the arbitration, the Tribunal order the Claimant to pay all of the Czech Republic's costs and expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding (including attorney fees and expenses), in the amount of USD 1,246,817, as well as the Czech Republic's share of the costs incurred by the Tribunal and the PCA, in the amount of EUR 100,000 to date.1047\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 1; Respondent's Updated Submission on Costs, paras. 1-3.\n\n699.\n\nThe Respondent has divided its costs and expenses equally among PCA Cases 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22, estimating \"that the share of costs devoted to each of these matters has been roughly equal.\"1048\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 2. *See also* Respondent's Updated Submission on Costs, para. 2.\n\n700.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the costs of the arbitration should be allocated on the basis of the \"loser pays\" or \"costs follow the event\" principle pursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Accordingly, the Tribunal should issue \"an award of reasonable costs in favour of the prevailing party\".1049 With respect to the costs of legal representation, the Respondent acknowledges that Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules \"confers on the Tribunal broad discretion to determine any reasonable apportionment of such costs in light of the circumstances of the case\".1050\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 3-4.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\n701.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the \"loser pays\" principle does not only apply to arbitration costs, but also to the costs of legal representation despite the difference in wording between Articles 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. It refers the Tribunal to the decision in *ECE Projektmanagement GmbH et al. v. The Czech Republic*, which ruled that \"the relevant criteria are in both cases essentially the same, and include in both cases the extent to which the successful party has succeeded on the principal question in issue in the dispute.\"1051 The Respondent further alleges that the application of the \"loser pays\" principle \"is not limited to the context of \u2018abusive' or \u2018frivolous' claims.\"1052\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 4-6, *referring to* *ECE Projektmanagement GmbH* et al. *v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-5, Award, 19 September 2013, para. 6.68.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 7.\n\n702.\n\nUnder the \"loser pays\" rule, a party may be considered the \"prevailing party\" if it \"has prevailed on all or only some of the issues in the case, *i.e.*, that party's \u2018relative success'\".1053 The concept of \"relative success\" should only be employed, however, if \"a tribunal has genuine difficulty in identifying the prevailing party.\"1054 Based on this understanding, the Respondent considers that it would be the \"prevailing party\", if it \"defeated all of the claims (whether on merits or jurisdiction)\".1055 In such case, so argues the Respondent, it \"should be awarded most or all of its reasonable costs\".1056\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 8.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 8.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 9.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 9.\n\n703.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that the Tribunal may depart from the \"loser pays\" principle in situations where a prevailing party \"caused an unnecessary aggravation of costs through its conduct in the proceedings (e.g. deficiencies in its presentation of the case or obstructive behavior)\".1057\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 17, *quoting* *Oxus Gold v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, Award, 17 December 2015, para. 1038. **(Ex. RLA-276)**.\n\n704.\n\nAgainst this background, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has caused such an \"unnecessary aggravation of costs\".1058 The Claimant, for example, (1) submitted \"massively overbroad document production requests\";1059 (2) disclosed funding sources of its investment in an untimely manner, creating a comparable situation to *Plama*, in which the Tribunal ordered the claimant to bear arbitration costs and the respondent's legal costs;1060 and (3) \"pursued a convoluted and ever-changing approach to the quantification of alleged damages\" and \"even submitted a highly unusual supplemental expert report\" which presented new arguments and required the Respondent to expend considerable resources in order to respond to it.1061\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 18.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 18(a).\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 18(b).\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 18(c).\n\n705.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that its costs are reasonable in amount, noting that its costs \"are as much as four times lower than the reported average costs of respondents in investment treaty disputes.\"1062\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 10, *referring to* Matthew Hodgson, Allen & Overy LLP, *Costs in Investment Treaty Arbitration: The Case for Reform*, p. 1. *See also* Respondent's Updated Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\n706.\n\nThe Respondent also states that the reasonableness of its costs is supported by the following four factors.1063 First, the Respondent employed a number of methods to increase cost efficiencies by \"coordinating its submissions\", engaging \"the same counsel team\", \"coordinating submission calendars and logistics with opposing counsel\" among the six cases originally brought by a single Notice of Arbitration, and \"agreeing to the same tribunal and joint hearing\" in PCA Cases 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22.1064 Second, the case at hand has presented \"a number of complex factual and legal issues\".1065 Third, the present case is \"of significant importance\" to the Czech Republic, given that \"it could face a wave of additional claims if the decision in this case were favourable to Claimant.\"1066 Fourth, the present proceedings have become lengthy because of a number of factors outside the Respondent's control, such as the EC's attempt to intervene and the Czech Republic's replacement of counsel due to the public procurement rules.1067 Lastly, the Respondent claims that even \"if [the Claimant] were to prevail on some or all of its claims\", the Claimant should be required to bear its costs.1068\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 11. *See also* Respondent's Updated Submission on Costs, paras. 9-10.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 12.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 13.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 14.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 15.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 17, 18, 19.\n\n707.\n\nIn respect of costs incurred in the context of the briefing on the *Achmea* judgment, the Respondent argues that such briefing was \"both necessary and entirely reasonable for the Czech Republic to request\" given that it was a \"landmark development\" and that \"the pursuit of EU law-based defenses [\u2026] is even mandated by the overarching duty of loyalty binding the Czech Republic vis-\u00e0-vis the EU and its Member States\".1069\n\nRespondent's Updated Submission on Costs, paras. 6-7.\n\n708.\n\nAs regards costs incurred in connection with the challenge to Mr. Beechey, the Respondent argues that it \"was based on very real concerns\", \"was not frivolous, vexatious, or dilatory\" and \"was pursued promptly and efficiently\".1070\n\nRespondent's Updated Submission on Costs, para. 8.\n\n709.\n\nFinally, the Respondent objects to the Claimant claiming reimbursement for \"IPVIC's internal costs\", as there \"is no reason for the Czech Republic to bear any share of the unspecified \u2018internal' costs incurred by a non-party to the proceedings.\"1071\n\nRespondent's Updated Submission on Costs, para. 11.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nThe Tribunal will first detail the arbitration costs and the costs for legal representation and assistance of the Parties. It will then determine the apportionment of such costs.\n\n**1. Costs**\n------------\n\n711.\n\nArticle 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award, providing a list of items that may be claimed as such costs. These items include the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the approved costs of witnesses and the reasonable costs for legal representation and assistance.\n\n712.\n\nThe Tribunal estimates that it has spent roughly equal amounts of time and effort on PCA Case Nos. 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22. It therefore considers it reasonable to divide its costs and expenses, as well as the costs and expenses of the PCA, equally among the four arbitrations as follows.\n\n713.\n\nThe fees of Mr. Gary Born, co-arbitrator until his resignation on 24 June 2018, amount to EUR 31,912.50 and his expenses amount to EUR 749.72.\n\n714.\n\nThe fees of Mr. John Beechey CBE, co-arbitrator, amount to EUR 5,250. Mr. Beechey did not have any expenses.\n\n715.\n\nThe fees of Mr. Toby Landau QC, co-arbitrator, amount to EUR 39,135.42 and his expenses amount to EUR 653.49.\n\n716.\n\nThe fees of Professor Hans van Houtte, presiding arbitrator, amount to EUR 64,442.50 and his expenses amount to EUR 121.50.\n\n717.\n\nThe costs of other tribunal expenses, including the costs of a court reporter, interpretation, technician, catering, printing and courier charges, and others total EUR 20,142.84.\n\n718.\n\nPCA fees amount to EUR 36,500. The PCA incurred no expenses.\n\n719.\n\nEach Party paid advances on costs in the amount of EUR 100,000, *i.e.*, a total advance of EUR 200,000.\n\n720.\n\nAs for the Parties' respective costs of legal representation and assistance, the Claimant's costs related to this arbitration amount to EUR 402,986.09. The Respondent's costs related to this arbitration amount to USD 1,246,817. Considering the complexity of this proceeding, the novel issues of fact and law that have arisen in its context, and the fact that the costs relate to four coordinated proceedings, both amounts appear reasonable.\n\n**2. Allocation of Costs**\n--------------------------\n\n721.\n\nAs correctly noted by both Parties, Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows with regard to the allocation of costs:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n**(a) The Costs of the Arbitration**\n------------------------------------\n\n722.\n\nAs both Parties have recognised, Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules affords the Tribunal broad discretion in matters of costs. Pursuant to Article 40(1), the unsuccessful party shall \"in principle\" bear the costs of arbitration. Where no party clearly prevails, a common method to allocate costs is to take account of the relative success of the claims and defenses. Another criterion that tribunals frequently consider is the general conduct of a party throughout the proceedings.\n\n723.\n\nAs a first consideration, as far as the Parties' success on their respective cases is concerned, the Claimant has prevailed on jurisdiction, whereas the Respondent has prevailed on the merits.\n\n724.\n\nAs a second consideration, as far as the Parties' conduct is concerned, the Tribunal considers that counsel on both sides conducted this arbitration fairly and with high professional standards. None of the facts that would clearly justify an adverse cost allocation, such as bad faith, abusive or unreasonable argument, obstructive or dilatory tactics etc., was present in this arbitration.\n\n725.\n\nAccordingly, in line with the presumption contained in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and in the exercise of its discretion in matters of costs, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent shall bear 25% and the Claimant shall bear 75% of the costs of arbitration.\n\n726.\n\nThe PCA shall therefore reimburse to the Respondent the unexpended balance of the deposit in the amount of EUR 1,092.03. The Claimant is requested to reimburse to the Respondent the amount of EUR 49,180.98 within six weeks of this Award.\n\n**(b) The Costs of Legal Representation and Assistance**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n727.\n\nArticle 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules does not contain a presumption in favour of awarding the costs of legal representation and assistance of the successful party. Instead, it provides that in apportioning the costs, the Tribunal shall take account of \"the circumstances of the case\".\n\n728.\n\nThe present arbitration was genuinely complex and raised difficult and novel issues of fact and law, the outcome of which was uncertain. In particular, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's claims, although ultimately unsuccessful, were reasonable.\n\n729.\n\nIn the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal therefore finds that in the circumstances of the present case, it is fair for each Party to bear its own legal fees, costs, and expenses in this arbitration, including fees, costs, and expenses related to expert and fact witnesses.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n---------------------------------\n\n730.\n\nBased on the considerations set out above, the Tribunal rules as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimant's claims are dismissed.\n\n(b) The Claimant shall pay to the Respondent within six weeks of the delivery of this Award the sum of EUR 49,180.98.\n\n(c) Each Party shall bear its own costs of legal representation and assistance.\n\n(d) All other claims are dismissed."}]}
