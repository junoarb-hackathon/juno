FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present decision deals with a Motion for a Summary Decision on the Admissibility of Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objection filed by Claimants Hassan Awdi (U.S.A.), Enterprise Business Consultants, Inc. (U.S.A.), and Alfa El Corporation (U.S.A.) on May 1, 2013 (the \"Motion\"). In order to place the Motion in the context of the Parties\u2019 dispute, it is convenient to summarize briefly the factual background of such dispute.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 investment in Romania mainly consists of a press distribution company called Rodipet S.A. (\"Rodipet,\" now \"Network Press Concept\"), which was state-owned before being privatized, and a historic property located in downtown Bucharest called Casa Bucur, which the Claimants transformed into a luxury boutique hotel and restaurant.1\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 17-18, 31.\n\n3.\n\nIn December 2003, the Authority for Privatization and Management of State Ownership (\"AVAS\") of Romania sold, by way of a Privatization Contract, 100 percent of Rodipet\u2019s share capital to the Romanian company Magnar System Com srl (\"Magnar\"). The transfer became effective on July 31, 2004. In February 2004, Mr. Awdi and members of his family acquired Magnar and, on April 25, 2007, Magnar\u2019s shares were transferred to the Romanian company Street Corner srl. The latter is wholly owned by Enterprise Business Consultants, Inc. (\"EBI\") which, in turn, is wholly owned by Mr. Awdi.2\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 19-22.\n\n4.\n\nUnder the Privatization Contract, Romania undertook to enact a law granting of a 49-year concession (with an option to extend) to Rodipet over land on which Rodipet\u2019s points of sale are located. This obligation was fulfilled when Ordinance 45/2004 of January 29, 2004 was issued and Law 442/2004 of October 28, 2004 was passed.3 Magnar undertook to invest 3.75 million Euros in Rodipet, to be paid in five yearly instalments. This obligation also was fulfilled.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 24, 29-30\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute between the parties arose when Law 442/2004, after being successfully challenged, was declared unconstitutional by the Romanian Constitutional Court on July 7 and 15, 2008.4 Subsequently, AVAS claimed that Magnar\u2019s fourth instalment payment under the Privatization Contract was not made validly. Thus, on June 30, 2009, AVAS registered a security pledge, that guaranteed Magnar\u2019s fulfilment of its commitments under the Privatization Contract, on a block of Rodipet shares. This gave AVAS control over 51% of Rodipet. On July 16, 2009, Romanian authorities announced the appointment of a provisional administrator for Rodipet.5\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 42.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 47, 49-50.\n\n6.\n\nRegarding Casa Bucur, the Claimants\u2019 other main investment, it used to be a privately owned piece of property that had been nationalized in 1950. After the 1989 revolution, Romania transferred its ownership to AV AS which, in turn, transferred it to Alfa El Bucur srl, a company indirectly owned by Mr. Awdi.6\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 32-34.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, however, the Romanian Supreme Court decided that Casa Bucur should be returned to its original owners. This decision, the Claimants contend, constitutes an expropriatory measure for which no compensation was paid.7\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 54\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants assert that they notified Romania of the existence of a dispute since 2008 and, subsequently, undertook various efforts to reach amicable settlement, as required under Article VI.3 of the BIT, but without success.8 Thus, on May 31, 2010, the Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\").\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 83-86.\n\n9.\n\nAccording to the Request for Arbitration, Romania breached the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Romania concerning the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investment dated May 28, 1992 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\"), which entered into force on January 15,1994.\n\n10.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants contend, Romania breached Article II.2.a on fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security; Article II.3 relating to the entry and sojourn of aliens, nationals of either Party into the territory of the other Party; Article Il.2.b on the prohibition against unreasonable or discriminatory measures; Article III.l on expropriation guarantees; Article II.2.c on the observance of obligations; and Article II.7 on making public any measures that pertain to or affect investments.\n\n11.\n\nClaimants request compensation for all damages suffered as a consequence of these breaches, including moral damages, loss of profits, arbitration costs, interest, plus any further relief deemed appropriate by the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration was registered on June 16, 2010. The Tribunal was constituted on January 19, 2011, and held its first session on March 10, 2011 in Paris, France. The Tribunal issued the Minutes of the First Session on April 8, 2011. Item 13 of the Minutes provisionally set out the schedule of pleadings. By agreement of the parties, as approved by the Tribunal, the schedule was subsequently modified on June 27, 2012, and extended on October 12, 2012. Under the extended schedule, the Claimants filed their Memorial on October 20, 2012.\n\n13.\n\nOn February 11, 2013, the parties agreed a further modification of the procedural calendar under which the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on March 15, 2013.\n\n14.\n\nUnder cover of letter of May 1, 2013, the Claimants filed their Motion along, *inter alia,* the witness statements of Ms. Ana Galenic, Ms. Georgeta Popescu, Ms. Aurelia Turea, Mr. Florin Lungoci and Mr. Shem Orina. The Motion is directed to the Respondent\u2019s contention in the Counter-Memorial of March 15, 2013 (the \"Counter-Memorial\") that the Claimants\u2019 actions were not in good faith and that their claims are inadmissible (at paras. 425 *et seq.)* Accompanying the Motion is a request for a modification of the procedural calendar of February 11, 2013.\n\n15.\n\nAccording to the Motion, the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objection is based \"on alleged facts and information that are all subjected to ongoing criminal investigations or proceedings in Romania,\" namely the Claimants\u2019 criminal actions such as *\u2018\"human trafficking,\" ''looting of Rodipet\u2019s assets and business,\" \"crimes of running a criminal organization, embezzlement, tax evasion and money laundering.\"*\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants have requested the Tribunal to decide the Motion as a matter of urgency and on a preliminary basis, before they answer to the merits of the Respondent\u2019s accusation, and to rule that the Respondent\u2019s objection is inadmissible.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of May 3, 2013, the Respondent replied by contending that there is no procedural basis for the Tribunal to deal with the Motion, the Claimants\u2019 allegation that responding to the Respondent\u2019s arguments is costly and time consuming being hardly a ground for departing from the agreed procedural timetable. According to the Respondent, the Motion should be rejected as unfounded.\n\n18.\n\nShould the Tribunal be minded to accede to the Claimants\u2019 request, in the Respondent\u2019s view an appropriate pleading schedule should be set out or the proceedings be bifurcated to deal initially with all of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional and admissibility objections, suspending the proceedings on the merits.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of May 8, 2013, the Claimants contended that they were forced to bring the Motion due to the Respondent reneging on its representations that the arbitration would not be about the existence of a criminal liability by Mr. Hassan Awdi, that delaying a decision on the Motion would go against the principle of procedural economy and that the Tribunal is empowered under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 19 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to decide on any questions of procedure.\n\n20.\n\nBy communication of May 10, 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties of the decision to admit the Motion and the invitation to try to agree on a revised calendar for the entire proceedings by May 15, 2013 or, in case of failure to agree, on a calendar limited to the Motion, including a hearing, by May 24, 2013.\n\n21.\n\nHaving failed to agree on the revised schedule for the proceedings by the date of May 15, 2013, the Parties informed the Tribunal on May 22, 2013 of their respective positions regarding the procedural calendar limited to the Motion. Based on the Parties\u2019 positions, on May 24, 2013 the Tribunal fixed the calendar as follows:\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply June 17, 2013\n\nParties\u2019 election of witnesses to be heard July 1, 2013\n\nHearing July 9-10, 2013\n\nTribunal\u2019s expected decision end of July 2013\n\n22.\n\nUnder cover of letter of June 17, 2013, the Respondent submitted its Reply (the \"Reply\"), as provided by the procedural calendar.\n\n23.\n\nBy communication of July 1, 2013, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that none of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses should be heard at the hearing of July 9-10, 2013, reserving to hear them at the hearing on the merits scheduled for October 2013.\n\n24.\n\nFollowing the Parties\u2019 disagreement on the schedule for the hearing on the Motion, except for the fact that one day would be sufficient, the Tribunal fixed the schedule.\n\n25.\n\nPrior to the hearing, each Party submitted additional documents with the other Party\u2019s consent.\n\n26.\n\nThe hearing on the Motion took place on July 9, 2013, at the World Bank European Headquarters in Paris, France. The following persons attended the hearing in addition to the members of the Tribunal:\n\nFor the Claimants:\n\n- Hassan Awdi Claimant   \n- Dany Khayat Mayer Brown   \n- Jos\u00e9 Caicedo Mayer Brown   \n- Joy Kreidi Mayer Brown   \n- William Ahern Mayer Brown   \n- Ra\u00ebd Fadhallah Bredin Prat   \n- Hollis Dufour Bredin Prat   \n- Liliane Djahangir Bredin Prat   \n- Violeta Oancea Mr. Hassan Awdi\u2019s local counsel   \n- Adrian Bendeac Mr. Hassan Awdi\u2019s local counsel   \n- Andrei Oancea Mr. Hassan Awdi\u2019s local counsel\n\nFor the Respondent:\n\n- Mr. Veijo Heiskanen Lalive   \n- Mr. Matthias Scherer Lalive   \n- Ms. Laura Halonen Lalive   \n- Ms. Crenguta Leaua Leaua & Asociatii   \n- Mr. Marius Grigorescu Leaua & Asociatii   \n- Mr. Stefan Dudas Leaua & Asociatii\n\n27.\n\nThe hearing transcript was made available to the Tribunal and the Parties soon after the hearing.\n\nII. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS\n-------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nWhat follows is a summary of what each Party has pleaded both in writing and at the July 9, 2013 hearing, the Tribunal having fully considered the respective argument and supporting evidence to reach its decision.\n\nA. The Claimants\u2019 position\n--------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in order to deny their claims, the Respondent is attempting to rely on facts and information subject to on-going criminal investigations, thus importing into this arbitration these investigations and proceedings in violation of Mr. Awdi\u2019s most basic rights, including the right to the presumption of innocence, the right to remain silent and the right to a fair trial.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is contrary to what it emphatically stated in its Response to the Request for Provisional Measures of January 28, 2011, namely that *\"This arbitration is not about the existence or not of criminal liability by Mr Hassan Awdi or his associates and the investigated persons have the right to the presumption of innocence in the ongoing criminal investigation.\"*\n\n31.\n\nHowever, in the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 claims are inadmissible because they *\"are trying to benefit from their own illegality and unconscionable conduct,\"* namely criminal actions. Under international law, the Respondent is estopped from contesting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide the Claimants\u2019 claims based on said criminal actions.\n\n32.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the Respondent\u2019s objection is in breach of the international obligation to accord Mr. Awdi the presumption of innocence and a fair trial and is therefore inadmissible considering also the extensive, costly and complicated analysis required by the criminal issues that the Respondent attempts to introduce into this arbitration.\n\n33.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to decide that its criminal accusations against Mr. Awdi are not only justified but that they should also prevent to hear their claims since the Claimants\u2019 investments were \"illegal\" and made in \"bad faith\" based on criminal accusations. The Respondent is estopped from contesting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction since the Claimants relied in good faith upon its statement during the Provisional Measures phase that *\"there is no overlap between the subject-matter of the ICSID arbitration and the ongoing criminal investigations\"* and on its subsequent representations, the Claimants having suffered a detriment by such reliance since they are expected to conduct a *defacto* criminal defense without access to all the relevant evidence.\n\n34.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the presumption of innocence applies to the Respondent\u2019s objection since the latter considers Mr. Awdi guilty from the time it filed its objection on jurisdiction on 15 March 2013, otherwise such objection would have no basis. The Respondent is expecting the Tribunal to rule upon the criminal matters now pending before the Romanian courts. In the Claimants\u2019 view, the presumption of innocence extends to subsequent or parallel proceedings, such as this arbitration, as held by the European Court of Human Rights (\"ECtHR\").\n\n35.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 position that a Tribunal\u2019s decision to stay the arbitration pending a final decision by the Romanian courts regarding Mr. Awdi\u2019s criminal guilt would be inconsistent with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and, more generally, with international law, ICSID tribunals having emphasized that they are not bound by the judicial tribunals of the host State in criminal matters.\n\n36.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, if, as argued by the Respondent, the Treaty and the ICSID Convention entitle them to rely on an objection to admissibility of the claims in breach of the presumption of innocence, that would be contrary to a peremptory norm of international law. The only reasonable interpretation guaranteeing the validity of the Treaty is holding that the Respondent\u2019s objection based on the violation of Mr. Awdi\u2019s presumption of innocence is inadmissible.\n\n37.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the presumption of innocence can only be lifted if a fair trial is possible. Since due to the Respondent\u2019s tactics of transforming this arbitration into a *de facto* criminal hearing this is impossible, the Tribunal should refrain from deciding the Respondent\u2019s objection.\n\n38.\n\nSome key aspects of the criminal proceedings reveal in the Claimants\u2019 view the Respondent\u2019s *mala fide* procedural conduct. Thus, the cr im inal investigations were initiated and conducted by policemen having a financial dispute with Rodipet, as shown by cases dealing with the franchise program adopted by Rodipet in which a policeman named Ivanovic and the wife of another policeman, Ms. Margineau, were involved. In reality, they were only nominees of a group of policemen having business relations with Rodipet. These relations having worsened, Mr. Invanovic\u2019s colleagues began investigating Mr. Awdi\u2019s companies in January 2008 playing a key role in the criminal investigation regarding the Honduras nationals and this despite the conflict of interest would have forbidden their involvement according to the law.\n\n39.\n\nFurther, according to the Claimants, the criminal investigations in the CFR-Mesagerie case and the Rodipet case were prosecuted by the mother of a former employee of Rodipet, Prosecutor Giorgiana Hosu. It was the latter\u2019s husband, Mr. Dan Hosu, in charge of the illegal immigration special unit, who revealed the alleged human trafficking of forced labour and who should have disclosed the existence of a conflict of interest in a case in which his wife was prosecutor. As recalled by the Claimants, Prosecutor Hosu\u2019s decisions in this case (File 39O/D/O/2OO6) are at the heart of their claim against the Respondent for breach of the full protection and security clause of the US-Romania BIT.\n\n40.\n\nStill according to the Claimants, there are strong indications that the criminal accusations regarding the alleged human trafficking (File 304/D/P/2008) were fabricated, the Honduras\u2019 statements being fictitious and the evidence being plainly absent. The 31 October 2008 inspection during which the Hondurans were found and liberated by the labour police was a set-up organized to prepare accusations regarding human trafficking. Hard evidence from DIICOT\u2019s file 304/D/P/2008 proves that the Hondurans lied in their statements, several among them having refrained from following their colleagues in making false accusation.\n\n41.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 position that since the legality of the testimonial evidence on which the accusation of human trafficking for forced labour as well as the independence of the prosecutor in charge of the CFR-Mesagerie and the Rodipet criminal investigations are contested before Romanian courts, the Tribunal cannot admit such evidence.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the presumption of innocence includes the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to silence and the right not to disclose the nature of one\u2019s defence before trial. Should the Tribunal hold the Respondent\u2019s objection admissible in these proceedings, the Claimants would have to disclose their criminal defense and the Tribunal would, unwittingly, assist the Respondent in violating Mr. Awdi\u2019s rights, the Respondent\u2019s counsel in this arbitration and AVAS9 being closely cooperating with the Romanian prosecutors.\n\nAVAS is the entity in charge of the present arbitration on behalf of the Respondent..\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent has failed to allow Mr. Awdi to face his accusers and cross-examine the witnesses on those testimony the criminal accusations rely and has failed to produce as witnesses the Honduran \"victims\" and Mr. Vasile Uifalean who drafted two reports on the financial status of Rodipet, which were transmitted to the prosecutors together with Rodipet\u2019s files. Mr. Uifalean\u2019s failure to appear before the Tribunal results in his evidence becoming inadmissible.\n\n44.\n\nAs the Respondent has not met its international obligations regarding the presumption of innocence, the Tribunal shall according to international law refrain from deciding the Respondent\u2019s objection or, at least, remove from the file all evidence on which it relies to prove the alleged \"illegalities\" and \"bad faith\".\n\n45.\n\nThe following summary decision is requested by the Claimants under the Motion (at para. 161):\n\n\"(a) Declaring that the Respondent\u2019s Objection to the admissibility of the claims is inadmissible.\n\n(b) Ordering the Respondent to produce evidence of the following concerning the subsidiary request to reconsider the stay of the criminal proceedings:\n\n\u2022 Disclosure by Respondent\u2019s police officers having conflicts of interest due to financial relations with Rodipet to those officer\u2019s appropriate superiors and measures taken by such superiors;\n\n\u2022 Disclosure by Prosecutor Hosu of her son\u2019s professional relationship with Rodipet (including unethical behavior leading to his dismissal) to appropriate professional board and such board\u2019s subsequent finding;\n\n\u2022 Prosecutor Hosu\u2019s annual affidativ recorded and submitted to her professional file setting out Mr. Dan Hosu\u2019s role in charge of the illegal immigration special police unit *Serviciului de Combatere a Migrafiei lleg\u00f3le din cadrul Direc(iei de Combatere a Criminalit\u00e2tii Organ\u00edzate* including all details of his role in cases involving the Claimants in which she is prosecutor.\"\n\n46.\n\nAt the hearing, following a request for clarification by the President of the Tribunal, the Claimants have stated that the request under (b) of para. 161 \"is moot\" (transcript, page 158, lines 1-5 and 6).\n\nB. The Respondent\u2019s position\n----------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent contends initially that, as a rule, preliminary objections that are linked to the merits are joined to the merits so as not to prejudge the latter. The links between the Motion and the merits are obvious since in order to defend itself the Respondent has to rely on facts and information subject to on-going criminal investigations or proceedings. As a matter of fact, one of the Claimants\u2019 claims arise directly out of the criminal investigations, the Claimants alleging that the Respondent has \"breached the Treaty by abusively prosecuting the Claimants and its managers for fictitious criminal actions\".\n\n48.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants are trying to use the criminal proceedings to interfere with the Respondent\u2019s rights in this arbitration and, *vice versa,* to use this arbitration as an argument in the criminal proceedings. The Claimants have not explained why they are at a procedural disadvantage considering that neither the Respondent\u2019s counsel nor AVAS have access to confidential criminal files while the Claimants have been given the opportunity to review evidence held by DIICOT during the document access process. If the Claimants were indeed concerned about the possible impact on this arbitration of the on-going criminal proceedings they might ask for the suspension of this arbitration.\n\n49.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Motion should be rejected, with full costs awarded, to avoid that the Claimants use these proceedings to deny the Respondent\u2019s fundamental due process rights and in order to deter such conduct by the Claimants in the future.\n\n50.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the Motion misrepresents the Respondent\u2019s inadmissibility objections. The latter have regard to the lack of good faith by the Claimants\u2019 actions in their dealing with Romania, such actions having undermined internationally recognized labour rights and the well-being of Rodipet\u2019s employees. As a result of their actions, the Claimants have foregone the protections under the BIT.\n\n51.\n\nAs recognized by several previous ICSID tribunals, including in the *Plama v. Bulgaria* case of 2008, States cannot be deemed to offer access to ICSID arbitration to investments not made in good faith, good faith being one of the principles of international law. As held by the ICSID award in *Inceysa Vallisoletana v. El Salvador* of 2006, no legal system allows the party that committed a chain of clearly illegal acts to benefit from them.\n\n52.\n\nAs a further admissibility requirement, the Respondent refers to the worker rights mentioned in the preamble to the BIT, to be considered a guiding principle of the BIT protections and investments to which such protections are available. Investors that grossly abuse internationally recognized worker rights and undermine the well-being of workers should not be entitled to the BIT substantive protections. The Respondent recalls that the requirement for the workers\u2019 well-being was specifically agreed upon in the Privatisation Contract and the Protocol entered into with trade unions and, further, that Romania is party to international conventions prohibiting forced labour and punishing the trafficking of persons.\n\n53.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s position that since the Claimants\u2019 actions have undermined internationally recognized labour rights and the well-being of Rodipet\u2019s employees, as detailed in the Counter-Memorial, the Claimants have foregone the protections under the BIT and their claims must be dismissed. First of all, the Claimants did not provide the host State with relevant and material information concerning the investor and the investment, their *modus operandi* being to find cash rich companies and strip them off their assets. Secondly, there was never any intention by the Claimants to fulfil the obligations under the Privatisation Contract regarding Rodipet, specifically to invest and to maintain Rodipet\u2019s employees, the aim being to loot and exploit.\n\n54.\n\nThirdly, according to the Respondent, in addition to financially mismanaging Rodipet, the Claimants\u2019 actions, starting in 2008, adopted a reprehensible scheme to lure unsuspected Hondurans to Romania to be used as forced labour in Rodipet\u2019s kiosks to the expense of Rodipet\u2019s employees.\n\n55.\n\nRegarding the interplay between this arbitration and the criminal proceedings, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 contention the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objection is made at the level of jurisdiction and applicable law within the jurisdiction of an international tribunal established under the BIT. This is different from the criminal investigations and prosecutions in which Mr. Hassan Awdi is involved, which are governed by the Romanian criminal law and fall within the jurisdiction of Romanian courts.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that there may be a factual overlap between the two proceedings but contends that the same fact shall give rise to independent legal consequences depending on the applicable law and the competent jurisdiction. This has a specific reference to Mr. Awdi\u2019s conduct in his dealing with Rodipet and the Honduran employees. There is nothing unusual in criminal proceedings and investment arbitration being conducted in parallel, as shown by a number of ICSID arbitrations, including those involving Romania.\n\n57.\n\nRegarding the Claimants\u2019 specific allegations, they are in any event unfounded according to the Respondent. The presumption of innocence invoked by the Claimants applies to criminal proceedings only, the ECtHR holding that no violation of the presumption of innocence is found \"if the findings of administrative bodies had no influence or prejudicial effect on the criminal investigation\"10. In this arbitration, the Respondent has not alleged that Mr. Hassan Awdi has met the test for being guilty of a crime under Romanian law.\n\n*Sikic* v. *Croatia,* Reply, para. 44 and fn. 68.\n\n58.\n\nThe conspiracy theory advanced by the Claimants rests on unfounded allegations. Mr. Vlad Hosu, who is not the son of Prosecutor Giorgiana Hosu but the son of her husband Mr. Dan Hosu, resigned from Rodipet after three months, leaving no debts to the company, to become an attorney of good standing at the Bucharest Bar. There was no conflict interest regarding Prosecutor Hosu, not one that would come under Article 70 of Law 161/2003 referred to by the Claimants.\n\n59.\n\nNo policemen involved in the investigations into the Awdi Group had any financial interest in it, according to the Respondent. The Claimants have misrepresented the relationship between Mr. Ivanovic and Rotmar, Rotmar and Rodipet as well as Mr. Ivanovic and the investigating officers. Mr. Ivanovic, who worked at the IGPR, was not a colleagues of the officers that began investigating human trafficking in 2008, the latter belonging to the IGPF, a different department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs entirely independent of the IGPR.\n\n60.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, there was nothing out of the ordinary in the initiation of the human trafficking case which began when the Honduran workers complained to the IGPF on 17 October 2008, followed by the latter\u2019s inspection on 31 October 2008 at Rodipet kiosks where they were working. As foreseen by Romanian law, medical, legal and social assistance as well as repatriation was provided to the Honduran workers. The latter presented claims against Mr. Hassan Awdi and his assistant Alex Sweis as civil parties in the criminal proceedings. On 8 May 2013 the first instance court enacted a verdict of not guilty which was appealed by the prosecution.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that there is no violation of Mr. Awdi\u2019s right to silence since there is no question of deciding criminal guilt or innocence in this arbitration. The criminal defence of Mr. Awdi does not come into play since he has to demonstrate that the Claimants acted in good faith, were not trying to benefit from their wrongdoing and their investments contributed to the well-being of workers and promote respect for internationally recognized worker rights, as foreseen by the BIT preamble.\n\n62.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, there is no violation of Mr. Awdi\u2019s right to face his accusers and cross-examine witnesses on whose testimony the criminal accusation rely. The ICSID Rule 41(1) provides that the Tribunal is the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value. The Claimants shall have the opportunity of cross-examining the five witnesses of fact proposed by the Respondent at the October 2013 hearing, the rest of the evidence being documentary.\n\n63.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the witness statements in the human trafficking case are not witness statements produced in this arbitration since they were not prepared for these proceedings but only for the purposes of the criminal proceedings. The same apply to the various reports prepared by the special administrator of Rodipet which are submitted in these proceedings as evidence of his analysis of the actions taken by the Awdi Group when they were running Rodipet. The Claimants may test Mr. Florea, the special administrator of Rodipet, who filed a witness statement in this arbitration. The Claimants have the right to examine the prosecution witnesses in the criminal proceedings, this being the right forum for it.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent denies the Claimants\u2019 request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to produce evidence based on the reservation made by the Tribunal in the Decision on Provisional Measures (at para. 75). Such reservation was in fact limited to the specific question whether the amount of damages to the Romanian State for tax evaded would have had an impact on the amount of damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants, which is not the present case.\n\n65.\n\nIn conclusion, in the Reply (at para. 101) the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n\" a. Dismiss the Motion in its entirety;\n\nb. Confirm the timetable agreed between the Parties, including directing the Claimants to file their reply to the inadmissibility objection within two weeks of the Tribunal\u2019s decision; and\n\nc. Order, with prejudice to the further proceedings, that the Claimants have to bear all the costs of these ancillary pleadings on the Motion including but not limited to all costs and fees of the Tribunal and ICSID and that it has to pay to the Respondent the costs it has incurred for its defence, including the fees and disbursement for its attorney and the disbursement for its witnesses, to be quantified\".\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n---------------\n\n66.\n\nThe problem raised by the Motion and discussed between the Parties in their written submissions and at the oral hearing is of relevance for the development of investment treaty arbitration. It concerns the interplay between, on the one hand, the sovereign power of the host State to investigate and prosecute by its own courts according to its domestic law criminal acts committed in its territory and, on the other hand, the autonomy from such criminal investigations and proceedings of the investment arbitration conducted under an international treaty by a tribunal appointed and acting according to the provisions of such treaty.\n\n67.\n\nThis is particularly so when, as in the present case, the proceeding is conducted under the ICSID Convention which provides for the exclusivity of the chosen method of dispute resolution. The Convention states in Article 26 that \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\"\n\n68.\n\nThe Motion specifically regards the Respondent\u2019s third objection under the CounterMemorial (paras. 425 *et seq.)* that the \"Claimants\u2019 actions were not in good faith and their claims and [are] inadmissible\" (para. 1). The Counter-Memorial refers in this regard to the facts that are considered in detail in Section Il.C.iii, consisting in the alleged looting and mismanagement of Rodipet (paras. 148-194), including dismissal of Rodipet\u2019s employees and human trafficking of Hondurans nationals to replace them (paras. 195-212).\n\n69.\n\nIn order to prove these facts the Respondent relies on evidence consisting of:\n\na. as to the looting and mismanagement of Rodipet: the witness statement of Mr. Cornel Florea, Rodipet\u2019s judicial administrator; Reports by Mr. Vasili Uifelean, Rodipet\u2019s special administrator; Report by Consulta 99 SPRL to the Bucharest Tribunal-7th Commercial Section; various documentary evidence; criminal proceedings, specifically the investigation by DIICOT in File No. 390/D/P/2006 dated October 23, 200611 and the indictment by DIICOT in File No. 38/D/P/ 2011 dated December 20, 201212;\n\nb. as to the human trafficking of Hondurans nationals, in addition to part of the evidence under a) above, statements by some of the Hondurans workers and the indictment by DIICOT in File No. 304/D/P/2008 dated April 24, 2012.13\n\nCPM-8 (Counter-Memorial, paras. 230-239).\n\nR-102 (Counter-Memorial paraas. 220-229).\n\nR-172 (Counter-Memorial, paras. 240-254).\n\n70.\n\nEvidence relied upon by the Respondent14 may be freely tested by the Claimants. The latter may call on their own motion or, if needed, with the Tribunal\u2019s assistance, each person having signed witness statements or expert reports to appear at the October 2013 hearing to be cross-examined, regardless of whether the statements or reports were prepared for the purpose of this arbitration if not subject to confidentiality under the criminal proceedings. They may likewise dispute any part of the documentary evidence proffered by the Respondent. The Claimants\u2019 right to challenge evidence is a sufficient reason for the dismissal of the Motion since the latter requests that the entirety of the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objection be declared inadmissible even when that objection is founded on evidence unrelated to or not emanating from criminal proceedings.\n\nThe fact that the Respondent may rely on other evidence not specifically mentioned in para. 56 of the text does not change the Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion.\n\n71.\n\nAs regards evidence from on-going criminal proceedings and involving Mr. Hassan Awdi, the Tribunal, having carefully considered the arguments submitted by both Parties, recalls the following. As mentioned by the Motion, during the Provisional Measures phase the Respondent has repeatedly represented that the criminal proceedings against Mr. Awdi do not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, so that the Respondent would now be estopped from relying on such proceedings as evidence of the illegality and lack of good faith of Mr. Awdi\u2019s actions. Among such statements by the Respondent, the Motion notes the following.\n\n72.\n\nIn the Response on Provisional Measures, the Respondent stated: *\"This arbitration is not about the existence or not of criminal liability by Mr. Hassan Awdi or his associates and the investigated persons have the right to the presumption of innocence in the on-going investigation in Romania.\"*\n\nIn the Rejoinder on Provisional Measures, the Respondent has further asserted:\n\n*It is clear from the evidence that the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings is not affected in any way by the pending criminal investigations [...] there is no overlap between the subject matter of the ICSID arbitration and the ongoing criminal investigations.*\n\nAt the hearing of March 10, 2011, the Respondent added: \u2018\n\n*Whatever the outcome of the criminal investigations, and the possible legal proceedings, an acquittal or a conviction, this will not affect in any way this Tribunal\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to determine the treaty claims.* *These two proceedings may be conducted in parallel.*\n\n73.\n\nIn order to reject the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Respondent is estopped from contesting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide the Claimants\u2019 claims the Respondent points to the different level of jurisdiction and applicable law characterizing investment arbitration as opposed to criminal proceedings.\n\n74.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 inadmissibility objection is made under international law and transnational public policy and falls within the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal established under the Treaty. By contrast, the criminal proceedings determining whether Mr. Awdi\u2019s (and his co-defendants\u2019) guilt or innocence are governed by domestic Romanian law and fall within the jurisdiction of domestic Romanian courts (Reply, para. 34). Therefore, even if there may be a factual overlap between the two proceedings, depending on the applicable law and jurisdiction the legal consequences of the same fact are independent, the subject-matter of the two proceedings being different.\n\n75.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, given the Respondent\u2019s objection to their claims, the context is no longer the same, the subject-matter of the criminal proceedings having to be compared with the subject-matter of the said objection (hearing transcript, p. 30, lines 2425; p. 31, lines 1-5). Thus, the subject-matter of the Rodipet criminal proceedings is whether the transactions involving Rodipet and other companies of the Awdi group were concluded by the Claimants with the intention to loot or embezzle Rodipet, which is precisely the subject-matter on the basis of which the Respondent claims in Section Il.C.iii of the Counter-Memorial that the Claimants\u2019 actions and investments were illegal and not in good faith (hearing transcript, p. 32, lines 5-25).\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that proceedings arising under Romanian domestic criminal law and the one brought by the Claimants under the Treaty are different. Even if there may be factual overlaps between the two proceedings, the respective causes of action are different, namely criminal offences under the criminal proceedings and breach of the Treaty under this arbitration.15 For the same reason, in the Tribunal\u2019s view the Claimants\u2019 reliance on estoppel to dispute the Respondent\u2019s objection is unwarranted.\n\nThe importance of the different cause of action, although in a different context, was affirmed by the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina* in order to distinguish between a treaty dispute and a contract dispute: \"A treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause of action\" (Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, para. 113).\n\n77.\n\nThe idea that criminal proceedings and investment arbitration may be conducted in parallel is emphasized by the Respondent in the Reply by reference to a number of ICSID cases, some of them involving Romania, illustrating how this interplay has manifested itself \"without any allegations such as those in the Motion being brought forward\" (para. 36). The examination of those cases reveals that in none of them the tribunal relied on evidence from ongoing criminal proceedings against the claimant to reach its decision in the arbitration proceeding. In some of these cases reference to criminal investigations or proceedings was meant to establish whether there was a breach of the relevant BIT due to the manner by which such proceedings were conducted. Thus, in one case the tribunal, having analyzed such conduct, concludes as follows.\n\n*The Parties are in agreement (see paragraph 233 above) that it is not for this Tribunal to determine whether or not there was a substantial basis for the criminal charges against Mr. Patriciu and his associates. For present purposes, it is enough to record the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that there is no evidence to show that the initiation of the criminal investigation and the indictment in and of themselves breached the standard of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The nature of the indictment does not, on its face, bear out any argument that it embodies a trumped-up set of criminal allegations that are accordingly only explicable as stemming from bias or improper motive.16*\n\n*Rompetrol* v. *Romania,* Award, May 6, 2013, para. 237. The same applies in another case referred to by the Respondent, *Spyridon Roussalis* v. *Romania,* Award, 7 December 2011: \"In conclusion, the Tribunal notes that Romanian courts and administrative procedures have been open to Claimant at all relevant times, Claimant has been successful in his efforts to have the first decision overturned and he had the opportunity to have the case heard on remand. Consequently, there appears to have been no denial of due process or denial of justice that would rise to the level of a violation of international law\" (para. 513). In another case, *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A.* v. *Republic of Turkey,* Award, 7 September 2009, the tribunal merely draws from the conclusion reached in other legal proceedings comfort for concluding as it had already concluded (para. 148).\n\n78.\n\nOther cases referred to by the Respondent deal with provisional measures requested by claimant as a protection against criminal proceedings by preserving such rights as the right to the non-aggravation of the dispute, to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings and to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings.17 The Tribunal notes that questions of the same nature have already been examined during the Provisional Measures phase of this arbitration and that the Decision of March 29, 2011 under Procedural Order No. 1 has been issued in that regard. The content of that Decision is confirmed in the light also of the subsequent developments of this case.\n\n*Quiborax* v. *Bolivia,* Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, para. 46; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* Procedural Order No. 3, 18 January 2005, paras 12-13; *Libananco v. Turkey,* Preliminary Issues, 23 June 2008, Sect. VII.3.\n\n79.\n\nThe present case finds therefore no useful precedent in other investment treaty cases to the extent the Tribunal is invited by the Respondent to consider the evidence relating to or emanating from ongoing criminal proceedings in order to draw its conclusion regarding issues to be decided in this arbitration. Thus, in the Counter-Memorial it is stated: \"The Tribunal is invited to read the indictment in its entirety for an overview of the scheme. In addition, the Respondent is providing a selection of the affidavits of the victims, as well as other evidence on the file with DIICOT, in Exhibits R-173 to R-198\"(para. 204). The Reply states: \"The present Tribunal is thus free to consider for itself the evidence relating to or emanating from the CFR-Mesagerie and human trafficking prosecution as well as the Rodipet investigation... to the extent is on the record of this arbitration... in order to draw its own conclusion\" (para. 97).\n\n80.\n\nThe Motion makes repeated references to the presumption of innocence to which Mr. Hassan Awdi is entitled as a reason to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objection. The Tribunal recalls that the presumption of innocence is provided by Article 6.2 of the Human Rights Convention as follows: *\"Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\"* The presumption of innocence is a rule of public international law under a number of international treaties to which also Romania is a party and has been applied by international tribunals. As stated by the ECtHR, *the presumption of innocence considered in the light of the general obligation of a fair criminal trial under Article 6.2* [of the Human Rights Convention] *excludes a finding of guilt outside the criminal proceedings before the competent trial court, irrespective or the procedural safeguards in such parallel proceedings and notwithstanding general consideration of expediency)18*\n\nCase of *B\u00f4hmer* v. *Germany,* referred to by the Motion (para. 49, end of first bullet point).\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal reaffirms in that regard that like any other international tribunals it is endowed with the inherent power and corresponding duty to preserve the integrity of the arbitral process. As expressed by another tribunal, the principle implies that:\n\n*parties have an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith and that an arbitral tribunal has the inherent jurisdiction to ensure that this obligation is complied with; this principle applies in all arbitration, including investment arbitration, and to all parties, including States (even in the exercise of their sovereign powers')19*\n\n*Libananco v. Turkey,* Decision on Preliminary Issues, 23 June 2008, para. 78.\n\n82.\n\nIt is worth recalling in this context that already in its Decision on Provisional Measures under Procedural Order No. 1 the Tribunal has confirmed that the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings gives it the \"exclusive power to rule upon the legal issues brought before it\" and that \"an ICSID tribunal has to ensure that its exclusive jurisdiction is not, in law or in fact, impaired or undermined by the criminal proceedings conducted in the host State\" (Decision, para. 74). Precisely in view of the different cause of action of this arbitration (expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 investments in Rodipet and Casa Bucur and payment of compensation for the breach of the BIT), the Tribunal already concluded that \"the pending criminal proceedings against Mr. Awdi will not prevent the decision of legal issues brought before it\" (*ibid.,* para. 75).\n\n83.\n\nRegarding evidence related to criminal proceedings that the Respondent invites the Tribunal to consider,20 what matters for the issue before the Tribunal is not that the facts and information relied upon by the Respondent for its admissibility objection are all subjected to the on-going investigations or criminal proceedings in Romania, as contended by the Motion (para. 2). What matters is the Claimants\u2019 right to challenge in this arbitration the evidence regarding such facts and information to the extent that it is proffered by the Respondent not to prove criminal guilt but to prove the illegality of the Claimants\u2019 activities under public international law. There is therefore reason to dismiss the Motion also regarding evidence relating to criminal proceedings.21\n\n*Supra,* para. 79\n\nSee para. 70 for the same conclusion regarding the other evidence.\n\n84.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue raised by the Motion is not the admissibility of the evidence related to criminal proceedings. The issue is rather the probative value of such evidence for the purposes of this arbitration, which the Tribunal is empowered to weigh and determine.22 In assessing this value, the Tribunal shall be guided, among other things, by consideration of the presumption of innocence as a rule of public international law.23\n\nRule 34(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules: \"The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence and of its probative value\".\n\nThe respect due to the presumption of innocence is accepted also by Respondent. Referring to some of DIICOT investigations, the Respondent states: \"While all of the financial crimes and mismanagement discussed above are serious and, if Hassan Awdi and his associates are convicted, deserving of significant punishment...\", the footnote after the word \"convicted\" mentioning that \"they are of course for the time being presumed innocent in the criminal proceedings\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 240).\n\n85.\n\nThe issue raised by the Motion, which relates to the interplay between this arbitration and the criminal proceedings against Mr. Hassan Awdi and his co-defendants, shall have to wait for the full development and conclusion of the merits phase. In its communication of May 24, 2013, the Tribunal has already pointed to the link between the jurisdictional issues and the merits in this case to exclude any bifurcation of the proceeding.\n\n86.\n\nNo decision shall therefore be made regarding the value of evidence produced in this arbitration which relates to or emanates from the criminal proceedings. Any such decision shall have to wait for the conclusion of the merits phase of the arbitration. For the same reason, no decision shall be made at this stage regarding the costs of this phase of the proceedings.\n\nIV. DECISION\n------------\n\n87.\n\nIn the light of all the foregoing and after due consideration of the Parties\u2019 written and oral submissions and the evidence proffered by each of them, the Tribunal holds and decides as follows:\n\n1. The Motion filed by the Claimants on May 1, 2013, is dismissed.\n\n2. Any other claims or demands by either Party are denied.\n\n3. The costs of this phase of the proceedings shall be considered at a later stage."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2015-03-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n***Dramatis Personae***\n\n**Hassan Awdi -** one of the Claimants; owner of EBI and Alfa El Corporation\n\n**Hussein Awdi -** twin brother of Claimant Hassan Awdi\n\n**Mehdi Awdi -** brother of Claimant Hassan Awdi\n\n**Wafa Awdi -** wife of Claimant Hassan Awdi\n\n**Dorin Cojanu -** former financial expert and auditor at AVAS\n\n**Cornel Virgil Florea -** administrator of Consulta 99 SRL; which is the judicial administrator of Rodipet\n\n**Liliana H\u00e2rsan -** supervisor advisor at the National Agency of Fiscal Administration (ANAF)\n\n**Giorgiana Hosu -** DIICOT Chief Prosecutor\n\n**Grigore Jean -** shareholder in SC Restaurant Bucur J&P SRL\n\n**Florin Lungaci -** general manager of Rodipet\n\n**Luciana Mott -** daughter and heir of Dumitru Soare\n\n**C\u00e2t\u00e2lin Nitu -** appointed on 16 July 2009 by AVAS as provisional administrator of Rodipet\n\n**Luculescu Petre -** shareholder in SC Restaurant Bucur J&P SRL\n\n**Mariana Predescu -** director of Post-Privatization Department of AVAS\n\n**Dumitru Soare -** first heir to Casa Soare, deceased; began restitution claim\n\n**Stefan Soare -** son and heir of Dumitru Soare\n\n**Vasile Uifalean -** appointed on 8 February 2010 by AVAS to be Special Administrator of Rodipet to represent shareholders in the insolvency proceedings\n\n**Mircea Ursache -** former President of AVAS\n\nGlossary of Legal Persons\n\n**Enterprise Business Consultants, Inc.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Treaty of 28 May 1992 between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Romania Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, which entered into force on 15 January 1994, and Protocols of 28 May 1992 and 22 September 2003 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\"). The dispute was also submitted on the basis of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force 14 October 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nHassan Awdi, a man involved in international business activities for over two decades, went to Romania in 1992 to pursue opportunities at a time when the Romanian economy was being liberalized after the fall of communism. Both directly or indirectly through his companies, Hassan Awdi invested in various industries in Romania, including press distribution, real estate, leisure, and hospitality.\n\n3.\n\nSpecifically with respect to this dispute, Hassan Awdi and his co-Claimants acquired a press distribution company called Rodipet, which was a privatized company previously owned by the Romanian State. Claimants also acquired a historic property called Casa Soare, later renamed Casa Bucur from a company owned by a Romanian State agency. Claimants turned Casa Bucur into a luxury boutique hotel and restaurant.\n\n4.\n\nRegarding Rodipet, Claimants and the Romanian Authority for State Assets Recovery (\"AVAS\") signed a Privatization Contract for the sale-purchase of Rodipet shares. Both sides to the Privatization Contract undertook various commitments. On the one hand, AVAS undertook that Romania would extinguish tax liabilities and other debt owed to it by Rodipet and grant to Rodipet a maximum of a 49-year concession over land housing press distribution points. On the other hand, Claimants undertook to raise EUR 2 million in capital for Rodipet, make technical investments totalling EUR 3.75 million in the company, as well as various other commitments, *e.g,* relating to labour relations with Rodipet\u2019s employees. The dispute arose when Romania allegedly revoked the law granting the land concession to Rodipet and took control over Claimants\u2019 indirect shareholding in the company.\n\n5.\n\nWith respect to Casa Bucur, the dispute arose when the Romanian Supreme Court decided that Claimants\u2019 acquired property should be returned to the people who had owned it originally before the property came under State ownership.\n\n6.\n\nClaimants contend that these actions resulted in a breach by Respondent of various provisions of the United States-Romania BIT, including the requirement of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, the prohibition against unreasonable and discriminatory measures, the provisions on expropriation guarantees and observance of obligations.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n7.\n\nThere are three Claimants: (1) Hassan Awdi, a natural person having the nationality of the United States; (2) Enterprise Business Consultants, Inc. (\"EBC\"), a company incorporated in Delaware, United States, and wholly owned by Hassan Awdi; and (3) Alfa El Corporation (\"Alfa\"), also a company incorporated in Delaware, United States, and wholly owned by Hassan Awdi.\n\n8.\n\nClaimants are represented by Dr. Ra\u00ebd M. Fadlallah and Mr. Tim Portwood of Bredin Prat, and by Mr. Jeffrey W. Sarles (until January 2014), Mr. Dany Khayat and Dr. Jos\u00e9 Caicedo of Mayer Brown.\n\n9.\n\nRespondent is Romania. It is represented by Dr. Veijo Heiskanen, Mr. Matthias Scherer, and Ms. Laura Halonen of Lalive; and by Dr. Crenguta Leaua, Mr. Marius Grigorescu, and Ms. Mihaela Maravela of Leaua & Asociatii.\n\n10.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 June 2010, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 31 May 2010 from Hassan Awdi, EBC, and Alfa against Romania (the \"Request\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 16 June 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nIn the Request, Claimants proposed a Tribunal consisting of three arbitrators, with one arbitrator appointed by Claimants, one arbitrator appointed by Respondent, and the presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators. Claimants reiterated their proposal by letter of 18 June 2010. By letter of 25 June 2010, Claimants requested a prompt constitution of the Tribunal and informed ICSID that they were appointing Dr. Hamid Gharavi, a national of France and Iran, as arbitrator. On 1 July 2010, the Centre notified the Parties that if they failed to agree on a method of constituting the Tribunal within 60 days after the registration of the Request, either party could invoke Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention as a default method.\n\n14.\n\nOn 16 August 2010, Claimants invoked Article 37(2)(b). The next day, the Centre advised Respondent that the Tribunal was to be constituted according to Article 37(2)(b) and invited the parties to make appointments accordingly. On 31 August 2010, Claimants confirmed their appointment of Dr. Gharavi. On 16 September 2010, Respondent appointed Professor Rudolf Dolzer, a national of Germany, as arbitrator.\n\n15.\n\nSubsequently, the parties agreed that the two co-arbitrators would attempt to agree on a presiding arbitrator. This process did not, however, yield any results. On 30 November 2010, Claimants requested that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appoint a presiding arbitrator under Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. Before the appointment was made, Claimants and Respondent informed ICSID, by their respective letters of 17 and 18 January 2011, that they had agreed to appoint Professor Piero Bernardini, a national of Italy, as presiding arbitrator.\n\n16.\n\nOn 19 January 2011, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\") notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. A\u00efssatou Diop, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**B. First Session and Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 December 2010, before the Tribunal was constituted, Claimants had filed a Request for Provisional Measures, essentially asking the Tribunal to order Romania to:\n\n- refrain from engaging in conduct that may aggravate the dispute or change the *status quo* prior to the initiation of a criminal investigation that Romania had instituted against Hassan Awdi, his associates, and members of the Awdi family;\n\n- discontinue immediately or stay immediately the criminal proceedings in relation to Rodipet (DIICOT case No. 390/D/P/2006) and any other criminal case concerning the subject matter of this arbitration;\n\n- lift immediately measures taken in the context of its criminal proceedings affecting Claimants, their associates, and members of the Awdi family;\n\n- immediately allow and ensure unrestricted freedom of movement in, out, and within Romania to Hassan Awdi at all times free of any pressure, threats, or harassment of any type by Romanian authorities;\n\n- return to Claimants unrestricted and immediate possession of all documents sequestered in the course of the criminal proceedings in DIICOT case No. 390/D/P/2006, or, in the alternative, a full, accurate, complete and unedited copy of the same;\n\n- immediately refrain from taking any action directly or indirectly through or with the media operating in Romania or elsewhere the effect of which may be to aggravate the dispute which is the subject of this arbitration;\n\n- refrain immediately from any action to intercept, listen to, interfere with and/or record by any means whatsoever of communications of any nature whatsoever and using any means whatsoever between Claimants\u2019 legal counsel on the one hand and Claimants or their representatives;\n\n- immediately permit Claimants\u2019 legal counsel to have access, free from surveillance of any type, to any person physically present on Romanian territory for the purposes of investigating, preparing, and/or conducting Claimants\u2019 case in this arbitration;\n\n- refrain immediately from any action the effect of which may be the harassment of the employees, former employees, directors, former directors and/or owners of Rodipet;\n\n- produce to Claimants full, complete, accurate and unedited copies of the videos taken by DIICOT during the raids of premises of Claimants conducted on 22 June 2010 and thereafter.1\n\nCl. Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 256.\n\n18.\n\nOn 29 December 2010, the ICSID Secretary-General set a schedule for Respondent to file its observations on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures, and for each party to file a rebuttal. The schedule was amended on 7 January 2011 at Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n19.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, after the constitution of the Tribunal, Claimants filed a Request for a Temporary Restraining Order (\"TRO\") with immediate effect. The TRO requested the Tribunal to order, pending a decision on provisional measures, Romania to 1) refrain from ordering the appearance of Hassan Awdi, members of his family, and his associates before judicial and/or administrative authorities in the context of criminal investigations; 2) allow and ensure unrestricted freedom of movement in, out, and within Romania of Hassan Awdi, members of his family, and his associates; and, 3) refrain from communicating to persons involved with the criminal investigations documents produced or prepared in the context of this arbitration.2 On 28 January 2011, Respondent filed its Response on Provisional Measures which addressed Claimants\u2019 requests of 23 December 2010 and 25 January 2011. On 1 February 2011, the Tribunal denied Claimants\u2019 request for a TRO, finding that the circumstances of the case and the evidence proffered by Claimants did not convincingly support their request for a TRO.3\n\nCl. letter addressed to Tribunal, 25 Jan. 2011, \u00b6 34.\n\nICSID letter addressed to the Parties, 1 Feb. 2011.\n\n20.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, Claimants filed their Reply on Provisional Measures, and on 3 March 2011, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Provisional Measures.\n\n21.\n\nOn 10 March 2011, the Tribunal held a first session and hearing on provisional measures in Paris.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 March 2011, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures in Procedural Order No. 1, dismissing Claimants\u2019 request. The Tribunal found that \"Claimants, at this juncture of the proceedings, have failed to demonstrate that an order for provisional measures is justified in the circumstances.\"4 With respect to Claimants\u2019 substantive rights, the Tribunal concluded that \"Claimants have not met their burden of proof to establish that the due process or fundamental rights of the investigated persons have been violated by Respondent. Namely, Claimants have not demonstrated that the criminal investigations and more generally the proceedings have been conducted in violation of Romanian law nor that the rights of the investigated persons have been violated.\"5 With respect to Claimants\u2019 procedural rights, the Tribunal concluded that it \"agrees with Romania that the pending criminal proceedings against Mr. Awdi will not prevent the decision of the legal issues brought before it.\"6 According to the Tribunal, \"[o]ne aspect of this procedural right deserves particular attention, access to documents that have been seized in the context of the criminal investigations.... [However,] [a]ccess to Mr. Awdi\u2019s and Rodipet\u2019s seized and retained documents having so been regulated, there is no need for provisional measures meant to avoid irreparable harm to Claimants\u2019 interests.\"7\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 95.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 56.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 75.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 93.\n\n23.\n\nAt the first session, the Parties disagreed on the schedule of pleadings. The Tribunal decided that there would be a Memorial and a Counter-Memorial, four months each; and a Reply and Rejoinder, three months each. Respondent reserved the right to raise preliminary objections and request bifurcation after Claimants\u2019 filing of their Memorial. The schedule of pleadings would start to run from the end of an interim period, during which Respondent would provide to Claimants access to documents previously seized by Romanian authorities and required by Claimants to prepare their case. These documents included hard copies of documents seized from Hassan Awdi, electronic documents seized from Hassan Awdi, electronic data and documents seized from Rodipet. The length of the interim period would be determined after Respondent had consulted with the Romanian competent authorities regarding the amount of time required to make the seized documents available to Claimants and informed the Tribunal.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent so informed the Tribunal by letter of 16 March 2011. On 29 March 2011, the Tribunal issued its decision on the schedule of written pleadings, setting the length of the interim period at two months. Reiterating its previous decision on the schedule, Claimants\u2019 Memorial was due four months after the interim period, and Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial four months thereafter. Claimants\u2019 Reply and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder were each due two months after receipt of the precedent pleading. Furthermore, the hearing was to take place no later than three months after the exchange of written pleadings, with the precise hearing date to be determined subsequently.\n\n25.\n\nOn 8 April 2011, the Tribunal issued the Minutes of the First Session embodying the agreement of the parties and the remaining decisions of the Tribunal partly as follows: the Tribunal had been properly constituted, the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, English would be the procedural language, and Paris, France, would be the place of proceedings.\n\n26.\n\nOn 27 June 2012, the Parties submitted an agreed procedural calendar for the remainder of the proceeding. On the basis of the procedural calendar, as approved by the Tribunal, Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits on 20 October 2012, and Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on 15 March 2013.\n\n27.\n\nOn 1 May 2013, Claimants filed a Motion for a Summary Decision on the Admissibility of Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objection (the \"Motion\"). The Motion was directed to Respondent\u2019s third objection to jurisdiction in the Counter-Memorial that Claimants\u2019 actions were not in good faith and their claims were inadmissible due to the looting and mismanagement of Rodipet and allegations of human trafficking of Honduran nationals.8 The Motion claimed that Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction was based on facts and information that were the subject of ongoing criminal investigations or proceedings which Respondent was estopped from using as the basis for an objection in the arbitration proceeding, having repeatedly given assurances as to the separateness of the criminal proceedings from this arbitration proceeding.9\n\nResp. C-Mem\" \u00b6\u00b6 425 *et seq.*\n\nMotion, \u00b6\u00b6 14 *et seq.*\n\n28.\n\nClaimants also requested a modification of the procedural calendar that was originally set on 27 June 2012, as modified on 11 February 2013. By letter of 3 May 2013, Respondent contended that there was no procedural basis for the Tribunal to deal with the Motion, to which Claimants replied by letter of 8 May 2013. On 10 May 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to admit the Motion. On 24 May 2013, the Tribunal set a procedural calendar for the Motion to be addressed. Based on this calendar, Respondent filed a Reply on the Motion on 17 June 2013. The Tribunal held a hearing on the Motion on 9 and 10 July 2013 in Paris. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal, the following persons attended the hearing.\n\n- For Claimants : Hassan Awdi, Claimant; Ra\u00ebd Fadlallah, Hollis Dufour, and Liliane Djahangir of Bredin Prat; Dany Khayat, Jos\u00e9 Caicedo, Joy Kreidi, and William Ahem of Mayer Brown; Violeta Oancea, Adrain Bendeac, and Andrei Oancea as Hassan Awdi\u2019s local counsel.\n\n- For Respondent : Veijo Heiskanen, Matthias Scherer, and Laura Hanoi en of Lalive; Crenguta Leaua, Marius Grigorescu, and Stefan Dudas of Leaua & Asociatii.\n\n29.\n\nOn 26 July 2013, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Admissibility of the Respondent\u2019s Third Objection to Jurisdiction and Admissibility of Claimants\u2019 Claim (\"Decision on the Motion\"), dismissing Claimants\u2019 Motion. The Tribunal found in part:\n\n(70) Evidence relied upon by the Respondent may be freely tested by the Claimants. The latter may call on their own motion or, if needed, with the Tribunal\u2019s assistance, each person having signed witness statements or expert reports to appear at the October 2013 hearing to be cross-examined, regardless of whether the statements or reports were prepared for the purpose of this arbitration if not subject to confidentiality under the criminal proceedings. They may likewise dispute any part of the documentary evidence proffered by the Respondent. The Claimants\u2019 right to challenge evidence is a sufficient reason for the dismissal of the Motion since the latter requests that the entirety of the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objection be declared inadmissible even when that objection is founded on evidence unrelated to or not emanating from criminal proceedings.\n\n[...]\n\n(83) Regarding evidence related to criminal proceedings that the Respondent invites the Tribunal to consider, what matters for the issue before the Tribunal is not that the facts and information relied upon by the Respondent for its admissibility objection are all subjected to the on-going investigations or criminal proceedings in Romania, as contended by the Motion (para. 2). What matters is the Claimants\u2019 right to challenge in this arbitration the evidence regarding such facts and information to the extent that it is proffered by the Respondent not to prove criminal guilt but to prove the illegality of the Claimants\u2019 activities under public international law. There is therefore reason to dismiss the Motion also regarding evidence relating to criminal proceedings.\n\n(84) In conclusion, the issue raised by the Motion is not the admissibility of the evidence related to criminal proceedings. The issue is rather the probative value of such evidence for the purposes of this arbitration, which the Tribunal is empowered to weigh and determine. In assessing this value, the Tribunal shall be guided, among other things, by consideration of the presumption of innocence as a rule of public international law (internal citations omitted).10\n\nDecision, 26 July 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 83-84.\n\n30.\n\nOn 31 May 2013, the Parties agreed to modify the procedural calendar of 11 February 2013. The Tribunal approved it on 4 June 2013. Thus, Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits on 15 June 2013, in parallel with the procedural steps relating to the Claimants\u2019 Motion, and their Response to Respondent\u2019s Inadmissibility Objection on 9 August 2013. Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 4 October 2013, and Claimants filed their Rejoinder to the Respondent\u2019s Inadmissibility Objection on 15 October 2013.\n\n31.\n\nClaimants filed their request for production of documents on 1 May 2013, Respondent submitted comments on the request on 17 May 2013, and Claimants answered on 10 June 2013. The Tribunal issued its decision on the request on 18 June 2013. Respondent filed its request for production of documents on 25 April 2013. Subsequently, the Parties had an exchange of communications leading to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the request of 19 August 2013.\n\n32.\n\nOn 12 September 2013, Respondent filed a Request for a Consent Order regarding an expert report to be filed in DIICOT Case No. 390/D/P/2006 which was responded to by Claimants on 20 September 2013. The Tribunal decided on 27 September 2013 that Respondent\u2019s request would be considered once the expert report shall become available.\n\n**C. Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties on 22 October 2013 to discuss certain outstanding procedural issues. The Parties agreed, and the Tribunal concurred, that the period reserved for the hearing would not be sufficient and that additional days would be required and set.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction and merits in Paris from 28 October to 1 November 2013. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were:\n\n- For Claimants : Hassan Awdi, Claimant; Dany Khayat, Jos\u00e9 Caicedo, William Ahem, and Joy Kreidi of the law firm of Mayer Brown; Tim Portwood, Ra\u00ebd Fadlallah, Hollis Dufour, Liliane Djahangir, Shane Daly, and Laura Fadhallah of the law firm of Bredin Prat; Violeta Oancea, Adrain Bendeac, Andrei Oancea, and Raluca Petrescu as Hassan Awdi\u2019s local counsel in Romania; and Alexandra Niculae of the law firm of Popovici Nitu & Asociatii.\n\n- For Respondent : Veijo Heiskanen, Matthias Scherer, Laura Hanoi en, Sam Moss, and Emilie McConaughey of the law firm of Lalive; Crenguta Leaua, Marius Grigorescu, Stefan Deaconu, Andra Filatov, and Mihaela Maravela of the law firm of Leaua & Asociatii.\n\n35.\n\nThe following witnesses and experts were examined:\n\n- On behalf of Claimants : Jean Grigore (by videolink), Ana Calenic, Florin Lungaci, Mehdi Awdi, Hassan Awdi, Georgeta Popescu, and Bazil Oglinda (expert).\n\n- On behalf of Respondent : Mariana Predescu, Mircea Ursache, Dorin Cojanu, Iulia Nistor, Cornel Florea, Gheorghe Piperea (expert), and Lucian Mihai (expert).\n\nAn additional witness, Vasile Uifalean, was examined by Claimants, however, not in the capacity of witness for Respondent.\n\n36.\n\nOn 4 November 2013, the Tribunal submitted post-hearing questions to the Parties, and the Parties filed their respective Answers on 17 January 2014. Regarding the Parties\u2019 agreement to postpone part of the hearing until a later time,11 the Tribunal decided to retain the dates of 4 and 5 February 2014 for the examination of quantum experts and closing arguments.\n\n*See* \u00b6 32 above.\n\n**D. Hearing on Quantum**\n-------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal held a hearing on quantum in Paris as scheduled. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were:\n\n- For Claimants : Hassan Awdi, Claimant; Dany Khayat, Jos\u00e9 Caicedo, William Ahem, and Joy Kreidi of the law firm of Mayer Brown; Ra\u00ebd Fathallah, Hollis Dufour, Liliane Djahangir, Shane Daly, and Laura Fadhallah of the law firm of Bredin Prat; Rosie Barnes, and Matthew McDevitt of BDO International.\n\n- For Respondent : Veijo Heiskanen, Matthias Scherer, Laura Hanolen, Emilie McConaughey, and David Bonifacio of the law firm of Lalive; Crenguta Leaua, Marius Grigorescu, Stefan Deaconu, and Mihaela Maravela of the law firm of Leaua & Asociatii.\n\n38.\n\nThe following experts were examined:\n\n- On behalf of Claimants : Gervase MacGregor of BDO International.\n\n- On behalf of Respondent : Andrew Grantham of AlixPartners.\n\n39.\n\nOn 7 February 2014, the Tribunal issued a ruling which laid down the conduct of the remainder of the procedure and addressed questions to the parties to be answered in their respective post-hearing submissions.\n\n40.\n\nBased on the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, the Parties filed one round of simultaneous post-hearing briefs (\"PHBs\") on 19 March 2014.\n\n41.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 12 May 2014, Claimants produced additional evidence on 28 May 2014, which was commented upon by Respondent on 13 June 2014, Claimants providing their comments on 30 June 2014.\n\n42.\n\nThe Parties filed their submissions on costs on 19 November 2014 and their reply cost statements on 1 December 2014.\n\n43.\n\nThe proceeding was declared closed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38 on January 13, 2015.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal needs to set out the factual matrix of this case as it arises from the evidence, written and oral, presented by the Parties. To do so, it will adopt a chronological timeline when possible, taking into consideration that the Parties are in disagreement over all important facts, such disagreement being more than often manifested in an acrimonious manner. To the extent relevant or useful, some facts will be discussed in more detail in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the disputed issues. The Tribunal cannot fail to note at the outset the manner by which the Parties, without sparing time and efforts, have pleaded their claims and defences by providing extensive written submissions, repeatedly filing requests for procedural measures and accumulating an extraordinary amount of factual and legal evidence in support of the respective positions, much beyond what the legitimate protection of their respective positions would have demanded. This has required inordinate, time-consuming engagement by the Tribunal, mostly concerned with ensuring equality of the Parties and establishing what out of Parties\u2019 production is really relevant for its decision.\n\n**A. Rodipet**\n--------------\n\n45.\n\nClaimants invested in outdoor advertising by creating the media and advertising company Supremo Media (formerly, Bueno Corporation). Supremo Media was part of a larger group of companies, called the Miami Group, which were owned by Claimants and specialized in the distribution and sale of consumer electronics.12\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\n46.\n\nIn 1997, Supremo Media signed two contracts with Rodipet S.A. Bucuresti (\"Rodipet,\" later \"S.C. Network Press Concept\") for the rental of the top of kiosks and the distribution of merchandise. In the context of this collaboration, Rodipet accumulated debt toward Supremo worth approximately EUR 61,359,400. Due to the size of the debt and to Hassan Awdi\u2019s recognition of the financial potential of Rodipet, he decided to acquire Rodipet13 and to request the Government to transform the debt to Supremo into shares of the company.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 49.\n\n47.\n\nRodipet was a state-owned company under the management of AVAS. It owned a network of 1,400 kiosks, over 200 cars, employed 3,032 people, and had a significant number of real estate properties.14\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.\n\n48.\n\nIn November 2003, AVAS started the privatization process of Rodipet. S.C. Magnar Systems Com Srl **(\"Magnar\"),** a company owned and controlled by Claimants **(\"Magnar\"),** was finally selected based on an initial bid that had been improved during the negotiation sessions.15\n\nResp. C-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n49.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the presentation file of Rodipet noted as a \"weak point\" the fact that kiosks were located on lands rented from local bodies for limited periods of time. Magnar initially sought a 49-year lease over these lands. AVAS notified Magnar of AVAS\u2019 lack of authority to issue any orders in connection with the lands. Magnar responded by requesting a concession of the lands by Government Resolution or Order of Minister or the like. AVAS retained its initial position.16 Respondent notes that \"[i]t is unclear what occurred between the last meeting at which this requirement was discussed and the signature of the Privatization Contract.\"17\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 71.\n\n**1. The Privatization Contract**\n---------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn 23 December 2003, AVAS and Magnar signed Contract of Shares Sale-Purchase No. 62 of 23/12/2003 (the \"Privatization Contract\") for the sale to Magnar of 90,574 shares representing 100% of Rodipet\u2019s share capital.18 The purchase price was ROL 2,266,614,350 (equivalent to EUR 54,600 according to Claimants or EUR 54,599,70 and USD 70,494,60 according to Respondent19) which, Claimants add, \"reflected the financial situation of Rodipet as well as the heavy debt it owed to the Awdi Group.\"20 The new owner and the new board members were registered with the Chamber of Trade on 10 May 2004.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 72.\n\nResp. C- Mem., \u00b6 54.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 47.\n\n51.\n\nThe Privatization Contract had a certain number of obligations for both parties. As well, it carried \"[a] strict sanction regime... to encourage Magnar to comply with its obligations.\"21 The sanction regime was based on AVAS model contract and was familiar to bidders.22 The most relevant obligations (and sanction) for the purposes of this dispute and related performance of each party are set out below.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 66.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 66.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Main Obligations Under the Privatization Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a. The business obligations*\n-----------------------------\n\n52.\n\nUnder Article 10.5 of the Privatization Contract, Magnar had to maintain the main activity of the company for five years following the transfer of ownership of the shares. Under Article 10.6 of the Privatization Contract, Magnar undertook to achieve for five years a turnover out of which a minimum of 70% would be obtained from the company\u2019s main activity.23 Non-compliance with the obligations under Article 10.5 was subject to the payment of penalties under Article 10.7 of the Privatization Contract. In addition, under Article 10.12, Magnar undertook for five years \"not to decide and/or not to arrange for the voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the Company\" under penalty of payment of a fine.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 55.\n\n53.\n\nFurthermore, under Articles 11.1 and 11.2 of the Privatization Contract, Magnar undertook not to alienate in any form assets owned by Rodipet under penalty of paying an amount equal to the market value of the asset.\n\n*b. The social obligations*\n---------------------------\n\n54.\n\nMagnar had two main social obligations. Under Article 10.8 of the Privatization Contract, Magnar would assume all existing rights and liabilities regarding Rodipet\u2019s collective labour agreements with trade unions, individual employment contracts, and applicable legislation. Under Article 10.9, Magnar had to maintain for at least five years employees holding a Labour Contract of indefinite duration at the time it acquired Rodipet\u2019s shares.24 Breach of Article 10.9 carried the sanction of termination of the Privatization Contract under Article 10.10 without notice or formality.25\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 66.\n\n*c. The investment and reporting obligations*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nRespondent writes that \"[t]he investment obligation and accompanying pledge included in the final version of the Privatization Contract are explained fairly by the Claimants in the Memorial.\"26\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 62.\n\n56.\n\nFirst, under Article 13.1 of the Privatization Contract, Magnar had to make two infusions of working capital amounting to USD 1 million each into Rodipet, the first infusion being due 30 days after the date of transfer of ownership of the share and the second one year after the same date. Ten days after each due period, Magnar would provide an audited Certificate verifying fulfillment of the obligation. To guarantee performance of the obligation, Magnar provided a Letter of Bank Guarantee to AVAS which, under Article 13.5 of the Privatization Contract, AVAS could execute in case Magnar failed to provide proof of timely performance of its obligation under Article 13.1. Under Article 13.6, if Magnar failed to present certificates or if the certificates presented failed to prove compliance with the Article 13.1 obligations, AVAS could cancel the Privatization Contract without prior formality.\n\n57.\n\nSecond, under Article 14.1 of the Privatization Contract, Magnar had the obligation to follow a program of technical investments of EUR 3,750,000 over five years from the date of transfer of ownership of the shares. Under Appendix No. 6, this investment was aimed at upgrading the vehicle fleet, information technology, and the kiosks. Magnar was required to provide an audited Certificate for each yearly instalment that had been made. A delayed submission of the Certificates would be subject to the payment of a fine.27\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 51-54.\n\n58.\n\nEach phase of the investment was backed by Magnar signing a Share Pledge Agreement (the \"First Share Pledge Agreement\") and ultimately by a Letter of Bank Guarantee.28 In case of non-compliance, AVAS could simply call on the Pledge on shares.29 Magnar agreed that for each investment phase, the number of shares of Rodipet encumbered in favor of AVAS would be at least 51%.30 Article 15.4 of the Privatization Agreement provided:\n\nin case of Magnar\u2019s failure to observe its obligations set out in Article 14.1 (the 5-year investment program) at any stage of the investment... AVAS shall be entitled to entirely execute the Pledge on the shares and the bank guarantee letter issued for the relevant stage of the investment. In the event of enforcement of the Pledges, such measure does not exempt Magnar from the continued performance of the Privatization Contract, save for the case that following such enforcement Magnar is no longer Rodipet\u2019s shareholder.\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6 52.\n\n60.\n\nAdditionally, in order to ensure the proper performance of Magnar\u2019s financial obligations, the Privatization Contract provided for a Pledge over Rodipet\u2019s Additional Shares subsequently transferred to Magnar in order to guarantee the performance of the second phase of the investment under a Pledge Agreement dated 24 June 2004 (the **\"Second Share Pledge Agreement\").32**\n\nSee \u00b6 72 below for the Additional Shares.\n\n*d. Rodipet\u2019s Restructuring Plan*\n---------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Privatization Contract provided that Magnar had to notify the Competition Council (\"CC\") regarding the transaction covered thereby (Article 7.1) and that the CC had to issue a Decision approving the transaction (Article 7.2). Should the CC fail to approve the transaction, the Privatization Contract would cease to have effect (\"will be disbanded\": Article 7.3). There is no evidence in the file of these proceedings of the CC\u2019s approval of the Privatization Contract. However, on 29 May 2006 the CC issued a Decision (the \"CC Decision\") regulating the granting of State aids to Rodipet based on the latters\u2019 undertaking a restructuring plan to restore its viability.33\n\nDecision of the Competition Council dated 29 May 2006 (C-50); Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 62-78.\n\n62.\n\nThe CC Decision followed the association of Romania with the European Communities and their Member States of 1993 and the Regulation on \"State aid for rescue and restructuring of firms in difficulty\" of 17 December 2004. The CC Decision recognized that the financial support measures granted to Rodipet at privatization for a total of RON 48,415,858 and notified by AVAS, consisting in the State renouncing to collect certain revenues, represented State aid,34 that Rodipet was a \"firm in difficulty,\"35 and that the restructuring plan proposed by Rodipet would lead to the restoration of the long term viability of Rodipet.36\n\nC-50, \u00b6 40.\n\nC-50, \u00b6 50.\n\nC-50, \u00b6 59.\n\n63.\n\nRodipet\u2019s restructuring plan required a financial effort for a total costofRON 143,716.8 of which RON 76,283,8 (EUR 18,524,271)37 were committed by the Buyer *[i.e.* Magnar System], RON 18,967,0 (EUR 4,666,800) were committed by Rodipet, and RON 48,466,00 were contributed by the State aid.38 The major part of the restructuring plan was represented by measures regarding the technological restructuring of Rodipet (RON 88,042,5).39 The deadline for implementing the measures was 2008 (at the end of the restructuring period).40\n\nThe conversion of RON into EUR is taken from Claimants\u2019 Answer to the Tribunal\u2019s Questions dated 17 January 2014 (\"Cl. Answers\"), \u00b6 50.\n\nC-50, \u00b6 27.\n\nC-50, \u00b6 30.\n\nC-50, \u00b6 27.\n\n64.\n\nIt is unclear whether there is a relationship between the restructuring plan of Rodipet and the \"investment for growth\" committed by Magnar under the Privatization Contract over the period of 5 years from May 2004 (date of share transfer in Rodipet), for a total of EUR 3,750,000. Since Magnar\u2019s contribution under the restructuring plan was equal to RON 76,283,8 (equivalent to EUR 18,757,471), the amount of investment for growth under the Privatization Contract (EUR 3,750,000) and the one charged to Magnar under the restructuring plan do not coincide.\n\n65.\n\nAlso the time of investment in the restructuring plan is not the same as the one for investments for growth. Further, the restructuring plan is also the obligation of Rodipet, not only of Magnar, and failure to fulfil the same will entail the revocation of the State aid but none of the sanctions provided under the Privatization Contract for failure to fulfil the investment for growth under Article 14 and Appendix No. 6.41\n\nWitness Statement of Iulia Nistor, \u00b6 40; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 64.\n\n66.\n\nAccording to Claimants, amounts invested pursuant to the restructuring program were not in addition to those under the Privatization Contract as they were independent obligations so that \"any amounts invested into Rodipet pursuant to the Privatization Contract were also relevant for the purposes of the restructuring obligations... [b]oth sets of obligations had the same goal. Fulfilment of one necessarily meant fulfilment, to the extent relevant, of the other\".42\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 50.\n\n67.\n\nThere is one document in the file apparently establishing a link between the two sets of investment obligations, Ex. R-222. This document was relied upon by Claimants as \"informal\" evidence of the fulfilment by Magnar of the 4th year investment obligation.43 The pertinence of this document to Magnar\u2019s investment obligation is challenged by Respondent which refers it to Rodipet\u2019s restructuring obligation and contends that it is a mere collection of data sheets from Rodipet listing invoices.44\n\nLetter to AVAS dated 11/27 March 2009 (C-67, last page).\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 89-90, 243-247.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Party has raised any claim regarding specifically Rodipet\u2019s restructuring plan.\n\n**3. Respondent\u2019s Main Obligations under the Privatization Contract**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAVAS\u2019 obligations under Article 3 of the Privatization Contract were subject to the issuance of legislation which would extinguish through conversion into shares, annul, or reschedule Rodipet\u2019s pre-existing liabilities that were due to the State at the time of the transfer of Rodipet\u2019s shares to Magnar.45 As well, the legislation would provide for the granting of a 49-year concession of the lands on which points of sale were located.46 These conditions were to be fulfilled by 31 March 2004, failing which the Privatization Contract would be cancelled.47\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 72.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 63.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 63; Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 74.\n\n*a. Extinction of Rodipet\u2019s tax liabilities and other debts to the* *State*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nWith regard to Rodipet\u2019s tax liabilities and other debts to the State, the Privatization Contract provided, in part:\n\nArticle 3.1\n\nPublication in the Official Gazette of Romania of a piece of legislation that is to provide the following:\n\nI a) The extinction by conversion into shares of:\n\n- the budgetary liabilities due and unpaid by the Company at the time of the transfer of the ownership right over the Shares...as well as those representing the total of their own liabilities and those generated by budgetary loans managed by APAPS,\n\n- the Company\u2019s liabilities to the Autonomous Authority of the State Protocol, calculated to the date of transfer of the ownership right of shares.\n\nGovernment Emergency Order 45/2004 was issued on 29 January 2004. It fulfilled the condition regarding the debts to the State.\n\n*b. The 49-year land concession*\n--------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nWith respect to the land concession, the Privatization Contract included two provisions, one relating to the concession of land for existing points of sale, and the other relating to the concession of land for future points of sale. For existing points of sale, Article 3.1, paragraph III provided, in part:\n\nThe concession to the Company, by the State and by the administrative territorial units, for 49 years, of the lands owned by them and belonging to the points of sale existing on the Romanian territory at the time of signing the Contract....\n\n72.\n\nOn 30 April 2004, AVAS and Magnar signed Addendum No. 2 to the Privatization Contract which amended Article 3.1 by adding a \"reasonable efforts clause.\" Thus, AVAS and Magnar now agreed to the following:\n\nThe Seller undertakes to make all reasonable efforts for the issuance of a normative document stipulating the granting to the Company, by the State [.sic] by the administrative-territorial units and for a period of 49 years, of the lands owned by the latter and relating to the points of sale existing on Romania\u2019s territory upon the date of signing the Contract, except for those in Bucharest...as well as for the setting-up of new points of sale in order to complete the investment program undertaken on the grounds of the Shares Sale-Purchase Contract.48\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 65; Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n\n73.\n\nFor future points of sale, Article 9.12 of the Privatization Contract already provided:\n\nThe **Seller** will make efforts, within the legal competence, for the concession to the Company, for a term of 49 years, of the lands owned by [.sic] State and by the territorial administrative units, lands that are necessary for the points of sale that will be open, by the Company, in the areas of sale of national and European interest press, during the performance of the investment programmed assumed under this Contract.49\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 73.\n\n*c. Transfer of ownership of Rodipet\u2019s shares*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nUnder Article 4.1 of the Privatization Contract, AVAS\u2019 main obligation was to transfer, within five days of AVAS notifying Magnar of the fulfillment of the conditions stipulated at Article 3.1, the ownership of the shares of Rodipet to Magnar, together with all the rights and obligations under Romanian Law and the Privatization Contract.\n\n75.\n\nUnder Article 4.2 of the Privatization Contract, AVAS would sell Additional Shares to Magnar that would be created through the conversion into shares of Rodipet\u2019s tax liabilities and other debts to the State. On 20 March 2007, AVAS and Magnar signed Addendum No. 3 to the Privatization Contract pursuant to which 6,812,705 Additional Shares would be transferred for the price of LEI (RON) 170,317,63 (approximately EUR 50,440) payable in two installments, with 35% of the purchase price already paid on 8 February 2007 and 65% to be paid 10 days after the signature of Addendum No. 3.50\n\nCl.

Claimants\u2019 Performance of their Obligations**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nMagnar\u2019s obligation under the legal framework in force as of 2002 was to provide certificates of auditors and sworn management statements to demonstrate performance of its contractual obligations. AVAS did not need to check the veracity of the documents submitted, except in instances where suspicions arose in which cases the Post-Privatization Monitoring Department of AVAS would request the Control Department to conduct inspections and onsite visits for verification.51 According to Respondent, \"the first three years of postprivatization monitoring were unexceptional.\"52\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 91.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 93.\n\n*a. The business obligations*\n-----------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn August 2006, a dispute arose between AVAS and Magnar further to Magnar\u2019s change of corporate form without AVAS\u2019 prior permission, as required under Article 10.12 of the Privatization Contract. AVAS imposed a fine on Magnar which the latter refused to pay. The matter was finally resolved by arbitration won by AVAS on 5 February 2008.53\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n78.\n\nIn February 2008, Magnar sought AVAS\u2019 permission, pursuant to Article 11.1 of the Privatization Contract, to use Rodipet\u2019s real property as collateral for loans. After undertaking an overall study of Magnar\u2019s compliance with the Privatization Contract, AVAS granted such permission on the condition of Magnar providing more information regarding its compliance with its social obligations, \"an area where signs of lack of compliance had begun to emerge.\"54 On 6 May 2008, AVAS and Magnar signed Addendum No. 5 to the Privatization Contract which amended Article 11.1 to say that assets could not be alienated without AVAS\u2019 approval.55\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 98.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 100.\n\n*b. The social obligations*\n---------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAn October 2007 inspection revealed problems with trade unions, unreported layoffs, and a significant decrease in the number of Rodipet\u2019s employees. This caused AVAS to have concerns about Magnar\u2019s compliance with Article 10.8 of the Privatization Contract. Magnar sent to AVAS the documents on Magnar\u2019s performance of its social obligations in March 2008. The matter went no further at this point.56\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 100.\n\n80.\n\nPrior to that, in December 2005, Rodipet had informed AVAS that it was transferring some employees to Rodipet Courier, which, according to Respondent, had the effect of bringing those employees outside the scope of protection afforded by the Privatization Contract.57 This, according to Respondent, created a gap in Rodipet\u2019s labor force which the company sought to fill by \"trafficking humans for the purpose of forced labour.\"58 Respondent notes other issues such as a decrease overtime of the number of AVAS employees, the fact that Rodipet had stopped providing meal vouchers, paying salaries, providing social and health insurance, and making unemployment contributions.59\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 197.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 202.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 198-201.\n\n81.\n\nOn 3 November 2008, AVAS received a complaint from one of the branches of the Rodipet Free Union relating to breaches of the Collective Labour Agreement and the Social Protocol. AVAS\u2019 Post-Privatization Department requested the Control Department to perform an on-site inspection. During the inspection started on 28 November 2008 the General Manager of Rodipet, Florin Lungaci, refused to provide documents requested by the Control team and, eventually, refused to meet with them. Thus, the Control team drafted a report of failed inspection.60\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 264-69.\n\n82.\n\nFollowing a complaint by Rodipet Free Union, a meeting was held on 7 April 2009 with AVAS, Rodipet and the Union representatives. Further evidence of breach of social obligations was obtained by AVAS.61 A memo of AVAS\u2019 legal Department of 7 May 2009 concluded that \"without doubt, the social clauses were not complied with,\" recommending in a new note to the AVAS\u2019 Board of Directors of 19 May 2009 to terminate the Privatization Contract.62 AVAS notified Magnar on 13 July 2009 of the termination of the Privatization Contract, pursuant to its Article 10.10.63\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 286.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 291, 293.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 296-97.\n\n83.\n\nClaimants object to Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the Protocol with Free Trade Union of Rodipet and STPF Union regarding Magnar\u2019 social obligations, contending that obligations were to maintain 3,127 jobs as opposed to employees, which were accomplished also by transferring some employees to other companies within the Rodipet Group with full knowledge and approval of AVAS.64\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 93-96, 101-107.\n\n84.\n\nAccording to Claimants, AVAS\u2019 termination of the Privatization Contract was unlawful, a fa\u00e7ade to justify expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investments as shown by the fact that the alleged reason for the social obligations, *i.e.* to avoid massive unemployment, is contradicted by AVAS\u2019 firing approximately 3,100 people shortly after the nationalization of Rodipet.65\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 109-113.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that no specific claims have been raised by Claimants regarding the termination of the Privatization Contract on 13 July 2009.66\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 296-297.\n\n86.\n\nAccording to Respondent, while surreptitiously outsourcing Rodipet\u2019s business to other Awdi Group companies, Rodipet\u2019s employees were progressively dismissed in breach of Article 10.10 of the Privatization Contract, to be replaced by Hondurans trafficked under a plan conceived in 2008, with another company of the Awdi Group, Intelbiz Solutions, acting as intermediary. The victims were promised work permits, health insurance, and a salary of USD 300 per month for the first three months, increasing thereafter to USD 700 per month.67\n\nMotion, \u00b6 100.\n\n87.\n\nOnce in Bucharest, their passports were confiscated and they were told by Hassan Awdi personally that they would be paid USD 300 per month for the entire life of the three-year contract. Having not even been paid this miniscule salary, the Honduran victims refused to show up at the kiosks assigned to each of them on 11 October 2008, as a result of which they were paid amounts totalling USD 206, the only salary they ever received, totally insufficient to purchase food and warm clothes. They were finally liberated in an inspection by the police on 31 October 2008, their passports being recovered by the police so that they could return home.68\n\nResp. C-Mem, \u00b6 212.\n\n*c.

Magnar also provided, pursuant to Article 13.2 of the Privatization Contract, a Certificate issued on 31 May 2004 by an internal auditor and an external auditor.

[t]he truth behind [which] is explained by Rodipet\u2019s judicial administrator Mr Florea in his witness statement.\"83 The \"trick,\" as described by Cornel Florea proceeded as follows. Magnar would make payments to Rodipet\u2019s bank account. The same day, the same amounts paid would be transferred to the bank account of Mona Lisa Investments SA under a cooperation agreement signed between Rodipet and Mona Lisa.84 According to Respondent, Magnar provided auditors with a \"snapshot\" of Rodipet\u2019s accounts that showed the accounts were in good standing, so that the auditors could issue certificates to be submitted to AVAS.85\n\nC- Mem., \u00b6 92.\n\nResp.

AVAS analyzed the documents in a report of 7 May 2009, finding no reason for the Board of AVAS to change its decision of 17 May 2009. The Post-Privatization and Legal Departments prepared a joint note on 19 May 2009 and recommended maintaining the Board\u2019s decision.90 On 30 June 2009, a delegate judge ordered that AVAS be registered as shareholder of 51% of the shares of Rodipet. The Claimants appealed the order, but their appeal was rejected. Having become the majority shareholder of Rodipet, AVAS appointed C\u00e2t\u00e2lin Nitu as provisional administrator of the company. According the Respondent, Claimants refused to collaborate with C\u00e2t\u00e2lin Nitu. As a result, he filed a criminal complaint against Claimants. The financial situation of Rodipet was such that the company was declared insolvent on 16 October 2009. On 16 December 2009, Cornel Florea, of Consulta 99 SPRL, was appointed as judicial administrator of Rodipet. On 8 February 2010, AVAS appointed Vasile Uifalean to be Special Administrator of Rodipet and represent shareholders in the insolvency proceedings.91\n\nResp.

C-Mem., 299, 301-03.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent reports that currently Rodipet employs 1,771 people and has a network of 500 kiosks, which represents 35% of its kiosk network.92\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 312\n\n97.\n\nOn 30 June 2009, the date of registration of AVAS\u2019 shareholding for 51% of Rodipet\u2019s share capital, the remaining 49% was held by Magnar as to 32.99% and Yourhotel as to 15.99%.93 After the declaration of Rodipet\u2019s insolvency on 16 October 2009, Magnar was also placed in insolvency on February 2011.94 The Tribunal notes the absence of any claims by either Party regarding these developments.\n\nCl.

Respondent\u2019s Performance of its Obligations**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nUnder the Privatization Contract, Respondent had three main obligations relating to the extinction of Rodipet\u2019s debts and other liabilities, the 49-year land concession, and the transfer of shares and, subsequently, of additional shares. Respondent\u2019s performance of its obligations is best examined in a timeline fashion, against the backdrop of the legal framework in place, rather than by category of obligation.\n\n*a. The legal framework*\n------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe relevant legal framework, as reported by Respondent, consists of \"three layers of legislation.\" First is the general regime for concessions found in **Law No. 219/1998.** The law defines the maximum duration of concessions. It provides that assets found in public property of the State, county, city or village are to be allotted directly by concession agreement to the State-owned companies which administered the assets without a tender process, with royalties to be paid in a manner established in the concession agreement.95\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 109.\n\n100.\n\nSecond are special rules on concessions which concern companies that were passing from State ownership to private ownership. These rules are found in **Government Emergency Ordinance No. 88/1997** and, as implementing legislation, **Government Decision No. 577/2002.** Under Decision No. 577/2002, lands in the public domain of the State or administrative territorial units are granted directly by concession agreement for a period of 49 years with a possible extension of 24 years and 6 months to the privatized companies that hold such lands, if the lands are strictly necessary for the companies to conduct their activity. Lands in the private domain of the State or administrative territorial units that are not granted by concession are leased or sold to the company that holds them by direct negotiation without prior advertising.96\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 122; CLA-5.\n\n101.\n\nThird is a specific derogation granted to Rodipet set out in **Law 442/2004.97** The text of Law 442 provides, in part:\n\nArt. 8(1)\n\nBy derogations from the provisions of Law no. 219/1998 on the concessions, the lands that are in the State\u2019s public or private property, respectively in that of the territorial- administrative units where the sales points of \"RODIPET\" Pic. Bucharest are located, except for those located in Bucharest, will be given to it, by means of a concession contract, upon the date of this Ordinance\u2019s entry into force.\n\nArt. 8(2)\n\nThe concession is made without an Opportunity Study or a Tender Book and without a form of advertising, by direct negotiation between the transferor and the company, except for situations where the General Urbanism Plan, approved by the local authorities, imposes the change of the location with one having an identical footprint and market access.\n\nArt. 8(3)\n\nThe Concession contract is concluded for a maximum term of 49 years, with a rightful extension for a period of 24 years and 6 months if \"RODIPET\" Plc. Bucharest continues the exploitation of the land under concession for the purpose originally intended.\n\nArt. 8(4)\n\n\"RODIPET\" Plc. Bucharest benefits of direct award, by means of a Concession Contract, of the lands that are in the State\u2019s public or private property, respectively in that of the territorial-administrative units, except for those in Bucharest, where the points of sale will be placed with a view to meet the investment programme assumed by the Contract of Sale-Purchase of Shares.\n\nArt. 8(5)\n\nThe concession under this Ordinance, has, as exclusive purpose, the use by \"RODIPET\" Plc. Bucharest of the lands for the location of the points of sale in order to fulfill the object of activity and cannot be extended to other activities.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 102, C-10.\n\n*b. The performance*\n--------------------\n\n102.\n\nRespondent notes that GEO **No. 88/1997** and **Decision No. 577/2002** constituted the legal regime which governed Rodipet at the time of entry into force of the Privatization Contract.98 Respondent further notes that these legal instruments did not grant concessions but provided the framework within which the owners of the lands in question granted concessions.99 Claimants do not dispute this.100\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 115.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 115.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 123.\n\n103.\n\nOne of the first steps in Respondent\u2019s performance was, pursuant to Article 3.1 of the Privatization Contract, the publication in the Official Gazette of Government Emergency Order No. 45/2004 of 29 January 2004 (\"GEO No. 45/2004\") which extinguished the tax liabilities and other debts that Rodipet owed to the State.101\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 67, 72; Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 85; C-ll.\n\n104.\n\nOn 5 May 2004, AVAS notified Magnar of the fulfillment of the condition specified in Article 3.1.102 On 10 May 2004, AVAS notified Magnar of the change of ownership of the shares of Rodipet.103 Ten business days later, AVAS and Magnar signed an Addendum to the Privatization Contract for the transfer to Magnar of Additional Shares created through the conversion into shares of Rodipet\u2019s debts to the State.104 This fulfilled AVAS\u2019 obligation to transfer ownership of Rodipet\u2019s shares to Magnar.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 67.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 43.\n\n*Supra.* \u00b6 75.\n\n105.\n\nHowever, GEO No. 45/2004 was silent on the 49-year concession. Thus, Claimants requested an amendment of the ordinance to reflect the agreement between AVAS and Magnar under Article 3.1 of the Privatization Contract. On 28 October 2004, the Romanian Parliament enacted Law 442. According to Respondent, \"the main effect of Law 442 on Rodipet was to insert new Articles 8(l)-(5) into Government Ordinance 45/2004, creating a *sui generis* regime for Rodipet to be granted concessions over the public lands on which its kiosks stood.\"105\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 116.\n\n106.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the scope of Law 442. For Claimants, Law 442, *inter alia,* \"granted a 49-year concession (plus an additional period of 24 years and 6 months) to Rodipet to use for free the lands owned by the State and the territorial administrative units of the existing and future kiosks.\"106 According to Respondent, Law 442 did not grant any concessions but provided a legal framework for municipalities to grant concessions to Rodipet. Law 442 did not provide for rent-free concessions. The maximum duration was 49 years, implying the possibility of a shorter duration. Use of the lands was limited to the object of Rodipet\u2019s activity, *i.e.* press distribution and trade. Law 442 on Rodipet was self-executing and did not require implementing norms.107\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 69.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 119-124.\n\n107.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants explain that \"the 49-year concession was a *sine qua non* condition requested by Magnar to purchase Rodipet.... In other words, Claimants would have never invested in Rodipet without the concession.\"108 The lands where the kiosks stood were granted by agreements concluded with local authorities. The agreements differed with respect to duration, price, and legal basis. A uniform concession regime applicable nationwide was, according to Claimants, necessary to guarantee a stable and viable legal environment. Otherwise, Rodipet \"would have had to negotiate hundreds of contracts (one for each municipality) without the certainty of even being granted the use of the lands by the local mayors (footnote omitted).\"109\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 109.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 111-114.\n\n108.\n\nRespondent agrees that the reaction of the municipalities was varied. Some did not require the payment of a royalty for the concessions, but most did. In all, Rodipet concluded 150 concession contracts with the municipalities. Five municipalities challenged the constitutionality of Law 442. The first two challenges were rejected, the third and fourth challenges were upheld, and the fifth became moot. The third and fourth challenges were successful on the basis of Decision 823/2008 of 7 July 2008 and Decision 884/2008 of 10 July 2008.\n\n**B. Casa Bucur**\n-----------------\n\n109.\n\nThere are four intertwined aspects to the storyline of Casa Soare (later on referred to as Casa Bucur): one, the Romanian legal landscape concerning immovable property both during communism and after the revolution; two, the transactions surrounding Casa Soare in terms of its nationalization and subsequent privatization; three, the evolution of the restitution claim brought by the heirs to the Casa Soare estate; and four, the acquisition of Casa Bucur by Claimant EBC.\n\n110.\n\nUnder its communist regime, which lasted from 1945 to 1989, the government of Romania carried out a large-scale nationalization of privately-owned real estate properties using various measures, including Decree 92/1950 which was the general law on the nationalization of certain real estate properties.110 With respect to Casa Bucur, at the time known as Casa Oprea Soare, it was confiscated in 1950 from a Romanian citizen and placed in the patrimony of the State.111 According to Respondent, as early as 1955 and again in 1992 and 2000, Casa Bucur was declared a protected national monument.112 The Casa Bucur estate consisted of two buildings, one known as the Restaurant and the other as the Summer Kitchen.113\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 337.\n\n111.\n\nFollowing the fall of communism in 1989, Respondent started a privatization process whereby many of the confiscated properties passed to the ownership of State-owned commercial companies.114 In parallel, Respondent started a process of restitution whereby legislation was issued providing for the return of certain lands to their pre-nationalization owners.115 Respondent agrees with Claimants that these two parallel processes, which are described in greater detail in the following paragraphs, resulted in a complex legal regime that underwent multiple changes and generated political divisions in the country throughout the years as well as inconsistent court decisions.116\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 516.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 517.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 325; Cl. Mem., \u00b6 518.\n\n112.\n\nPost-revolution, for an initial period of two years from December 1989 to December 1991, Romania experienced a legal void in relation to its law on property. Law 15/1990 was the first law enacted in the privatization program.117 Later, came Law 31/1990. Essentially, these laws \"transformed the communist \u2018administration\u2019 right into a capitalist ownership right.\"118 The State organ created to manage the privatization process is what eventually became AVAS.119 Under the privatization laws, the government converted a large number of State entities into commercial entities and gave them ownership of previously State-held assets.120 Later, the government\u2019s shares in these commercial entities were themselves being offered for sale to investors.121 However, \"[g]iven the unstable legal framework created by restitution claims and special restitution legislation, warranties were granted by the Respondent to the buyers of these commercial companies in case of restitution to a former owner.\"122 This was the purpose of Law 99/1999 of 26 May 1999.123\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 566-68; CLA-177.\n\n113.\n\nIn this context, the administration of Casa Soare came to be entrusted to S.C. Alunis S.A.,124 a former socialist enterprise that was owned by AVAS. In 1990, Alunis was converted into a commercial company. From 1990 to 1999, Aluni\u00a7 granted a lease over the estate to Romanian company Casa Bucur SRL (renamed Street Comer), a company bought by Claimant EBC in November 2001, under the management of Jean Grigore.125\n\nCl.

C-Mem., \u00b6 338.\n\n114.\n\nAs early as October 1991, Dumitru Soare, whose father had commissioned the construction of Casa Soare, initiated procedures aimed at having Jean Grigore evicted from the estate.126 Dumitru Soare passed away during the pendency of his action. His two children Stefan Soare and Luciana Mott (the \"Heirs\") were allowed to pursue the claim only following the reversal of a previous decision which had found that they lacked standing. In 1994, the claim was remanded to the lower court for retrial. In September 1995, the lower court dismissed the eviction claim, indicating that the claimants needed first to establish their ownership over the estate in an action against the State.127\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 521; Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 338.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 339.\n\n115.\n\nShortly thereafter, in November 1995, Romania passed its first special enactment on the restitution of properties in the form of Law 112/1995. The Law concerned residential real estate which, like Casa Soare, had passed to State ownership based on title between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989.128\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 576; Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 326.\n\n116.\n\nUnder Law 112/1995, according to Claimants, if a property had passed into State ownership through title and was still in State ownership, its original owners could receive restitution in kind. If the properties had occupiers other than the State, the original owners had six months to file restitution claims. After six months, the current occupiers of the properties were entitled to purchase them, and the original owners were entitled to financial compensation.129 According to Respondent, Law 112/1995 allowed restitution in kind to original owners whose properties were nationalized under Decree 92/1950 through title and who continued to occupy the properties as tenants. If the tenants occupying a property were not the original owners, they were allowed to purchase the property they lived in at an advantageous price, and the original owners were eligible for financial compensation. In addition, seeking judicial relief was always an option.130\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 577-79.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 326.\n\n117.\n\nFor purposes of what constituted a \"title,\" Decree 92/1950 in itself was considered one. Therefore, takeovers that had occurred under the Decree were considered to be \"based on title.\"131 On 17 November 1998, Law 213/1998 was passed. The law required that takings done between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989 had to have been done with a valid title and in observance of the Constitution and applicable laws at the time. Goods taken by the State without a valid title could be claimed by the former owners or their successors, unless they were subject to a special legislation.132 Later on, the Supreme Court by Decision of 15 November 2005 (the \"Decision\") held that Decree 92/1950 violated the Romanian Constitution of 1948. This meant that takings done under the Decree 92/1950 would be \"without title.\"\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 578.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 580.\n\n118.\n\nWith respect to the privatization process, in 1997 and 1998, the government codified the privatization laws in Government Emergency Order (\"GEO\") 88/1997 and Government Decision 55/1998, whereby commercial companies were entitled to transfer assets in their patrimony to private companies by means of lease agreements with an irrevocable sales clause, provided a certain investment had been made.133 The Heirs made various unsuccessful attempts using different methods to stop the privatization of Aluni\u00a7 or transfer of Casa Bucur.134\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 555.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 559-562.\n\n119.\n\nOn 31 March 1999, Aluni\u00a7 and Casa Bucur SRL entered into a new five-year lease with an irrevocable sales clause, based on GEO 88/1997 and Government Decision No. 55/1998.135 At the end of the lease, Casa Bucur SRL would become the new owner of Casa Soare. However, Casa Bucur SRL purchased the estate before the end of the lease. Thus, on 25 May 1999, Casa Bucur SRL signed a Sale Purchase Agreement with Alunis to acquire the Summer Kitchen, and on 5 October 2001 a second Sale Purchase Agreement with Alunis to buy the Restaurant.136 According to Respondent, \"[d]espite the pending litigation between the Soares, Romania, Alunis and Street Comer [formerly Casa Bucur SRL] concerning ownership of Casa Soare, Alunis and Street Comer took the risk of signing an agreement (a lease containing an irrevocable sale clause) on 31 March 1999....\"137 Respondent continues, \"[b]oth parties to the agreement were fully aware that there was, at the very least, a reasonable likelihood that the Romanian courts would confirm the Soares\u2019 ownership claims over Casa Soare.\" As a result, they signed the following statement acknowledging the risk:\n\nWe are aware that the real estate property located at the abovementioned address is undergoing litigation, as it is being claimed in restitution by its former owners and we shall conclude a sale-purchase agreement by means of a real estate leasing for the real estate property located at [address of Casa Bucur] **knowing that it is subject to dispute and accepting the risks deriving therefrom.138**\n\nCl.

SRL acquired 87,095% of the share capital of Alunis by public auction for EUR 146,203.139 Mona Lisa Trading Company SRL was another investment vehicle incorporated by Claimants.140 According to Respondent, Casa Soare figured in the tender documents as \"immovable goods claimed by other.\"141 At the auction, the chairman of the commission notified bidders that Casa Bucur was subject to restitution litigation, stating, according to Claimants and Respondent \"there is a litigation for the revendication of the estate BUCUR RESTAURANT between SC ALUNIS SA and Mr. STEFAN SOARE and Mrs. IO ANA MOTT.\"142\n\nCl.

On 17 October 2001, Claimant EBC acquired Casa Bucur SRL (or Street Comer). On 29 October 2001, Claimants incorporated the company Alfa El Romania SRL, its sole shareholder being Alfa El Corporation, one of the Claimants.143 On 21 February 2002, Alfa El Romania SRL entered into a Sale Purchase Agreement with Casa Bucur SRL (now owned by EBC) to purchase the Casa Bucur estate from Casa Bucur SRL for approximately EUR 554,800.144 Alfa El Romania SRL later changed its name to Alfa El Bucur SRL.

With some exceptions, restitution in kind became the default under the new law and, when it was impossible, remedies such as financial compensation were provided.149 Claims had to be filed within six months of the entry into force of the law. Law 10/2001 distinguished between property held by companies where the State or a State entity is the majority shareholder, and property held by already privatized commercial entities. In the first case, the property\u2019s restitution in kind was required. In the second case, where the taking was based on a valid title, no restitution in kind was provided, rather compensation was required.150\n\nCLA-188.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 329.\n\nCl.

However, this did not affect properties transferred to commercial companies subsequently privatized since the ownership did not result from the privatization procedure.153 The Heirs\u2019 claim having been rejected both by the Bucharest District Court and Court of Appeals, it came to the Supreme Court in 2005.154\n\nCl.

At the time of the signature of the Privatization Contract none of the Claimants had any stake in Magnar, the owners being Marwan Georges Matly (30%), Nayef Kamal Abboud (30%) and Bassan Raymond Instambouly (40%).161\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 398, with reference to the Trade Registry History of Magnar (R-93).\n\n130.\n\nHassan Awdi acquired a 1% interest in Magnar in February 2004, 96% in Magnar being at that time transferred to Mona Lisa, a company in which Hassan Awdi held a 10% interest, the controlling shareholder with 89% of the share capital being his wife, Wafa Hikmat Awdi.162 Only on 25 April 2007 did Street Comer, a company owned at that time by Claimant EBC, become the sole shareholder in Magnar.163\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 398, with reference to the Trade Registry History of Mona Lisa (R-264).\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 398, with reference to the Trade Registry History of Magnar (R-93).\n\n131.\n\nStill according to Respondent, on 30 August 2004, Magnar owned 96% shareholding of Rodipet, the rest being held by Supremo, Mona Lisa, Mehdi Awdi, and Hassan Awdi. Magnar\u2019s interest in Rodipet dropped to 54% in early 2005 and to 23% on 25 July 2006, the date on which the Ministry of Public Finance acquired 55% of Rodipet\u2019s share capital.164 On 23 March 2007, Magnar\u2019s interest which amounted to 83% of the share capital of Rodipet, dropped to 77 *%* at the time of execution of the Pledge.165\n\nResp. C-Mem., n.740, with reference to the Trade Registry History of Rodipet (R-101).\n\nResp. C-Mem.\n\n132.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 contention that for jurisdictional purposes the only relevant time under the ICSID Convention is the date of consent to arbitration is incorrect. There must be in fact a convergence in time between ownership, breach and damage, as held by other investment treaty cases, such as *Daimler* v. *Argentina, Saluka* v. *Czech Republic* or *ConocoPhilipps* v. *Venezuela.*166 Thus, according to Respondent, Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations can only arise at the time the investment was made, in the case of Rodipet in 2007, the date of 2007 being also important when considering the investor\u2019s good faith at the time it made its alleged investment.167\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 343.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 344.\n\n133.\n\nFor Respondent, Claimants presented a new case on \"investment\" in their Reply which, being belated, should be ignored by the Tribunal. According to the new case, Claimants\u2019 investment would consist in the acquisition of Rodipet, the substantial sums of money invested in accordance with the Privatization Contract and the comprehensive and expensive reorganization program for the renovation, modernization and expansion of Rodipet\u2019s infrastructure, logistical and distribution capacities as well as developing the local workforce.\n\n134.\n\nNo attempt was made by Claimants to explain why these alleged new investments would come within the definition of \"investment\" in Article l(l)(a) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. These alleged investments are unsupported by any evidence in terms of financing by Claimants. In relation to the various transactions to which Claimants were parties, Respondent\u2019s request for document production of 19 July 2013 was not met, Claimants alleging not to dispose of any of the requested documents. According to Respondent, this is preposterous, Hassan Awdi being personally a party to some of the transactions and the sole shareholder of corporate Claimants EBC and Alfa El Corporation. The truth is that nothing was paid for in return for an interest in Street Comer or in Magnar, the latter owning a majority stake in Rodipet which in turn was allegedly worth in the region between EUR 97 and 223 million.168\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 358 (with reference to Table 1 of the report of Gervase MacGregor, Claimants\u2019 *quantum* expert).\n\n135.\n\nThe same applies to investments allegedly made in acquiring Casa Soare and to purchase the shareholding in Street Comer or Alfa El Romania, for which EBC and respectively Alfa El Corporation paid nothing.\n\n136.\n\nThe obvious inference to be drawn by the Tribunal is that there has been no capital contribution or commitment by Claimants in their so-called investment in Romania, in view also of the requirement that there must be some economic link between a capital contribution and the purported investor enabling the Tribunal to find that a given investment is an investment of that particular investor.169 Bare shareholding in itself cannot be considered as an investment, what it required is a real active contribution, otherwise no investment will exist.170 The Tribunal is therefore requested to dismiss jurisdiction in view of Claimants\u2019 paper investment without any proven capital contribution to the Romanian companies involved.171\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 361, with reference to *Malicorp* v. *Egypt.* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, \u00b6 113 (RLA-26), and to *Caratube International Oil Company* v. *Republic of Kazakhstan.* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12. Award, 5 June 212, \u00b6 355 (CLA-338).\n\nRPHB., \u00b6 14.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 363.\n\n137.\n\nRespondent essentially considers that the Awdi Group established a smokescreen behind which it organized a \"dizzying carousel of transactions\" the aim of which was to strip Rodipet of its business and assets.172 In Respondent\u2019s view, this case is one of divestment rather than investment.173 Respondent considers that the various enterprises involved on Claimants\u2019 side in the case were organized in the nature of a family affair, but they also point out that Hassan Awdi must not be considered as the \"master puppet\" who would control all operations.174\n\nResp. C. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 148-212.\n\nRPHB., \u00b6 23.\n\nRPHB., \u00b6 29.\n\n138.\n\nClaimants have made no \"contribution\" in the sense that there was no injection of money. No evidence was presented to support the allegation of a comprehensive and expensive reorganization of Rodipet, and the alleged investment pursuant to the Privatization Contract in reality were bogus accounting tricks.175 No evidence was produced to show that Claimants made any payment for the purchase of Rodipet, for the transfer of Magnar shares to Street Comer, for the purchase of Alfa El Romania or for Casa Bucur.176 It is true, according to Respondent, that Magnar paid a purchase price to AVAS for the shares in Rodipet and also made capital injections. But Claimants held, at most, a small minority of shares in Magnar, and it cannot be assumed that capital injections came from Claimants. Moreover, the five capital increases to Magnar, cited by Claimants, are not relevant. The auditor\u2019s certificate for the Fourth Year was based on a bogus transaction. In hindsight, even the earlier payments look suspicious, and Respondent does not accept that they were really made.177\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 351, 353.\n\nResp. Answers, \u00b6 15.\n\nRPHB., \u00b6 17.\n\n139.\n\nWith regard to documents made available, Claimants failed to disclose documents related to their \"contribution\" both as regards Rodipet and Casa Bucur. An adverse inference must therefore be drawn.178 Also, Respondent argues that Claimants have presented an explanation of their \"investment\" only in their Reply, and that their claim is therefore inadmissible.179\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 360.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 348.\n\n140.\n\nAs to debt forgiveness as \"contributions,\" Claimants\u2019 assertions are not proven, and it is nonsensical to argue that the Privatization Contract itself was a \"contribution.\" Claimants were neither Party to the Privatization Contract nor shareholders of Magnar at the relevant time. Personal guarantees, loans, and associated collateral cited by Claimants did not have the character of contributions, but were part of the scheme to loot Rodipet. The same is true for cash investments by Magnar and Balbek Tourism in Rodipet. The circulation of money alone does not prove a capital contribution; the purpose here was to withdraw money and assets from Rodipet.180 Know-how and managerial skills were used not to make a \"contribution\" but to strip Rodipet of its assets.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.\n\n141.\n\nHassan Awdi\u2019s claim of measures affecting Rodipet may only be made regarding actions taking place after February 2004 limited to 10.6% of any damages resulting from such measures and perhaps make a claim only as an alternative to EBC for events after 25 April 2007. EBC could perhaps make a claim after 25 April 2007 as an alternative to Hassan Awdi\u2019s claim.181\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 399.\n\n142.\n\nRegarding Rodipet, Respondent additionally contends that Claimants\u2019 claims, even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction over them, would be inadmissible because of the investors\u2019 lack of good faith and because granting them the BIT\u2019s protection would be against the civil law maxim of *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans.*\n\n143.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants failed to act in good faith in their dealings with Romania and in addition acted against internationally recognized workers\u2019 rights and the well-being of Rodipet\u2019s employees.\n\n144.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants never had any intention to fulfil their obligations under the Privatization Contract, their aim being to loot by financially exploiting and misusing Rodipet and, further, by adopting a reprehensive scheme to lure unsuspecting Hondurans to Romania to be used as forced labor in Rodipet\u2019s kiosks, while reducing the number of Rodipet\u2019s own employees.182\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 426-428.\n\n145.\n\nAccording to Respondent, good faith is a principle of international law that in some circumstances, like the present ones, prevent rights, and claims based on those rights, that would otherwise exist from arising. As to the value of the reference in the BIT Preamble to the contribution to well-being of workers and promotion of the respect for internationally recognized worker rights, which is disputed by Claimants, preambles matter in the context of good faith and admissibility.183 The intention of the States Parties to the BIT was indeed to exclude from its protection investors who invested and operated their investments in bad faith or with the deliberate intent of breaching international workers\u2019 rights.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 394.\n\n146.\n\nThe effect of a finding of lack of good faith in the making of the investment or making the same contrary to the aims of the BIT is to deprive the investor of the rights under the treaty. But there is another admissibility issue since Claimants are trying to benefit from their own illegal acts consisting in the looting of Rodipet of its assets and cash, causing it to collapse, through surreptitious transactions by which such assets and parts of the business were transferred to other companies of Hassan Awdi and his associates.\n\n147.\n\nThe admissibility objections are based on international law, not Romanian law. It is therefore not required that breach of criminal law be found for the claims to be inadmissible. Good faith in business dealings is also required by Romanian law being a core concept of international public policy. It is in fact one of the fundamental mandatory provisions in UNIDROIT principles of international commercial contracts (Article 1.7).\n\n148.\n\nSimilar was the story with the Hondurans, Magnar having represented during the privatization negotiations that it considered Rodipet\u2019s workforce as a strength, accepting to maintain the number of employees at pre-privatization level. Hassan Awdi had no qualms in disclosing his real opinion when stating that Rodipet\u2019s employees *\"were not necessary or useful to the operation of the businessC\"184* The outcome was the progressive firing or forced transfer of employees to other companies of the Awdi Group.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Hassan Awdi, \u00b6 25.\n\n149.\n\nThis led to a shortage of manpower at Rodipet which had to be filled by recruiting through Intelbiz, another company of the group, Hondurans to come to Romania with the promise to work in Rodipet kiosks. However, their passports were confiscated and no work permits provided. This, to save money since Hondurans were paid less than local workers while keeping them in a precarious situation since they could not leave or complain. However, they reacted seeking police assistance, which was provided. The fact that the Bucharest Criminal Tribunal did not find this conduct to rise to the level of human trafficking for forced labour means nothing, this conduct being contrary to international law standards in addition to breaching domestic law.185\n\nSuch as GEO No. 56/2007, as found by the Bucharest Tribunal by Decision dated 23 April 2013 (C-509).\n\n150.\n\nContrary to Claimants\u2019 allegation, Respondent is not prevented or estopped from raising the illegality of the investment by failure to react to the seriousness of the illegality despite knowledge of the same. This could not be done before Claimants\u2019 treaty rights would have arisen, what could only occur once a claim for such rights is made, in other words in the present proceedings.\n\n151.\n\nAVAS could only react when sufficient evidence of breaches of the Privatization Contract had occurred, which could not happen before 2008 when significant action was taken against Magnar by legally calling the Pledge and terminating the Privatization Contract. As to the criminal side, it is difficult to claim that DIICOT did not react to the suspected illegalities.\n\n152.\n\nAlfa El Corporation\u2019s claim falls outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction having no investment in Rodipet or Magnar. Regarding the alleged investment in Alfa El Romania, the owner of Casa Soare, a distinction is to be made between the period since 21 February 2002186 when Alfa El Romania, being owned by Alfa El Corporation, acquired Casa Soare and the period when changes were made to its ownership structure with Mona Lisa Trading becoming the majority owner at various stages during 2007-2008 until when, on 21 April 2008, Alfa El Corporation became the owner of nearly the entire share capital of Alfa El Romania, at the time when Casa Soare) had been restituted to the Soare family.\n\nPrior to 21 February 2002 Casa Soare was owned by Street Comer, a company bought by Claimant EBC only in November 2001: Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 401.\n\n153.\n\nAsa result, Hassan Awdi could make a claim regarding Casa Soare through either Alfa El Corporation or presumably his 10% interest in Mona Lisa. No such claim has however been articulated. EBC would have a claim for events taking place after November 2001 but none of the actions complained of are alleged to have impacted EBC\u2019s investment in Romania, thus falling outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Alfa El USA may have a claim in the alternative to Hassan Awdi to the extent it shows ownership at relevant times and the monetary impact this had on its investment.187 Respondent considers that no claim exists against the State, and that the claim should be raised vis-\u00e0-vis Street Comer as the seller of Casa Soare.188\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 402.\n\nResp. C. Mem., \u00b6 668.\n\n154.\n\nAccording to Respondent, since Claimants elected to make their complaints regarding restitution of Casa Soare before the Romanian courts they are prevented from bringing the same dispute before this Tribunal by the fork-in-the-road provision under Article Vl.2-3(a) of the BIT. No \"triple identity test\" may be relied upon to exclude the application of this provision since such test, developed in the context of *res iudicata,* is not applicable, as held by other investment treaty tribunals, and considering further that the case was brought before local courts by a subsidiary that Hassan Awdi considers as his *alter ego.189*\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 412.\n\n155.\n\nClaimants\u2019 objections to the fork-in-the-road provision is based on their claim that the cause of action in the Romanian proceedings was not the BIT and that the fork was not taken since \"the relevant proceedings never commenced\" and in any case would have failed. As to the first objection, Respondent notes that Claimants relied on the BIT\u2019s expropriation provision to request damages for the alleged expropriation of Casa Soare. As to the second objection, it is sufficient for the test to apply that the dispute be submitted to the local courts by lodging the claim with the court register, as it was the case for the two claims filed by Alfa El Romania.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n156.\n\nIn reply to Respondent\u2019s contentions, Claimants assert that from the time of privatization until the execution of the Pledge, in June 2009, Magnar was owned, directly or indirectly, by Hassan Awdi, and members of his family. One percent interest in Magnar was acquired in February 2004 by each of Hassan and Mehdi Awdi, while 96% interest was held by Mona Lisa, a company also owned by Hassan Awdi and his wife, Wafa Awdi.190\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 20. The remaining shares were held by Bassam Raymond Instambouly (1%) and Marian Georges Matly (1%), Trade Registry History of Magnar (R-93).\n\n157.\n\nClaimants refute that they have presented their views on the requirements of investment too late.191 It was Respondent who set forth a new case in their Rejoinder, and Claimants only had the opportunity to respond in their Answer to the Tribunal\u2019s Question. Claimants\u2019 view was consistent starting from the Request of Arbitration.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 16.\n\n158.\n\nDuring the performance of the Privatization Contract and before Law 442 was declared unconstitutional and the Pledge enforced, on 25 April 2007, Street Comer, a company wholly owned by Claimant EBC, became sole shareholder of Magnar.192\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 20. EBC is and has always been wholly owned by Hassan Awdi: Reply, n.7, with reference to C-4.\n\n159.\n\nAll four conditions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction are met since:\n\na) The dispute is \"legal\" since it concerns Romania\u2019s multiple violations of its obligations under the BIT and the Privatization Contract and the relief to be granted to Claimants as a result of these violations;\n\nb) The dispute arises directly out of Claimants\u2019 direct and indirect investments in various companies in Romania, including Rodipet, engaged in a comprehensive reorganization program and invested millions of dollars in acquiring Casa Soare and transforming it into a landmark tourist destination;\n\nc) The dispute is between two companies, EBC and Alfa El Corporation and one natural person, Hassan Awdi, all of US nationality, and Romania, both US and Romania being contracting States to the ICSID Convention;\n\nd) The Parties have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration according to Article VI of the BIT, Romania under paragraph 4 of such Article and Claimants by consenting to ICSID arbitration pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article VI in their letters to Romania of 8 December 2008, 5 January 2010, and 19 January 2010.193 Claimants\u2019 consent was reiterated in the Request for Arbitration.194\n\nLetters from Awdi Group to Romania, C-24, C-25 and C-26, respectively.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 32.\n\n160.\n\nIt is well established that for jurisdictional purposes the only relevant time under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is the date of consent to arbitration which, in the case of a BIT, is the date on which the investor accepted the offer to arbitration made by the host State and on which the proceedings are instituted.195\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 40.\n\n161.\n\nAs to individual Claimants\u2019 claims in respect to each investment, Hassan Awdi and EBC, being indirectly owners of Rodipet, invested in Rodipet and have been affected by the actions of Romania while Claimant Alfa El Corporation invested in Casa Soare and has a claim in that regard.196\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 42.\n\n162.\n\nClaimants state that the requirements of an \"investment\" are met by its business in Romania, both in regard to the BIT and in regard to Article. 25 of the ICSID Convention. Concerning the BIT, Claimants points to the definition of an investment under Article 1(a).197 As to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, Claimants refer to the *Salini* criteria which have been accepted by ICSID tribunals as typical characteristics of investments under the Convention. The Tribunal should take into consideration when deciding on the existence of an investment only three *Salini* criteria: duration, contribution and risk. In support of this view, Claimants cite jurisprudence of ICSID Tribunals.198 As to duration199 and risk,200 no doubt exists that these are present in Claimants\u2019 business operations.\n\nCl.

Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n163.\n\nClaimants made numerous contributions (monetary and non-monetary) to Rodipet: (i) the initial purchase of Rodipet\u2019s shares by Magnar, (ii) the long-term performance of the Privatization Contract, (iii) share capital increases, (iv) further capital injections pursuant to the Privatization Contract, (v) additional investments, (vi) knowhow, management and other immaterial contributions.201\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 21.\n\n164.\n\nAs regards to investments actually made, Claimants purchased the shares through Magnar, a company he controlled completely and of which he was majority owner, indirectly and together with his wife. The meager price of about EUR 1.6 million reflected the debt forgiven by Magnar to Supremo, owned by Hassan Awdi, a huge economic contribution in itself.202 Had the debt been enforced, Rodipet would almost certainly have fallen into bankruptcy.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 22.\n\n165.\n\nHassan Awdi owned and controlled Magnar in 2004. Claimants\u2019 vision of Rodipet and its network was that of the pillar of a broader business. Claimant initially invested in Rodipet, but Claimants\u2019 business grew over time, and it was carried out by several companies focussing on different aspects of the Rodipet operations.203 The Rodipet Group companies were all interlinked and dependent on each other, and they were set up to accomplish the same economic activity, even though they were not an accounting group.204 As not disputed by Respondent,205 Hassan Awdi controlled Rodipet well before 2007; even a minority shareholding amounts to an investment.206\n\nCPHB., \u00b6 63.\n\nCPHB., \u00b6 65.\n\nCPHB., \u00b6 30.\n\nCPHB., \u00b6 30.\n\n166.\n\nIn this context, Claimants cite *LETCO* v. *Liberia* stating that there is \"effective control\" when a minority shareholding \"dominated the company decision-making structure.\"207 The decision in *Sedelmayer* v. *Russia* also supports the view that Hassan Awdi controlled Magnar through which he made investments.208 Claimants refer in the same context also to *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan.209*\n\nCPHB., \u00b6 32.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 33.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 22, n.97.\n\n167.\n\nClaimants did not apply an accounting trick when it made its payments;210 in this context, sequence of payments, legal ground of payments, and the reason for the symmetry of payments must be taken into account. Also, as Claimants controlled all companies involved, any \"trick\" would have affected all the companies. A second investment was the Privatization Contract itself. Major contributions were to be made under the Privatization Contract which Claimants in fact performed for almost six years.211\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 19 *et seq.*\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 24.\n\n168.\n\n*Malicorp* v. *Egypt* does not support Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimants made no contribution as that decision states that a contract implies an obligation to make a contribution in the future.212 Altogether, the capital share increases by Magnar amounted to nearly USD 5 million. Conversion of Rodipet\u2019s debt into Supremo\u2019s shares has to be recognized in this context,213 as this forgiveness had an economic value to Rodipet. ICSID tribunals have agreed that contributions may take many forms as long as they occur in the context of an economic policy.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 24.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 37.\n\n169.\n\nThird, the Claimants contributed by capital share increases, by way of allocating money and by converting debt into shares.214 It was irrelevant here that investments in shares were made by an intermediate company as recognized by arbitral jurisprudence.215 In 2004, when Magnar paid about EUR 1.6 million, Hassan Awdi was the direct owner of 1% of the shares; together with his wife Wafa Awdi he owned 76,82%, indirectly through the company Mona Lisa. Given the applicable Muslim Shiite matrimonial law, Hassan Awdi was the majority owner.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 25.\n\nCl.

Answers, \u00b6 40.\n\n171.\n\nSixth, Hassan Awdi provided personal guarantees for loans of Rodipet, and companies of his group provided their assets as collateral.218 Loans amount to investments for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, as is recognised by ICSID tribunals. Finally, seventh, Hassan Awdi contributed his knowhow and management skills to Rodipet and related businesses. Personnel and services of other companies of his group did the same, and a plan for the modernisation and expansion of Rodipet arose out of these activities.219\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 41.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 42.\n\n172.\n\nIn general, Claimants\u2019 entire investment has to be assessed through the prism of the Rodipet Group as a whole.220 To make a viable company out of Rodipet, Claimants had no other choice but to involve other companies of their group.\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 4.\n\n173.\n\nThe Rodipet Group was a \"family business,\" revolving around Hassan Awdi, as stated by Respondent. Claimants\u2019 practice to involve other companies is customary in ventures of this kind and its activities were completely business-oriented. Respondent\u2019s persistent effort to cast doubt on the integrity of Claimants\u2019 business is baseless.\n\n174.\n\nAs to Casa Bucur, Claimants refer to Alfa El Bucur\u2019s previous claim of USD 500,000 for acquisition and EUR 5,000,000 for works performed on Casa Bucur (alternatively, according to a report by Dr. Eng. Tache Parvelescu USD 3,167,567).221\n\nCPHB., \u00b6\u00b6 101 *et seq.*\n\n175.\n\nThe claims arising from the expropriation of Casa Soare fall within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause contained in Article VI.2-3 of the BIT, relied upon by Respondent, being not applicable. No parallel may be drawn between the situation in the present case and that which existed in the *Pantechniki* case referred to by Respondent since Claimants assert valid treaty claims before the Tribunal based on the illegal taking of Casa Soare by a decision amounting to a denial of justice and the failure to pay compensation in breach of the BIT.222\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 627.\n\n176.\n\nAs held by other investment treaty tribunals, in order for the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause to preclude claims to be considered by a tribunal, it is to be considered whether the same claim is \"on a different road\" based on the triple identity test: same object, parties, and cause of action.223\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 629-630 and cases cited therein.\n\n177.\n\nApplying this test to the facts of this case, the causes of action in this arbitration are the breaches of the BIT obligations by Respondent. Breach of Article III of the BIT was not the cause of action brought by Alfa El Romania before Romanian courts, the action in the Romanian courts being based on Romanian law, the brief mention of Article III being made as mere supporting evidence of the guarantees made by Respondent to investor in general.\n\n178.\n\nIn any case, there is no identity of the parties in the two proceedings. Respondent\u2019s contention that Alfa El Romania which brought the claims for compensation before the Romanian courts is the same as Alfa El Corporation, its majority shareholders, or as Hassan Awdi as his *alter ego* is rejected by investment treaty cases, the test for identity of the parties being confined to identical legal persons.224\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 641.\n\n179.\n\nIf Respondent relies on an alleged failure to exhaust local remedies to found a jurisdictional objection, suffice it to remember that, pursuant to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, such requirement has to be explicitly imposed as a condition in the relevant instrument, no such requirement being mentioned in the BIT.\n\n180.\n\nRegarding Respondent\u2019s admissibility objections, Claimants assert that in legitimate reliance on the contractual and already pending legislative guarantees, including forgiveness of Rodipet\u2019s debts to public bodies and the granting of a rent-free concession, they invested heavily in Rodipet. Their aim was not to loot Rodipet of its assets, in spite of Respondent\u2019s allegation. The Awdi Group even offered its assets as security to obtain the financing necessary for the expansion of Rodipet in view of the latter\u2019s difficult financial status at the time of privatization.\n\n181.\n\nIt is not in dispute that while under State ownership Rodipet accumulated significant debt, both to its suppliers and to the State, as well as other liabilities. This situation was caused by decreased cash flow due to its low recovery of receivables and payment of debts that did not ensure sufficient liquidity to carry out its business. At the time of privatization, Rodipet was incurring monthly losses between three and seven billion Lei, as recognized by the Competition Council\u2019s Decision regarding state aid to be granted to Rodipet,225and by the Substantiation Report contained in the Project Ordinance for finalizing the privatization of Rodipet by AVAS.226\n\nDecision of the Competition Council dated 29 May 2006, (C-50, \u00b6 2.3).\n\nProject Ordinance, page 3 (C-468).\n\n182.\n\nThe Privatization Contract imposed various obligations on Magnar, some of which prevented Magnar from taking measures to turn Rodipet into a profitable company until the end of the five year period from the transfer of shares. A minimum of 70% of the company\u2019s turn over had to be derived from the company\u2019s main activity, being retail sale of newspapers, books, and stationary product.227 Modification of the main activity was prohibited within the first five years228 and a minimum of 3,127 job positions had to be maintained,229 well in excess of what was actually needed to carry on Rodipet\u2019s business. The location of existing kiosks could not be changed and if 5% or more of them were closed, they should have been replaced.230\n\nPrivatization Contract, Article 10.6 (C-7).\n\nPrivatization Contract, Article 10.5 (C-7)\n\nPrivatization Contract, Articles 10.9 and 9.8.1 and Appendix N. 4, Article 8 (C-7).\n\nPrivatization Contract, Article 17.6 (C-7).\n\n183.\n\nAgainst this background, Respondent\u2019s theory that Claimants\u2019 intent *\"from the beginning'* was *\"to find cash-rich companies and strip them of their assets\"231* is a flimsy-case construction.232 According to Respondent, Claimants instituted *\"a dizzying carousel of transactions - loans, leases sub-leases, sales, mortgages, service agreements, etc. - the underlying aim of which was to strip Rodipet of its business and assets.\"233*\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 426.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 63.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 148.\n\n184.\n\nThe reality was much different according to Claimants. Due to its woeful financial situation at the time of Magnar\u2019s acquisition, Rodipet could not obtain loans from banks. To increase cost-efficiency and revenue generating potential of Rodipet\u2019s different businesses, Claimants implemented a restructuring plan, which was provided to AVAS on 26 April 2006, approved and submitted by the latter to the Competition Council in the context of the latter\u2019s approval of state aid to be granted to Rodipet.234\n\nDecision of the Competition Council dated 29 May 2006, (C-5O,\u00b6 24).\n\n185.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s assertions in support of its objection to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims that the criminal investigations against Hassan Awdi and his associates show the intent \"to *plunder [Rodipet\u2019s assets] through a simple criminal scheme\"* through the alleged *\"systematic looting of Rodipet\u2019s assets and business\"235* and *\"trafficking humans for the purpose of forced labour\"236* and similar accusations all remain unproven.237\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 156 *et seq.*\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 202.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 67, pointing to the \"complete acquittals\" of the charge of *\"human trafficking.\"*\n\n186.\n\nRespondent asks the Tribunal to declare that Claimants\u2019 claims are inadmissible because their investments were \"illegal\" and made in \"bad faith\" based on criminal accusations. Respondent\u2019s inadmissibility objections should be decided summarily by the Tribunal by ruling that the same is inadmissible.238\n\nMotion, \u00b6 12.\n\n187.\n\nRespondent relies on the criminal proceedings to prove the illegality of Claimants\u2019 investment and render their claims inadmissible. It is a cardinal principle of customary international law that \"Disputing Parties each owed in this arbitration a general legal duty to the other and to the Tribunal to conduct themselves in good faith...,\"239 One facet of this good faith obligation in international law is the principle of estoppel, according to which States must not be allowed to change their prior conduct to the detriment of those who have reasonably relied on it.240\n\nMotion, \u00b6 20, citing *Methanex Corporation* v. *United States of America.* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 August 2005, Part II, Chapter I, \u00b6 54 (CPM-102).\n\nMotion, \u00b6 21, citing *Philippe Gruslin* v. *Malaysia.* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/3, Award, 27 November 2000, \u00b6 20.2 (CLA-281).\n\n188.\n\nApplying this requirement to the present case, Respondent\u2019s statement relied upon by Claimants is to be found in Respondent\u2019s Response on Provisional Measures (at para. 44) that *\"this arbitration is not about the existence or not of criminal liability by Mr Hassan Awdi or his associates and the investigated persons have the right to the presumption of innocence in the on-going criminal investigations in Romania\"* Claimants have conducted and prepared their entire case, relying on Respondent\u2019s representations.\n\n189.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s objection to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claim based as it is on the criminal charges pressed against Hassan Awdi would, if met, be against Respondent\u2019s obligation to respect the presumption of innocence to be accorded Hassan Awdi which, according to the ECtHR\u2019s jurisprudence, extends to non-criminal proceedings.241\n\nMotion, \u00b6 53.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nAccording to Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention, the date that applies regarding the investor\u2019s nationality requirement depends on whether the investor is: (a) a natural person, in which case it must have the nationality of the State other than the State party to the dispute both on the date of consent to submit the dispute to arbitration and on the date the request for arbitration is registered and the proceedings instituted, or (b) a juridical person, in which case the nationality requirement relates only to the date of consent. Likewise, all other jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention and the BIT must be met on the date of institution of the proceedings.242\n\nRudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law, 2012, p. 38.\n\n191.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration was registered on 16 June 2010 and the proceedings instituted on the same date,243 following consent to arbitration by the individual Claimants on 8 December 2009, 5 January 2010, and 19 January 2010.244 Each of the Claimants was a national of the United States of America on all the above dates.245 This has not been disputed by Respondent. ICSID jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence *ratione personae* are therefore established.\n\nICSID Letter of 19 January 2011 to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\nLetters from each of the Claimants to Romania, C-24, C-25 and C-26, respectively.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8 and 10.\n\n192.\n\nRegarding jurisdiction *\"ratione materiae\"* a distinction is to be made between Claimants\u2019 investments in Rodipet and those in Casa Bucur. Regarding Rodipet, according to Claimants, at the time of institution of these proceedings: (a) Claimants Hassan Awdi and EBC had made investments in Rodipet through Magnar,246 a company (i) which had during the relevant time a share participation in Rodipet247 and (ii) in which Hassan Awdi had during the relevant time a share participation directly and/or through Supremo, Mona Lisa, Piramid and Street Comer,248 the latter being companies in which Hassan Awdi had a share participation, either directly or indirectly249 Regarding Casa Bucur, Claimant Hassan Awdi had made investments in Alfa El Romania, owner of Casa Bucur (or Casa Soare), through his 100% ownership by Claimant Alfa El Corporation, the latter owning 99.99% shares in Alfa El Romania during the relevant time.250\n\nClaimants allege that investments in Rodipet were made by Magnar and in part by Supremo through capital increases for the amounts and on the dates (in 2004 and 2005) indicated in Cl. Answers, for a total of RON 22,449,285 (EUR 5,864,220) (see table in para. 6 of the Cl. Answers). An additional cash investment for RON 10,278,985 (EUR 2,924,774) is alleged by Claimants to have been made by Magnar and Baalbeck Tourism during the period from 27 May 2005 to 9 January 2008 (Cl. Answers, para. 7 and relevant table). Claimants additionally claim to have invested in Rodipet in 2004-2008 through other companies of the Rodipet Group at least EUR 10,927,168 (Cl. Answers, paras 11-15).\n\nAppendix A to Cl. Answers. No significant objections to the Appendixes to Cl. Answers have been raised by Respondent: RPHB, \u00b6 13 and n.ll.\n\nAppendix B to Cl. Answers.\n\nAppendixes C, F, I and K to Cl. Answers.\n\nAppendix J to Cl. Answers.\n\n193.\n\nUnder Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT, \"investment in the territory of one Party may be owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party.\" Since the date of Magnar\u2019s acquisition of 100% of Rodipet\u2019s shares, *i.e 26* May 2004, Hassan Awdi controlled indirectly each of the companies that invested in Rodipet through Magnar, although with varied percentage shareholdings depending on the date of each investment.251\n\nAppendix A to Cl. Answers.\n\n194.\n\nThis includes the period from 25 May 2006 to 12 September 2005 and from 15 November 2006 until 25 April 2007 during which shareholding in Magnar was held by large majority through Mona Lisa,252 a company in which Hassan Awdi\u2019s wife, Wafa Awdi, held a share participation ranging from 89.9% to 70.01% and her husband a share participation ranging from 10% to 10.02%.253 Although these various periods of time are not relevant for jurisdiction purposes, in view of the position expressed by Respondent denying that Hassan Awdi controlled Mona Lisa,254 the Tribunal deems useful to note the following. As correctly mentioned by Claimants and not denied by Respondent,255 majority shareholders, minority shareholders and indirect shareholders can bring investment treaty claims, obviously within the limits of their shareholding. Thus, to the extent it owned a shareholding in Mona Lisa at the time of cancellation of Law 442 and of the enforcement of the Pledge, Hassan Awdi would be entitled, should Respondent\u2019s liability be found, to claim compensation. As held by other investment treaty tribunals, \"control\" may also be a *\"de facto\"* control whenever it is clearly shown that a minority shareholder *\"dominated the company decision- making structure.\"256*\n\nAppendix B to Cl. Answers.\n\nAppendix J to Cl. Answers.\n\nResp. C.-Mem\" \u00b6398; Resp. Answers, \u00b6 18.\n\nCl. Rep., n.24; RPHB, \u00b6 9.\n\n*Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation [LETCO]* v. *Republic of Liberia.* ICSID Case No. ARB/83/2, Award, 31 March 1986, p. 4, referred to in CPHB, n.9O; *supra.* \u00b6 164 (CLA-155).\n\n195.\n\nThat this was the case of Hassan Awdi \"control\" of Mona Lisa is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, beyond doubt. Not only was Hassan Awdi the one that had conceived and promoted the project regarding Rodipet since July 1999257 but throughout the project acquisition and implementation, directly and through the various companies in which he held a share participation, Hassan Awdi was clearly in control of the entire project. Mona Lisa was just one of the companies which, as shown by documents in the file, always intervened for implementing a scheme designed by Hassan Awdi. The fact that, as noted by Respondent,258 Wafa Awdi signed certain documents on behalf of Mona Lisa detracts nothing from this conclusion, the company having in any case to act through whoever represents it formally *vis-\u00e0-vis* third parties.\n\nLetter to AVAS signed by Hassan Awdi for Bueno Corporation dated 27 July 1999 (C-32).\n\nReference by Respondent to contracts signed by Wafa Awdi for Mona Lisa (RPHB, \u00b6 28) is therefore inapposite.\n\n196.\n\nOne of the \"key documents\" mentioned by Respondent to refute the *de facto* control by Hassan Awdi of Mona Lisa, the \"collaboration contract\" with Magnar, shows that Wafa Awdi did what her husband told her to do as Mona Lisa. The \"collaboration contract\" in question was in fact part of the so-called \"money carousel\" (or \"accounting trick\") by which, according to Respondent, Magnar would have tried to lead AVAS to believe that it had fulfilled the investment obligation for the 4th Year. The \"collaboration contract\" between Mona Lisa and Magnar dated 15 November 2006 was only a piece of a more complex scheme made of different steps259 in which other companies of the Awdi Group were involved, including Rodipet. The latter had signed on 8 November 2006 with Magnar a \"collaboration contract,\" the text of which was near-identical to that of the Magnar-Mona Lisa contract signed one week later, Mona Lisa being the final payee of \"undue amounts\" from Rodipet. According to Respondent, this \"money carousel\" would have been a way of consummating what it considers an \"accounting trick\" to defraud AVAS. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, what would have been the corporate interest of Mona Lisa in concluding the \"collaboration contract\" with Magnar would be hardly found unless this is seen as part and parcel of a wider scheme put in place by Hassan Awdi.\n\nThe various steps are described in Respondent\u2019s Answers to the Tribunal Post-hearing Questions dated 17 January 2014 (\"Resp. Answers\"), \u00b6\u00b6 105-110.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted the controversies surrounding the term \"investment\" as used in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Absent a definition in Article 25, the Tribunal considers that the principal legal framework to determine the existence of an \"investment\" must lie in the will of the Parties as set forth in the definition of an \"investment\" under the BIT as long as such will is compatible with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The *Salini* criteria may be useful to describe typical characteristics of an investment, but they cannot, as a rule, override the will of the parties, given the undefined and somewhat flexible term used by the drafters of the ICSID Convention.\n\n198.\n\nRecent arbitral jurisprudence has, in particular pointed to the normative and conceptual difficulties surrounding the *Salini* criterion being the requirement of a contribution to the development of the host State. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that such a criterion cannot be read into the term \"investment\" in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. First and foremost, the text of Article 25 contains no reference to such a requirement and arbitral tribunals cannot add their own subtext to the ICSID Convention. This is also true, in general, when it comes to interpreting the term \"investment\" as defined by the parties to a BIT. Such a definition cannot be redefined by a tribunal, but must be accepted on the terms provided in the text of the parties.\n\n199.\n\nThus, the definition of \"investment\" in a treaty will determine its content in an exclusive way, with no room for additions or subtractions. Only when the definition of \"investment\" chosen by the parties to the treaty refers to the notion of investment (as is sometimes the case) may the specific components of the definition be supplemented by additional elements deduced from the term \"investment\" as interpreted under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In the BIT applicable to the present dispute, no such \"double reference\" to investment is found.\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the term \"contribution,\" as used sometime by the Parties in the context of investment, concerns the requirement that the investor commits a certain amount of resources, economic or otherwise.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that Claimants Hassan Awdi and EBC have made indirectly investments covered by the BIT via notably share purchases and monetary injections in Rodipet through Magnar since 12 February 2004 and in Casa Bucur through Claimant Alfa El Corporation\u2019s control of Alfa El Romania since 23 December 2003 until 2 July 2007 and through Hassan Awdi\u2019s control of Mona Lisa since 2 July 2007 until 21 April 2008 and then from 21 April 2008.260 This economic link between Claimants and the investments is sufficient for purposes of jurisdiction, the \"investment\" requirement under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT being thus met. The amount and nature of Claimants\u2019 investments shall be described in Sections VI and VII.261\n\nAppendices A and J to Cl. Answers, respectively.\n\nSection VI as to Claimants\u2019 Investments Regarding Rodipet and Section VII as to Claimants\u2019 Investments Regarding Casa Bucur.\n\n202.\n\nThe matters in dispute are \"legal disputes\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) since they concern the violation of Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT, international law, and Romanian law.\n\n**1. Fork-in-the-Road**\n-----------------------\n\n203.\n\nRegarding Respondent\u2019s objection to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence with respect to the Casa Bucur claim by Alfa El Corporation as owner of 99.99% shares in Alfa El Romania (later renamed Alfa El Bucur262) by reason of the fork-in-the-road provision under Article Vl(2)(a) of the BIT,263 the following may be noted. The condition for the operation of the fork-in-the-road is that the investor has not \"submitted the dispute for resolution\" before the court of the State that is a party to the dispute. The provision is meant to avoid that by resorting initially to the State courts and then to arbitration under the BIT, the investor tries its case a second time should it be not satisfied with the outcome of the first attempt before the local courts.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 524.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 176, referring to the claim brought by Alfa El Romania against Respondent before the Bucharest Tribunal in December 2006 (C-355) and in May 2007 (C-356).\n\n204.\n\nThis is not what occurred in the present instance considering that following the filing of the claim before the Bucharest Tribunal by Alfa El Bucur the case did not proceed from that very point in time. In fact, as mentioned by Claimants, the Romanian courts \"annulled Alfa El Bucur\u2019s claims\" due to its failure to pay the court fees and judicial stamps applicable to pecuniary relief.264 The Tribunal considers that in view of the circumstance that Alfa El Bucur\u2019s claims never proceeded and the cases were never heard before the Romanian courts there is no room for application of the fork-in-the-road provision of the BIT, the purpose of this provision being, as mentioned by Respondent, \"to preclude parallel litigation.\"265 This conclusion dispenses the Tribunal from examining the applicability of the triple identity test, as contended by Claimants to exclude the operation of the fork-in-the-road provision, or of the \"normative source\" test, as contended by Respondent to assert the operation of this provision.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 761(b), referring to the Bucharest District Court\u2019s Decisions of 30 January 2007 (C-357) and 26 September 2007 (C-358), respectively.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 375.\n\n205.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal holds that ICSID has jurisdiction and it has competence regarding all claims raised by Claimants in these proceedings.\n\n**2. Admissibility**\n--------------------\n\n206.\n\nRespondent\u2019s objection to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims concerning Rodipet has regard to the manner by which Rodipet\u2019s business had been run, the Awdi Group companies instituting \"a dizzying carousel of transactions - loans, leases, sub-leases, sales, mortgages, service agreements, etc. - the underlying aim of which was to strip Rodipet of its business and assets.\"266 Respondent adds that Magnar did not fulfil its obligations towards Rodipet\u2019s employees,267 and Claimants did not fulfil their investment obligations. Respondent admits that there is \"nothing wrong with the vision of creating something like the \"Rodipet Group\" whereby the different aspects of a business are divested to separate companies, each focusing on one specific aspect,\"268 provided all companies were owned by Rodipet, with each of them aiming to maximize its own business.269\n\nResp. C. Mem., \u00b6 148.\n\nResp. C-Mem.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 157.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 157.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that what matters in these proceedings is whether Claimants made investments pursuant to the Privatization Contract in order to be entitled to assert a claim in that regard under the BIT, a subject that shall be examined below. The manner by which Claimants conducted Rodipet\u2019s business would have been more for AVAS to control in the light of Magnar\u2019s undertaking under the Privatization Contract, for a period of five years from the acquisition of shares in Rodipet: (i) \"not to propose, support or decide... the minimisation or modification of the main activity, as stated in the Company\u2019s Certification of Incorporation\" (Article 10.5); (ii) \"to maintain... the number of employees of the Company that are employed with a labour contract of indefinite duration at the time of transfer of ownership of shares\" (Article 10.9), assuming all existing rights and obligations regarding employees listed in Article 10.8.\n\n208.\n\nFailure to respect the social obligations would have entailed the termination of the Privatization Contract with immediate effect (Article 10.10). Termination was notified by AVAS for breach by Magnar of its social obligations on 13 July 2OO9270 soon after the enforcement of the Pledge. The effect of such termination on Claimants\u2019 claims regarding Rodipet shall be examined below, in Section VI.271\n\nNotification from AVAS to Magnar dated 13 July 2009 (R- 244).\n\n*Infra,* \u00b6 333.\n\n209.\n\nRegarding Magnar\u2019s undertaking to maintain Rodipet\u2019s main activity and not to minimise or modify the same, AVAS should have been alerted by Magnar\u2019s repeated requests for approval of planned transfers of part of Rodipet\u2019s business and assets that fulfilment of that undertaking was at stake. A list of activities that had been outsourced by Rodipet to other companies of the Awdi Group, leading to its insolvency, was reported to the insolvency court by Cornel Florea, the judicial administrator of Rodipet in insolvency.272\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 159, referring to the First Witness Statement of Cornel Florea.\n\n210.\n\nRegarding some of the activities that were outsourced, Magnar had requested AVAS\u2019 approval and had then implemented the same in the absence of a reply by AVAS. The increase of the kiosk network proposed by Hassan Awdi on behalf of Magnar in a letter to AVAS on 14 December 2004273 is a relevant example. These new kiosks were not to be owned by Rodipet but by Supremo, the latter leasing the kiosks to Rodipet. Later, in September 2008, Supremo purchased the entire network of 1,365 old kiosks. Both transactions were in breach of the Privatization Contract (Article 11.1),274 entailing penalties owed to AVAS (Article 11.2).\n\nLetter dated 14 December 2004 from Magnar to AVAS (C-83).\n\nAs mentioned by Respondent: Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 177-179; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 187-192.\n\n211.\n\nIt is Claimants\u2019 position that in order to increase efficiency of operations, reduce costs and improve profitability Rodipet\u2019s business had to be transformed into companies specializing in the various activities (courier, contracting and distribution of subscriptions, integrated computing and data services), the whole under the umbrella of the so-called Rodipet Group.275 Claimants add that this restructuring and the ensuing transfer of employees were expressly accepted by both parties at the time of entering into the Privatization Contract,276which is denied by Respondent.277\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 96. \u2019\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 96.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 168-169.\n\n212.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, in fact, there is no convincing evidence of what Respondent defines as a systematic looting of Rodipet\u2019s business and assets and non-compliance by Claimants in relation to the rights of Rodipet\u2019s employees, let alone evidence at a level required to meet the threshold of inadmissibility, be it on the ground of misrepresentation and/or the principle of good faith in an investment arbitration. The diverging outcome of criminal investigations and proceedings brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention278 does not permit to draw any final conclusions in that regard. The absence of convincing evidence leads accordingly the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent\u2019s inadmissibility objection.\n\nSuch as, on the one side, the acquitting by the Bucharest Tribunal of Hassan Awdi and Alex Sweiss of all charges of human trafficking for labour exploitation (Cl. Rep., \u00b6 97), and. on the other side. Respondent\u2019s notice of 1 December 2014 regarding the Bucharest Court of Appeal\u2019s \"final\" decision of 27 November 2014 reclassifying the criminal acts perpetrated by Hassan Awdi and Mehdi Awdi in the \"CFR-Mesagerie\" case, reducing the sentence for each of them from 10 to 8 years and, respectively, 6 years and fom months imprisonment.\n\n213.\n\nUnder the Privatization Contract, Claimants accepted specific undertakings, such as those regarding the Protocol with the trade unions or the restructuring plan with the Competition Council. To the extent Claimants\u2019 conduct remains confined within the ambit of these contractual undertakings, it will be for the sanctions under the applicable contract to provide a remedy. Enforcement of the Pledge, imposition of penalties and termination of the Privatization Contract were the contractual remedies implemented by AVAS. It will be up to the Tribunal to determine whether AVAS\u2019 enforcement of any such remedy was in breach of the BIT or other rules of international law, as claimed by Claimants and denied by Respondent.\n\n**VI. CLAIMANTS\u2019 INVESTMENTS REGARDING RODIPET**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Investments in Rodipet**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n214.\n\nFollowing a privatization process, on 23 December 2003, AVAS and Magnar entered into the **Privatization Contract** for the sale to Magnar of 100% of the share capital of Rodipet. The new owner and the new board members were registered with the Chamber of Trade on 10 May 2004.\n\n215.\n\nUnder Article 2(a) of the Privatization Contract, the Purchase Price for Rodipet\u2019s shares, representing 100% of the registered capital on the date of signature, was ROL 2,266,614,350 (approximately EUR 54,600) taking into account the heavy debt that Rodipet owed to the Awdi Group.279 As recorded by Addendum No. 3 to the Privatization Contract, on 23 March 2007, Magnar bought additional shares that had been created by the cancellation of Rodipet\u2019s debts to State institutions worth RON 170,317,63 (approximately EUR 50,440), representing over 47% of the increased share capital.280\n\nCl.

Thus, Claimants requested an amendment of the ordinance to reflect the agreement between AVAS and Magnar under Article 3.1 of the Privatization Contract. On 28 October 2004, the Romanian Parliament enacted Law 442. For Claimants, Law 442, *inter alia,* \"grant[ed] a 49-year concession (plus an additional period of 24 years and 6 months) to Rodipet to use for free the lands owned by the State and the territorial administrative units of the existing and future kiosks.\"285\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6 52.\n\n220.\n\nAdditionally, in order to ensure the proper performance of Magnar\u2019s financial obligations, the Privatization Contract provided for various guarantees in the form of bank guarantees and Pledges, specifically a bank guarantee to AVAS for the infusion of USD 1,000,000 (Article 13.1(a)) and Pledges over all Rodipet\u2019s shares dated the same date of the Privatization Contract to secure the performance by Magnar of the development investment (the **\"First Share Pledge Agreement\")** and a Pledge over Rodipet\u2019s Additional Shares subsequently transferred to Magnar in order to guarantee the performance of the second phase of the investment under a Pledge Agreement dated 24 June 2004 (the **\"Second Share Pledge Agreement\").**\n\n221.\n\nUnder Article 15.4 of the Privatization Contract, AVAS was entitled to enforce the Pledge on shares and the bank guarantee should Magnar fail to observe its obligations regarding the 5-year investment program.\n\n222.\n\nUnder Articles 3 of the Privatization Contract the transfer of the ownership of shares was subject to a condition precedent to be fulfilled not later than 31 March 2004 consisting of the conversion of shares of the debts owed by Rodipet to the Romanian State and the grant of a 49-year concession (with possible 24.5-year extension) of the lands on which the points of sale stood. Addendum No. 1 of 30 April 2004 extended by two months said deadline. Under Addendum No. 2 of 30 April 2004, the Parties agreed to add a \"Best Efforts Clause\" regarding the issuance of a normative act for the granting to Rodipet of a 49-year concession for the points of sale on the Romanian territory, except for those in Bucharest.\n\n223.\n\nAccording to Claimants, since investing in Rodipet in 2005, they had not only fulfilled but exceeded all of their financial obligations pursuant to the Privatization Contract. The obligations included (i) Claimants\u2019 initial payment of ROL 2,264,350,000 (approx. EUR 54,545) for all 90,574 shares of Rodipet and ROL 170,317,63 (approx.

Pursuant to Article 13.2 of the Privatization Contract, Magnar also provided a Certificate issued on 31 May 2004 by an internal auditor and an external auditor. On 25 June 2004, AVAS acknowledged the payment and Certificate and released the Bank Guarantee Letter for the value of USD 1,000,000.287 On 10 May 2005, Magnar notified AVAS of the payment of USD 950,000 under Article 13.1(b) of the Privatization Contract and provided a Certificate issued on 28 December 2005 by an internal auditor and an external auditor.

The loan agreements were as follows:309\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Bank** | **Borrower** | **Contract Number** | **Facility Type** | **Loan** **Amount** | **Term** |\n| Bancpost | Rodipet SA | 13/19.12.2004 | Working capital | 4,900,000 | Dec-08 |\n| Egnatia Bank | Supremo Media | FA2788/29.03.2007 | Working capital | 2,800,000 | Jun-09 |\n| Egnatia Bank | Your Hotels | FA3021/10.05.2007 | Investment Credit | 350,000 | May-17 |\n| Egnatia Bank | Mona Lisa BP | FA2292/05.12.2006 | Investment Credit | 1,540,000 | Dec-08 |\n\nThe Table is in Cl.

The difference is even larger if one considers the shorter time period to which the higher amount refers.\n\n236.\n\nIn reply to Respondent\u2019s comments of 13 June 2014 on said letter, Claimants contend that the purpose of their submission of 26 May 2014 was not to provide evidence of investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT but only to give direct evidence of concrete payments. They add that the main purpose of Respondent\u2019s comments is to allege again a money carousel between companies of the Rodipet Group.312\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of 30 June 2014, p. 7.\n\n237.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s critical remarks, payments for the cars were made based on leasing contracts the purpose of which was to purchase cars for the Rodipet Group. Most of the leasing contracts over the fleet of vehicles were paid up by 2009, therefore the vehicles that were object of these contracts were assets of the Rodipet Group.313 Similarly, regarding the investment made in IT, the purpose of the Charisma software was to organize the accounting of the kiosk network due to their location throughout Romania and only payments qualifying as investments in IT were included.314 The bank statements were not submitted to AVAS since \"underlying documents\" were requested by AVAS only in June 2009, well after the calling of the Pledge and requests to be registered on the Share Registry.315\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of 30 June 2014, p. 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of 30 June 2014, pp. 8-9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of 30 June 2014, p. 9, referring to C-220 and C-23l. As a matter of fact, these two Exhibits refer to requests made by AVAS to Rodipet earlier than June 2009, in April and May 2009.\n\n238.\n\nAccording to Claimants, irrefutable proof that they invested in kiosks, IT, and vehicles can be found on the ground, Rodipet having, when bankruptcy proceedings were opened, a network of 1,764 kiosks, a fleet of 230 vehicles, and a business organized by a software program ensuring the most efficient distribution.316\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of 30 June 2014, pp. 10-11, referring to the McGregor report of 14 June 2013 (\u00b6\u00b6 6.10-6.13) and the Uifelean report (R-134, p. 5) for the kiosks and to the Grantham report of 15 March 2013 (\u00b6 8.2.2) and the Uifelean report (R-134, p. 4) for the car fleet.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n239.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Romanian economy was faced with the main challenge of implementing an extensive privatization program involving over 10,000 companies. This transition was on the whole very successful through the active involvement of AVAS and the adoption of legislation, such as the Privatization Law of 1991. Romania\u2019s accession to the European Union in 2007 was the result of the efforts to provide a functioning market economy capable of competing in the European market. In parallel, a fundamental reform was undertaken to establish an independent and effective justice system.\n\n240.\n\nSince his arrival in Romania in the 1990s, Hassan Awdi organized a business model based on the establishment and management of various loosely defined \"group of companies,\" controlled not by the same holding and not all of them owned by Hassan Awdi, lack of transparency of the system being no doubt intentional.\n\n241.\n\nThe Awdi business model consisted of members of the family acquiring a company following its privatization and quickly stripping it of its assets. This is illustrated by the \"CFR-Mesagerie\" case where, upon its acquisition in 2004, close associates of Hassan Awdi were appointed to all key positions, including his brother Mehdi Awdi. Not even two years had passed since the privatization when insolvency proceedings were opened against CFR-Mesagerie. During the proceedings, a number of suspicious transaction with Awdi Group companies appeared, which were terminated by the Syndic Judge with respective amounts being in part recovered.\n\n242.\n\nThe history of Rodipet from privatization to insolvency is similar, Rodipet\u2019s assets and most desirable aspects of the business having been misappropriated, social obligations to employees being neglected. At the time of privatization, Rodipet was carrying out an important public service, having monopoly over press distribution in Romania. The State was willing to privatize it, forgiving debts and granting other forms of State aid to this end but not that its assets and business could be used for something completely different.\n\n243.\n\nThere is no disagreement with Claimants regarding the negotiations between AVAS and Magnar and the contractual obligations which were fundamental to AVAS to agree to the privatization. However, contrary to what is argued by Claimants,317 the obligation relating to Rodipet employees under Article 10.9 of the Privatization Contract was to maintain the number of employees, not of \"jobs,\" AVAS\u2019 concern being dismissal, unemployment, and possible social unrest.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 101.\n\n244.\n\nAfter the privatization was completed, matters proceeded initially as envisaged. The Competition Council authorized State aid to Rodipet in May 2006 with conditions mostly relating to a restructuring plan that Rodipet undertook to implement and that was approved, noting that about 60% of the total costs of the restructuring were covered by Magnar and Rodipet.318 Compensatory measures to prevent excessive distortion of competition were set out, mostly relating to selling capacities.319\n\nDecision of the Competition Council (C-50, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28 and 30).\n\nDecision of the Competition Council (C-50, \u00b6\u00b6 63 and 65).\n\n245.\n\nAs far as Magnar\u2019s investment obligations are concerned, AVAS confirmed on 25 June 2009 the second of the two capital injections of USD 1 million each under Article 13.1 of the Privatization Contract.320 The first capital injection and the fulfilment of the first three technical investment obligations under Article 14.1 of the Privatization Contract were confirmed by AVAS only on 3 June 2008 due to the pendency of the dispute which arose in August 2006 between AVAS and Magnar relating to Magnar\u2019s performance of its business obligation under Article 10.12 of the Privatization Contract.321\n\nLetter from AVAS to Magnar dated 25 June 2004 (C-59).\n\nLetter from AVAS to Magnar dated 3 June 2008 (C-62); Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 95.\n\n246.\n\nIn reality, Magnar did not make the necessary investments but instead the Awdi Group instituted a carousel of transactions - loans, leases, subleases, sales, mortgages, service agreements, etc - the aim of which was to strip Rodipet of its business and assets.322 Contrary to Claimants\u2019 insistence that *\"Magnar fulfilled all of its financial obligations under the Privatization Contract,\"323* Magnar did not invest the amounts due for the Fourth and Fifth Years and in any case made no money available to Rodipet to make the technical investments it desperately needed, the new assets (IT system, kiosks and car fleet) becoming the property of companies other than Rodipet.324\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 148-212.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b673.\n\nResp. Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 34-39.\n\n247.\n\nMagnar made several payments to that effect but the bank statements show that the same day they were transferred as \"undue amount\" to Mona Lisa bank account under a cooperation agreement signed on 15 November 2006, as shown by Rodipet\u2019s special administrator\u2019s report from January 2011 analysing the account\u2019s entries. Rodipet\u2019s assets were not renewed and upgraded as they should have been under the Privatization Contract.\n\n248.\n\nDifferent aspects of Rodipet\u2019s business were divested to separate companies of the so-called Rodipet Group, each focusing on a particular aspect. However, these companies were not owned by Rodipet but by different companies and individuals of the Awdi Group. Rodipet Courier, Supremo, and Balbec Retail were party to transactions through which kiosks, a car fleet and other real estate assets were dissipated, as explained by Cornel Florea, Rodipet\u2019s judicial administrator.\n\n249.\n\nThe plan of the Awdi Group was to entirely remove from Rodipet\u2019s assets the valuable kiosk network.\n\n250.\n\nUnder a franchising contract, Westland and Supremo could run the trade in newspapers under the Rodipet trademark at commercially outrageous conditions. Under another contract, Supremo could use Rodipet\u2019s advertising space in the latter\u2019s kiosks. Further, under an agreement with Supremo, Rodipet agreed to lend the latter approximately EUR 4.5 million and USD 6 million, later increased to EUR 7 million and USD 9.4 million, under a 10-year credit facility, no security for the loan being provided by Supremo.\n\n251.\n\nThe third company of the Awdi Group, Balbec, obtained properties from Rodipet with EUR 1.4 million in repayment of a loan of EUR 536,538 a mere month after the loan was granted, no permission being obtained from AVAS for these agreements, putting Magnar in breach of Article 11.1 of the Privatization Contract.\n\n252.\n\nSpecifically, Rodipet Courier was set up to appropriate Rodipet\u2019s logistical work of distributing the press around the country. It appropriated a key part of Rodipet\u2019s core business, the distribution and trade of Romania and foreign press, under a contract leaving the risk of any unpredictable events with Rodipet, Rodipet Courier being entitled to terminate the contract by one day advance notice with no similar right for Rodipet.\n\n253.\n\nThe main culprit for emptying Rodipet with some role in almost every transaction was Supremo, the company described by DIICOT as the one by which the money movements in and out the various entities were coordinated. The first area of intervention by Supremo was the sale of its fleet of vans to Rodipet under a number of sale contracts, each time for the purchase price originally paid by Supremo with no adjustments for depreciation. Another area was the ownership and use of Rodipet\u2019s kiosks sold by Rodipet to Supremo while the right to use the land on which kiosks are placed was subleased to Rodikiosk even if this was prohibited by the 1998 General Law on Concessions.\n\n254.\n\nRomanian authorities became aware of the Awdi Group\u2019s actions as a result of tax cross-control carried out in April and May 2009 and a full tax audit of Rodipet, completed in October - November 2009, during which numerous failures to report and pay applicable taxes were discovered. ANAF, the tax authority, calculated the total tax liability for unpaid tax and penalties at approximately EUR 52.3 million and filed criminal complaints with DIICOT.\n\n255.\n\nThree DIICOT investigations were opened. One (38/D/P/2011) concerned CFR-Messagerie, with Hassan Awdi and others indicted for embezzlement, money laundering, and other crimes. The second one (390/D/P/2006) was to establish whether acts committed in the running of the Awdi Group of companies fulfilled the criteria for the crimes of running a criminal organization, embezzlement, tax evasion and money laundering, focusing on suspicious money transactions by which funds and assets were siphoned from Rodipet. The third one (304/D/P/2008) concerned the human trafficking for forced labor.325\n\nSee reference to the outcome of DIICOT first and third investigations, *supra, n.277.*\n\n256.\n\nIt is in the context of the investigation regarding Rodipet that on 22 June 2010, based on search warrants by the Criminal Chamber of the Bucharest Tribunal, searches were conducted and documents seized. Inventories were made of the materials seized which were completed in February 2011 so that most of the documents (over 90%) could be returned to their owners. Subsequently, DIICOT also searched the electronic devices seized with the help of an expert.\n\n257.\n\nOnce Rodipet\u2019s financial situation was clarified and the \"outsourcing policy\" of the Awdi Group was discovered leading to the company\u2019s demise, Rodipet\u2019s administrators sought to cancel a number of agreements transferring assets to other companies in the Awdi Group and to have debts to Supremo, Balbec, Rodipet Courier and others struck off the list of creditors. Rodipet was left as a bare shell, AVAS being unable to recover the contractual penalties due under the Privatization Contract since Magnar was placed in insolvency on February 2011.\n\n258.\n\nAccording to Respondent\u2019s submission of 13 June 2014, Claimants\u2019 new evidence provided by their letter of 26 May 2014 fails to show that any of the relevant amounts is an investment under the ICSID Convention and Article 1 of the BIT. There is in fact no evidence of the purpose for which the payment was made, payments made by one company to another company in the ordinary course of business not representing \"investments.\"326\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, end of p. 2.\n\n259.\n\nRegarding Investment Years 4 and 5, according to Respondent the new documents contradict the investment certificates for the same years provided to Magnar at the time and filed in this arbitration, no correlation apparently existing between the new documents and the previous investment certificates, as shown by a table provided by Responded.327 Specifically, as shown by said table, Rodipet was not the beneficiary of any of these payments which were all made to various other companies unrelated to the so-called Rodipet Group.\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, pp. 3-4; the table is onp. 4.\n\n260.\n\nFurther, the bank statements that are provided as evidence do not give any details regarding the purpose of the transfer, specifically in Rodipet\u2019s vehicle fleet, IT or kiosk network. They contradict Claimants\u2019 prior argument that investments for Years 4 and 5 had already been made in 2006 while according to the new evidence, investments were made from 2007 to 2OO8.328 No explanation is given, according to Respondent, why such evidence was provided so late despite AVAS\u2019 several requests for underlying financial and accounting documents attesting the reality of such investments. The new evidence suggests rather the existence of additional money carousels.329\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, pp. 5-8.\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, pp. 10-11, referring in particular to AVAS\u2019 request to Magnar by letter dated 1 June 2009 (C-235).\n\n261.\n\nRegarding Claimants\u2019 evidence of excess investments in Rodipet in Years 1-3, as specifically requested by the Tribunal\u2019s letter to the Parties dated 12 May 2014, the only exhibit that shows payments made to Rodipet is *C-697bis* for the amount of EUR 2,902,940,00, \"used as working capital by Rodipet.\"330 However, in Respondent\u2019s view this evidence raises problems of form and substance since the relevant bank statements show that the alleged investments made by Magnar to Rodipet for Years 1 and 2 are part of a money carousel from Supremo to Magnar to Rodipet and eventually back to Magnar.331 Further, the new documents contradict the information provided by the certificates delivered to AVAS for Years 1-3, since the funds were used for purposes other than those certified by the auditors, showing in addition several suspicious transfers having taken place on the same day and for similar amounts.332\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, p. 13.\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, pp. 14-17.\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, pp. 17-22.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to the previous analysis of the Parties\u2019 debate whether contributions stand for investments.333 It has taken note of AVAS\u2019 confirmation of investments made by Magnar regarding payment of the price for the initial shares of Rodipet,334 for the Additional Shares335 and for the first and second capital injections of USD one million each under Article 13.1 of the Privatization Contract336 as well as the fulfilment of the investment for growth obligations for the first three Years under Article 14.1 of the same Contract.337\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 195-199.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 196-200.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 62, mentioning payment in two instalments, as acknowledged by AVAS (Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 87).\n\nCl.Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88,91.\n\n263.\n\nIt cannot be disputed that Claimants have made investments in Rodipet under the Privatization Contract to the extent of amounts confirmed by AVAS. AVAS had all the time and power to inquire about the effectiveness of investments made indirectly by Claimants through Magnar or other companies controlled by Hassan Awdi before confirming them, or even thereafter, should it have doubts in that regard. Such investments qualify for purposes of the BIT as falling within the definition of \"investment\" under its Article 1.1(a) thereof.\n\n264.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position in the last phase of this arbitration contending that Claimants have failed to provide any evidence of having made a \"contribution\" in Magnar or Rodipet338 must be rejected as belated and in any case contradicted by AVAS\u2019 prior confirmation that investments had been made in accordance with the Privatization Contract.339 Respondent\u2019s reliance on Mehdi Awdi\u2019s testimony at the hearing to deny Claimants\u2019 investments is misplaced, the part of the transcript referred to by Respondent showing that no specific time period had been indicated to the witness during his examination (when Supremo bought kiosks in lieu of Rodipet), Respondent itself admitting being surprised by \"the limited state of his *[i.e.* Mehdi Awdi\u2019s] knowledge.\"340\n\nResp. Answers, \u00b6 17; RPHB., \u00b6 14.\n\nAmong Claimants\u2019 \"contributions\" to Rodipet is the conversion to shares in Rodipet on 28 December 2004 of the debt owed by the latter to Supremo (Cl. Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38), a company then owned by Claimant Alfa El Corporation (Cl. Answers, Appendix C). Respondent\u2019s denies that this debt conversion is a \"contribution\" and that it is proven (Resp. Answers, \u00b6 17(e); RPHB, \u00b6I4). On the subject see *infra,* \u00b6 265.\n\nResp. Answers, \u00b6 36.\n\n265.\n\nHaving thus considered that investments had been made by Magnar or other company controlled by Hassan Awdi regarding Rodipet up to and including amounts corresponding to the fulfilment of the first three Years of investment obligations, it remains to be determined whether: (i) Claimants have complied with the investment obligations for the Fourth and Fifth Year in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Privatization Contract; and (ii) additional investments have been made regarding Rodipet which may be accepted as being proven. This shall be examined below and in the context of Claimants\u2019 claim of illegal enforcement of the Pledge by AVAS.341\n\n*Infra,* \u00b6\u00b6 368-383.\n\n266.\n\nRespondent\u2019s contention that the new assets (IT system, kiosks and car fleet) became the property of companies of the Awdi Group other than Rodipet, such as Rodipet Courier, Supremo and Intelbiz,342 pertains to the ultimate destination of these assets, specifically whether the sale or leasing of any of them by Rodipet had received AVAS\u2019 required approval under the Privatization Contract. This matter has in fact regard to the implementation of the Privatization Contract and AVAS\u2019 power of control over Magnar\u2019s fulfilment of its obligations thereunder. To the extent any such investment had been made by companies directly or indirectly controlled by Claimants, the so-called Rodipet Group, they may qualify as investments under the BIT, provided evidence is given by Claimants that such investments were actually made for the benefit of Rodipet.343\n\nResp. Answers, \u00b6 24.\n\nAs already mentioned, no convincing evidence lias been adduced by Respondent regarding Claimants\u2019 plan of divestiture of Rodipet\u2019s business and assets so that the relevant investments could not form the basis of Claimants\u2019 claim: *supra,* \u00b6 212.\n\n267.\n\nClaimants assert that Supremo, a company controlled by Hassan Awdi, was owed a huge amount of debt by Rodipet, equal to EUR 1,518,987,81, the majority of which had been agreed should be converted into shares of Rodipet by forgiving the debt.344 Respondent has contended that there is no evidence of this being the case.345 The Tribunal agrees that there is no satisfactory evidence regarding this debt conversion into Rodipet\u2019s shares and the relevant amount, let alone that the debt in question was a legitimate and valid one. Accordingly, it shall not consider it when determining the amount of Claimants\u2019 investments regarding Rodipet.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 38; Cl. Rep., \u00b6 582; Cl. Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 36, 38.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 46; *see also* RPHB, \u00b6 16(a).\n\n268.\n\nIn their submission of 26 May 2014, Claimants claim to have invested EUR 5,303,464 in excess of their investment obligations. The evidence in that regard is unconvincing,346 the reason being the lack of showing that these \"investments\" were made for Rodipet and non-duplicative of investments for which investment certificates were granted for Years 1 to 3, as acknowledged by the Tribunal.\n\nExhibits C-677 to C-697.\n\n269.\n\nFor Years 4 and 5, there is similarly a lack of evidence that the investments claimed by Claimants for kiosks and fleets were incurred for Rodipet\u2019s benefit. Mere pictures of kiosks are offered as evidence347 rather than purchase contracts accompanied by proof of payment and causation with Rodipet. As regards alleged investments in fleets, whereas fiscal invoices identifying Rodipet as buyer have been provided,348 the evidence on record shows that alleged payments were made by Supremo as opposed to Rodipet pursuant to a sub-lease agreement between Rodipet and Supremo where Rodipet is the mere sublessee.349\n\nExhibits C-453, C-455, and C-458.\n\nAttachment to R-137.\n\nC-68l and C-682.\n\n270.\n\nThings are somewhat different regarding IT investment for Years 4 and 5, allegedly for EUR 2,061,595 and 2,635,996, respectively relying on bank statements.350 Respondent has objected to this claim contending that these amounts were paid to third parties without showing any benefit for Rodipet, and argued that none of the payments shown by bank statements may thus be considered as evidence of any investments.351\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission dated 26 May 2014, table on p. 2, with reference to C-687, C-688 (for Year 4), C-689 and C-690 (for Year 5).\n\nResp. Submission dated 13 June 2014, p. 7.\n\n271.\n\nBank statements of Intelbiz show payments to Totalsoft for EUR 487,198,67 for Year 4 and for EUR 485,234,91 for Year 5,352 while other documents filed by Claimants show Rodipet\u2019s connection with Intelbiz-Totalsoft relations.353 The total amount of such payments is equal to EUR 972,433,58. Due to uncertainty regarding the final beneficiary of the total amount, whether Rodipet or in part third parties, the Tribunal decides that 50% of such amount, equal to EUR 486,216,79, may be considered as Claimants\u2019 investment to Rodipet\u2019s benefit.\n\nC- 688, pp. 35 and following and from pp. 22 and following of C-690, respectively.\n\nSchedule of Deliverables - Totalsoft dated 4 September 2008 (C-607); Internal Email from HR Manager Rodipet Business Solutions to HR Manager Rodipet dated 29 October 2007 3.03PM - Rodipet S.A. Organigrama (C-608); Internal Email from HR Manager Rodipet Business Solutions to HR Manager Rodipet dated 29 October 2007 5.53PM - Request for Total Soft (C-609); Email from Cotmnercial Deputy Intelbiz to Total Soft, Intelbiz and Rodipet Managers dated 28 August 2008 - Total Soft Situation up to date (C- 610).\n\n272.\n\nIn the light also of the foregoing, the following \"investments\" are accepted by the Tribunal as having been made by Claimants, directly or through other companies controlled by Hassan Awdi, regarding Rodipet:\n\n(ii) EUR 55,733,80, equivalent to the amount of ROL 2,266,614,350 paid by Magnar on 10 May 2004 as price for the purchase of Rodipet\u2019s shares under Art. 5.1. of the Privatization Contract, converted in EUR on that date;354\n\n(iii) EUR 4,913,226, being the aggregate amount of Rodipet\u2019s share capital increases paid by Magnar or by companies controlled by Claimant Hassan Awdi;355\n\n(iv) EUR 2,088,000, corresponding to investments for years 1 to 3 under Appendix No. 6 to the Privatization Contract;356\n\n(v) EUR 486,216,79, being 50% of the aggregate amount of IT investments for the Years 4 (EUR 487,198,67) and 5 (EUR 485,234,91).357\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 45. This payment is confirmed by Respondent (Resp. Answers, \u00b6 17(b)). On 10 May 2004 Claimants owned 97% of Magnar (Cl. Answers, Appendix B). Conversion is made based on the web site oanda.com\n\nThe Trade Register document of the Ministry of Justice (R-101) records the share capital increases regarding Rodipet for the period until December 2008, as shown by Cl. Answers (\u00b6 5 and table at \u00b6 6) for a total amount indicated as being equal to RON 22,449,285, corresponding to EUR 5,844,200 (conversion in Euro being made at the rate prevailing on 10 July 2008, the date of repeal of Law 442, according to Oanda.com. The amount of EUR 5,864,220 was subsequently reduced to EUR 4,913,226 by Claimants\u2019 letter of 26 May 2014 (pp. 2-3).\n\nAs per the following breakdown:  \n \u2022 EUR 840,000 (Investment Certificate for Year 1, C-64)  \n \u2022 EUR 416,000 (Investment Certificate for Year 2, C-240)  \n \u2022 EUR 832,000 (investment Certificate for Year 3, C-66).  \n These investments were confirmed by AVAS\u2019 Letter to Magnar dated 3 June 2008 (C-62). Respondent\u2019s more recent statement that it \"does not accept that such investments [ i.e., the first three year investments] were ever made\" cannot be accepted as belated and based only on \"certificates [that] begin to look equally suspicious\" (RPHB, \u00b6 17).\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 269.\n\n273.\n\nA total of EUR 7,543,176,59 is therefore accepted as Claimants\u2019 investments under the BIT relating to Rodipet.\n\n274.\n\nThe currency in which investments were made, if other than in Euros, are converted in Euros. The Tribunal notes that under Article 13.1 of the Privatisation Contract, the initial share capital increases are expressed in USD while Appendix No. 6 indicates in EUR the five Year investment obligations. This shows that the Parties did not attach a particular significance to the Romanian currency. Further, when dealing with the amount of compensation due in case of expropriation Article III(l) of the BIT provides for its calculation \"in any freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange at the time\" a provision which may well apply to calculate compensation due also for other breaches of the BIT.358\n\nRespondent criticizes the use of Euro as inflating the value of any loss: Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 640; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 612. The Tribunal shares the view expressed by the MacGregor\u2019s report according to which \"It is not necessarily the case that a claim in Euros will result in a higher claim, although of course with hindsight one can work out which currency ultimately gives the higher loss and which the lower\" (\u00b6\u00b6 4.22, 4.23).\n\n**B. Law 442**\n--------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n275.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the concession granted to Rodipet by Law 442 is an investment under Article I (l)(a)(v) of the US-Romania BIT, which defines \"investment\" as including *\"(v) any right conferred by law or contract....\"*\n\n276.\n\nNo constitutionality concerns had been expressed by any of Romania\u2019s organs during the parliamentary process leading to the approval of Law 442 nor was a similar concern raised by AVAS during the negotiations or in the 2007 arbitration with Magnar before the Romanian Court of International Commercial Arbitration although at the time the constitutionality issue had already been raised by some municipalities.\n\n277.\n\nAccording to Claimants, unfair, arbitrary, and discriminatory treatment of investments is in breach of both Articles II (3)(a) and II (2)(b) of the BIT. There is no need that a measure be \"shocking,\" \"outrageous,\" \"egregious\" or in bad faith to come within the terms of these Articles. Further, under Article II(1), Romania is required to treat investments no less favorably than investments of its own nationals or of a third country\u2019s nationals.\n\n278.\n\nBy declaring the unconstitutionality of provisions granting land concessions to Claimants and not of the same or similar provisions granting land to other companies, Respondent has breached its obligation not to treat Claimant\u2019s investment less favorably or in a discriminatory manner.\n\n279.\n\nDecisions No. 823/2008 and 884/2008 of 7 and 10 July 2008 by the Constitutional Court holding the unconstitutionality of Articles 8(1) and 8(5) of Law 442 while holding that said Article 8 was constitutional on two previous occasions based on the same cause of action is a denial of justice. Rodipet relied on Decisions 434/2008 and 706/2008 that the constitutionality of Article 8(1) to 8(5) of Law 442 had been settled and that the Constitutional Court would have relied on such decisions to reject the remaining municipalities\u2019 claims. However, the Constitutional Court did exactly the opposite 20 days later in cases with the same cause of action and arguments. This is simply contrary and incompatible with the most basic principle of legal security, as held by ECHRS in two cases against Romania. It is also contrary to the *\"conscience juridique des peuples civilis\u00e9s\"* and constitutes *per se* a denial of justice.\n\n280.\n\nThe principle of legal certainty mandates to prevent a second review when the unconstitutionality pleas are based on similar grounds. In rejecting the unconstitutionality pleas on 20 December 2004359 and 7 May 2OO9,360 the Constitutional Court relied on its previous decisions regarding direct concessions granted by Article 32 of GEO No. 88/1997.\n\nRomanian Constitutional Court, Decision No. 566/2004 (CLA-37).\n\nRomanian Constitutional Court, Decision No. 720/2009 (CLA-117).\n\n281.\n\nRespondent breached Articles II(6) and II (2)(a) of the BIT by failing to take effective measures in order to remedy the constitutional defaults of Law 442, as requested by Rodipet and Magnar to the Romania Parliament and Government. Both of them refused to intervene arguing that they could not control court decisions. However, Claimants note that the legal effects of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision are suspended for 45 days under Article 147(1) of the Constitution and Article 31 of Law 47/1992 to permit the Parliament and the Government to correct constitutional defaults of the legal provisions reviewed by the Constitutional Court, this being a constitutional obligation as held by the same court. It would have been sufficient to the Parliament to enact an organic law granting 49-year land concessions.\n\n282.\n\nHowever, Law 442 was repealed by the Romanian Constitutional Court in July 2008, thus defeating a key condition to Claimants\u2019 investment in Rodipet. Under Law 442, Rodipet was granted a rent-free concession for 49 years, extendable for other 24.5 years, ensuring a uniform concession regime applicable nationwide.\n\n283.\n\nAccording to Claimants, absent that concession, the use of the land where the kiosks were located was granted by concession, rent or association/ cooperation agreements concluded with local authorities, state-owned companies or other public institutions, under agreements differing greatly concerning duration, price paid as a rent or legal basis. A uniform concession regime applicable nationwide was, according to Claimants, necessary to guarantee a stable and viable legal environment. Otherwise, Rodipet \"would have had to negotiate hundreds of contracts (one for each municipality) without the certainty of even being granted the use of the lands by the local mayors.\"361\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 113, footnote omitted.\n\n284.\n\nAVAS was notified about Rodipet\u2019s expectations and reliance on the concession for its success in the following terms: \"[t]o conclude, if AVAS and the ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT do not support Rodipet so that it can benefit from the provisions of Law no. 442/2004, the purchaser will be unable to maintain the number of employees (approx. 3300), as well as the other obligations undertaken through the privatization agreement or the ones undertaken towards the Romanian Press Club (Romanian press publishers, etc.).\"362 In order to accomplish the investments provided by the Privatization Contract, it was essential to make a viable company out of Rodipet so as to guarantee the employment of over 3000 workers and the legality and longevity of the occupation of the lands where the kiosks were (and the new would be) located. Such kiosks would have ensured a considerable competitive advantage over the new press distribution companies in Romania, as noted in the 2005 Rodipet Business Plan.\n\nLetter of Rodipet to AVAS dated 29 April 2005 (C-56, p. 5).\n\n285.\n\nIt is Claimants\u2019 position that Law 442 simply applied to Rodipet what was already provided in general terms under Romanian law by Article 32 of Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) No. 88/1997 and Ordinance No. 577/2002, which provide for the grant of 49-year concession contracts to privatized companies. Rodipet relied on the fact that Law 442 was an application of Ordinance No. 577/2002.\n\n286.\n\nFurther, according to Claimants, the 73.5-year rent free and nation-wide concession granted to Rodipet by Law 442 had to act as springboards to allow Claimants a development and growth of their portfolio by expanding their press distribution market from distribution itself to nation-wide delivery of all items beyond mere kiosks to include a convenience store model. The kiosk business was at the core of the Awdi Group of companies by providing the latter with an opportunity to thrive.\n\n287.\n\nThe perfect example of interdependence and reliance on a 49-year rent-free concession was Supremo Media, the advertising arm of Rodipet before the latter\u2019s privatization. Supremo would have had a competitive advantage from such concession, allowing it to prosper.\n\n288.\n\nRomania\u2019s breaches of the BIT led to the collapse of Rodipet and, as a result, to the progressive downfall of the companies that were dependent on Rodipet.\n\n289.\n\nRespondent\u2019s failure to enforce Law 442 and to correct its alleged constitutional irregularities breached the BIT obligation to grant a fair and equitable treatment. The municipalities and counties that were to implement Law 442 by granting a 49-year concession failed to do so in an utterly abusive and discriminatory manner, the central Government failing to provide effective means of enforcing Claimants\u2019 rights.\n\n290.\n\n25% of the existing kiosks were located on lands belonging to State-owned companies or public institutions. They had been enjoyed by Rodipet thanks to lease agreements. When conversion was requested under a 49-year concession pursuant to Law 442, 24 municipalities did grant the 49-year concession but demanded an annual fee (from EUR 2 to EUR 110 per m\u00b2, only one granted a 49-year rent-free contract.\n\n291.\n\nMost municipalities raised unsupported interpretations of Law 442 to refrain from granting any concession whatsoever. Some of them, like Brasov, Targoviste and Slatina, even decided that Rodipet\u2019s prior occupancy of public space was illegal ordering Rodipet to dismantle the kiosks. Some of these actions were discriminatory and politically motivated, 49-year concessions being granted to Romanian companies based on GEO No. 88 and Ordinance No. 577.\n\n292.\n\nFollowing the municipalities\u2019 opposition, Rodipet requested AVAS, the Government and the Parliament \"norms of application\" to prevent them from avoiding to apply Law 442. Romania failed to grant Claimants full protection and security under the BIT by failing to take the measures at its disposal to allow Claimants to fully enjoy the concession.\n\n293.\n\nArticle II(6) of the BIT, which provides that \"Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investment agreements and investment authorizations,\" comes into consideration in view of Rodipet\u2019s request for the enactment of provisions to implement Law 442. However, the organs of the Romanian State refused to intervene, AVAS limiting itself to answer that after the enactment of Law 442, it no longer had any contractual obligations. This shows that Romania gave merely lip-service when it enacted Law 442 but had no intention to protect Claimants\u2019 investment. Romania supported the unconstitutionality objection raised by the local authorities to avoid the implementation of Law 442, thus devaluing the foreign investor\u2019s investment.\n\n294.\n\nBetween January and August 2007, Rodipet filed no less than 25 lawsuits against municipalities and State-owned companies. A series of decisions were issued regarding the latter amounting to a denial of justice. The judgments delivered regarding 26 files were favorable as to 12 claims, dismissed regarding nine claims in view of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision that Article 8(l)-8(5) were unconstitutional and not finally settled as to the remaining claims. Some municipalities objecting to the constitutionality of Law 442 had granted 49-year concessions to privatized companies based on a provision of Ordinance No. 577 similar to the one of Law 442.\n\n295.\n\nThe Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment declaring Law 442 unconstitutional on July 2008363 followed a prior decision acknowledging the constitutionality of the same Law. The Court considered that the concession unduly restricted the possibility of the municipalities and the State to freely dispose of their property and that such restriction should have been imposed by an organic law, not an ordinary law as Law 442. The *erga omnes* and immediate effect of such decision caused the Romanian tribunals that had so far ordered the granting of a 49-year concession to reject Rodipet\u2019s claims that were then pending, the Court of Appeal to grant the appeals made by the municipalities, and the latter to deny Rodipet\u2019s pending requests or annual concessions already granted.\n\nDecision No. 823 of 7 July 2008 of the Constitutional Court of Romania (C-15).\n\n296.\n\nICSID tribunals have emphasized that there is an expropriation when a court judgment substantially deprives the investor of the ownership, control, or benefits arising from its investment. ICSID awards are referred to by Claimants in support of this position. Deprivation of Claimants\u2019 rights occurred as early as December 2004 when municipalities refused to grant Rodipet the concessions.\n\n297.\n\nClaimants suffered from a creeping expropriation, the first step being the revocation of the Concession by reason of the Constitutional Court judgment, culminated when AVAS unilaterally and without legal grounds imposed itself as shareholder holding 51% of Rodipet by enforcing the Pledge under the Privatization Contract, a process intervening from September 2008 to June 2009. These actions had the effect of depriving Claimants of the benefit of their investment, in breach of Article III(1) of the BIT.\n\n298.\n\nUnder international law, the doctrine of acquired or vested rights is well-established as a customary norm. ICSID tribunals have emphasized that domestic legislation may not take away without equitable compensation under international law accrued rights of foreign investors in application of the principles of good faith, estoppel, and *venire contra factum proprium.* Regardless of the ex post declaration of unconstitutionality of Law 442, Rodipet has vested patrimonial rights under Article 8 of the Ordinance No. 45 introduced by said Law. Reference is made by Claimants in that regard to *Raibl, Liamco, Aramco,* and other international cases as well as to doctrinal writings.364\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 252-259.\n\n299.\n\nLaw 442 merely applied the possibility to be granted a concession for 49 years provided by Article 32(3) of GEO No. 88/1997 and Articles 130-138 of Ordinance 577. The constitutionality of Article 32(3) of GEO 88/19997 was challenged in 2004 on the same ground of violation of the Constitution because it diminished the municipalities\u2019 autonomy by forcing them to grant direct concessions without auctions. The claims were rejected by the Constitutional Court that declared Art. 32(3) of GEO 88/1997 to be constitutional by Decision 566/2004365 dated 20 December 2004. Likewise, by Decision 720/2009 of 7 May 2009, the Constitutional Court declared constitutional Article 32(l)(3) of GEO 88/1997.366\n\nCLA-37.\n\nCLA-80.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe relevant legal framework, as reported by Respondent, consists of \"three layers of legislation.\" First is the general regime for concessions found in **Law No. 219/1998.** The law defines the maximum duration of concessions. It provides that assets found in the public property of the State, county, city, or village are to be allotted directly by concession agreement without a tender process to the State-owned companies which administered the assets, with royalties to be paid in a manner established in the concession agreement.367\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 109.\n\n301.\n\nSecond are special rules on concessions which concern companies that were passing from State ownership to private ownership. These rules are found in **Government Emergency Ordinance No. 88/1997** and, as implementing legislation, **Government Decision No. 577/2002.** Under Decision No. 577/2002, lands in the public domain of the State or administrative territorial units are granted directly by concession agreement to the privatized companies that hold such lands for a period of 49 years with a possible extension of 24 years and 6 months, if the lands are strictly necessary for the companies to conduct their activity. Lands in the private domain of the State or administrative territorial units that are not granted by concession are leased or sold to the company that holds them by direct negotiation without prior advertising.368\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 122; CLA-5.\n\n302.\n\nThird is a specific derogation granted to Rodipet set out in **Law 442/2004.369**\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 102, C-10.\n\n303.\n\nRespondent notes that **GEO No. 88/1997** and **Decision No. 577/2002** constituted the legal regime which governed Rodipet at the time of entry into force of the Privatization Contract.370\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 115.\n\n304.\n\nRespondent challenges Claimants\u2019 misleading allegations regarding their request for a \"rent-free\" concession. According to Respondent, Law 442 did not itself grant any concessions but provided a legal framework for municipalities to grant concessions to Rodipet.371 Respondent agrees that the reaction of the municipalities was varied. Some did not require the payment of a royalty for the concessions, but most did. However, free concessions were never requested by Claimants, the \"contractual balance\" relied upon by them372 consisting in a company with a dominant market position in an important sector of society, accompanied by a huge amount of State aid.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 119-124.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 54.\n\n305.\n\nAVAS\u2019 original undertaking regarding the enactment of a law granting the 49-year concession was replaced by Addendum No. 2 to the Privatization Contract with a best-efforts clause, leaving Magnar as the owner of Rodipet with full contractual obligations and no new concession should the best efforts fail.\n\n306.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"the first three years of post-privatization monitoring were unexceptional.\"373 The Competition Council authorized State aid to Rodipet in May 2006 with conditions mostly relating to a restructuring plan that Rodipet undertook to implement and that was approved noting that about 6% of the total costs of the restructuring were covered by Magnar and Rodipet.374 Compensatory measures to prevent excessive distortion of competition were set out mostly relating to selling capacities.375\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 93.\n\nDecision of the Competition Council dated 29 May 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28 and 30 (C-50).\n\nDecision of the Competition Council dated 29 May 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 63 and 65.\n\n307.\n\nAVAS proceeded to monitor Magnar\u2019s fulfilment of its obligations under the Privatization Contract and Rodipet\u2019s fulfilment of its obligation under the restructuring plan, two different departments within AVAS being responsible for these tasks. Law 442 was enacted providing for Rodipet\u2019s right to enter into negotiations with municipalities for concession for lands on which its kiosks are located. In all, Rodipet concluded 150 concession contracts with the municipalities.\n\n308.\n\nFive municipalities challenged the constitutionality of Law 442. The first two challenges were rejected, the third and fourth challenges were upheld, and the fifth became moot. The third and fourth challenges, which changed the situation, were successful on the basis of Decision 823/2008 of 7 July 2008 and Decision 884/2008 of 10 July 2008, when the Constitutional Court ruled that Law 442 was unconstitutional. Existing concessions continued in force, as Claimants admit.376 The burden is for Claimants to show that prior to Law 442 being struck down there was a request by Rodipet for a concession that was denied and that this was not overturned by Romanian courts.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 308.\n\n309.\n\nClaimants\u2019 complaints regarding the Constitutional Court Decision 823/2008 are misplaced in light of new documents filed by Claimants themselves showing that the concessions were not important to Rodipet. An independent report from mid-2008 states that Rodipet\u2019s losses of EUR 700,000 per month were caused by a reduction in selling workstation due to lack of personnel, salary increases, and irregularities found inside the company.377 Even if there had been losses, they would have flowed not to Rodipet but to Rodikiosk to which all rights under the concessions had been leased, even if not permitted.\n\nAccounting expertise report undated (C-470).\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nAccording to the new Article 8 introduced by Article 53 of Law 442 to Ordinance N. 45/2004, lands for kiosks *\"will be given\"* to Rodipet *\"by means of a concession contract\"* (Article 8(1)) *\"without drafting a study of opportunity or a tender book\" \"through direct negotiation between the transferor and the company\"* (Article 8(2)), for *\"a term of maximum 49years, with an automatic extension of 24years and 6 months\"* (Article 8(3)).\n\n311.\n\nThe concession was for lands where kiosks were already installed (with the exclusion of those located in Bucharest) and for lands where kiosks will be placed *\"to meet the investment programme assumed by the Contract of Sale-Purchase of Shares\"* (Article 8(4)).378\n\nShortly after Law 442 entered into force, Magnar notified AVAS of its investment plan regarding the new kiosks, requesting AVAS\u2019 approval of this plan (Letter from Magnar to AVAS dated 14 December 2004, C-83). According to Claimants, by 14 December 2004 the land concession under Law 442 \"was fully operational\" (Cl. Mem., \u00b6 105).\n\n312.\n\nLaw 442 was enacted on 28 October 2004 by the Romanian Parliament as a result of AVAS\u2019 commitment under Amendment No. 2 of the Privatization Contract *\"to make all reasonable efforts for the issuance of a normative document stipulating the granting to the Company... for a period of 49years, of the lands... relating to the points of sale existing on Romanian\u2019s territory\"* (Article 3).\n\n313.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether the original term of concessions under Law 442 would be of 49 years, as contended by Claimants, or \"up to\" 49 years, as contended by Respondent. According to Claimants, the word \"maximum\" merely indicates that the initial term could not go beyond a time period of 49 years, as confirmed by the automatic extension for one-half of such term and by courts\u2019 decisions rejecting Rodipet\u2019s request for a 49-year concession for the reason that such long period of time and its extension would mean a deprivation of ownership contrary to the Constitution.379 Respondent asserts that the word \"maximum\" cannot but mean what it says and that this term represented the outcome of AVAS\u2019 \"all reasonable efforts\" commitment.380\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 106.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 122.\n\n314.\n\nTo the extent the initial term of the concession may have a bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s determinations, the reference to a term of 49 years made by some Romanian courts to hold that this long duration contravened the Constitution as representing a \"deprival of ownership,\" appears to favour Claimants\u2019 interpretation.381 This was confirmed by the Constitutional Court\u2019s holding that the reference to a 49-year duration and its extension \"represents a deprival of ownership as it does not observe the proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized.\"382 No doubt, this finding also points to a 49-year initial term rather than to any period between one and forty-nine years.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 106, bullet point \"Third\", n.8l.\n\nDecision no. 823 of the Constitutional Court dated 7 July 2008 (C-15, p. 2 of the English text).\n\n315.\n\nOn the contrary, there is no suggestion under Law 442 or by Romanian courts\u2019 decisions that the concessions had to be rent-free, as contended by Claimants and denied by Respondent.\n\n316.\n\nOn 7 July 2008, the Romanian Constitutional Court, by Decision 823/2008, declared Law 442 unconstitutional holding that the concession contravened the right of the municipalities and of the State to freely dispose of their property. This decision caused the Romanian courts to reject Rodipet\u2019s pending claims for a concession under Law 442 and the municipalities to deny Rodipet\u2019s pending requests for a concession under that law.\n\n317.\n\nThe repeal of Law 442 is at the root of Claimants\u2019 claim that Romania breached the BIT and customary international law, thus triggering their right to compensation. More specifically, it is Claimants\u2019 position that the Romanian government and legislator did not protect their investments by failing to enact interpretative norms so as to prevent the municipalities\u2019 abusive misinterpretation of Law 442 as a ground for the refusal to grant concessions to Rodipet and, further, by failing to correct the alleged unconstitutionality of Articles 8(1) to 8(5) of Law 442.\n\n318.\n\nThe first question to be examined is whether AVAS\u2019 commitment under Addendum No. 2 to the Privatization Contract to \"make all reasonable efforts for the issuance of a normative act\" was satisfied by just the issuance of Law 442 or if it implied also a commitment to see to it that the law would be regularly implemented by the municipalities according to its terms and that, once repealed by the Constitutional Court, the alleged unconstitutionality be corrected. Requests to that effect had been repeatedly addressed by Claimants to AVAS, the Government and the Parliament to no avail in view of the refusal of these various institutions to intervene. The latter institution had replied that \"the legislature is not empowered to exercise control over court decisions and decisions of the Constitutional Court,\"383 while the Government invoked \"the constitutional principle of separation of powers\"384 to refuse to intervene.\n\nLetter of the President of the Romanian Senate to Rodipet and Magnar dated 6 November 2008 (C-211).\n\nLetter by General Secretariat of Government to Rodipet dated 12 November 2008 (C-212). The Government even supported the unconstitutionality of Law 442 by filing submissions to that effect (CPHB, \u00b6 45).\n\n319.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s refusal to further intervene was in breach of AVAS\u2019 commitment under Addendum No. 2 to use \"all reasonable efforts,\" such commitment demanding further interventions whenever a prospect of positive outcome would have been realistic, as it appears would have been the case.\n\n320.\n\nThe same Constitutional Court had in fact indicated that an alternative solution would have been available in its decision of 7 July 2008. Having found that Law 442, by restricting the right of disposal of property by public authorities \"prejudges the constitutional principle whereby public property is guaranteed and protected by law,\" the Court held the following:\n\n*In accordance with the provisions contained in Article 73 of paragraph (3) subparagraph (m) of the Constitution, the general status of property may be regulated by [an] organic law. But the Court holds that Law No. 442 under review is an ordinary law, as adopted by the Romanian Parliament in compliance with Article 76 paragraph (2) of the Constitution....385*\n\nCl. Mem, \u00b6 217. The Tribunal lias noted Professor Mihai\u2019s, Respondent\u2019s legal expert, opinion that anorganic law would not have been sufficient to meet the Constitutional requirements in view of the presence, in addition to what he defines an \"extrinsic\" problem, also of \"intrinsic\" problems of conformity with the Constitution of any law disposing of public property, so that both Parliament and Government were \"virtually precluded to do so\" (First Legal Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 161-162). No mention of these other problems had been made by the Constitutional Court when referring to the need of an organic law. As noted by Claimants, further options would have been available if an organic law would not have solved the constitutional defects of Law 442 (CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61), but the Government and the Parliament chose not to act.\n\n321.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that there is a breach by AVAS of its commitment under Addendum No. 2 \"to make all reasonable efforts for the issuance of a normative document stipulating the granting to the Company by the State and the administrative-territorial units... of land owned by the latter and relating to the points of sale existing on Romanian territory.\" Whether AVAS\u2019 breach is attributable to Respondent and, if so, what would be the BIT breach by Romania is now to be determined.\n\n322.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, AVAS\u2019 conduct is attributable to Respondent. The Privatization Contract was concluded in the frame of the State\u2019s privatization policy by a state organ, the \"Authority for Privatization and Management of State\u2019s Shares\" - AVAS. The pursuance by AVAS of the public interest in concluding and implementing the Privatization Contract is underlined by a certain number of contractual provisions. Even if the Purpose of the Contract under Article 2 is the sale by AVAS to Magnar of 100% of the shares in Rodipet, both parties undertook additional obligations which may only be explained by the underlying public interest. Among these obligations are the extinction by conversion into shares of liabilities due by Rodipet to the State for taxes, fees, contributions, and the like (as provided in one of the Suspension Conditions), the assumption by Magnar of technological and upgrading investments for five years for a total of EUR 3,750,000 (under Article 14) as well as the \"Other commitments\" listed in Article 17 and in the Appendices to the Privatization Contract, including the maintenance for a given period of the current number of employees (Appendix No. 4).\n\n323.\n\nWhen signing the Privatization Contract, AVAS acted therefore as a State organ for the pursuance of the State\u2019s interest in view of the implementation of the Romanian privatization plan, therefore not merely in a private law capacity. As such, AVAS\u2019 acts under the Contract are attributable to the State under international law based on Article 4 of the International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts providing that the conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial, or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n324.\n\nThe further question in the process of identifying Respondent\u2019s breach under the BIT is whether the right to obtain concession contracts under Law 442 is an \"investment\" for purposes of the BIT. Claimants\u2019 answer is in the affirmative, relying in particular on Article 1.1 (a)(iv) of the BIT which defines \"investment\" as including \"any right conferred by law or contract, including concessions to search for, extract, or exploit natural resources, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.\" The State and the municipalities had in fact the obligation to directly assign the land by concluding a concession agreement with no discretionary power, both for existing and future kiosks.386 According to Respondent, Law 442 did not grant any \"concession\" but only a legal framework for the negotiations for concession agreements by avoiding tender requirements.387\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 101-104.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 116-119.\n\n325.\n\nThe \"investment\" in our case is not a \"concession\" as a regulatory act granting a party the right to use or exploit State property (such as a mining concession). What was granted by Law 442 was the right to conclude concession contracts based on direct negotiation for a maximum period of 49 years, with an automatic extension for 24 years and 6 months, on rates that had to be agreed on a case by case basis. According to Respondent, these were the terms AVAS succeeded to obtain under the \"all reasonable efforts\" clause. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the requirements for qualifying Rodipet\u2019s right to conclude concession contracts as an \"investment,\" as this term is defined by the BIT, are not met. This is sufficient to exclude that the repeal of Law 442 amounted to expropriation, as contended by Claimants.388\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 237-246.\n\n326.\n\nThis does not exclude a BIT breach by Romania, AVAS\u2019 actions being attributable to the State as mentioned above. Which standard of treatment was breached by Respondent in this case? The following may be considered in this regard. The deprivation of Claimants\u2019 right to be granted concessions was due to an act valid under Romanian law, the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision repealing Law 442. The decision was not invalid or so egregiously wrong under international law as to leave room for a finding of a denial of justice or of an arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, as held by some investment treaty cases.389\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca* v. *The United Mexicain States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, \u00b6 99 (CLA-24); *Mr. Franck Charles Arif* v. *Republic of Moldova,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, 8 April 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 453-454 (CLA-413).\n\n327.\n\nAs stated by an investment treaty tribunal, \"[a]n ICSID Tribunal will not act as an instance to review matters of domestic law in the manner of a court of higher instance. Instead, the Tribunal will accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies, in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from the viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of justice.\"390\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S* v. *Arab Republic ofEsvpt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award, 3 July 2008, \u00b6 106 (RLA-56).\n\n328.\n\nUnder Article III(l) of the BIT, \"[i]nvestments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization....\" Since the right under Law 442 to obtain concession on lands belonging to the State or the municipalities may not be qualified as an \"investment\" for the reasons mentioned above, the repeal of Law 442 by the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision was not an act of expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investments, as asserted by Claimants.391 The Concession granted under Law 442 before its repeal remained in force, Claimants being deprived only of the right to obtain concessions on terms that had to be agreed with the granting authority.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 226-227; Cl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 600-601.\n\n329.\n\nThe repeal of Law 442 and Respondent\u2019s failure to put in place alternative measures to protect Claimants\u2019 right under the Privatization Contract to obtain concessions, as required by AVAS\u2019 \"all reasonable efforts\" commitment under Addendum No. 2, gave rise to a situation that frustrated Claimants\u2019 reliance on Law 442 to develop its investment plan within Romania.\n\n330.\n\nAs acknowledged also by AVAS,392 Claimants relied on the privatization regime provided by the Romanian legislation when planning to invest in Rodipet, as they have contended on numerous occasions before AVAS, Romanian courts and Romanian counties and municipalities.393\n\nAVAS\u2019 Memorandum addressed to the Government on 28 July 2004 (C-55).\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 126-128.\n\n331.\n\nCertainly, Claimants\u2019 contention that the granting of concessions was a *\"sine qua non* condition\" requested by Magnar to purchase Rodipet394 is contradicted by the acceptance of AVAS\u2019 diluted commitment only to exercise \"all reasonable efforts\" to obtain to that effect a normative act. However, once Law 442 had been enacted, this circumstance founded Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations to obtain on that basis a concession on lands on which kiosks where located and future kiosks would be located, so that Rodipet\u2019s activities and investment plans could be developed.395\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 109.\n\nLetter from Magnar to AVAS dated 19 July 2004 (C- 54).\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s failure to remedy the repeal of Law 442 by enacting an organic law or an alternative normative act to the same effect breached the BIT, specifically Articles Il(2)(a)(b) and XII under which the State and its political subdivisions had assumed the obligation to accord at all times fair and equitable treatment to Claimants\u2019 investments and not to impair the maintenance and enjoyment of such investments. At the time of the repeal of Law 442, Claimants had made investments regarding Rodipet, as it has been determined above.396\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 265.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that Respondent is liable to compensate Claimants for the breach of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT in relation to the repeal of Law 442, and that compensation should take into consideration that Law 442 was, as Claimants have persuasively argued, at the cornerstone of their investment and legitimate expectations. Respondent has contended that the termination of the Privatization Contract determined the breaking of the causal link with obligations due by it thereunder, including with regard to Law 442.397 The Tribunal notes that a causal link may not be broken concerning a breach of obligations under the BIT that had already intervened when the Privatization Contact was terminated, as it was the case regarding the repeal of Law 442. In other words, Respondent\u2019s breach of its fair and equitable treatment obligations in relation to Law 442 occurred, for purposes of legal and economic causation, prior to any breach by Claimants of investment and social obligations.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 616; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 577-580.\n\n**C. Enforcement of the Pledge**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n334.\n\nAccording to Article 15.4 of the Privatization Contract, the enforcement of the Pledge granted by Magnar in favor of AVAS over Rodipet\u2019s shares under the Share Pledge Agreement could only occur should Magnar fail to comply with the financial obligations set forth in the five-year investment plan under Article 14.1. Since Claimants had fulfilled all the financial obligations, AVAS could not enforce the Pledge.\n\n335.\n\nHowever, without notifying Magnar in advance of its decision giving it an opportunity to be heard on the matter, on 17 March 2009, AVAS decided to enforce the Pledge. On 27 March 2009, Magnar, upon becoming aware through the media of AVAS\u2019 decision, sent a letter to AVAS underlining that the decision was not justified since it had fully complied with its financial obligations, attaching the relevant documentation and advising that the documentation certifying the investment for the Fifth Investment Year would be sent by the due date, *i.e.* 10 May 2009.398 Magnar reiterated further to AVAS its compliance with all financial obligations under the Privatization Contract by letter of 3 April 20 09.399\n\nLetter from Magnar to AVAS dated 27 March 2009 (C-19; C-67).\n\nLetter from Magnar to AVAS dated 3 April 2009 (C-213).\n\n336.\n\nInstead of responding to Magnar\u2019s documentation and objections, AVAS registered on 3 April 2009 a request with Bucharest Trade Registry Office requiring the latter to approve AVAS\u2019 reregistration as shareholder of Rodipet for a number of shares representing 51% of the Company\u2019s share capital.400 At a meeting convened on 7 April 2009 at AVAS\u2019 headquarters, Magnar presented again its objections. As indicated by the minutes of the meeting,401 the parties were in disagreement regarding the interpretation of Article 15.4 of the Privatization Contract, providing for AVAS\u2019 entitlement \"to entirely execute the pledge on the shares if Magnar does not comply with its obligations under Article 14.1 in any stage of the investment.\"\n\nRequest from AVAS to the Trade Registry Office dated 3 April 2009 (C 214).\n\nMinutes of meeting held between Magnar and AVAS on 7 April 2009 (C-215).\n\n337.\n\nBy letter of 14 April 2009, Magnar reaffirmed that it had complied with its investment obligations.402 As anticipated by the minutes of the meeting on 24 April 2009,403 Magnar provided an additional certificate for the Fourth Year dated 9 January 2OO9404 and an additional one dated 2 February 2009 for the Fifth Investment Year.405 However, AVAS did not suspend the process of the enforcement of the Pledge nor gave Magnar an opportunity to rectify its concerns. By letters of 16 April 2OO9406 and 7 May 2OO9,407 AVAS requested Rodipet to cooperate to be registered as majority shareholder. Only by letter of 1 June 2OO9,408 did AVAS inform Magnar of its opinion that these documents did not meet certain formalistic requirements. However, the substance the documents attest was not disputed.\n\nLetter from Magnar to AVAS dated 14 April 2009 (C-218).\n\nLetter from Magnar to AVAS dated 24 April 2009 (C-232).\n\nCertificate dated 9 January 2009 (C-68).\n\nCertificate dated 2 February 2009 (C-69).\n\nLetter from AVAS to SC Network Press dated 16 April 2009 (C-219).\n\nLetter from AVAS to SC Network Press dated 7 May 2009 (C-220).\n\nLetter from AVAS to Magnar dated 1 June 2009 (C-235).\n\n338.\n\nMagnar requested, on 6 May 2009, the Delegate Judge to deny AVAS\u2019 request challenging its jurisdiction. On 2 June 2009, the Delegate Judge rejected Magnar\u2019s intervention claim and approved AVAS\u2019 request to be registered as majority shareholder.409 Magnar\u2019s appeal of the Delegate Judge\u2019s decisions was rejected by the Bucharest Court of Appeals on 2 December 2009.\n\nDecision of the Delegate Judge of the Trade Registry in Bucharest dated 2 June 2009 (C-222).\n\n339.\n\nUnder Article 15.4 of the Privatization Contract, enforcement of the Pledge may only be triggered in case of Magnar\u2019s failure to comply with the financial investment obligations under Article 14.1 *(i.e.* EUR 3,750,000 invested in five investment years). Claimants assert to have duly and completely fulfilled their obligations in that regard, as shown by payment orders submitted to the Trade Registry,410 a Partnership Agreement of 8 November 2006 between Magnar and Rodipet411 and the share capital increase registered with the Trade Registry on 12 January 2OO7.412\n\nPayment orders (C-226).\n\nPartnership Agreement No. 6 dated 8 November 2006 (C-227).\n\nIncrease in Share Capital registered with Trade Registry Office on 12 January 2007 (C-228).\n\n340.\n\nTo enforce the Pledge, AVAS relied rather on Article 14.3 which required Magnar to provide AVAS certain certificates attesting that investments had been made. Failure to meet this obligation does not trigger enforcement of the Pledge. It is not true, as stated by AVAS, that Magnar *\"did not show any paper regarding the achievement of the fourth investment\"* since on 12 September 2008 a certificate was submitted, as referred to in the Minutes of Meeting with AVAS of 7 April 2OO9.413\n\n*Supra,* n.401 (C-215).\n\n341.\n\nA formalistic requirement such as the one provided by Article 14.3 may not trigger such a radical sanction as the transfer of ownership, considering also that under Article 14.4 the delayed submission of documents under Article 14.3 would trigger a penalty as a sanction. The principle of proportionality is provided by Article 53 of the Romanian Constitution.\n\n342.\n\nProcedural propriety was not complied with by either AVAS or the Delegate Judge of the Trade Registry in enforcing the Pledge, AVAS by failing to provide notice of the intent to enforce the Pledge and the Delegate Judge by refusing Magnar\u2019s intervention claim.\n\n343.\n\nClearly, AVAS\u2019 acts are attributable to Romania under Article 4(1) of the ILC Draft Articles. Accordingly, Romania may be held liable for violations of the BIT committed by AVAS through the enforcement of the Pledge by AVAS.\n\n344.\n\nThe enforcement of the Pledge by AVAS breached Article II(2) of the BIT providing for fair and equitable treatment (FET) to be accorded to investment. As mentioned by the tribunal *MTD* v. *Chile* referring to Judge Schwebel\u2019s definition, FET is *\"a broad and widely accepted standard encompassing such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, nondiscrimination and proportionality.\"* Other investment treaty cases are referred to by Claimants to identify the content of the FET standard.\n\n345.\n\nAVAS failed to act in a consistent manner in the treatment of Claimants\u2019 investments in breach of the FET by failing to express concerns or issues regarding certificates relating the first three investment years, to then raise in the 1 June 2009 letter trivial irregularities for the following years as a pretext to enforce the Pledge. As to the fifth year certificate, AVAS should not have concluded that it was invalid since it had been submitted before the maturity date so that Magnar still had an opportunity to rectify it.\n\n346.\n\nRomania has consistently failed to protect Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations by failing to act in a transparent and coherent manner with regard to their investment. Instead of supporting their investment, as Claimants expected Romania would do, Romania used its best effort to undermine and eventually destroy their investment.\n\n347.\n\nDue process was violated by the State\u2019s failure to follow the correct procedures in seeking to enforce the Pledge, first by failing to provide effective notice, then to deprive Claimants of any effective means by which it could defend their rights by disregarding the documents provided by Claimants. AVAS\u2019 actions in enforcing the Pledge were not proportional to the minor infractions alleged.\n\n348.\n\nAVAS\u2019 failure to act in a transparent and consistent manner is a demonstration of the arbitrary treatment of the investment in breach of Article Il(2)(b) of the BIT. Arbitrariness is shown also by the ever changing grounds relied upon by AVAS to enforce the Pledge.\n\n349.\n\nBy the illegitimate execution of the Pledge AVAS deprived the investor of the benefit of its investment placing it in the possession of the Respondent. It is well established that expropriation is unlawful when certain conditions fail to be met. These conditions are reflected by Article III of the BIT. No compensation was provided nor was expropriation in this case made pursuant to a public purpose.\n\n350.\n\nThe taking of Rodipet\u2019s shares was not made for any legitimate public purpose but was an intentional act to deprive Claimants of their investment. Reference is made in this regard to the holding of the IC SID tribunals in *ADC* v. *Hungary, Middle East* v. *Egypt,* and *Siag & Vecchi* v. *Egypt,* holding that inadequacies regarding notice of the State\u2019s intention in order for the investor to be able to protect its rights violate due process requirements. The principle of proportionality, as defined in *Occidental* v. *Ecuador,* was also breached, the sanction imposed upon Claimants having been out of proportion to the alleged wrongdoing.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n351.\n\nAVAS proceeded to monitor Magnar\u2019s fulfilment of its obligations under the Privatization Contract and Rodipet\u2019s fulfilment of its obligation under the restructuring plan, two different departments within AVAS being responsible for these tasks. Law 442 was enacted providing for Rodipet\u2019s right to enter into negotiations with municipalities for concessions for lands on which its kiosks were located.\n\n352.\n\nThe situation changed in 2008 when the Constitutional Court ruled that Law 442 was unconstitutional. Existing concessions continued in force, as Claimants admit.414 The burden is for Claimants to prove that prior to Law 442 being struck down, there was a request by Rodipet for concessions that was denied and that this was not overturned by Romanian courts.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 308.\n\n353.\n\nClaimants\u2019 complaints regarding the Constitutional Court Decision 823/2008 are misplaced in light of the new documents filed by Claimants themselves showing that the concessions were not important to Rodipet. An independent report from mid-2008 states that Rodipet\u2019s losses of EUR 700,000 per month were caused by a reduction in selling workstation due to lack of personnel, salary increases and irregularities found inside the company.415 Even if there had been losses, they would have flowed not to Rodipet but to Rodikiosk to which all rights under the concessions had been leased even if not permitted.\n\nAccounting expertise report undated (C-470).\n\n354.\n\nAVAS\u2019 decision to enforce the Pledge on 51% of Rodipet\u2019s shares was the result of a series of notices given to Magnar starting in mid-2008, at the time when Magnar had to submit the certificate evidencing compliance with the investment obligation for the Fourth Year. Having received no reply from Magnar to a request made on 7 July 2OO8,416 on 8 October 2OO8,417 AVAS warned Magnar about the sanctions provided by the Privatization Contract in case of failure to observe the clauses on investment performance.\n\nApproval from AVAS to Rodipet to sell properties dated 7 July 2008 (CPM-10).\n\nLetter from AVAS to Magnar and Rodipet dated 8 October 2008 (R-22l).\n\n355.\n\nThe certificate provided by Magnar on 12 September 2008, allegedly acknowledging compliance of the Fourth Investment Year,418 is in fact a letter with tables of invoices relating to Rodipet\u2019s Competition Council mandated restructuring, sent to AVAS by Rodipet.419 It has nothing to do with the periodic auditors\u2019 certificate due under Article 14.3 of the Privatization Contract.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 92 and 349.\n\n\"Investment Report\" No. 92/8335 from Rodipet to AVAS dated 12 September 2008 (R-222).\n\n356.\n\nDespite being made fully aware by not less than 10 letters by AVAS of the way in which Rodipet and Magnar were expected to prove compliance with the restructuring plan, documents were transmitted to AVAS in a chaotic fashion both as to form to be used and as to substance (regarding required information).420 After the transmission by Rodipet of documents that did not comply with the applicable requirements, on 12 September 2008, Rodipet provided a set of invoices accompanied by \"datasheet\" in order to establish implementation of the restructuring plan.421 However, this document and its attachments were entirely insufficient.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.\n\n\"Investment Report\" from Rodipet to AVAS dated 12 September 2008 (R-222). The same document was filed in this arbitration as evidence of Magnar\u2019s compliance with its post-privatization investment obligations: Resp. Rej., \u00b6 89.\n\n357.\n\nFollowing a comprehensive analysis of the situation, including the lack of response to AVAS\u2019 letters from July and October 2008 as well as the failed control at Rodipet\u2019s office on 26 November 2008 requesting in vain documents that had not been provided to AVAS,422 considering the ample opportunities given to Magnar to demonstrate its compliance with the investment and social obligations under, respectively, Articles 14.1 and 10.9 of the Privatization Contract, AVAS\u2019 Board of Directors decided, on 17 March 2009, to call the Pledge.\n\nAVAS Control Note No. P/7003 on performing verifications at the registered office of Rodipet dated 15 December 2008 (R-225).\n\n358.\n\nMagnar, informed of AVAS\u2019 decision to enforce the Pledge on 24 March 2OO9,423 protested by two letters of 27 March 2009, attaching for the first time a purported certificate from its auditors stating fulfilment of the Fourth Investment Year obligation.424\n\nLetter from AVAS to Magnar dated 24 March 2009 (C-18).\n\nLetter from Magnar to AVAS dated 27 March 2009 (C-19); Letter from Magnar to AVAS dated 27 March 2009 (C-67) (without enclosure) and Letter from Magnar to AVAS dated 27 March 2009 (R-223) (with enclosure).\n\n359.\n\nIn the course of a meeting with AVAS held on 7 April 2009, Magnar undertook to provide evidence and missing documents within 10 days and sent more documents to AVAS on 24 April 2009, arguing that they provided certificates by chartered auditors *Contextpert* for the Fourth425 and the Fifth426 Years as well as a cumulative certificate for the entirety of the investment obligations. These documents however did not prove fulfilment of the investment obligation, as concluded by AVAS\u2019 legal department on 7 May 2OO9427 due to their failure to comply with the legal provisions. As testified also by Mariana Predescu, the Director of AVAS\u2019s Post-Privatization Department, those certificates raised a number of questions as to the veracity of the investments.428\n\nCertificate dated 9 January 2009 (C-68).\n\nCertificate dated 2 February 2009 (C-69).\n\nMinutes issued by AVAS - General Legal Department dated 7 May 2009 (C-234).\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mariana Predescu, \u00b6 61, referred to by Resp. Answers, \u00b6 56.\n\n360.\n\nOn 30 June 2009, a delegate judge ordered that AVAS be registered as shareholder of 51% of the shares of Rodipet. Claimants appealed the order, but their appeal was rejected.\n\n361.\n\nIn a meeting with the union representatives and Rodipet on 27 April 2009, AVAS received further evidence of breach of the social obligations. By a letter received one week later, AVAS was informed of Rodipet\u2019s and Magnar\u2019s failure to pay salaries and meal vouchers, which later proved to be true. Further to the call on the Pledge, AVAS terminated the Privatization Contract under Article 10.10 for Magnar\u2019 failure to comply with the obligation to maintain the agreed number of employees, notifying Magnar of this decision on 13 July 2OO9.429\n\nNotification from AVAS to Magnar dated 13 July 2009 (R-244).\n\n362.\n\nHaving become the majority shareholder of Rodipet, AVAS appointed C\u00e2t\u00e2lin Ni(u as provisional administrator of the company. According to Respondent, Claimants refused to collaborate with C\u00e2t\u00e2lin Ni\u2021u. As a result, he filed a criminal complaint against Claimants. The financial situation of Rodipet was such that the company was declared insolvent by the Court of Bucharest on 16 October 2009. Twelve creditors of Rodipet filed for insolvency. On 16 December 2009, Cornel Florea, of Consulta 99 SPRL, was appointed as judicial administrator of Rodipet (receiver) to oversee the insolvency proceedings and the liquidation of Rodipet. By unanimous decision of Rodipet shareholders, including Magnar, On 8 February 2010, Vasile Uifalean was appointed to be Special Administrator of Rodipet and represent shareholders in the insolvency proceedings.430\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 303, (R-25l).\n\n363.\n\nRomanian authorities became aware of the Awdi Group\u2019s actions as a result of tax cross-control carried out in April and May 2009 and a full tax audit of Rodipet, completed in October - November 2009, during which numerous failures to report and pay applicable taxes were discovered. ANAF, the tax authority, calculated the total tax liability for unpaid tax and penalties at approximately EUR 52.3 million and filed criminal complaints with DIICOT.\n\n364.\n\nThree DIICOT investigations were opened. The first (38/D/P/2011) concerned CFR-Messagerie, with Hassan Awdi and others being indicted for embezzlement, money laundering, and other crimes. The second (390/D/P/2006) was to establish whether acts committed in the running of the Awdi Group of companies fulfil the criteria for the crimes of running a criminal organization, embezzlement, tax evasion, and money laundering, focusing on suspicious money transactions by which funds and assets were siphoned from Rodipet. The third (304/D/P/2008) concerned the human trafficking for forced labor.\n\n365.\n\nIt is in the context of the investigation regarding Rodipet that on 22 June 2010, based on search warrants issued by the Criminal Chamber of the Bucharest Tribunal, searches were conducted and documents seized. Inventories were made of the materials seized which were completed in February 2011 so that most of the documents (over 90%) could be returned to their owners. Subsequently, DIICOT also searched the electronic devices seized with the help of an expert.\n\n366.\n\nOnce Rodipet\u2019s financial situation was clarified and the \"outsourcing policy\" of the Awdi Group was discovered leading to the company\u2019s demise, Rodipet\u2019s administrators sought to cancel a number of agreements transferring assets to other companies in the Awdi Group and to have Supremo, Balbec, Rodipet Courier and others struck off from the list of creditors.\n\n367.\n\nRodipet was left as a bare shell, AVAS being unable to recover the contractual penalties due under the Privatization Contract since Magnar was placed in insolvency on February 2011.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the enforcement of the Pledge in 2009 was justified under the circumstances that prevailed at the time the decision was taken by AVAS. It is worth recalling that according to Article 14.3 of the Privatization Contract the investment made for each Investment Year had to be certified by Magnar within 30 bank days from the due date under Appendix No. 6 by a certificate issued by Rodipet\u2019s censors or a specialised audit company.\n\n369.\n\nFor each Investment Year the due date was 10 May, the deadline for the filing by Magnar of the required certificate being therefore (depending on the applicable bank-day period) not later than 21 June.431 While the relevant deadline had been complied with for each of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Investment Years,432 this was not the case for the 4th and 5th Investment Years.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88,91.\n\nAVAS Internal Note dated 6 February 2009 (C- 53, pp.51-52).\n\n370.\n\nTwo notices had been addressed by AVAS to Magnar requesting compliance for the 4th Investment Year. The first notice was sent on 7 July 2008 in the context of AVAS\u2019 approval of the sale of properties by Rodipet, requesting documents to prove compliance in the frame of the approval of the sale of the properties.433 No reply by Magnar followed.\n\nCPM-10, pp. 5-6.\n\n371.\n\nThe second notice was sent by AVAS to Magnar on 8 October 2008, requesting a number of documents regarding the fulfilment of the 4th year contractual obligations, with a specific warning concerning sanctions under the Privatization Contract in case of failure to perform investments and to provide documents attesting their fulfilment.434 Penalties for delay under both Articles 14.4 and 15.5 and enforcement of the Pledge under Article 15.4 are \"sanctions\" for purposes of the Privatization Contract. The warning to Magnar was therefore clear and of a certain duration. Also this second notice remained without response by Magnar.\n\nLetter from AVAS to Magnar and Rodipet dated 8 October 2008 (R-22l).\n\n372.\n\nClaimants\u2019 denial to have received the two notifications is contradicted by Magnar\u2019s and Rodipet\u2019s signature for receipt of the two letters.435\n\nR- 356 and R-357 respectively; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 241; Resp. Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n373.\n\nOn 12 September 2008, Rodipet provided a certificate allegedly showing compliance with the 4th Investment Year obligation under Appendix No. 6 to the Privatization Contract.436 However, such certificate had nothing to do with investment obligation due during the 4th year since it related to Rodipet\u2019s mandatory restructuring obligation to the Competition Council. As a matter of fact, it was addressed to AVAS by Rodipet, not by Magnar, showing amounts and breakdown in a table that did not match the amounts to be invested by Magnar for the 4th year under Appendix No. 6. This document being only a collection of datasheet listing invoices, therefore had nothing to do with the certification due for each Investment Year.\n\nLetter from Rodipet to AVAS dated 12 September 2008 (R-222).\n\n374.\n\nRegarding the document in question, Florin Lungaci, Rodipet\u2019s General Manager, was subject to cross examination during the hearing of 29 October 2013. He insisted on the relevance of this document as evidence of the fulfilment of the 4th Year Investment obligations437 despite the fact that it had nothing to do with that matter, as it clearly emerged at the hearing. Magnar itself appears to concede this when stating in its letter to AVAS of 27 March 2009 that the document filed with the letter of 12 September 2008 \"could be informal.\"438\n\nTr. J. Merits, 29 October 2013, Day 2, p. 15, lines 23-25.\n\nLetter from Magnar to AVAS dated 27 March 2009 (C-19, p. 3).\n\n375.\n\nWhether formal or informal, the fact is that these documents were sent to AVAS three months after the deadline of 21 June 2008 for the 4th Year Investment obligation and were not the certification required by Article 14.3 of the Privatization Contract. Nothing would have prevented Magnar to transmit to AVAS the kind of document provided by the contract had it regularly fulfilled the 4th Year Investment obligation. AVAS was therefore right in recording in the Internal Note of 6 February 2009 that no papers had been received regarding the 4th Investment Year.439\n\nAVAS Internal Note dated 6 February 2009 (C- 53), p. 52.\n\n376.\n\nIn the absence of any documents showing fulfilment of the investment obligation for the 4th Year, starting from 28 November 2008, AVAS\u2019 control team performed an inspection at Rodipet\u2019s offices. No documents were provided by Florin Lungaci during this control showing compliance of the 4th Year obligations and no documents were provided thereafter, despite Florin Lungaci\u2019s promise to present them by 5 December 2008.440\n\nAVAS Control Note on performing verifications at Rodipet\u2019s office dated 15 December 2008 (R-225).\n\n377.\n\nAt that point in time the problem for AVAS was no longer one of delay but rather of failure to comply with the investment obligation regarding the 4th Year under Article 14.1 of the Privatization Contract. In a meeting of 17 March 2009, AVAS\u2019 Board of Directors decided to call the Pledge based on a note of 6 February 2009 by the Post-Privatization Monitoring and Legal Department of AVAS,441 due to the lack of any proof of compliance with the Privatization Contract until that time. Florin Lungaci personally and Magnar had in the meantime been sanctioned to pay a fine for failure to fulfil the contractual provisions.\n\nAVAS Internal Note dated 6 February 2009 (C-53).\n\n378.\n\nThe decision to call the Pledge for failure to fulfil the investment commitment \"due on 10.05.2008\", *i.e.* for the 4th Year, was notified to Magnar on 24 March 2OO9.442 Magnar protested by two letters on 27 March 2009. One of such letters was accompanied by a certificate from Magnar\u2019s auditors certifying compliance with the investment obligation for the 4th Year.443 Since during the December 2008 inspection at Rodipet\u2019s office, no underlying accounting and banking documents had been provided despite the control\u2019s team request, the certificate was considered not credible by AVAS.\n\nLetter from AVAS to Magnar dated 24 March 2009 (C-18, p. 2).\n\nOne letter was addressed to AVAS\u2019 Vice-President (C-19) and the other to AVAS\u2019 Chairman (C-67, without enclosures; R-223, with enclosed certification for the 4th year by Contexpert Grup 4 SRL). The certificate issued by the external auditor Contexpert Grup 4 SRL regarding the 4th year investments obligation, indicated by Responded as attached to one of the 27 March 2009 letters and identified as Exhibit C-216 (Resp. C-Mem, \u00b6 279 and n.505), does not mention that the 4th year obligation had already been fulfilled in 2006 (Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 279). However, this statement by Respondent has not been denied by Claimants. According to Respondent, the belated \"certificates\" produced by Magnar for the fourth investment year masked an accounting trick, no genuine investment having been made (Resp. Answers, \u00b6 22).\n\n379.\n\nRespondent had good reason to doubt the evidence of compliance of the 4th and 5th Year Investment obligations by the two certificates sent by Magnar on 24 April 2009, one dated 9 January 2OO9444 and the other 2 February 2OO9.445 As noted by AVAS\u2019s Legal Department in an internal memo dated 7 May 2009, no evidence had been given that their signatory had been appointed and registered as auditor of Rodipet, as required by Article 14.3 of the Privatization Contract. Further, the internal memo noted the reference in the certificates to the fact that investments for the 4th and 5th Years would have been made already in 2006. AVAS had a \"suspicion regarding the performance of the investments made\" in the absence \"of financial accounting documents attesting, with no doubt, the reality of performing the investments.\"446\n\nCertificate dated 9 January 2009 (C-68).\n\nCertificate dated 2 February 2009 (C-69).\n\nNote of the AVAS\u2019 General Legal Department dated 7 May 2009 (C-234, pp. 1-2).\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal finds AVAS\u2019 objections to the documents in question justified. Firstly, as shown by their dates, they were available since January-February 2009, more than one month before the decision by AVAS\u2019 Board to enforce the Pledge and over two months before Magnar transmitted them to AVAS. Why they were provided only on 24 April 2009 remains unexplained in view of AVAS\u2019 several warnings and requests for their production. Secondly, they were not certified by the duly appointed and registered auditor of Rodipet, a contractual requirement, not a formalistic one. Finally, if, as stated in those certificates, already in 2006 Magnar had fulfilled the 4th and 5th Year Investment obligations, why were they not provided by the deadline of 21 June 2008 (for the 4th Year) or following AVAS\u2019 requests and the onsite inspection of Rodipet during December 2008?\n\n381.\n\nContrary to Claimants\u2019 view,447 there is no requirement under the Privatization Contract to impose penalties as a condition to enforce the Pledge on the shares nor have Claimants pointed to any provisions of said Contract imposing such condition. In fact, the warnings given by Respondent and their duration were such that Respondent could have issued penalties before exercising the Pledge. The fact of having warned Claimants and waited without issuing any penalty before exercising the Pledge should not be held against Respondent. According to Article 15.4, \"[if] the Buyer does not comply with its obligations under 14.1, in any stage of the investments, according to Appendix No. 6, the Seller shall be entitled to entirely execute the pledge on the shares....\"\n\nCl. Answers, \u00b6 64.\n\n382.\n\nClaimants have contended that AVAS\u2019 actions in enforcing the Pledge \"were not proportional to the minor infractions alleged.\"448 Respondent has noted in reply that the enforcement of the Pledge had not regard to the entire shareholding owned by Claimants in Rodipet but only to 51% of the share capital of Rodipet.449 The Tribunal remarks that proportionality must be considered not merely from an economic point of view but in light of all the circumstances of the case. As described above, contrary to Claimants\u2019 behaviour for the first three years of investment obligations, their overall conduct regarding the manner by which they refused initially and then awkwardly attempted to prove fulfilment of investment obligations for years 4 and 5 did not consist in \"minor infractions.\" The serious uncertainties surrounding Magnar\u2019s fulfilment of such obligations justified AVAS\u2019 decision.\n\nCl.

Summary of the Parties\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n384.\n\nClaimants contend that in 1950, Respondent committed an injustice by depriving one of its citizens of Casa Bucur and in 2005 committed another injustice by taking Casa Bucur from Claimants without paying compensation.450 Claimants had invested heavily in Casa Bucur which they had purchased in 2002 through the vehicle of Alfa El Bucur, transforming it into a luxury boutique hotel and restaurant, extremely successful with the cost of works amounting, according to Gervase MacGregor, Claimants\u2019 expert, to RON 8,830,544.451\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 514.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 673.\n\n385.\n\nRestitution of properties nationalized under communist governments is an extremely sore and emotional subject in Romania and a major political issue.452 Claimants add that the laws in the field of restitution and the associated jurisprudence lack in consistency and make often the matter a major political issue in Romania.453 One of the Heirs, Luciana Mott, was a member of an organization *\"representing the interests of Romanian abusively dispossessed* *owners,\"* which mutated into a political lobby pressuring the Romanian State to favour former owners.454\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6 519 (italics in the text).\n\n386.\n\nRespondent had nationalized Casa Bucur in 1950 according to Decree 92/1950 providing for the nationalisation of assets belonging to \"class enemies,\" namely former industrialists and landowners or house exploiters. Some individuals were exempted, such as \"intellectuals,\" the Heirs alleging the misapplication of the Decree since their father was an \"intellectual.\"455\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 539-540.\n\n387.\n\nFollowing the re-privatization of State assets by Law 15/1990 and the possibility of selling or leasing these assets under GEO 88/1997, several sales contracts were entered into regarding Casa Bucur, including an irrevocable lease agreement between Alunis and Casa Bucur SRL on 31 March 1999 followed by three sales agreements, two between the same parties in August 1999 and October 2001 for the sale, respectively, of the Summer Kitchen and the Restaurant Building, and one on 21 February 2002 between Casa Bucur SRL and Alfa El Bucur for the sale of the entire Casa Bucur.\n\n388.\n\nThese contracts were concluded in good faith based on Respondent\u2019s review of the Heirs\u2019 claims, the Romanian courts having rejected their appeal against validation of the land title. Given the unstable legal framework created by restitution claims and special restitution legislation, warranties were given by Respondent to the buyers of commercial companies in case of restitution to former owners.456\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 543.\n\n389.\n\nThe transformation of the Casa Bucur Estate from a former socialist organization, IAPL Alunis, an entity controlled by the Bucharest Municipality of the Ministry of Domestic Commerce, into the property of a new commercial company, Alunis S.A., was based on Article 20 of Law 15/1990. The State organ created to manage the privatization process, which later became AVAS, stated on various occasions, including the privatization offer to Claimants answered via Mona Lisa Trading, that ownership of Casa Bucur had been transferred to Alunis S.A.457\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 551-554.\n\n390.\n\nBased on the provision of GEO 88/1997, Alunis and Restaurant Bucur SRL, to which a lease had been granted until 1999, sought on 31 March 1999 to transform the lease into a real estate leasing agreement with an irrevocable sale option.458 Before such transformation, the Heirs had filed a law suit against the Bucharest Municipality, seeking the restitution of the Casa Bucur Estate and had summoned the majority shareholder of Alunis S.A., F.P.S., to stop the privatization of Alunis or the transfer of the Estate.459\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 556-558.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 559.\n\n391.\n\nDespite that, F.P.S. decided to continue the privatization process, explaining to the Parliament that the transformation into a real estate leasing agreement, the leasing contract with Casa Bucur SRL, and the sale of the shares held by it at Alunis S.A. complied with the legal provisions in force.460 Accordingly, its stock of shares in Alunis (87%) was put up for public tender by F.P.S. in early 2000. The Heirs addressed an \"opposition\" to the auction of F.P.S shares in Alunis on 28 March 2000. Despite that, the auction took place on April 2000 and the tender was won by Mona Lisa Trading Co. SRL. The bidders were simply informed that \"there is a litigation for the revendication of the estate BUCUR RESTAURANT between SC ALUNIS and Mrs IOANA MOTT.\"461\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 560.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 562.\n\n392.\n\nBy Law 99/1999, foreign investors were guaranteed compensation should a property be returned to former owners as a result of a successful restitution claim in Romanian courts, for an amount equal to the prejudice caused by the in-kind restitution. Claimants relied on such guarantee when deciding to buy the shares of Alunis S.A.462\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 566-568.\n\n393.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the Romanian Supreme Court ruled that the Casa Bucur Estate should be returned to the Heirs. The Decision came as a surprise to Claimants since until then both the Romanian Government and the courts had systematically rejected the Heirs\u2019 claims, holding that the 1950 nationalization under Decree 92/1950 was rightful. The Decision amounted to expropriation in breach of the BIT, considering also that Claimants\u2019 compensation requests had been rejected by Respondent.463 The Decision breached also fair and equitable treatment, amounting to a denial of justice, and Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations because they had invested in Casa Bucur Estate in reliance on Respondent\u2019s representations.464\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 588-592.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 600.\n\n394.\n\nThe Decision amounted to denial of justice because it was in violation of international minimum standard, which includes the proper administration of justice, a \"manifestly erroneous decision.\"465 The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision committed manifest, obvious, and inexcusable misapplications of Romanian law by performing a retroactive constitutional review of Decree 92/1950 which was not allowed under the 1948 Constitution, to then hold that the Decree was inapplicable to the Heirs\u2019 father.466 Contrary to Respondent\u2019s view, misapplication of a domestic law that is grossly and inexcusably mistaken amounts to denial of justice. The Supreme Court misinterpreted and misapplied Decree 92/1950.467\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 690-697.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 601-619; Cl.

Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 739-740.\n\n395.\n\nThe breach of the principle of non-retroactivity affecting the foreign investors\u2019 rights amounts to a breach of fair and equitable treatment, as held by ICSID tribunals. No power could be granted by a subsequent law, Law 213/1998, for a constitutional review of Decree 92/1950 that was not permitted by the 1948 Constitution.468 Claimants mention that the Supreme Court apparently endorsed the Heirs\u2019 argument that Decree 92/1950 was unconstitutional because it breached the 1948 Constitution and the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 but, if so, the interpretation of the 1948 Constitution was an anachronism while the U.N. Declaration is neither binding nor does it codify any existing rule of international law.469\n\nCl.Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 620-625; Cl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 705-709.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 629-637; Cl.

Rep., \u00b6 723.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 724.\n\n397.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s misinterpretation of Decree 92/1950 is manifestly wrong and proves that it was biased when holding that the nationalization did not comply with Article 1 and 2 of the Decree since the claimed property was not acquired for obtaining revenues not being a production means, and the Heirs\u2019 father was not a property developer or a landlord being rather a \"professional intellectual,\" as it results from his work book, the number of apartments owned by him being not referred to by the law.472 The evidence produced by the Heirs, that the Supreme Court did not bother to review, showed on the contrary that their father collected rent from leasing his properties between 1941 and 1945 and did not live only from his professional income.473 To be exempted from the application of Decree 92/1950 the professional intellectual must show to have acquired the property through work or labour. This was made explicit by Decree 524/1955.474 The refusal to obey the law shows the Supreme Court\u2019s arbitrariness and total disregard of the rule of law, a denial of justice under international law.475\n\nResp.

Rep., \u00b6 742, 751-755.\n\n398.\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court simply disregarded Article 20 of Law 15/1990 when reasoning that Alunis should have proven an ownership title over Casa Bucur prior to such law. This contradicts other decisions of the Supreme Court. In addition, the Supreme Court acted in an outrageous manner when assessing the probative value of the evidence proffered by the parties by disregarding numerous documents proving transfer of ownership in 1969 to IAPL Central and relying on reports produced by the Heirs without offering the defendants the opportunity to produce counter-expertise.476\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 652-659.\n\n399.\n\nFurther, copying word by word the Heirs\u2019 submission the Court held that the real estate agreement was *\"absolutely null and void'* finding, contrary to the facts, that it had not been authorised by the F.P.S. and that it did not fulfil the condition of the buyer investing 10% of the value of the estate based on an \"extrajudicial report\" commissioned by the Heirs to support their criminal complaints against Alunis\u2019 officers in 2002.477\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 660-668 (italics in the text).\n\n400.\n\nContrary to lower courts\u2019 findings that, based on the evidence, Casa Bucur entered the patrimony of Alunis, the Supreme Court refuted such factual findings and, based on expert reports, adopted the Heirs\u2019 position refuting the effects of Law 15/1990 as neither the land nor the building had been registered in the patrimony of Alunis.478\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 757-773.\n\n401.\n\nThe fact that Alunis and Casa Bucur SRL knew that there was an Heirs\u2019 claim was not enough to prove that they orchestrated a plan to overcome a mandatory prohibition to sell the Casa Bucur Estate. To deduce a fraudulent intention and to defeat the presumption of good faith, the Heirs had the burden to prove that Alunis and Casa Bucur SRL knew that they were the rightful owners and that the real estate leasing agreement was concluded to avoid restituting the Casa Bucur Estate.479 There was no legal obligation at the time the sale contract was concluded to refrain from transferring property subject to a Law 10/2001 restitution claim, such prohibition having been made only in September 2005 by Law No. 247/2005.480\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 669-690.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 685-686.\n\n402.\n\nRegarding the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning concerning historical monuments, its bias in the Heirs\u2019 favour is manifest when considering that if, as it held, the Restaurant never ceased to be an historical monument it could not have ordered Alfa El Bucur to leave it to the Heirs in full property and possession since according to Law 63/1974 historical monuments belong to the State. Both Casa Bucur SRL and Alfa El Bucur in parallel proceedings emphasized that they were neither notified about the classification of the Estate as a historical monument nor were they aware of such status, the latter being disputed at the time.481\n\nCl.

Concerning the contract between Alunis and Casa Bucur SRL, the status of historical monument of Casa Bucur had been contested when the Supreme Court made its decision, the historical status being published only in 2004.482 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision was even for Respondent\u2019s expert incomprehensible by its application of Article 10 of Law 112/1995 since the prohibition to sell had been lifted by GEO 228/2000.483 Concerning the other contracts, where the key issue was whether the status of historical monument was still valid, the Supreme Court, without giving any reason, stated that *\"the fact that the change of its destination took place in legal conditions\"* was irrelevant for establishing whether the State\u2019s pre-emption right had been respected.484\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 709-724.\n\n405.\n\nClaimants decided to buy and invest in the Casa Bucur Estate based on the apparent ownership as a recognised general principle requiring that the purchaser was in good faith considering also that when Claimants invested in Casa Bucur the former owner was barred from claiming restitution under Decree 218/1960.\n\n406.\n\nAt the time of their acquisition of Casa Bucur, Claimants knew that there were ongoing claims by the Heirs but this does not mean that decades of legislation and assurances and not less than 11 Romanian court decisions could alter the honest belief that the acquisition was valid.486 Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations when they invested in Casa Bucur were protected by the doctrine of apparent ownership which was disregarded by the Supreme Court Decision in breach of the Treaty.487 The subsequent decision of 6 March 2006 rejecting the request to review the judgment was in breach of Article II(6) of the BIT for failure to accord an effective remedy.488\n\nCl.

F.P.S. was obliged to compensate Alunis for the prejudice caused by the restitution, an obligation guaranteed by the State under Law 99/1999.489 The right to compensation of companies \"privatised or under privatisation\" passed to Alfa El Bucur when it purchased the Casa Bucur Estate, as successor of Alunis.490\n\nCl.

The purpose of the law was to accelerate the privatization process by attracting foreign investment to promote the privatisation of commercial companies. The international obligation to which Law 99/1999 has given rise is protected by Article II 2(c) of the BIT.492\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 387-388.\n\nCl.

Having had no success, it requested compensation directly from Respondent pursuant to the guarantee under Law 99/1999. However, Respondent\u2019s courts annulled the proceeding for failure to pay court fees of around USD 111,190 in one case and USD 145,000 in another, despite exemption of court fees provided by Law 10/2001.493\n\nCl.

Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n411.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s view that at the heart of Claimants\u2019 claims regarding Casa Soare is the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of November 2005 that they never held ownership rights over Casa Soare and their ensuing failure to obtain relief in relation to such decision.496\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 316.\n\n412.\n\nRespondent describes initially the background of the complex problems of property restitution in Romania and the legal uncertainties created by an ever-evolving national and international framework regarding restitution of nationalized property in Romania, underlying the widespread legal risk of foreign investors as to property ownership.497 An important driving force in the relevant legal regime was Romania\u2019s 1994 ratification of the ECHR bringing under international scrutiny Romania\u2019s legislative and judicial response to the property restitution problem. Law 213/1998 was passed clarifying that courts had jurisdiction to hear claims for restitution of property nationalized by the State and to determine whether the State had acquired title in accordance with the then in force Constitution.498\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 318-330.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 281-282.\n\n413.\n\nRespondent then analyses the long history of the attempted transfer of ownership of Casa Soare while court litigation was pending upon initiative first of Dimitru Soare and then of his Heirs (\"the Soares\") to establish ownership of the same property.499 It is during the pendency of this litigation that the company Street Comer, which managed Casa Soare under a lease agreement of December 1990 with Alunis, became part of the Awdi Group in February 2002. Also, Alunis became later part of the same group.500\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 336-341.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 338.\n\n414.\n\nRespondent further emphasises the additional difficulty posed to the restitution problem regarding Casa Soare by legislation protecting national monuments. Casa Soare was publicly known to be a national monument, a fact that could hardly pass unnoticed and that determined the applicable legal regime in Romania. According to Law 442/2001 on the protection of historical monuments, any sale of Casa Soare as a historical monument occurring after the coming into force of Law 442/2001 in July 2001 would have been subject to the Ministry of Culture\u2019s pre-emptive rights under sanction of nullity of the sale. This provision would have applied to the purported acquisition of Casa Soare in October 2001.\n\n415.\n\nAccording to Respondent, despite pending legislation concerning ownership of Casa Soare, Alunis and Street Comer took the risk of signing an agreement on 31 March 1999 for the sale of the property over Casa Soare for ROL 2.4 billion (EUR 144,184 or USD 154,839), fully aware of the reasonable likelihood that the Romanian courts would confirm the Soare\u2019s ownership of Casa Bucur. An annex to the agreement warned Street Corner of this risk.501 The sale referred to in the March 1999 agreement was effected in October 2001.502\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 343; Resp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 344.\n\n416.\n\nBefore the attempted sale was completed, Mona Lisa acquired 87% of the share capital of Alunis, for half the price at which they had been offered at the auction, presumably for the legal risk regarding the restitution of Casa Soare.503 The tender documents were clear in indicating that \"Alunis does not have lands\" while regarding the buildings owned by Alunis there is no mention of Casa Soare in the list of properties, the bidders being referred to the status of Casa Soare, as being subject to \"a litigation for revendication\" between Alunis and the Soares.504 This explains, in Respondent\u2019s view, why the price paid for Alunis\u2019 shares was only USD 155,907 (ROL 2,924,050,000) despite Alunis owning other valuable assets.505\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 347-350.\n\n417.\n\nAfter Mona Lisa\u2019s acquisition of 87% of Alunis, steps were taken by the Awdi Group to strengthen their position by\n\n- purporting to acquire Casa Soare via the irrevocable sale clause between Street Comer and Alunis on 3 October 2001, for USD 138,694 (ROL 4,251,104,794 and EUR 147,532);\n\n- incorporating a new company, Alfa El Romania, on 29 October 2001;\n\n- causing EBC to acquire Street Corner on 17 October 2001; and\n\n- purporting to transfer Casa Soare from Street Comer to Alfa El Romania on 21 February 2002 for USD 500,000 (ROL 16,150,000,000 or EUR 554,800), payment of which is unproven. In all such transactions not only no proof of valid ownership over Casa Soare was provided,506 but Street Comer expressly declared in the context of the agreement of October 2001 that it was aware of the legal and *de facto* situation of the property and accepted the risk.507\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 352-354.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 303.\n\n418.\n\nContrary to Claimants\u2019 mention that since 1992 courts had dismissed the Soare\u2019s claims 11 times, all decisions of lower and higher courts had been quashed in appeal. Shortly before the first attempts to transfer ownership over Casa Soare in October 2001 - February 2002, two separate appeals by the Soares had been successful on 19 April 2001, the Supreme Court taking issue with lower courts\u2019 failure to properly administer evidence. These facts were known to everyone asserting rights regarding Casa Soare.508\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 293-294, 356-359.\n\n419.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants make a plethora of serious allegations against the November 2005 Decision of the Supreme Court, which even if right under Romanian law, which they are not, cannot prompt the Tribunal to revise the substantive findings of Romanian courts, as shown by the key legal conclusions of the Supreme Court regarding ownership of Casa Soare.\n\n420.\n\nThe thrust of the retrial of the Soares\u2019 claims as from 2001 concerned the illegality of the 1950 nationalization under the law applicable at the time. Already the Bucharest Court of Appeal had confirmed on 26 June 2003 that the taking of the property based on Decree 92/1950 contravened the 1948 Constitution and was in violation of the international regulations guaranteeing ownership rights, ordering compensation to the Soares for the 1950 taking but erring, according to the Supreme Court, since restitution should instead have been ordered.509\n\nResp. C-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6 364-367; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 307.\n\n421.\n\nThe November 2005 Decision found that the 1950 nationalisation did not result in a valid title, holding that the State never lawfully owned Casa Soare, thus confirming the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding that the taking was unlawful.\n\n422.\n\nAdditional reasons were given by the Supreme Court for the November 2005 decision. Firstly, there was no evidence that Casa Soare had been transferred to Alunis when the latter was transformed into a private company, Casa Soare having been never listed among Alunis\u2019 assets. Secondly, the sale contract between Alunis and Street Comer, and the contracts between the latter and Alfa El Romania were void for failure to respect the mandatory pre-emption right of the Ministry of Culture.510 Further, the Supreme Court ruled that Decree 92/1950 was inapplicable to the owner of Casa Soare, Dimitru Soare, because he was a \"professional intellectual\" within the meaning of the exception of Article 2.511\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 318-324.\n\n423.\n\nTwo remedies were available to Alfa El Romania against the November 2005 decision: a request of revision, which did not succeed for failure to state reasons, and an appeal for annulment, which was filed on 2 November 2006 but rejected since the material mistakes that were alleged do not warrant annulment. Claimants have not attempted to seek compensation for the harm allegedly suffered according to Article 52(3) of the Romanian Constitution providing for patrimonial liability of the State for prejudice caused by judicial errors. This provision does not remove liability from judges and prosecutors for having exercised their office in bad faith or with serious negligence.512\n\nResp. C-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6 378-380.\n\n424.\n\nClaimants\u2019 requests to the Soares for unjust enrichment under Law 10/2001 and civil law were rejected, the first since this cause of action is available only to tenants affected by restitution and the second for refusal to pay court fees. Claimants\u2019 claim of compensation against the State failed because no right of compensation is available under Law 99/1999 or GEO 88/1997, as amended, both relied upon by Claimants, to investors acquiring shares in privatised companies or to companies acquiring properties from such companies, such as Claimants, Mona Lisa, Street Comer, or Alfa El Romania, as consistently held in Romania case law.513\n\nResp. C-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6384-387.\n\n425.\n\nThe only one entitled to request compensation from the Soares could have been Alunis but the latter never requested compensation nor did Street Comer and Alfa El Romania seek damages from Alunis.514 Claims filed sequentially by Alfa El Romania against AVAS, the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs and the Ministry of Finance under Law 99/1999 were dismissed for failure to pay court fees.515 Claimants\u2019 argument that Law 10/2001 providing for exemption from court fees was discriminatory as it favoured Romanian nationals over foreign investors,516 fails to consider that Alfa El Romania, the party filing the claim, is a Romanian national.517 In sum, Claimants cannot allege that Respondent denied them effective remedies under Romanian law.518\n\nResp.

C-Mem, \u00b6 392.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that at the heart of Claimants\u2019 claims regarding Casa Bucur is the Decision of the Romanian Supreme Court of 15 November 2005 ruling that Claimants never held ownership rights over that estate. According to Claimants, the taking of the Casa Bucur property on 20 March 2008 as a result of the Decision is \"a text book example of an expropriation\" in breach of the BIT, considering that all compensation requests had been rejected by Respondent.519 In addition, the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision breached the fair and equitable treatment standard guarantees by the BIT since it amounted to a flagrant denial of justice by systematically departing from principles of justice recognised by international minimum standards by \"manifest, obvious and inexcusable misapplication of Romanian law.\"520 The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision breached at the same time Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations to have legally invested in Casa Bucur based on representations made by Respondent.521\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 590.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 603-604.\n\nCL. Mem., \u00b6 600.\n\n427.\n\nRespondent concedes that the legal regime was complex, that it underwent multiple changes and inconsistent court decisions throughout the years, more recently under pressure for a change induced by Romania\u2019s accession, in June 1994, to the ECHR to ensure that its legal system would allow adequate protection to victims of property nationalisation.522 This brought about a change in the legal regime. While under the previous regulation tenants were allowed to purchase the buildings they lived in and rightful owners were entitled to compensation,523 Law 10/2001 provided as a rule for restitution in kind of land properties with or without construction.524 Respondent notes that \"this state of constant change prevailed in Romania long before Claimants\u2019 attempted acquisition of rights over Casa Soare.\"525 The Tribunal considers this point central to the proper adjudication of Claimants\u2019 claims and shall address it to the necessary extent.\n\nThe ECtHR judgment of 28 October 1999 *vaBrumarescu* v. *Romania* held Romania liable for breach of Article 6 (1) of the ECHR insofar as it deprived owners of unlawfully confiscated property of final judicial relief.\n\nBaias\u2019 Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 51-55; Mihai\u2019s Opinion, \u00b6 623.\n\nMihai\u2019s Opinion, \u00b6 725.\n\nResp. C-Mem, \u00b6 325. Respondent constantly refers to Casa Soare as the property was initially denominated.\n\n428.\n\nIn a country profile regarding Romania, a 2001 United Nations report summarises the situation as follows:\n\n*A major problem, however, is to identify the landowner - or, more precisely, to identify him with*  ***any degree of certainty: about 70% of all titles issued since 1990 are being contested in court.***  *Titles issued up to 1999 do not contain information on precise location and tax payments.*  \n*Cadastre registering is incomplete, since there is no legal obligation to register land transfers and 50 years ago private land was transferred to the public domain and most of the registers lost. Therefore*  ***new claims to a piece of land cannot be ruled out, and buying land involves risks.***\n\n429.\n\nThe status of Casa Bucur as an historical monument was an additional problem. This status had been publicly known for a long time due to its inclusion in the List of historical monuments starting from 1955, confirmed in 1992 and 2000.526 By the time of Claimants\u2019 acquisition of Casa Bucur in October 2001, a law in force since 2001, Law 442/2001, provided for the right of pre-emption of the Romanian State in case of sale of historical monuments in the propriety of individuals or legal persons of private law, under sanction of absolute nullity of the sale.527 Claimants\u2019 allegation of being unware of the status of Casa Bucur528 does not withstand the presumption of knowledge of such status through public records.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 331.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 332.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 701.\n\n430.\n\nAs mentioned by Respondent and not disputed by Claimants,529 since October 1991, Dimitru Soare, who had inherited Casa Bucur from his father, asserted ownership over the same. Following his death, his two children (the \"Soares\" or the \"Heirs\") continued to assert and judicially pursue recognition of ownership over Casa Bucur for the following 14 years until the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision of November 2005 established their right of ownership.530\n\nClaimants admit to have been \"aware of the Heirs\u2019 restitution claim\" when Alfa El Bucur agreed on 21 February 2002 to conclude the sale contract with Casa Bucur SRL \"on its own risk\" (Cl. Mem., \u00b6 691).\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 336-341.\n\n431.\n\nRespondent adds that the publicity of all relevant legislation and case law, including case law of the ECtHR, regarding the property restitution problem and the wide national debate on the subject could not have escaped the attention of an investor in real estate.531\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 330.\n\n432.\n\nWhen Street Comer executed a lease with Alunis in March 1999 with an irrevocable sale clause for Casa Bucur, it signed a declaration that it concluded the agreement \"knowing that it is subject to dispute and accepting the risks deriving therefrom.\"532 Having later acquired both Alunis and Street Comer, the Awdi Group became aware of the risk inherent to the transfer of property of Casa Bucur.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 297.\n\n433.\n\nWhen Mona Lisa acquired at the auction 87% stoke of Alunis, it was specifically warned of the risk associated with Casa Bucur, in addition to the fact that in the list of Alunis\u2019 properties Casa Bucur was classified as \"an immovable good claimed by others,\" the risk being reflected by the lower price paid with respect to the price Alunis had previously agreed to sell Casa Bucur to Street Corner.533\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 347-349; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 299-300.\n\n434.\n\nWhen Alunis (then controlled by the Awdi Group) and Street Corner (also controlled by the Awdi Group) concluded the Sale and Purchase Agreement in October 2001, the new regime favouring restitution in kind by Law 10/2001 was in force. Street Corner expressly declared that it was \"aware of the legal and de facto situation of the real estate property as being the one shown by the seller, at its own risk,\" and both parties received \"the 4th district court of law and... the Notary Public of the investigation of the transcription and inscription registries.\"534\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 303 with reference to the text of the two Sales and Purchase Agreements, one of the Restaurant dated 5 October 2001 (C-252) and the other for Casa Soare Estate dated 21 February 2002 (C-249).\n\n435.\n\nAs early as June 2001, the Land Book recorded that the title to the property was disputed. As mentioned by Respondent this was before Street Comer acquired Casa Soare from Alunis on 5 October 2001, EBC acquired Street Comer on 17 October 2001 and Alfa El Romania acquired Casa Soare from Street Comer on 5 February 2002.535 It is clear to the Tribunal that given the relatively low price to be paid with respect to the value of Casa Bucur, the Awdi Group felt worthwhile running the risk of losing the property. This risk materialised with the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision of November 2005.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 305 and nn.607.\n\n436.\n\nIt is not the Tribunal\u2019s task to review the content of the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision, except to the extent it may be clearly established that, as contended by Claimants, it violated international minimum standard in so many respects as to result in a denial of justice, in breach of the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed to the investor under Article Il(2)(a) of the BIT. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Parties\u2019 arguments and the legal opinions filed in support of their respective positions. It has concluded that no charge of denial of justice may be raised against the November 2005 Decision of the Supreme Court, the latter having made application of the legal regime then in force favouring restitution in kind to rightful owners.\n\n437.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that the ownership of Casa Bucur had been disputed since October 1991, when Dimitru Soare first raised claims in that regard. This explains why Street Comer, Alunis, Mona Lisa, and Alfa El Romania had all signed declarations accepting the ensuing risk when concluding the various transactions related to Casa Bucur. It should have come therefore as no surprise to the Awdi Group to leam from the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision that the State, and accordingly Alunis, had never been the lawful owner of Casa Bucur, the true owner being the Heirs.\n\n438.\n\nThe status of Casa Bucur as a historical monument was known through the public records and should not have escaped the Awdi Group\u2019s attention as a careful investor, together with the related mandatory pre-emptive right of the Ministry of Culture in case of transfer of its ownership. In view of the legal sanction of the nullity of any transfer of ownership of Casa Bucur in breach of the pre-emptive right in question, it should likewise have come as no surprise to the Awdi Group to learn from the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision that the sale of Casa Bucur between Alunis and Street Corner in October 2001 was void for failure to respect the State\u2019s mandatory pre-emptive right.\n\n439.\n\nWhen the Awdi Group acquired both Alunis and Street Comer and the latter triggered the irrevocable sales clause in the lease agreement with Alunis, thereby acquiring Casa Soare,536 they had knowledge of the legal risk of restitution. That the risk accepted by Claimants had regard to the restitution of the property to the Heirs is recognised by Respondent.537 The risk clearly did not concern the payment of the price by Street Corner for acquiring Casa Soare from Alunis based on the lease contract dated 31 March 1999 when Alunis was still the State\u2019s property.538\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 432.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 306: \"The risk posed by the Soare\u2019s claim for **restitution** ultimately materialized in the Supreme Court\u2019s November 2005 Decision\" (emphasis added). *See also,* \u00b6 298: \"The Awdi group later acquired both Alunis and Street Comer and therefore must have been aware that Street Comer liad assumed the risk of **restitution** of Casa Soare to its former owners...\" (emphasis added).\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b63OO.\n\n440.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimants had a legitimate expectation that had the risk in question materialised, they should be returned the price agreed for the purchase of Casa Soare. Fair and equitable treatment guaranteed by the BIT to Claimants\u2019 investment in Casa Soare demands that the amount of the price paid, equal to EUR 147,532,539 be reimbursed to them.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 352(a).\n\n441.\n\nExcept for the reimbursement of the price paid for acquiring Casa Soare, as provided above, no further compensation is due to Claimants under this head of claim.\n\n442.\n\nIn particular, no compensation is due for works done on the property. Aware of the risk of restitution and the impending decision of the Supreme Court in that regard, Claimants should have refrained from investing in Casa Bucur for its renovation.540\n\n*Infra,* \u00b6 517.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n**A. Summary of the Parties\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n443.\n\nClaimants submitted two different expert reports in support of their claims. The first was prepared by Andrew Flower and Greig Taylor of FTI (the \"FTI report\") and submitted with the Memorial. The FTI report makes calculations for Claimants\u2019 principal claim (Rodipet, Rodipet Courier, Supremo Media, and Balbec), alternative claim (the concession and the amounts invested), additional claim (properties lost), and Casa Bucur. The second expert report was prepared by Gervase MacGregor of BDO LLP (the \"MacGregor report\") and submitted with the Counter-Memorial. The MacGregor report makes calculations for Claimants\u2019 principal claim (Rodipet and Rodipet Courier together, Supremo Media, and Balbec), alternative claim (the concession and the amounts invested), and Casa Bucur only. In addition to the heads of claims found in these two expert reports, Claimants request moral damages and interest.\n\n444.\n\nClaimants submit two alternative dates, which are also reflected in the calculations made by both expert reports. The first date is 6 September 2008, when the Concession was declared unconstitutional by the revocation of Law 442, and the second date is 30 June 2009, when AVAS enforced the Pledge it held over 51% of the shares of Rodipet.541\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 575, 577.\n\n445.\n\nFor the heads of claims for which both expert reports make calculations, they reach different results for reasons explained in the MacGregor report.542 The table below provides a summary.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | **6 September 2008** | **30 June 2009** |\n|  | **Heads of claims** | **FTI report** | **MacGregor** **report** | **FTI report** | **MacGregor** **report** |\n| **Principal claim** | Rodipet | 223 | 105,597 | 216,272 | 97,021 |\n| Rodipet Courier | 3 | Included in Rodipet | 3 | Included in Rodipet |\n| Supremo Media | 77 | 56,318 | 77 | 49,622 |\n| Balbec | 1.6-4.7 | 1,484 | 1.6-4.7 | 1,604 |\n| **Alternative** **claim** | Concession | 79-80 | 16,029,814 | 79-80 | 13,531,258 |\n| Invested amounts | 21.9 | 4.9 | 21.9 | 4.9 |\n| **Additional** **claim** | Properties | 23.9 | - | 23.9 | - |\n| Moral damages | *5% of awarded damages, no less than EUR 10 million* |  | *5% of awarded damages, no less than EUR 10 million* |  |\n| **Casa Bucur** | Casa Bucur (March 2008) | 3.5 | 11,044 | 3.5 | 11,044 |\n|  | Interest- compounded yearly | 12%-l3%, alternatively 3-mo Euribor + 4.25% |\n| *Note: all amounts are in millions of euros.* |\n\nMacGregor report, \u00b6\u00b6 2.4-2.5.\n\n*a. Principal claim*\n--------------------\n\n(i) Rodipet and Rodipet Courier\n-------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent expropriated Rodipet on the day that the Concession was revoked on 6 September 2008. According to Claimants, \"this Concession was the oxygen of Rodipet and the Claimants based their entire business model on the idea that the company would benefit from a 49 year rent-free concession....\"543 Claimants also argue that if the Tribunal were to disagree that Rodipet was expropriated when the Concession was revoked, the enforcement of the Pledge over 51% of Rodipet shares on 30 June 2009 was a \"pure direct expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 investment in Rodipet.\"544\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 591.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 592.\n\n447.\n\nRegarding Rodipet Courier, Claimants submit that the company was responsible for the delivery of press and FMCGs to the kiosks and Balbec shops. Rodipet Courier relied on Rodipet for its cash flow and administration and on Supremo Media to rent a car fleet for the conduct of its operations. The expropriation of Rodipet and the slanderous media campaign organized against Claimants led to the downfall of Rodipet Courier.\n\n448.\n\nThe FTI report values Rodipet at **EUR 223 million** as of 6 September 2008 and at **EUR 216 million** as of 30 June 2009. It values Rodipet Courier separately at **EUR 3 million.545**\n\nFTI report, \u00b6\u00b6 2.3-2.4.\n\n449.\n\nThe MacGregor report values Rodipet and Rodipet Courier as a block because \"Rodipet Courier was merely a department of Rodipet turned into a company in charge of the distribution of the press and FMCG goods by means of a fleet it rented to [.sic] Supremo.\"546 Based on the MacGregor report, the value of Rodipet and Rodipet Courier is at **EUR 105,597,000** as of 6 September 2008 and at **EUR 97,021,000** as of 30 June 2OO9.547 These values are confirmed in Claimants\u2019 PHB.548\n\nCl.

The shops were built on the convenience store model. They were larger than kiosks and offered a wider range of goods and services. Rodipet was Balbec Retail\u2019s main supplier of press-related products and FMCGs. Balbec Retail also relied on Rodipet Courier to deliver its products.553\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 832-33.\n\n453.\n\nThe FTI report values Balbec between **EUR 1.6** and **4.7 million** as of 6 September 2008 and 30 June 2009. The MacGregor report values Balbec at **EUR 1,484,000** as of September 2008 and at **EUR 1,604,000** as of 30 June 2OO9.554 However, in their PHB, Claimants point out that there were errors in Gervase MacGregor\u2019s calculations, and the value of Balbec ought to have been **EUR 350,871** as of 6 September 2008 and **EUR 324,934** as of 30 June 20 09.555\n\nCl.

Rep., \u00b6 603.\n\n(i) The Concession\n------------------\n\n455.\n\nClaimants assert that \"the revocation of Law 442 on 6 September 2008 amounted in an expropriation of [their] Concession.\"557 The FTI report considered the Concession as rent-free and assigned to it a value between EUR 79 and 80 million.558 The MacGregor report calculated the FMV of the Concession as of 6 September 2008 at **EUR 84,188,274** as a rent-free and at **EUR 66,081,094** as not rent-free.559\n\nCl.

Additional claim*\n---------------------\n\n(i) Lost properties\n-------------------\n\n457.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Rodipet owned commercial properties as well as residential properties. The commercial properties were used in Rodipet\u2019s activities and taken into account in the DCF valuation of the company. The residential properties, which Claimants assert were lost \"as a direct result of Romania\u2019s expropriatory measures,\" were not taken into account in the DCF valuation.563 These properties, Claimants continue, must be compensated for under the principle of full compensation to wipe out all the consequences of the wrongful act.564\n\nCl.

Claimants argue that reparation must be \"full,\" under the Chorz\u00f3w Factory standard, and that the \"formulation of Article 31 [of the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles on State Responsibility] is clearly intended as inclusive, covering moral and material damage in broad terms.\"568 Claimants cite *Desert Lines* v. *Yemen569* for the proposition that the recovery of moral damages besides economic damages is generally accepted. They also cite *Benvenuti* v. *Congo570* and *Lemire* v. *Ukraine571* to argue that moral damages may be recovered for \"an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, loss of social position or injury to his credit or his reputation.\"572\n\nCl.

In this case, Claimants suffered moral damages in three ways: (1) Hasan Awdi, his family, and Claimants\u2019 executives suffered the stress and anxiety of being harassed, arrested, and held in Romania unlawfully, (2) Claimants suffered prolonged unlawful penal claims, and (3) Claimants suffered injury to their credit and reputation and lost their prestige.573\n\nCl.

Casa Bucur*\n---------------\n\n(i) Denial of effective remedies\n--------------------------------\n\n463.\n\nAs an alternative to their claims for denial of justice and breach of legitimate expectations, Claimants contend that they are entitled to be compensated for the entire value of the Casa Bucur estate under (1) International Law and (2) Romanian Law.\n\n464.\n\nAccording to Claimants, international tribunals have recognized that \"event if a *bona fides* buyer of an estate did not acquire ownership due to some particularities of the applicable domestic legislation, it shall be compensated for the price he paid and the improvements he made.\"575 Claimants cite various decisions issued by the European Court of Human Rights as examples in support of its position. For Claimants, the Romanian Supreme Court breached this standard in its November 2005 judgment by failing to decide Alunis and Alfa El Bucur\u2019s counter-claim for compensation in case of restitution.576\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 743.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 746.\n\n465.\n\nClaimants argue that they have a right to be compensated under Article 32^4 of Law 99/1999, which provides:\n\n(1) The public institutions involved ensure the compensation for the prejudices caused to the companies, privatized or under privatization, by the restitution to the former owners of the immovable assets taken over by the State.\n\n(2) The public institutions involved will pay to the companies mentioned under par. (1) a compensation representing the equivalent in money of the prejudice caused by the restitution in kind of the real estates owned by the company to the former owners by effect of a definitive and irrevocable Court decision.\n\n(3) The compensation under par. (2) shall be mutually agreed with the companies and, in case of divergence, shall be settled in Court.\n\n[...]\n\n(4) The State guarantees the completion by the public institutions involved of the compulsions stipulated by this article.\n\n466.\n\nClaimants argue that \"[i]n enacting Law 99/1999, the State actively represented to foreign investors that investments in Romania were safe; any risk was eliminated....\" The doctrine of legitimate expectations has developed various markers to guide tribunal, among them are two pre-requisites: the host state made certain representations, and the investor was reasonable to have relied on them. Claimants\u2019 expectation that they would receive compensation on the basis of this law was legitimate because (1) they had control over Alunis at the time of their investment, and (2) Law 99/1999 created a right which attached to the land and such right passed from Casa Bucur to Alfa El Bucur when it purchased the estate.\n\n467.\n\nDeveloping further the last two points, Claimants indicate that they sought compensation as \"successors of Alunis.\" According to Claimants, they ensured that they were in a position of control over Casa Bucur throughout the transactions surrounding the ownership of the estate. Mona Lisa, which had purchased Alunis, is owned by Claimants. EBC, which had acquired Casa Bucur SRL, is also owned by Claimants. Alfa El Bucur, which in the end directly acquired Casa Bucur, is also owned by Claimants.\n\n468.\n\nClaimants further argue that while under Law 99/1999 the newly privatised companies would have received any compensation, this law in fact created a right to compensation for the loss of real estate, which right is inextricably linked to the real estate itself and would pass with the real estate in case of transfer of ownership. Claimants contend that this legal doctrine is adopted by civil law countries, including Romania where it is found both in the 1864 Civil Code and the new 2011 Civil Code which provides \"the buyer acquires ownership of all rights and claims of accessories that belonged to the seller.\" Claimants also argue that \"accessories\" refer to tangible and intangible rights attached to the transferred object; \"[t]herefore, the right for compensation that was created by Law 99/1999, as well as the State guarantee securing such right, would have remained with the companies \"privatised or under privatisation\" for as long as they owned the relevant real estates, but would have passed with such real estates in the event that these companies sold them on to subsequent purchasers.\"\n\n469.\n\nClaimants pursued claims against the Soare family. After the Supreme Court\u2019s November 2005 decision was issued, Claimants filed three cases seeking retention of the estate until the payment of compensation. Claimants sought compensation on the basis of Law 10/2001 (which was used by the Supreme Court) for improvements made to the estate. As well, Claimants filed an unjust enrichment claim based on the Civil Code. Both claims were rejected by the Bucharest District Court which found that Alfa El Bucur lacked standing. On this basis, Claimants dropped their case under Law 10/2001 and pursued only the unjust enrichment claims. However, Claimants indicate that those claims were annulled based on findings that Claimants should have paid court fees and judicial stamps. Finally, Claimants attempted an action of retention right as well as an order of suspension of the eviction, to avoid being evicted from the estate until payment of compensation, but the courts refused to hear the case due to Claimants\u2019 failure to pay the required fees.\n\n470.\n\nClaimants also pursued claims against Respondent. These claims were unsuccessful for failure to pay court fees. According to Claimants, \"[i]n the present case, the expensive fees demanded by the Respondent\u2019s courts effectively amounted to a discriminatory prevention of access to justice and thus breached not only international customary law but also Article II of the Treaty which promised to afford investments fair and equitable treatment, as well as full protection and security and treatment equivalent to that required by international law.\" Romania also breached the umbrella clause under Article II(2)(c) of the BIT providing that \"Each party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments,\" \"any obligation\" including general undertakings contained in legislation or regulations, such as Law 99/1999.573\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 758.\n\n471.\n\nClaimants initiated a derivative action directly against Respondent based on the following theories: 1) the invalidity of the original title was due to Respondent\u2019s nationalization of Casa Bucur by Decree 92/1950; 2) although Respondent classified Casa Bucur as a historical monument, it then failed to take a series of follow-up action to implement that classification, thereby creating the representation that the estate was not a historical monument; 3) AVAS was directly involved in the lease agreement concluded between Alunis and SC Casa Bucur SRL. These claims failed for non-payment of court fees.574\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 761.\n\n472.\n\nAlfa El Bucur sought reimbursement of the price paid for Casa Bucur against the seller Street Comer, former SC Casa Bucur SRL based on Articles 1336 and 1337 of the 1864 Romanian Civil Code. The proceedings were suspended by Respondent\u2019s court for an alleged failure to cooperate with a court-appointed expert.575 According to Claimants, \"[i]n the present case, the expensive fees demanded by the Respondent\u2019s courts effectively amounted to a discriminatory prevention of access to justice and thus breached not only international customary law but also Articles. II of the Treaty which promised to afford investments fair and equitable treatment as well as full protection and security and treatment equivalent to that required by international law.\" Claimants cite *Loewen* v. *United States* for the proposition that where a foreign investor presents enough evidence that prohibitively high court fees affected its right to access to justice and effective remedies, tribunals will find in favour of the foreign investor.576\n\nCl.

The allegations consist of the following. One, the Heirs contested the legality of the investment, arguing that Alfa El Bucur failed to obtain mandatory authorizations from the Ministry of Culture for works performed on Casa Bucur, in contravention of the legislation on historical monuments. Two, the Heirs filed complaints before several government institutions accusing Alfa El Bucur of defrauding the Romanian Government by stealing and destroying a historical monument. On the basis of these accusations, the Ministry of Culture requested the prosecution of Alfa El Bucur. Three, the Heirs filed a criminal complaint against Hasan Awdi and his associates.577 The Bucharest Prosecutor dismissed all charges on 21 June 2010.578\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 769-770.\n\nCl.

The following developments are, therefore, made on a subsidiary basis and *ex abundante cautela\"580* These developments consist in the claims discussed above which Alfa El Romania pursued against the Heirs, the Respondent, and the seller of Casa Bucur. Claimants indicate that they \"did absolutely everything they could have reasonably done to seek compensation for the loss of the Casa Bucur Estate through domestic law. Yet every single one of the Claimants\u2019 endeavours, every single step they took towards seeking compensation, was simply shot down by the Respondent. Barriers were erected, court actions dismissed on spurious grounds, and treatment dealt that was so discriminatory it was utterly unfair.\"581\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 845.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 847.\n\nCl.

However, Gervase MacGregor states regarding the FTI report, \"Mr Grantham does not appear to conclude on an appropriate value of Casa Bucur. However, his report does refer to the purchase price and subsequent investments made to the estate and the alternative valuations set out in the FTI Report.\"583\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 898.\n\nMacGregor report, \u00b6 10.4\n\n(1) Purchase price and investments made by Claimants\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nRegarding the purchase price, the FTI report considers it to be USD 500,000 including VAT (EUR 466,179 \u2044 ROL 16,150,000), based on the Contract for Sale Purchase between Casa Bucur SRL and SC Alfa El Romania SRL of February 21, 2002.584 The MacGregor report does not offer its own figure on the purchase price of Casa Bucur. Rather, it looks at the three transactions surrounding the ultimate transfer of Casa Bucur to Claimants: first, Mona Lisa Trading Co SRL\u2019s acquisition of SC Alunis for EUR 146,203 (RON 2,924,000); second, Casa Bucur SRL\u2019s purchase of the restaurant from Mona Lisa Trading for RON 425,110; and, third, Alfa El Romania SRL\u2019s purchase of the Restaurant and Summer Kitchen from Casa Bucur SRL for USD 500,000 (EUR 5 54,800).585\n\nThe FTI report also notes a price of RON 1,357,142,86 listed in a memorandum addressed by a law office to the Ministry of Public Finance, \u00b6 11.5.\n\nFor a description of the three transactions see *supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 119-121.\n\n477.\n\nRegarding investments made in the Casa Bucur estate, the FTI report indicates that between 2002 and 2005, Alfa El Bucur invested EUR 2,879,472 (RON 10,508,348) including VAT in hotel improvements related to interior and exterior, hotel restaurant, furnishing, and information technology. The FTI report bases these figures on an invoice issued by the contractor who performed the works, Euro Hotels & Suites SRL, and addressed to Yourhotels dated March 2, 2005. The MacGregor report does not, here again, offer its own figure on the investments that Claimants made in Casa Bucur. Rather, it discusses the FTI report\u2019s comments that it is unable to rely on a single invoice as the practice of presenting one invoice at the end of works is unusual. Next, the MacGregor report relies on a figure found in a valuation report of Dr. Engineer Tache Parvulescu dated 1 August 2005. The figure is RON 8,830,544. This figure corresponds to the figure presented by the FTI report based on the invoice to Yourhotels.\n\n(2) Alternative valuations\n--------------------------\n\n478.\n\nRegarding alternative valuations, Claimants look at the value of Casa Bucur at or around March 2008 when the property was taken from Claimants. The FTI report presents three different figures in this regard: EUR 4.5 million, EUR 6.95 million, and EUR 12 million. The figure of EUR 4.5 million is listed in a press article reporting that John Mott (related to the Heirs) had offered the estate for sale and that the City Hall of Bucharest had the right of first refusal. The figure of EUR 6.95 million represents the sale price at which the property was listed on 23 October 2008, about six months after it was taken from Claimants.586 EUR 12 million is the figure obtained on 31 August 2012 when Claimants had instructed S.C. DGV Finance Consulting S.R.L. (\"DGC\") to perform a valuation of the estate for the purposes of this dispute.587\n\nFTI report, \u00b6 11.15.\n\nFTI report, \u00b6 11.16.\n\n479.\n\nThe FTI report questions the reliability of the EUR 4.5 million, noting that the figure likely understates the value of the estate because the article, which substantially pre-dates the Supreme Court decision, was written at a time when ownership of the property was still unresolved.588 The FTI report also questions the reliability of the EUR 6.95 million because it was listed purely as an advertisement and it is not clear whether a transaction had actually taken place. The MacGregor report agrees with the FTI report on these points.589\n\nFTI report, \u00b6 11.14.\n\nMacGregor report, \u00b6 10.8.\n\n480.\n\nAs alternative valuations, the MacGregor report offers three figures: the DGC figure of EUR 12 million (also referred to in the FTI report), EUR 11.3 million, which comes from a valuation performed by Constanta Marcu, and 10.78 million, which comes from a valuation performed by Daniel Fendu.590 The MacGregor report concludes by expressing confidence in the reliability of the valuations by Constanta Marcu and Daniel Fendu. Thus, taking the midpoint between the two valuations, the MacGregor report presents the figure of **EUR 11,044,000** as the value of Casa Bucur as of March 2OO8.591\n\nUnlike the FTI report, the MacGregor report provides a copy of the DGV report, MacGregor report, \u00b6 10.9.\n\n*Id:,* MacGregor report, \u00b6 2.11.\n\n481.\n\nIn their PHB, Claimants clarify that in addition to the acquisition cost of **USD 500,000,** they are claiming **EUR 10 million** which correspond to (1) works performed on the estate between 2002 and November 2005, and (2) the loss of profit on the hotel and restaurant.592\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 102.\n\n482.\n\nCiting *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt,593 Vivendi* v. *Argentina,594 &n\u00e0 Azurix* v. *Argentina595* in support, Claimants argue that \"[i]nternational tribunals rely on all the expenditures relating to the investment... to determine the market value of the investment to be compensated. As such, the acquisition and sunk costs mentioned above could, most certainly, be used as a \u2018proxy.\u2019\"596 Claimants add that the actual investment approach would, however, lead to undercompensation under Article III of the BIT and the Chorz\u00f3w factory principle. Therefore, the actual investment should be the floor, and the Tribunal should also take into account lost profits which are estimated to be **EUR 11 million / 10,780,000** in 12 years.597\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd.* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2002, \u00b6 125 (RLA-124).\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and J\u2019ivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case.

According to Respondent, this should be the basis for disregarding the FTI report in these proceedings.606\n\n[No footnote in the PDF]\n\n487.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position is that Rodipet and all the other companies in the Rodipet Group had minimal, if any, value.607 However, Claimants point out that \"Respondent\u2019s quantum expert did not provide any alternative valuation to help the Tribunal assess the amount of damages to be awarded to the Claimants should a violation of the Treaty be found.\"608\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 617.\n\n489.\n\nRespondent notes that the enforcement of the Pledge which made AVAS the owner of 51% of the shares of Rodipet has not prevented Claimants from presenting a calculation of the entire value of Rodipet.610\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 649; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 613.\n\n490.\n\nRegarding Claimants\u2019 valuation of Rodipet, Respondent submits that Rodipet has historically been loss making. It only made a profit in 2008 due to non-recurring income which, as such, should be discounted. Once this income is discounted, Rodipet actually made a loss of RON 25 million in 2008. Respondent also submits that the DCF method cannot appropriately be used in this instance, but assuming it could be, the FTI report overvalues Rodipet by EUR 40.7 million because it erroneously adds depreciation to earnings when it should have subtracted it.611 Respondent argues that the MacGregor report undermines the FTI report but it still itself carries the major flaw of erroneously assuming that Rodipet still owned the rights to conduct its core business on the date of the alleged expropriation.612 In addition, the MacGregor report\u2019s forecast of the expansion of the kiosk network and discount rate are unrealistic.613\n\nResp.

According to Respondent, Claimants have failed to prove that Supremo was expropriated as they have also failed to prove that they even own Supremo.617\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 655.\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 626.\n\n496.\n\nRespondent adds that \"to the extent that Rodipet is valued (and claimed for) as a going concern, no separate claim can be made for a single asset, which is included in the valuation of the entire business.\"622 Further, \"the alleged \u2018concession\u2019 could not be legally transferred, it would have no market value as an asset.\"623 Respondent points out that the MacGregor report accepts that the concession has no value as an asset since it cannot be sold.624 The part of the MacGregor report that Respondent refers to is provided in full below:\n\nI agree with Mr Grantham that the Concession cannot be sold or transferred and therefore has no value without Rodipet. [...]\n\nThe difference between me and Mr Grantham (and between FTI and Mr Grantham) is essentially this: Mr Grantham believes that the Concession has no value. I think that the Concession does have value. Even if it can only be used by one entity, it has value to that entity and any company investing in that entity. Furthermore, Mr Grantham appears to accept that its value may have been equal to the rent saved.625\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 661.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 662.\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 628.\n\n498.\n\nRespondent submits its own calculation of \"the expected savings for Rodipet (not the Claimants or anyone else) assuming that Law 442 on Rodipet continued in place, and Rodipet had concessions under it for all its kiosks.\" The figure at which Andrew Grantham arrives is **RON 153,468** (about **USD 51,000** or **EUR 36,300)** as of 30 June 2009. According to Respondent, the proportion of **RON 153,468** that can be attributed to Magnar\u2019s shareholding in Rodipet is the \"absolute maximum amount\" that Claimants could claim as compensation.627\n\nResp.

Additional claim*\n---------------------\n\n(i) Lost properties\n-------------------\n\n500.\n\nRespondent points out that the residential properties and other properties being claimed for by Claimants are identified as being owned by third parties (Orion, Project Four, and Project One SRL); as such, \"[i]t is unclear on what legal basis the Claimants are claiming compensation for losses allegedly suffered by such third parties; none is asserted in the Memorial.\"628 Respondent also points out that \"Claimants have failed to demonstrate how the loss of these properties by other companies was caused by the change in Rodipet ownership.\"629 As far as the forcible sale of some of the properties at nominal value, Respondent notes that Claimants\u2019 evidence shows that there was only one sale of property which was caused by Rodipet\u2019s failure to meet its obligations such as paying taxes and certain employee benefits.630\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 665.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 666.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 667.\n\n(ii) Moral damages\n------------------\n\n501.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the standard for awarding moral damages in investment arbitration is strict. It requires the existence of \"exceptional\" circumstances and fulfilment of the three cumulative conditions enumerated in *Lemire* v. *Ukraine,* as follows:\n\n[1] the State\u2019s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;\n\n[2] the State\u2019s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position; and\n\n[3] both cause and effect are grave or substantial.631\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 670; *Lemire* v. *Ukraine,* \u00b6 333.\n\n502.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 claim for moral damages must fail because Claimants\u2019 circumstances are not \"exceptional\" and Claimants\u2019 allegations have already been dismissed during the Provisional Measures phase.632 Respondent counters Claimants\u2019 request that the Tribunal reconsider its ruling in PO No. 1 by arguing that there is no reason to change the ruling since no new arguments have been presented on the issue.633\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 672.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 639.\n\n503.\n\nAccording to Respondent, *Desert Line* v. *Yemen* is the only investment arbitration case that has led to an award of moral damages because of the truly exceptional circumstances in that case. Still, that moral damages award was only USD 1 million. Thus, Claimants\u2019 request for 5% of awarded damages or no less than EUR 10 million is \"preposterous.\"634\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 676.\n\n*d. Casa Bucur*\n---------------\n\n504.\n\nRespondent raises a four-point objection to Claimants\u2019 request for compensation for Casa Bucur. First, because Alfa El Romania acquired Casa Bucur from Street Comer, its claim for compensation for the price paid for, and improvements made to, Casa Bucur should be presented to Street Comer.635 Second, Respondent questions the validity of Claimants\u2019 method of valuing Casa Bucur, which consists of simply taking the average of two other reports whose independence and reliability Respondent also questions, especially when the authors of these reports were not available to Respondent for cross-examination at the hearing.636 Third, Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 valuation did not take into account the fact that Alfa El Romania had assigned rights to Casa Bucur for 10 years and was receiving in return USD 650 per month, for a total of USD 78,000 for the entire period. Thus, any buyer would have been paid significantly less for the property under those conditions.637 Fourth, Respondent claims that \"Claimants have not based their case on Casa Soare as an \u2018investment\u2019 but rather on the shares in the various companies including Alfa El Romania and Street Comer...,\"638\n\nResp, C-Mem., \u00b6 668.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 632-33.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 634.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 635.\n\n505.\n\nIn addition, Respondent addresses the different requests for compensation pursued by Claimants under Laws 10/2001 and 99/1999 and against the Heirs, Romanian State and its various entities.\n\n506.\n\nWith regard to the claims against the Heirs, the Claimants\u2019 first claim of unjust enrichment under Law 10/2001 and the civil code failed because the cause of action was available to tenants affected by restitution, not those with apparent ownership. The second claim of unjust enrichment failed due to unpaid court fees. The Claimants\u2019 request for a declaration of a right of retention failed also due to unpaid court fees. The Claimants\u2019 request for interim relief failed because Alfa El Romania did not substantiate the urgency of their request.639\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 382.\n\n507.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants did not qualify for direct compensation under Law 99/1999 which for them represented \"an all-encompassing insurance policy for legal risk in Romania.\"640 Respondent states that Article 32^4 does not exist in Law 99/1999. Respondent further states:\n\n[I]f reference is being made to Article 43(1) and (2) of Title I of Law 99/1999 (or Article 32^4 (1) and (2) of Government Emergency Ordinance 88/1997 as amended), these do contain a guarantee of compensation to companies \u2018privatised or under privatisation\u2019 affected by restitution of property to rightful owners; but no such right of compensation is granted directly to investors acquiring shares in privatised companies, or companies acquiring properties from such companies such as the Claimants, Mona Lisa, Street Corner or Alfa El Romania.\n\n\u2026\n\n[...] the Claimants are not universal successors of Alunis, nor is the right to compensation a right which passes to whoever acquires the property affected by restitution.\n\nIn the circumstances, if anyone could possibly have had a right to directly claim compensation for the restitution of property to the Soares under Title I of Law 99/1999, that could only have been Alunis. Nonetheless... Alunis never requested compensation for the restitution and the Claimants only have themselves to blame for this: Street Comer and Alfa El Romania never sought damages from Alunis as a result of the frustrated sales. Consequently, Alunis never suffered any damage that fell to be remedied by way of compensation under Article 43(1) and (2) of Title I of Law 99/1999.641\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 384.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 384-88.\n\n508.\n\nWith regard to the two claims Alfa El Romania filed under Title I of Law 99/1999 against the Romanian State and its entities, both claims failed due to Alfa El Romania\u2019s refusal to pay court fees642 but would have failed in any event notwithstanding that. According to Respondent, if on the one hand Alfa El Romania was asserting a right in its own name and behalf as successor of Alunis, that would constitute a direct claim which would have failed for the reasons already explained. If, on the other hand, Alfa El Romania was requesting AVAS to pay Alunis through an oblique claim, Alfa El Romania would have had to establish the existence of a claimable debt between Alunis and AVAS under Article 43(1) and (2) of Title I of Law 99/1999. This would have required proving that Alunis suffered damages as a consequence of the restitution of Casa Soare. This, Alfa El Romania would have failed to prove because Alunis\u2019 interest in Casa Soare ceased since October 2001.643 For Respondent, \"[I]t is hard to understand how Romania can be accused of failing to pay compensation or grant adequate means of redress to the Claimants when in fact not one single claim for compensation was filed in accordance with the conditions set out in the law.\"644\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 389.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 389-91.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 392.\n\n509.\n\nIn response to Claimants\u2019 assertion that the Supreme Court failed to decide Claimants\u2019 counter-claim, Respondent indicates that the Bucharest Tribunal dismissed the counter-claim, as mentioned in Decision No. 9227/2005. The counter-claim was not appealed to the Supreme Court which then had no power to decide it.645\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 326.\n\n510.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2019 request for sunk costs in their PHB, Respondent answers by pointing out that Claimants did not make a request for relief for sunk costs, Respondent never had a chance to address such request, and the Tribunal cannot grant the request under the circumstances. Therefore, the issue is irrelevant.646\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 96.\n\n*e. Interest*\n-------------\n\n511.\n\nRespondent characterizes as inappropriate, novel, and unsupported by legal authority Claimants\u2019 request to use the WACC, *i.e.* be compensated for the lost opportunity to re-invest the funds of which Claimants were deprived as a consequence of the Treaty breach. According to Respondent, in neither of the two cases *(Vivendi* v. *Argentina* and *Alpha* v. *Ukraine)647* cited by Claimants did the Tribunal award interest at such high rate.648 For these reasons, Respondent submits that Claimants misunderstand the function of interest because WACC is focused on the risk of investing in a company, whereas interest is focused on compensating for not being paid compensation.649 Instead of the WACC proposed by Claimants, Respondent proposes using a risk free rate such as US Treasury Bonds.650\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina,* Award, \u00b6 9.2.8; *Alpha* v. *Ukraine,* \u00b6\u00b6 483, 514.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 677-79.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 641.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 680.\n\n512.\n\nRespondent cites the International Law Commission as authority against compounding any awarded interest. Respondent contends that the award of compound interest has been inconsistent in the jurisprudence and most Tribunal award simple interest. In fact, \"there is today no \u2018rule in international law on interest\u2019 and... simple interest is the norm in international investment law.\"651 Respondent cite a long line of cases in support of its position.652\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 644.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 681.\n\n513.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimants\u2019 alternative request for 3-month Euribor + 4.25% corresponding to the rate used in the BancPost loan. According to Respondent, interest has nothing to do with the cost of credit to Rodipet.653\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 643.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. Regarding Rodipet**\n------------------------\n\n514.\n\nAs evidenced by the Tribunal\u2019s analysis regarding Law 442 and the enforcement of the Pledge, only the breach of the fair and equitable treatment under Articles II (2)(a)(b) and XII regarding Law 442 entails Respondent\u2019s liability to compensate Claimants.654 In assessing the amount of compensation, the Tribunal shall disregard Claimants\u2019 analysis and conclusions based as they are on expropriation, a BIT violation that has been excluded.655 In view of the violation of the fair and equitable treatment due to the repeal of Law 442, the Tribunal considers appropriate to base compensation on sunk costs, namely on the amount invested by Claimants regarding Rodipet in the expectation that such amount would have been earned back had Law 442 remained in force. The application of the DCF method relied upon by Claimants as \"the most appropriate way to determine the fair market value\"656 is not justified in the circumstances. This is because Rodipet is not a going concern, it has a history of losses. There are moreover uncertainties regarding future income and costs of an investment in this industry in the Romanian market.\n\n*Supra,\u00b6\u00b6* 332-333.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 325.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 810.\n\n515.\n\nAs previously determined, the amount of Claimants\u2019 investment accepted by the Tribunal is equal to EUR 7,543,176,59 on the date of repeal of Law 442, 10 July 2OO8.657 Respondent is hereby ordered to pay Hassan Awdi and EBC658 the above amount as overall compensation regarding claims for Rodipet. No compensation shall be granted with regard to other companies of the so-called Rodipet Group659 in the absence of evidence that their involvement had profited Rodipet and had been accepted by AVAS as falling within the scope of the Privatization Contract.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 273 and 332.\n\nAccording to Claimants, these are the Claimants that were affected by Respondent\u2019s actions regarding Rodipet: Cl. Rep., \u00b642.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 447-449 (Rodipet Courier), \u00b6\u00b6 450-451 (Supremo Media), \u00b6\u00b6 452-453 (Balbec Retail).\n\n516.\n\nClaimants\u2019 claim for moral damages is dismissed for the reasons set forth in the provisional measures phase.660 No claim for lost property may be considered in the absence of evidence regarding the basis of the claim, including the causation between the breach and the damage, and the ownership of the properties.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 - Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 56-60.\n\n**2. Regarding Casa Bucur**\n---------------------------\n\n517.\n\nContrary to Claimants\u2019 contention, Alfa El Corporation did not lose its investment in Casa Bucur by reason of Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT. As previously held by the Tribunal,661 Respondent breached Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations by failing to return the price paid for the purchase of Casa Soare despite under Law 99/1999 companies \"privatized or under privatization\" would have been entitled to compensation in case of restitution of immovable assets to the former heirs.662 Since Street Comer had accepted the risk of restitution of the property, the only claim that is accepted by the Tribunal is the claim for reimbursement of the price paid for acquiring Casa Bucur on 31 March 1999, based on an arm\u2019s length transaction, i.e. a price corresponding to EUR 147,352. Claimants\u2019 claim for reimbursement of amounts spent for restoring the property is dismissed for the same reason. Respondent shall pay said amount of EUR 147,352 to Alfa El Corporation as overall compensation for breach of the fair and equitable treatment under Article Il(2)(a) of the BIT regarding Claimants\u2019 claims for Casa Bucur.663\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 440.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 466.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 440-441.\n\n**3. Interest**\n---------------\n\n518.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article III(l) of the BIT provides for interest on compensation \"at a commercially reasonable rate.\" Even if this is not a case of expropriation, the commercially reasonable rate is a criterion of general application which will be retained by the Tribunal. EURIBOR +2% being a commercially reasonable rate, it is adopted by the Tribunal.\n\n519.\n\nCompound interest is increasingly recognised in the field of investment protection as better reflecting current business and economic reality, therefore actual damages suffered by a party. Interest shall therefore be compounded semi-annually. Interest shall run from 6 September 2008 regarding compensation in the case of Rodipet664 and from 20 March 2008 regarding compensation in the case of Casa Bucur,665 until full payment in both cases.\n\nThis being the date indicated in the MacGregor report for the value of the Concession (\u00b6 2.13), as being the date of revocation of Law 442.\n\nThis being the date on which the Romanian police seized Casa Bucur estate (Cl. Mem., \u00b6 17).\n\n**IX. RECONSIDERATION OF PARA. 31(C) OF PO 2**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nRespondent has requested reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s decision under paragraph 31(c) of Procedural Order No. 2 charging Respondent with reimbursing Claimants 50% of costs incurred by them to gain access to documents seized in the frame of criminal investigations in implementation of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n521.\n\nAccording to Respondent, only a limited number of documents obtained through the access process were filed by Claimants in this arbitration.666 Further, in its view access to documents was a technique to interfere with the criminal proceedings, to obtain access to critical evidence and to put pressure on Respondent to suspend investigation.667 Claimants have not disputed this request.668\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 688.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 689.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 646.\n\n522.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the limited number of obtained documents that have been produced by Claimants is not a significant element and, further, that still in May 2014 Claimants have complained about the \"incomplete and lacunae-filled return of documents to the Claimants.\"669 Failing convincing reasons for its reconsideration, the decision under Procedural Order No. 2 is maintained.\n\nLetter by Claimants\u2019 Counsel to the Tribunal, copied to Respondent\u2019s counsel, dated 26 May 2014, p. 2.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n523.\n\nThe Parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on 19 November 2014, and simultaneous reply submission on costs on 1 December 2014.\n\n524.\n\nIn their submissions on costs, Claimants argue that Respondent should be held accountable in bearing the total arbitration costs incurred by Claimants, including legal fees and expenses, in the total amount of EUR 2,373,460,89 USD 1,314,073,31 and GBP 4,862,19. Claimants make their claim on the basis of Respondent\u2019s taking advantage of its position as a State to hinder the Claimants\u2019 ability to present their investment case by, *inter alia,* launching multiple criminal proceedings, confiscating and sequestrating documents, using the aforementioned criminal proceedings in the ICSID arbitration, etc. The phase of access to documents is but one example of these abusive tactics. It took two Procedural Orders for Respondent to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s decision and, even then, Respondent made sure that Claimants\u2019 situation was as precarious as possible. Respondent does not stop at the challenge of Claimants\u2019 request but goes as far as requesting reimbursement by Claimants of its own costs and expenses albeit Respondent\u2019s costs are completely unreasonable and its procedural behaviour precludes any finding on costs to its benefit. In conclusion, Claimants request the Tribunal to (i) confirm the decision on costs issued in Procedural Order No. 2, (ii) order Respondent to bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including Claimants\u2019 legal fees, and (iii) dismiss all of Respondent\u2019s claim and defences with regard to the costs of these proceedings.\n\n525.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Respondent requests that Claimants bear all costs incurred by it in this arbitration proceeding, which include a total of USD 660,687,22 as fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID, a total of EUR 4,503,204,67 as legal fees and EUR 341,936,45 as expenses, and a total of EUR 502,356,10 as costs for Respondent\u2019s experts and consultants.\n\n526.\n\nIn their reply submission on costs, Claimants opposed Respondent\u2019s request for costs and rebutted Respondent\u2019s basis for its request that such costs be charged to Claimants.\n\n527.\n\nIn its reply submission on costs, Respondent requested that the Tribunal reject Claimants\u2019 application for \"costs and expenses incurred in the period from 29 March 2011 to 15 November 2011\" in the amount of EUR 482,336,65 as being clearly excessive considering that during that period the actual proceedings were suspended.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n528.\n\nThe Tribunal has the power to order costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\nIt is recognized that in awarding costs the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion, subject to the exercise of discretion being explained, as required by Article 48(3) providing that \"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\"670\n\nChristoph Schreuer et al\" The ICSID Convention- A Commentary, 2nd edition 2009, p. 1235, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.\n\n529.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while the traditional position in investment arbitration has been that the parties bear their own legal costs and share equally the costs of the arbitration, there have been a number of cases which have departed from this principle and have awarded costs on a \"loser pays\" basis. The Tribunal finds that, in the circumstances of this particular arbitration, the application of the \"loser pays\" principle is to some extent appropriate. The Tribunal does not believe that either Party\u2019s procedural conduct should be an additional basis for awarding costs, the complexity of the case and the sensitivity of many of the issues involved explaining the extraordinary amount of the evidence produced.\n\n530.\n\nThe outcome of the case has been to some extent in Claimants\u2019 favour, the Tribunal having rejected Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional and admissibility objections. As to the merits, Claimants have been successful regarding Rodipet by reason of Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET standard in connection with the repeal of Law 442 and regarding Casa Bucur by reason of Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET standard regarding failure to compensate for the price paid for the taking of the property, leading in both cases to a monetary compensation in Claimants\u2019 favour.\n\n531.\n\nIn view of the outcome of the case, the Tribunal considers appropriate that Respondent reimburse Claimants for part of the latter\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of USD one million. The Tribunal additionally considers appropriate that each Party bear in full all other legal fees and costs it has incurred and equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID facilities.\n\n**XI. TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n---------------------------\n\n532.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n1. The Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence to hear Claimants\u2019 claims, Respondent\u2019s jurisdiction and admissibility objections being dismissed.\n\n2. Respondent shall pay Mr Hassan Awdi and EBC the amount of EUR 7,543,176,59 as compensation for breach of FET standard regarding Rodipet, increased by interest at the EURIBOR +2%, compounded semi-annually, as from 6 September 2008 until full payment.\n\n3. Respondent shall pay Alfa El Corporation the amount of EUR 147,352 as compensation for breach of FET standard regarding Casa Bucur, increased by interest at the EURIBOR +2%, compounded semi-annually, as from 20 March 2008 until full payment.\n\n4. Respondent shall pay Claimants the amounts of:\n\na) USD one million, as reimbursement of part of Claimants\u2019 legal fees and costs;\n\nb) EUR 482,336,65, as reimbursement of Claimants\u2019 50% of costs incurred for gaining access to documents seized in the frame of criminal investigations, as provided by para. 31(c) of P.O. No. 2.\n\nAll amounts due under this paragraph 4 shall bear interest at the EURIBOR +2%, compounded semi-annually, until fully paid.\n\n5. Each Party shall bear in full all other legal fees and costs it has incurred and equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID facilities.\n\n6. All other claims and requests for relief by either Party are dismissed."}]}
