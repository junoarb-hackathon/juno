INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute is submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Hungarian People's Republic for Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 2 September 1987, which entered into force on 1 June 1988 (the \"Netherlands BIT\"), the Agreement Between the Swiss Confederation and the Hungarian People's Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 5 October 1988, which entered into force on 16 May 1989 (the \"Swiss BIT\" and jointly with the Netherlands BIT, the \"Treaties\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\"). The Hungarian People's Republic ratified the ICSID Convention on 4 February 1987 and it entered into force for Hungary on 6 March 1987.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Emmis International Holding, B.V. (\"Emmis International\"), Emmis Radio Operating, B.V. (\"Emmis Radio\"), and Mem Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft (\"MEM\"). Emmis International and Emmis Radio are both corporations organized and existing under the laws of the Netherlands with their principal place of business in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. MEM is a company organized and existing under the laws of Hungary, allegedly controlled by a Swiss national. These parties will be collectively referred to hereinafter as \"Claimants.\"\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is Hungary and is referred to as \"Hungary\" or \"Respondent.\"\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent will be hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n5.\n\nThe Parties' respective legal counsel of record in this arbitration are listed above on page (i). Claimants were represented by Covington & Burling until 17 January 2013, when, with the consent of the Claimants, that firm came off the record. On 8 February 2013, following a suspension of the proceedings ordered by the Tribunal in order to enable the Claimants to appoint new counsel, the firm of Quinn Emanuel was appointed to represent the Claimants in this arbitration.\n\n6.\n\nThe dispute relates to the alleged unlawful treatment accorded by Respondent to a national FM-radio frequency broadcasting licensee in which Claimants held their investments. Respondent submits an objection pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), alleging that certain of the disputes set forth in Claimants' request for arbitration shall be dismissed for manifest lack of legal merit because Hungary did not accord its consent to submit such disputes to ICSID arbitration. This ruling decides on Respondent's objection after careful consideration of the Parties' written submissions and oral presentations at the occasion of the First Session.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Request for Arbitration**\n----------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, ICSID received a request for arbitration on behalf of Emmis International, Emmis Radio, MEM, Accession Mezzanine Capital L.P. and Danubius Kereskedoh\u00e1z Vagyonkezelo Zrt against Hungary.1\n\n*See* Request for Arbitration, n2.\n\n8.\n\nHungary presented communications dated 16 November 2011, and 4 and 7 December 2011, objecting to the registration of the 28 October 2011 request. The Requesting Parties submitted a response to such letters on 18 and 30 November, 2011 and 6 December 2011.\n\n9.\n\nOn 9 December 2011, the Centre reminded the Requesting Parties that \"the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of *an investment* \" (emphasis added) and notified them that \"[i]n the absence of consent by all disputing parties to join disputes relating to manifestly separate investments, the Secretary-General cannot proceed to register the Request for Arbitration as submitted to the Centre.\"2\n\nLetter from ICSID Secretary General to the Parties, dated 9 December 2011.\n\n10.\n\nAccordingly, on 27 December 2012, the Centre received two separate requests for arbitration against Hungary. One request was filed on behalf of the Claimants in this arbitration, as defined in paragraph 2 above, which allege to be investors in Sl\u00e0ger R\u00e1dio Musorzolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Zrt (\"Sl\u00e0ger Radio\") (the \"Request\" or \"Request for Arbitration\"). Another request for arbitration was filed on behalf of the other claimants in the request of 28 October 2011. This second separate request for arbitration was registered under ICSID Case No. ARB/12/3, being heard by a distinct arbitral tribunal.3\n\nClaimants to this arbitration and the claimants in ICSID Arbitration ARB/12/3 appointed Mr. Marc Lalonde to both proceedings (*see* Procedural Details of ICSID Arbitration No. ARB/12/3, publicly available on the ICSID website, at https://icsid.worldbank.org, last visited on 8 December 2012). The other two members of each of the arbitral tribunals differ.\n\n11.\n\nOn 18 January 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated April 6, 2012, Claimants communicated to the Centre the Parties' agreement on the method of constitution of the Tribunal. In accordance with this method, the Tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators: one member of the Arbitral Tribunal appointed by each of the Parties and the third arbitrator, who would act as its President, to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators in consultation with the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nFollowing this agreement, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and is composed of Professor Campbell McLachlan QC, a national of New Zealand, President, appointed by agreement of the co-arbitrators in consultation with the Parties; the Honorable Marc Lalonde QC, a national of Canada, appointed by Claimants; and Mr J. Christopher Thomas QC, a national of Canada, appointed by Respondent.\n\n14.\n\nOn 15 August 2012, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"). Ms Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objection and the First Session of the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 August 2012, Respondent submitted Preliminary Objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) (\"Rule 41(5) Objection\"). As further detailed below, Hungary objected to two categories of claims in the Amended Request in each case on the ground that it has not consented to arbitration in respect of such claims pursuant to the instruments of consent, being the relevant provisions of the Treaties, namely:\n\n(1) Treaty claims other than expropriation;4 and,\n\n(2) Customary international law claims.5\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, [18] - [31].\n\nIbid, [32] - [36].\n\n16.\n\nOn 4 September 2012, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties a draft Agenda of the items to be discussed at the first session of the Tribunal (the \"Draft Agenda\"). The Draft Agenda included an item for Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n17.\n\nOn 18 September 2012, Claimants filed their Response on Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objection. The Claimants submitted that \"Respondent's invocation of Rule 41(5) is unnecessary, and the Tribunal need not consider the merits of the Objection.\" Claimants contended that inclusion of the contested claims in the Request for Arbitration was proper, as Respondent could have chosen to consent to arbitrate these claims, but acknowledged that Respondent had refused to consent to arbitrate non-expropriation claims in this case.\n\n18.\n\nOn 19 September 2012, the Parties submitted their Joint Statement (the \"Statement\") on the Draft Agenda. As to the Rule 41(5) Objection, the Statement recorded:6\n\nFollowing Claimants' letter of 18 September 2012, the Parties agree that a schedule of written pleadings, evidence or a hearing on the Rule 41(5) Objection filed by Respondent is unnecessary.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal issue a brief decision on the Rule 41(5) Objection confirming that the dispute before the Tribunal is limited to claims of expropriation under the Netherlands-Hungary and Switzerland-Hungary bilateral investment treaties. Claimants contend that, for the reasons stated in their letter of 18 September 2012, it was unnecessary for Respondent to submit a Rule 41(5) objection and that the Tribunal need only take note of Claimants' position as stated in their letter of 18 September 2012.\n\nStatement, [13].\n\n19.\n\nOn 20 September 2012, the Respondent submitted observations on the question whether a decision from the Tribunal on the Rule 41(5) Objection was still required, to which Claimants responded by letter of 24 September 2012.\n\n20.\n\nThe First Session of the Tribunal was held via video conference on 24/25 September 2012.7 During this session, the Parties were given an opportunity to be heard by the Tribunal on the disposition of the Rule 41(5) Objection. The Tribunal raised with the Parties the question whether it would help in clarifying the scope of the proceedings, in the light of the measure of agreement already reached between the parties, if the Claimants were to file a revised amended request, striking through those passages that the Claimants accepted could not be pursued within the framework of the present arbitration. Both parties accepted this proposal, although the Respondent maintained its position that it was in addition entitled to a ruling on its Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\nThe Parties and the Secretary of the Tribunal meet at the offices of the World Bank in Washington D.C. to attend the first session, while the members of the Tribunal joined via video-conference, each from Montreal, London and Wellington. Given the time differences, the President of the Tribunal presided the session on 25 September 2012, while it was still 24 September 2012 for the other members of the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n21.\n\nOn 5 October 2012, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO No1\"), setting out the procedural rules that Claimants and Respondent have agreed to, and that the Arbitral Tribunal has determined, should govern this arbitration. The Parties confirmed, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and agreed on a schedule of pleadings for the merits phase.\n\n22.\n\nSection 13 of PO No1 also embodied the Tribunal's determination with regard to the next steps to be taken in connection with the Rule 41(5) Objection. It provided:\n\n13.1 Following Claimants' letter of 18 September 2012, the Parties have agreed that a schedule of written pleadings, evidence or a hearing on the Rule 41(5) Objection filed by Respondent is unnecessary.\n\n13.2 Claimants shall file by Friday 19 October 2012 an amended Request for Arbitration striking through the passages referring to any non-expropriation claims that it considers no longer pending before this Tribunal on the basis of Respondent's lack of consent to submit those disputes to ICSID arbitration, as set forth in Claimants' correspondence of 18 and 24 September 2012.\n\n13.3 Upon receipt of the Amended Request for Arbitration referred to in \u00a7 13.2 above, the Respondent shall have 10 business days within which to notify the Claimants and the Tribunal as to whether it maintains any objection that the Amended Request has correctly removed those claims that Claimants have agreed may not be pursued in these proceedings, following which the Tribunal will determine whether further relief, if any, is required under this paragraph.\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 October 2012 Claimants submitted a Revised Amended Request for Arbitration striking through certain passages of the Request for Arbitration and amending others (the \"Revised Amended Request\").\n\n24.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, Respondent filed its observations on the Revised Amended Request. Hungary submitted that \"the Revised Request *fails to remove* allegations of breaches of various treaty provisions not relating to expropriation, and *maintains* the request that the Tribunal declare that Hungary has breached customary international law.\"8 Respondent filed an alternative strike-through version of the Revised Amended Request in order to clarify those portions of the Request to which it maintained an objection.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 26 October 2012, 2, references omitted, emphasis in original.\n\n25.\n\nThe Parties exchanged additional letters on Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objection, on 30 October 2012 from Claimants and on 7 November 2012 from both Parties. On 28 November 2012, the Tribunal granted Respondent a short opportunity to reply, which it did on 10 December 2012. By letter of 7 December 2012, Claimants declined a final opportunity to file additional observations on Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal summarises below, insofar as relevant for the present Decision (i) the dispute; (ii) the claims; and (iii) the relief sought, as presented by Claimants in their Revised Amended Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal adopts no position with regard to the facts as described below. The Rule 41(5) Objection in the present proceedings relates solely to the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* by virtue of the instruments of consent. Accordingly, the Tribunal makes no ruling, at this stage in the proceedings, on the substantive merits of the Claimants' claims. For the purpose of such a determination, the arbitral tribunal must not prejudge the merits of the case. On the contrary, it must ordinarily presume the facts which found the claim on the merits as alleged by the claimant to be true (unless they are plainly without any foundation). In the application of those presumed facts to the legal question of its jurisdiction, the tribunal must then decide whether, as matter of law, those facts fall within or outside the scope of the consent to arbitrate. Where the objection is taken under the procedure provided in Rule 41(5), it will decide to grant the objection if one or more of the claims fall clearly outside the scope of its jurisdiction so that, for the purpose of these proceedings, the claim must be treated as being \"manifestly without legal merit\".\n\n**A. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants' case arises out of the alleged unlawful expropriation of the Claimants' investments in and related to, Sl\u00e0ger Radio, a Hungarian company and holder of one of the two national radio-broadcasting FM frequencies in Hungary.\n\n28.\n\nHungary's National Radio and Television Broadcasting Board (ORTT) first awarded Sl\u00e0ger Radio a seven-year license in 1997 after a competitive tender process, which was renewed in 2004 for a five year period.9 In 2009, ORTT published a call for tender for the issuance of the license held by Sl\u00e0ger Radio.\n\n*See* Revised Amended Request, [38]-[39].\n\n29.\n\nClaimants contend that this last tender procedure was \"highly irregular\" and \"unlawful.\"10 It \"did not accord... incumbent licensees, the preference in the tender guaranteed by Hungarian Law\" and \"the prevailing bidders (i) had prohibited conflicts of interest that should have disqualified their bids; (ii) no national broadcasting experience. and (iii) unfeasible business plans, among other irregularities.\"11\n\nIbid, [3].\n\nIdem; *see also* [43]-[50].\n\n30.\n\nIn addition, Claimants' allege, the prevailing bidders did not comply with the requirements of the applicable Media Law and the rules governing the tender, and had close ties with the two leading political parties in Hungary, which was an important factor in the overall result of the relevant bidding process.12\n\nIbid, [51]-[53].\n\n31.\n\nMoreover, the new bidders were awarded the frequencies \"even before the Hungarian courts could investigate the irregularities making the tender illegal\" and subsequently, \"the Hungarian Media Law has been altered to ensure that there is no effective remedy under Hungarian Law for violations of the tender procedures\\_\"13\n\nIbid, [4]; *see also* [54]-[62].\n\n32.\n\nThus, according to the Request, the Government's decision to conduct a highly irregular and unlawful tender procedures that concluded in the replacement of Sl\u00e0ger Radio as licensee of one of the two national radio-broadcasting frequencies after successfully operating for 12 years, resulted in the Claimant's expropriation of its investment (including the value of the stock of Sl\u00e0ger Radio, its operations and related assets).\n\n**B. The Claims**\n-----------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants, by their Revised Amended Request dated 18 October 2012, have indicated those claims which they continue to contend they are entitled to pursue in the present arbitration. The Tribunal reproduces below the relevant portions, in the form submitted by the Claimants pursuant to PO No1, showing the passages that the Claimants have already accepted should be struck through as being outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction:\n\n65. The Respondent's measures described in the preceding paragraphs have expropriated, or nationalized, without compensation and without complying with the other requirements imposed by applicable law, the investments of Emmis International, Emmis Radio and MEM in and related to Sl\u00e1ger Radio and its operating activities. \\_\n\n67. The Respondent's measures described above also violate its obligations under the Netherlands Treaty and the Switzerland Treaty (including the provisions of treaties with other States that are incorporated by the most-favored-nation principle of Article 3(2) of the Netherlands Treaty and Article 4(2) of the Switzerland Treaty), and customary international law.\n\n68. The Respondent's additional violations of the Treaties include: (i) failure to observe obligations attendant upon a direct or indirect expropriation of an investment; (ii) failure to ensure and afford fair and equitable treatment to investments; (iii) failure to observe the duty not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments; (iv) nationality discrimination against the Claimants and in favor of Hungarian nationals in the award of radio-broadcasting licenses; and (v) failure to observe obligations entered into with regard to investments. \\_\n\n69. Respondent's violations of customary international law include ~~(i) breach of the international minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors and (ii)~~the expropriation without compensation of Claimant's investments without observance of due process and payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation equal to the fair market value of the investments.14\n\nIbid, [65]-[69], references omitted.\n\n**C. Relief Sought**\n--------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants continue to seek from the Tribunal *, inter alia*, the following formal relief:\n\na. Declaring that the Respondent has breached the Treaties: ~~i.~~ by expropriating the Claimants' investments without complying with the requirements of the Treaties, including payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation;\n\n~~ii. by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investments;~~\n\n~~iii. by taking unreasonable or discriminatory measures that impaired the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the Claimants' investments; and~~\n\n~~iv. by discriminating against the Claimants and in favor of Hungarian~~ ~~nationals in the award of the radios-broadcasting licenses; and~~\n\n~~iv. by failing to observe obligations entered into with respect to Claimants' investments;~~\n\nb. Declaring that the Respondent has breached customary international law ~~i. by violating the minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors; and ii.~~ by expropriating the Claimants' investments without observance of due process and payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\"15\n\nIbid, [72].\n\n**IV. RELEVANT LEGAL TEXTS**\n----------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal sets forth below the legal texts relevant to decide on Respondent's Objections under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n**A. The ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention, which is found within Chapter II headed \"Jurisdiction of the Centre\", provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n37.\n\nArticle 42(1), which is found within Chapter IV Section 3 of the Convention headed \"Powers and Functions of the Tribunal\" provides:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n38.\n\nArbitration Rule 41 \"Preliminary Objections\" provides in pertinent part:\n\n(5) Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\n\n(6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.\n\n**B. The Netherlands-Hungary Bilateral Investment Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nArticle 10 of the Netherlands BIT, provides16:\n\n1) Any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment shall as far as possible be settled by the disputing Parties in an amicable way.\n\n2) If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either Party requested amicable settlement, it shall upon request of either disputing party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. In this case the provisions of paragraphs 3-9 of Article 9 shall be applied *mutatis mutandis....*\n\n3) In case both Contracting Parties have become members of the [ICSID Convention], disputes between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party under the first paragraph of the present Article shall be submitted for settlement by conciliation or arbitration to [ICSID].\n\nAgreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Hungarian People's Republic for the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments dated 2 September 1987 (the \"Netherlands BIT\") (Exh. C-1).\n\n40.\n\nArticle 9(6) provides:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of respect for the law, including particularly the present Agreement and other relevant agreements existing between the two Contracting Parties and the universally acknowledged rules and principles of international law.\n\n41.\n\nArticle 4(1) provides:\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the former Contracting Party may have given;\n\n(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency adopted by the claimants.\n\n**C. The Switzerland-Hungary Bilateral Investment Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nArticle 10 of the Switzerland BIT, which is headed \"Settlement of disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\", provides in relevant part:17\n\n(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without prejudice to Article 9 of this Agreement (Settlement of disputes between Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months, the parties to the dispute may proceed as follows:\n\na) A dispute concerning Article 6 of this Agreement shall upon request of the investor be submitted to [ICSID] instituted by the [ICSID Convention].\n\nb) In the event of a dispute not referred to in paragraph (2), letter a) of this Article the dispute shall be submitted, upon agreement on such submission by both parties to the dispute, to [ICSID].\n\nAgreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Hungarian People's Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 5 October 1988 (the \"Switzerland BIT\") (Exh. C-2).\n\n43.\n\nArticle 6 of the Switzerland BIT, which is headed \"Expropriation and Compensation\", provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments belonging to investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest, on a nondiscriminatory basis, and under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation. (\\_)\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nBy its written submission of 31 August 2012, Respondent asserts that Claimants' Request for Arbitration fails to allege that Hungary consented to submit to ICSID arbitration claims arising under the Netherlands and Switzerland BITs, unrelated to expropriation. It further asserts that Hungary's limited consent to arbitration as provided in the dispute resolution provision of each of the Treaties does not cover any treaty claims beyond expropriation; nor does it cover claims arising independently under customary international law. On this basis, Hungary requests that the Tribunal issue a decision pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) dismissing with prejudice such claims.\n\n45.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the question currently before this Tribunal can be the subject matter of a preliminary objection pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).18 In addition, the applicable legal standard for the determination of such issues is also undisputed. The Respondent asserts that \"to sustain an objection under Rule 41(5) a tribunal has to find that a claim is \u2018without legal merit' and that the lack of legal merit is \u2018manifest.'\"19 This has not been contested by the Claimants.\n\n*See* Rule 41(5) Objection, [7] (stating that \"it is clear that the objection may be either merits-based or jurisdictional.\") Claimants did not contest this point.\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, [6].\n\n46.\n\nRather, Claimants consider that \"Respondent's invocation of Rule 41(5) is unnecessary, and the Tribunal need not consider the merits of the Objection.\"20 Respondent having made plain that it does not consent to inclusion of the non-expropriation claims within the compass of the present arbitration, the Claimants accept that those claims may not be pursued. Accordingly, a formal ruling from the Tribunal is unnecessary.\n\nClaimants' Response, 1.\n\n47.\n\nFollowing the Claimant's filing of its Revised Amended Request, and the further exchange of written pleadings upon it, the scope of matters remaining in dispute between the Parties that require a decision from the Tribunal has been significantly reduced. Accordingly, it is not now necessary to set forth in detail all of the arguments raised by the Parties on the Rule 41(5) Objection prior to the First Session. Rather, the Tribunal proposes to focus its exposition of the pleadings, and its analysis of the issues, on the two outstanding questions:\n\n(1) Whether, in respect of non-expropriation elements of the claim that the parties agree may not be pursued in the present arbitration, the Tribunal ought nevertheless to issue a decision under Rule 41(5);\n\n(2) Whether the Respondent is entitled to relief under Rule 41(5) in respect of the Claimants' claim for breach of the customary international law standard of expropriation.\n\n**A. The Non-Expropriation Claims**\n-----------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nHungary contends that the Request includes three categories of claims. Two of these categories relate to expropriation claims arising under the Treaties. The third category includes \"claims that Hungary breached \u2018other standards' of the same treaties, allegedly \u2018by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment' \u2018by discriminating against the Claimants' and \u2018by failing to observe obligations entered with respect to Claimants.'\" This category *also* includes allegations that Hungary \"has breached customary international law by violating the minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors.\"21 According to Respondent, these latter claims (hereinafter the \"Non-Expropriation Claims\") ought to be dismissed as manifestly without legal merit.\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, [1] (citing the Request for Arbitration at [24], [27], [65], [70] and [72])\n\n49.\n\nFirst, it asserts that \"\\_consent for arbitration by the host State must exist *prior* to the claim being submitted to arbitration. To the extent a request for arbitration fails *even to allege* the existence of such prior consent, it must be dismissed as manifestly without legal merit.\"22 In particular, it alleges that by referring in their Request for Arbitration to a third category of claims [the Non Expropriation Claims] which are \"subject to arbitration in this proceeding with the parties' mutual consent,\" the Claimants have tacitly acknowledged that no advance consent exists to arbitrate those claims, while at the same time including those claims in their request for relief.23 Given that the Request is lacking a required material element, the NonExpropriation Claims must be dismissed.\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, [4]; *see also* [13]-[17]; [37] - [39]; Respondent's Letter dated 20 September 2012, 2.\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, [37] (citing the Request for Arbitration at [24] and [27] and [70]).\n\n50.\n\nSecondly, it alleges that on the face of each of the Treaties, Hungary consented to arbitrate only disputes concerning expropriation. It submits that this construction is supported by arbitral decisions in like cases.24\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, [23] - [30], citing *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 19 June 2006, [216] (RA-25); *Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15, Award of 13 September 2006, [81] and [83] (RA-23); *William Nagel v. Czech Republic,* SCC Case No *.* 049/2002, Final Award of 9 September 2003, [45] and [271] (RA-17); *Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5 *,* Award of 30 June 2009 [121] (RA-20).\n\n51.\n\nRespondent considers that Claimants' Revised Amended Request for Arbitration, is inconsistent with the Tribunal's instruction as set forth in PO No 1 \"as Claimants have chosen to treat it as a license to redraft their pleadings..\"25 \"[I]n any event, they \"fail to remedy the defect to which Hungary presented objections under ICSID Rule 41(5).\" because \"the Revised Request *fails to remove* allegations of breaches of various treaty provisions not relating to expropriation.\"26 The Respondent therefore asks the Tribunal to adopt Hungary's version of the Revised Amended Request for Arbitration.27\n\n*See* Respondent's Letter dated 26 October 2012, 1; Respondent's Letter dated 7 November 2012, 2; Respondent's Letter dated 10 December 2012, 1, (rejecting Claimants' allegations that their acceptance of passages stricken from the Request for Arbitration was only provisional).\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 26 October 2012, 1 -2; *see also* Respondent's Letter dated 7 November 2012, 2.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 26 October 2012, 2 and Annex A; Respondent's Letter dated 7 November 2012, 3; Respondent's Letter dated 10 December 2012, 3.\n\n52.\n\nEven if the principal assertions in the Objection are uncontested by Claimants, \"the Tribunal cannot simply leave a Rule 41(5) Objection unresolved.\" Instead, and consistent with the *Trans-Global Petroleum Inc. v. Jordan* tribunal, a decision is required \"particularly when the Request for Arbitration so clearly requests the Tribunal to resolve issues that are not properly before the Tribunal.\"28\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 20 September 2012 p. 2, citing *Trans-Global Petroleum Inc. v. Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25\u00a0(the tribunal rendering a decision after claimant withdrew a claim in response to respondent's objection under Rule 41(5)), Decision on Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of 12 May 2008 (RA-24) (\" *TransGlobal*); Respondent's Letter dated 26 October 2012, 2.\n\n53.\n\nClaimants consider that \"Respondent's contention that consent must have existed before the filing of the Request for Arbitration is overly formalistic in this context, where Respondent had already consented to submit to arbitration certain claims and was invited to submit to arbitration the remaining claims.\"29 Furthermore, Claimants notified Respondent early on that it was in violation of several non-expropriation obligations which it intended to submit to ICSID arbitration if not resolved. Respondent did not object to arbitrating those nonexpropriation claims and therefore including those Non-Expropriation Claims in this proceeding was consistent with the ICSID Convention and the Treaties.30\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 24 September 2012, 2.\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 24 September 2012, 3.\n\n54.\n\nThey further assert that \"[n]othing prevented Respondent from agreeing to submit to arbitration the non-expropriation claims asserted in the Amended Request for Arbitration and resolve - once and for all - every single claim related to the breach of Respondent's international obligations under the Netherlands Treaty, the Switzerland Treaty as well as customary international law.\"31\n\nClaimants' Response, 2.\n\n55.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Hungary's argument that the lack of consent to arbitration of the Non-Expropriation Claims compels the Tribunal to dismiss them pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) is without merit.32 They reject Respondent's interpretation of the *Trans-Global* decision and consider it inapposite, since in that case the parties had fully briefed and argued the merits of the Rule 41(5) Objection and it was only later that the claimant decided to withdraw one of the three claims, while pursuing the other, \"making it logical for the Tribunal to issue a written award deciding the objections as to all three.\"33\n\nClaimants' Response, 1.\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 24 September 2012, 3.\n\n56.\n\nWith regard to the Revised Amended Request for Arbitration, Claimants consider that the amendments are \"proper and consistent with the Tribunal's instructions\" and that the Revised Request should be acknowledged as the operative Request for Arbitration in these proceedings.34 In particular, in the Revised Request, Claimants \"struck the request for declaratory relief related to Respondent's violation of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.\"35\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 30 October 2012, 1, 3; Claimants' Letter dated 7 November 2012.\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 7 November 2012, 2.\n\n57.\n\nClaimants conclude that while \"Claimants' [N]on-[E]xpropriation claims are meritorious.the Tribunal cannot decide them because Respondent has refused to consent to their arbitration\"36 and \"the Tribunal need not enter an unnecessary order of dismissal of claims under Rule 41(5).\"37\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 24 September 2012, 4; *see also* Claimants' Response, 3.\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 30 October 2012, 3.\n\n**B. The Customary International Law Expropriation Claim**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent alleges that it has not consented to arbitration of claims arising from stand-alone obligations under customary international law, and therefore the customary international law expropriation claim must be dismissed.38 Article 42 of the ICSID Convention does not \"create [an] independent obligation on the part of the host State to act in accordance with customary international law, much less does it provide a source of consent to *arbitrate* such claims before ICSID.\"39 Nor does it \"authorize a tribunal to consider claims for relief that are independent of the treaty terms.\"40\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, [32]-[36].\n\nIbid, [35].\n\nIbid, [35].\n\n59.\n\nAccordingly, \"neither the treaties at issue nor Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention entitles Claimants to assert customary international law *as an independent cause of action*, as Claimants purport to do in their Request for Arbitration.\"41 Respondent further rejects Claimants' alleged assertions that the dispute resolution provision of the Netherlands BIT, should be read as a reference to Article 4 of the Treaty [Expropriation and Nationalization] as well as to disputes under customary international law on expropriation.42 The wording of the Switzerland BIT is even more clear, as it limits the consent to arbitration only to disputes \u2018concerning Article 6' of that Treaty.43\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 10 December 2012, 2 (referring to *Generation Ukraine Inv. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 December 2003, [11.3]).\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 10 December 2012, 2 (referring to Claimants' Letter dated 7 November 2012).\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 10 December 2012, 2; Hungary-Switzerland BIT, Art. 10 (Exh. C-2).\n\n60.\n\nFurther, Respondent contends that Claimants conceded at the First Session that the request for relief based on customary international law should be deleted and should not be allowed to resile from this concession by failing to make such a deletion.44\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 7 November 2012, 2 (referring to audio recording of First Session).\n\n61.\n\nClaimants submit that they \"should not be forced to delete their existing reference to \u2018principles of international law'\" or \"abandon their request in paragraph 72(c) that the Tribunal declare that Respondent has \u2018breached customary international law by expropriating the Claimants' investment.' These are plainly expropriation claims, and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to apply principles of international law and provide the requested relief under the Netherlands-Hungary [BIT] and Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"45\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 30 October 2012, 2; *see also* Claimants' Letter dated 7 November 2012, 1.\n\n62.\n\nClaimants contend that they made no concession on this point at the First Session, always making clear that they would need an opportunity to check and confirm the position in writing.46 In any event, they submit that this issue may not be resolved under the Rule 41(5) procedure as \"manifestly without legal merit\". Rather, it requires consideration at the hearing on the merits, after full argument.47\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 7 November 2012, 2.\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 13 December 2012, 2.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn view of the narrowing of the issues that has been achieved as a result of the discussions and exchanges of pleadings between the Parties, the Tribunal is in a position to limit its consideration to the remaining unresolved questions left for its decision. Accordingly, it proposes to address:\n\n(1) Whether, in the light of the Revised Amended Request, the Respondent is still entitled to a decision on its Rule 41(5) in respect of the Non-Expropriation Claims; and,\n\n(2) Whether the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim is \"manifestly without legal merit\" within the terms of Rule 41(5) and should therefore be dismissed.\n\n**A. The Non-Expropriation Claims**\n-----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nBoth Parties are agreed that, in the absence of consent to the arbitration of additional claims by both parties, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present proceedings is limited to claims of expropriation. The Treaties, as the operative instruments of consent so state in express terms:\n\n(1) The dispute settlement provision in the Netherlands BIT is limited to disputes \"concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment\";48\n\n(2) The dispute settlement provision in the Switzerland BIT is, save where both parties consent, limited to a \"dispute concerning Article 6 of this Agreement\". Article 6 is headed \"Expropriation and Compensation\" and proscribes \"measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments.\"\n\nArt. 10.\n\n65.\n\nThe question remaining for the Tribunal is whether the filing of the Revised Amended Request is sufficient acknowledgement of the point, as Claimants contend, or whether a ruling under Order 41(5) is needed, as Respondent continues to assert.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the Revised Amended Request. Paragraph 13.2 of PO No1 requires Claimants, as they had agreed to do at the First Session, to \"strik[e] through the passages referring to any non-expropriation claims\" that they consider no longer pending before this Tribunal. In a number of paragraphs, this is precisely what Claimants have done. Notably, the revised Request for Relief (reproduced above at [34]) does strike through the nonexpropriation claims.\n\n67.\n\nHowever, in other paragraphs, Claimants have gone beyond the terms of the Tribunal's order in PO No1, by maintaining previous text relating to the non-expropriation claims and supplementing it. For example, the revised text of paragraph 24 as filed by Claimants now reads:\n\n~~This dispute~~The Respondent has also ~~results from~~committed breaches of other standards of the Netherlands treaty described above ~~. which~~but those breaches are not subject to arbitration in this proceeding ~~with the parties' mutual consent~~because Respondent has refused to arbitrate those breaches.\n\nThere are further examples of a similar approach taken in paragraphs 27, 65 and 68.\n\n68.\n\nRespondent submits that this does not comply with PO No1 and that, in the circumstances, it is entitled to a Decision under Rule 41(5) dismissing the Non-expropriation Claims. Further, it requests the Tribunal to adopt Hungary's rival proposal as to the passages to be stricken from the text of the Request for Arbitration.49 Claimants, for their part, contend that \"[t]here is nothing inappropriate or prejudicial in Claimants'... making reference to Respondent's refusal to consent to arbitrate the non-expropriation claims, where such consent was the express premise on which the claims had initially been made\".50\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 26 October 2012.\n\nClaimants' Letter dated 30 October 2012, 1.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that it is part of its function, as arbitrator appointed by the Parties to adjudge their respective claims and defences, to draft either Party's pleadings for them. For this reason, it does not enter upon a reformulation of the Revised Amended Request whether in the terms proposed by Respondent or otherwise.\n\n70.\n\nNevertheless, it does consider that the plain text of the Treaties makes it manifest that, in the absence of other consent, the Non-Expropriation Claims fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Accordingly (and without prejudice to any merit that those claims may have in another forum) they must be treated as \"without legal merit\" for the purpose of these proceedings.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal's overriding duty is to ensure that those claims that are properly within its jurisdiction are determined in accordance with the applicable law and fairly as between the Parties. It considers that the approach presently adopted by Claimants in those paragraphs of its Revised Amended Request referred to in paragraph 67 above falls outside the scope of its jurisdiction and do not contribute to the fair disposition of these proceedings. Such passages go beyond recording Respondent's refusal to arbitrate the non-expropriation claims and contain a positive averment that Respondent has committed other treaty breaches. For the reasons already stated, it is outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to determine whether or not this is so. It follows that Respondent is neither obliged nor entitled to plead to these averments in its Counter-Memorial, and that they cannot be the subject of evidence or submission. They fall outside the scope of these proceedings and cannot therefore form any part of them.\n\n72.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal considers that it is necessary for it to enter a formal dismissal of the non-expropriation claims from these proceedings, pursuant to its powers under Rule 41(5).\n\n**B. The Customary International Law Expropriation Claim**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe position is different as regards the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim. In its present form, this is found in paragraph 72(b) of the Revised Amended Request, which seeks an award \"[d]eclaring that the Respondent has breached customary international law by expropriating the Claimants' investments without observance of due process and payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\" Paragraph 69 adds that: \"[c]ustomary international law is applicable in this case under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n74.\n\nIn its Rule 41(5) Objection, Respondent seeks separately a dismissal of this claim on the ground that it falls outside the instruments of consent, being the arbitration provisions of the Treaties. Respondent also submits that the exclusion of this claim was conceded by Claimants at the First Session.\n\n75.\n\nClaimants contend that such a claim is within the Tribunal's jurisdiction, as the Parties consented to its inclusion in particular by Article 10 of the Netherlands Treaty, which refers simply to disputes \"concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment\".51\n\nClaimants' letter dated 30 October 2012, 2 n3; Claimants' letter dated 7 November 2012, 3 n5.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that, by their statements in the First Session, the Claimants have conceded the excision of this claim. The discussion between the Tribunal and counsel as to the passages in the Request for Arbitration that may be covered by the agreement between the Parties on the Rule 41(5) Objection proceeded expressly on the basis that neither Party would be bound without a further opportunity to review the matter after the hearing and to confirm their position in writing. Moreover, the Tribunal confined the relevant paragraph in PO No1 to a requirement that Claimants file \"an amended Request for Arbitration striking through the passages referring to any non-expropriation claims \" (emphasis added). It made at that stage no specific provision in relation to the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim. It simply permitted the Respondent to renew its Rule 41(5) Objection in the event that \"it maintains any objection that the Amended Request has correctly removed those claims that Claimants have agreed may not be pursued in these proceedings.\"52\n\nPO No 1, [13.3].\n\n77.\n\nThus, the Tribunal regards the question of whether the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim falls within or without its jurisdiction as still being at large in these proceedings. If and only if the Tribunal is satisfied that the invocation of its jurisdiction on this basis is \"manifestly without legal merit\" is it empowered to dismiss it under Rule 41(5).\n\n78.\n\nThe question at this stage is not one of the law applicable to the merits of the proceedings. True it is that the choice of law rule in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention includes reference to \"such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" This means that the Tribunal has to apply international law *as a whole* to the claim, and not the provisions of the BIT in isolation.53 It must in any event construe the applicable primary rules in the Treaties by reference to other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.54 In the case of the Netherlands BIT, this point is made expressly in Article 9(6), which provides:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of respect for the law, including particularly the present Agreement and other relevant agreements existing between the two Contracting Parties and the universally acknowledged rules and principles of international law.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd (\u2018MTD') v Chile* (Decision on Annulment) (2007) 13 ICSID Rep 500, [61].\n\nArt31(3)(c) Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969.\n\n79.\n\nBut what is at issue here is not the determination of the content of the applicable treaty norms in the context of international law as a whole, including customary international law. Rather, the Claimants advance an additional separate cause of action for expropriation under customary international law. This therefore raises a question not of applicable law, but of the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* Such a question is not determined by reference to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, which is solely concerned with the law applicable to the merits of a dispute already properly within the jurisdiction of the Centre.55\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co v Argentina* (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/01/8 (September 25.2007), [68]; *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd v Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction No 2) (1988) 3 ICSID Rep 131; Schreuer *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn, 2009), 550-2.\n\n80.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre is determined by Article 25 of the Convention, which requires \"consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\" In the present case, the only instruments of consent relied upon by Claimants are the dispute settlement provisions in the Treaties, namely Article 10 of the Netherlands BIT and Article 10 of the Switzerland BIT. Each of these constitutes a \"convention to arbitrate\"56 whose existence, scope and construction as an instrument of consent for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is separate from the other obligations in the Treaty in which it is found. Each such instrument of consent is to be construed by the Tribunal in accordance with the general principles of *pacta sunt servanda* and good faith in order to \"find out and to respect the common will of the parties.\"57\n\n*Amco Asia Corp v Indonesia (* Decision on Jurisdiction) (1983) 1 ICSID Rep 394, [14].\n\nIdem\n\n81.\n\nArticle 10 of the Switzerland BIT is, by its terms, limited in the absence of other consent, to \"[a] dispute concerning Article 6 of this Agreement\". Article 6 contains the Treaty stipulation in relation to expropriation. This instrument of consent is therefore not wide enough to encompass a separate claim of breach of the customary international law standard of expropriation, but is limited to the treaty standard (construed in accordance with international law as the applicable law). It follows that the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* has been defined by the Contracting Parties.\n\n82.\n\nHowever, Article 10 of the Netherlands BIT, on which Claimants have specifically relied in their recent submissions, refers generally to \"[a]ny dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment.\" Article 10 is not expressly linked to Article 4(1), which sets forth the treaty standard relating to expropriation. Indeed, Article 4(1) does not use the expression \"expropriation or nationalization\" at all. Instead, it refers functionally to \"measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments\". At this point, the Tribunal does not decide whether the consent to arbitrate \"[a]ny dispute... concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment\" in Article 10 of the Netherlands BIT is necessarily limited to disputes founded upon Article 4(1). Expropriation and nationalization are terms that may also properly refer to the standards of customary international law, where such concepts have been widely considered and applied.\n\n83.\n\nAt this stage in the proceedings, the Tribunal need reach no conclusion as to whether there is any difference in the applicable content of the customary international law standard to that set out in Article 4(1) of the Netherlands BIT. Nor indeed need it take a final decision as to whether Article 10 does, as a matter of construction, embrace both the customary international rules on expropriation and the treaty standard. Despite the opportunities afforded to both Parties to develop their written submissions on the Rule 41(5) Objection, the Tribunal does not consider that this question has as yet been sufficiently briefed to enable it to reach a conclusive determination on the point.\n\n84.\n\nIt is sufficient for present purposes to decide that the Customary International Law Expropriation claim is not \"manifestly without legal merit\" for the purpose of Rule 41(5). It must therefore be allowed to go forward to the hearing on the merits. This finding does not preclude Respondent from maintaining, should it be so advised, an objection to jurisdiction in relation to this claim. But the Tribunal considers that, in view of fact that the Parties are agreed that the treaty expropriation claims are within its jurisdiction, and the close overlap between such claims and the customary international law expropriation claim, any such objection, if made, should be joined to the merits.\n\n**VII.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal set forth the procedural history of this matter from the filing of the Request for Arbitration on 28 October 2011 until 10 March 2013 in its Decision on Respondent's Objection under ICSID Rule 41(5) dated 11 March 2013 (**Rule 41(5) Decision**).\n\n7.\n\nBy paragraph 85 of that Decision (the *dispositif*), the Tribunal decided to:\n\n(1) Grant Respondent's objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to the extent of dismissing all Non-Expropriation Claims from these proceedings as being outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\n(2) Deny Respondent's objection under Rule 41(5) in respect of the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim;\n\n(3) Join any further objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre in respect of the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim, to the extent maintained, to the merits; and,\n\n(4) Grant Claimants 14 days from dispatch of this Decision to the Parties within which to file a further Revised Amended Request reflecting the terms of this Decision.\n\n8.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 85(4), by letter dated 25 March 2013, Claimants requested the Tribunal to treat specified passages in paragraphs [24], [27], [65] and [68] of the Revised Amended Request as stricken. Accordingly, the Tribunal treats the Request for Arbitration in these proceedings as the Revised Amended Request dated 27 December 2012, as further amended by this letter (together **Request for Arbitration**).\n\n9.\n\nFollowing the Rule 41(5) Decision, the Parties further applied, by letters from Claimants dated 14 March 2013 and from Respondent dated 15 March 2013, for further directions as to the procedural calendar and for an oral hearing thereon. Having received written submissions from the Parties, a teleconference hearing was convened before the full Tribunal on 21/22 March 2013. Following that hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No2 (**PO No2**) dated 25 March 2013.\n\n10.\n\nThis Order provided, by way of amendment to paragraph 12.7 of Procedural Order No1 (**PO No1**), for the Respondent to notify the Tribunal and Claimants by 22 May 2013 whether it intended to raise any jurisdictional objections under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) and request a suspension of the proceedings on the merits. In the event that such an application were made, it further provided for Claimants to reply by 5 June 2013 and for the Tribunal to decide the question of bifurcation by 19 June 2013. It then set forth two alternative pleading scenarios depending upon the Tribunal's decision.\n\n11.\n\nOn 24 April 2013 (in accordance with the Tribunal's decisions of 18 April 2013 and 2 May 2013), Claimants filed their Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits and accompanying documents (**Memorial**).\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 April 2013, the Parties agreed certain revisions to the procedural timetable, including extending the time for the Respondent's Request to May 28, 2013. The Tribunal consented to these extensions on 2 May 2013.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Request on 28 May 2013.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants filed its Reply on 5 June 2013.\n\n15.\n\nEach party subsequently wrote to the Tribunal: Respondent by letter dated 6 June 2013 and Claimants by letter dated 10 June 2013.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated by conference call on 10/11 June 2013 and by other means.\n\n**III. RELEVANT LEGAL TEXTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal sets forth below the relevant portions of the legal texts germane to its Decision.\n\n**A. ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which is found within Chapter II headed \"Jurisdiction of the Centre\", provides:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n19.\n\nArticle 41 of the Convention, which is within Chapter IV Section 3 headed \"Powers and Functions of the Tribunal,\" provides:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits.\n\n20.\n\nArbitration Rule 41 \"Preliminary Objections\" provides, in relevant part:\n\n(3) Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the parties may file observations on the objections.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall decide whether or not the further procedures relating to the objection made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be oral. It may deal with the objection as a preliminary objection or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.\n\n**B. The Netherlands-Hungary Bilateral Investment Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Netherlands BIT provides:\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall take any measure depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the former Contracting Party may have given;\n\n(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\n\n22.\n\nArticle 1(1) provides:\n\n[T]he term \"investments\" shall comprise every kind of asset connected with the participation in companies and joint ventures, more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights *in rem* in respect of every kind of asset;\n\n(b) rights derived from shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures;\n\n(c) title to money, goodwill and other assets and to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes and knowhow;\n\n(e) rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources.\n\n**C. The Switzerland-Hungary Bilateral Investment Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the Swiss BIT provides:\n\nNeither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments belonging to investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, and under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation. The amount of compensation, interest included, shall be settled in the currency of the country of origin of the investment and paid without delay to the person entitled thereto, without regard to its residence or domicile.\n\n24.\n\nArticle 1(2) provides:\n\nThe term \"investments\" shall include every kind of assets and particularly:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as servitudes, mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(b) shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in companies;\n\n(c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, utility models, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, indications of origin), know-how and goodwill;\n\n(e) concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' PLEADINGS**\n------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal will now summarise the pleadings of the Parties to the extent relevant and necessary to its Decision.\n\n**A. The Claim**\n----------------\n\n26.\n\nBy their Request for Arbitration (as amended, including as a result of the Tribunal's Rule 41(5) Decision), Claimants allege that Respondent breached the Treaties and customary international law by indirectly expropriating Claimants' investments in a national FM-radio frequency broadcasting licensee, Sl\u00e0ger.1 They allege the Respondent did so by conducting a tender for the radio frequency then held by Sl\u00e0ger in 2009 (**the 2009 Tender**) in an unlawful manner.2\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [1], [5].\n\nIbid, [65], [72].\n\n27.\n\nIn setting forth the claimed basis for ICSID jurisdiction under Article 25 of the Convention, Claimants allege:3\n\nThe Claimants' investments in the stock of Sl\u00e0ger Radio evidenced their interests in the value of the rights conferred by their broadcasting licences. These rights included not only the right to conduct broadcast operations but also the legal protection granted by the Media Law and the regulations or other instruments adopted to implement the Media Law. Those rights and protections included, *inter alia,* the preference that was accorded to existing licensees in competitive tenders in which they sought renewal of their licenses, and a legal framework guaranteeing that tenders would be conducted lawfully and in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nIbid, [19].\n\n28.\n\nClaimants develop these points in their Memorial. They allege:4\n\nHungary's scheme to subvert the legal norms under which Claimants were entitled to renewal of their licence indirectly expropriated Claimants' investments, including the value of their shares in Sl\u00e0ger Radio, related assets (including rights granted by its broadcasting agreement) and operations.\n\nMemorial, [22].\n\n29.\n\nRelying upon the definition of investments contained in the Treaties, Claimants allege that \u2018[p]rincipally those investments comprise their respective shares in Sl\u00e0ger Radio, Claimants' Hungarian subsidiary, and the rights derived from those shares.'5 Claimants particularise the rights derived from the shares as:6\n\n\u2022 The Broadcasting Agreement between Sl\u00e0ger Radio and ORTT7, which is an asset and more particularly (i) comprises rights granted under public law (Netherlands Treaty, Article 1(1)(e)), and (ii) constitutes a concession under public law (Switzerland Treaty, Article 1(2)(e)).\n\n\u2022 The rights, protections and guarantees conferred under the Contract Framework, which include, *inter alia,* the right to broadcast, the right of Sl\u00e0ger as the incumbent bidder to receive a preference or advantage in the tender for the renewal of its broadcasting right; the guarantee that all tenders for the renewal of that broadcasting right shall be conducted according to law in good faith, and on a fair, non-discriminatory, nonpartisan and transparent basis. Those rights, protections and guarantees constitute investments because they are (i) rights granted under public law (Netherlands Treaty, Article 1(1)(e)), and (ii) rights given by law, by contract or by \"decision of the authority in accordance with the law.\" (Switzerland Treaty, Article 1(2)(e)).\n\nIbid, [291].\n\nIbid, [292] footnotes omitted.\n\nORTT, Hungarian acronym for *Orsz\u00e1gos R\u00e1di\u00f3 \u00c9s Telev\u00edzi\u00f3 Test\u00fclet,* is the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Board of Hungary.\n\n30.\n\nThe **Broadcasting Agreement** is defined by Claimants as the Agreement between Sl\u00e0ger and **ORTT** dated 18 November 1997.8 The **Contract Framework** is defined by Claimants as the Broadcasting Agreement incorporating the Media Law and the ORTT's General Terms of Tender (**GTT**).9\n\nIbid, [43], Ex. C-115.\n\nIdem, Ex. CA-4.\n\n31.\n\nIn elaborating their claim of expropriation, Claimants allege:10\n\nThe unlawful measures described above rendered Claimants shares in Sl\u00e0ger worthless. The value of Sl\u00e0ger was intrinsically tied to Respondent's observance of the rights and guarantees provided to Sl\u00e0ger in the Contract Framework and the expectation that Sl\u00e0ger's broadcasting right would be renewed indefinitely as long as Sl\u00e0ger provided good radio broadcasting services, complied with the Contract Framework and offered a reasonable broadcast fee. Respondent's wilful failure to observe these obligations coupled with its effective plot to foreclose any meaningful relief from Hungarian courts annihilated the value of Sl\u00e0ger's shares.\n\nIbid, [346] footnotes omitted.\n\n**B. Respondent's Notice of Jurisdictional Objections**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nBy its Request, Respondent gives notice of its jurisdictional objections and requests bifurcation of the proceedings so that they may be further pleaded and determined by the Tribunal.\n\n33.\n\nIn summary, Respondent submits that Claimants' claim:11\n\n... does not \"aris[e] directly out of\" an investment as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, it largely concerns non-existent rights that fail to meet the definition of \"investment\" under the Treaties and the ICSID Convention. Finally, the asserted rights are not cognizable as vested property rights under Hungarian law and therefore cannot, at the threshold level, be the subject of an expropriation claim, the only claim for which Hungary has consented to arbitration. The dispute is therefore beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction due to the failure to meet the requisite conditions *ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis.*\n\nRespondent's Request, [3].\n\n34.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent submits that:\n\n\u2022 The alleged right of incumbent preference does not exist under Hungarian law. There being no legal right, there can be no investment capable of being expropriated;12 and,\n\n\u2022 The alleged rights of fair treatment or legitimate expectation regarding the 2009 Tender do not constitute an asset or investment capable of being expropriated.13\n\nIbid, [6]-[8].\n\nIbid, [9] - [10].\n\n**C. Claimants' Reply**\n-----------------------\n\n35.\n\nClaimants allege in Reply that Respondent has mischaracterised the nature of the claim, including Claimants' investments. It emphasises that these investments include:\n\n\u2022 Their shares in Sl\u00e0ger;\n\n\u2022 Their contractual rights under the Broadcasting Agreement and its Contractual Framework; and,\n\n\u2022 Their direct rights under the Media Law, the GTT and the 2009 Call for Tenders (together the **2009 Regulatory Framework**).\n\nThey allege that these rights, taken together, would have entitled them to renewal of their licence in 2009, with or without an incumbent advantage.14 Thus, Claimants allege, Respondent's actions in failing to renew their licence, have deprived them of the entire value of their investment.\n\nReply, [23]\n\n**V. ISSUES ON BIFURCATION**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Common Ground**\n--------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Parties advance opposing submissions on the question of bifurcation. Nevertheless, there is a measure of agreement between them as to (a) the approach to be taken to bifurcation; and (b) the law applicable to the determination of Claimants' investments. The Tribunal adopts these points as the starting-point for its analysis.\n\n37.\n\nIn approaching the question of bifurcation, the Parties are agreed that:\n\n(1) The Tribunal has, by virtue of Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41, discretion as to whether to suspend the proceedings on the merits and determine a jurisdictional objection as a preliminary issue or whether to join it to the merits.15\n\n(2) The overarching question is one of procedural efficiency. Factors that may be relevant in this regard include:\n\n(a) Whether the request is substantial or frivolous;\n\n(b) Whether the request, if granted, would lead to a material reduction in the proceedings at the next stage;\n\n(c) Whether bifurcation is impractical in the sense that the issues are too intertwined with the merits.16\n\nRespondent's Request, [13]; Reply, [10].\n\nRespondent's Request, [14]; Reply, [11], in each case citing *Glamis Gold Ltd v United States of America* (UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No2 (revised), 31 May 2005), Ex. RA-33, [12].\n\n38.\n\nAs to the determination of the Claimants' investments, the Parties both proceed on the basis that:\n\n(3) (a) The existence and incidents of the rights acquired by Claimants are to be determined by reference to Hungarian law; and,\n\n(b) The questions whether those rights constitute investments and are of a kind that are capable of giving rise to a claim of compensation for expropriation are governed by international law, including the Treaties and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.17\n\n(4) In pleading as to the existence and incidents of the rights acquired by Claimants, the Parties would both wish to adduce evidence, including expert evidence.18\n\nClaimants' Request for Arbitration, [19], cited *supra* [27]; Memorial, [291] - [292], cited *supra* [29]; Reply, [21], [29]; Respondent's Request, [8].\n\nReply, [31]; Respondent's letter dated 6 June 2013, 3rd para.\n\n**B. Respondent's Request for Bifurcation**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nAgainst this background, Respondent submits that the Tribunal ought to order bifurcation on the following grounds:\n\n\u2022 Respondent's jurisdictional objections are substantial not frivolous.\n\n\u2022 If successful, they would dispose of the whole case. If not, they would significantly \u2018clarify the exact nature of the investment or rights against which Hungary's conduct would need to be assessed in the merits phase.'19\n\n\u2022 There are numerous issues on the merits, the determination of which would be lengthy and costly. These costs could be saved if Hungary were successful on its jurisdictional challenge.\n\n\u2022 The issues are distinct. The jurisdictional phase would focus on whether Claimants had legally cognizable investments and rights capable of expropriation and whether this dispute arises directly out of same. The merits phase would focus on whether Hungary's conduct of the 2009 Tender did amount to expropriation and, if so, what damage was caused to Claimants as a result.\n\n\u2022 There would be no prejudice to Claimants other than delay that could be compensated in costs if Claimants were successful.\n\nRespondent's Request, [17].\n\n**C. Claimants' Reply on Bifurcation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nClaimants oppose bifurcation as causing delay and not procedural efficiency. They submit that:\n\n\u2022 Respondent's proposed jurisdictional objections are \u2018so unfounded in fact and law as to be frivolous';20 Claimants' contractual and legal rights are indisputably investments as are their shares in Sl\u00e0ger; and,\n\nDetermination of the legal issues identified by Respondent would require extensive evidence \u2018regarding the existence of the legal rights at issue and the manner in which they should have been implemented in the context of the 2009 Tender',21 which questions are inextricably intertwined with the merits.\n\nReply, [30].\n\nIbid, [31].\n\n**VI. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Tribunal can now proceed to its analysis of the issue of bifurcation, considering the merits of the Request, including its impact on the fair and efficient conduct of these proceedings as a whole.\n\n42.\n\n*In the first place,* it observes that this case is, following its Rule 41(5) Decision, solely concerned with a claim for compensation for expropriation. To be sure, the *source* of the legal right to claim for expropriation is found in two different bilateral treaties, and the Claimants have also asserted a claim under the customary international law of expropriation (which claim, and any jurisdictional objections thereto, the Tribunal has joined to the merits). These differences notwithstanding, there are no other substantive causes of action over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction.\n\n43.\n\n*In the second place,* the essential consequence of this point is that it is of fundamental importance that the Tribunal identify precisely whether, and if so which investments of Claimants are capable of giving rise to their expropriation claim. This is so because, if Respondent's jurisdiction objection were to be upheld, the consequence would be that the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over the present case as a whole. Both Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the scope of the protection from expropriation found in each of the Treaties are limited to \u2018investments' (in the latter case as therein defined). But the same point is equally valid were the Tribunal to deny Respondent's objection. In that event, the Tribunal would need to determine the nature and incidents of the rights held by Claimants that may be considered as investments capable of enjoying the protection of international law against expropriation before deciding whether Respondent's conduct had in fact caused any such expropriation. This would be so whether the proceedings were bifurcated or joined.\n\n44.\n\n*In the third place,* the existence and nature of any such rights must be determined in the first instance by reference to Hungarian law, before the Tribunal proceeds to decide whether any such rights can constitute investments capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation for the purpose of its jurisdiction under the Treaties and the ICSID Convention. That is the basis upon which Claimants plead their case. Respondent submits the same. The Tribunal agrees.22\n\nAccord: Douglas *International Law of Investment Claims* (2009), Ex. RA-45, 52.\n\n45.\n\n*In the fourth place,* the nature of the claim pleaded by Claimants is that Respondent's conduct of the 2009 Tender resulted in the expropriation of its investment. Respondent does not dispute that Claimants originally made an investment in connection with the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.23 But Claimants advance no claim about Respondent's conduct prior to 2009. Equally, neither party disputes that Claimants retained their rights under the Broadcasting Agreement including the broadcasting licence until 18 November 2009.24 The Claimants' claim turns upon an allegation that they held valuable rights, which in the circumstances entitled them to renewal of their licence after 18 November 2009 \u2018as long as Sl\u00e0ger provided good radio broadcasting services, complied with the Contract Framework and offered a reasonable broadcast fee', which rights were expropriated.25 The Claimants seek compensation for the lost value of their investment in Sl\u00e0ger consequent upon their loss of the licence following the 2009 Tender. It follows that the material time at which the Tribunal must assess the question of the rights and investments held by Claimants is at the conduct of the 2009 Tender immediately prior to 18 November 2009.\n\nRespondent's Request, [11].\n\nIbid, [5]; Reply, [19].\n\nMemorial [346], cited *supra* [31].\n\n46.\n\n*In the fifth place,* the precise nature and incidents of the rights and investments then held by Claimants is distinct from the question as to whether such rights were expropriated by Respondent. The first question is primarily a question of law: both Hungarian law and international law. The second question would involve a close consideration of the factual evidence-both documentary and witness testimony-as to Respondent's conduct of the 2009 Tender. In addition to the merits of the expropriation claim, the Tribunal would also have to determine the quantum of any compensation, if it were to decide that a right to compensation was engaged. These aspects of the matter already occupy a substantial portion of the Memorial and its voluminous supporting documentation, and would have to be the subject of pleading by way of Counter-Memorial and subsequent pleadings, with the possibility also of requests for document production.\n\n47.\n\nIt will be apparent from the foregoing analysis that the Tribunal does not regard the Respondent's objection as frivolous. Rather, it raises a substantial question which requires clarification in the interests of both the parties and the Tribunal.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal has anxiously considered the issue of procedural efficiency. It is not unmindful of the fact that the parties have already agreed to an alternative pleading schedule that would enable determination of both jurisdiction and the merits in February 2014 in the event that all issues were to be joined. An order for bifurcation, with a hearing on jurisdiction in December 2013 will, in the event that Respondent is unsuccessful in its jurisdictional challenge, inevitably lead to a significant delay in any merits hearing.\n\n49.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal must balance that factor against the consideration that, if the Respondent were successful in its jurisdictional challenge, it would dispose of the entire case. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimants' submission that the case must, on any scenario, proceed to the merits on the basis of the indirect expropriation of Claimants' shareholding in Sl\u00e0ger.26 For the reasons developed in paragraph 45 above, the Tribunal regards the issue before it on the case as presented by Claimants as concerned with the nature of the rights held by Claimants in respect of the award of a new broadcasting licence. In evaluating that question, the Tribunal must consider the whole bundle of the Claimants' rights. This includes, but is not limited to, the shareholding. On the basis of this examination, it may then determine whether these rights constitute an investment capable of protection from expropriation.\n\nReply, [7].\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that to defer the determination of that question to the merits phase might lead to confusion and lack of clarity on a fundamental question. Indeed, this very point is made in the Award of the Tribunal in *Generation Ukraine Inc v Ukraine*, a decision cited by Claimants in their submissions.27 In that case, the Tribunal denied Respondent's request to bifurcate.28 At the conjoined hearing, the Tribunal adverted to the fundamental need to identify the existence of proprietary rights giving rise to a claim of expropriation, and the difficulties that it encountered, both as to jurisdiction and the merits, in identifying the legal basis for the claims advanced.29\n\nICSID Case No.ARB/00/9, Award dated 16 September 2003; cited in Reply, [15] n11.\n\nIbid, [4.24].\n\nibid, [8.8]-[8.14], [18.1]-[18.2]\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the practicality of determining the nature of Claimants' rights or investments at a preliminary stage and the risk of overlap or duplication with any subsequent merits phase were Respondent to be unsuccessful. Of course, in one sense, as the treatment of the issues in *Generation Ukraine* illustrates, the question of the nature of the investment can go both to jurisdiction and to the merits. It follows that, in the present case, any determination by the Tribunal as to the question would have to be dispositive on either basis. That is to say:\n\n(a) In the event that the Tribunal were to decide that the Claimants had, at the material time, no rights constituting an investment which could be expropriated (or that the dispute did not arise directly out of such investment), then the Tribunal would be obliged to render an award deciding that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or within its own competence, as required by Arbitration Rule 41(6).\n\n(b) In the event that the Tribunal were to decide that the Claimants had, at the material time, rights which did constitute an investment (and that the present dispute arises directly out of such investment), it would overrule the Respondent's objection and hold that the Centre and the Tribunal do have jurisdiction over the present dispute. In that event, the Tribunal's decision as to the nature and incidents of Claimants' investment would also be final for the purpose of the merits phase of the case.\n\n52.\n\nThis point was well elucidated by Judge Higgins in her Separate Opinion in the International Court of Justice in *Oil Platforms*, when she said:30\n\nWhere the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose application and interpretation is contested, whether it has jurisdiction, that decision must be definitive....It does not suffice, in the making of this definitive decision, for the Court to decide that it has heard claims relating to the various articles that are \"arguable questions\" or that are \"bona fide questions of interpretation\"....\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)* (Preliminary Objection) [1996] ICJ Rep 803, Higgins Separate Opinion, [31].\n\n53.\n\nThe same point was made in the investment arbitration context by the Tribunal in *UPS v Canada* when it held:31\n\n[A]ny ruling about the legal meaning of the jurisdictional provision, for instance about its outer limits, is binding on the parties.\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc v Canada* (Award on Jurisdiction) (2002) 7 ICSID Rep 285, 297.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal will be assisted in reaching such a final determination by the expert evidence as to Hungarian law that both parties propose to adduce.\n\n55.\n\nBut the Tribunal does consider that this issue can and should be separated from the questions of whether Respondent's acts constituted expropriation, and, if so, the consequences of that in terms of compensation.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants will not be prejudiced by bifurcation, other than in the increased costs occasioned by the jurisdiction application and consequent delay in the event that they are successful in opposing it. It is within the discretion of the Tribunal, as Respondent accepts, to compensate Claimants for these costs.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n57.\n\n**Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal hereby decides that:**\n\n**(1) There shall be a preliminary hearing on Respondent's jurisdictional objection, namely as to the questions:**\n\n**(a) What rights, if any, did Claimants have under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect of the renewal of their broadcasting licence for any period after 18 November 2009;**\n\n**(b) To what extent, if at all, did those rights constitute an investment for the purpose of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and an investment capable of giving rise to a** **claim for expropriation within the competence of this Tribunal under the Treaties; and,**\n\n**(c) Does the present dispute arise directly out of such investment for the purpose of Article 25?**\n\n**(2) For this purpose, the pleading and hearing schedule set forth in scenario A** **provided in paragraph 8.12.1 of PO No1 as inserted by PO No2 (and as varied by agreement between the Parties on 28 April 2013) shall apply.**\n\n**(3) All proceedings on the merits shall be suspended pending the hearing and** **decision on this objection.**\n\n**(4) The costs of and occasioned by this application shall be reserved.**"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **GLOSSARY OF DEFINED TERMS** |\n| 1997 CFT | 1997 Call for Tender dated 10 June 1997, (R-10) |\n| 2009 CFT | Call for Tenders for national radio broadcasting rights dated 20 July 2009, (CA-6) |\n| 2009 Regulatory Framework | Media Law, GTT and the 2009 ORTT Call for Tenders |\n| 2009 Tender | The Tender conducted by ORTT in 2009 for the FM frequency radio licence then held by Sl\u00e1ger |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| Bifurcation Decision | The Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation dated 13 June 2013 |\n| Brill I | First Witness Statement of Barbara Brill dated 22 April 2013 |\n| Brill III | Third Witness Statement of Barbara Brill dated 25 November 2013 |\n| Broadcasting Agreement | Agreement between Sl\u00e1ger and ORTT dated 18 November 1997, (C-115) |\n| Broadcasting Right | Right granted to Sl\u00e1ger pursuant to section 2.1 of the Broadcasting Agreement |\n| Contract Framework | Broadcasting Agreement, incorporating the Media Law and GTT (as alleged by Claimants in the Memorial at [43]) |\n| Counter-Memorial | Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 19 September 2013 |\n| Emmis International | Emmis International Holding, B.V., the First Claimant |\n| Emmis Radio | Emmis Radio Operating B.V., the Second Claimant |\n| GTT | General Terms of Tender of ORTT dated 30 August 1996, (CA-4) |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ICSID/the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| Jonscher Report | Expert Report of Dr Charles Jonscher dated 9 August 2013 |\n| Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I | First Expert Report of Dr Judit Kormendy-\u00c9kes and Dr M\u00e1rk Lengyel dated 9 August 2013 |\n| Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II | Second Expert Report of Dr Judit Kormendy-\u00c9kes and Dr M\u00e1rk Lengyel dated 22 October 2013 |\n| Media Law | Act I of 1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting, (CA-3/R-8) |\n| MEM | MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft., the Third Claimant |\n| Memorial | Claimants' Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 24 April 2013 |\n| Memorial on Jurisdiction | Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 9 August 2013 |\n| Moln\u00e1r I | Expert Legal Opinion of Dr P\u00e9ter Moln\u00e1r dated 22 April 2013 |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Moln\u00e1r II | Supplemental Expert Legal Opinion of Dr P\u00e9ter Moln\u00e1r dated 19 September 2013 |\n| Moln\u00e1r III | Second Supplemental Expert Legal Opinion of Dr P\u00e9ter Moln\u00e1r dated 25 November 2013 |\n| Netherlands BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Netherlands and Hungary dated 2 September 1987, (CA-1) |\n| ORTT | *Orsz\u00e1gos R\u00e1di\u00f3 \u00c9s Telev\u00edzi\u00f3 Test\u00fclet*, National Radio and Television Broadcasting Board of Hungary |\n| Parties | Collectively Claimants and Respondent |\n| Request for Arbitration | Revised Amended Request for Arbitration dated 27 December 2011, as further amended by letter from Claimants dated 25 March 2013 |\n| Reply | Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction dated 23 October 2013 |\n| Rejoinder | Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 25 November 2013 |\n| Rule 41(5) Decision | The Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) dated 11 March 2013 |\n| Sl\u00e1ger/Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3 | Sl\u00e0ger R\u00e1di\u00f3 Musorzolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Zrt. |\n| Smulyan II | Second Witness Statement of Jeffrey H.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute is submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID** or **the Centre**) on the basis of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Hungarian People's Republic for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 2 September 1987, which entered into force on 1 June 1988 (the **Netherlands BIT**), the Agreement Between the Swiss Confederation and the Hungarian People's Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 5 October 1988, which entered into force on 16 May 1989 (the **Switzerland BIT** and jointly with the Netherlands BIT, the **Treaties**), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the **ICSID Convention**).\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Emmis International Holding, B.V. (**Emmis International**), Emmis Radio Operating, B.V. (**Emmis Radio**), and MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. (**MEM**). Emmis International and Emmis Radio are both corporations organised and existing under the laws of the Netherlands. MEM is a company organised and existing under the laws of Hungary, controlled by Mr J\u00fcrg Marquard, a Swiss national. These parties will be collectively referred to hereinafter as **Claimants**.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is Hungary and is referred to hereinafter as **Hungary** or **Respondent**.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent will be hereinafter collectively referred to as the **Parties**.\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute relates to the alleged unlawful expropriation by Respondent of Claimants' investments in a national FM-radio frequency broadcasting licencee, Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3 Musorszolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Zrt. (**Sl\u00e1ger** or **Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3**).\n\n6.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the Parties' written submissions and oral presentations, this Award rules on Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and request for dismissal of Claimants' claims pursuant to ICSID Convention Articles 25 and 41, and Rule 41 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (**Arbitration Rules**), on the grounds that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis* to adjudicate the case.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal set forth the procedural history of this matter from the filing of the Request for Arbitration on 28 October 2011 until 10 March 2013 in its Decision on Respondent's Objection under ICSID Rule 41(5) dated 11 March 2013 (**Rule 41(5) Decision**).\n\n8.\n\nBy paragraph 85 of the Rule 41(5) Decision (the *dispositif*), the Tribunal decided, *inter alia*, to:\n\n(1) Grant Respondent's objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to the extent of dismissing all Non-Expropriation Claims from these proceedings as being outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\n(2) Deny Respondent's objection under Rule 41(5) in respect of the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim; and\n\n(3) Join any further objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre in respect of the Customary International Law Expropriation Claim, to the extent maintained, to the merits.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal included the procedural history of this matter between 10 March and 12 June 2013 in its Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation dated 13 June 2013 (**Bifurcation Decision**).\n\n10.\n\nBy paragraph 57 of the Bifurcation Decision (the *dispositif*), the Tribunal decided, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(1) There shall be a preliminary hearing on Respondent's jurisdictional objection, namely as to the questions:\n\n(a) What rights, if any, did Claimants have under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect of the renewal of their broadcasting licence for any period after 18 November 2009;\n\n(b) To what extent, if at all, did those rights constitute an investment for the purpose of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and an investment capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation within the competence of this Tribunal under the Treaties; and,\n\n(c) Does the present dispute arise directly out of such investment for the purpose of Article 25?\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with this Decision, the Tribunal made provision for the Parties to submit written and oral pleadings on these issues. Pursuant to paragraph 57(2) of the Bifurcation Decision, the Tribunal further decided to adopt the procedural calendar set forth under paragraph 12.8.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by Procedural Order No. 2 and the Parties' agreement of 28 April 2013, as adopted by the Tribunal on 1 May 2013.\n\n12.\n\nOn 9 August 2013 (in accordance with the Tribunal's adopted procedural calendar), Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction (**Memorial on Jurisdiction**).\n\n13.\n\nOn 19 September 2013, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial submission on Jurisdiction (**Counter-Memorial**).\n\n14.\n\nOn 23 October 2013, Respondent filed its Reply submission on Jurisdiction (**Reply**).\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 November 2013, Claimants filed their Rejoinder submission on Jurisdiction (**Rejoinder**).\n\n16.\n\nThe Parties agreed that a two-day oral hearing on jurisdiction would suffice. Neither Party indicated a wish to examine or cross-examine witnesses or experts. Accordingly, the hearing was by agreement confined to submissions by counsel and questions from the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction took place at the World Bank from 16 to 17 December 2013, in Washington, DC (the **Hearing**). In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary, present at the Hearing were:\n\nFor Respondent :\n\nMs Jean E. Kalicki Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMr Dmitri Evseev Arnold & Porter (UK) LLP\n\nMs Mallory Silberman\n\nMr Peter Nikitin Mr Bart Wasiak\n\nMr J\u00e1nos Katona Kende, Moln\u00e1r-B\u00edr\u00f3, Katona\n\nFor Claimants :\n\nMr Scott Enright Emmis Communications\n\nMr Paul Fiddick\n\nMr Jeffrey Smulyan\n\nMs Barbara Brill\n\nDr Peter Brase Marquard Media International\n\nMr Michael McNutt\n\nMr Stephen Jagusch Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP\n\nMr Anthony Sinclair\n\nMr Epaminontas Triantafilou\n\nMr Philip Devenish\n\nDr Andras Szecskay Szecskay Attorneys at Law\n\nDr Andr\u00e1s L\u00e1szl\u00f3\n\nDr Gyorgy Wellmann\n\nOther Participant :\n\nMs Harpreet Dhillon Assistant to Mr J Christopher Thomas (present with the consent of the Parties)\n\n18.\n\nDuring the Hearing the Parties confirmed their prior agreement not to examine the witnesses and experts presented by each side. Counsel for Claimants summarised the basis upon which the Parties had reached such agreement as follows:\n\nThe agreement, as recorded in the communication between Counsel, is that no Report of any Expert or Statement of any Fact Witness is to be treated as withdrawn, and the agreement not to cross-examine an Expert or Fact Witness on any point or points is not to be taken by either Counsel or the Tribunal as an admission as to the accuracy or relevance of that point or points, and Counsel retain the right to make submissions to the Tribunal as to the accuracy, credibility, or probative value of any Expert or Fact Witness' evidence.1\n\nT1/14/17 - 15/5.\n\n19.\n\nThe Parties also agreed during the Hearing to introduce two new documents into the record.2\n\nT1/12/11 - 13.\n\n20.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Hearing, the Parties confirmed their agreement with the Tribunal's proposal that post-hearing briefs were not necessary in this case.3 Accordingly, the President declared the evidentiary and submissions phase of the jurisdictional part of these proceedings closed, provided however that the Parties were ordered to provide the agreed English translations of any disputed Hungarian texts by 9am on 18 December 2013 and to submit schedules of costs by 31 January 2014.\n\nT2/486/10 - 487/9.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated in person, including on 17 and 18 December 2013 and by other means of communication.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn the early nineteen-nineties, Hungary began to adopt policies to attract foreign investment, modernise its infrastructure and improve competition in the provision of services. Within this context, on 21 December 1995, Hungary adopted Act I of 1996 radio and television broadcasting (the **Media Law**),4 seeking to attract the expertise, technology and necessary capital to modernise its broadcasting services, while providing for fair and open procedures for the allocation of radio and television airwaves and promoting freedom of the media.5\n\nAct I of 1996 in Radio and Television Broadcasting, 11 February 1996, (CA-3/R-8). Hungary adopted a new Media Law in 2010. According to Act LXXXII of the 2010 Media Law, ORTT has been replaced with a new regulatory agency called the Media Council *. See* Claimants' Memorial, FN 24.\n\nT1/165/17 - 22.\n\n23.\n\nPursuant to the Media Law, Hungary created the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Board (**ORTT**), an administrative body and independent legal entity with oversight power over the tender procedures and in charge of regulating and concluding Television and radio broadcasting agreements in accordance with the Media Law.6 ORTT Members are appointed by the political parties represented in the Parliament. The Chairman is jointly nominated by the President and Prime Minister of Hungary.7\n\nT1/167/13 - 19.\n\nT1/206/4 - 7.\n\n24.\n\nOn 30 August 1996 and pursuant to section 91 of the Media Law, ORTT adopted the General Terms of Tender (the **GTT**), a set of rules \"relating to the contents and the evaluation of the broadcasting contracts\"8 for the tendering of radio and television broadcasting frequencies.\n\nMedia Law, section 91(1); (CA-3/R-8); *see* General Tender Terms of the National Radio and Television Commission, 30 August 1996, (CA-4). The status and significance of the GTT was an issue in dispute between the Parties. The Respondent contended that the GTT is \"a set of general terms and conditions [...] *not* a source of law under the Hungarian legal system, and [cannot] grant any proprietary rights.\" (Memorial on Jurisdiction, [21]). Claimants relied on the evidence of its legal expert, Dr Moln\u00e1r, to suggest that \"the GTT is a body of mandatory rules that provides bidders with substantive rights enforceable by the Hungarian courts.\" (Counter-Memorial, [42]).\n\n25.\n\nOn 10 June 1997, ORTT called a public and competitive tender process for rights to broadcast two nationwide commercial radio FM frequencies, under certain rules and specifications as to the preparation, submission and evaluation of bids, referred to as the 1997 Call for Tender (the **1997 CFT**).9 The 1997 CFT included the text of the broadcasting agreement to be concluded with the winning bidder, and was, in turn, governed by the GTT and the Media Law.\n\n*See* 1997 Call for Tenders, 10 June 1997, (R-10).\n\n26.\n\nSl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3, a Hungarian company 100% owned by Claimants, was the successful bidder of one of the two frequencies.10 On 18 November 1997, Sl\u00e1ger, and ORTT, concluded a broadcasting agreement (the **Broadcasting Agreement**),11 governed by Hungary's Media Law.\n\nSl\u00e1ger's shareholding is divided as follows: Emmis International holds 59.7 percent; Emmis Radio holds 25.3 percent and MEM holds 15 percent. *See* Memorial, [48]. The other national FM frequency was awarded to Danubius Radio, another foreign owned Hungarian company, whose shareholders also instituted separate arbitration proceeding against Hungary before ICSID (*see* Bifurcation Decision, [10]).\n\nRadio Broadcasting Contract between the National Radio and Television Board and Radio Hungaria Broadcasting Company Limited by Shares, 18 November 1997, (C-115).\n\n27.\n\nIn accordance with clause 2.3 of the Broadcasting Agreement, Sl\u00e1ger's licence was \"issued for seven (7) years, subject to the provisions of the [...] Contract.\" This provision also stipulated that \"[f]or the renewal of the Broadcasting License, \u00a7 107 of the Act shall be applicable.\"\n\n28.\n\nPursuant to section 107(1) of the Media Law, \"[b]roadcasting rights for [radio are valid] for maximum seven years, and may be renewed once upon expiry at the broadcaster's request, without inviting a tender, for an additional five years.\"12\n\nMedia Law, section 107, (CA-3/R-8).\n\n29.\n\nSl\u00e1ger's initial seven-year broadcasting licence ending on 18 November 2004,13 was renewed for a five-year term ending on 18 November 2009.14 From 1997 to 2009 Claimants conducted a successful operation and became a recognised national commercial radio station in Hungary.15 Claimants submit that during that time Sl\u00e1ger followed a strict practice of journalist independence and operated without the influence of political partisanship.16\n\n*See* Radio Broadcasting Contract between the National Radio and Television Board and Radio Hungaria Broadcasting Company Limited by Shares, 18 November 1997, (C-115), section 2.3.\n\n*See* Composition Agreement between the National Radio and Television Commission and Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3, 5 December 2002, (C-117).\n\n*See* Memorial, [68] - [72]; *see also* T1/175/7 - 176/21; First Witness Statement of Barbara Brill dated 22 April 2013, (**Brill I**), [7].\n\nT1/176.\n\n30.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that Sl\u00e1ger enjoyed the full twelve-year term of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.17 Nevertheless, the relationship between the Parties was not without incident.\n\n*See* Memorial, [68] - [72].\n\n31.\n\nOn 5 December 2001, representatives of Emmis met with ORTT representatives on behalf of Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3, seeking a renegotiation of the broadcasting agreement with a view to lowering fees and rescheduling payments.18\n\n*See* Power Point Presentation by Emmis to ORTT, 5 December 2001, (R-22).\n\n32.\n\nOn 20 December 2001, citing unlawful actions and infringements of the Broadcasting Agreement for failure to pay the corresponding portion of the broadcasting fee, ORTT resolved to terminate the Sl\u00e1ger Broadcasting Agreement with immediate effect.19 Sl\u00e1ger challenged the resolution and commenced local legal proceedings. On 5 December 2002, the ORTT and Sl\u00e1ger entered into a settlement agreement and Sl\u00e1ger continued broadcasting pursuant to the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.20\n\n*See* ORTT Decision No. 1787/2001 (XII.20.), 20 December 2001, (R-24).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [42] - [43]. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, Sl\u00e1ger would comply with the original broadcasting fee terms for the remainder of the 7-year term, in exchange for the undertaking that ORTT will extend its licence otherwise set to expire in 2004 for an additional 5 years and a lower fee will be applicable in that latter period. *See* Composition Agreement between the National Radio and Television Commission and Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3, 5 December 2002, (C-117). *See also* 2002 Sl\u00e1ger Annual Report and Supplementary Index, (R-26).\n\n33.\n\nSl\u00e1ger and ORTT entered into further settlements agreements in 2005 and 2007 to resolve disputes between Sl\u00e1ger and ORTT relating to fines ORTT had levied against it for infringements of its broadcasting obligations.21\n\nS *ee* 2005 Settlement Agreement, 7 December 2005, (R-36); 2007 Settlement Agreement, 15 September 2007, (R-41).\n\n34.\n\nOn 1 November 2008, a bill was introduced in Hungary's Parliament, to amend the \"single renewal\" rule of section 107 of the Media Law, to permit further renewals without a tender of the two national analogue broadcasting licences expiring in 2009.22 The amendment sought to extend the licences for additional five-year periods until the completion of a switchover of analog radio spectrums to digital radio broadcasting which had been provided for by Parliament in 2007.23 Claimants had lodged submissions with the Parliamentary Media Committee in September 2008 supporting this amendment.24 However, the President of Hungary refused to sign the bill into law and sent it to the Constitutional Court for review, which declared it unconstitutional.25\n\nSee Bill T/6829 On the Amendment of Act I of 1996 on Radio and television broadcasting, November 2008, (C-199).\n\n*See* Act LXXIV of 2007 on Digital Switchover, 1 June 2007, (R-40).\n\nLetter dated 10 September 2008, (C-266).\n\n*See* Constitutional Court Decision No. 71/2009, AB, July 2009, (CA-102/R-50); *see also* Memorial on Jurisdiction, [54] - [55]; Counter-Memorial, [25].\n\n35.\n\nAccordingly, on 20 July 2009, ORTT conducted a call for tenders to award broadcasting rights over two national FM frequencies, one of which was held by Sl\u00e1ger, the other one by Danubius Radio (the **2009 CFT**).26 Both Sl\u00e1ger and Danubius submitted bids, but lost to other contenders.27\n\nCall for Tenders for national radio broadcasting rights, 20 July 2009, (CA-6).\n\nMemorial, [145].\n\n36.\n\nClaimants submit that the 2009 tender process was \"highly irregular\" and \"unlawful\".28 In particular, they claim that, among other irregularities, the prevailing bidders (i) had prohibited conflicts of interest that should have disqualified their bids, including the bids submitted by FM1 Consortium and Danubius;29 (ii) unfeasible business plans, offering a \"patently unreasonable broadcast fee proposal,\" that was lowered once the tender process ended,30 and (iii) no national broadcasting experience, as the prevailing bidders, Advenio and FM1 Consortium, did not exist until just before the bids were due.31\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [45]-[53]; Memorial, [6] - [18].\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [48]; Memorial, [14], [17] - [18].\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [46]-[47]; Memorial, [15] - [16], [99] - [100].\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [49]; Memorial, [11], [94] - [95].\n\n37.\n\nClaimants also argue that the tender process was tainted by political partisanship. The Government at the time was led by the Socialist Party (MSZP), but its influence was waning in advance of the 2010 elections following which, Hungary's Conservative Party (Fidesz) in coalition with the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), secured a majority in Parliament and became the Government.32 In 2009, the ORTT was composed of a Chairman (jointly nominated by the President and the Prime Minister), and 5 members: two nominated by the MSZP Socialist Party, two nominated by Fidesz Party, and its ally, KDNP, and one by the SZDSZ (the Liberal (Alliance of Free Democrats) Party).33\n\nMemorial, [9], [74].\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [44]; Memorial, [77].\n\n38.\n\nDuring the period in which the tender was conducted, the Hungarian press reported that the leading MSZP and opposition Fidesz were collaborating to use their influence over ORTT to replace Sl\u00e1ger and Danubius, with new operators, loyal supporters of the two parties.34 On this basis, among others, Claimants argue that the Members of ORTT who had been nominated by the two main parties, \"acted in concert [\u2026] to deliver the two national frequencies to new, politically-connected Hungarian bidders,\"35 and suggested that the MSZP and the Fidesz had reached a \"secret backroom political \u2018deal' to split the national radio frequencies.\"36 The Hungarian press also reported that both Sl\u00e1ger and Danubius received warnings that they should reach accommodations with the two leading parties to have a chance of renewing their broadcasting rights.37\n\n*Danubius and Sl\u00e1ger Could Disappear*, N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g, 30 September 2009, (C-16); *Radio: the excluded company wants to sue,* Vil\u00e1ggazdas\u00e1g, 9 October 2009, (C-17); *Danubius and Sl\u00e1ger Under Siege,* N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g, 17 October 2009, (C-18); Request for Arbitration, [45]; Memorial, [97] - [98].\n\nMemorial, [10] *, see also* Memorial [75] - [77].\n\nMemorial, [78], citing to Brill I, [19]; Witness Statement of Paul W.

In addition, the Law permits the Media Council (the new regulatory agency that replaced ORTT) to reduce the broadcast fees that were unrealistically high. On this basis, according to the Claimants, neither the FM1 nor the Advenio contract could be terminated. Moreover, the Media Council has the discretion to lower the high broadcast fees that the winning bidders had included in their bids, if it wishes to do so.52\n\nMemorial, [118] - [121].\n\nRequest for Arbitration [58]; Memorial, [121].\n\n44.\n\nThe enactment of the Media Law raised concerns among the organs of the European Union (the European Commission53 and the European Parliament54) the Council of Europe55 and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,56 over the effects of the Law on the independence of the media and freedom of expression.\n\nLetter from Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission, to Tibor Navracsics, Deputy Prime Minister, 21 January 2011, (C-31).\n\nEuropean Parliament, Resolution P7\\_TA-PROV (2011) 0094, Media Law in Hungary, (C-38).\n\nCouncil of Europe - Commissioner for Human Rights, O *pinion of the Commissioner for Human Rights on* *Hungary's media legislation in light of Council of Europe standards on freedom of the media*, 25 February 2011, (C-33).\n\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Representative on Freedom of the Media, *Hungarian media legislation severely contradicts international standards of media freedom, says OSCE media freedom representative*, 7 September 2010, (C-34).\n\n**IV. PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's Bifurcation Decision, the Parties structured their submissions in order to address two issues central to the scope of the jurisdiction vouchsafed to the Tribunal by the states under the Treaties, namely:57\n\n(a) What rights, if any, did Claimants have under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect of the renewal of their broadcasting licence for any period after 18 November 2009;\n\n(b) To what extent, if at all, did those rights constitute an investment for the purpose of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and an investment capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation within the competence of this Tribunal under the Treaties; does the present dispute arise directly out of such investment for the purpose of Article 25?\n\nBifurcation Decision, [57(1)].\n\n46.\n\nIn summary, Respondent's case is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the present dispute because \"only rights that are proprietary are capable of expropriation\"58 and \"Claimants have failed to demonstrate the existence of proprietary rights capable of expropriation or a dispute arising directly out of an investment in relation to the 2009 tender.\"59\n\nT1/25/16 - 18; *see also* T1/26/2 - 8.\n\nReply, [9].\n\n47.\n\nIn response, Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction because:\n\nIt is undisputed that the Claimants jointly hold 100 percent of the shares in Sl\u00e1ger, and those shares are \"assets\" that qualify as a covered \"investment\" under both applicable BITs and the ICSID Convention. Alternatively, the Claimants' investment is their interest in Sl\u00e1ger as a business operation, comprising all of its value, including their indirect interest in the legal rights and assets held by Sl\u00e1ger under Hungarian law, the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and 2009 Regulatory Framework. Viewed in this sense too, Sl\u00e1ger (and its rights) is a covered \"investment\" under the Treaties and the ICSID Convention.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants' investment was capable of giving rise to an expropriation claim under the Treaties. It is well-established as a matter of international law that indirect expropriation may affect a broad range of intangible assets with economic value, including *inter alia* shares in a company, and tangible and intangible rights held by an investment vehicle.60\n\n[\u2026] Hungary's actions had a direct bearing on the value of the Claimants' shareholding investment [and in their interest in Sl\u00e1ger as an enterprise or business operation]. The dispute therefore arises directly out of the Claimants' investment that was impacted by Hungary's measures.61\n\nRejoinder, [12], [13].\n\nRejoinder, [16].\n\n**A. Claimants' rights under Hungarian Law**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Parties are agreed that the nature of any rights that might form the basis of Claimants' expropriation claim are to be determined under Hungarian law.62\n\nBifurcation Decision, [38(3)(a)].\n\n49.\n\nIn its Bifurcation Decision, the Tribunal defined the material time at which it should assess this question:\n\n[\u2026] Claimants advance no claim about Respondent's conduct prior to 2009. Equally, neither party disputes that Claimants retained their rights under the Broadcasting Agreement including the broadcasting licence until 18 November 2009. The Claimants' claim turns upon an allegation that they held valuable rights, which in the circumstances entitled them to renewal of their licence after 18 November 2009 \u2018as long as Sl\u00e1ger provided good radio broadcasting services, complied with the Contract Framework and offered a reasonable broadcast fee', which rights were expropriated. The Claimants seek compensation for the lost value of their investment in Sl\u00e1ger consequent upon their loss of the licence following the 2009 Tender. It follows that the material time at which the Tribunal must assess the question of the rights and investments held by Claimants is at the conduct of the 2009 Tender immediately prior to 18 November 2009.63\n\nBifurcation Decision, [45].\n\n50.\n\nThe Parties exchanged extensive submissions on the question of the rights and investments held or allegedly held by Claimants, both, (a) arising generally from the 2009 Tender and (b) arising from the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, including the right to an incumbent advantage applicable during the 2009 Tender and an entitlement to the renewal of the licence after 18 November 2009. Both questions were further elaborated in oral pleading. The Parties' submissions on each of these issues are summarised in turn.\n\n***1. General rights in the 2009 Tender***\n------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal had requested that the Parties address during the jurisdictional phase the question of \"[the] rights, if any, [that] Claimants ha[d] under Hungarian Law in 2009 in respect of the renewal of their broadcasting licence [\u2026].\"64\n\nBifurcation Decision, [57(1)(a)].\n\n52.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement (in effect through the 2009 Tender) incorporated by reference several legal rights held by Sl\u00e1ger under the Media Law (in particular Chapters II and VI) and the GTT, which rights collectively constitute the **Contract Framework**.65 Further, Claimants allege that the Media Law, the GTT and the 2009 Call for Tender, operated together to confer valid and enforceable rights on Sl\u00e1ger, which rights collectively constitute what Claimants referred to as the **Regulatory Framework**. While noting that there is a considerable overlap between Sl\u00e1ger's rights under the Contract and the Regulatory Frameworks, the Claimants consider that the aforementioned frameworks constitute the legal sources of:\n\n[\u2026] several important rights in law and contract, including the right to a fairly and transparently established tender process, the right for its bid to be evaluated properly and in accordance with applicable law, and the right not to have to compete against bidders who should have been disqualified based on the rules applicable to the tender.66\n\nCounter-Memorial, [79] - [80], [84].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [22]; *see also* [120] - [133].\n\n*(a)*  *Respondent's submission*\n--------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nRespondent submits that \"neither the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement nor Hungarian Law gave Sl\u00e1ger a proprietary right in relation to the 2009 Tender.\"67 According to Respondent, \"all Sl\u00e1ger had in the fall of 2009 was an expiring broadcasting agreement, which gave no advantages or guarantees in relation to the 2009 Tender.\"68 More specifically:\n\n[\u2026] [C]laimants' claims to other \"legal and contractual rights\" under Hungarian law are either entirely spurious, or amount to simple allegations that ORTT breached general Hungarian rules and regulations governing tenders, which apply equally to all bidders and which, even if violated, cannot lead to a *losing* bidder being awarded the broadcasting right. Such \"rights\" are in no way linked to Sl\u00e1ger's status as an incumbent broadcaster, nor are they otherwise exclusive or personal to Sl\u00e1ger in a manner that would warrant protection as property as a matter of Hungarian law.69\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [69.a]; Reply, [84] - [89].\n\nReply, [54].\n\nReply, [54].\n\n54.\n\nHungary rejects the proposition that a particular Contract Framework applicable to Sl\u00e1ger exists or existed.70 Contrary to Claimants' submission, Respondent asserts that neither the Media Law, nor the GTT can be converted into contractual obligations by virtue of being allegedly incorporated by reference through the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.71 In particular, Respondent challenges Claimants' reading of section 3.2 of the Broadcasting Agreement,72 explaining that (a) this provision refers exclusively to obligations of the \u2018broadcaster,' as does the rest of section 3 of the Broadcasting Agreement and (b) in any case, such provision cannot transform the Media Law into contractual obligations.73\n\nT1/58/5 - 9.\n\nT1/32/10 - 14.\n\nSection 3.2 of the Broadcasting Agreement reads: \"The Broadcaster undertakes to observe the provisions of the Act. The parties hereby incorporate into the present Contract the provisions of the Act relating to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise in effect at the time of the conclusion of the Contract. The Broadcaster hereby expressly agrees to use the Broadcasting Right during the full term of its validity in accordance with the provisions of the Act incorporated into the Contract, whether they are repeated herein or not.\"\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [76]; *see also* T2/346/3 - 7; 348/19. In response to a question from the President, Respondent further explained in oral pleading that the Broadcasting Agreement contained references to the GTT, even if the Tender terms had no real relevance at that point, for historical purposes, (T1/117/18).\n\n55.\n\nRespondent argues that general provisions of law, such as the Media Law and the GTT, cannot be the source of personal obligations owed to Sl\u00e1ger: neither can they be converted into immutable contractual obligations that come into existence after every tender;74 nor can they protect the beneficiary of a broadcasting agreement from later amendments of the GTT, guaranteeing its application at the time the Contract is concluded.\"75\n\nReply, [68]; T1/32/17 - 21.\n\nReply, [70]; T1/121/3 - 15.\n\n56.\n\nRelying on the Report of its experts on Hungarian law, Drs Kormendy-\u00c9kes and Lengyel, Respondent posits that the GTT was a \"set of guidelines\"76 and the primary purpose of the GTT \"was to serve as a set of general terms and conditions applicable to tender participants.\"77 Respondent recognises that \"the GTT was binding and enforceable with respect to the tendering authority and the bidders in any particular tender.\"78 The GTT, however, \"was *not* a source of law under the Hungarian legal system, and could not grant any proprietary rights.\"79 Respondent cites to Drs Kormendy-\u00c9kes and Lengyel to explain that:\n\n[T]o warrant protection under Hungarian law of property, a right must trace its origins to statutory law, have some kind of recognizable financial value, be vested in the entitled person, and be capable of entry as an asset on company accounts. [\u2026] The rights Claimants assert - to the extent they even exist - fail to satisfy these minimum requirements.80\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [120].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [21].\n\nReply, [85].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [21] [Emphasis in original].\n\nReply, [86] - [87], citing to First Expert Report of Dr Judit Kormendy-\u00c9kes and Dr M\u00e1rk Lengyel dated 9 August 2013, (**Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I**), [89], [91], [98], [102], and Second Expert Report of Dr Judit Kormendy-\u00c9kes and Dr M\u00e1rk Lengyel dated 22 October 2013, (**Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II**), [12], [25], [80], [84], [87], [90].\n\n57.\n\nIn conclusion, relying on its legal and economic experts, Hungary submits that even if Hungarian law recognises both traditional property rights and \"rights representing assets\" capable of being owned and alienated, \"none of the rights asserted by Claimants in relation to the 2009 Tender qualify as proprietary rights\"81 as these rights are not \"personal rights,\"82 nor do they \"distinguish Claimants from other bidders.\"83 It explains:\n\nTo the extent Sl\u00e1ger could assert enforceable rights under the GTT or generally applicable provisions of Hungarian law, these rights were merely procedural in nature. These \"due process\" protections extended to Sl\u00e1ger for the simple reason that it chose to participate in the 2009 Tender. They did *not* extend to Sl\u00e1ger because Sl\u00e1ger was the incumbent broadcaster, because Sl\u00e1ger had a contractual entitlement to those rights, or because Sl\u00e1ger had made investments in connection with its operations under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement. In other words, none of the asserted rights arose as a result of Sl\u00e1ger's broadcasting operations in Hungary or qualified as Sl\u00e1ger's property under Hungarian law.84\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [83].\n\nT1/112/21 - 22.\n\nT1/112/8 - 10.\n\nReply, [89], citing **Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II**, [88] - [90].\n\n*(b)*  *Claimants' submission*\n------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nIn summary, Claimants submit that as party of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and under the 2009 Regulatory Framework, as a duly registered bidder, Sl\u00e1ger enjoyed the following set of rights:\n\n\u25a0 the right to an incumbent advantage;\n\n\u25a0 the right to a properly established tender procedure;\n\n\u25a0 the right to a timely tender;\n\n\u25a0 the right to a fair and objective tender evaluation in accordance with transparent scoring criteria;\n\n\u25a0 the right not to compete against unqualified or improperly qualified bidders; and\n\n\u25a0 consequent upon the [appropriate] application of the preceding rights, the right to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.85\n\nRejoinder, [8]. *See also* Rejoinder, [66] - [109].\n\n59.\n\nAccording to Claimants, these are substantive as opposed to procedural rights, which can be the subject of evaluation by the Hungarian Courts, and which were grounded on a sound policy basis: (a) to provide adequate safeguards and benefits for a lawfully operating entity that made profitable investments in Hungary, and (b) to protect against arbitrary or underhanded behaviour on the part of ORTT.86\n\nT1/233/7 - 234/7.\n\n60.\n\n*First*, regarding the bundle of rights arising from the *Contract Framework*, it is Claimants' position that:\n\n[...] certain key provisions of the Media Law were incorporated as terms into the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, including those governing the re-tendering of the broadcasting right granted in the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, and the conclusion of a new Broadcasting Agreement at the end of such re-tendering.\n\nBy virtue of that incorporation, the duties and obligations of the ORTT under the relevant provisions of the Media Law and the GTT indeed became contractual undertakings of the ORTT vis-\u00e0-vis Sl\u00e1ger.87\n\nClaimants submit that \"the legal effect of this incorporation is stabilization.\"88\n\nCounter-Memorial, [86], [87]; *see also* T2/399/8 - 14, confirming that Clause 3.2. of the Broadcasting Agreement \"affects an incorporation of the applicable sections of the Media Act including Chapters 2 and 6, which relates to the Broadcasting Rights and its exercise.\"\n\nT2/399/19 - 20.\n\n61.\n\nClaimants in addition state that the GTT, although not a legislative rule, is a body of mandatory rules that functions as a source of law in the Hungarian legal system.89 It is \"[binding on] the issuer and the tender and the bidders identically;\"90 and applies to all aspects of the 2009 Tender.91 Pursuant to the Broadcasting Agreement, the GTT forms part of the content of the Broadcasting Agreement.92 Relying on Dr Moln\u00e1r's report, Claimants further allege that the GTT provides bidders with substantive rights enforceable by the Hungarian courts.93\n\nCounter-Memorial, [77].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [75].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [71].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [90] - [93].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [42], [44].\n\n62.\n\n*Second*, regarding the bundle of rights arising from the *Regulatory Framework*, Claimants contend that \"as a legitimate participant in the 2009 Tender having paid its tender fee and submitted a compliant bid, Sl\u00e1ger was entitled to benefit from the full panoply of rights conferred upon it by these instruments.\"94\n\nCounter-Memorial, [95].\n\n63.\n\nBased on the preceding arguments, Claimants conclude that \"but for Hungary's breach of Sl\u00e1ger's right during the 2009 Tender, Sl\u00e1ger would have been awarded the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.\"95\n\nRejoinder, [64], [112]; T1/232/4 - 7.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine the Parties' specific submissions *first* as to an alleged incumbent advantage in the tender process; and *second* as to other bases on which Claimants' alleged a right to award of the 2009 broadcasting licence.\n\n***2. Incumbent Advantage***\n----------------------------\n\n65.\n\nClaimants posit that:\n\n[A]s operator of the tendered frequency for 12 years in accordance with its 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and applicable law, Sl\u00e1ger held the right to an incumbent advantage, namely an added benefit in the evaluation of its bid that, combined with a reasonable broadcasting fee offer and fulfillment of the other tender requirements, offered Sl\u00e1ger increased chances of winning the 2009 Tender.96\n\nCounter-Memorial, [23].\n\n66.\n\nClaimants rely upon section 65.3 of the GTT as providing the legal basis for such a right. This provision reads:\n\n65.3.1 That bidder is advantaged, who has held a broadcasting right awarded in tender for the frequency forming the subject-matter of the call for tender, if it operates and broadcasts in accordance with its studio license and the Media Act.\n\n65.3.2 ORTT evaluates at a disadvantage the bidder who holds the broadcasting right for the frequency forming subject of the call for tenders but its operations are not in compliance with its studio license and the Media Act.\n\n*(a)*  *Respondent's submission*\n--------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAccording to Respondent, neither the Contract Framework nor the Regulatory Framework gave Claimants the alleged incumbent advantage.97 On the contrary, Respondent submits that \"suggesting entitlement to an \u2018incumbent advantage' that would essentially guarantee of continued operation, would be clearly unconstitutional, contrary to the principle of competition, and contrary to the very notion of a competitive tender.\"98\n\nT1/33/2 - 6.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [82], [121].\n\n68.\n\nIn addition, relying on the Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel Reports, Respondent contends that section 65.3.1 is not applicable to Sl\u00e1ger since this provision only applied to bidders who held indefinite \"studio licenses,\" a specific form of broadcasting right pre-dating the Media Law, never held by Sl\u00e1ger:\n\nAs explained by Drs. Kormendy-\u00c9kes and Lengyel, Section 65.3.1 explicitly applied only to bidders who held \"studio licenses\". [...] Under Section 146 of the 1996 Media Law, \"studio licenses\" were abolished by the new law, but prior holders of \"studio licenses\" issued for an indefinite term were granted a certain advantage in the tenders for broadcasting rights related to the frequencies. All local and regional tenders cited by Claimants' expert Dr. Moln\u00e1r as providing some points (usually ten) for \"lawful operation\" on the frequency involved frequencies on which there had been an incumbent broadcaster with a \"studio license.\" Since Sl\u00e1ger never held a \"studio license,\" Section 65.3.1 GTT was not applicable to it.99\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction,[78]; *see also* Reply [76]. According to Respondent, section 65.3.2 applied only to holders of indefinite studio licences, whereas holders of Studio licences issued for a fixed term should have transformed their studio licences into Broadcasting Contracts by March 1996, or have their right forfeit under section 146(1) of the Media Law, (T1/88/6 - 21).\n\n69.\n\nMoreover, according to Hungary, even under Claimants' interpretation of section 65.3, Sl\u00e1ger would not have been entitled to the incumbent advantage due to its repeated and severe breaches of its 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and the Media Law.100 In fact, Sl\u00e1ger would have fallen under section 65.3.2, which imposes a \"disadvantage\" on an incumbent bidder that failed to operate in accordance with its licence or the Media Law. Since Sl\u00e1ger's infringement of the Media Law were both \u2018repeated' and \u2018serious', they would have been sufficient to justify an incumbent disadvantage.101 Respondent concedes that \"ORTT did not have any dedicated discussion to determine whether or not Sl\u00e1ger's breaches were serious and repeated\"102 but explains that this was because ORTT did not seek to apply a preference or a dis-preference to an incumbent in the 2009 Tender.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [80]. Respondent contends that between 2002 and 2007, Sl\u00e1ger committed 1822 infringements of its broadcasting obligations, and many penalties were imposed in connection with these violations.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [80]; Reply, [82].\n\nT2/361/11 - 21. *See also* T2/403/8 - 12; ORTT Minutes January - December 2008, (C-197) and ORTT Minutes January - December 2009, (C-198).\n\n70.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Claimants' argument that Hungary's renewal of the licence in 2004 and its decision to conclude a settlement agreement in 2005, according to which ORTT would agree to refrain imposing new sanctions confirms that Claimants' licence acted in accordance with the Media Law.103 The settlement agreement merely reflected a decision not to impose further administrative sanctions for the wrongful conduct, but not that such conduct was proper.104\n\nReply, [83].\n\nT2/363/12 - 370/20.\n\n71.\n\nFinally, Respondent posits that even if Sl\u00e1ger were entitled to benefit from section 65.3.1 of the GTT, the incumbent advantage would not have been sufficient to guarantee the allocation of the new licence to Sl\u00e1ger, since its bid was not competitive and it fell short of winning the bid by 25 points.105 In any case, \"the application of this provision was not sufficiently definite to constitute a right\" on its own.106 If, as Claimants contend, all other bidders should have been disqualified and Sl\u00e1ger should have won as the only qualified bidder, then the incumbent advantage would have been irrelevant for the alleged right to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement to vest in Claimants.107\n\nT1/45/5 - 10; 111/6 - 7; T2/319/18 - 22.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [81].\n\nT2/320/2 - 321/10.\n\n*(b)*  *Claimants' submission*\n------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nClaimants submit that section 65.3.1 of the GTT establishes the right of an incumbent to have an advantage in a new tender of the frequency that it has lawfully operated.108 They further assert that the provision \"gives rise to a right to be advantaged,\" that \"cannot be assigned [...] as such, individually\", but the advantage \"accrues to the incumbent\" and therefore it could have a \"tangible economic value\", that could be valued through either a \"commercial assessment\" (looking at market conditions, identifying comparable transactions and the percentage of points accorded at the issuance of the tender rules) or by simply looking at the points awarded.109\n\nMemorial, [150].\n\nT2/404/2 - 405/10.\n\n73.\n\nNevertheless, Claimants concede that section 65.3.1 of the GTT does not grant a \"decisive\" advantage to the incumbent.110 As explained by Dr Molnar:\n\nThe incumbent advantage does not exclude automatically any bidder from winning a tender. If the incumbent fails to provide a competitive bid, its advantage will not save it from losing its broadcasting right.111\n\nSince Claimants also allege a right to have non-qualifying bidders excluded, Claimants accept the fact that \"the incumbent advantage, in fact has no relevance [\u2026] because there is no other qualifying bidder against which the incumbent needs to be advantaged.\"112\n\nCounter-Memorial, [46]; Rejoinder, [68] - [73].\n\nSupplemental Expert Legal Opinion of Dr P\u00e9ter Moln\u00e1r dated 19 September 2013, (**Moln\u00e1r II**), [61]; Counter-Memorial, [46].\n\nT2/418/2 - 10.\n\n74.\n\nClaimants contend that the references to studio licences in section 65.3 are in fact, \"a remnant from the early days of the 1996 Media Law,\"113 and have in practice been applied by ORTT to all types of broadcasting agreement since \"before the 1996 Media Law was enacted, Hungarian broadcasters operated on the basis of so-called studio licenses, these being precursors to the broadcasting agreements.\"114\n\nCounter-Memorial, [109]; *see also* T1/243/15 - 16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [107], citing Moln\u00e1r II, [39] - [45]; T1/243/3 - 9.\n\n75.\n\nClaimants agree that section 65.3.2 provides a corollary rule that handicaps an incumbent that acted unlawfully.115 They however disagree that Sl\u00e1ger had committed \"serious or repeated\" breaches such that ORTT would have been entitled to apply the incumbent disadvantage to Sl\u00e1ger.116 Claimants explain that \"[u]nder the sanction system created by Section 112 of the 1996 Media Law, combined with well-established ORTT practice, violations would not be considered as \u2018serious' unless they were notified to the broadcaster pursuant to Section 112(1)(b) of the Media Law.\"117 Since Sl\u00e1ger never received such notices, Claimants contend that even if \"it is true that Sl\u00e1ger was found to have committed minor infractions\" considered \"routine\",118 \"[t]here is no evidence that the ORTT considered Sl\u00e1ger as having committed \u2018serious and repeated' violations in evaluating Sl\u00e1ger's bid during the 2009 Tender.\"119 According to Claimants, both when Sl\u00e1ger's broadcasting right was renewed without a tender in 2004, and subsequently, after the Parties concluded settlement agreements in 2005 and 2007, ORTT \"declared that all conditions for the extension had been met\"120 and agreed not to \"impose unjustified sanctions on Sl\u00e1ger,\" reflecting Sl\u00e1ger's compliance with the applicable norms.121\n\nMemorial, [151].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [34]; Rejoinder, [86], [90].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [33]; Rejoinder, [96]; *see also* T1/245/5 - 18.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [39] - [40].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [34].\n\nRejoinder, [92].\n\n*See* Rejoinder, [97]; *see also* T1/246 - 248.\n\n***3. Right to the award of the 2009 broadcasting licence***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Parties have presented diverging submissions as to the whether Sl\u00e1ger had a right to the award of a new broadcasting licence after 2009, and in particular, whether such right stems from section 107 of the Media Law. This provision reads:\n\n(1) Broadcasting rights for television are valid for maximum ten years, and rights for radio for maximum seven years, and may be renewed once upon expiry at the broadcaster's request, without inviting a tender, for an additional five years. The request for renewal must be notified to the Board fourteen months prior to expiry.\n\n(2) In the absence of the reporting notification referred to in Subsection (1) or if renewal cannot be awarded, the Board must publish an invitation to tender twelve months prior to the expiry of the license.\n\n(3) The license cannot be renewed if the right-holder violated the contract repeatedly or seriously.\n\n(4) The provisions relating to the award of rights must otherwise apply to the procedure for the renewal of such rights.\n\n*(a)*  *Respondent's submission*\n--------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nRespondent submits that section 107 of the Media Law is unambiguous and provides for a strict \"Term of Rights,\" \"limiting the holder of a commercial radio broadcasting right to a \u2018maximum' seven year term, which may be renewed \u2018once' for an additional five years.\"122 Wherever contemplated by the Media Law, the possibility of multiple renewals was stated expressly.123 In contrast with the interpretation advanced by Claimants, Respondent's interpretation of section 107 is as follows:\n\nSubsection (1) of Section 107 expressly says that the broadcasting right \"may be renewed once,\" *i.e.* not two times or twenty times, and states that the renewal shall be for \"five years,\" *i.e.* not for an indefinite period. Subsection (2) refers to cases where the single \"renewal\" allowed by subsection (1) is theoretically possible, but \"cannot be awarded.\" The provision clearly distinguishes between a \"renewal\" and a \"tender\" of rights, making Claimants' asserted entitlement to \"renewals of a broadcasting right by tender\" a contradiction in terms.124\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [10].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [120]; Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I, [34].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [73].\n\n78.\n\nIt further contends that neither Claimants nor ORTT ever suggested that a right to renewal or an incumbent advantage existed under the Media Law, the GTT, or the Broadcasting Agreement, in any communication leading up to the submission of bids in the 2009 Tender.125\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [50].\n\n79.\n\nFirst, Sl\u00e1ger and its shareholders did not assert \u2018a legal right' to continue broadcasting beyond the 12-year term:126\n\n\u25a0 None of Claimants' documentary exhibits contain any evidence that Sl\u00e1ger asserted, in advance of the 2009 Tender, a *right* to an incumbent advantage or other legal entitlement arising out of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement.127\n\n\u25a0 Sl\u00e1ger submitted a bid including a conservative business plan \"based \u2018only' on the seven-year broadcasting term. It included a detailed financial model projecting profitable operations and a healthy return of investments within the term.\"128\n\n\u25a0 According to Emmis' accounting statements and annual reports from 1997 through 2009, \"the Sl\u00e1ger broadcasting right was in fact depreciated as a \u2018definite -lived' intangible and was fully amortized by the end of 2009 [\u2026].\"129 Accordingly, Emmis did not consider Sl\u00e1ger's broadcasting right as having any value beyond 2009.130\n\n\u25a0 The Emmis parent company's regulatory filings before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (**U.S. SEC**) reflected the understanding that after the first renewal there could be no guarantee of renewal.131\n\n\u25a0 Similarly, the expectations of Claimant MEM, are not based on assurances or representations by the government, but instead on its own reading of Hungarian Law or its experience in other countries.132\n\n*See* Reply, [12] - [23]; *see also* T1/34/18 - 36/15.\n\nReply, [22].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [27]\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [28].\n\nReply, [15]; Expert Report of Dr Charles Jonscher dated 9 August 2013, (**Jonscher Report**), [97] *et seq*.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [121].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [124].\n\n80.\n\n*Second*, Hungarian authorities never transmitted to Sl\u00e1ger or its shareholders reason to believe or expect that they held a legal right to licence renewal:\n\n\u25a0 The 1997 Call for Tender clearly stated that what was being put up for tender was a seven year broadcasting right.133\n\n\u25a0 The single renewal possibility under the Media Law was by no means a certainty for Sl\u00e1ger, and even Sl\u00e1ger lawyers approached Hungarian authorities to confirm whether a five year renewal would be forthcoming.134\n\n\u25a0 There are no contemporaneous ORTT statements discussing a right to renewal by incumbent broadcasters.135\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [23].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [36], [37]; *see* Letter from I. K\u00f3nya to ORTT, 21 February 2001, (R-18).\n\nReply, [24] - [27]; *see also* T1/64/16 - 65/3.\n\n81.\n\nUpon expiry of a broadcasting agreement that has been renewed, there is no provision in Hungarian law requiring ORTT to hold a tender. The ORTT enjoyed broad discretion as to the policy options they exercised in terms of managing the broadcasting frequency spectrum.136 In fact, the \"State had discretion to re-issue the broadcasting right via tender or, alternatively, to reassign the vacant frequency to another use.\"137 According to Respondent, this point is supported by the fact that the 2009 Tender was not called on the basis of section 107 of the Media Law, but rather on the basis of ORTT's general power to call tenders under section 41(1)(a).138 It further brings to the Tribunal's attention that Claimants' own regulatory filings confirm that \"Hungarian Law is silent about what happens after 12 years.\"139\n\nT2/340/4 - 18.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [16]; *see also* T1/60/20 - 61/4.\n\nT1/60/14 - 17; T2/335/9 - 11.\n\n*See* Emmis Communications Corporation, Annual Report, Form 10-K (fiscal year ended 29 February 2008), (R-4); Emmis Communications Corporation Annual Report, Form 10-K (fiscal year ended February 2009), 8 May 2009, (R-49).\n\n82.\n\nFurthermore, according to Respondent, Claimants lobbied politically for an amendment to the Media Law introducing a right of renewal to the incumbent licencee, precisely because they knew that the applicable legal framework did not give them the right to a new Broadcasting Agreement.140 Such an amendment, while proposed by Congress, was never enacted into law since it was declared unconstitutional. The Hungarian Constitutional Court declared that indefinite renewals of the national radio frequencies, even pending transition to digital radio were unconstitutional because they limited competition and new market entry.141\n\n*See* T1/37/13 - 39/10; *see also* Letter from Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3 and Emmis to Dr Gyorgy J\u00e1nosi, 10 September 2008, (C-266).\n\nT1/39/14 - 22; 91/16 - 21; Constitutional Court Decision No. 71/2009 (VI.30.), 14 July 2009, (R-50).\n\n83.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' argument that Sl\u00e1ger's right to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement would in any case vest upon the closure of the bidding process, since all other bidders should have been disqualified and Sl\u00e1ger having submitted the only qualifying bid, had to be awarded the licence agreement.142 Instead, according to Hungary, the right to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement never vested.143 Respondent alleges that in order to accept such a theory, the Tribunal would need to find (a) that all the other bidders should have disqualified from consideration outright; (b) that the Supreme Court of Hungary misread Hungarian Law on whether the ORTT had improperly conducted the Tender Procedure and breached the Tender Rules, since the issue of Sl\u00e1ger's alleged wrongful disqualification was litigated and rejected up all three levels of the Hungarian Courts, including to the Supreme Court, and, (c) that the Metropolitan Court erred on its reading of Hungarian Law by holding that when a challenger demonstrates that the winning bidder should have be disqualified, the most it can obtain is the invalidation of the awarded Contract and possibly the rerunning of the Tender.144\n\nT1/43/12 - 46/2.\n\nT1/59/5 - 6.\n\n*See* T1/45/17 - 49/2; *see also* T1/100 - 101.\n\n84.\n\nRespondent also rejects Claimants' theory that the 2009 CFT constituted an offer which was accepted by Sl\u00e1ger when presenting the Bid, thereby constituting a contract, which would bind the ORTT to proceed to award the licence in accordance with the call for tenders. Respondent alleges instead that the investors, including Sl\u00e1ger, submitted a \"tender offer,\" the bid itself, to be accepted or rejected by the ORTT. Furthermore, according to Respondent, pursuant to 2009 CFT Clause 3.44,145 further supported by section 76 of the GTT, the ORTT reserved the right to declare the tender inconclusive or unsuccessful and disqualify the entire bid process, even in the event of receiving valid bids if it considers it unsuitable. The bid can however be considered an irrevocable binding offer, which may be accepted within a limited period of time.146\n\nSee Clause 3.4.4. of the 2009 CFT, (CA-6), stating: \"the Board reserved the right to declare the Tender unsuccessful after the closure of the evaluation if it has not found any of the bidders submitting valid bids, suitable for concluding a Broadcasting Agreement with. \"\n\n*See* T2/455/21 - 468/8.\n\n85.\n\nAccordingly, since the right to a new licence never vested, Respondent submits that Claimants cannot claim expropriation of a right they did not hold.147\n\n*See* T1/59.\n\n*(b)*  *Claimants' submission*\n------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nClaimants plead that:\n\n[I]t has never been the Claimants' case that they were entitled to be awarded the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement. What we say is they had legal rights, which, had they been respected, would have left them as the only qualifying bidder. And in that situation, the ORTT was obligated to award the Broadcasting Agreement to them. [\u2026] And if the Tribunal wipes away the wrongful conduct of the State, we are left with the entitlement to that Broadcasting Agreement.\n\nThe rights that we rely upon are the ones they had vested as part of the investment, as part of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, and to which we were entitled under Hungarian Law. The consequence of those rights, as of the closing date of the bids, was that the Claimants became entitled to the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.148\n\nClaimants conclude that \"but for the failure of ORTT to apply the rules of the Tender that they themselves determined, Sl\u00e1ger would have been the only valid bidder, and, therefore, the winner of the Tender and thus [\u2026] the ORTT would have been obliged to award Sl\u00e1ger the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.\"149 According to Claimants, this right vested when the 2009 bid closed, but was extinguished as consequence of ORTTs violations: \"[T]he sequence is that the right existed, and it was extinguished, not that the right would have existed but for the behavior of Hungary.\"150\n\nT1/181/3 - 20.\n\nClaimants submit that the other bidders did not meet the required qualifications, because they lacked the necessary financial support for the submitted financial plans or broadcasting fees; the necessary bank certificates of first operating funds; or the requisite corporate form: T1/187, 256/14 - 258/21.\n\nT1/264/12 - 15.\n\n87.\n\nIn this case, Hungarian law imposed obligations on ORTT as to the steps to be taken following expiry of the Licence. Claimants submit that ORTT cannot arbitrarily decide how to reallocate frequencies after a broadcasting agreement expires, since this is inconsistent with the policy purposes of the Media Law and also to ORTT's own statement as expressed in the local proceedings.151 Claimants agree with Respondent that the 2009 Call for Tender was called by operation of section 41 of the Media Law but assert that the \"timing of the exercise of the authority\" is governed by section 107 of the Media Law.152 Accordingly, ORTT had an obligation to re-tender after the 12 years broadcasting licence expired.\n\n*See* T1/253 - 254.\n\nT2/399; Second Supplemental Expert Legal Opinion of Dr P\u00e9ter Moln\u00e1r dated 25 November 2013, (**Moln\u00e1r III**), [26].\n\n88.\n\nIn addition, the 2009 Call for Tenders constituted an offer to abide by the terms of the tender process that was later accepted unconditionally by Sl\u00e1ger through the bid, and simultaneously undertaking a conditional obligation to conclude the Broadcasting Agreement, with specific and binding unaltered terms. This is confirmed by the definition of \"bid\" included in the CFT itself.153\n\nT2/472/4 - 474/2, citing 2009 CFT, 20 July 2009, (CA-6).\n\n89.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's argument that Claimants did not expect its licence to extend further than 2009. Respondent has mischaracterised Claimants' business expectations and accounting treatment, as \"the evidentiary record shows that Sl\u00e1ger intended to remain in Hungary for the longer term\" given that:154\n\n\u25a0 Claimants invested considerable funds and efforts reflecting an investment for the long term and not limited to a seven-year licence, renewed for five years;155 this is confirmed with Emmis' track record of focusing on strategic investments rather than short-term deals that turn a quick profit.156\n\n\u25a0 Claimants continued investing in Sl\u00e1ger as late as 2008. Such a decision would be illogical if the Claimants would have to exit the market in 2009.157\n\n\u25a0 The filings before the U.S. SEC reflect that the Claimants \"expected - and [were] entitled - to be treated fairly in the Hungarian licence-renewal process and had a legitimate expectation of renewal, but we reported accurately to our investors that renewal was not a forgone conclusion.\"158\n\n\u25a0 The financial records of Sl\u00e1ger were prepared in light of the applicable accounting rules, which did not necessarily let the non-U.S. broadcasting licences be treated as having \"indefinite lives\"159 but \"Emmis expected to be allowed to continue to enjoy the benefits of their investment well beyond the time that initial capital for commencement of operations was returned.\"160\n\nRejoinder, [20]; T1/172/4 - 17.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [4]; Second Witness Statement of Jeffrey H.

An investment under the Treaties and the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. An investment under the Treaties***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is the starting point for interpretation of the Treaties.163\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [132] - [133]; Counter-Memorial, [156] - [159].\n\n*(a)*  *Respondent's submission*\n--------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nRespondent accepts that \"Claimants at one time made an investment in Hungary,\" but alleges that \"such investment was set to - and did - expire by its own terms in November 2009.\"164 It is Respondent's position that:\n\nTo meet the definition of \"investment\" under both the Netherlands and the Switzerland BITs, Claimants must prove that they had rights in relation to the 2009 Tender that qualify as \"assets.\" Both treaties expressly tie the definition of \"investment\" to assets located in the host State.165\n\nNo definition of \"asset\" appears in the BITs and Respondent asserts that such word should be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning, consistent with the object and purpose of the treaty.166\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [142].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [130].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [132] - [133].\n\n93.\n\nRespondent contends that:\n\n[T]he mere existence of a right under host State law is insufficient to prove that a protected \"asset\" exists. Not every \"right\" created by domestic law constitutes an \"asset.\" For example, even though domestic law may create a right to free speech or to freedom of religion, because such rights are generally applicable rather than proprietary, and are not capable of being bought or sold for economic value, they cannot be considered \"assets.\" Furthermore, even if generally-applicable legislation provides some incidental benefit to an investor, the rights to such legislation do not *belong* to an investor in an ownership sense and such legislation therefore does not qualify as an \"asset\" of the investor.167\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [135].\n\n94.\n\nHungary further submits that \"investment treaties do not protect pre-contract expenditures, [i.e. rights related to the process of forming or acquiring an investment] even if made with a strong expectation of winning the contract.\"168 According to Respondent, prior ICSID claims have failed in very similar situations, confirming that \"expenditures are irrelevant, process rights are irrelevant, and even creating a local incorporated company is irrelevant if the Claimant did not, in fact, acquire the right it claims to have been denied.\"169\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [138] [Emphasis in original], citing McLachlan et al., International Investment Arbitration (Chapter 6) [6.50.], and also referring to *William Nagel v Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 049/2002, Award, (Danelius, Hunter & Kronke), 9 September 2003, [326]; *see also* T1/137/16 - 19.\n\nT1/151/10 - 14.\n\n95.\n\nEndorsing the reasoning of the *Apotex*, *Joy Mining, F-W Oil and Zhinvali* tribunals, Respondent alleges that \"a right does not qualify as an \u2018asset' if it is speculative or somehow contingent on future outcomes\"170 and concludes that \"to merit the protection as an investment under an investment treaty, a right must have vested specifically in the claimant; it is not sufficient merely that the claimant seems to have a prospect that the right may vest someday, *if* some future event occurs.\"171\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [136]; Reply, [92], [96], citing *Apotex Inc v Government of the United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, (Smith, Davidson & Landau), 14 June 2013, (***Apotex***), (RA-47); *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, (Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, Craig & Weeramantry), 6 August 2004, (***Joy Mining***), (RA-55); *F-W* *Oil Interests, Inc v Republic of Trinidad & Tobago*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/14, Award, (Nariman, Berman & Mustill), 3 March 2006, (***F-W Oil Interests***), (RA-32); and *Zhinvali Development Ltd. v Republic of Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1, Award, (Robinson, Jacovides & Rubin), 24 January 2003, (***Zhinvali***), (RA-78); *see also* T1/151/15 - 155/22.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [141].\n\n*(b)*  *Claimants' submission*\n------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nClaimants note that \"the BITs each protect \u2018every kind of asset'\"172 and contends that \"the BITs give the term \u2018investment' a broad, nonexclusive definition, recognizing that investment forms are constantly evolving.\"173 Accordingly, Claimants endorse authorities suggesting that BIT definitions of \u2018investment' should be interpreted broadly in accordance with their plain language.174\n\nCounter-Memorial, [162].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [163]; T1/272 - 274.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [163] - [164], citing *inter alia,* *Jan Oostergetel & Theodora Laurentius v Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction, (Kaufmann-Kohler, Wladimiroff & Trapl), 30 April 2010, (CA-124),[157]; *Tradex Hellas S.A. v Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Award, (Bockstiegel, Fielding & Giardina), 29 April 1999, (CA-125), [105] - [107]; *Fedax N.V. v Republic of Venezuela,* CSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, (Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, Heth & Owen), 11 July 1997, (CA-126), [34].\n\n97.\n\nAgainst this background, Claimants submit that they jointly control and are sole owner of the Hungarian project company, Sl\u00e1ger, which constitutes a qualifying investment under both applicable treaties:\n\nSince 1997 the Claimants made and held investments in the form of their interests in Sl\u00e1ger and its business operations. [\u2026] Sl\u00e1ger began broadcasting in 1997 under a Broadcasting Agreement with ORTT that, although due to expire in 2009 following the 2009 Tender, gave Sl\u00e1ger not only the right to broadcast, but also conferred upon it rights and protections relating to the renewal or future retendering of such broadcasting rights. Sl\u00e1ger remained a going concern, and the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement had not expired at the time of the measures giving rise to this dispute.175\n\n[The Claimants' investment] can be looked at in at least two ways. First, it suffices to note that the Claimants hold shareholdings in Sl\u00e1ger, and those shares are assets constituting a covered investment. Alternatively, the Claimants' investment is their interest in Sl\u00e1ger as a business operation, including the benefit of the bundle of rights and assets flowing from its 1997 Broadcasting Agreement in the context of the 2009 Tender. This, too, is a covered investment. Both viewpoints are correct.176\n\n[\u2026][T]he Claimants' claim is not, and never has been, that its \u2018investment' was an existing right to a new broadcasting agreement.177\n\nCounter-Memorial, [57].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [59].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [60].\n\n98.\n\nIn particular, Claimants re-iterate that (a) their \"main assets\" in this arbitration are \"their shares in Sl\u00e1ger, the existence and validity of which as investments' is undisputed\"178 and, (b) submit that a finding that the Claimants' shares in Sl\u00e1ger are covered \u2018investments' under the BITs and the ICSID Convention is sufficient for this Tribunal to confirm its jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*179\n\nCounter-Memorial, [187].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [60]; [170]; *see also* Rejoinder, [12], T1/273/10 - 11.\n\n99.\n\nClaimants also submit that their indirect interest in the rights and assets of Sl\u00e1ger, as a business operation constitute covered investments under each of the applicable BITs.180\n\nRejoinder, [12].\n\n100.\n\n*First*, the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement remained a valuable asset and constituted a protected investment since \"it contained claims to contractual performance in Hungary having economic value, and more particularly (a) comprised rights granted under public law (Netherlands-Hungary BIT, Article 1(1)(e)), and (b) constituted a concession under public law (Switzerland-Hungary BIT, Article 1(2)(e)].\"181\n\nCounter-Memorial, [182].\n\n101.\n\n*Second*, the Contract Framework conferred rights, which included \"the right to broadcast; the right of Sl\u00e1ger as the incumbent bidder to receive a preference or advantage in the tender process; and the guarantee that all tenders for the renewal of that broadcasting right shall be conducted according to law, in good faith, and on a fair, non-discriminatory, non-partisan and transparent basis.\"182\n\nCounter-Memorial, [64] - [66].\n\n102.\n\n*Third*, the rights stemming from the Regulatory Framework and the Broadcasting Agreement, included the right to a proper and lawful evaluation of Sl\u00e1ger's bid during the 2009 Tender and the right to an \"incumbent advantage.\" The latter in itself \"was a valuable asset\" according to Claimants, \"in the sense of something to which a third party investor or buyer would assign economic value in the period leading up to the 2009 Tender.\"183\n\nCounter-Memorial, [64] - [66].\n\n103.\n\nAccording to Claimants, investments can also be looked at as an \"indivisible\"184 or \"integrated\"185 whole. In particular, investments can be considered as \"as an aggregation of assets and transactions, a business operation, or an enterprise\".186 They posit that Claimants' rights arising in connection with the 2009 Tender are part of the indivisible whole of the Claimants' investment.187\n\nT1/278/17.\n\nT1/279/22, citing for support the *Telef\u00f3nica S.A. v Argentine Republic,* Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, (Sacerdoti, Brower & Siqueiros T.), 25 May 2006, and commentators Schreuer and Kriebaum.\n\nT1/276/16 - 277/6.\n\nT1/278/8 - 15.\n\n104.\n\nFinally, Claimants reject Respondent's reliance on the *Apotex* and *Joy Mining* decisions, because the Claimants do not allege their \"investment\" to be a future right to broadcast:\n\n[T]he Claimants' interest in Sl\u00e1ger is not \u2018speculative', \u2018contingent', a \u2018preinvestment expenditure', an \u2018expectation' or \u2018a hope'. Sl\u00e1ger was a going concern at the time of the 2009 Tender. It held at the material time existing legal rights under Hungarian law that were violated by Hungary's unlawful conduct during the 2009 Tender process.

An investment under the ICSID Convention***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a)*  *Respondent's submission*\n--------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nBy reference to the criteria adopted in *Salini*, Respondent submits that the rights relating to the 2009 Tender cannot qualify as an investment under the \"ICSID Convention.\"189 Relying on past arbitral decisions that suggest that \"for an investment to exist, a claimant must demonstrate not only that it has made a contribution\" but also that \"the contribution has resulted in the acquisition of rights,\"190 Respondent concludes that no contribution was actually made.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [143], [144] referring to S *alini Construttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, (Briner, Cremades & Fadlallah), 16 July 2001, (RA-35).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [144], citing *Malicorp Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, (Tercier, Baptista & Tschanz), 7 February 2011, (RA-56), [110]; *Apotex*, [193]; *Generation Ukraine Inc. v Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award, (Paulsson, Salpius & Voss), 16 September 2003, (***Generation Ukraine***), (CA-92), [18.4]; *Mr Franz Sedelmayer v Russian Federation*, SCC, Award, (Magnusson, Wachler & Zykin), 7 July 1998, (RA-52), [112].\n\n106.\n\nAlthough the shareholders' contribution to the debt funding resulted in acquisition of certain rights in Hungary, a right to broadcast following expiration of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement was not among those acquired.191 This conclusion is, according to Respondent, consistent with Claimants' investment expectations since \"Sl\u00e1ger presented financial plans for a business that would operate for seven years and that would, \u2018within those 7 years return its investors their money and earn them a substantial return, with no assumptions as to what will happen thereafter.'\"192 Respondent submits that radio broadcasting is not a capital-intensive activity in Hungary.193 It does not require an investment into radio transmission infrastructure. The broadcaster acquires the right to broadcast on a frequency and does not invest in the transmission infrastructure nor does it own or manage the frequency. It is operated on a rental model.194\n\nCounter-Memorial, [145].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [145].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [15].\n\nT1/54/11 - 18.\n\n*(b)*  *Claimants' submission*\n------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThere is wide controversy as to whether the *Salini* test, invoked by Respondent, should be applied as an objective test for the purpose of determining jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.195 Claimants submit that even addressing the elements of the test as pleaded by Hungary, Claimants' investment qualify as an investment for the purpose of the ICSID Convention as (a) Claimants' substantial contribution is reflected in the nearly HUF 856 million that Sl\u00e1ger's shareholders planned to invest in the equity of Sl\u00e1ger; (b) the investments were made in a period spanning over 12 years; (c) the activities carried the requisite degree of risk; and (d) the investment activities contributed to Hungary's economic development, since \"Claimants invested nearly 30 HUF billion (about USD 135 million) in Hungary, provided employment to an all-Hungarian staff, and brought best industry practices from its experiences around the world [...] and also brought a culture of corporate responsibility and charitable giving to Hungary.\"196\n\nCounter-Memorial, [220] - [222] referring *inter alia* to Schreuer et al. *The ICSID Convention: A* *Commentary* (2nd edn, 2009), (CA-162), Art. 25, [171] -[174]; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited. v United* *Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, (Hanotiau, Born & Landau), 24 July 2008, (CA-69), [317] - [318]; and *Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD v Malaysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Decision on Annulment, (Schwebel, Shahabuddeen & Tomka), 16 April 2009, (CA-163), [80].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [223] - [229]; T1/173/4, 281/9 - 14.\n\n108.\n\nClaimants characterise as \"artificial\" Respondent's attempt to draw a line between \"an old investment\" (its shareholding) and \"a new investment\" (rights arising out of the 2009 Tender) since it ignores the concept of business operation, with a company, assets and employees and overlooks that Claimants' investments in Sl\u00e1ger since 1997 led to the contractual and Hungarian Law rights relied upon by Claimants.197\n\nT1/282/14 - 22.\n\n**C. Rights capable of expropriation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that \"as a general matter of both international and Hungarian law, contractual rights are capable of being expropriated.\"198 But they do not agree that the rights acquired by Claimants in this case were capable of expropriation.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [195]; Reply, [98].\n\n*(a)*  *Respondent's submission*\n--------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nRespondent accepts that Claimants, as indirect shareholders in Sl\u00e1ger, are entitled to rely on Sl\u00e1ger's rights including its contractual rights.199 The proposition that Hungary disputes is that *Sl\u00e1ger* had rights capable of expropriation.200 According to Respondent, \"there cannot be an expropriation claim unless the complaint demonstrates the existence of proprietary rights.' Hungary recognises that certain \u2018intangible' rights are capable of being expropriated; however, such rights must be similar to property rights in the sense that they can be owned, acquired, transferred or sold.\"201 Hungary rejects Claimants' contentions that the rights allegedly arising from the Contract and Regulatory Frameworks can be expropriated.\n\nReply, [37].\n\nReply, [38].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [90] - [91], citing *Generation Ukraine*, [8.8]; T1/26/1 - 8; *see also* T1/141/7 -14; T2/354/2 - 9.\n\n111.\n\n*First*, in Respondent's view, \"even assuming, arguendo\" that Claimants held an \"incumbent advantage,\" ORTT's compliance with a GTT provision cannot be considered a proprietary right capable of giving rise to an expropriation claim, in the absence of a specific contractual undertaking such as a stabilization agreement.202 In particular:\n\nNotwithstanding Claimants' rhetorical insistence on the notion, the fact remains [...] that the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement did not create any contractual right to a dispositive \"incumbent advantage.\" The exclusive source of the alleged right to an advantage is Section 65.3.1 of the GTT, which, (1) is an individual passage of discretionary administrative guidelines; (2) does not represent a source specified by the Hungarian Law on Legislation to govern property-related issues; (3) did not clearly apply to the broadcasting right at issue in the 2009 Tender; (4) may not have been available to Sl\u00e1ger in any event, given its numerous breaches of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and 1996 Media Law; and (5) does not confer proprietary rights on any particular investor constituting an individual asset capable of expropriation. Moreover, [\u2026] [g]iven that ORTT retains full discretion to define the conditions, scope, and effect of the alleged preference, it cannot be considered sufficiently concrete to constitute a proprietary right capable of expropriation. As in *Merrill & Ring*, the rights alleged herein constitute \u2018only a *potential* future benefit that cannot be the subject of a taking because the Investor is not contractually entitled to them.'203\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [96]; *see also* T2/371/10 - 372/21.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [98]\n\n112.\n\n*Second*, Respondent emphasises that general process rights arising in connection with the conduct of the 2009 Tender, are not special to a particular investor or owned as an asset by the individual investors. Instead \"every single one of [the rights] could be claimed by all participants in the 2009 Tender. They don't belong to any one participant to the exclusion of others\"204 and therefore cannot be expropriated:\n\nEvery bidder in a tender has the right to be treated fairly under the rules of that tender. And the right to be treated fairly in that context is like the right to free speech or free religion; you may have it, you may be able to claim violation of it through certain procedures, but it's not a right you would hold to the exclusion of others. [\u2026] Procedural rights in a tender can't be expropriated, and the remedy for procedural errors can't be the award directly to you of the very thing you were bidding on in the first place, or, as they seek to do in this case, an immediate skip to a damages phase for the full value of the thing that you were trying to bid for without even providing the services that are the quid pro quo for that tender.205\n\nT1/142/10 - 16.\n\nT1/30/6 - 31/7.\n\n113.\n\nMoreover, \"given the simultaneously broad and vague nature of this purported right, Claimants lack the type of ownership or control [over the right] necessary for it to be considered \u2018proprietary.'\"206\n\nLike the alleged right to an \"incumbent advantage,\" the only source for Claimants' purported right \"to have th[e] tender conducted according to law in good faith and on a fair, non-discriminatory, non-partisan and transparent basis\" is a passage of the GTT \u2014 a document that is subject to change and cannot, as a matter of Hungarian and international law, create proprietary rights. The alleged \"right\" is not set forth in any contract, and Claimants have offered no valid basis on which to distinguish it from the principle of good faith applicable to *all* aspects of Hungarian civil law, and therefore to *all* participants in the 2009 Tender.207\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [105].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [105] [Emphasis in original].\n\n114.\n\nLikewise, Respondent considers that Claimants are, contrary to the Tribunal's Rule 41(5) Decision, \"attempt[ing] to transform Claimants' original fair and equitable treatment claim, to remain within the boundaries of this Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"208 However, \"if fair and equitable treatment were a legal \u2018right' whose denial is tantamount to expropriation, every alleged violation of fair and equitable treatment would also be an expropriation, and the object and purpose of treaty provisions expressly limiting consent to expropriation claims [\u2026] would be plainly and improperly defeated.\"209\n\nReply, [50].\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [102].\n\n115.\n\nHungary further submits there can be no \"expropriation claims\" of legitimate expectations under international law and even if that were the case, none of Claimants' alleged expectations would qualify \"as *objectively* \u2018legitimate' - as opposed to being simply *subjective* expectations\" not binding the government, because there must \"be some form of representation or assurance by the government itself, upon which the investor *thereafter* relied in making its decision to invest.\"210\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [112] - [114]; *see also* T2/382/9 - 12.\n\n116.\n\nBased on these elements, Respondent concludes that \"Claimants' claim for expropriation fails at the threshold level because Claimants cannot establish the existence of a right, constituting an investment, capable of being expropriated. Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they \u2018had a clear right' to the award of a new broadcasting license.\"211 \"The only rights Claimants possessed were those of an ordinary losing bidder, including the right to challenge an allegedly improper tender (but not the substantive right to a new broadcasting agreement).\"212\n\nReply, [99].\n\nReply, [99].\n\n*(b)*  *Claimants' submission*\n------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nClaimants assert that \"rights in rem\" are not a prerequisite to an expropriation claim and rely on several arbitral decisions to conclude that \"they may also extend to contractual rights.\"213 They further submit that an \"indirect expropriation may also be caused by a violation of noncontractual rights.\"214\n\nCounter-Memorial, [196] - [199]; Rejoinder, [57].\n\nT1/286/12 - 14, citing *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05, Award, (Cremades, Rovine & Siqueiros T.), 21 November 2007, (RA-48).\n\n118.\n\nClaimants contend that \"direct transferability\" of a right, \"does not constitute a condition *sine qua non* \" for a right to be categorised as proprietary.215 They further suggest that, independently of whether they can be alienated or not, their rights are proprietary in accordance with section 2(1) of the Hungarian Civil Code, which, according to Claimants, requires all rights to be classified as proprietary if they are not inherent.216\n\nT2/432/15 - 433/4.\n\nT2/407/7 - 16, T2/433/6 - 14.\n\n119.\n\nContrary to Hungary's contentions, the relevant provisions of the Media Law and the GTT at issue, were not generally or even broadly applicable: they either protected specific qualified persons that had invested considerable sums to qualify for such protection, in a sense \"buying\" access to the relevant rights; or conferred a tangible benefit solely on the incumbent broadcaster as a reward for its prior investments and lawful operation of its frequency.217 Claimants concede that such rights (other than the incumbent advantage) would accrue to \"all Bidders who would fulfil the requirements and incur the costs in accessing those right\"218 but assert that \"the rights that Sl\u00e1ger possesses as an incumbent broadcaster and as a duly registered bidder in the 2009 Tender were not available to the general public, and had real financial value.\"219\n\nRejoinder, [127].\n\nT2/408/2 - 16.\n\nRejoinder, [122].\n\n120.\n\nClaimants add that paying a bidding fee in itself does not constitute an investment, but rather that the \"fact that there is a monetary threshold for accessing specific rights and benefiting from them renders those rights proprietary.\"220 The value of the fee is further confirmed by the fact that under Hungarian law courts can order the reimbursement of the bidding fee as remedy for the violation of the bidding rights.221 Claimants further submit that damages may be awarded for breach of contractual rights. They accept that this would extend, in the case of the rights under the Regulatory Framework to all disappointed bidders who fulfilled the relevant legal requirements.222\n\nT1/268/21 - 269/3.\n\nT1/268/16 - 21.\n\nT2/409/4 - 410/9.\n\n121.\n\nClaimants submit that the incumbent advantage has a specific economic value and therefore qualifies as proprietary. They illustrate this point by submitting that if, for example, an independent third party were to consider entering in the Hungarian market, it would, all other things being equal, pay a premium to acquire Sl\u00e1ger with the incumbent advantage over another competitor that did not have that advantage.223\n\nT1/278/8 - 15; *see also* T2/404/21 - 405/8.\n\n122.\n\nClaimants have presented a *prima facie* case of expropriation for purposes of the jurisdictional phase,224 and their claim has been mischaracterised by Hungary as a fair and equitable treatment claim.225 Hungary's breach of rights arising out of or incorporated in the Broadcasting Agreement \"was capable of amounting to an indirect expropriation of the Claimants' investment under international law.\"226 Claimants are not alleging a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the Treaties.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [207].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [214] - [216].\n\nCounter-Memorial, [216].\n\n**D.

Rather, Hungary relies upon the plain words of the ICSID Convention, seeing no basis to depart from the standard rules of treaty interpretation in favour of either a restrictive or liberal approach.229\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [147].\n\nReply, [105].\n\n125.\n\nAs all of the rights held by Claimants in relation to the 2009 Tender were generally-applicable rights enjoyed by all bidders \u2014 not proprietary rights granted specifically to Claimants as a result of their contributions, these rights were completely unconnected with any pre-existing investment or the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement (which contained no additional rights and did not transform general due process rights into personal obligations owed to Claimants).230\n\nReply, [104].\n\n126.\n\nThis is not sufficient. To comply with the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention, the alleged investment must include the rights underlying the expropriation claim, which in turn, must be capable of expropriation.231 Thus, in order to proceed any further, the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement must have included the rights underlying the claim, and \"any argument based upon the rights Claimants held by virtue of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement as Shareholders in Sl\u00e1ger or otherwise, must be set aside.\"232\n\nT1/147/10 - 12.\n\nT1/147/21 - 148/5.\n\n127.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimants' reliance on the *Lemire* case.233 In contrast to the present case, the arbitration agreement in *Lemire* expressly covered non-impairment by arbitrary and discriminatory measures of the \"expansion of investments.\" Therefore it was possible for that tribunal to establish a causal link between Claimant's prior investment and the dispute between the parties.234\n\n*Joseph C.

The rights were \"an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment.\"237 The dispute \"need not arise out of physical property of the investor\"238 as it can \"emanate from the investment itself or the operations of the investment\"239 or even \"concern a transaction that does not itself constitute an investment;\"240\n\n(b) Bearing in mind the natural and ordinary meaning of the word \"directly\", which means \"with nothing or no one in between\", and with support of arbitral practice, it is plain, as a matter of common English usage that \"State's measures [that] affect the core objectives of an investment, such as its \u2018sustainability or profitability'\" are clearly related to the investment;241\n\n(c) A causal link must be established between the dispute and the investment; whether the governmental measure is specifically targeted at the investment in question is irrelevant and therefore Hungary's measures at stake need not be specifically targeted at Sl\u00e1ger's shareholding;242\n\n(d) ICSID tribunals and arbitral authority commentary have consistently held that a dispute with a foreign shareholder relating to the assets of a local company, such as its contracts or licences, is a dispute that arises directly out of an investment.243\n\nCounter-Memorial, [245] - [249].\n\nSchreuer et al. *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn, 2009), (CA-162), 106.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [249].\n\nT1/288/15 - 16.\n\nT1/288/16 - 18, citing *Tokios Tokeles v Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, (Weil, Bernardini & Price), 29 April 2004, (CA-154).\n\nT1/288/19 - 22, citing *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka, a.s. v Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, (Buergenthal, Bernardini & Bucher), 24 May 1999, (CA-94).\n\nCounter-Memorial, [241] - [244], citing *Lemire*, [95] - [96].\n\nT1/289/14 - 290/2, citing *CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, (Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, Lalonde & Rezek), 12 May 2005, (CA-62), and *Total S.A. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, (Sacerdoti, Marcano & Alvarez), 25 August 2006, (CA-140).\n\nCounter-Memorial, [250] - [257]; T1/290 - 291.\n\n129.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Sl\u00e1ger was directly subjected to, and legally and economically affected by, the measures [taken by Hungary in respect of the 2009 Tender.] [\u2026] Hungary's measures violated commitments made to, or rights enjoyed by, Sl\u00e1ger, and thereby violated Hungary's treaty obligations towards their investment.

RELEVANT LEGAL TEXTS**\n---------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal sets forth below the relevant portions of the legal texts germane to its Decision.\n\n**A. ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which is found within Chapter II headed \"Jurisdiction of the Centre\", provides:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n132.\n\nArticle 41 of the Convention, which is within Chapter IV section 3 headed \"Powers and Functions of the Tribunal,\" provides:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits.\n\n133.\n\nArbitration Rule 41 \"Preliminary Objections\" provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\n\n(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.\n\n**B. Netherlands BIT**\n----------------------\n\n134.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Netherlands BIT provides:\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall take any measure depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the former Contracting Party may have given;\n\n(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\n\n135.\n\nArticle 1(1) provides:\n\n[T]he term \"investments\" shall comprise every kind of asset connected with the participation in companies and joint ventures, more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights *in rem* in respect of every kind of asset;\n\n(b) rights derived from shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures;\n\n(c) title to money, goodwill and other assets and to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes and know-how;\n\n(e) rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources.\n\n136.\n\nArticle 10 of the Netherlands BIT provides:\n\n(1) Any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment shall as far as possible be settled by the disputing Parties in an amicable way.\n\n(2) If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either Party requested amicable settlement, it shall upon request of either disputing party be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. In this case the provisions of paragraphs 3-9 of Article 9 shall be applied *mutatis mutandis.* [\u2026]\n\n(3) In case both Contracting Parties have become members of the [ICSID Convention], disputes between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party under the first paragraph of the present Article shall be submitted for settlement by conciliation or arbitration to [ICSID].\n\n**C. Swiss BIT**\n----------------\n\n137.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the Swiss BIT provides:\n\nNeither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments belonging to investors of the other Contracting Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, and under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and adequate compensation. The amount of compensation, interest included, shall be settled in the currency of the country of origin of the investment and paid without delay to the person entitled thereto, without regard to its residence or domicile.\n\n138.\n\nArticle 1(2) provides:\n\nThe term \"investments\" shall include every kind of assets and particularly:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as servitudes, mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(b) shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in companies;\n\n(c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, utility models, industrial designs or models, trade or service marks, trade names, indications of origin), know-how and goodwill;\n\n(e) concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.\n\n139.\n\nArticle 10 of the Switzerland BIT, which is headed \"Settlement of disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\", provides in relevant part:\n\n(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without prejudice to Article 9 of this Agreement (Settlement of disputes between Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months, the parties to the dispute may proceed as follows:\n\n(a) A dispute concerning Article 6 of this Agreement shall upon request of the investor be submitted to [ICSID] instituted by the [ICSID Convention].\n\n(b) In the event of a dispute not referred to in paragraph (2), letter a) of this Article the dispute shall be submitted, upon agreement on such submission by both parties to the dispute, to [ICSID].\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis of the questions of jurisdiction placed before it by the Parties for its decision by making an elementary point that is nevertheless fundamental to the whole of its reasoning. It is this. An arbitral tribunal owes its jurisdiction solely to the consent of the parties. In the case of an arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention, Article 25 states this requirement in terms by providing that \u2018[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment [...] *which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit* to the Centre' [emphasis added]. As the Executive Directors stated in their Report on the ICSID Convention: \u2018Consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.'245\n\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \"Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States\" 18 March 1965, [22].\n\n141.\n\nWhere the instrument evidencing the consent in writing of the host state is a bilateral investment treaty concluded between that state and the home state of the investor, the scope of matters capable of being submitted to arbitration by an investor will be determined by reference to the arbitration agreement providing for investor-state arbitration in the treaty.\n\n142.\n\nIn the present case, it is a striking feature of the investor-state arbitration agreements in both Treaties that they limit the scope of disputes capable of submission to arbitration by an investor to expropriation claims only. Article 10 of the Netherlands BIT refers only to \"[a]ny dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party concerning expropriation or nationalization of an investment.\" Article 10 of the Switzerland BIT likewise permits disputes \"concerning Article 6 of this Agreement\" to be submitted as of right to an arbitral tribunal. Article 6 is the provision prohibiting \"measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments belonging to investors of the other Contracting Party.\" Disputes concerning any other provision may be submitted to arbitration only with the consent of both disputing parties. Hungary gave no such consent in the case of the present dispute.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided this point in its Rule 41(5) Decision. But it is worth dwelling for a moment on the significant consequence of this point. The Treaties contain undertakings by both Hungary and, respectively, The Netherlands and Switzerland as to the protection and treatment to be accorded to investments of the other Contracting Party. Such undertakings create obligations binding on the Contracting States under international law that go well beyond the protection from expropriation. But the Contracting States decided to limit the scope of the right of an investor to invoke the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal to a single cause of action.246\n\nThe same limitation does not apply to the provision in the respective Treaties for the arbitration of disputes between the Contracting States, which extends respectively to \"[a]ny dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Agreement\": Art. 9 Netherlands BIT; or \"[d]isputes between Contracting Parties regarding the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Agreement\": Art. 9(1) Switzerland BIT.\n\n144.\n\nThis decision by the Contracting States has the following important consequence for the Tribunal's analysis. Had the Tribunal been granted a broader jurisdiction, it would have been possible to determine whether Claimants' investments in Sl\u00e1ger would benefit from, for example, the Treaties' fair and equitable treatment standard when it came to adjudging the Respondent's conduct of the bid. It would not be so crucial for the Claimants to prove the existence of a proprietary right pertaining to the 2009 tender under Hungarian law. But if, as here, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all claims except expropriation, and it is not alleged that Hungary expropriated Sl\u00e1ger while it held its broadcasting right under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, the only way that the expropriation claim can be held to be within the Tribunal's jurisdiction is if Sl\u00e1ger had a proprietary right that survived the expiry of its broadcasting right under that Agreement. The Contracting States' narrowing of the Tribunal's jurisdiction thus necessarily requires the Tribunal to ascertain what rights Sl\u00e1ger held in relation to the tendering of a new licence. This would be the situation in respect of the expropriation claim even if the Tribunal had a broader jurisdiction in that, having considered a fair and equitable treatment or other claim, when it came to considering the expropriation claim, the Tribunal would still have to determine whether Sl\u00e1ger had a proprietary right to a new licence. It is because the applicable Treaties have such narrow grants of jurisdiction that the issue becomes so prominent at the jurisdictional stage.\n\n145.\n\nAs a result, this Tribunal is only empowered by the instrument of consent concluded by the Contracting States to decide a dispute between the Parties if and to the extent that it is satisfied that the dispute concerns expropriation of the investment. Otherwise it is incompetent to proceed and must dismiss the Claimants' claim. It follows that any decision on this question cannot have any effect on any other claims that Claimants or any other person or state may have in relation to the matters that form the subject of the present dispute in any other forum.\n\n**B. Matters already decided**\n------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nAlthough the written and oral pleadings of the Parties have ranged widely over numerous detailed issues, the Tribunal's decision-making task on the present challenge to its jurisdiction is focused by (1) the matters that it has already decided as a result of its Rule 41(5) Decision and its Bifurcation Decision; and (2) the matters that are common ground between the Parties. Accordingly, the Tribunal will set out the material aspects of each of these before identifying the issues still in dispute on which its present decision must rest.\n\n***1. Jurisdiction limited ratione voluntatis to expropriation***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\n*In the first place*, the Tribunal has determined in its Rule 41(5) Decision that its jurisdiction is limited to claims of expropriation. To be sure, it considered that such claims might potentially be advanced under customary international law as well as in accordance with the Treaties. But nothing is said by the Parties to turn upon this distinction for the purpose of the present challenge to jurisdiction. The Non-Expropriation Claims that had been originally advanced by Claimants (including claims for breach of the treaty standards of fair and equitable treatment; protection against discrimination; failure to observe obligations and the claim of breach of the international minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors) fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, without prejudice to any merit that those claims may have in another forum.\n\n***2. Jurisdiction limited ratione materiae to an investment***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\n*In the second place,* the Tribunal has held in its Bifurcation Decision that this requires it to determine:247\n\n[...] whether, and if so which investments of Claimants are capable of giving rise to their expropriation claim. This is so because, if Respondent's jurisdiction objection were to be upheld, the consequence would be that the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over the present case as a whole. Both Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the scope of the protection from expropriation found in each of the Treaties are limited to \u2018investments' (in the latter case as therein defined). But the same point is equally valid were the Tribunal to deny Respondent's objection. In that event, the Tribunal would need to determine the nature and incidents of the rights held by Claimants that may be considered as investments capable of enjoying the protection of international law against expropriation before deciding whether Respondent's conduct had in fact caused any such expropriation. This would be so whether the proceedings were bifurcated or joined.\n\nBifurcation Decision, [43].\n\n***3. Law applicable to jurisdictional issue***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\n*In the third place,* the Tribunal has also decided that the determination of the jurisdictional issue before it requires in turn reference to each of Hungarian law and public international law:248\n\n[T]he existence and nature of any such rights must be determined in the first instance by reference to Hungarian law, before the Tribunal proceeds to decide whether any such rights can constitute investments capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation for the purpose of its jurisdiction under the Treaties and the ICSID Convention. That is the basis upon which Claimants plead their case. Respondent submits the same. The Tribunal agrees.249\n\n*Ibid,* [44].\n\nAccord: Douglas *The International Law of Investment Claims* (2009), (RA-45), 52.\n\n150.\n\nIt is for this reason that the Tribunal formulated the questions for determination as a preliminary matter as:\n\n(a) What rights, if any, did Claimants have under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect of the renewal of their broadcasting licence for any period after 18 November 2009;\n\n(b) To what extent, if at all, did those rights constitute an investment for the purpose of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and an investment capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation within the competence of this Tribunal under the Treaties; and,\n\n(c) Does the present dispute arise directly out of such investment for the purpose of Article 25?\n\n***4. Standard of proof on jurisdictional issue***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThese questions go to jurisdiction and must therefore be finally determined by the Tribunal, not decided on a *prima facie* basis. The Tribunal so held,250 citing Judge Higgins in her Separate Opinion in the International Court of Justice in *Oil Platforms*, when she said:251\n\nWhere the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose application and interpretation is contested, whether it has jurisdiction, that decision must be definitive [...]. It does not suffice, in the making of this definitive decision, for the Court to decide that it has heard claims relating to the various articles that are \"arguable questions\" or that are \"bona fide questions of interpretation\"[\u2026].\n\n*Ibid,* [52] - [53].\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)* (Preliminary Objection) [1996] ICJ Rep 803, Higgins Separate Opinion, [31].\n\n152.\n\nThe same point was made in the investment arbitration context by the Tribunal in *UPS v Canada* when it held:252\n\nAny ruling about the legal meaning of the jurisdictional provision, for instance about its outer limits, is binding on the parties.\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v Canada*, Award on Jurisdiction, (Keith, Fortier & Cass) (2002) 7 ICSID Rep 285, 297.\n\n153.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute the Tribunal's holding to this effect, nor that it is empowered to make such a determination at this preliminary stage.253\n\nMemorial, [1]; Rejoinder, [54].\n\n**C. Matters agreed between the Parties**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal's task is further assisted by the common ground between the Parties. These matters have already been identified earlier in this Award and may conveniently be summarised here in the following points.\n\n155.\n\nSignificantly, both Parties accept that Claimants had an investment by way of its shares in Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3 for 12 years from 1997 until 18 November 2009, which qualified for protection under the Treaties.254 They also accept that that investment was not expropriated prior to expiry of broadcasting licence on 18 November 2009.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [69(e)] (\"[\u2026] the present dispute does not \u2018aris[e] directly out of' Claimants' investments in Sl\u00e1ger, made in connection with the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, or from any rights derived from the shares of Sl\u00e1ger. As Sl\u00e1ger's accounts and official statements by its principal shareholder confirm, Sl\u00e1ger's rights under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, the company's principal asset, definitely terminated in November 2009 and had no connection with the 2009 Tender for a *new* license period, which is the subject of the present arbitration.\"); Counter-Memorial, [56]-[57], [59] (\"Hungary does not -and cannot - dispute that the Claimants hold lawful investments in Hungary in the form of their interests in Sl\u00e1ger and its business operations. The existence of an investment is in fact conceded; sweep away all the distraction and it is clear that the *only* open question Hungary raises is rather, whether the dispute before the Tribunal is a dispute arising directly out of that investment.\") *See also* Rejoinder, [138].\n\n156.\n\nIt follows that, unless the Claimants have rights under Hungarian law in respect of the period after 18 November 2009, they have no claim for expropriation. The question is what rights to renewal; what rights survive termination; what tangible or intangible assets investor retains. This last point was confirmed by the Claimants' answer to the Tribunal's hypothetical question: \u2018If the investor were the holder of an oil concession granted by a state for a period of 30 years where there was no right of renewal provided under the concession contract or under the general law of the host state, would the investor have any right capable of giving rise to a claim of expropriation after the expiry of the 30-year period?' Claimants' answer to this question in oral argument was:255\n\nNow, this is the Tribunal's hypothetical, and as stated, and without more, the answer would be no. After the 30-year period, there would be no contractual rights capable of expropriation. But in this hypothetical, we don't know what rights might survive termination of the Contract, what rights the investor might have held in respect of any new tender or what are the tangible or intangible assets the investor might have held.\n\nT2/415/6 - 14\n\n157.\n\nFinally, both Parties agree that \u2018as a general matter of both international and Hungarian law contractual rights are capable of being expropriated.'256 This last point is unexceptional in itself. But, given its significance for the issues presented for decision in the instant case, it requires some elucidation from the Tribunal.\n\nReply, [98]; \u2018rights under state contracts may be expropriated': Counter-Memorial, [195].\n\n**D. Rights capable of expropriation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nClaimants assert claims of expropriation derived from three legal sources:\n\n(a) Article 4 of the Netherlands BIT, which provides that \u2018[n]either Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments [...]';\n\n(b) Article 6 of the Switzerland BIT (headed \u2018Expropriation and compensation'), which provides that \u2018[n]either of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments belonging to investors of the other Contracting Party [...]'; and,\n\n(c) The customary international law protection against \u2018expropriation without compensation of Claimants' investments'.257\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [69].\n\n159.\n\nIn view of the fact that the only cause of action within the Tribunal's jurisdiction is that of expropriation, Claimants must have held a property right of which they have been deprived. This follows from the ordinary meaning of the term.258 The *Oxford English Dictionary* defines \u2018expropriate' as \u2018(of the state or an authority) take (property) from its owner for public use or benefit'/\u2018dispossess (someone) of property'. Its origin is from the medieval Latin *expropriat-\u2018* taken from the owner', from the verb *expropriare,* from *ex-* \u2018out, from' + *proprium \u2018* property', neuter singular of *proprius \u2018* own'.\n\nArt. 31(1) Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (\u2018VCLT').\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Waste Management II* made the same point when it held that the object of expropriation is the property of the claimant:259\n\nAn indirect expropriation is still a taking of property. By contrast where a measure tantamount to an expropriation is alleged, there may have been no actual transfer, taking or loss of property by any person or entity, but rather an effect on property which makes formal distinctions of ownership irrelevant.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, (Crawford, Civiletti & G\u00f3mez), 30 April 2004, (***Waste Management II***), (CA-48), [143].\n\n161.\n\nThe need to identify a proprietary interest that has been taken is confirmed by the definition of \u2018investment' in the Treaties. In each case, the Treaty refers compendiously to \u2018every kind of asset[s]'.260 The Oxford English Dictionary definition of \u2018asset' is:\n\n(usually **assets**) an item of property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments or legacies.\n\nThe definitions in the Treaties go on to provide particular examples of types of property or rights that may constitute an asset for this purpose. But these examples are not exhaustive.\n\nArt. 1(a) Netherlands BIT; Art. 1(2) Swiss BIT.\n\n162.\n\nIn order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law.261 Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law. As the *EnCana* Tribunal put it:262\n\n[F]or there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return (in a situation involving legal rights or claims as distinct from the seizure of physical assets) the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them [...]\n\nDouglas *The International Law of Investment Claims* (2009), (RA-45), Rule 4, 52.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN3481, Award, (Crawford, Thomas & Grigera Na\u00f3n), 3 February 2006, (CA-49), [184].\n\n163.\n\nThere is no doubt, as the Treaty definitions emphasise, that the notion of property or assets is not to be narrowly circumscribed. For this reason, tribunals have rejected a restriction to tangible property, emphasising that expropriation may equally protect intangible property.263 So, too, tribunals have held that the rights protected from expropriation as not limited to rights *in rem*.264 This is confirmed by the Treaties which include within their definition of assets qualifying as investments numerous other rights in addition to \u2018movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem'.265 This is unsurprising, since the definition of investment must apply compendiously to assets created under the law of the different municipal legal systems of the Contracting States. It is not to be circumscribed by technical distinctions that may have a different import under different municipal legal systems. The test is substantive, not technical.\n\nE.g. *Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v Islamic Republic of Iran* (1989) 21 Iran-US CTR 79, (Briner, Khalilian & Aldrich), 29 June 1989, (***Phillips Petroleum***), (CA-65), [106]; *White Industries Australia Limited v Republic of India,* UNCITRAL, Award, (Rowley, Brower & Lau), 30 November 2011, (CA-153), [12.3.1] - [12.3.3].\n\nE.g. *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Award, (Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga, El Mahdi & Pietrowski), 20 May 1992, (***SPP***), (CA-149), [164].\n\nArt. (1)(a)(i) Netherlands BIT; Art. 1(2)(a) Swiss BIT.\n\n164.\n\nA right conferred by contract *may* therefore constitute an asset for this purpose. Article 1(2)(e) of the Swiss BIT expressly so states. The position is in any event well established in customary international law,266 and has been followed by investment arbitral tribunals.267\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia* PCIJ Ser A No 7, 1926, 44; *Amoco International Finance Corp. v Islamic Republic of Iran* (1987) 15 Iran-US CTR 89, (***Amoco***), [108]; *Phillips Petroleum*.\n\nE.g. *SPP,* [164]; *Wena Hotels Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, (Leigh, Fadlallah & Wallace), 8 December 2000, (CA-83), [98].\n\n165.\n\nBut it is important to emphasise that the protection from expropriation in relation to rights conferred under contract still requires identification of a property interest or asset held by the claimant. As the Iran-US Claims Tribunal put it in *Amoco* :268\n\nExpropriation, which can be defined as a compulsory transfer of property rights, may extend to any right which can be the object of a commercial transaction, *i.e.,* freely sold and bought, and thus has a monetary value. [...] It is because Amoco's interests under the Khemco Agreement have such an economic value that the nullification of those interests by the Single Article Act can be considered as a nationalization.\n\n*Amoco,* [108].\n\n166.\n\nThe need to identify a property right or asset with commercial value not only equates with the basic concept of expropriation. It also aligns with the critically important distinction between rights protected by international law and contractual rights under municipal law. In its full analysis of the issue in *Waste Management II,* the Tribunal distinguished between cases in which the claim of expropriation of contractual rights was ancillary to a claim of expropriation of other property and \u2018the much smaller group of cases where the only right affected is incorporeal'. As to the latter, it said:269\n\n[...] these come closest to the present claim of contractual non-performance. [ *...* ] In such cases, simply to assert that \"property rights are created under and by virtue of a contract\" is not sufficient.270 The mere non-performance of a contractual obligation is not to be equated with a taking of property, nor (unless accompanied by other elements) is it tantamount to expropriation. [...]\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it is one thing to expropriate a right under a contract and another to fail to comply with the contract. Non-compliance by a government with contractual obligations is not the same thing as, or equivalent or tantamount to, an expropriation.\n\n*Waste Management II,* [174] - [175]; accord *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, (L\u00e9vy, Lalonde & Lew), 11 September 2007, [248].\n\nCiting *Shufeldt Claim* (1930) 2 RIAA 1083, 1097.\n\n167.\n\nMoreover, such an interpretation also accords with the separate and distinct function of the protection against expropriation as compared to the other protections included within the framework of the wider investment treaty. Thus:\n\n(a) Both Treaties provide for the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' of investments.271 This protection is designed to ensure that investments receive due process from the host State's administrative authorities and courts. That provision would not serve a useful and distinct function if procedural rights were treated as assets of the investor protected by the expropriation clause;\n\n(b) The Netherlands BIT specifically provides that \u2018[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.'272 Such a requirement to observe undertakings generally would be unnecessary if all undertakings, whether contractual, unilateral or under the general municipal law, were treated as assets subject to protection under the expropriation clause;\n\n(c) The Switzerland BIT specifically protects from impairment \u2018by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, should it so happen, liquidation of such investments'.273 A similar provision afforded the claimant a good cause of action in *Lemire v Ukraine* in relation to the award of radio broadcasting licences *.*274 But the Tribunal in that case emphasised the importance to its decision of the fact that the claim was brought for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and *not* for expropriation.275\n\nArt. 3(1) Netherlands BIT; Art. 4(2) Swiss BIT.\n\nArt. 3(5) Netherlands BIT.\n\nArt. 4(1) Swiss BIT.\n\n*See Lemire*.\n\n*Ibid,* [280].\n\n168.\n\nIt also follows from the basic notion that an expropriation clause seeks to protect an investor from deprivation of his property that the property right or asset must have vested (directly or indirectly) in the claimant for him to seek redress. This has been recognised by many tribunals, for example:\n\n(a) In *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v United Mexican States*,276 the Tribunal rejected an expropriation claim because \u2018the Claimant never really possessed a \"right\" [under Mexican law] to obtain tax rebates upon exportation of cigarettes.'\n\n(b) In *Generation Ukraine v Ukraine*,277 the Tribunal noted that since \u2018expropriation concerns interference with in rights in property, it is important to be meticulous in identifying the rights duly held by the Claimant at the particular moment when the alleged expropriation occurred.' The Tribunal went on to hold that in respect of a claimed right to use land, there \u2018cannot be an expropriation of something to which the Claimant never had a legitimate claim.'278\n\n(c) In *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*279, the Tribunal noted that the \u2018first step in assessing the existence of an expropriation is to identify the assets allegedly expropriated.'\n\n(d) In *Merrill & Ring v Canada,*280 the Tribunal rejected a claim that Canada had expropriated the claimant's interest in realizing fair market value for its logs on the international market because this was \"only a potential interest that may or may not materialize\" and was not therefore covered by the treaty protection from expropriation.\n\n(e) In *Crompton (Chemtura) Corporation v Canada*,281 the Tribunal held that, when analysing an expropriation claim, the first step was to determine \u2018whether there was an investment capable of being expropriated.'\n\n(f) In *Apotex v United States of America,*282 the Tribunal rejected claimant's argument that it had made an investment in the United States by applying for regulatory approval for a drug that it claimed it would have been granted but for Respondent's alleged breaches. The Tribunal held \"the critical enquiry must be as to the nature of the alleged \u2018 *property* ' as at the date of the alleged breach - not at some future point.\"283\n\n(g) In *Swisslion DOO Skopje v Macedonia*,284 the Tribunal found that the \u2018Claimant has not proven the juridical fact on which the second limb of its expropriation claim is based, i.e., that it had a clear right to recover the purchase price [of a share purchase and sale agreement that had been terminated] in that proceeding such that the court's failure to so order constituted an expropriation.'\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, (Kerameus, Covarrubiaz Bravo & Gantz), 16 December 2002, [118].\n\n*Generation Ukraine*, [6.2].\n\n*Ibid*, [22.1].\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, (Kaufmann-Kohler, Berman and B\u00f4ckstiegel), 27 August 2009, (CA-151), [442].\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Award, (Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, Dam & Rowley), 31 March 2010, (RA-58), [140].\n\n*Chemtura Corporation v Government of Canada* (formerly *Crompton Corporation v Government of Canada*), UNCITRAL Arbitration under Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA, Award, (Kaufmann-Koehler, Brower & Crawford), 2 August 2010, [242].\n\n*Apotex*, [215].\n\n*Ibid*, [215].\n\n*Swisslion DOO Skopje v former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16, Award, (Guillaume, Price & Thomas), 6 July 2012, (RA-66), [320].\n\n169.\n\nPausing at this point in the analysis, the Tribunal summarises the legal position under international law in the following way: the loss of a right conferred by contract may be capable of giving rise to a claim of expropriation but only if it gives rise to an asset owned by the claimant to which a monetary value may be ascribed. The claimant must own the asset at the date of the alleged breach. It is the asset itself - the property interest or chose in action - and not its contractual source that is the subject of the expropriation claim. Contractual or other rights accorded to the investor under host state law that do not meet this test will not give rise to a claim of expropriation.\n\n170.\n\nThus, when applied to the facts of this case, the legal test for an investment capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation within the competence of the Tribunal (the question posited as issue (b) in its list of issues for preliminary determination285) enables the Tribunal to undertake a more focused enquiry under issue (a) into the rights of Claimants, through their wholly-owned subsidiary Sl\u00e1ger under Hungarian law in 2009 in respect of the renewal (or fresh grant) of their broadcasting licence.286 The only question that the Tribunal must decide is whether Claimants held, prior to expiry of Sl\u00e1ger's broadcasting licence on 18 November 2009, contractual rights capable of constituting property or assets under Hungarian law *relating to the grant of a new* *broadcasting licence.*287\n\nBifurcation Decision, [57(b)], reproduced *supra* [150].\n\n*Ibid*, [57(a)].\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal must decide this question finally at the jurisdictional stage on the balance of probabilities. The Claimants bear the burden of proof. If the Claimants' burden of proving ownership of the claim is not met, the Respondent has no burden to establish the validity of its jurisdictional defences. As the tribunal held in *Saipem v Bangladesh* :288\n\nIn accordance with accepted international practice (and generally also with national practice), a party bears the burden of proving the facts it asserts. For instance, an ICSID tribunal held that the Claimant had to satisfy the burden of proof required at the jurisdictional phase and make a *prima facie* showing of Treaty breaches.\n\n*Saipem S.p.A. v People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, (Kaufmann-Kohler, Schreuer & Otton), 21 March 2007, (RA-63), [83], referring to *Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, (Guillaume, Cremades & Landau), 22 April 2005, (***Impregilo***), (CA-110), [79].\n\n172.\n\nThis passage touches upon two types of jurisdictional proof. The first relates to questions of fact that must be definitively determined at the jurisdictional stage. The second involves questions of fact that go to the merits, which the Tribunal must ordinarily not prejudge, unless they are plainly without foundation. This latter question necessarily involves assessing whether the alleged conduct of the Respondent is capable of constituting a breach of the substantive protections of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione materiae* but this has to be determined on a *prima facie* basis only.\n\n173.\n\nIn the context of the present case, the Claimants bear the burden of proving that they owned an investment capable of expropriation. This task lies fully within the ambit of the jurisdictional phase. This burden is to be contrasted with the need to establish on a *prima facie* basis at the jurisdictional phase that the Respondent breached the treaty. This question is based on whether the alleged unlawful conduct giving rise to the treaty breach\u2014 *if* it can be established in the merits phase\u2014is capable of falling within the treaty provisions invoked.289\n\n*Impregilo*, [254].\n\n174.\n\nIssues that are essential to establish jurisdiction, such as the existence or ownership of a covered investment, must be dealt with decisively in the jurisdictional phase. The Tribunal in *Phoenix Action Ltd v Czech Republic* articulated accepted practice when it observed:290\n\n[W]hen a particular circumstance constitutes a critical element for the establishment of jurisdiction itself, such fact must be proven, and the Tribunal must take a decision thereon when ruling on its jurisdiction. In our case, this means that the Tribunal must ascertain that the prerequisites for its jurisdiction are fulfilled, and that the facts on which its jurisdiction can be based are proven.\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, (Stern, Bucher & Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto), 15 April 2009, (RA-61), [64].\n\n175.\n\nWhere the Tribunal is presented with a question of municipal law essential to the issues raised by the Parties for its decision, the Tribunal, whilst retaining its independent powers of assessment and decision, must seek to determine the content of the applicable law in accordance with evidence presented to it as to the content of the law and the manner in which the law would be understood and applied by the municipal courts.291\n\n*Serbian Loans Case (France v Serb-Croat-Slovene State)* (1929) PCIJ Ser A, No. 20, 46; *Brazilian Loans Case (France v Brazil)* (1929) PCIJ Ser A, No. 21, 124; Recommendations 8 & 10-11, ILA Committee on International Commercial Arbitration Final Report \u2014Ascertaining the Contents of the Applicable Law in International Commercial Arbitration (2008) 73 ILA Conf. Rep. pp. 850, 881-2; *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on Annulment, (Tomka, Hascher & McLachlan), 23 December 2010, (***Fraport***), [236].\n\n176.\n\nThis is not to say that decisions of municipal courts arising directly out of the same set of facts will be necessarily dispositive of the question before an international tribunal. The tribunal retains its independent power to judge the probative value of evidence placed before it, including evidence of municipal law.292 But nevertheless, as Claimants accepted,293 determinations of municipal courts as to the content of the municipal laws that they are mandated to apply are likely to be of great help to an international tribunal.\n\n*Fraport,* [242].\n\nT2/414/9 - 17.\n\n177.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, it is now possible to proceed to an analysis of the proprietary rights under Hungarian law alleged by Claimants to give rise to their claim of expropriation in respect of the 2009 tender.\n\n**E. Legal characteristics of proprietary rights under Hungarian law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe evidence presented to the Tribunal supports the proposition that Hungarian law recognises a broad category of rights as proprietary, which are not limited to rights *in rem.* Respondent's Hungarian law experts accepted as much in opining that:294\n\n85. Hungarian law creates a wide array of rights and obligations set forth in different sources of laws, with the Hungarian Constitution reigning supreme. However, not all these rights are \"proprietary\", in the sense that they are capable of being owned and alienated by the entitled person (for instance, through sale, transfer, inheritance, etc.).\n\n86. Hungarian law recognises two categories of rights as having this \"proprietary\" character. The first one includes rights *in rem*, exercisable over tangible moveable an d immovable objects and regulated in Part III of the Hungarian Civil Code. The second is known as \"rights representing assets\" *(\"vagyoni \u00e9rt\u00e9ku jogok\").*\n\n87. The concept of \"rights representing assets\" is used to distinguish such rights from other rights and freedoms that cannot be owned or alienated and cannot form part of an estate. These can include claims under contracts, licenses, etc. The Constitutional Court has confirmed that \"rights representing assets\" enjoy the same constitutional protection as rights *in rem*.\n\n88. The concept of \"rights representing assets\" is also used by Act C of 2000 on accounting (the \"Accounting Law\") which regulates their accounting treatment as a form of asset: \"under intangible assets, [rights representing assets] shall include those acquired rights which are not related to real property. This includes, in particular, leases, rights of use, trusteeship, rights of utilization of intellectual products, brand names, licenses, furthermore, concessions, gaming rights, and other rights which are not related to immovables.\"\n\nK\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I, [85] - [87], references omitted.\n\n179.\n\nThis view is supported by the decision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court which confirmed:295\n\nArticle 13(1) of the Constitution sets forth the principle of protection of the right to property. *a)* Under the Constitutional Court's case law, the right to property is protected by the Constitution as a fundamental right [Constitutional Court decision no. 7/1991. (II. 28.), ABH 1991, 22, 25.]. Constitutional Court decision no. 17/1992. (III. 30.) provided that the constitutional protection of property rights covers not only things, as determined by civil law, but also rights representing assets (ABH 1992, 104, 108.). Under Article 2(3) of the [ *the Act under constitutional review* ] an operating license is a right representing assets which is attached to a person and which, under certain conditions determined by law, can be transferred and continue. Accordingly, the constitutional protection of right to property also protects an operating license.\n\nConstitutional Court Decision 28/2006 (VI.21) AB, (R-38).\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal sought clarification from the Parties as to whether it is necessary under Hungarian law for a right to be proprietary for it to capable of being sold or alienated, and, if so, on what authority on the record.296 Respondent maintained that the essential characteristic of a proprietary right is that it is capable of being sold or alienated, whilst accepting that the right did not lose this characteristic if the owner were under contractual or other restriction that prevented its actual sale.297\n\nT1/295/9 - 12.\n\nT2/353/11; 360/2 - 11.\n\n181.\n\nClaimants pointed out in oral pleading that rights did not need to be capable of being sold or alienated independently to be capable of being proprietary, giving the example of the statutory right of pre-emption of the co-owner of property or the goodwill of a company.298\n\nT2/431/22 - 432/19, citing, as to the right of pre-emption, section 145(2) Civil Code, (R-6).\n\n182.\n\nThus far the propositions advanced by the Parties are consistent with each other and with the formulation of the Constitutional Court. That is to say: a property right is one capable of being owned and transferred to another. It does not lose that characteristic because it cannot be transferred independently or because contractual or other legal conditions limit its transferability.\n\n183.\n\nBut counsel for Claimants went further and submitted that, as a matter of Hungarian law, all rights to be vindicated in a civil lawsuit must be either proprietary or inherent. Since the category of inherent rights was limited to those that attach to the person by reason of his existence as such (such as the right to privacy), it followed, he submitted, that all other rights are proprietary, including contractual or non-contractual obligations relating to goods.299 He cited as authority for this proposition section 2(1) of the Civil Code and the decisions of the Hungarian courts in the Sl\u00e1ger litigation.\n\nT2/432/20 - 435/2.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this proposition is not advanced in any of the three reports submitted by Dr Moln\u00e1r, Claimant's expert on Hungarian law, whether in response to the passage cited above from Respondent's experts or otherwise.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the authorities relied upon by Claimants itself and is satisfied that they do not stand for so broad a concept of proprietary rights. Section 2(1) of the Civil Code (in the English translation agreed between the Parties300) provides:\n\n\u2018This Act shall protect the property rights, inherent rights, and lawful interests of all persons.'\n\nIt will be immediately observed that this over-arching statement extends not just to property rights and inherent rights, but also to the *\u2018lawful interests of all persons'*.\n\nEmail communication of counsel to the Tribunal Secretary dated 18 December 2013.\n\n186.\n\nThe Code does not offer a definition of \u2018property rights'. It is divided into five Parts: (One) Introduction; (Two) Persons; (Three) Ownership; (Four) Obligations; and (Five) Succession. Part Three on Ownership opens with a provision (section 94) on the objects of ownership, which provides:\n\n(1) There may be ownership of all things which are *capable of appropriation*.301\n\n(2) Unless otherwise provided by law, the provisions pertaining to ownership shall duly apply to money and securities as well as to natural resources that can be utilized in the same way as things.\n\nA separate Part (Four) deals with Obligations. It is that Part which includes in its Title I the provisions on Contracts. This Title includes a number of references to contractual rights.302 The Tribunal's preliminary conclusion from this reference to the Code is that Hungarian law recognises substantive civil rights, enforceable in the courts, other than proprietary rights. Included in this category of other civil rights are those enforceable by contract.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nE.g. section 207(4) (waiver of rights); section 233(2) (third party rights); sub-section 315-6 (breach).\n\n187.\n\nThis view is confirmed by the approach of the Hungarian courts in the *Sl\u00e1ger* proceedings relied upon by Claimants.303 In these proceedings, Sl\u00e1ger sought to challenge the 2009 Tender conducted by ORTT. A preliminary question for the Metropolitan Court was the legal basis for the claim. The Court held:304\n\nPursuant to the Act, Defendant I [ORTT] acts in the tender proceedings and the legal relationship [...] created by the broadcasting agreement in part as an administrative authority and in part as a subject of civil law. The Act expressly defines in which cases Defendant I acts as an administrative authority and it only regulates within the confines of this proceeding the opportunities of the bidder to obtain remedies. The Act does not contain any provisions on the protection measures available to the bidder out of these confines, therefore legal protection of the bidder can be enforced in the courts of law, in part pursuant to Section 2(1) and 7 (1) of the Civil Code, and in part pursuant to Section 87 of the General Terms of Tender (applicable in the tender proceeding by the authorization of Act I of 1996) and Section 1.3.2. of the Call For Tender, and the general rules of the Code of Civil Procedure apply.\n\n*Sl\u00e1ger v ORTT* Metropolitan Court, 19 January 2010, (CA-11); Metropolitan Court of Appeals, 14 July 2010, (CA-14).\n\n*Sl\u00e1ger v ORTT* Metropolitan Court, 19 January 2010, (CA-11), 20 - 21.\n\n188.\n\nSection 7(1) of the Code provides:305\n\nEach and every government agency shall be obliged to protect the rights provided by law. Unless otherwise stipulated by law, those rights shall be enforced in the court of law.\n\nCivil Code, (R-6).\n\n189.\n\nThe Court's finding that Sl\u00e1ger's rights in the tender could be enforced under the Civil Code did not, however, entail a finding that such rights were proprietary. On the contrary, the Court proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief that the terms of the GTT had not been complied with.306 It held:307\n\nThe right of the Plaintiff to be protected is that in a compulsory tender proceeding prescribed by law for the selection of the person of the broadcaster, the person of the broadcaster be selected in compliance with the provisions of law, from among those who submitted a valid bid.\n\n[...]\n\n[T]he declaration that Defendant I should not have concluded the agreement with Defendant II is appropriate for the protection of the rights of the Plaintiff, as based on this, Defendant I shall conduct the administrative proceeding and select the winner by applying tendering terms in correspondence with the legal provisions [...]\n\n*Sl\u00e1ger v ORTT* Metropolitan Court, 19 January 2010, (CA-11), 21, 33.\n\n*Sl\u00e1ger v ORTT* Metropolitan Court, 19 January 2010, (CA-11), 22.\n\n190.\n\nThe Court of Appeals took the same view, holding that the plaintiff had a \u2018direct interest' which was the \u2018competition with equal chances for all participants' constituted by the Media Law and the GTT. Such a right was limited to a declaration of the violation of the rules of the tender procedure and the nullity of any agreement concluded in breach of those rules. The plaintiff was held to have no \u2018substantive right for the conclusion of the agreement.'308\n\nMetropolitan Court of Appeals, 14 July 2010, (CA-14), 25.\n\n191.\n\nThere is no trace in the judgments of either the Metropolitan Court or the Court of Appeals of a finding that Hungarian law treats all rights other than inherent rights as proprietary, nor of any reference to the provisions of the Civil Code dealing with ownership of property. Rather, the Courts proceed on the basis that the participant in a public tender has a lawful interest in securing compliance with the provisions of the law and the terms of the tender. This is actionable by way of declaratory relief through the Civil Courts by virtue of the general provision of Article 2(1) (which refers to \u2018the lawful interests of all persons') and the confirmation in Article 7(1) that the right to vindicate such an interest applies equally to the obligations of government agencies \u2018to protect the rights provided by law.' These findings are consistent with the view already arrived at by the Tribunal in construction of the Civil Code, namely that it protects a broad range of legal rights, including contractual rights, but that not all of these constitute property rights.\n\n192.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that the category of proprietary rights under Hungarian law is undoubtedly broad enough to include intangible assets as well as movable and immovable property *stricto sensu*, it is nevertheless an essential attribute of a proprietary right that it be an asset capable of ownership, valuation and alienation.\n\n**F. Alleged sources of Claimants' proprietary rights**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nClaimants allege two sources of proprietary rights:\n\n(a) Rights in respect of the 2009 tender acquired by them in or under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement309; and\n\n(b) Rights acquired by them by virtue of their participation as a bidder in the 2009 Tender Bid.\n\nIt is necessary to analyse each of these sources of rights separately.\n\nDated 18 November 1997, (C-115).\n\n***1. 1997 Broadcasting Agreement***\n------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the Broadcasting Right created by the Broadcasting Agreement was a \u2018right representing assets' and therefore protected by the Hungarian law of property.310 In this connection, and as noted above, both Parties accept that Claimants had an investment by way of its shares in Sl\u00e1ger R\u00e1di\u00f3 for 12 years from 1997 until 18 November 2009, which qualified for protection under the Treaties.311 The issue in the present case is a more specific one: what proprietary rights, if any, did Claimants acquire thereby in respect of any period after 18 November 2009?\n\nKormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II, [17].\n\nSee above, [155].\n\n195.\n\nClaimants put their case in this regard in two ways:\n\n*First,* they say generally that the Broadcasting Agreement contained or incorporated valuable provisions for Claimants' benefit in relation to the subsequent period, notably the right to a subsequent tender in accordance with the provisions of the GTT; and,\n\n*Second,* they claim that, by virtue of the incorporation of the GTT into the Broadcasting Agreement, they obtained in particular the right to an \u2018incumbent advantage' on any subsequent tender, which was a valuable asset of a proprietary character, which was taken from them by the manner in which the ORTT, as a Hungarian state agency, operated the 2009 Tender.\n\n196.\n\nIn order to assess this claim, it is necessary for the Tribunal to construe first the duration of the Broadcasting Agreement. Section 2.3 provides:\n\nThe Broadcasting License shall commence from the 18th day of November, 1997 and is issued for seven (7) years, subject to the provisions of the present Contract. For the renewal of the Broadcasting License, \u00a7107 of the Act shall be applicable.\n\nThere are no other express provisions in 1997 Agreement as to renewal or the grant of further broadcasting licences thereafter.\n\n197.\n\nSection 107 of the Media Law, to which reference is made in section 2.3, provides:\n\n(1) Broadcasting rights for television are valid for maximum ten years, and rights for radio for maximum seven years, and may be renewed once upon expiry at the broadcaster's request, without inviting a tender, for an additional five years. The request for renewal must be notified to the Board fourteen months prior to expiry.\n\n(2) In the absence of the reporting notification referred to in Subsection (1) or if renewal cannot be awarded, the Board must publish an invitation to tender twelve months prior to the expiry of the license.\n\n(3) The license cannot be renewed if the right-holder violated the contract repeatedly or seriously.\n\n(4) The provisions relating to the award of rights must otherwise apply to the procedure for the renewal of such rights.\n\n198.\n\nTaken together the provisions of the Broadcasting Agreement and of section 107 of the Media Law provide a clear structure as to the term of the radio broadcasting right granted by the Broadcasting Agreement:\n\n(a) The licensee obtains an initial term of seven years (in the present case from 18 November 1997 to 18 November 2004); and,\n\n(b) Provided it has not violated the licence repeatedly or seriously, the licensee may request a further five year extension, which ORTT may grant without inviting a tender, provided that the request is made within the time specified, i.e. fourteen months prior to expiry. In the present case, it is common ground that this request for an extension was made and granted, thus extending the licence to 18 November 2009.312\n\n*See* Composition Agreement between ORTT and Sl\u00e1ger, 5 December 2002, (C-117).\n\n199.\n\nThus far, there is no dispute between the Parties. But the experts on Hungarian law whose reports were filed on behalf of each Party disagree as to the precise effect of section 107 of the Media Law within the Broadcasting Agreement upon any subsequent tender for the period after 18 November 2009.313 There are two sub-issues on which this disagreement centres:\n\n(a) Whether the Broadcasting Agreement confers rights upon Claimants binding in contract upon ORTT derived from the Media Law (and, in turn, from the GTT promulgated thereunder); and,\n\n(b) Whether section 107(2) in particular confers a right to renewal or re-tender 12 months prior to the expiry of the maximum twelve-year period under section 107(1) in respect of any subsequent period.\n\nExpert Legal Opinion of Dr P\u00e9ter Moln\u00e1r dated 22 April 2013, (**Moln\u00e1r I**), [27]; Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I, [32] - [41]; Moln\u00e1r II, [20]; Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II, [21] - [23]; Moln\u00e1r III, [23] - [28].\n\n*(a)*  *Contractual incorporation of the Media Law*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nDr Moln\u00e1r, the expert called on behalf of Claimants, maintains that \"[t]he 1997 Broadcasting Agreement incorporated the regulatory framework governing Sl\u00e1ger's broadcasting right, including the Media Law and the GTT and the 1997 Call for Tender.\"314 He relies for this purpose in particular on section 3.2 of the Broadcasting Agreement, which (in the agreed translation of the Parties) provides:\n\nThe Broadcaster undertakes to observe the provisions of the Act. The parties hereby incorporate into the present Contract the provisions of the Act relating to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise in effect at the time of the conclusion of the Contract. The Broadcaster hereby expressly agrees to use the Broadcasting Right during the full term of its validity in accordance with the provisions of the Act incorporated into the Contract, whether they are repeated herein or not.\n\nMoln\u00e1r I, [24]; Moln\u00e1r II, [20] - [22]; Moln\u00e1r III, [29] - [38].\n\n201.\n\nDr Moln\u00e1r opines that the reference in this provision to \u2018the provisions of the Act relating to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise' are a reference to the provisions of Chapters II and VI of the Media Law, which deal respectively with 'Principles and rules of broadcasting' and 'Broadcasting Rights'.\n\n202.\n\nDrs K\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes and Lengyel, Respondent's experts, disagree. They maintain that section 3.2 \u2018does not incorporate the provisions of the 1996 Media Law except to impose obligations of compliance *upon the broadcaster.* '315 Further, they opine that ORTT was not competent to give a commitment to leave the Media Law unchanged during the term of the Agreement.316 That was a question for Parliament and not the regulatory agency.\n\nK\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I, [52(a)].\n\n*Ibid*, [52(c)]; K\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II, [26].\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the effect of section 3.2 was, as its terms provide, to \u2018incorporate into the present Contract the provisions of the Act relating to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise in effect at the time of the conclusion of the Contract.' The effect of incorporation is that the provisions referred to become terms of the Contract between the Parties, just as if they had been written out in full. No doubt one consequence of such incorporation was to impose obligations upon the broadcaster. Yet it is too narrow a reading of the section to limit its effect in this way. That is not what the plain words of the quoted sentence provide. Moreover, such a limited unilateral effect would have been unnecessary. Hungarian law bound Sl\u00e1ger in any event in its performance of the Broadcasting Right. Rather, the effect of section 3.2 was to give bilateral *contractual* effect to the incorporated statutory provisions.\n\n204.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that this was beyond ORTT's competence. The provision did not bind the Hungarian Parliament in a manner that precluded subsequent amendments to the Media Law during the pendency of the Licence. Rather, it merely ensured that, as between Sl\u00e1ger and ORTT, the contractual framework was stabilised as at the time of the conclusion of the Contract. Hungarian law makes specific provision for the effect of any subsequent changes in the law upon parties' contractual rights and duties. Section 226(2) of the Civil Code provides (in a manner that is unexceptional in the Civil Law):\n\nLegal regulations can amend the content of contracts that have been concluded prior to the date on which the legal regulations enter into force only under special circumstances. If the amended content of a contract injures any substantial and rightful interest of any of the parties, the party so affected shall be entitled to request the court to amend the contract, or, unless otherwise provided by legal regulation, the party shall be entitled to rescind from the contract.\n\n205.\n\nThe effect, then, of such incorporation in the present case is that the provisions of Chapter VI of the Media Law, which relate to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise, form contractual terms of the Broadcasting Agreement. Chapter VI includes provisions relating to the publication by ORTT of both General Tender Conditions317 and Invitations to Tender,318 as well as the term of rights provision (section 107).\n\nTitle 3, sub-section 91 - 94.\n\nTitle 4, sub-section 95 - 102.\n\n206.\n\nBut the fact that these provisions form part of the Broadcasting Agreement during its term does not in itself address the second question, which is whether the Agreement contains obligations assumed by ORTT in respect of any period after 18 November 2009.\n\n*(b)*Application of Broadcasting Agreement to period after 18 November 2009\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties on the application of the Agreement to the period after 18 November 2009 hinges on the proper construction of section 107(2) of the Media Law. The question is whether this section imposes upon the ORTT an obligation to issue a further call for tenders twelve months before the end of the maximum period of twelve years of the Broadcasting Licence granted and renewed under section 107(1). If it does, Claimants submit that they were, by virtue of the incorporation of that section into the Broadcasting Agreement, *contractually* entitled to the conduct of a further tender in 2009 upon the same terms as applied in 1997. If it does not, then Claimants' contractual rights under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement would cease on 18 November 2009. Any rights Claimants might then have in respect of the 2009 Tender would have to be derived from another source.\n\n208.\n\nDr Moln\u00e1r states in his first report that section 107 contemplates two types of renewals: (a) that provided under section 107(1) (a renewal without re-tender for an additional five years) and (b) \"where the first type of renewal was already awarded, or \u2018cannot be awarded' a renewal conducted through a tender published by ORTT 12 months before the expiration of the broadcasting agreement (Section 107(2)).\"319 Thus, he considers that section 107 applies not only to the \"singular permitted renewal of broadcasting rights without tender\"320 but also \"to the retendering of the existing broadcasting right by holding a competitive tender, and signing a new contract with the winner.\"321\n\nMoln\u00e1r I, [27].\n\nMoln\u00e1r II, [26].\n\n*Ibid*, [27].\n\n209.\n\nDrs K\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes and Lengyel disagree. They opine that section 107(2) only applies to circumstances in which the first renewal is not sought or granted. At the end of maximum twelve-year period, they argue that the ORTT had a complete discretion as to whether to call a tender at all.322 If it did so, then the applicable provision of the Media Law would be section 41 (the general power of the Board to call for tenders for radio frequencies) and not section 107(2). Dr Moln\u00e1r accepts in reply that section 41 serves as the legal basis for the call for tenders, but maintains that section 107(2) complements section 41 because it \u2018regulates the timing but does not affect the statutory basis for calling the tender itself.'323\n\nK\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I, [42] - [45]\n\nMoln\u00e1r III, [26].\n\n210.\n\nThe experts called by both Parties referred to discussions within the ORTT Board and to ORTT practice in support of their respective positions, drawing opposing conclusions from this practice. But, in the end, the Tribunal finds that this question is simply a question of construction of the statutory provision. That is to say: it is a question of law that the Tribunal must decide.\n\n211.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, section 107(2) does not apply in respect of a period beyond the maximum licence period of twelve years provided under section 107(1). It does not in particular impose an obligation upon the ORTT Board to issue a call for tenders twelve months prior to the expiry of the twelve-year period. Rather, section 107(2) makes provision only for the position in the event that there is to be no renewal after the first seven years of a broadcasting licence. This may be so, *either* because the licencee has failed to notify the Board fourteen months prior to the expiry of the first seven year period that it seeks a renewal under sub-section (1); *or* because it has failed to meet the conditions for renewal by repeated or serious violations of the contract under sub-section (3). In either or those events, the Board is under an obligation under sub-section (2) to publish an invitation to tender twelve months before the expiry of the first licence period. Such a call for tenders would have to be issued at the outset of Year 7 in respect of the period from the beginning of Year 8.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to read section 107(2) as having any application to a situation in which the renewal provided under section 107(1) has been already granted without tender and the period under contemplation is therefore beyond the maximum twelve-years there provided. Section 107 is the only section in Title 7 of the Media Law which is entitled \u2018Term of Rights'. The section is by its express terms concerned with specifying maximum periods for which Broadcasting Rights are valid. Section 107(1) provides for only one renewal beyond the first maximum period of seven years. That renewal is to be for a period of five years. In its express terms, the Broadcasting Agreement is consistent with the law.\n\n213.\n\nDr Moln\u00e1r had originally maintained that a new call for tenders in respect of a period beyond twelve years is nevertheless a \u2018type of renewal'. But this is not consistent with the language of section 107(2), which speaks rather of \u2018an invitation to tender' which must be published \u2018if renewal cannot be awarded'.324 Section 107(2) does not create a different type of renewal to that provided under section 107(1). In his Third Report, Dr Moln\u00e1r retreated somewhat from his original formulation, maintaining simply that section 107(2) continued to impose an obligation upon the Board to issue a new call for tenders in respect of the period after twelve years.325 The Tribunal considers that this gives a construction to the words \u2018if a renewal cannot be awarded' which is inconsistent with the function of sub-section (2) within the structure of section 107. As it has already explained, this function is to provide for the situation at the end of the first seven-year period in the event that the single renewal right is not applicable.\n\nMoln\u00e1r II, [27].\n\nMoln\u00e1r III, [26].\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal is fortified in this view by a consideration of the consequences that would apply in the event that Claimants' construction of the section were to be applied. Claimants maintain that the obligation to issue a call for tenders in 2009 must be exercised on the basis of the Contractual Framework applicable to the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, including by incorporation the Media Law, GTT and CFT in force in 1997. The Tribunal sought clarification of this point in the course of oral argument. The President asked counsel for Claimants the following question:326\n\nAs I understand the submission of the Claimant, the submission is that if the ORTT were to have amended the General Terms for Tender such that different terms applied in 2009 to those originally published in [199]7, Claimants' position is that Claimant would be entitled to relief contractually if those changes had any material effect on their position vis-\u00e0-vis the original GTT in 1997?\n\nMR. TRIANTAFILOU: Yes.\n\nPRESIDENT McLACHLAN: What would be the position then, again, in seven years thereafter? Would it still be the 1997 GTT that would apply to the Claimant?\n\nMR. TRIANTAFILOU: As we noted yesterday, I think this is, of course, a matter of fact. The question would be whether the new Broadcasting Agreement would effect a similar incorporation of the GTT in effect at the time of the 2009 Tender. So the '97 Broadcasting Agreement incorporated the GTT in effect at that time, but, of course, the new Broadcasting Agreement would have to effect a similar incorporation for the same GTT to apply in future tenders, and, in particular, most likely a re-tendering because after the seven years, there is a renewal pursuant to Section 107 of the Media Law.\n\nWe have observed that the draft Broadcasting Agreement annexed to the 2009 CFT contains an incorporation clause functionally identical to Section 3.2 of the \u201897 Agreement. So I guess this by a long way of saying that, in this case, the same GTT would remain in effect for purposes of the winning bidder of the 2009 Tender until 2021 when presumably its Broadcasting Agreement plus renewal would come to an end.\n\nT2/401/9 - 402/20.\n\n215.\n\nAlthough Claimants submitted in answer to the President's second question that the ORTT could promulgate a new GTT for the 2009 Tender, their answer to the first question necessarily entails that, in their view, the ORTT was contractually bound vis-\u00e0-vis Sl\u00e1ger by virtue of the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement to issue the Call for Tenders for the 2009 Tender on the same terms (including the same terms as to renewal) as that provided in 1997. Any failure to do so would expose ORTT to a claim for contractual remedies from Sl\u00e1ger. The result would be that due compliance by ORTT with its contractual obligations would result in a potentially perpetual obligation to renew on 1997 terms. The Tribunal does not consider that this is at all consistent with the limited term of the Broadcasting Right conferred by the Broadcasting Agreement and the Media Law.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal's view that the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement did not generally impose upon ORTT obligations in respect of the period after 18 November 2009 is corroborated by the Claimants' own contemporaneous views as expressed to the regulatory authorities both in the United States and in Hungary.\n\n217.\n\nThus, in filing disclosure forms with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on 12 May 2008, 8 May 2009 and October 9, 2009 (ten days after the deadline for submitting bids in the 2009 Tender), Emmis Corporation (the ultimate US holding company *of two* of the Claimants) stated:327\n\nBroadcast licenses in many foreign countries do not generally confer the same renewal expectancy as U.S. radio stations broadcast licenses. For instance, Hungarian broadcast law is silent as to the treatment of broadcast licenses after the expiration of the first license renewal period. While we believe we have reasonable prospects for securing additional extensions of our Hungarian broadcast licenses after the expiration of our first license renewal period in November 2009, we cannot assure that such extensions will be granted or that the terms and conditions of such extensions will not have a material adverse effect on our Hungarian operations.\n\n2008 Emmis Form 10-K, 12 May 2008, 17, (R-4); 2009 Emmis Form 10-K, 8 May 2009, 15, (R-49); 2009 Emmis Form 10-K/A, 9 October 2009, 15, (R-53).\n\n218.\n\nFurther, for accounting purposes Claimants did not attach a value to Sl\u00e1ger's broadcast licence after November 2009. On the contrary, Emmis Corporation confirmed in the same US SEC filings that:328\n\nThe Company has *definite-lived intangible assets* recorded that continue to be amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 142. These assets consist primarily of foreign broadcast licenses, trademarks, customer lists and non-compete agreements, all of which are amortized over the period of time the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the Company's future cash flows. *The cost of the broadcast license for Sl\u00e1ger Radio is being amortized over the five-year term of the license, which expires in November 2009.*\n\n2008 Emmis Form 10-K, 12 May 2008, 70, (R-4); 2009 Emmis Form 10-K, 8 May 2009, 66, (R-49); 2009 Emmis Form 10-K/A, 9 October 2009, 66, (R-53), both emphases added by the Tribunal. This approach is confirmed in the accounts of Sl\u00e1ger: Jonscher Report, [89].\n\n219.\n\nClaimants submit that these statements of prudent accounting policy should not be taken as any indication of Emmis' lack of commitment to long-term investment in the Hungarian radio market or lack of expectation of a long-term benefit from that investment.329 But the question for the Tribunal is a different one. It is whether the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement conferred rights that might constitute valuable intangible assets, capable of expropriation in respect of any period after 18 November 2009. Claimants' contemporaneous accounting treatment of the Broadcasting Right confirms that it was indeed a valuable asset during the period of the licence and its first renewal. But at the same time, both Emmis Corporation and Sl\u00e1ger attributed a nil value to that asset in respect of the period after 18 November 2009. This confirms the view that the Tribunal has arrived at as a result of its own analysis of the rights conferred by the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, interpreted in the light of the relevant provisions of Hungarian law.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [17] - [19] citing Smulyan II [10] - [13]; Rejoinder, [24] - [30], citing Third Witness Statement of Jeffrey H. Smulyan dated 25 November 2013, (**Smulyan III**); Third Witness Statement of Barbara Brill dated 25 November 2013, (**Brill III**), [14].\n\n220.\n\nMoreover Sl\u00e1ger took the same position when it urged the Hungarian Parliament in 2008 to amend the Media Law so as to provide for further renewal of its licence. It stated:330\n\nAs it is known, the broadcasting licenses of the two national commercial radio licenses will expire in the second half of 2009 based on the broadcasting agreements concluded with the [ORTT] in a manner that their extension is currently not possible based on the currently effective provisions of Act I of 1996 (\"Media Act\").\n\nLetter from Sl\u00e1ger to Chair of Parliamentary Media Committee, 10 September 2008, 1, (C-266).\n\n221.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that the 2007 Broadcasting Agreement conferred in general no rights in respect of the period after 18 November 2009 constituting valuable assets capable of expropriation. However, it remains to consider one specific right that Claimants submit they acquired by virtue of being awarded the Broadcasting Right under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement and which they submit constituted a valuable asset in the 2009 Tender Bid. That is the alleged right to an incumbent advantage. The question whether Claimants acquired this right must be considered in the next section of this Award.\n\n***2. Alleged right to an incumbent advantage***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nClaimants' right to an incumbent advantage is alleged to derive from section 65.3 of the GTT which provides:\n\n65.3.1 That bidder is advantaged, who has held a broadcasting right awarded in tender for the frequency forming the subject-matter of the call for tender, if it operates and broadcasts in accordance with its studio license and the Media Act.\n\n65.3.2 ORTT evaluates at a disadvantage the bidder who holds the broadcasting right for the frequency forming subject of the call for tenders but its operations are not in compliance with its studio license and the Media Act.\n\n223.\n\nAlthough much argument was devoted to the question whether the GTT was, or was not, incorporated into the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement, the Tribunal considers that this issue is not in the end dispositive of the issue before it. It has already found that the provisions of Chapter VI of the Media Law that relate to the Broadcasting Right and its exercise were incorporated into the Broadcasting Agreement. These provisions include the requirement upon the Board to publish general terms of tender.331\n\nSection 91.\n\n224.\n\nThere is no dispute that section 65.3 of the GTT did form part of the tender for the 1997 Broadcasting Right. Moreover the same provision was also included in the GTT for the 2009 Tender, since the GTT continued to apply to all tenders of broadcasting rights until the Media Law was replaced in 2010 and was specifically incorporated into the Call for Tenders for the 2009 Tender.332 Sl\u00e1ger did submit a bid in the 2009 Tender. It was undoubtedly the bidder \u2018who has held a broadcasting right awarded in tender for the frequency forming the subject-matter of the call for tender'.333 If, therefore, section 65.3 were applicable to the 2009 Tender, then Sl\u00e1ger would be the only bidder holding the advantage recognised under the section.\n\n2009 CFT, 20 July 2009, 1, (CA-6); Moln\u00e1r I, [23];\n\nSection 65.3.1 GTT.\n\n225.\n\nThus, Claimants' claim under this head does not depend solely upon their more general submissions about the continuance of the rights under the 1997 Broadcasting Agreement. Indeed the language of section 65.3.1 contemplates two distinct elements:\n\n(a) The participation of the bidder in a current bid; and,\n\n(b) The fact that this bidder had previously held a broadcasting right for the same frequency, which right had been awarded in tender.\n\nThe advantage contemplated by section 65.3.1 therefore derives from current participation and the prior holding of the right, not from a continuation of that right.\n\n226.\n\nRespondent devotes some effort towards submitting that, even if section 65.3 applied, ORTT would have been entitled to evaluate Sl\u00e1ger at a disadvantage under section 65.3.2. It submits that Sl\u00e1ger conducted its operations in ways that were not in compliance with the Media Law, and cites instances that it claims constituted repeated and serious breaches of the Law.334 But the Tribunal finds no evidence that such infringements of the Media Law as were committed by Sl\u00e1ger rose to a level of repeated or serious violations, such that it could be said to be conducting its operations generally in a manner that was not compliant with the Law. On the contrary, it accepts the evidence advanced by Claimants showing that ORTT as regulator had granted the renewal of Sl\u00e1ger's licence in 2004; had settled its subsequent differences with Sl\u00e1ger in 2007 and that it was not regarded as a delinquent operator in 2009.335\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, [80]; Reply, [82], citing Kormendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II, [70].\n\nSettlement Agreements dated: 5 December 2002, (C-117), & 15 September 2007, (R-41); ORTT Board Minutes, 23 September 2009, (C-42).\n\n227.\n\nBut this leaves the question whether Sl\u00e1ger was in fact entitled *ratione personae* to the incumbent advantage provided in section 65.3.1. The language of the section refers to a bidder who \u2018operates and broadcasts in accordance with its studio license and the Media Act.'336 It is undisputed that Sl\u00e1ger's Broadcasting Right was not a \u2018studio licence'. The question of construction of section 65.3.1 is therefore whether that provision applies:\n\n(a) only to tenders for the award of frequencies previously held by holders of studio licences; or,\n\n(b) generally to incumbent bidders on all frequencies, all of whom must comply with the Media Law. In that event the reference to studio licences would have to be regarded as \u2018a mere anachronism'.337\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nT1/243/16.\n\n228.\n\nNeither the GTT nor the Media Law defines \u2018studio licence'. But the experts on Hungarian law called by both Parties were agreed that this type of licence had been issued at a local or regional level during the period prior to the entry into force of the Media Law, either for a fixed term or with an indefinite duration.338\n\nMoln\u00e1r II, [35] - [40]; K\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I, [29] - [31].\n\n229.\n\nSpecific provision is made for the treatment of such pre-existing studio licences in section 146 of the Media Law, which provides:\n\n(1) The holders of studio licenses issued prior to the time of this Act entering into force for a fixed period may apply to the Board for the transformation of their licenses into broadcasting contracts by 31 March 1996. Failure to observe this deadline shall result in the forfeiture of the right and the license shall be considered withdrawn. The Board may not conclude a contract with the applicant if the studio does not perform broadcasting or does not perform broadcasting in compliance with the studio license. The studio license shall be withdrawn by resolution of the Board.\n\n(2) The Board shall conclude the contract with the applicant for the term of the studio license defined in the original license and in respect of the area of reception defined therein, establishing the broadcasting fee, if the applicant operates in accordance with the provisions contained in the studio license.\n\n(3) The Board shall invite a tender in respect of the frequency (transmission time) released through the withdrawal of a studio license, except if the broadcaster refuses to consent under Subsection (3) of Section 100.\n\n(4) Tenders shall be invited in respect of the utilization in accordance with this Act of the frequencies used on the basis of the studio licenses issued prior to the time of this Act entering into force for an indefinite period of time or with reference to the time limit defined in this Act. The Board shall invite tenders in respect of the frequencies used on the basis of studio licenses issued with reference to the time limit defined in this Act within nine months, while in respect of the frequencies used on the basis of studio licenses issued for an indefinite period of time after one year, but within one-and-a-half years, at the most. These deadlines shall be reckoned as of the time of this Act entering into force. The studio licenses shall terminate at the date of the commencement of broadcasting services provided on the basis of the broadcasting contract concluded on the basis of the tender, at the latest.\n\n(5) In the tenders defined in Subsections (3)-(4), the former operation of the person entitled to broadcast on the basis of the studio license on the same frequency shall be given priority in the course of the assessment process.\n\n(6) The Board may conclude contracts with the companies existing at the time of this Act entering into force without complying with the provisions contained in Sections 85-88, Section 108 and Chapter VIII of this Act, subject to the condition to alter their activity or transform their companies by 31 December 1996.\n\n230.\n\nThe transitional regime set out in section 146 makes provision for two different types of studio licence:\n\n(a) *Fixed Period:* The holders of fixed term studio licences could apply to the Board within the stipulated window for the transformation of their studio licence into a broadcasting contract of the same duration, provided that they were broadcasting in compliance with their existing licence: section 146(1) - (2);\n\n(b) *Indefinite Period:* The holders of indefinite term licences had to submit to a retender within a stipulated period, but would \u2018be given priority in the course of the assessment process': section 146(4) - (5).\n\n231.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, section 65.3 of the GTT can only be read as the ORTT's implementation of the requirements of section 146 of the Media Law. The \u2018advantage' accorded to a bidder under section 65.3.1 of the GTT implements the requirement in section 146(5) of the Law to give that bidder \u2018priority'. Claimants' expert opines that there is no necessary link between the two provisions, pointing out that there is no equivalent in the Media Law of section 65.3.2 in the case of the holders of studio licences of indefinite duration.339 But, in the Tribunal's view, this observation in no way affects the close relationship between the two provisions. The right to transform fixed-term studio licences into broadcasting contracts without tender under section 146(1) had to be subject to an express qualification in cases where the incumbent had not complied with the terms of the studio licence. Otherwise a delinquent incumbent could unjustly benefit from rights under the new Law. But, in the case of a tender for an indefinite-term licence, section 146(3) makes it clear that the incumbent must submit to a tender process under the Board's tender conditions, which had yet to be promulgated. The requirement to accord the incumbent \u2018priority' could not preclude the Board from promulgating tender conditions that enabled it to take into account the question whether the incumbent had in fact operated in accordance with its studio licence and the Law.\n\nMoln\u00e1r II, [44].\n\n232.\n\nClaimants further submit that in practice the ORTT did accord an incumbent advantage in new tenders of local or regional frequencies,340 although the experts disagreed as to the significance of this practice.341 The Tribunal derives little assistance from this evidence, since its function is to construe and apply the applicable legal provisions, a task that is not determined by the practice of the regulator.\n\nRelying on Moln\u00e1r I, [45]; Moln\u00e1r III, [56] - [57].\n\nCf. K\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel I, [59]; K\u00f4rmendy-\u00c9kes/Lengyel II, [64].\n\n233.\n\nThe Board was empowered under section 91 of the Media Law to publish the GTT, defining, under sub-section (2)(b) criteria for evaluation of the material conditions of the bid. Although by section 92 the Board could have promulgated a different GTT for each of local, regional and national broadcasting, in fact it did not. The GTT, as adopted, applied across these different categories of broadcasting. But this does not mean that every provision in the GTT must be applied in the case of every bid if the particular provision is, by its terms, inapplicable to the bid in question.\n\n234.\n\nSection 65.1 of the GTT permits the contracting authority to evaluate the bids according to the criteria published in the Call for Tenders. The ORTT published the Call for Tenders in respect of the 2009 Tender on 29 July 2009.342 That Call accorded 10 points for Broadcasting Experience, but stated expressly that \"[i]n evaluating the Broadcasting Service Experience, it can not be regarded as a disadvantage if the Bidder has non-national broadcasting service experience.\"343\n\n2009 CFT, 20 July 2009, (CA-6).\n\n*Ibid*, [3.4.3.1.3].\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal's view, as a matter of law, that ORTT was not obliged to accord an incumbent advantage to bidders outside the specific context of holders of studio licence is reinforced by the conduct of Sl\u00e1ger and the conclusions of the Hungarian courts at the time.\n\n236.\n\nIn its comments on the draft Call for Tenders, Sl\u00e1ger made no reference to an incumbent advantage under section 65.3.1. It confined itself to a general observation that the draft made no distinction based on whether the broadcaster had demonstrated a long-term commitment in the Hungarian market. In reply, ORTT had stated that:344\n\nObserving the principles of neutrality of competition and equality of chances, and in line with media policy considerations [ORTT] did not wish to favor either old or new actors in the course of evaluating the bids.\n\nORTT Proposal 799/2009, 14 July 2009, (C-204), 34.\n\n237.\n\nSl\u00e1ger had previously sought to secure an extension to its licence by promoting an amendment to the Media Law in Parliament. On 30 July 2009, the Hungarian Constitutional Court delivered its judgment declaring unconstitutional the amending legislation of the Hungarian Parliament that would have extended Sl\u00e1ger's licence without re-tender.345 The Court held:346\n\nFrequencies are, at present, public goods of high value and importance, the owner of which is the state. [...] Because the number of frequencies reserved for transmission limits the entry into the market, new players on the media market bidding for frequencies are unable to enter the market in addition to those already on the market. They can only replace those on the market. Therefore, in a tender for analogue radio broadcasting right, the freedom of competition can be interpreted such that until radio digitalization takes place, all privately-held, profit-oriented undertakings must have an equal chance to bid for the two national commercial radio frequencies if they comply with the conditions set forth in the call for tender.\n\n*Supra* [34]; Constitutional Court Decision No. 71/2009, AB, July 2009, (CA-102/R-50).\n\n*Ibid*, 5.\n\n238.\n\nAfter the outcome of the bid had been announced, Sl\u00e1ger challenged the decision before the Hungarian Metropolitan Court *inter alia* on the basis of section 65.3. It argued that the ORTT should have excluded non-national broadcasting experience. But the Court rejected that argument, holding that, whilst section 65.3 was a mandatory part of the GTT, the ORTT was entitled under section 65.2 to formulate other criteria and thus the extension to non-national broadcasting experience was not a breach of the Media Law or the GTT.347\n\n*Sl\u00e1ger v ORTT* Metropolitan Court, 19 January 2010, (CA-11), 30; Metropolitan Court of Appeals, 14 July 2010, (CA-14), 30.\n\n239.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimants' disclosures in the United States and their conduct in Hungary prior to the Tender are consistent with the view that they knew that they did not have an incumbent advantage in the 2009 Tender. On the contrary, an extension of their licence without re-tendering by amendment to the Media Law had failed in the Constitutional Court on the basis that it would undercut the basic objective of ensuring equality of treatment as between incumbents and new bidders.348\n\nClaimants do not seek to challenge the Constitutional Court decision in their pleadings.\n\n240.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that the provisions of section 65.3.1 of the GTT did not apply to Sl\u00e1ger in its bid in the 2009 Tender for a national radio frequency. The Tribunal therefore does not need to decide whether the advantage set forth in that section is capable of being treated as an asset of the incumbent constituting property capable of expropriation.\n\n241.\n\nNevertheless, Claimants do not put their claim of expropriation solely on the basis of the alleged failure to apply the incumbent advantage. They also allege that, by participating in the 2009 Tender Bid, Claimants acquired other rights of a kind capable of expropriation. It is to this alternative basis for the claim that the Tribunal must finally turn.\n\n***3. 2009 Tender Bid***\n------------------------\n\n242.\n\nClaimants submit that, by virtue of its participation in the 2009 Tender, Sl\u00e1ger acquired the following four additional rights:349\n\n(a) The right to a properly established tender procedure;\n\n(b) The right to a timely tender;\n\n(c) The right to a fair and objective tender evaluation in accordance with transparent scoring criteria; and,\n\n(d) The right not to compete against unqualified or improperly qualified bidders.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [120] - [134]; Moln\u00e1r II, [64] - [87]; Rejoinder, [100] - [109].\n\n243.\n\nClaimants submit that these rights vested in Sl\u00e1ger by virtue of its participation in the Tender. They constituted a contract between Sl\u00e1ger and the ORTT.350 Had these rights been respected, Sl\u00e1ger would have been entitled to be declared the winning bidder (because, on the facts of the case, in Claimants' view it would have been the only qualifying bidder) and thus would have been entitled to the award of the 2009 Broadcasting Agreement.351 These rights were violated by ORTT in their evaluation of the bids in a manner that extinguished the rights, and accordingly these rights were expropriated.352\n\nT2/473/11 - 17.\n\nRejoinder, [8].\n\nT1/261/17 - 164/17.\n\n244.\n\nAt this jurisdictional stage of its enquiry, the Tribunal is not of course concerned to determine whether Respondent's conduct breached the applicable standards. In respect of breach, it is sufficient for Claimants to allege a *prima facie* case on the merits. Rather, the Tribunal is concerned with a prior question, which must be decided as a question of jurisdiction. That is whether the rights alleged constitute assets or property of the Claimants that are capable of being expropriated.353\n\n*Supra* [148].\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal finds as a matter of Hungarian law, that, in issuing the Call for Tenders, ORTT was obliged vis-\u00e0-vis all bidders to observe the conditions of the GTT as regards the tender procedure. The Call for Tenders provided that:354\n\nThe rules of the Media Act and the GTT must be applied to the tender procedure carried out on the basis of the Call for Tenders. The definitions and requirements used in the Call for Tenders must be interpreted in accordance with the Media Act and the GTT.\n\nThe Metropolitan Court held, in its decision of 19 January 2010 in the *Sl\u00e1ger* case, that:355\n\nThis means that the General Terms of Tender is part of the calls for tender for the individual broadcasting rights by virtue of the Act, its rules are mandatory and can only be deviated from if the Act or the GTT expressly permit.\n\n2009 CFT, 20 July 2009, (CA-6), section 1.3.1.\n\n*Sl\u00e1ger v ORTT* Metropolitan Court, 19 January 2010, (CA-11), 24.\n\n246.\n\nThe GTT therefore contained obligations that were binding on the ORTT as well as on the bidders. The Hungarian Court of Appeal so held in the *Klubradio* case on 12 July 2012, rejecting the submission of the ORTT that the GTT only constituted administrative directions:356\n\nThe statement made by the Defendant in the Appeal according to which the Call for Tenders and GTT represented procedures adopted only on the basis of a statutory authorization and formed a set of execution rules which, contrary to the provisions of the law containing the contracting option, could not create any imperative, cannot be accepted. The Defendant did not state either that the cited provisions of the Call for Tenders and GTT were in breach of the law and violated the Broadcasting Act, yet the rules of GTT and the Call for Tenders must be equally binding for the Caller of the Tender and the Bidders. Otherwise the principle stressed in the Defendant's Appeal with reference to the interest of the national economy would be violated, according to which frequencies managed by the State must be utilized in a fair and open competition.\n\nMetropolitan Court of Appeals Decision, 12 July 2012, (*Klubradio* Case), (CA-86).\n\n247.\n\nThe *Klubradio* case concerned a claimant who had been declared the winning bidder of a radio frequency following a tender procedure, who sought, successfully, to compel ORTT to enter into a broadcasting agreement. The claimant in that case had, therefore, already acquired the right to a valuable asset and sought to compel ORTT to deliver that asset to it.\n\n248.\n\nHowever, the present case is different, since here Sl\u00e1ger was not declared the winning bidder. Claimants contend rather that, had ORTT followed the proper procedures, it ought to have been declared to be the winning bidder. Thus Claimants' case requires the Tribunal to analyse the nature of the rights held by Sl\u00e1ger in the tender process prior to the declaration of the winning bid. Can such rights constitute proprietary assets of Sl\u00e1ger?\n\n249.\n\nIn view of the analysis as to applicable law already undertaken by the Tribunal above, it is necessary first to determine the character of those rights under Hungarian law. Some indication of the character of the rights is provided by the decisions of the Hungarian courts in the *Sl\u00e1ger* proceedings. The claim that Sl\u00e1ger advanced before the Metropolitan Court was that the ORTT had breached the fairness of the competition and the provisions of the Media Act, the GTT and the Call for Tenders. Accordingly Sl\u00e1ger was entitled to a declaration of unlawfulness, and injunctive relief.357 The Metropolitan Court accepted that a bidder could vindicate its rights to a proper tender before the civil courts.358\n\nStatement of Claim, 2 November 2009, (C-159), [69] - [81].\n\n*Sl\u00e1ger v ORTT* Metropolitan Court, 19 January 2010, (CA-11), 21 - 22.\n\n250.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that civil relief may be afforded to a bidder against the ORTT if the latter does not observe the tender conditions does not suffice to determine whether the bidder's rights are proprietary in character. In answer to a question from the Tribunal, Claimants confirmed that:359\n\nThe review of the civil courts of the conduct of the ORTT in question was and is limited in important respects. The Courts have held that they cannot second-guess the ORTT's decision-making process, such as the scoring of individual criteria, but they can and will review the formal compliance of the ORTT with the bid criteria.\n\nT2/479/8 - 14.\n\n251.\n\nThe overall purpose of the tender was, as the Supreme Court confirmed in its decision in the *Sl\u00e1ger* proceedings, \u2018to enable a competition *with equal chances* between the media-providers, also in respect of the frequency-tender.'360 Such a right is undoubtedly a very important one. It is of the essence of fair decision-making in a state governed according to law that individuals should be entitled to expect that a regulatory authority will comply with the legal framework applicable to it in exercising the regulatory powers conferred upon it. This is the essence of the complaint that Claimants raise in the present proceedings and in particular of the rights they allege under this head of their claim.\n\nSupreme Court of the Republic of Hungary, Judgment in Pfv.IV.21.976/2010/6, 23 February 2011 (*Sl\u00e1ger*), (CA-16), 12, emphasis added.\n\n252.\n\nBut the existence of such rights is not sufficient to answer the question whether this Tribunal had jurisdiction to vindicate such rights on the international plane. For that purpose, it is necessary to determine whether the rights constitute valuable proprietary assets of the Claimants. In line with the analysis already undertaken in Part VI E above the Tribunal is in no doubt that they do not.\n\n253.\n\n*In the first place,* the rights accorded to Sl\u00e1ger by virtue of its participation in the tender were also accorded to every other bidder. That follows necessarily from the fundamental purpose of the tender, confirmed by the Hungarian Constitutional Court, as enabling a competition with equal chances. It is perfectly possible to construe such a right as held by all if is it a right to due process, or, in the language of the Treaties, to \u2018fair and equitable treatment'.361 Such rights are, of their nature, designed to ensure that all persons affected by a governmental decision receive the equal protection of the law. But a property right is something quite different. It constitutes a right held by its owner to the exclusion of others. It is no answer to say that the rights acquired by bidders in the 2009 Tender were acquired for valuable consideration. That may have created a contractual relationship between each bidder and the ORTT. But each bidder did not thereby acquire a valuable asset, capable of being alienated. If that were so, it would mean that each bidder had, by virtue of its participation in the bid, acquired the same asset. But this makes no sense in the context of a tender, the very purpose of which is to determine which of a number of bidders is to acquire the asset in question, namely the 2009 Broadcasting Right.\n\nArt. 3(1) Netherlands BIT; Art. 4(2) Swiss BIT.\n\n254.\n\n*In the second place,* none of the rights alleged to arise directly from participation in the 2009 Tender could be said to be assets or property owned or controlled by Claimants. On the contrary, Sl\u00e1ger's rights in the 2009 Tender were rights concerning participation in a process that would determine whether it could acquire ownership of an asset. Such rights could not, in the words of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, be \u2018freely sold and bought, and thus ha[ve] a monetary value'.362 In the absence of this character, it is no answer to say that Sl\u00e1ger's rights arising from its participation in the 2009 Tender had a contractual as well as a regulatory basis. As the Tribunal in *Waste Management II* held: \u2018[n]on-compliance by a government with contractual obligations is not the same thing as, or equivalent or tantamount to, an expropriation.'363 The Tribunal has already considered, and rejected for the reasons set out in Part VI E above, Claimants' argument that all rights under the Civil Code other than inherent rights are to be regarded as proprietary. This accords neither with the structure and language of the Civil Code; nor with the expert evidence as to the nature of property under Hungarian law; nor with the fundamental notions of property embodied in the concept of expropriation at international law.\n\n*Amoco*, [108].\n\n*Waste Management II*, [175].\n\n255.\n\nIn the final analysis, the Tribunal is satisfied that the only proprietary right that Claimants had, capable of protection from expropriation, was the Broadcasting Right it acquired in 1997. That right was a right of limited duration. It expired on 18 November 2009. None of the ways in Claimants have sought to plead their case on the injustices that they allege were perpetrated upon them in the 2009 Tender meet the basic requirement of a property right. This being so, the Contracting States to the instruments of consent, namely the Netherlands and Switzerland BITs, have not conferred upon this Tribunal jurisdiction to determine Claimants' claims on the merits. Accordingly this Tribunal has no option but to dismiss Claimants' claims of expropriation as presently maintained in this arbitration for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n**G. Costs**\n------------\n\n256.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n[...] the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n257.\n\nIn accordance with the directions of the Tribunal at the Hearing, both Parties submitted written observations and schedules of costs on 31 January 2014. Respondent submits that, in the event that it were to succeed at the jurisdictional stage, it ought to receive its costs, particularly in view of what it characterises as its \"rational and good faith responses to the highly aggressive and inappropriate litigation tactics adopted by Claimants.\"364 Claimants, on the other hand, submit that, in the event that the Tribunal finds it does not have jurisdiction over all or part of the claim, it ought to order that each Party bear its own costs and contribute equally to the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Centre. It submits that \"[t]his is consistent with the prevailing practice of investment treaty arbitration tribunals when a legitimate claim has been alleged but dismissed, absent evidence of bad faith or misconduct on the part of the claimant or its counsel.\"365\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, [3].\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, [10].\n\n258.\n\nIt is clear from the *travaux* of the Convention that its framers intended to leave an arbitral tribunal with broad discretion as to how to apportion costs.366 Schreuer comments that:367\n\nIn the absence of reasons to decide otherwise, each party should bear half of the costs of the arbitration including the charges for the Centre's services and the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and should pay for its own expenses in preparing and presenting its case.\n\n*Documents concerning the Origin and Formulation of the ICSID Convention* (1968), II, 873, 898, 939, 993.\n\nSchreuer et al. *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn, 2009), (CA-162), 1236.\n\n259.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal considers that this is the proper order for costs. It does not accept Respondent's submission that Claimants adopted highly aggressive and dilatory litigation tactics. On the contrary, it finds that Claimants acted in good faith in bringing and prosecuting their claim for alleged breaches of the Treaties. Respondent could have consented to submit the wider dispute encompassing Claimants' non-expropriation claims to ICSID arbitration, a possibility specifically envisaged by Article 10 (2)(b) of the Switzerland BIT. Respondent however decided not to give its consent, as it was entitled to do. Respondent also insisted at the First Procedural Hearing that Claimants submit a full Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits before Respondent was required to indicate whether it intended to challenge the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Tribunal. This, too, was Respondent's right under the ICSID Rules. But it had the effect that Claimants were put to substantial cost in pleading to the merits, costs that are effectively thrown away.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that Claimants' subsequent prosecution of the action can be considered either aggressive or inappropriate. The withdrawal of Claimants' counsel from the record, and the need to appoint new counsel is not a step that can be laid at the door of Claimants. Both Parties approached their pleadings on Respondent's successive applications - its Rule 41(5) Objection, its application for bifurcation and its challenge to jurisdiction - in a manner that greatly assisted the Tribunal in its task.\n\n261.\n\nFinally, the present Award is in no sense a vindication of Respondent's position on the merits. On the contrary, the Tribunal's decision makes no finding, *prima facie* or otherwise, on the merits. Rather, the decision turns solely on the proper construction of the narrow basis for jurisdiction afforded to it by the Contracting Parties under the Treaties. The fact that the Tribunal has not been invested with jurisdiction to determine Claimants' claims beyond the claim for expropriation does not mean that those other claims are unfounded.\n\n262.\n\nFor all of the above reasons, the Tribunal has decided that the appropriate order for costs is that each Party should bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges of the Centre for the proceedings and that each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings.\n\n263.\n\nThe costs incurred by the Tribunal, the Centre and the Parties are set out below.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **US$** |\n| **Centre's administrative fees and expenses**368 | **87,846.13** |\n| **Tribunal's fees and expenses** | **243,421.19** |\n| **Claimants' fees and expenses** | **2,594,404.00** |\n| **Respondent's fees and expenses** | **1,866,421.00** |\n\nThe total costs of the proceeding as provided herein are actual as of the day of dispatch of the Award. It does not include the courier services expenses to be incurred for printing, binding and sending the certified copies of the Award as well as other related costs. Upon the financial closure of the case, ICSID will provide a detailed financial statement reflecting the final costs. Such statement will be notified to the Parties within 90 days from the date of dispatch of the Award.\n\n264.\n\nEach Party has in addition to date contributed US$250,000 by way of advances on costs to ICSID. This sum excluded from the table above.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n265.\n\n**For the above reasons, the Tribunal hereby renders this Award pursuant to which it:**\n\n**(1) Dismisses Claimants' claims of expropriation, which constitute their claims in these arbitral proceedings, for lack of jurisdiction;**\n\n**(2) Pursuant to its discretion under Article 61 of the ICSID Convention:**\n\n**(a) Orders each Party to bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges of the Centre for the proceedings; and**\n\n**(b) Orders that each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings.**"}]}
