Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 23, 2006, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received from Libananco Holdings Co. Limited (\"the Claimant\" or \"Libananco\"), a company incorporated in Cyprus, a request for arbitration, dated 23 February 2006 against the Republic of Turkey (\"Turkey\", \"the Republic\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n2.\n\nOn the same day, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"the Institution Rules\"), acknowledged receipt of the request and transmitted a copy to the Republic of Turkey and to its Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nThe request, as supplemented by the Claimant\u2019s letter of 13 March 2006, was registered by the Centre on 19 March 2006, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same day, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 7 of the Institution Rules, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 30 May 2006, the parties informed the Centre that they had agreed that the Claimant was to appoint an arbitrator on or before 18 June 2006; that the Respondent would appoint an arbitrator on or before 18 July 2006, and the parties would attempt to agree on an appointee for President of the Tribunal by 17 August 2006, failing which the appointment would be made by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n5.\n\nWithin the agreed deadlines, the Claimant appointed Mr. Henri Alvarez, a Canadian national, as arbitrator, and the Respondent appointed Sir Franklin Berman Q.C., a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. The Parties having failed to reach agreement as to the President of the Tribunal, by letter dated 21 August 2006, the Claimant requested that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appoint the President of the Tribunal. On 11 December 2006, after consulting the parties, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a national of Singapore, as the third and presiding arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Centre, by a letter of 18 December 2006, informed the Parties of the constitution of the Tribunal, consisting of Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, and Sir Franklin Berman Q.C., and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was, by agreement of the parties, held on 12 February 2007, at the offices of Respondent\u2019s counsel, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, in New York, the United States of America. Present at the session were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal:\n\n1. Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., President\n\n2. Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, Arbitrator\n\n3. Sir Franklin Berman Q.C., Arbitrator *(participating via videoconference)*\n\nICSID Secretariat:\n\n4. Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nAttending on behalf of the Claimant:\n\n5. Mr. Stuart Newberger, Crowell & Moring LLP\n\n6. Mr. Dana Contratto, Crowell & Moring LLP\n\n7. Mr. Alex de Gramont, Crowell & Moring LLP\n\n8. Ms. Brinkley Tappan, Crowell & Moring LLP\n\n9. Mr. Arif H. Ali, Crowell & Moring LLP\n\n10. Mr. Achilleas Demetriades, FIPRA Cyprus\n\nAttending on behalf of the Respondent:\n\n11. Ms. Lucy Reed, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP\n\n12.

Ms. Hande G\u00fcner, Interpreter, Enterkon\n\nCourt-Reporter:\n\n20. Mr. David Kasdan, B&B Reporters, Washington, D.C.\n\n8.\n\nVarious aspects of procedure were determined at the session, including a schedule for the submission of written pleadings.\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 August 2007, the Claimant filed a request for extension of time, from 13 August 2007 until 12 October 2007, to file its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits. It stated that its central expert witness had withdrawn from participation in this case following publication in a Turkish newspaper of an article indicating that persons associated with the Claimant, including its counsel, were under surveillance by Turkish security forces and reporting on a meeting between Claimant\u2019s counsel and one of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, and that the additional time was needed to prepare the statement of the replacement expert.1 By agreement of the parties, the Tribunal granted the requested extension and allowed the Respondent the same amount of additional time to file its own submission.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Extension of Time at 2, 1 Aug. 2007\n\n10.\n\nAlso on 1 August 2007, the Claimant filed its First Request for the Production of Documents, requesting the Tribunal to direct the Respondent to produce documents related to surveillance by the Respondent of the Claimant\u2019s potential witnesses and counsel.2 In its request, the Claimant submitted that the documents requested were relevant and material in that surveillance of counsel in the preparation of the Claimant\u2019s case violated generally accepted principles regarding the privilege which attaches to attorney-client communications and affected the Claimant\u2019s ability to prepare and present its case. The Claimant also submitted that it was entitled to know the extent to which its privileges and protections may have been violated and which of its communications had been subjected to surveillance.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents at 1-4, 1 Aug. 2007.\n\n11.\n\nOn 17 September 2007, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent filed its Response to the Claimant\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents. In its response, the Respondent advised that enquiries had been made of the relevant government departments (the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior and the Prime Ministry) and that all three entities had affirmed that no surveillance of the Claimant\u2019s counsel, or related to the present arbitration, had been (or was being) carried out.\n\n12.\n\nHaving requested and obtained leave to do so, the Claimant filed a reply on 19 November 2007. In its reply, the Claimant questioned the Respondent\u2019s statement that no surveillance of Claimant\u2019s counsel or related to the arbitration had been or was being carried out. However, the Claimant went on to state that it recognized that, from a practical perspective, the Tribunal could not order the Respondent to produce documents it said did not exist. The Claimant reserved its right to reinstate its Request and to request provisional measures ordering the Respondent to cease and desist from conducting surveillance should the Claimant discover that surveillance was being or had been carried out.\n\n13.\n\nFollowing the Claimant\u2019s Reply, the Tribunal, in a letter of 3 December 2007 to the parties, observed that the Claimant had effectively withdrawn its Request for the Production of Documents, and reserved costs in relation to the Request to be assessed together with the costs of the arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits was filed on 12 October 2007.\n\n15.\n\nOn 18 December 2007, the Respondent filed its First Request for the Production of Documents, as well as a Request for Security for Costs, accompanied by a letter requesting suspension of the proceeding, production of documents, and provisional measures.3 In the Request for Production of Documents, the Respondent requested production by the Claimant of documents relating to Libananco\u2019s acquisition and ownership of CEAS and Kepez shares, Libananco\u2019s actions as shareholder and Libananco\u2019s business activities. In the Request for Security for Costs, the Respondent applied for an order that the Claimant post security adequate to guarantee payment of any award of legal fees and other costs in the Republic\u2019s favor, in the amount of US$5 million, or alternatively such other amount as the Tribunal might deem appropriate.\n\nThe requests and the letter were filed with the Centre on 19 Dec. 2007.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 2 January 2008, the Tribunal requested the Claimant to file a reply to the Respondent\u2019s applications of 18 December 2007, by Friday, 11 January 2008. Subsequently, the Claimant requested an extension until 29 February 2007 to file the reply, and was granted an extension until 11 February 2008.\n\n17.\n\nIn its reply filed on 11 February 2008, the Claimant asked that the Tribunal deny the Respondent\u2019s document production request and Request for Security for Costs. It requested in turn, if Article 47 so permitted, an order requiring the Respondent to post security for costs.\n\n18.\n\nOn 25 February 2008, the Respondent filed a Reply to the Claimant\u2019s submission and in further support of its Request for Security for Costs.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 29 February 2008, the Claimant submitted an application in which it informed the Tribunal that it \"recently has learned of Turkish court orders requested and obtained by Respondent in 2007 and 2008, expressly to conduct intercepts of emails and MSN instant messages not only sent by and to persons associated with Claimant, but also approximately 1,000 privileged, private and confidential emails sent by, to and between Claimant\u2019s counsel of record in connection with this arbitration over the past year.\"4 The Claimant requested the Tribunal \"to rectify the otherwise irreparable effect of Respondent\u2019s actions on Claimant\u2019s ability to present its case... by determining its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the Energy Charter Treaty... and finding Respondent liable on the merits for its multiple breaches of the ECT and the protections and guarantees available to [the Claimant] under international and Turkish law,\"5 and by awarding costs associated with this arbitration \"in Claimant\u2019s favour as a sanction for Respondent\u2019s bad faith.\"6\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter to the Tribunal on 1, 29 Feb. 2008.\n\n*Id.* at 2.\n\n*Id. See also, id.* at 33.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent filed an initial reply on 3 March 2008 and, as directed by the Tribunal, a full reply on 19 March 2008. Thereafter, the Tribunal fixed 28 and 29 April 2008, in Washington, D.C., for an oral hearing of the various applications of the parties.\n\n21.\n\nIn its 19 March 2008 reply, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal deny the Claimant\u2019s application and order the Claimant \"to deposit its original shares certificates of QEA\u00a7 and Kepez for safekeeping.\"7 The Respondent also requested that it be awarded its costs for responding to Claimant\u2019s Application.8\n\nRespondent Response to Claimant\u2019s Application of 29 February 2008, at 25, 19 March 2008.\n\n*Id.* at 26.\n\n22.\n\nOn 25 March 2008, the Claimant filed a reply to the Respondent\u2019s Response, attaching new documents regarding surveillance, and maintaining that physical deposit of the requested share certificates was unnecessary.\n\n23.\n\nOn 31 March 2008, the Tribunal suspended the deadlines for the filing of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial on jurisdiction and merits and ruled that it would issue a fresh procedural timetable after fully reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions on the applications before it.\n\n24.\n\nOn 7 April 2008, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder Regarding the Claimant\u2019s Application of 29 February 2008, and restated the request for relief sought in its Response of 19 March 2008.\n\n25.\n\nOn 11 April 2008, as directed by the Tribunal, the parties filed summaries of their respective positions on the Claimant\u2019s application of 29 February 2008, the Respondent\u2019s application of 18 December 2007 for security for costs, and the Respondent\u2019s application of 18 December 2007 for the production of documents and the share certificates.\n\n26.\n\nThe hearing on the parties\u2019 applications was held on 28 and 29 April 2008, at the Headquarters of the World Bank in Washington, D.C.

The parties\u2019 positions with respect to the Respondent\u2019s first request for production of documents**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**II.1 Respondent\u2019s First Request for the Production of Documents filed 18 December\u00a0 2007**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Republic requests voluntary production of documents by Libananco, alternatively an order by the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 34(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules relating to Libananco\u2019s acquisition and ownership of CEAS and Kepez shares, Libananco\u2019s actions as shareholder and Libananco\u2019s business activities.\n\n29.\n\nThe position of the Republic is as follows.\n\n(a) Share ownership is in doubt given the competing claims in other (ICSID) proceedings adding up to ca. 200% of the shares issued by CEAS and Kepez.\n\n(b) Libananco did not meet its promise to produce evidence of share ownership in its Memorial.\n\n(c) There may not be an investment (Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention / Art. 1(6) ECT).\n\n**II.2 Claimant\u2019s Response to Respondent\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents filed 11 February 2008**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s response is as follows.\n\n(a) The Republic should not be allowed to make document requests until it has filed its objection to jurisdiction. Relevance of the requested documents cannot be assessed without a formal jurisdictional objection.\n\n(b) Libananco has produced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case, which remains unchallenged.\n\n(c) The Republic has not shown that it does not have the requested documents in its possession or custody (Art. 3(3)(c) IBA Rules).\n\n(d) Fairness requires that the Republic should not receive discovery on the issue of jurisdiction until it has actually made an objection.\n\n**III. Summary of parties\u2019 positions with respect to Respondent\u2019s security for costs Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**III. 1 Respondent\u2019s Security for Costs Application filed 18 December 2007**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Republic applies for an order that Libananco post U.S. $5 million as security for costs in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit or bank guarantee as a provisional measure under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n32.\n\nThe position of the Republic is as follows.\n\n(a) Security for costs would provisionally preserve the Republic\u2019s right to seek and enforce an award for costs, if it prevails in this arbitration. The hypothetical nature of the right is insufficient to refuse the request.\n\n(b) Libananco\u2019s share ownership is doubtful.\n\n(c) Libananco is a shell company without assets and has provided no undertaking to pay costs or evidence of its ability to do so.\n\n(d) Libananco\u2019s claim is financed by third parties.\n\n(e) A costs award against Libananco would be difficult to enforce owing to its seat in Cyprus.\n\n**III.2 Claimant\u2019s Response to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Security for costs filed 11 February 2008**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s response is as follows.\n\n(a) Security for costs is not ordinarily granted in ICSID proceedings and no exceptional circumstances exist.\n\n(b) A costs award is too hypothetical: there must be an existing right to be protected.\n\n(c) The allegations regarding Libananco\u2019s inability to pay are not specific enough to support a security for costs order.\n\n(d) Security for costs would entail unfairly pre-judging the merits and would affect Libananco\u2019s ability to present its case.\n\n(e) Generally, parties in ICSID proceedings bear their own costs.\n\n(f) Libananco\u2019s lack of resources is the direct result of the Republic\u2019s alleged expropriation.\n\n(g) Any limitations on the Republic to enforce an award in Cyprus are self-imposed and political in nature.\n\n**III.3 Respondent\u2019s Reply in Support of its Request for Security for Costs**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Tribunal should be able to recommend in certain circumstances the deposit of a guarantee aimed at protecting the Respondent against eventual non-payment of costs when the claimant is financially incapable.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent states that this is an exceptional case in which security for costs should be allowed because the Claimant is a shell company, deliberately incorporated in Cyprus to make it difficult to enforce any award, with a wealthy third party (\u2018the Third Party\u2019) funding the arbitration with no intention to pay any costs awards (\u2018arbitral hit and run\u2019). The Respondent argues that the Third Party and members of the Third Party have shown themselves to be fraudsters.\n\n36.\n\nEven Libananco has impliedly treated itself as synonymous with the Third Party since it takes the Prime Minister of Turkey\u2019s threat that \u2018[a member of the Third Party] will be left empty handed\u2019 to mean that the Respondent would not honour any damages award made in favour of the Claimant.\n\n37.\n\nLibananco has never filed any annual returns in Cyprus showing that it has any assets nor has it shown that it has adequate assets\n\n**III. 4 Libananco\u2019s response to the Respondent\u2019s Reply in support of the Respondent\u2019s Request for Security for Costs**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nLibananco takes the position that, in the event the Tribunal determined that security for costs could be awarded, then it was the Republic which should post security for costs since it had repeatedly stated that it would not honour an award against it in this arbitration\n\n**IV. Respondent\u2019s Suspension Application in Letters dated 18 December 2007, 19 February 2008 and 26 March 2008**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the \" *Tribunal suspend the proceedings in this arbitration until the Claimant has proven that it legitimately owns the CEAS and Kepez stock percentage it* *claims\".*\n\n40.\n\nBased on the document production application, the Republic intends to physically inspect the share certificates to determine their authenticity and the circumstances of their transfer. Once the Republic has had an appropriate time to examine all of the share certificates and related documents in the competing cases and clarify the ownership situation of CEAS and Kepez, it will provide a report to the Tribunal, which would be the basis for lifting the suspension.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant opposes any suspension of the proceedings.\n\n**V. Parties\u2019 position with respect to Claimant\u2019s Application for 'summary' relief**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**V.1 The Claimant\u2019s position as reflected in its letter dated 29 February 2008 (\u2018the surveillance application\u2019)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant first initiated its application for a unique form of relief (loosely termed \u2018summary\u2019 relief or \u2018summary judgment\u2019) in a letter dated 29 February 2008. As its position was later refined closer to the hearing in its summary of its position submitted on April 11, 2008, the latter will be taken as a supplement to the Claimant\u2019s application in its letter of 29 February 2008.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that the Respondent\u2019s conduct towards Claimant, its Counsel and its witnesses has made it impossible - indeed unsafe - to continue the prosecution of this case in its present form. The Respondent, through court-ordered intercepts, has had the opportunity to review nearly 2,000 privileged and/or confidential emails.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position in its letter of 29 February 2008 is as follows.\n\n(a) The Respondent falsely represented to the Tribunal and to the Claimant that it has not conducted and is not conducting surveillance of the Claimant\u2019s counsel in this arbitration.\n\n(b) The Claimant has irrefutable evidence of the Respondent\u2019s surveillance conducted by the Chief Public Prosecutor of Sisli (\u2018the Public Prosecutor of Sisli\u2019 or \u2018the Sisli Prosecutor\u2019) of privileged and confidential emails sent to and received from Claimant\u2019s counsel throughout 2007 and even in 2008.\n\n(c) The Respondent has violated the Energy Charter Treaty and the ICSID Convention by failing to arbitrate in good faith.\n\n(i) The ICSID Convention provides immunity from legal process for legal counsel in the exercise of their functions, including their correspondence in the course of the arbitration.\n\n(ii) Almost all of the emails accessed by Respondent were legally privileged.\n\n(iii) The Respondent has created an untenable situation in this arbitration by abusing its sovereign powers to gain an unfair procedural advantage.\n\n(d) The Tribunal has a fundamental duty to ensure procedural fairness of the arbitration and is required to restore a meaningful level of fairness to these proceedings by:\n\n(i) determining its jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dispute and find against the Respondent on the merits of the record before it;9 and\n\n(ii) awarding costs against the Respondent.\n\n(e) Any lesser remedies ordered by the Tribunal would not be sufficient to redress the irreparable harm caused by the Respondent\u2019s conduct.\n\nSubsequently, the Claimant clarified that it was asking the Tribunal to make a decision on the merits on the record as it currently stands\n\n**V.2 Respondent\u2019s Response to Claimant\u2019s Application 19 March 2008**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges the authenticity of the court orders but states that the investigation was and is not directed at the Libananco arbitration or Libananco\u2019s counsel but rather was for investigation of the laundering of the $16 billion that was lost in the Imar Bank fraud.\n\n46.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by police officers and kept confidential and no documents or information relating to this arbitration were provided to Respondent's counsel nor the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources which has instructed Respondent's counsel in this arbitration. The Claimant has not been prejudiced in any way by the unrelated surveillance. The Respondent also says that the relief sought by the Claimant would deprive it of the right to a fair opportunity to present its case.\n\n**V.3 Further responses by parties to Claimant\u2019s surveillance application**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIt is not necessary to repeat the detailed comments and arguments of the Parties which were conveniently summarized by way of written summaries submitted on 11 April 2008 following the Tribunal's directions.\n\n**V.4 Claimant\u2019s summary filed 11 April 2008**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimant alleges in its summary of position filed 11 April 2008 as follows.\n\n(a) It has undoubtedly been prejudiced as the Sisli Prosecutor has reviewed hundreds upon hundreds of emails sent to, by and between the Claimant\u2019s counsel during the course of this arbitration. The Sisli Prosecutor is a part of the Turkish Government, performs functions of a governmental nature, and is controlled by the Turkish Government. It is not \"independent\" of the rest of the Turkish Government. As a result, since it is clear under international law that the Republic of Turkey is a unified whole, it is the Respondent who has reviewed the Claimant\u2019s counsels\u2019 emails and it is that same Respondent that is a party to this arbitration.\n\n(b) The Respondent intended to prejudice, or knowingly prejudiced, the Claimant\u2019s rights in this arbitration by commencing the surveillance.\n\n(c) Regardless of the Respondent\u2019s intention, the effect of the Respondent\u2019s surveillance has been that the Claimant has been prejudiced in this arbitration.\n\n(d) The exclusion of the Respondent from this phase of the arbitration process is the only means for the tribunal to equalize the playing field. This is because the Tribunal must ensure that whatever action it takes is commensurate to remedy the harm that has been caused to the equality of arms between the parties. Where, as here, the harm caused by Respondent has been so absolute, the remedy too must be absolute. Otherwise, the equality will not have been restored and the Tribunal will not have fulfilled its mandate.\n\n**V.5 Respondent\u2019s summary of position filed 11 April 2008**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is as follows.\n\n(a) The criminal investigation is not and has never been aimed at the Libananco arbitration, much less at Libananco\u2019s counsel or potential witnesses for Libananco in the arbitration.\n\n(b) The statements in the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Letter of 6 September 2007 were accurate, namely that:\n\n(i) there was no *\"technical surveillance conducted by our Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office concerning any counsel in the ICSID case or any counsel representing either the Respondent or the Claimant in this case\",* and\n\n(ii) *\"there is no... interception of communication carried out by our Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in relation to the Parties or the counsel in the* *above-mentioned case.\"*\n\n(c) The Chief Public Prosecutor of Sisli was interested only in communications that contained references to asset transfers by the Third Party and its associates and attempts by the Third Party\u2019s associate to defraud the Public. Only in late September 2007 were two of Claimant\u2019s counsel identified and set out as users of the intercepted email addresses. The surveillance in support of this investigation was terminated on 14 March 2008 after it was disclosed by the Claimant, which alerted at least certain suspects.\n\n(d) The Claimant cannot demonstrate prejudice to its case.\n\n(i) Under Turkish law and the court confidentiality order, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office cannot disclose evidence or surveillance results to any other entity or agency in the Turkish government. This includes the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, which instructs the Republic\u2019s arbitration counsel.\n\n(ii) The Prosecutor\u2019s Office destroys e-mails irrelevant to the investigation, for example, any arbitration-related documents unconnected to possible third party asset transfers.\n\n(iii) The Republic\u2019s arbitration counsel have not received or used any intercepts or other surveillance results from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office in preparing any submission to the Tribunal (other than those filed in connection with the Application).\n\n(iv) The inference in the Republic\u2019s Security for Costs Application that Libananco was a shell and that this arbitration was being funded by the Third Party came from Libananco\u2019s own evidence submitted with its Memorial, and common sense and logic, not from the results of surveillance.\n\n(e) There has been no threat levelled against Claimant\u2019s counsel for its actions in this proceeding.\n\n(f) The relief the Claimant seeks is unprecedented and should be denied.\n\n**VI. Respondent\u2019s Request for Safe-Keeping of Shares dated 19 March 2008**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nIn its Response to Claimant\u2019s Application of 29 February 2008, the Republic requests that the Claimant deposit its share certificates in CEAS/Kepez for safe-keeping by the Tribunal.\n\n51.\n\nThe position of the Republic is as follows.\n\n(a) The share certificates are crucial to determining jurisdiction.\n\n(b) Given the competing claims in separate arbitration proceedings and the nature of the shares as bearer shares, steps must be taken prevent that the existence of an investment in each arbitration is proven by using the same set of share certificates several times.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimant has no objections to physical deposit of share certificates but maintains that there is no need to go to such trouble and expense as there are thousands of share certificates, (see Claimant\u2019s letter dated 25 March 2008).\n\n**VII. Discussion**\n-------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus confronted, at this preliminary stage in its procedure - that is to say, before it has seen the terms either of the Respondent\u2019s substantive defence to the Applicant\u2019s claims or of any preliminary objection that the Respondent may lodge to jurisdiction etc. - with the following competing applications; -\n\nfrom the Claimant :\n\n(i) for an order granting Claimant a form of summary judgment, if not on its substantive claims in full then at least on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear its substantive claims;\n\n(ii) for the inclusion in the procedure referred to under (iii) below of the shares in CEAS and Kepez alleged to have been removed from Claimant\u2019s offices at the time of the alleged expropriation of these companies;\n\nfrom the Respondent :\n\n(iii) for an order for the production of the original share certificates in CEAS and Kepez said to be the foundation of the Request for Arbitration, so as to permit them to be examined under controlled conditions by the Respondent\u2019s agents and representatives;10\n\n(iv) for an order for security for costs.\n\nIt should simply be noted, for precision, that this request is in fact the first of a lengthy list which together comprise the Respondent\u2019s First Request for the Production of Documents; but the remaining items on that list do not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, raise special issues, and they are dealt with en bloc in the orders below.\n\n54.\n\nBecause these applications, and in particular the factual circumstances that lie behind them, raise troubling and important issues, the implications of which may well go beyond the confines of this arbitration and impinge on the integrity of the ICSID arbitral process more generally, the Tribunal felt it necessary to schedule an oral hearing at the seat of the arbitration. That allowed it to hear full argument from both sides, and to pose questions of its own. Having done so, the Tribunal now thinks it desirable to set out in a reasoned Decision the basis for its Orders below (the terms of which have already been conveyed to the Parties shortly after the conclusion of the oral hearing).\n\n55.\n\nIt will be more convenient to take item (iv) first, followed by items (ii) & (iii) together, and then item (i).\n\n**VII. 1 Security for Costs**\n-----------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThis is the most straightforward of the applications, and can be dealt with briefly.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal is not aware of any established practice on the part of ICSID Tribunals in favour of granting security for costs either to a Claimant or to a Respondent. Asked during the oral hearing for its most favourable authority supporting the granting of security for costs, even by analogy, counsel for the Respondent was in some difficulty to name anything specific. In these circumstances, the Tribunal takes the view that it would only be in the most extreme case - one in which an essential interest of either Party stood in danger of irreparable damage - that the possibility of granting security for costs should be entertained at all.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that the present is such a case. The Respondent bases its request on the claim that the Claimant, Libananco, is a shell company without assets of its own, and is therefore unlikely to be able to meet an eventual award of costs against it should either its jurisdictional or its merits claims be rejected by the Tribunal in due course.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that argument convincing. The state of Libananco\u2019s assets is not at this stage the subject of proof, but of mere assertion and counterassertion. More important to the mind of the Tribunal is that, far from this being an unusual exception, it is in practice closer to the norm that the entity appearing as an ICSID Claimant is an investment vehicle created or adapted specially for the purpose of the investment transaction that has in the meanwhile become the subject of dispute. Nor, moreover, is it in fact standard practice for ICSID Tribunals invariably to make an award of costs against a losing Party. There is no express reference to such an award in the Convention itself, and Rule 47(l)(j) of the Arbitration Rules is cast in broad and flexible terms which in its application entails an exercise of discretion by the individual tribunal in the light of the particular circumstances of the dispute before it. The Tribunal can see no good reason to prejudge at this stage in these proceedings how it might in due course wish to exercise that discretion, the more so as it has not yet (see paragraph 53 above) been apprised of the terms of the Respondent\u2019s arguments on either jurisdiction or merits.\n\n60.\n\nThe application for security for costs is therefore rejected.\n\n**VII. 2 Production and Examination of Share Certificates**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThere are a number of unusual factors underlying the claims brought by Libananco against Turkey in these proceedings, which centre round the alleged expropriation of two Turkish power utilities, CEAS and Kepez. The investment which Libananco asserts has been subjected to treatment contrary to the standards laid down in the ECT is precisely its shareholdings in CEAS and Kepez. The value which Libananco puts upon these investment assets is of the order of USD 10 billion, a very substantial sum indeed by any reckoning.\n\n62.\n\nTurkey for its part - while not yet having taken a definitive position on the substance of the allegations concerning its treatment of CEAS and Kepez - casts doubt on whether Libananco is qualified to bring the Request for Arbitration at all, and wishes even at this early stage to put the genuineness of Libananco\u2019s ownership stake in CEAS and Kepez to a form of prior proof, on the basis that a defect in this respect might provide the ground for it to lodge a preliminary objection, presumably either to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or at least to the admissibility of Libananco\u2019s claims.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have to decide whether the Respondent is entitled as of right to a form of pre-pleading discovery of this kind (taking into account in particular, as recorded in the Minutes of the First Session, its decision that each Party would file a Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits, and that it would then be for the Tribunal to decide whether to divide the proceedings into two phases), since Libananco has consistently indicated that it is in fact willing to submit its share documents to inspection under suitable safeguards. As expressed during the oral hearing (Day 2, pp. 322 ff), Libananco put forward an eight-point proposal involving the appointment of an escrow agent, but conditioned that proposal on the Respondent\u2019s agreement to bring into the inspection arrangement on the same footing the share certificates alleged to be in its possession (see fuller description in [53(ii)]) above). For its part, the Respondent (Day 2, pp. 341 ff.) did not take express issue with the eight points as such, but drew the line at including in the arrangement shares physically held in Turkey. This was on the basis (substantively) that there was no claim before the Tribunal which depended on these shares, and (procedurally) that the shares which appeared to correspond to the request were in the custody of a bailee under the order of a Turkish Court.\n\n64.\n\nThat the share certificates lie at the very heart of these arbitral proceedings is clear. Their crucial characteristic for present purposes is, however, that they are bearer shares. In other words, ownership over them passes by mere physical transfer, and dealings in them are not recorded in any formal trading register. Moreover, they represent (see paragraph 61 above) an asset both of enormous value and of some fragility. In those circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the arrangements for their preservation and inspection are a matter requiring the greatest care, and the Tribunal has approached the matter accordingly.\n\n65.\n\nBuilding, therefore, on Libananco\u2019s eight-point proposal (paragraph 63 above), \u00a7 3.2 of the Orders below is designed to ensure that Libananco may safely offer up for inspection the share certificates it holds, and Turkey may inspect them strictly for the purposes of the present arbitration, in confidence that these valuable documents will be protected from harm, and that nothing in the process of delivery and inspection under this Order will affect in any way the substantive rights of either Party in connection with this arbitration. In particular: (a) although the escrow agent will be appointed by the Claimant (and will not be an agent of the Tribunal or of ICSID), the agent will take instructions exclusively from the Tribunal on anything that has to do with the holding of the share certificates; (b) the Tribunal assumes that, although the present somewhat special state of affairs was not expressly in the contemplation of the drafters of the ICSID Convention, the escrow agent will share in the immunities accorded by Article 22 of the Convention (read together with Article 21) in respect of any matter connected with the holding of the share certificates; (c) the specific provisions of \u00a7 3.2.6 are designed to reassure each Party that the other Party will not make use of the movement of the share certificates into and out of escrow to gain for itself any extraneous advantage.\n\n66.\n\nThese dispositions respond to the first prayer in the Respondent\u2019s First Request to Produce. The Tribunal sees no need to make them conditional on Turkey\u2019s including in the inspection arrangements the share certificates in CEAS and Kepez alleged by Libananco to have been seized by the Turkish Government (paragraph 63 above). In the first place, the Tribunal is not in receipt of any formal request for document disclosure to that effect from Libananco under the provisions of the Minutes of the Tribunal\u2019s First Session. In the second place, the Tribunal cannot at first blush see how Libananco\u2019s standing as Claimant in this arbitration is affected one way or the other by the existence or ownership of these shareholdings; on Libananco\u2019s case as set out in its Memorial on Merits and Jurisdiction of 12 October 2007, the shareholdings which it asserts are in its present possession would suffice for the establishment of standing, and such claims as there might be to further shares would go primarily to quantum (if its claims were to be upheld) not to the substance of Libananco\u2019s case itself.\n\n67.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal feels called upon to utter a further word of explanation, and of caution, as to why it has granted (to the extent specified) this prayer by Turkey.\n\n68.\n\nThe argument marshalled by Turkey, as Respondent, is essentially that it entertains justifiable doubts as to the genuineness of Libananco\u2019s shareholdings. In its original version, foreshadowed at the time of the Tribunal\u2019s First Session, this argument took the form of a generalized scepticism as to whether Libananco does in fact own the interests in CEAS and Kepez which it claims. More recently, however, the argument has developed into something more nuanced, namely that Turkey has reason to believe that the shareholdings, or at least parts of them, are being treated by more than one claimant entity as their own property, on the basis of which two other ICSID arbitrations have been commenced, the result being that, taken cumulatively, well over 100% of the shares in both CEAS and Kepez are being claimed in these various proceedings. As part of this line of argument, Turkey (the Respondent of course in all three arbitrations) has made the Tribunal privy to certain documents in the other two sets of proceedings.\n\n69.\n\nLibananco answers, simply, that it can prove its own shareholdings and is willing to do so, and that the (corporate) claimants in the other two arbitrations, and the interests lying behind them, have nothing to do with it.\n\n70.\n\nIt may be recalled that the Minutes of the First Session of the Tribunal record that the Claimant was to file a memorial on jurisdiction and merits, but not quantum, within six months and that the Respondent was to file its counter-memorial on jurisdiction and merits within a further six months thereafter. As there indicated, that decision was taken by the Tribunal after deliberation, following extensive oral submissions by the parties on their differing positions on the schedule for the submission of the pleadings. After extensions granted by the Tribunal, the time limit in question duly expired in April 2008. In these circumstances, the Tribunal shares to an extent the frustration expressed by Libananco that it remains in the dark as to what case it will have to meet, be it a straightforward defence on the merits, a preliminary objection as to jurisdiction or related matters, or a combination of the two. The Tribunal would have been in a better position to deal with the applications covered by the present Decision had it already been in possession of the formal lines of argument adopted by both Parties. The Tribunal, like any other arbitral tribunal in a similar position, could not allow its process to be used as the cover for a mere fishing expedition launched in the hope of uncovering material to serve as the foundation for an argument (preliminary or substantive) not yet formally advanced before it.\n\n71.\n\nThat said, it appears to the Tribunal that, in the no doubt somewhat unusual circumstances with which it is confronted, there is sufficient reason to take advantage of the cooperative willingness of the Claimant and grant the measure requested. The Tribunal does so, however, expressly in the interests of moving the arbitral process forward efficiently and also expeditiously. \u00a7 3.2 of the Order is therefore to be seen as closely linked to \u00a7\u00a7 2.1 and 2.2: the Respondent is to file its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction and merits by 1 July 2008, and will have a strictly limited period thereafter to amend this pleading in the light of the results of its inspection of the documents.\n\n**VII. 3 \u2018Summary\u2019 judgment**\n-----------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal uses the term \u2018summary judgment\u2019 as shorthand for the exceptional remedies which Libananco asked the Tribunal to grant it in these circumstances. This is far and away the most difficult, and most challenging, of the applications which the Tribunal has to determine. The background circumstances are essentially as follows. From the very outset of the proceedings the Tribunal has been faced by a repeated series of heated exchanges between the Parties, impugning on the one hand the standing and bona fides of the persons allegedly standing behind the Claimant and, on the other, the motives and methods of the Turkish authorities in pursuing their many differences with such persons. By the time of its First Request for Production of Documents, on 1 August 2007, this war of words had matured into a specific allegation brought to the Tribunal by Libananco that the Turkish authorities were holding Libananco\u2019s legal representatives and potential witnesses under surveillance and Claimant\u2019s counsel had informed the Tribunal that the surveillance had led to the Claimant\u2019s Turkish legal expert (who had worked with Claimant\u2019s counsel for many months) refusing to testify owing to fear of Government reprisal and harassment. In a written submission to the Tribunal in September 2007, Turkey responded with a formal denial of these allegations, while drawing attention to criminal investigations in train in Turkey into financial crime on a massive scale, in which investigations certain persons connected with the claims before the Tribunal were or might be implicated. The Respondent\u2019s formal denial was based in part on assurances from the relevant Government Ministries and in part on assurances received by the latter from the prosecuting authorities. On the basis of the assurances given by the Respondent, the Claimant withdrew its application since, if the Government denied the existence of any relevant documents, there was no point in pursuing the application. However, it reserved its right to bring the application back on, and understandably did so. On 29 February 2008, Libananco seized the Tribunal with a more precise and pointed set of allegations, backed up by documentary evidence in the form of Orders sealed by a Turkish Court, to the effect that there had been (notwithstanding the formal denial just mentioned) a sustained campaign of interception of the e-mail communications of Libananco\u2019s counsel in this arbitration. As a result, it was alleged, the Respondent had had access to literally hundreds, or even thousands, of counsel\u2019s communications with their clients, contacts and potential witnesses in Turkey; this would have included access to documentary attachments covering the preparation and development of Libananco\u2019s case as Claimant, with irrevocable prejudice to its position in this arbitration. Libananco\u2019s counsel told the Tribunal that up to 2,000 of the communications that might have been intercepted were privileged and/or confidential.\n\n73.\n\nWhile Libananco\u2019s relief claimed started out as a request to exclude the Respondent from the rest of the proceedings, by the time of the hearing this position had been refined substantially. In the end, the Claimant was seeking to exclude the Respondent from the \"current phase of the arbitral process\". It did not request a summary decision in the true sense. Rather, it accepted that the Tribunal would have to make a decision in terms of both jurisdiction and the merits, and maintained that it should do so on the basis of the evidence before it without receiving any further evidence from either party.\n\n74.\n\nThese are allegations which, supported as they were (as indicated above) by prima facie documentary evidence, the Tribunal was bound to treat with the utmost seriousness. It called upon Turkey to state without delay whether it acknowledged the authenticity of the Court orders produced by Libananco and, if so, on what basis Claimant's counsel had been included in the request put to the Court by the Public Prosecutor to grant the interception orders. It should be said at once that Respondent\u2019s counsel, to their credit, had immediately recognized the seriousness of the matter (which no doubt they saw as potentially touching their own professional ethics and responsibilities) and had already informed the Tribunal of their own motion that they were asking their client to have the matter looked into urgently.\n\n75.\n\nRespondent\u2019s answer, received by the Tribunal in writing and reiterated in oral argument at the hearing, was essentially in four parts: (a) that there had never been any intention to conduct surveillance, covert or overt, of Claimant\u2019s preparations for this arbitration, nor had that in fact been done; (b) that Turkey, as a sovereign State, had an undeniable entitlement to conduct investigation into crime, particularly serious crime, within its jurisdiction, which could neither be affected, nor brought to a halt, by the existence in parallel of an ICSID arbitration; (c) that the earlier assurances by the Public Prosecutor were given in good faith, and reflected the situation at the time they were given; and (d) that the e-mail addresses to be intercepted represented a comprehensive list of those thought to have been used for communication with a particular suspect, but that the appearance *pro tempore* of counsels\u2019 addresses on that list did not imply that actual communications to or from those addresses would be read, still less passed to those responsible for the conduct of Turkey\u2019s case in this arbitration. In reinforcement of that last point, counsel for Turkey gave what the Tribunal took to be formal personal assurances that they had neither been offered nor seen any such material. These assurances were qualified at the hearing when counsel disclosed that, in a meeting with the Public Prosecutor, a number of English language documents were reviewed to assist the Prosecutor in determining which documents were privileged and should be destroyed. A number of these, including a draft of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial in this case, bore headings that indicated they were privileged. Counsel did not read the documents in question and advised the Prosecutor that they were privileged and should be destroyed.\n\n76.\n\nIn sum, Turkey denies that, given these explanations, any actual prejudice could have been caused to Libananco in the arbitration. In response to this, Libananco makes the obvious retort that, once interception is admitted, the way in which intercepted material was handled becomes a matter of pure conjecture, and that none of Respondent\u2019s assurances touches the possibility that privileged material might have been seen by Turkish officials and might then have played an unspoken part in the instructions given by them to the in-house or outside lawyers conducting Turkey\u2019s case. The Tribunal might add that some of the documents attached to the reports from the Public Prosecutor and included in Respondent\u2019s submissions to the Tribunal clearly and without any doubt were capable of causing prejudice of the kind Libananco alleges, and that some other such documents were included in a redacted form (presumably designed to counter any supposition of prejudice) though it remained unclear even at the end of the hearing by whom or on what basis the redaction had been undertaken.\n\n77.\n\nLibananco\u2019s counsel then add the further point that the references in Respondent\u2019s written and oral submissions to unauthorized receipt and onward transmission of the interception orders of the Turkish Court being in itself a serious criminal offence which was under investigation, coupled with repeated polemical references over an extended period to Claimant\u2019s counsel in person, look very much like a standing threat to intimidate them from representing their client freely. Respondent\u2019s counsel had no real answer to this, other than that some of the Respondent\u2019s submissions might have been incautiously phrased.\n\n78.\n\nThese allegations and counter-allegations strike at principles which lie at the very heart of the ICSID arbitral process, and the Tribunal is bound to approach them accordingly. Among the principles affected are: basic procedural fairness, respect for confidentiality and legal privilege (and indeed for the immunities accorded to parties, their counsel, and witnesses under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention); the right of parties both to seek advice and to advance their respective cases freely and without interference; and no doubt others as well. For its own part, the Tribunal would add to the list respect for the Tribunal itself, as the organ freely chosen by the Parties for the binding settlement of their dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention. It requires no further recital by the Tribunal to establish either that these are indeed fundamental principles, or why they are. Nor does the Tribunal doubt for a moment that, like any other international tribunal, it must be regarded as endowed with the inherent powers required to preserve the integrity of its own process - even if the remedies open to it are necessarily different from those that might be available to a domestic court of law in an ICSID Member State. The Tribunal would express the principle as being that parties have an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith and that an arbitral tribunal has the inherent jurisdiction to ensure that this obligation is complied with; this principle applies in all arbitration, including investment arbitration, and to all parties, including States (even in the exercise of their sovereign powers).\n\n79.\n\nIn approaching the matter in the light of the above, the Tribunal does not question the assurances given on behalf of Turkey, and recorded in paragraph 75 above. Extra weight was given to them by the fact that they were delivered by highly reputable counsel of international standing, conscious of their own professional responsibilities. The Tribunal takes it as a given, for example, that a sovereign State does indeed have a right and duty to pursue the commission of serious crime, and that that right and duty cannot be affected by the existence of an ICSID arbitration against it, or put into commission by the fact that an ICSID arbitration is begun against it. That proposition is expressly reflected in the Orders below. The question is, however, whether that basic proposition, on its own, is enough. The Tribunal recalls the well-known saying, very frequently repeated in legal discussion, that it is not enough that justice should be done, it must also manifestly be seen to be done. From that it must follow that, even if Turkey can be excused for not previously having taken steps to ensure the strict separation of its criminal investigations, on the one hand, from the prosecution of this arbitration, on the other, that will not be sufficient for the future. The right and duty to investigate crime, accepted by the Tribunal above, cannot mean that the investigative power may be exercised without regard to other rights and duties, or that, by starting a criminal investigation, a State may baulk an ICSID arbitration. To its credit, counsel for the Respondent did not challenge the essential principle that privilege must be respected even in the midst of a criminal investigation, as shown by counsel for the Respondent\u2019s account of her meeting with the Public Prosecutor of Sisli [see Transcript of Hearing on Various Applications dated Monday, April 28, 2008 at page 170 to 174], When the Respondent asks the Tribunal in its written submissions to accept that \"[t]he prosecutors\u2019 understanding, interest and patience for this offshore international arbitration, which falls within the remit of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and concerns the termination of administrative energy concession contracts for fault several years ago, are understandably limited\", the Tribunal must decline to do so. The coin has two sides, and both must be respected and put in harmony with one another. That is accordingly the purpose of the rule of separation laid down in \u00a71.2 of the Orders below. But that rule must be seen together with the specific provisions in \u00a7\u00a71.1.1-1.1.5, which serve the purpose not merely of itemising the reassurances that counsel for an ICSID claimant is entitled to rely on, but of stimulating the Respondent in this arbitration to set up specific machinery to ensure that the rule of separation is made good in practice. With that, justice will also be seen to be done.\n\n80.\n\nThe question arose, and was hotly debated between the Parties at the hearing, whether Libananco had in fact suffered prejudice in this arbitration by the interceptions undertaken under the Court orders. This was in turn linked to the argument as to whether the Claimant could hypothetically be entitled to the extreme form of relief which it was asking the Tribunal to grant (a summary judgment of one kind or another). The Tribunal notes that the question of possible prejudice is largely a matter of allegation and counter-allegation; it has not been proved or disproved, and indeed may not even be capable of proof, given the secret and clandestine nature of the interference alleged (though see paragraph 76 *in fine* above). The Tribunal does not believe that these are matters that have to be decided now: irrespective of whether the Tribunal is or is not endowed with powers as far-reaching as Libananco wishes it to assert, Libananco\u2019s entitlement to future protection for its agents, counsel and witnesses is clearly not conditional on proof that it has actually been prejudiced in the conduct of its case. As to the future, the Tribunal prefers to leave the matter open, relying expressly on both Parties to do their utmost to give effect, in good faith, to the present Orders. \u00a7\u00a71.1.6 & 1.1.7 foreshadow as of now the exclusion from the future proceedings in this Arbitration of any privileged documents or information or evidence derived therefrom. The operation of that exclusion will naturally depend on proof of privilege in whatever manner seems to be appropriate in accordance with the particular circumstances, once it is claimed that protected material has in fact been submitted. If, as the arbitration progresses, it turns out that the Respondent has used, in any way, privileged or confidential information obtained during the surveillance, the Claimant will be at liberty to bring an appropriate application to the Tribunal. The Tribunal attributes great importance to privilege and confidentiality, and if instructions have been given with the benefit of improperly obtained privileged or confidential information, severe prejudice may result. If that event arises, the Tribunal may consider other remedies available apart from the exclusion of improperly obtained evidence or information.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal has given serious consideration to the Claimant\u2019s refined request for relief described at paragraph 73. However, in the present circumstances, the Tribunal does not believe it is warranted. With the Orders below, read in the light of the reasons above, the Tribunal believes that such orders are an adequate response to the Claimant\u2019s request and expects the proceedings in this arbitration now to be back on track, and relies upon both Parties and their legal representatives to carry them forward expeditiously and in good order.\n\n82.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal made the following orders in its letter to the Parties on 1 May 2008.\n\n**\"1. ORDERS ON CLAIMANT\u2019S APPLICATION OF FEBRUARY 29, 2008**\n\n1.1.1) Subject to paragraph 1.2 below, the Respondent must not intercept or record communications between legal counsel for the Claimant on the one hand and representatives of the Claimant and other persons in Turkey on the other hand.\n\n1.1.2) The Respondent must permit legal counsel for the Claimant to have access, free from surveillance, to any person within Turkey for the purposes of preparing or conducting Claimant's case in this arbitration.\n\n1.1.3) The Respondent must within 30 days of this order obtain a statement from the Public Prosecutor of Sisli that (subject to paragraph 1.2 below) all emails (including attachments) and communications intercepted by or under the direction of the Public Prosecutor which in any way relate to this arbitration have been or will within a period of 30 days be destroyed.\n\n1.1.4) The Respondent must take steps to ensure that its criminal investigators and others having access to or knowledge of intercepted emails and other communications falling within paragraph 1.1.1 above do not provide copies or communicate the contents of (or information deriving from) such documents to any persons having any role in the defence of this arbitration.\n\n1.1.5) To facilitate the application of Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant may provide the Respondent (and copied to the Tribunal) with a list of persons to whom the Claimant considers that Article 22 (read with Article 21) applies in this arbitration.\n\n1.1.6) All privileged documents and information which have been tendered or disclosed to the Tribunal in connection with the Claimant\u2019s application of February, 29, 2008 will be excluded from the evidence to be received in this arbitration.\n\n1.1.7) Any privileged documents or information which may be introduced into evidence in future proceedings of this arbitration will be excluded as well as any evidence derived from possession of privileged documents or information.\n\n1.2 The Tribunal recognizes that the Respondent may in the legitimate exercise of its sovereign powers conduct investigations into suspected criminal activities in Turkey. The Respondent must, however, ensure that no information or documents coming to the knowledge or into the possession of its criminal investigation authorities shall be made available to any person having any role in the defence of this arbitration.\n\n**2. ORDERS AS TO THE COUNTER-MEMORIAL**\n\n2.1. The Respondent must file and serve its Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits by July 1, 2008.\n\n2.2. The Tribunal grants the Respondent liberty to amend or supplement its Counter Memorial within 4 weeks after completion of its inspection of the Share Certificates provided for in paragraph 3.2. below.\n\n**3. ORDERS AS TO DOCUMENT PRODUCTION**\n\n3.1. The Claimant must produce copies of the documents requested under Prayers 2, 5, 7(a), 10, 12, 15 and 19 of Respondent\u2019s First Request to Produce dated December 18, 2007 (\"the First Request\") by June 2, 2008.\n\n3.2. As to Prayer 1 of the First Request, the Tribunal orders as follows.\n\n3.2.1.) By July 1, 2008, the Claimant must deliver to an Escrow Agent (\"the Escrow Agent\") the originals of the documents requested under Prayer 1 of the First Request (\"the Share Certificates\").\n\n3.2.2.) The Escrow Agent will be appointed by the Claimant subject to the approval of the Tribunal after the Tribunal has heard the views of the Respondent, but must hold the Share Certificates to the order of the Tribunal and must take instructions only from the Tribunal. The place of custody will be determined by the Escrow Agent, subject to the approval of the Tribunal, after the Tribunal has heard the views of the parties.\n\n3.2.3.) The Claimant will in the first instance pay the costs of delivery of the Share Certificates to the Escrow Agent, without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s eventual decision on the apportionment of the costs of the proceeding.\n\n3.2.4.) The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent must in the first instance be paid by the Claimant but the Respondent must reimburse half of such fees and expenses to the Claimant promptly on demand.\n\n3.2.5.) After the Escrow Agent has taken custody of the Share Certificates, the Respondent will be at liberty to employ forensic experts (at its expense) to examine the Share Certificates, but such examination must not destroy or damage the Share Certificates in any way.

Such examination must be completed within 3 months after the appointment of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent must not without the written consent of the Tribunal permit the Share Certificates (or any of them) to leave the place of custody designated by the Escrow Agent and approved by the Tribunal.\n\n3.2.6.) While the Share Certificates are in the custody of the Escrow Agent, or in transit to and from such custody, neither party may seize or attach the Share Certificates (or any of them) or attempt to do so by any means whatsoever including but not limited to any governmental, administrative, legal or extra-legal measure, or otherwise interfere with the custodial arrangements set out in this Order.\n\n3.2.7.)

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a claim brought by the Claimant, Libananco Holdings Co. Limited (\"Claimant\" or \"Libananco\"), a Cypriot company, against the Republic of Turkey (\"Respondent\" or \"Turkey\"), in respect of a number of alleged breaches of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\"), to which both the Republic of Cyprus (\"Cyprus\") and Turkey are Contracting Parties. The dispute concerns the seizure of two Turkish utility companies, Cukurova Elektrik Anonim Sirketi (\"\u00c7EA\u015e\") and Kepez Elektrik Turk Anonim Sirketi (\"Kepez\"), in respect of which Libananco holds shares and the cancellation of concession agreements between the latter two entities and the Respondent on 12 June 2003. The Claimant invoked the dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 26 of the ECT and submitted the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThis Award deals with certain preliminary objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent. The jurisdictional phase has involved extensive submissions by the Parties accompanied by a significant number of exhibits and legal authorities. While the Tribunal does not discuss all exhibits and legal authorities, it has carefully considered all the evidence and legal authorities in this case.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant in this arbitration is Libananco Holdings Co. Limited, a limited liability company domiciled and organised under the laws of Cyprus.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by its duly authorised attorneys, Crowell & Moring LLP and Mr Achilleas L Demetriades.\n\n5.\n\nThe names of the Claimant\u2019s attorneys and their office addresses are listed on the inside cover of the present Award.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent in this arbitration is Turkey.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by its duly authorised attorneys, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and Co\u00a7ar Avukathk Burosu.\n\n8.\n\nThe names of the Respondent\u2019s attorneys and their office addresses are listed on the inside cover of the present Award.\n\n**III. THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**\n------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 February 2006, ICSID received a Request for the institution of arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention filed by the Claimant against the Respondent (\"Request for Arbitration\"). The Request for Arbitration was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 19 March 2006, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n10.\n\nThe notice of registration invited the Parties to communicate to ICSID any provisions agreed by them regarding the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. By letter of 30 May 2006, the Parties informed ICSID that they had reached agreement on the method, according to which the Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party within a certain time limit and the presiding arbitrator (the President of the Tribunal) to be appointed by agreement of the Parties by 17 August 2006, failing which the appointment would be made by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID.\n\n11.\n\nWithin the agreed time limits, the Claimant appointed Mr Henri Alvarez (later Mr Henri Alvarez Q.C.), a national of Canada, and the Respondent appointed Sir Franklin Berman Q.C., a national of the United Kingdom. The Parties having failed to reach agreement on the presiding arbitrator, the Claimant, by letter dated 21 August 2006, requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appoint the presiding arbitrator. On 11 December 2006, after consulting the Parties, the Chairman appointed Mr Michael Hwang S.C., a national of the Republic of Singapore, as the presiding arbitrator and hence the President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was thus constituted and the proceedings began on 18 December 2006, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"). Mr Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was designated as the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary. He was later replaced by Ms Martina Polasek, Senior Counsel, ICSID.\n\n12.\n\nPursuant to Rule 13(1) of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties in New York on 12 February 2007 at the offices of the Respondent\u2019s Counsel. Among other things, it was agreed that the Arbitration Rules in effect as of 1 January 2003 would govern the proceedings; that the place of proceedings would be Washington, D.C.; and that the procedural language would be English. As the Parties did not agree on the procedural calendar, the Tribunal decided that the Claimant would file a Memorial on jurisdiction and merits, but not on quantum, by 13 August 2007, and that the Respondent would file a Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction and the merits within six months of receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial. Upon receipt of both submissions, the Tribunal would decide whether to bifurcate jurisdiction from the merits.\n\n13.\n\nOn 1 August 2007, the Claimant filed a request for extension of time to file its Memorial. By agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal granted the request and allowed the Respondent the same amount of additional time to file its Counter-Memorial.\n\n14.\n\nConcurrently with its request for extension, the Claimant\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents, concerning an alleged surveillance by the Respondent of the Claimant\u2019s potential witnesses and counsel, was filed. On 17 September 2007, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent filed a response to the Claimant\u2019s latter request, advising that enquiries had been made with the relevant government departments and that they had affirmed that no surveillance of the Claimant\u2019s Counsel had been or was being carried out; consequently there were no documents to produce.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant filed a reply on 19 November 2007, questioning the Respondent\u2019s affirmation that no surveillance was being carried out and reserving its right to reinstate its First Request for Production of Documents. By letter of 3 December 2007, the Tribunal acknowledged that the Claimant had withdrawn its request for the production of documents.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits on 12 October 2007 (\"C.M\"). The C.M was accompanied by exhibits and legal authorities, as well as four Witness Statements of Mr Cem Cengiz Uzan, Mr Reha Ferhun Gulu, Ms Emel Ersen Gunaydin and Ms Hulya Ozveren, and three expert reports of Dr Michael B Rosenzweig, Prof Dr Christian Rumpf and Prof Dr Rudolf Dolzer.\n\n17.\n\nOn 18 December 2007, the Respondent\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents, relating to the Claimant\u2019s business activities and its acquisition and ownership of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares, was filed. Concurrently, the Respondent applied for provisional measures concerning security for costs (\"Application for Security for Costs\"), requesting an order that the Claimant post security adequate to guarantee payment of any award of legal fees and other costs in the Respondent\u2019s favour, namely the amount of US$5 million, or such other amount as the Tribunal might deem appropriate.\n\n18.\n\nAfter comments by the Parties on the Respondent\u2019s two requests, filed respectively on 11 February 2008 (the Claimant\u2019s objections to the requests) and 25 February 2008 (the Respondent\u2019s further arguments in support of its Application for Security for Costs), the Claimant submitted an application requesting for summary relief (\"Claimant\u2019s Application for Summary Relief\u2019) on 29 February 2008. The application was based on information indicating that the Respondent had conducted intercepts of emails and MSN messages sent by and to the Claimant, persons associated with the Claimant and the Claimant\u2019s Counsel in this case.\n\n19.\n\nBy its submission of 19 March 2008, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal deny the Claimant\u2019s Application for Summary Relief. In addition, it applied for an order that the Claimant deposit the original share certificates in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez for safekeeping, as a safeguard against an illegitimate course of action that the Respondent alleged could be undertaken by the Claimant. On 25 March 2008, the Claimant filed its comments on the Respondent\u2019s observations of 19 March 2008, including new evidence concerning the alleged surveillance, and objected to the request for physical deposit of the relevant share certificates. The Respondent filed a rejoinder on 7 April 2008.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal suspended the time limit for the filing of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial and fixed a hearing on the Parties\u2019 respective applications. It also requested and received, on 11 April 2008, the Parties\u2019 summaries of their respective positions concerning the various requests.\n\n21.\n\nThe hearing on the Parties\u2019 applications was held on 28 April and 29 April 2008 at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. The Tribunal deliberated immediately following the hearing and, on 1 May 2008, issued orders on each of the applications, pending the issuance of a more detailed decision containing the reasoning. That decision was issued on 23 June 2008 (the \"Decision on Preliminary Issues\").\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the Claimant\u2019s Application for Summary Relief and addressed the Claimant\u2019s concerns concerning intercepts and surveillance through certain protective orders made pursuant to Article 22 of the ICSID Convention, while recognising the Respondent\u2019s sovereign powers to conduct criminal investigations. With respect to the Respondent\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents, the Tribunal ordered, among other things, that the Claimant deliver originals of share certificates in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to an escrow agent, who would hold the certificates to the order of the Tribunal and would take instructions only from the Tribunal. During the escrow agent\u2019s custody of the share certificates, the certificates would be subject to forensic examination by the Parties\u2019 respective experts. The Tribunal declined to recommend any measures in respect of the Respondent\u2019s Application for Security for Costs. Finally, the Tribunal instructed the Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits and jurisdiction by 1 July 2008.\n\n23.\n\nOn 23 June 2008, the Respondent filed Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (\"Preliminary Objections\" or \"R.PO\"). The Respondent referred to Rule 41(1) and 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules and requested for the Tribunal to suspend the proceedings on the merits to deal with the Preliminary Objections as a preliminary question.\n\n24.\n\nOn 1 July 2008, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s orders, deposited all the bearer share certificates in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez that it owned and that were in its physical possession to a proposed escrow agent in Vienna, Austria. The Claimant subsequently submitted the details of the proposed escrow agent to the Tribunal. The Parties consulted with a view to reaching an agreement on the issues relating to the deposit of the share certificates and other original documents, their inspection, the proposed agent and bifurcation of jurisdiction from the merits. As they were unable to reach agreement, by letters of 17 July and 23 July 2008 respectively, the Parties sought orders from the Tribunal. The Claimant opposed a bifurcation of jurisdiction from the merits on liability and requested the Tribunal to direct the Respondent to submit its Counter-Memorial on the merits forthwith.\n\n25.\n\nIn its Procedural Order of 11 August 2008, the Tribunal recalled its previous orders and directions. It stated that its decisions recorded in the Minutes of the first session remained in effect, and that the Respondent must accordingly file its arguments on the merits, after which the Tribunal would consider the question of bifurcation. The Tribunal granted the Respondent until 21 September 2008 to complete its Counter-Memorial on the merits.\n\n26.\n\nAlso in its Order of 11 August 2008, the Tribunal recalled its order on document production of 1 May 2008 and directed the Claimant to comply with that order. It set out a procedure and fixed time limits in respect of the appointment of an escrow agent, the determination of the place of custody of the share certificates and the Parties\u2019 agreement on the terms of a protocol of inspection. The Tribunal also repeated its protective orders concerning persons on the Claimant\u2019s team of agents and representatives made pursuant to Article 22 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n27.\n\nOn 19 August 2008, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it nominated Mr Stephan Meusburger of the law firm of Benesch & Meusburger in Vienna, Austria, as the escrow agent, and requested for the Tribunal\u2019s approval of that appointment. The Respondent did not object to the appointment, but reserved its position as to certain arrangements concerning the proposed place of custody, a facility called \"Das Safe\" in Vienna, Austria.\n\n28.\n\nBy order of 16 September 2008, the Tribunal approved Mr Meusburger as the escrow agent and directed him to provide further details concerning the place of custody for the Parties\u2019 consideration. Consequently, the escrow agent and the Claimant concluded an Escrow Agent Agreement. Following several letters from the escrow agent and the Respondent concerning Das Safe, the Respondent agreed to that facility as the place of custody.\n\n29.\n\nOn 26 September 2008, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (\"R.CM\"). The R.CM was accompanied by two witness statements of Mr Mustafa Cetin and Mr Adem Ektirir, a legal opinion of Prof Dr Zehreddin Aslan and an expert report of Messrs Manuel A Abdala and Pablo T Spiller of LECG. It also contained four volumes of exhibits and four volumes of legal authorities.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 9 October 2008, referring to the Tribunal\u2019s Order of 11 August 2008, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order bifurcation of jurisdiction from the merits. It also renewed its request for production of documents under its First Request for the Production of Documents, namely in respect of certain original documents other than the share certificates. By letter of 14 October 2008, the Claimant objected to the request for bifurcation of the proceedings, but agreed to the production of the requested documents. On 20 October 2008, the Respondent agreed to the inspection of the new documents at Das Safe. However, it maintained its request for bifurcation and proposed a briefing schedule on jurisdiction. The Claimant submitted further observations on bifurcation on 21 October 2008 and the Respondent did likewise on 24 October 2008.\n\n31.\n\nOn 3 November 2008, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order approving Das Safe as the place of custody and directing that the inspection of the share certificates be completed within three months of the latter Procedural Order. It further directed the Claimant to produce a copy of the rental agreement for Das Safe and to produce, within three weeks, the documents requested in the Respondent\u2019s letter of 9 October 2008, for an inspection of those documents to take place in Washington, D.C.\n\n32.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order, the Claimant provided the Tribunal and the Respondent with a copy of the rental agreement for Das Safe. The Parties then consulted with a view to reaching an agreement on an inspection protocol. On 10 November and 11 November 2008, they submitted, for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration, their respective draft protocols concerning the inspection at Das Safe, with points of disagreement highlighted. On 19 November 2008, the Parties submitted an agreed protocol concerning the documents to be inspected in Washington, D.C. at the offices of Crowell & Moring LLP over the period 24 November to 19 December 2008. Having considered the Parties\u2019 proposals concerning Das Safe, on 21 November 2008, the Tribunal issued a final inspection protocol for immediate use.\n\n33.\n\nOn 17 December 2008, the Tribunal issued an Order concerning the bifurcation of jurisdiction from the merits. It selected certain issues to be heard as preliminary questions pursuant to Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules (\"Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections\"). The Order stated in relevant part that:\n\n\"2 *The issues which have been selected by the Tribunal for preliminary hearing... from the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections (R.PO) are:*\n\n*a. Issue V.B (Libananco is not an Investor within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the ECT);*\n\n*b. Issue VE (Libananco\u2019s Claims do not satisfy express conditions on Turkey\u2019s Consent to Arbitration);*\n\n*c. Issue VIA (Libananco is not entitled to the benefits under Art. 17 of the ECT).*\n\n*3. These issues have been selected on the basis that they are:*\n\n*a. genuinely preliminary;*\n\n*b. discrete; and*\n\n*c. capable of bringing the proceedings to an end;*\n\n*and can be properly disposed of in summary proceedings without causing undue delay to the substantive disposal of the case if none of the objections was upheld\".*\n\n34.\n\nAlso in its Order of 17 December 2008, the Tribunal instructed the Respondent to finalise an amended or supplemented Counter-Memorial after the inspection of documents, by 3 March 2009, and fixed time limits for the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections. Following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal reserved dates for a hearing on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections (\"Preliminary Objections Hearing\"), to be held in Washington, D.C. over the period 2 November to 4 November 2009.\n\n35.\n\nOn 20 February 2009, the escrow agent reported that the Respondent had completed its inspection at Das Safe. Following an invitation from the Tribunal, the Parties commented on whether or not documents should be released from the place of custody. The Respondent\u2019s position was that the bearer share certificates should remain at Das Safe, subject to the control and direction of the Tribunal for the remainder of the proceeding. The Claimant did not oppose the Respondent\u2019s request that the bearer share certificates continue to be held at the place of custody. The Tribunal therefore directed the escrow agent to continue to hold the share certificates to the order of the Tribunal and take instructions only from the Tribunal until further notice.\n\n36.\n\nOn 25 February 2009, the Claimant submitted its Second Request for the Production of Documents, which concerned categories of documents relating to the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, including certain seized shares. The Parties filed several rounds of comments on the Claimant\u2019s Second Request for the Production of Documents in a Redfern Schedule (the Respondent on 9 March and 21 April 2009, and the Claimant on 20 March and 16 April and 29 April 2009).\n\n37.\n\nOn 3 March 2009, the Respondent submitted a Supplement to its Counter-Memorial (\"R.Supp\"), including a forensic expert report of Riley, Welch, LaPorte & Associates (\"RWL\") and an expert report of the Istanbul Stock Exchange Settlement & Custody Bank. The Supplement was also accompanied by seven volumes of supporting materials and an external hard drive containing photomicrographs.\n\n38.\n\nIn addition, on 3 March 2009, the Respondent filed a Request for Modification of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order of 17 December 2008 (\"Request for Modification\"), accompanied by a legal opinion of Sir Elihu Lauterpacht. The Respondent alleged that it had, as a result of the inspection process in Washington, D.C. and Vienna, discovered evidence that the Claimant had relied on fraudulently manufactured documents to support its jurisdictional case. Accordingly, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal add to the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections the further objection that Libananco had failed to prove timely ownership of an investment.\n\n39.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Modification proposing that, by 3 July 2009, the Claimant file a response to the \"timing\" allegations of the Respondent, including the submissions made in the Supplement. The Respondent filed further comments by letter of 13 March 2009. On 17 March 2009, the Tribunal directed the Claimant to provide further justification as to the time it sought for the preparation of a response, which it did by letter of 20 March 2009. The Respondent was granted the opportunity to reply (by 27 March 2009) and the Claimant to file a rej oinder (by 3 April 2009).\n\n40.\n\nOn 27 March 2009, the Claimant filed its Third Request for the Production of Documents, supported by affidavits of three forensic experts: Messrs Peter Tytell, Lloyd Cunningham and Valery Aginsky. The Parties filed comments on the Claimant\u2019s Third Request in a Redfern Schedule (the Respondent on 3 April and 16 April 2009, and the Claimant on 10 April 2009).\n\n41.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, the Tribunal directed the Claimant to file a response to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Modification and to the Respondent\u2019s Supplement by 3 June 2009. The Tribunal further directed the Respondent to file a response by 3 August 2009 and the Claimant to file a rejoinder by 5 October 2009.\n\n42.\n\nOn 27 April 2009, the Tribunal ruled on the Claimant\u2019s Third Request for the Production of Documents, directing the Parties\u2019 forensic experts to meet with a view to producing a list of supporting materials used by each party\u2019s experts.\n\n43.\n\nOn 3 May 2009, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections (\"C.CM\"), including six witness statements of Mr Cem Cengiz Uzan, Mr Ali Cenk T\u00fcrkkan, Mr Saylan \u00c7i\u011fgin. Mr Antonis Partellas, Mr Polakis K Sarris and Ms Ayseg\u00fcl Akay Uzan, an expert report of Mr Christos Mavrellis, one volume of fact exhibits and a hard drive containing images of the approximately 49,000 bearer shares held in Das Safe.\n\n44.\n\nOn 12 May 2009, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order concerning the Claimant\u2019s Second Request for the Production of Documents, granting some requests and denying others.\n\n45.\n\nBy letter of 12 May 2009, as a result of a meeting between the forensic experts, the Claimant filed a request for the production of certain supporting materials used by the Respondent\u2019s experts, to which the Respondent replied on 14 May 2009. On 18 May 2009, the Tribunal issued directions concerning the type of materials that should be exchanged between the Parties\u2019 forensic experts.\n\n46.\n\nBy letter of 21 May 2009, the Respondent requested a four-week extension until 1 July 2009 to file its Reply on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections. After giving the Claimant an opportunity to comment, the Tribunal, by its Order of 26 May 2009, granted the extension until 19 June 2009.\n\n47.\n\nOn 3 June 2009, Claimant filed its Response to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Modification and Supplement (\"C.Res. Supp\"). The C.Res.Supp was accompanied by five expert reports of (i) Stroz Friedberg; (ii) Mr Peter Tytell; (iii) Dr Valery Aginsky; (iv) Mr Lloyd Cunningham; and (v) Messrs Brian Lindblom and Marc Gaudreau, a declaration of Mr Howard Rile, and one binder of exhibits.\n\n48.\n\nOn 19 June 2009, the Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on the Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, which was accompanied by eight volumes of exhibits and two volumes of legal authorities.\n\n49.\n\nOn 8 July 2009, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Modification. It amended its Order of 17 December 2008 to include the following issue to be argued at the Preliminary Objections Hearing:\n\n*\"15.4 Issue IV of the R.PO (Libananco has failed to prove that it owned CLAf and Kepez shares on or before June 2003)*\n\n50.\n\nThe Order of 8 July 2009 also dealt with certain case management issues, including directions concerning the procedural timetable and the Preliminary Objections Hearing. Among other things, the Tribunal directed the Parties that it intended to implement witness conferencing and hear the Parties\u2019 forensic and computer experts in appropriate \"conferencing groups\" according to their respective discipline, and that each \"conferencing group\" prepare a joint report for the Tribunal by 16 October 2009.\n\n51.\n\nOn 10 July 2009, the Respondent submitted its Second Request for the Production of Documents, concerning the Claimant\u2019s latest submissions of 3 May and 3 June 2009. The Parties filed several rounds of comments on the Respondent\u2019s Second Request for the Production of Documents in a Redfern Schedule (the Claimant on 15 July, 23 July, 31 August and 25 September 2009, and the Respondent on 27 July, 6 August and 1 October 2009).\n\n52.\n\nOn 13 July 2009, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order addressing a request from the Respondent that the Tribunal write to a criminal court in Turkey to gain access to a recording which had previously been produced in the form of a transcript (Exhibit R-113), the authenticity of which was disputed by the Claimant. The Tribunal stated that it was prepared to write to the Turkish court upon the Claimant\u2019s confirmation that it wished to have access to the recording. Having subsequently received that confirmation and the Parties\u2019 comments on a draft letter, the Tribunal wrote to the Turkish court accordingly on 29 July 2009.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter of 17 July 2009, the Claimant requested a two-week extension until 4 August 2009 to file its Rejoinder on the Preliminary Objections. The Respondent did not oppose the extension and also requested an extension until 14 August 2009 to file its Reply to the Claimant\u2019s Response. The Tribunal approved the new time limits.\n\n54.\n\nOn 3 August 2009, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections (\"C.Rej\"), accompanied by two Witness Statements of Messrs Craig Bamberger and Faruk Ulusoy, as well as one binder of fact exhibits, one binder of annexes and electronic copies of legal authorities.\n\n55.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant filed a Request for Modification of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Orders of 6 April 2007 and 17 December 2008 (\"Claimant\u2019s Request for Modification\"). It requested that the issue of quantum, which had previously been bifurcated by the Tribunal in 2007, be added to the remaining Preliminary Objections and the merits to be briefed in the event the Tribunal dismissed the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections. The Tribunal subsequently invited the Parties to make submissions on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Modification after the Preliminary Objections Hearing in November 2009.\n\n56.\n\nAlso on 3 August 2009, the Claimant submitted a Request to Examine Witnesses Under the Control of Respondent (\"Request to Examine Witnesses\"), seeking to cross-examine certain present and former Turkish Government officials and employees whom the Respondent had not put forward as witnesses. The Respondent objected to the Request to Examine Witnesses by letter of 14 August 2009, and sought leave to file responsive evidence to the Witness Statement of Mr Faruk Ulusoy. The Tribunal granted the latter request on 19 August 2009.\n\n57.\n\nOn 14 August 2009, the Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on Issues Contained in its Supplement to the Counter-Memorial (\"R.Rep.Supp\"), accompanied by three expert reports of (i) Riley Welch LaPorte & Associates Forensic Laboratories; (ii) Curtis W. Rose & Associates and Mandiant Corporation; and (iii) Dr. Durand R. Begault; and a Witness Statement of Mr Serkan Gercel. The R.Rep.Supp was also accompanied by four volumes of exhibits.\n\n58.\n\nOn 25 August 2009, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 19 August 2009, the Respondent filed three Witness Statements of Mr Enis G\u00fccl\u00fc Sirin, Mr Orhan Seyfi Guner and Mr Deniz Bozkurt and nine exhibits, as a response to certain allegations made in the C.Rej. The Claimant responded that it wished to cross-examine the three new witnesses at the Preliminary Objections Hearing and, as a result, withdrew two of the proposed witnesses from its Request to Examine Witnesses.\n\n59.\n\nOn 31 August 2009, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order concerning the remainder of the persons in the Claimant\u2019s Request to Examine Witnesses, denying the request. The Tribunal noted that the Preliminary Objections Hearing would be devoted to the issues previously identified by the Tribunal and that the examination of the proposed witnesses was not relevant to these issues.\n\n60.\n\nOn 2 September 2009, representatives of the Parties listened to the audio recordings underlying Exhibit R-113 (a transcript of those recordings) at a court in Istanbul.\n\n61.\n\nOn 28 September 2009, the Respondent submitted new evidence (Exhibits R-851 to R-855) in support of its R.PM and to refute the testimony of one of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses, Mr Ali Cenk T\u00fcrkkan.\n\n62.\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the Claimant filed a Motion to Strike Evidence from the Record (\"Motion to Strike\"). The motion concerned certain CD recordings and transcripts made of the recordings, as well as allegations and statements concerning alleged fraud and criminality directed at the Claimant, its shareholders and advisors. The Motion to Strike was accompanied by an expert report of BekTek LLC. The Respondent filed a response on 16 October 2009.\n\n63.\n\nHaving been granted a short extension, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder to the R.Supp on 12 October 2009. The Claimant had previously, on 9 October 2009, filed the supporting documents for the Rejoinder to the R.Supp, consisting of four Witness Statements of Mr Ali Cenk T\u00fcrkkan, Mr Antonis Partellas, Mr Murat Hakan Uzan and Mr Bret A Padres; three expert reports of (i) Stroz Friedberg; (ii) Mr Eoghan Casey (cmdLabs); and (iii) combined report of Messrs Tytell, Aginsky, Cunningham, Rile, Lindblom and Gaudreau; and a volume of exhibits.\n\n64.\n\nOn 12 October 2009, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that its owner, Mr Cem Cengiz Uzan (\"Cem Uzan\"), had applied for, and received, political asylum from France, where he was currently residing. The Claimant stated that Cem Uzan was available to testily at the World Bank\u2019s premises in Paris or by video-conference from Paris. On the same date, the Respondent submitted a list of witnesses that it wished to cross-examine at the Preliminary Objections Hearing. However, it noted that a serious issue arose as to the legality and propriety of testimony by one of the witnesses that it had provisionally called, Mr Murat Hakan Uzan (\"Hakan Uzan\"), owing to an Interpol Red Notice and an arrest warrant issued by a US Federal Court in New York.\n\n65.\n\nIn a letter of 13 October 2009, the Respondent submitted its views on the issue of hearing four of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses; namely Hakan Uzan, Mr Ah Cenk T\u00fcrkkan, Cem Uzan and Ms Ayseg\u00fcl Akay Uzan (\"Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan\"). It stated that: (i) Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s situation was similar to that of Hakan Uzan in that he was also subject to an Interpol Red Notice; (ii) Cem Uzan had absconded from Turkey because of a conviction of embezzlement which was currently pending appeal in Turkey; and (iii) Ms Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan might also have absconded from Turkey in violation of judicial and administrative orders. The Respondent submitted that, in these circumstances, it would be wrong as a matter of law and judicial propriety to permit the four witnesses to testify, and requested that their statements be stricken or disregarded. It reserved its position on the question of cross-examination should the witnesses be allowed to testily.\n\n66.\n\nOn 14 October 2009, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference with the Parties by telephone conference. Among other things, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal allow Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Mr T\u00fcrkkan to testify by video-conference from the World Bank offices in Paris, Amman and a third undisclosed location. The Claimant also informed the Tribunal that Ms Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan would be unable to testify due to illness. The Claimant subsequently filed a medical certificate to that effect.\n\n67.\n\nOn 16 October 2009, the Claimant submitted its comments concerning the testimony of the four witnesses and observations on proposals concerning the order of witnesses and experts at the Preliminary Objections Hearing. On the same day, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant\u2019s Motion to Strike. The Claimant filed a reply on 20 October 2009.\n\n68.\n\nOn 21 October 2009, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had received from the Respondent a new expert report of RWL, which dealt with an entirely new set of documents. The Claimant requested for the Tribunal decide that the report was inadmissible if the Respondent sought to introduce it into the record. The Respondent replied on the same day, arguing, among other things, that the report was short and related to two discrete forensic issues. The Respondent further requested that the Tribunal order the production of a first generation photocopy of an exhibit previously produced by the Claimant for forensic testing, after which the Respondent would decide on its position whether or not to seek leave to introduce the report into the record. The Claimant submitted further comments on the latter report by letter of 23 October 2009.\n\n69.\n\nOn 22 October 2009, the Tribunal issued its decision on the Respondent\u2019s Amended Second Request for the Production of Documents. It also issued a Procedural Order on the Claimant\u2019s Motion to Strike and the Respondent\u2019s request to exclude witness testimony. The Tribunal declined to strike any evidence from the record for the time being, and stated that it would rule on the Claimant\u2019s Motion to Strike during the Preliminary Objections Hearing. The Tribunal further declined to strike the written statements of Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan, Ms Aysegul Uzan and Mr T\u00fcrkkan from the record, but stated that their testimony would not be heard during the November 2009 hearing because of concerns raised by ICSID concerning certain legal implications arising from the latter. By letter of 23 October 2009, ICSID clarified its concerns.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter of 26 October 2009, the Tribunal instructed the Respondent to file the supplementary report of RWL by 27 October 2009, without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on its admissibility. Pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Respondent filed the supplementary report, dated 20 October 2009 on 27 October 2009 (\"RWL Supplementary Report\").\n\n71.\n\nAlso on 26 October 2009, pursuant to the Parties\u2019 agreement during the pre-hearing conference, the Parties filed rebuttal exhibits.\n\n72.\n\nOn 28 October 2009, the Parties filed two joint reports of the audio forensics experts and the computer forensics experts. An additional joint report by the document forensics experts was filed on 31 October 2009.\n\n73.\n\nAlso on 28 October 2009, following the Claimant\u2019s notification that Mr Ulusoy would not testify at the hearing, the Respondent requested an urgent decision by the Tribunal to disqualify Mr Ulusoy\u2019s Witness Statement and excuse the Respondent\u2019s three rebuttal witnesses from appearing for cross-examination. By its Order of 30 October 2009, the Tribunal declined to strike Mr Ulusoy\u2019s Witness Statement for the time being, and stated that it wished to hear the oral testimony of the Respondent\u2019s three rebuttal witnesses, Messrs Sirin, G\u00fcner and Bozkurt.\n\n74.\n\nThe Preliminary Objections Hearing was held in Washington, D.C. over the period 4 November to 7 November 2009. In addition to Freshfileds Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and Cosar Avukathk B\u00fcrosu, the Respondent was represented by Mr Mark Howard, Q.C. The Claimant was represented by Crowell & Moring LLP. The Parties made opening presentations followed by the examination of fact witnesses - Messrs G\u00fcner, Sirin, Bozkurt, \u00c7i\u011fgin. Sarris and Partellas, followed by the conferencing of the Parties\u2019 forensic experts, and then subsequently by closing statements.\n\n75.\n\nAt the Preliminary Objections Hearing, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not rule on the Parties\u2019 requests to exclude evidence, but decide what weight, if any it would give to the disputed evidence. It also indicated that it was premature to decide on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Modification of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Orders of 6 April 2007 and 17 December 2008. In addition, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the possibility of hearing the oral testimony of Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Mr T\u00fcrkkan. The Tribunal requested for the Parties to revert with their views. The Respondent and the Claimant did so by letters of 25 November and 30 November 2009 respectively.\n\n76.\n\nOn 30 November 2009, the Tribunal informed the Parties that its intention was to hold a three-day hearing in Paris for the examination of Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Mr T\u00fcrkkan, subject to the Parties\u2019 definitive position on the calling and cross-examination of the witnesses. The Tribunal attached a letter from ICSID outlining a procedure to follow for ICSID to facilitate a hearing of the witnesses, to the effect that relevant authorities be notified of the details of a video-conference or in-person hearing. The Parties subsequently confirmed that they wished to examine the witnesses and that they were prepared to accept the procedure proposed by ICSID. The Claimant requested that the Respondent take certain measures to confirm the immunity of the witnesses. The Respondent objected to this request.\n\n77.\n\nIn a Procedural Order of 18 December 2009, the Tribunal confirmed that it would hear Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan in person in Paris and Mr T\u00fcrkkan by video-conference from Amman, in a hearing during the period 23 March to 25 March 2010 (\"Continued Hearing\"). It rejected the Claimant\u2019s request concerning the immunity of the three witnesses, noting that the provisions of the ICSID Convention were sufficient in this regard, and directed the Parties to follow the procedure as outlined by ICSID. The Tribunal decided to disregard Ms Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan\u2019s witness statement, taking into account Article 4.8 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration. Finally, it decided to maintain Mr Ulusoy\u2019s Witness Statement on the record, indicating that it would decide in due course what weight (if any) to attach to it.\n\n78.\n\nOn 22 December 2009, the Claimant submitted further comments on the admissibility of the RWL Supplementary Report, arguing that it should be stricken from the record. The Respondent replied on 6 January 2010. By its Procedural Order of 7 January 2010, the Tribunal admitted the RWL Supplementary Report and allowed a responsive report by the Claimant\u2019s experts by 8 February 2010. The Claimant proceeded accordingly, filing a responsive report signed by Dr Aginsky and Mr Tytell dated 8 February 2010.\n\n79.\n\nOn 27 January 2010, owing to a disagreement between the Parties, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order concerning the conduct of the cross-examination of Mr T\u00fcrkkan by video-conference. The Tribunal confirmed its previous Order of 22 December 2009, and gave directions as to possible logistical solutions to certain technical difficulties.\n\n80.\n\nFollowing a request made by the Claimant, on 12 February 2010, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order confirming that the ICSID Convention\u2019s provisions on immunity (i.e. Articles 21 and 22) applied to Hakan Uzan\u2019s travel, over the period 22 March to 26 March 2010, to attend the hearing in Paris.\n\n81.\n\nOn 20 January and 24 February 2010, respectively, the Claimant submitted a second and third Witness Statement of Mr Faruk Ulusoy, requesting that the Tribunal take the latter into account when determining the weight to be given to Mr Ulusoy\u2019s first Witness Statement.\n\n82.\n\nOn 10 March 2010, the Respondent proposed that it file a short reply report to the Claimant\u2019s response of 8 February 2010 to the RWL Supplementary Report, and stated that it would in any event address these issues in its posthearing brief. The Respondent also attached certain new documents. The Claimant objected to the additional reply and the accompanying exhibits.\n\n83.\n\nThe Continued Hearing (with Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan attending in person in Paris, and Mr T\u00fcrkkan attending by way of video-conference from Amman) was held over the period 23 March to 25 March 2010 as stated above. The Parties had teams of legal counsel both in Paris and in Amman, with the main team, the Tribunal and the Secretary sitting in Paris. Counsel for the Respondent, Mr Mark Howard Q.C., cross-examined the three witnesses. Telepresence, an advanced video-conference system, was used for the purposes of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s examination.\n\n84.\n\nFollowing the hearing, as the Parties were unable to agree on a time limit for the filing of their respective Post-Hearing Briefs, the Tribunal fixed the date for those briefs to be exchanged on 1 July 2010. It directed the Parties to include in their Post-Hearing Briefs a list of issues to be addressed, a list of principal cases relied upon, as well as a submission on costs.\n\n85.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, the Respondent submitted 16 new rebuttal exhibits concerning assertions made by Hakan Uzan and Mr T\u00fcrkkan at the Continued Hearing.\n\n86.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Parties filed their Post-Hearing Briefs, including their respective petitions for costs, on 1 July 2010 (\"R.PHM\" and \"C.PHM\"). The R.PHM was accompanied by additional legal authorities and one exhibit (R-1035). The C.PHM was accompanied by its Fourth Request for Production of Documents, relating to the merits and quantum.\n\n87.\n\nOn 24 August 2010, the Respondent filed further new exhibits concerning Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s testimony. The Claimant filed a response on 2 September 2010, requesting that the Tribunal disregard those exhibits. On 20 September 2010, the Tribunal, having regard to all the other evidence available on the record and also to the belated arrival of the new exhibits (i.e. after the completion of the evidentiary hearing and final submissions), issued a Procedural Order declining to admit the new exhibits.\n\n**IV. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Uzan family has been portrayed by the Claimant as coming from humble beginnings as emigrant farmers from Bosnia to Turkey in 1910. By 2001, they were recognised as among the wealthiest families in the world. According to the Claimant, the Uzans\u2019 net worth has been estimated at US$ 1.6 billion. Cem Uzan and his father Kemal Uzan, mother Melahat Uzan, brother Hakan Uzan and sister Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan owned some 130 business operations, spanning the globe and in a broad range of industries, including construction, media and telecommunications, sports and entertainment, and banking and finance.\n\n89.\n\nIn the early 1990s, having already purchased a prominent Turkish daily newspaper (Yeni Istanbul, 1964), and having established a strong foothold in the construction (Yapi ve Ticaret AS, 1965), banking (imar Bank, 1984; Ababank, 1985), and telecommunication sectors (Interstar, 1990), the Uzan family decided to invest in the Turkish electricity sector. The Uzan family\u2019s opportunity to enter the energy sector presented itself in 1993, when the Turkish Government decided to divest itself of its share ownerships in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n90.\n\nBy way of background, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez were founded in 1952 and 1955 respectively, both as vertically integrated (i.e. performing production, transmission, distribution and marketing functions) electrical utilities companies. From the 1950s to the 1990s, the Turkish Government progressively divested itself of a significant percentage of its equity in both \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. Over that period, they operated as privately owned entities, and were among the most successful electric utility companies in Turkey, carrying out the generation, distribution, transmission and marketing of electricity across four regions in the southern part of Turkey.\n\n91.\n\nIn 1992, the Turkish Government announced the block sale offering of its remaining shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in separate public tenders. The privatisation tenders for the block sale of the Government\u2019s remaining holdings in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez took place in early 1993. The winner of both tenders was Rumeli Elektrik Yatirim A.S. (\"Rumeli Elektrik\"), a company owned by Cem Uzan and his family. Following Rumeli Elektrik\u2019s purchase of the Turkish Government\u2019s shares, the Uzan family continued to increase their equity stake in the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez, eventually coming to own a majority of the shares in each company by the mid-1990s. Their ownership of a majority interest in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez was at all material times publicly known.\n\n92.\n\nIn 1998, as a result of a law requiring them to replace their existing concession contracts with new ones, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez signed new concession agreements with the Turkish Government (\"Concession Agreements\"). These Concession Agreements gave \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez the right to continue to operate the utilities for another 60 years, until 2058.\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent has alleged the following breaches of the Concession Agreements. Among other things, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez: (i) used a construction project known as the Berke Dam as a vehicle for improper fund transfers, by replacing the incumbent foreign contractor with one controlled by the Uzan family; (ii) improperly financed other companies outside of the electricity sector, which were controlled by the Uzan family; (iii) refused to take the necessary steps to provide full distribution services (low voltage lines) and non-discriminatory transmission services (high voltage lines) in their concession areas; (iv) violated the competition laws by frustrating the connection to the network of \"autoproducer\" companies that were legally generating their own electricity; (v) realised only a small fraction of the infrastructure investments the companies themselves included in the investment plans submitted to the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (\"Ministry\"); (vi) failed to provide reliable and uninterrupted electricity supply to their customers, including electricity-critical facilities such as schools and factories and so risked public safety and welfare; and (vii) refused to comply with the key provisions of Law No. 4628, Official Gazette No. 24335, 3 March 2001 (\"Electricity Market Law\"), notwithstanding their legal and contractual obligation to do so, thereby frustrating key elements of Turkey\u2019s regulatory reform of its electricity sector.\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that, in April 2002, Libananco was acquired by Ah Cenk T\u00fcrkkan, a close business associate of the Uzan family, on behalf of members of that family. The Claimant\u2019s case is that Libananco subsequently acquired shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez owned by members of the Uzan family, and that this process was completed by May 2003 (see paragraphs 136 to 139 below).\n\n95.\n\nOn 12 June 2003, five years after the Concession Agreements had been entered into, representatives from the Ministry assembled armed members of the Turkish military and police outside the headquarters of \u00c7EA\u015e. A similar force gathered outside Kepez the same day. These forces raided \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s facilities. Company personnel were removed from the respective premises, and movable and immovable properties were seized. At the same time, the Ministry served notices of cancellation of the Concession Agreements on \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n96.\n\nOn 8 September 2003, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez filed lawsuits in the Danistay (Turkey\u2019s highest administrative body, also known as the Council of State), challenging the cancellation of the Concession Agreements. On 31 May 2005, the 13th Panel of the Danistay issued a decision affirming the Ministry\u2019s grounds for cancellation of the Concession Agreements. It held that *\"[n]o illegality has been established in deciding to terminate under Article 19 setting out the termination of the Agreement due to the fault of the companies]\".* \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez appealed the decision to the appellate body of the Danistay, which dismissed the appeal.\n\n97.\n\nOn 23 February 2006, some three years after the seizure of the assets of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez by the Turkish Government, the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration against Turkey in the present proceedings.\n\n**V. THE ISSUES**\n-----------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is that, owing to the instability of the Turkish economy in 2000 and 2001 and Cem Uzan\u2019s decision to enter Turkish politics (which, according to Cem Uzan, left his and his family\u2019s business holdings potentially vulnerable to politically-motivated reprisals), the Uzans decided to acquire or establish an international holding company in a stable and reputable jurisdiction known for providing advantages to international investment companies.\n\n99.\n\nLibananco was thus acquired for and on behalf of Cem Uzan and his immediate family members, excluding his mother Melahat Uzan (i.e. his father Kemal Uzan, his brother Hakan Uzan and his sister Aysegul Uzan) (\"Immediate Family\") in April 2002.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case in relation to its acquisition of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares has, however, not remained constant.\n\n100.1 In its Request for Arbitration filed in February 2006 and the C.M filed in October 2007, the Claimant submitted that it acquired its first shares in Kepez in October 2002 and its first shares in \u00c7EA\u015e in November 2002. It then continued to acquire shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez over the following months, with its last acquisitions taking place in May 2003, one month before the Concession Agreements held by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez were cancelled by the Turkish Government. The Claimant submitted that this process was carried out by way of 32 separate transactions, each documented by a share transfer agreement (\"STA\"). The Claimant supported its case with additional documentary evidence in the form of, among other things: (i) a Share Acquisition Report allegedly dated 20 May 2003 (Exhibit H-61), which showed a number of transactions as having occurred between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003; (ii) Libananco\u2019s board minutes allegedly dating from 2002 and 2003, recording the alleged transactions in the same range of dates.\n\n100.2 In the C.CM in May 2009, the Claimant advanced a different position. It argued instead that the 32 STAs were merely expressions of intent to transfer and that the actual acquisition of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares by Libananco was achieved by two acts of delivery or *teslim* (a legal concept under Turkish law) in April 2003 and on 15 May 2003 respectively. Many of the documents tendered by the Claimant (see paragraph 100.1 above) were therefore no longer helpful (or relevant) to its case.\n\n101.\n\nIn any case, the Claimant claims that it was the owner of a majority of shares in each company by the end of May 2003, specifically owning 65.2 per cent of \u00c7EA\u015e' issued shares and 60 per cent of Kepez\u2019s issued shares.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s Concession Agreements have been cancelled outright and that its facilities have been seized and permanently taken over by the Respondent. Consequently, and based on these alleged facts, the Claimant has sought determinations from the Tribunal as follows.\n\n(a) The Respondent has expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment in violation of Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n(b) The Respondent has treated the Claimant\u2019s investment unfairly and inequitably in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n(c) The Respondent has failed to meet the obligations it entered into with regard to the Claimant\u2019s investment in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n(d) The Respondent has failed to provide the Claimant\u2019s investment with the most constant protection and security in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n(e) The Respondent has impaired the Claimant\u2019s investment by unreasonable measures in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n103.\n\nThe thrust of the Respondent\u2019s case on the merits, which is not set out in any great detail (since, as explained below, this Award decides only certain Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections raised by the Respondent) is as follows.\n\n103.1 Although \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez had indeed been successful electricity concessionaires for several decades, their performance deteriorated sharply once the Uzan family acquired majority shareholding and control. In particular, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez breached their obligations under the respective Concession Agreements on many occasions and refused to cooperate with the Turkish authorities.\n\n103.2 \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez did not comply with the Electricity Market Law and its implementing regulations - including, in particular, the requirement that \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez and other entities transfer State-owned transmission facilities in their territories to a new independent entity that would ensure non-discriminatory access to an integrated single Turkish transmission network. This refusal to comply on the part of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez undermined a pillar of Turkey\u2019s reform of its electricity sector.\n\n103.3 In the face of this refusal to comply, and other longstanding breaches of \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s obligations under the Concession Agreements, the Respondent had ample reason to terminate the respective Concession Agreements, which it validly did in June 2003.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent has raised certain jurisdictional objections to the Claimant\u2019s claim, and has submitted that, for the reasons set out below, the Claimant\u2019s action should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. These are as follows.\n\n(a) Libananco has failed to prove that it owned \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares before 12 June 2003, the date of the alleged expropriation.\n\n(b) Libananco was not an \"Investor\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the ECT because it is the *alter ego* of various Turkish nationals. The facts in the present case accordingly call for the corporate veil to be pierced.\n\n(c) There was no \"Investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention because Libananco\u2019s alleged ownership of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez fails each branch of the five-factor jurisdictional test under the ICSID Convention as established by case law and commentary (i.e. the \"Investment\" must: (i) have a certain duration; (ii) provide regular profit and return; (iii) entail risk; (iv) entail a substantial commitment by the investor; and (v) contribute significantly to the host State\u2019s development).\n\n(d) Libananco\u2019s alleged acquisition of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares was invalid and/or illegal under Turkish and Cypriot law, and is therefore not an \"Investment\" protected by the ECT or the ICSID Convention. The illegality of the alleged transactions deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n(e) Libananco\u2019s claims do not satisfy express conditions of the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration because: (i) pursuant to ECT Annex ID, Turkey has withheld consent to arbitrate issues that have already been litigated before its national courts; and (ii) pursuant to Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention, Turkey filed a notification upon acceding to the ICSID Convention to the effect that only disputes arising directly out of investment activities which have obtained necessary permission in accordance with Turkish laws on foreign capital would be subject to the jurisdiction of ICSID.\n\n(f) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over claims arising before 4 July 2001, the date the ECT entered into force with respect to Turkey, e.g. claims brought by Libananco in relation to the Electricity Market Law.\n\n(g) Additionally, the Claimant\u2019s claim is inadmissible for the following reasons: (i) Libananco is not entitled to the benefits of the ECT pursuant to Article 17(1) of the ECT because it is owned by non-Cypriots and conducts no business in Cyprus; (ii) Turkey is entitled to deny the benefits of the ECT to Libananco pursuant to Article 17(2) of the ECT because Libananco is a national of a state with which it has no diplomatic relations; (iii) all of the Claimant\u2019s claims other than for expropriation are inadmissible pursuant to Article 24(3)(c) of the ECT because Turkey considered the measures in question *\"necessary... for the maintenance ofpublic order\"',* and (iv) the present proceedings are an abuse of process.\n\n105.\n\nThe present Award addresses the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections (i.e. certain of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections which the Tribunal determined were appropriate for preliminary determination). These are set out below.\n\n105.1 First, whether Libananco in fact owned \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares before 12 June 2003 (the date of the alleged expropriation). This is the key issue in the present case. It is common ground between the Parties that Libananco would have no standing to prosecute the present arbitration if it did not own shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez on or before 12 June 2003. The Claimant\u2019s position is that Libananco owned the shares in question before 12 June 2003. The Respondent\u2019s position is that Libananco did not acquire the shares in question on or before 12 June 2003, and that the Claimant has failed to prove the facts which it asserts to be true.\n\n105.2 Second, whether Libananco is an \"Investor\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the ECT. The difference between the Parties here is whether Libananco has any real corporate existence of its own, or if it is merely an *alter ego* of the Uzan family, and therefore does not qualify as a foreign investor entitled to maintain claims under the ICSID Convention and the ECT. The Respondent submits that Libananco\u2019s corporate veil should be pierced for the reason given above. The Claimant\u2019s position, on the other hand, is that Libananco is plainly an \"Investor\" within the meaning of the ECT and the ICSID Convention by virtue of its place of incorporation and hence its nationality. The Claimant argues, among other things, that the Respondent has not shown the existence of any rule of corporate nationality that would override the plain definition of \"Investor\" for the purposes of the ECT and ICSID Convention, or that there is any international law doctrine of \"veil-piercing\" that would take precedence in the present circumstances.\n\n105.3 Third, whether Libananco\u2019s claims satisfy express conditions of Turkey\u2019s consent to arbitration. Here, the Respondent relies principally on Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT which states that:\n\n*\"Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give... unconditional consent [to international arbitration] where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute [to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party to the dispute]\".*\n\nTurkey is a Contracting Party listed in Annex ID to the ECT. The Respondent\u2019s position is that the subject matter of the present dispute has already been submitted to the Turkish courts by the Uzan family and related entities, and that the latter were unsuccessful in their litigation. For that reason, the Respondent has not consented to arbitrate the present dispute. The Claimant\u2019s response is that Libananco itself has never submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Turkish courts, and therefore has never been a party in any Turkish litigation; further, the disputes before the Turkish courts referred to by the Respondent are not the same as the present dispute before this Tribunal.\n\n105.4 Fourth, whether Libananco is entitled to the benefits of the ECT under its Article 17. The Respondent relies on Articles 17(1) and 17(2) of the ECT to argue that Libananco is not entitled to the benefits of the ECT. In broad terms, these provisions deny the benefits of the ECT to: (i) a legal entity which has \"no substantial business activities\" in the country in which it is organised, and is owned by citizens or nationals of a \"third state\" (Article 17(1) of the ECT); and (ii) an investment which is one belonging to an \"Investor of a third state\" in respect of which the denying Contracting Party does not maintain a diplomatic relationship (Article 17(2)(a) of the ECT). The Respondent has accordingly submitted that: (i) Libananco has never had any substantial business activities in Cyprus; (ii) Libananco is owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a \"third state\"; and (iii) that Turkey and Cyprus do not maintain diplomatic relations. The crux of the Claimant\u2019s position is simply that both Cyprus and Turkey are Contracting Parties to the ECT, and consequently neither is a \"third state\".\n\n**VI. RELIEFS REQUESTED BY THE PARTIES**\n----------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nOn the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections set out above, the Claimant has sought the following orders from the Tribunal:\n\n(a) a denial of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on the timing of the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez bearer share certificates;\n\n(b) a declaration that the Respondent\u2019s allegations of fraud and forgery regarding this dispute are unsubstantiated, and that the Claimant did in fact acquire a substantial and controlling interest in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez prior to 12 June 2003;\n\n(c) a dismissal of the Respondent\u2019s other Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections;\n\n(d) the advancement of this arbitration forward as expeditiously as possible to the remaining jurisdictional objections, and the merits and quantum phase; and\n\n(e) an order for the Respondent to bear all the Claimant\u2019s costs and expenses relating to the present phase of the arbitration (i.e. the determination of the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections).\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant has additionally requested for the following reliefs:\n\n(a) damages in an amount to be quantified in the damages phase of the arbitration;\n\n(b) all costs associated with this arbitration;\n\n(c) all attorney\u2019s fees and expenses;\n\n(d) pre-award and post-award interest, as appropriate in light of the other items of relief requested, at the highest rate; and\n\n(e) such other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, requests that the Tribunal issue an Award:\n\n(a) dismissing the Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety;\n\n(b) declaring that Libananco has asserted its claims in bad faith and on the basis of fraudulent documents; and\n\n(c) awarding the Respondent all the expenses and costs associated with these proceedings, including interest.\n\n**VII. THE APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAs agreed by the Parties, the Tribunal must analyse its jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n110.\n\nThe relevant provisions of Article 26 of the ECT state:\n\n*\"(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.*\n\n*(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.*\n\n*(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each* *Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2) (a) or (b).*\n\n*(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.*\n\n*...*\n\n*(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph 2(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:*\n\n*(\u0430) (i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment* *Disputes established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the \"ICSID Convention\"), if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID Convention; or*\n\n*...*\n\n*5(a) The consent given in paragraph (3) together with the written consent of the Investor given pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for:*\n\n*(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules.*\n\n*(ii) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, 10 June 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the \"New York Convention\")...*\n\n*(\u0431) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law\".*\n\n111.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention states:\n\n*\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\".*\n\n112.\n\nAdditionally, it is common ground between the Parties that Turkish law applies to the issue of whether (and when) Libananco acquired the shares in question and thus had an \"Investment\" under Article 26(1) of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In interpreting the provisions of the ECT and the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has considered previous ICSID decisions and awards relied on by the Parties.\n\n113.\n\nAccordingly, in this Award, the Tribunal will apply the provisions of the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal will also apply Turkish law (evidence of which has been given by both Parties) to determine whether there has been a valid transfer of the shares in question to Libananco as this is a question of domestic law.\n\n**VIII. BURDEN AND STANDARD OF PROOF**\n--------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to consider the issue of which Party bears the burden of proof in relation to the facts and assertions advanced by each of them. It is necessary to set the stage at the outset since the Parties differ fundamentally as to the issue of burden of proof.\n\n***A. The Claimant\u2019s position***\n--------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimant, in the C.M, made the argument initially that the Tribunal should, at the jurisdictional phase, accept *pro tern* the facts alleged by the Claimant as substantiation for its claims of breach. In support of this proposition, the Claimant cited the case of *Kardassopoulos v Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18 (Decision on Jurisdiction of 6 July 2007) (quoting *Siemens v Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, (Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 August 2004, at paragraph 180), at paragraph 103:\n\n*\"At this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the claims under the Treaty made by [Claimant] are correct. This is a matter for the merits. The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, if Claimant\u2019s allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider them\".*\n\nHowever, in the C.Rej, the Claimant recognised and admitted that the latter submission had been made at a time when the Respondent had not yet raised any objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The Claimant has since expressly recognised that it bears the burden of demonstrating its timely ownership of the bearer share certificates in question, and has indeed put forward substantial documentary, testimonial and forensic evidence in that regard in the course of these proceedings.\n\n116.\n\nHowever, in relation to the remaining three Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, the Claimant has pleaded the principle of *actori incumbit probatio* (i.e. he who asserts must prove). Specifically, the Claimant has submitted that the Respondent bears the burden of proving the legal theories on which it relies and that the latter are applicable to the facts in the present case. The Claimant\u2019s argument is this.\n\n116.1 With respect to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that Libananco\u2019s legal personality has been \"misused\" for purposes of perpetrating a \"fraud\" (i.e. the second Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection set out in paragraph 105.2 above), it is a general principle of law that *\"good faith is to be presumed, whilst an abuse of right is not\"1* Thus, *\"It rests with the party who states that there has been such a misuse to prove his statement\"2*\n\n116.2 With respect to the Respondent\u2019s contention that it has limited its consent to arbitration of the present dispute (i.e. the third Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection set out in paragraph 105.3 above), general principles of law dictate that:\n\n*\"whoever will derive to himself any advantage by the exception to a general rule, or by interference with the generally acknowledged rights of another, is bound to prove that his case is completely within the exception\"3*\n\nAccordingly, it is for the Respondent to prove that it has limited its consent to arbitration.\n\n116.3 In relation to the Respondent\u2019s argument that it is entitled to invoke Article 17 of the ECT to deny Libananco the benefits of Part III of the treaty (i.e. the fourth Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection set out in paragraph 105.4 above), this constitutes an affirmative defence on the merits. In *Generation Ukraine v Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9 (Award dated 16 September 2003), it was held by the tribunal that (at paragraph 15.7):\n\n*\"In the absence of any competing considerations advanced by the Respondent, the Tribunal is satisfied that \"third country control\" over Generation Ukraine is a prerequisite for any purported invocation of Article 1(2) by the Respondent. Furthermore,* ***the burden of proof*** *to establish the factual basis of the \"third country control\", together with* *the other conditions,* ***falls upon the State as the party invoking the \"right to deny\"*** *conferred by Article 1(2)*\n\n(emphasis added by Claimant)\n\nThe Claimant also cited the case of *AMTO LLC v Ukraine,* Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Arbitration No. 080/2005, Final Award (2008), which it argued reached a similar conclusion (at paragraphs 64 to 65):\n\n*\"[W]hen a respondent alleges that the claimant is of the class of Investors only entitled to defeasible protection, so that the respondent can exercise its power to deny, then the burden passes to the respondent to prove the factual prerequisites of Article 17 on which it relies\".*\n\nCiting Bin Cheng, ***General Principles of Law as Applies by International Courts and Tribunals***  (Cambridge 2006) at 305.\n\nCiting Bin Cheng, ***General Principles of Law as Applies by International Courts and Tribunals***  (Cambridge 2006) at 305 (quoting ***Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia*** (F.R.G. v. Pol.), 1926 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 7, at 30 (1926))\n\nCiting Bin Cheng, ***General Principles of Law as Applies by International Courts and Tribunals***  (Cambridge 2006) at 306 (quoting ***Jay Treaty (Art. VII) Arb*** (1794) 4 INT. ADJ. M.S. 372 at 407).\n\n117.\n\nFurther, with respect to the Respondent\u2019s submission that the equitable doctrine of veil-piercing applies in the present case such that Libananco does not qualify as an \"Investor\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and the ECT (i.e. the second Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection set out in 105.2 above), the Claimant has contended that since the Respondent\u2019s arguments here are premised upon the existence of \"fraud or other serious wrongdoing\", a heightened standard of proof should apply. The Claimant has cited, among other things, the following authorities in support of this proposition:\n\n(a) the *Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. US.),* 1996 I.C.J. Rep. 856, (Separate Opinion of Judge Rosalyn Higgins) *[\"Oil Platforms case\")* where it was observed that: *\"the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on* and\n\n(b) the decision in *Siag and Vecchi v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15 (Award dated 11 May 2009), where the tribunal reasoned as follows (at paragraphs 325 to 326):\n\n*\"For reasons summarised above, the Claimants have submitted that Egypt must prove its Lebanese nationality objection to a heightened standard ofproof. Chief among the reasons cited by Claimants is that Egypt\u2019s Lebanese nationality application rests upon allegations of fraud, and that claims of such nature are typically held to a heavy standard of proof. The standard suggested by the Claimants was the American standard of \"clear and convincing evidence,\" that being somewhere between the traditional civil standard of \"preponderance of the evidence\" (otherwise known as the \"balance of probabilities\"), and the criminal standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt.\"*\n\n*The Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submission.* ***It is common in most legal systems for serious allegations such as fraud to be held to a high standard of proof The same is the case in international proceedings,*** *as can be seen in the cases cited by* *Claimants, among them the Award of the ICSID Tribunal in Wena Hotels. Egypt\u2019s principal submission was that the burden of proof was on Mr Siag, a submission which the Tribunal has rejected so far as the proof of fraud or other serious misconduct is concerned. Egypt did not submit that, if it were required to prove fraud, it should be held to a lesser standard than that argued by the Claimants.* ***The Tribunal accepts that the applicable standard of proof is greater than the balance of probabilities but less than beyond reasonable doubt. The term favoured by Claimants is \"clear and convincing evidence.\" The Tribunal agrees with that test\".***\n\n(emphasis added by Claimant, citations omitted)\n\n***B. The Respondent\u2019s position***\n----------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is simply that the Claimant bears the burden of proof with respect to all elements required to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (including, among other things, that Libananco was an \"Investor\" under the ECT and the ICSID Convention and that it owned a qualifying \"Investment\" under those instruments at all material times).\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent has taken the position that, during an initial jurisdictional phase, a *prima facie* case on the merits may suffice to overcome an objection that a claimant has failed to state a cognisable claim, since a tribunal will wish to avoid pre-judging disputed factual issues on the merits in adjudicating such an objection. However, with respect to jurisdictional facts (such as the existence or lawful ownership of an investment), mere allegations are insufficient. These facts must be proven, and the burden to do so rests squarely on a claimant. In support of this proposition, the Respondent has cited, among other things, the *Oil Platforms case* (Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, at paragraphs 32 to 34):\n\n*\"The only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether the claims of Iran are sufficiently plausible based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept pro tern the facts as alleged by Iran to be true and in that light to interpret Articles I, IV and X for jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of Iran\u2019s claims offact there could occur a violation of one or more of them.*\n\n*... The Court should thus see if, on the facts as alleged by Iran, the United States actions complained of might violate the Treaty articles.*\n\n*Nothing in this approach puts at risk the obligation of the Court to keep separate the jurisdictional and merits phases....What is for the merits... is to determine what exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of for example, Article X; and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation, lying in Article XX or elsewhere. In short, it is at the merits that one sees \"whether there really has been a breach.\"*\n\n(citations omitted)\n\n120.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the standard of proof with respect to the determination of the second Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection (set out in paragraph 105.2 above) should be heightened, the Respondent has submitted, among other things, that the Claimant\u2019s contention that a heightened standard *\"is common practice in municipal legal systems\"* is not correct. In civil law systems, there is no special standard of proof applicable in cases involving fraud. The Respondent has submitted that, under English law, the standard of proof does not change simply because fraud has been alleged. It says the decision of the English House of Lords in *In re Doherty* [2008] UKHL 33 is instructive (at paragraphs 25 and 28):\n\n*\"Fraud is usually less likely than negligence... [T]his does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher...*\n\n*[I]n some contexts a court or tribunal has to look at the facts more critically or more anxiously than in others before it can be satisfied to the requisite standard.*  *The standard itself is, however, finite and unvarying.* *Situations which make such heightened examination necessary may be the inherent unlikelihood of the occurrence taking place..., the seriousness of the allegation to be proved or, in some cases, the consequences which could follow from acceptance of proof of the relevant fact\".*\n\n(citations omitted, underline added by Claimant)\n\n***C. Analysis***\n-----------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in relation to the issue of whether Libananco acquired timely ownership of the share certificates in question (i.e. the first Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection set out in paragraph 105.1 above), it is now common ground between the Parties that the Claimant has the burden of proof. However, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal confirms its view that it is not required to make a *pro tern* assumption of the truth of a fact if the evidence of that fact has been fully presented, and sufficient evidence exists for the Tribunal to make an informed and dispositive finding at this stage.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal is assisted by the following remarks of the tribunal in *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5 (Award dated 15 April 2009) *(\"Phoenix Action\")* (at paragraphs 60 to 61):\n\n*\"In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it cannot take all the facts alleged by the Claimant as granted facts... but must look into the role these facts play either at the jurisdictional level or at the merits level.*\n\n*If the alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the relevant BIT, they have indeed to be accepted as such* *at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained or not at the merits level.*  ***On the contrary, if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage.***  *For* *example, in the present case, all findings of the Tribunal to the effect that there exists a protected investment must be proven, unless the question could not be ascertained at that stage, in which case it should be joined to the merits\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n123.\n\nIn *PSEG Global Inc and Konya Ilgin Elektrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5 (Decision on Jurisdiction of 4 June 2004) *(\"PSEG\"),* the parties made similar arguments concerning the *prima facie* test for jurisdictional challenges. The tribunal stated that (at paragraph 64):\n\n*\"The Tribunal is aware that the* *prima facie* *test has been applied in a number of cases, including ICSID cases... and that as a general approach to jurisdictional decisions it is a reasonable one. However,* ***this is a test that is always case-specific. If, as in the present case, the parties have views which are so different about the facts and the meaning of the dispute, it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal to rely on the assumption that the facts as presented by the Claimants are correct. \"***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *PSEG* that whether or not the *prima facie* test should be applied when deciding a jurisdictional challenge is case-specific. In this case, the Tribunal made the decision for a bifurcation of proceedings to hear the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections first, on the basis that any of these objections, if successful, would be dispositive of the case. Full evidence and argument on all factual and legal issues relating to the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections has been received and heard by the Tribunal. It would wholly defeat the purpose of bifurcation if the Tribunal were to now assess only whether the Claimant has provided *prima facie* evidence of ownership of the share certificates, and allow the proceedings to move to the merits on that basis, leaving the question of the substantive ownership of the shares still to be determined.\n\n125.\n\nIn relation to the Claimant\u2019s contention that there should be a heightened standard of proof for allegations of \"fraud or other serious wrongdoing\", the Tribunal accepts that fraud is a serious allegation, but it does not consider that this (without more) requires it to apply a heightened standard of proof. While agreeing with the general proposition that *\"the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on\"* (see paragraph 117(a) above), this does not necessarily entail a higher standard of proof. It may simply require more persuasive evidence, in the case of a fact that is inherently improbable, in order for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the burden of proof has been discharged.\n\n126.\n\nIn any event, the question of the applicable standard of proof for allegations of \"fraud or other serious wrongdoing\" and the other disputed issues set out in paragraph 116 above (as to which Party should bear the burden of proof in relation to the second, third and fourth Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections) are of academic interest only. As will be apparent from the Tribunal\u2019s observations and findings below, the second, third and fourth Preliminary Objections (set out in paragraphs 105.2, 105.3 and 105.4 above respectively) are not dispositive in these proceedings. Accordingly, the question of burden of proof and/or the applicable standard of proof in respect of these Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections does not arise for consideration. Although the Parties have raised interesting and novel points, the Tribunal does not consider that it is necessary to say more than it already has at this stage. For the avoidance of doubt, the respective submissions of the Parties not analysed by the Tribunal here are neither accepted nor rejected in the circumstances.\n\n**IX. HAS THE CLAIMANT PROVED THAT IT OWNED \u00c7EA\u015e AND KEPEZ SHARES BEFORE 12 JUNE 2003?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the merits depends on whether Libananco owned \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares at the time of the alleged expropriation (i.e. 12 June 2003).\n\n128.\n\nIn order to establish jurisdiction, the Claimant must prove that it owned \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares during the time at which it claims the acts constituting a violation of the ECT were committed by the Respondent. In *Aram Sabet et al* v. *Islamic Republic of Iran - Bonyad-E-Mostazafan,* Iran-US Claims Tribunal Case No. 815-816-817, Award No. 593-815/816/817-2, 29 June 1999, the tribunal held (at paragraph 55 of the award) that: *\"In order to succeed in their claims, the Claimants must prove, as a preliminary matter, that, during the relevant period, they owned the shares that they claim the Respondents expropriated\".*\n\n129.\n\nThe point is further underscored by the award in *Saluka Investment BV (the Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, where the tribunal similarly held that its jurisdiction would be limited to claims arising after Saluka acquired the shares from its parent, Nomura. It was accordingly held that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction in respect of damage suffered by Nomura before October 1998 when the bulk of the shares became vested in the claimant, Saluka.\n\n130.\n\nA similar conclusion follows from the jurisdictional provisions of investment treaties, including the ECT and the ICSID Convention. Article 1(6) of the ECT defines \"Investment\" as *\"every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor\".* Although, the ECT speaks of ownership and control (both direct and indirect), this case has been argued by the Parties on the sole basis of ownership (i.e. it is not part of the Claimant\u2019s case that it had control but not ownership of the share certificates in question). Accordingly, unless Libananco \"owned\" \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates at the time of the events giving rise to the present dispute, there can be no jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ECT, which provides for arbitration of *\"[disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former\".*\n\n131.\n\nIn short, in order to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimant must show that it owned the shares in question on or before 12 June 2003 (i.e. the date of the Respondent\u2019s alleged expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s ownership interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez).\n\n132.\n\nAs this issue turns largely on the facts, this section will be organized differently from the rest of the Award. The Tribunal will first set out the Parties\u2019 respective positions before discussing the factual evidence (i.e. the Witness Statements and oral testimony), followed by an analysis of and/or observations on the expert evidence (i.e. forensic analysis of the documentary, computer and audio evidence). The Tribunal will then discuss the law on the transfer of bearer shares, sehing out the Parties\u2019 positions where relevant. As the factual and expert evidence is voluminous, the Tribunal will only set out the salient parts of the various witnesses\u2019 (both factual and expert) evidence.\n\n***A. The Claimant\u2019s case***\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Background to Libananco\u2019s creation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is that the instability of the Turkish economy during the economic crisis of 2000 and 2001 prompted the Uzan family to refocus their business strategies by reducing their domestic operations and concentrating on foreign expansion. It was said that the Uzan family was deeply concerned that the business environment in Turkey would continue to deteriorate, and therefore made a decision to internationalise their business holdings.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal was also told that, around the same time, Cem Uzan had decided to enter Turkish politics. Cem Uzan was the founder and leader of the Gene Parti, a national political party in Turkey that sought to challenge the ruling party. It was said that, owing to the \"rough and tumble\" nature of the Turkish political arena, Cem Uzan\u2019s and his family\u2019s business holdings were potentially vulnerable to politically-motivated reprisals.\n\n135.\n\nFor those main reasons, the Uzan family established Libananco as an investment vehicle. On 1 April 2002, Libananco, a limited liability company domiciled in Nicosia and organised in accordance with applicable Cypriot laws, was acquired by Ali Cenk Turkkan, a close business associate of the Uzan family on behalf of members of the Uzan family. On that same date, Libananco\u2019s current Board of Directors was also established, comprising two directors in addition to Mr Turkkan himself: Antonia Kyriakou and Andreas Partellas, both of whom were Cypriot citizens residing in Nicosia. The Claimant\u2019s case is that Mr Turkkan purchased Libananco in April 2002 and that this supports its case that Libananco went on to acquire a majority of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez before June 2003.\n\n**2. Libananco\u2019s alleged investment in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAt that time of its acquisition by Mr T\u00fcrkkan in April 2002, Libananco did not have substantial capitalisation or assets. It was therefore intended that Libananco would be capitalised through its acquisition of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares owned by members of the Uzan family.\n\n137.\n\nThe current version of the Claimant\u2019s case is that Libananco acquired legal ownership of those shares in April and May 2003. Its last acquisitions took place in May 2003, one month before the companies\u2019 respective concession rights were cancelled by the Turkish Government.\n\n138.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the events leading up to Libananco\u2019s acquisitions were as follows.\n\n138.1 In October 2002, Hakan Uzan and Mr T\u00fcrkkan began executing written STAs to evidence the transfer of Hakan Uzan\u2019s shares to Libananco.\n\n138.2 In or around January 2003, the Uzan family agreed to sever their ownership interests in each other\u2019s businesses - essentially to enter into a family business \"divorce\". Accordingly, it was decided, among other things, that Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan would transfer their respective ownership interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Cem Uzan.\n\n138.3 It was further agreed that the severance of the ownership interests would be accomplished by capitalising Libananco with \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares, with members of the Uzan family signing STAs to memorialise their intent to make those transfers to Libananco. In addition, the Claimant explained that, as part of the family \"divorce\", certain intra-family agreements were entered into pursuant to which (among other things):\n\n(a) Kemal Uzan transferred shares in both \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Hakan Uzan;\n\n(b) Cem Uzan transferred shares in Kepez to Hakan Uzan; and\n\n(c) Cem Uzan transferred shares in \u00c7EA\u015e to Aysegul Uzan\n\n- these transfers *\"provided the predicate for moving forward with the share transfers to Libananco\"* (C.PHM, paragraph 43).\n\n138.4 Although the STAs were not necessary for a legally effective transfer under Turkish law (under Turkish law, a transfer of ownership of bearer share certificates is evidenced by, among other things, a transfer of possession to the buyer, i.e. *teslim),* Cem Uzan insisted on the STAs being executed as he believed that, since Libananco was no longer collectively owned by the family, it would be best for his father and siblings to create a record of the transfer to prevent potential disputes within the family in the future.\n\n138.5 Consequently, from February 2003 onwards, Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan (along with Mr T\u00fcrkkan, on behalf of Libananco), commenced the process of executing various STAs, thereby evidencing their intent to transfer their shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Libananco, which was by then beneficially owned by Cem Uzan. In total, 32 STAs were signed. All 32 STAs were exhibited by the Claimant.\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s ultimate position is therefore that Libananco was the owner of a majority of the shares in each company by 15 May 2003, specifically owning 65.2 per cent of \u00c7EA\u015e\u2019s issued shares and 60 per cent of Kepez\u2019s issued shares.\n\n**3. The \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates were delivered to Libananco no later than 15 May 2003**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThroughout the time the STAs were being executed, the share certificates that were to be acquired by Libananco were located in the Rumeli and Dogu\u015fbuildings (both of which were leased to Uzan group companies) in Mecidiyek\u00f3y, Istanbul and in the Uzan family\u2019s holiday home in Switzerland.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant accepted that a legal transfer of possession to Libananco or **teslim** in respect of the share certificates is a prerequisite to Libananco\u2019s ownership of the latter (see paragraph 392 below). The Claimant submitted that **teslim** was accomplished in relation to all the share certificates that it presently claims to own.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s arguments on *teslim* were as follows.\n\n142.1 With respect to the bearer shares located in Switzerland that were to be transferred to Libananco, these particular shares were owned by Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan, and held in custody by Hakan Uzan. The Claimant\u2019s case was that, in April 2003, Hakan Uzan called Mr T\u00fcrkkan in Jordan to inform him that ownership of those shares was being transferred to Libananco, and that he would maintain custody of those shares in Switzerland until such time as they could be delivered to Libananco. It was alleged that Mr T\u00fcrkkan accepted the shares on behalf of Libananco, and agreed with Hakan Uzan that they would remain in Switzerland until alternative arrangements could be made.\n\n142.2 With respect to the bearer share certificates located in Istanbul, it is alleged that they were wrapped in brown paper and labelled with the name \"Libananco\", and that this was sufficient to signify the transferors\u2019 intent to have those shares transferred to Libananco. In this connection, the Claimant alleges that, on 15 May 2003, Saylan \u00c7i\u011fgin (then the head of Cem Uzan\u2019s Star Media Group\u2019s legal department) went to the Rumeli and Dogu\u015f buildings in Istanbul and inspected the shares, thereby accepting them on behalf of Libananco (and thus fulfilling the element of transfer of possession or *teslim* required under Turkish law).\n\n142.3 Additionally, Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence was that Kemal Uzan telephoned him and told him to go to the garage in an office building in Ikitelli, Istanbul to receive delivery of the large denomination \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates on 15 May 2003.\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is therefore that, by no later than 15 May 2003, Libananco had become the owner of all of Hakan Uzan\u2019s and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan\u2019s share certificates in Switzerland and all of Hakan Uzan\u2019s, Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan\u2019s and Kemal Uzan\u2019s share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings.\n\n**4. Libananco\u2019s production of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates in Vienna in 2009 confirmed that it was most likely in possession of those shares before 12 June 2003**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nAlthough the Claimant accepted that **teslim** is required for the transfer of ownership under Turkish law, its position (notwithstanding that its witnesses have given substantial evidence in relation to the issue of whether **teslim** was accomplished in respect of the share certificates it claims to have owned before 12 June 2003) was that there is no requirement at this stage (i.e. the jurisdictional stage) to demonstrate the occurrence of *teslim.* It submitted that it was required only to show that Libananco acquired possession of the shares in question before 12 June 2003, and not *how* such acquisition occurred.\n\n145.\n\nIn that regard, the Claimant, in response to the Respondent\u2019s request for production of documents, delivered to the Das Safe facility in Vienna approximately 50,000 original share certificates of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez for forensic examination by the Parties\u2019 respective experts. On 20 February 2009, the Respondent completed its inspection of the share certificates at Das Safe. The Respondent did not dispute the authenticity of those share certificates, although it questioned, at an earlier stage, whether Libananco had possession of them in the first place, and, if so, whether such share certificates were authentic (see the Respondent\u2019s First Request for the Production of Documents filed on 18 December 2007).\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimant argued that the fact that it was able to produce the share certificates for inspection made it likely that it was in possession of those share certificates before 12 June 2003 for the reasons set out below.\n\n146.1 Historically, shares belonging to the Uzan family were kept in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings.\n\n146.2 As early as 3 July 2003, when the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (\"SDIF\")4 seized Imar Bank and began attachment proceedings against Uzan family companies, access to the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings was under very tight security given the presence of Imar Group Companies in those buildings.\n\n146.3 The SDIF took complete control over the entire Rumeli and Dogus Buildings on 14 February 2004, including the posting of security at the entrance and exit of the buildings and on each floor.\n\n146.4 Accordingly, no property, especially a large quantity of bearer share certificates worth millions of dollars, could have been removed from the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings after 14 February 2004 without the express authority of the SDIF.\n\n146.5 While low value and bulky share certificates were discovered in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings and confiscated, the high denomination share certificates that were produced for inspection in Vienna were not (since they were not in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings from the time the SDIF assumed control over the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings).\n\n146.6 It could therefore be concluded from the facts set out above that the high denomination share certificates which were produced in Vienna were most likely to have been removed from the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings before July 2003. This (together with the other evidence on the record) in turn supports the conclusion that Libananco took possession (and hence acquired ownership) of those share certificates before 12 June 2003.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the SDIF was authorised to locate and attach assets belonging to members of the Uzan family to satisfy the Uzan family\u2019s multi-billion-dollar debt to Turkey stemming from a fraud allegedly perpetrated through Imar Bank (a large Turkish financial institution), which was said to have been owned and controlled by the Uzan family from 1984 onwards.\n\n***B. The Respondent\u2019s case***\n------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s case is essentially that the Claimant has failed to show that Libananco owned the share certificates in question before 12 June 2003. Its main arguments are set out below under their respective headings.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s changing and conflicting stories**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the Claimant\u2019s changing and conflicting stories, the shifting testimony of its witnesses and the documents that it has produced (which contradict certain portions of the Claimant\u2019s own case) suggest that the case brought by the Claimant is fraudulent. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has presented four different (and sometimes contradictory) versions of its case. The key elements of each of these are set out in brief below.\n\n148.1 In the first version (as set out in the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration filed in February 2006), the Claimant portrayed itself as an independent and innocent Cypriot investor that had been caught in a domestic Turkish political crossfire. However, the Claimant subsequently abandoned that position, and now acknowledged that the real party in interest in the present dispute was Cem Uzan himself. In relation to the issue of Libananco\u2019s acquisition of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates, it was argued that these were progressively completed between October 2002 and May 2003.\n\n148.2 In the second version (as first set out in the C.M filed in October 2007), the Claimant dropped its earlier argument that it was an innocent investor unrelated to the Uzan family. Instead, it admitted that Libananco had been beneficially owned by Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family since 2002. Libananco was set up to be a conduit for the Uzan family\u2019s overseas investments. The Claimant also, at that stage, produced certain documents which were alleged to be contemporaneous, including the 32 STAs allegedly reflecting Libananco\u2019s purchase of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates from Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan in the form of 32 separate transactions occurring between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003.\n\n148.3 In the third version (as set out in the C.CM filed in May 2009), the Claimant sought to introduce a new fact, i.e. pursuant to an alleged \"family divorce\" which was consummated in January 2003, the Uzan family divided its assets among Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Cem Uzan, and agreed, in particular, that Cem Uzan would receive the family\u2019s stake in\u00a0\u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez and therefore would become the sole beneficial owner of Libananco, thus contradicting its earlier submission that Libananco was acquired by Mr T\u00fcrkkan for Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family. The Claimant also abandoned its earlier case where it argued that it acquired its interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez pursuant to 32 separate transactions as represented by the STAs previously produced. Instead, it argued that it only actually acquired the share certificates much later, in April and May 2003. The Claimant explained that the STAs were no more than mere \"expressions of intent\" to transfer; the actual acquisitions having taken place through two acts of *teslim'.* (i) a telephone call in April 2003 with respect to share certificates in Switzerland and (ii) Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s inspection of share certificates in istanbul. This third version of the Claimant\u2019s case contradicted the STAs themselves as well as the other documents produced by the Claimant.\n\n148.4 The fourth version (which was introduced in the Claimant\u2019s oral arguments in November 2009 and fleshed out by witness testimony in March 2010) was that the Uzan family had consummated a series of intrafamily transfers of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates on 3 April and 4 April 2003 pursuant to the alleged \"family divorce\". The Claimant introduced these intra-family transfers to explain why the percentage of \u00c7EA\u015e\u2019 and Kepez\u2019s share capital that Libananco allegedly received from Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan exceeded (and therefore did not match) the amounts owned by those individuals (according to records of dividends received by them). It was said that, pursuant to these intra-family transfers, Cem Uzan transferred shares to his siblings, who then transferred them to Libananco. The Respondent submitted that these intra-family transfers appeared late in the day, only some three years after the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration; and further, that they were circular and roundabout in nature since Cem Uzan was by then the sole beneficial owner of Libananco. The Respondent also noted that the Claimant\u2019s witness Hakan Uzan introduced a third (undocumented and previously unmentioned) act of *teslim -* Hakan Uzan claimed that his father Kemal Uzan telephoned him on 15 May 2003 and instructed him to go to the garage in an office building in ikitelli (that same day) to receive delivery of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the changing stories were a clear sign of falsehoods on the part of the Claimant. In particular, the Respondent submitted that the changes in the Claimant\u2019s case were telling in relation to the manner in which the shares were allegedly transferred to Libananco.\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s key jurisdictional documents were backdated**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the key jurisdictional documents relied on by the Claimant were backdated and created no earlier than 2005. It is argued by the Respondent that key documents represented by the Claimant to be \"originals\" dating from 2002 to 2003 were actually backdated reproductions created only after November 2005. In that regard, the Respondent advanced, among others, the following arguments.\n\n150.1 The 32 STAs which bore various dates between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003 that were relied on by the Claimant could not, based on the evidence given by its forensic experts, have been signed in the sequence that their dates implied.\n\n150.2 The forensic evidence showed, among other things, that the signatures of Kemal Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan on the STA were forgeries, and that at least seven of the STAs had been stamped no earlier than 2005.\n\n150.3 In any event, all the STAs that were produced were not original documents (although the Claimant initially represented them as such) as they were printed and signed by Mr T\u00fcrkkan in 2005.\n\n150.4 Board minutes tendered by the Claimant purporting to record Libananco\u2019s acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez had been printed with ink that was not commercially available before August 2005.\n\n150.5 In any event, Mr T\u00fcrkkan admitted that many of the minutes were printed in 2005, so the documents tendered were not in fact original (although the Claimant initially represented them as such).\n\n150.6 In relation to the Instrument of Transfer allegedly dated 1 April 2002 tendered by the Claimant (which documents the transfer of ownership of Libananco to Mr T\u00fcrkkan), the Respondent\u2019s forensic experts detected an anti-counterfeiting code on one of the pages, proving that it could not have been printed before 2007.\n\n150.7 Mr T\u00fcrkkan likewise admitted that the Instrument of Transfer was only printed and signed in 2007, so the version tendered was not an original document (although the Claimant initially represented it as such).\n\n**3. Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s account of acquiring Libananco in April 2002 was flawed and contradicted by other evidence on the record**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s account of acquiring Libananco in April 2002 was contradicted by other available evidence. Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was that, on 1 April 2002, Prontoservus Ltd (\"Prontoservus\"), a company associated with the law firm Polakis Sarris & Co (of which the Claimant\u2019s witness Polakis Sarris is a partner), transferred 100 per cent of Libananco\u2019s shares to him. This transfer was memorialised in an Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002 and resignation letters from the directors of Prontoservus. It was submitted that, if Mr T\u00fcrkkan did not in fact purchase Libananco on 1 April 2002 as alleged by the Claimant, then the Claimant\u2019s entire case would collapse. This is because the alleged purchase of Libananco was central to its account of how, when and why it came to acquire shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. The Respondent submitted that parts of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s Witness Statements explaining his acquisition of Libananco were false, including the following assertions made by him.\n\n151.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed in his First Witness Statement that he was looking for a Cypriot firm to help him acquire an investment vehicle, and he chose Partellas & Kiliaris *\"after identifying [the] firm based on its website\".* The Respondent submitted that this was not possible since the firm did not have a website in March 2002.\n\n151.2 On the day that Libananco was allegedly purchased by Mr T\u00fcrkkan (i.e. 1 April 2002), Mr T\u00fcrkkan *\"participated, by telephone\"* in a meeting of the new Board of Directors. The Respondent submitted, based on the evidence given by the Claimant\u2019s witnesses, that no Board meeting was in fact held on 1 April 2002, and that the minutes of that meeting were created for tactical purposes.\n\n151.3 Shortly after the alleged telephone conference, Mr T\u00fcrkkan travelled to Nicosia, Cyprus *\"on a non-stop Royal Jordanian flight from Amman and stayed two nights at the Nicosia Hilton\",* where he allegedly met Mr Antonis Partellas (a Cypriot accountant) for the first time. The Respondent pointed out that the Nicosia Hilton had no record of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s alleged stay in April 2002 and that Royal Jordanian did not operate a non-stop flight from Amman, Jordan to Lamaca, Cyprus on 1 April 2002.\n\n**4. The May 2003 dividend records for \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez showed that members of the Uzan family and not Libananco owned the shares**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent argued that records of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez dividend payments in May 2003 showed that the Uzans owned the shares that are alleged to have been owned by Libananco at that time.\n\n153.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent contended that the evidence demonstrated that Libananco received none of the dividends of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez which were paid beginning on 20 May 2003. Instead, all of the dividends that were supposed to have been received by Libananco went to members of the Uzan family or to Turkish companies which they controlled.\n\n153.1 The istanbul Stock Exchange Settlement and Custody Bank, Inc. (\"Depository Bank\") prepared a report (\"Depository Bank Report\"), submitted by the Respondent together with its Supplement to Counter-Memorial (filed on 3 March 2009), which confirmed that Libananco did not collect any dividends from either \u00c7EA\u015e or Kepez on 20 May 2003 (or thereafter) even though approximately 99 per cent of \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s shareholders collected those dividends. Instead, the dividends were collected by members of the Uzan family.\n\n153.2 The Depository Bank Report showed that members of the Uzan family collected the dividends on all of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates that Libananco produced in Vienna.\n\n153.3 The owners of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez were the members of the Uzan family who collected the May 2003 dividends and not Libananco.\n\n154.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submitted that Libananco owned no shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez as at 20 May 2003.\n\n**5. The Claimant failed to prove** ***teslim*** **(i.e. the legal transfer of possession) in relation to the share certificates allegedly acquired by Libananco**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent emphasised that the Claimant failed to demonstrate a legal transfer of possession in favour of Libananco in relation to the share certificates in question. This concept is known as *teslim,* and is one of the requirements for a legally effective transfer of ownership.\n\n155.1 The alleged delivery of share certificates in Switzerland in April 2003 was put forward based only on the testimony of Hakan Uzan and Mr T\u00fcrkkan, who claimed to have effected delivery over the telephone, with Hakan Uzan in istanbul and Mr T\u00fcrkkan in Jordan. None of this was recorded in writing. Notably, at the hearing, Mr T\u00fcrkkan conceded that no *teslim* actually occurred with respect to the share certificates located in Switzerland.\n\n155.2 The only witness who allegedly had personal knowledge of the 15 May 2003 delivery-by-inspection at the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings in istanbul was Saylan \u00c7i\u011fgin. who supposedly carried out the inspection. Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin testified that he deliberately destroyed the only document that he ever claimed to possess in relation to the supposed inspection at the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings, i.e. the share inventory list that Mr T\u00fcrkkan had allegedly sent him.\n\n155.3 The *teslim* that was alleged to have taken place in a garage in ikitelli was attested to only by Hakan Uzan, who was unable to recall any inventory or other document identifying the share certificates that were supposedly delivered.\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent further submitted that the documents produced by the Claimant contradicted the evidence of the occurrence of *teslim* given by its witnesses.\n\n156.1 Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin testified that the text of the STAs (in particular the range of dates indicated on the STAs representing the dates on which the individual transactions were supposed to have been executed) contradicted his evidence that *teslim* in relation to the share certificates in Istanbul only took place on one day in May 2003 (i.e. 15 May 2003).\n\n156.2 There was no language in the STAs stating that *teslim* took place, or even that it was to occur in the future.\n\n156.3 Libananco\u2019s board and management minutes failed to mention any of the three acts of *teslim* alleged by the Claimant.\n\n156.4 Libananco\u2019s Share Acquisition Report dated 20 May 2003 (Exhibit IT-61) did not mention any of the alleged deliveries or acts of *teslim,* and in any event also reflected acquisition dates earlier than April and May 2003.\n\n156.5 Libananco\u2019s audited 2002 and 2003 financial statements contradicted the evidence of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses that **teslim** took place in April and May 2003 since both statements showed that Libananco already owned millions of dollars\u2019 worth of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates on 31 December 2002 (well before the alleged occurrence of the first act of **teslim** in April 2003).\n\n**6. The Claimant failed to produce documents that would have existed if its story was true**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondent further submitted that the Claimant failed to produce documents that would exist if its version of events were true. The Respondent\u2019s case here was that, if the events alleged by the Claimant had in fact happened in 2002 and 2003, they would have generated a substantial paper trail, not only in Turkey, but also in Cyprus, Jordan, Switzerland, Lebanon and elsewhere. The Respondent submitted that the Claimant failed to produce any such record.\n\n158.\n\nThese documents would have included the following:\n\n(a) records of communications between Mr T\u00fcrkkan and Cem Uzan or Hakan Uzan regarding the supposed acquisition of Libananco in 2002;\n\n(b) documents relating to the operation of a company (i.e. Libananco) such as tax returns, bank account statements, registration of corporate formalities, records of routine administrative costs, and so on;\n\n(c) documents evidencing the alleged Uzan \"family divorce\" in January 2003, e.g. written advice from professional advisors when dividing up their business empire;\n\n(d) documents that would have been created in connection with (or otherwise evidencing) the alleged deliveries (i.e. legal transfers of possession) of share certificates to Libananco in April and May 2003; and\n\n(e) regulatory filings and approvals required by both Turkish and Cypriot law.\n\n**7. The Claimant\u2019s witnesses are not credible**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submitted that the testimony and conduct of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses showed that they were not credible and could not be relied upon. According to the Respondent, the credibility of the Claimant\u2019s case rests on its witnesses since the Claimant has not produced any paper trail or other independent corroboration of its case.\n\n***C. The factual witness evidence***\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. First Witness Statement of Cem Cengiz Uzan dated 20 September 2007**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nCem Uzan\u2019s First Witness Statement deals with the following areas of evidence:\n\n(a) the reasons that Cem Uzan\u2019s family decided to establish an international holding company (i.e. Libananco) in Cyprus;\n\n(b) the reasons Mr T\u00fcrkkan was chosen to begin the process of establishing this international holding company; and\n\n(c) the time frame in which Libananco allegedly acquired ownership of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates.\n\n*(a) Why Cem Uzan\u2019s family decided to establish Libananco in Cyprus*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nIn early 2002, Cem Uzan\u2019s Immediate Family decided to consider their future investment strategy with the aim of hedging against risks then prevalent in the Turkish economy. They had concerns that the business environment within Turkey could further deteriorate after the twin economic crises and thus negatively affect any new investments they might make domestically. They decided that they would *\"diversify\"* their business interests by making most of their future investments in business and operations outside of the country.\n\n162.\n\nThey decided to establish a new international holding company to facilitate their *\"diversification strategy\",* and *\"to capitalize the company with some of [their] most valuable and highest income-generating businesses. The latter was critical in order to facilitate the company\u2019s access to investment capital and debt and thereby support our international diversification plans\".*\n\n163.\n\nAround the same time (i.e. early 2002), Cem Uzan also made the decision to enter Turkish politics. For that reason, *\"protecting against politically-motivated actions against these business interests which might arise before or after the elections also became an important component of the business planning\".* At paragraph 21 of his First Witness Statement, Cem Uzan deposed that he entered Turkish politics *\"in the summer of2002\"* by assuming leadership of a party called the Gene Parti. He also deposed that the elections were scheduled for November that year.\n\n164.\n\nIn implementing this diversification plan, Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family were advised to set up a new company outside of Turkey and in a country within the European Union in order for them to benefit from: (i) political stability; (ii) a transparent legal and judicial system; (iii) ease of corporate administration; (iv) comprehensive rules on business confidentiality; and (v) favourable tax treatment. Cyprus was chosen because it was not politically recognised by Turkey and accordingly, the Uzans\u2019 *\"advisors believed that it would provide an extra layer of protection to these business interests that was not offered by any of the other jurisdictions that were under consideration\".*\n\n*(b) Why Mr T\u00fcrkkan was chosen to begin the process of establishing Libananco*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nCem Uzan deposed that he instructed Mr T\u00fcrkkan, whom he described as a *\"trusted business associate\"* to begin the process of sehing up a new company in Cyprus.\n\n166.\n\nHe deposed that he had instructed Mr T\u00fcrkkan to set up the new company in Cyprus firstly because he was a permanent resident of Amman, Jordan who had long served as an officer and employee in several of his businesses, especially those located outside of Turkey. Second, Mr T\u00fcrkkan was *\"a sophisticated, multi-lingual businessman\"*, who held a university degree in economics and was familiar with their businesses. Third, because he lived permanently in Jordan, he was able to travel easily to Cyprus to conduct the company\u2019s business and otherwise handle the business, legal and administrative affairs of the Cypriot company.\n\n167.\n\nThus, *\"after consultation with Turkish and Cypriot legal/accounting advisors, in 2002 Mr T\u00fcrkkan purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of a Cypriot company called Libananco\".*\n\n*(c) The time frame in which Libananco allegedly acquired ownership of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nCem Uzan deposed that:\n\n*\"When Libananco was purchased by Mr T\u00fcrkkan, it was a shell company without assets. To serve our business purposes, it needed a sufficient capital base for two primary reasons. First, such a base would enable it to access capital markets to facilitate its future investments. Second, a strongly capitalized company would be attractive to future business partners, and was usually a pre-requisite for participation in various asset and project tenders around the world.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*It was decided that in order to capitalize the company, Libananco would purchase my Immediate Family\u2019s shares in the Utilities\".*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The acquisition of shares in the Utilities made sense for Libananco as its very first investment. The Utilities had benefited from several years of major investment and growth and by 2002 were providing excellent returns. Accordingly, the acquisition of substantial ownership interests in those Utilities, it was felt, would establish Libananco\u2019s commercial credibility and facilitate its expansion into international markets...*\n\n\u2026\n\n*I was not involved in the administrative details of the acquisition of shares in the Utilities by Libananco, although I was generally kept informed of its progress.*  ***From approximately October 2002 until May 2003, Libananco acquired most of my Immediate Family\u2019s ownership interests in the Utilities***\n\n\u2026\n\n*At all times, Mr T\u00fcrkkan was the managing director and owner of Libananco as described in its public filings. At the same time, it was understood and agreed between Mr T\u00fcrkkan and me that he would own Libananco on our behalf... it would have been politically improvident under these circumstances to have disclosed my business relationship with Libananco on account of the sensitivities of the Turkey/Cyprus issue...*\n\n***By May 2003, nearly 18 months after the decision was made to establish an international investment company,***  *Libananco had completed its acquisition of a substantial number of shares in the Utilities from my Immediate Family,*  ***with more to be purchased. \"***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n**2. Second Witness Statement of Cem Cengiz Uzan dated 24 April 2009**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nCem Uzan\u2019s Second Witness Statement covers the following areas of evidence:\n\n(a) the circumstances surrounding the alleged \"family divorce\" that took place from the middle of 2002 to early 2003;\n\n(b) the significance of the STAs allegedly entered into between individual members of the Uzan family (except for Cem Uzan) and Libananco;\n\n(c) the physical process by which the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates were allegedly delivered to Libananco;\n\n(d) why Libananco did not attend the General Assemblies of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez held on 31 March 2003;\n\n(e) why he and members of his Immediate Family (and not Libananco) redeemed the dividends payable to shareholders of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez on 20 May 2003 (even though Libananco was alleged to have acquired their shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez by that time); and\n\n(f) why there was no public disclosure of the transfer of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Libananco even though, under Turkish law, Libananco would have been required to make various legal and regulatory filings if it had actually acquired majority interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in 2002 and 2003.\n\n*(a) The circumstances surrounding the alleged \"family divorce\"*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nCem Uzan began by explaining the manner in which the various businesses were organised within his family.\n\n170.1 He deposed that:\n\n*\"my father was responsible for running banking, cement and construction businesses, as well as heavy industries such as steel and aluminium manufacturing. On the other hand, my brother, Hakan, took responsibility for telecommunication operations (e.g. Telsim) and I was responsible for managing the media group (e.g. Star Media) and electricity enterprises (i.e. the Utilities). While there was some overlap here and there (such as... my father\u2019s advisory involvement in the Utilities), the primary responsibility for running these major businesses was divided between us fairly clearly\".*\n\n170.2 He elaborated as follows:\n\n*\"while for many years, I personally had primary control over the management and direction of the Utilities, as well as physical control of many of the bearer shares, as a practical matter my family collectively owned most of the shares in the Utilities until 2003*\n\n171.\n\nHe explained that part of the rationale for the alleged \"family divorce\" was as follows:\n\n*\"my efforts to lead the Gene Party in 2002 and 2003, including running a national campaign in 2002, essentially consumed my life. At the same time, my father was entirely focused on running his own businesses, and I frankly did not know much about them or what was happening in those companies, including Imar Bank (which my father managed with his brother, Yavuz Uzan). With Hakan being engaged with the various telecom matters and lawsuits, and my father consumed with his own affairs, it was becoming more and more difficult to continue our collective ownership of certain businesses. Moreover, it also interfered with my ability to focus on running those businesses that were my responsibility - namely, the Star Media Group and the Utilities. To be honest, I also viewed our failure to clearly divide our ownership interests as presenting a significant hindrance to my political career because of the potential for me to be associated publicly with companies I did not manage or control\".*\n\n172.\n\nHe explained that, by January 2003, his father, brother and he had decided to accomplish a full division in ownership of their various businesses:\n\n*\"along the lines of how we had managed them in the past. As part of this decision, it was thus agreed that my father, brother and sister would transfer to me their ownership interests in Star Media and the Utilities; that my father would be the sole owner of the family\u2019s remaining banking, manufacturing and construction companies; and my brother would be the sole owner of Telsim\".*\n\n173.\n\nCem Uzan deposed that the beneficial ownership of Libananco consequently changed in January 2003. At that time, the trust arrangement between Mr T\u00fcrkkan (who was at the time holding Libananco on trust for the benefit of Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family) and Cem Uzan\u2019s Immediate Family ended. As a result, from that point on, Cem Uzan remained the sole beneficial owner of Libananco, with Mr T\u00fcrkkan as his trustee.\n\n*(b) The significance of the STAs in the context of the alleged \"family divorce \"*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nAccording to Cem Uzan\u2019s Second Witness Statement:\n\n*\"[i]n October and November 2002, Hakan and Cenk T\u00fcrkkan (for Libananco) had used Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s draft to begin preparing share* *transfer agreements recording Hakan\u2019s intent to transfer his shares in the Utilities to Libananco\".*\n\n175.\n\nHowever, after preparing three such agreements (two for Kepez and one for \u00c7EA\u015e) *\"we did not take any more action on the matter\".* Cem Uzan deposed that *\"recording such a transfer did not seem to... be of any great importance\"* since his Immediate Family would still own Libananco beneficially. However, in January 2003, the STAs *\"took on a whole new importance\"*. Cem Uzan explained: *\"Therefore, at my request, my Immediate Family, along with Mr T\u00fcrkkan, once again commenced the process of executing various share transfer agreements in February 2003\".*\n\n176.\n\nRelations by that time between Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Cem Uzan had become increasingly strained and Cem Uzan *\"very much believed that it was important that [his] Immediate Family memorialize their intention to irrevocably surrender their ownership interests in the Utilities to Libananco, in order to prevent this from becoming an issue in any potential future disputes within the family\".*\n\n177.\n\nHe explained:\n\n*\"Since Libananco (a) was already in existence in Cyprus; (b) was owned by Mr T\u00fcrkkan in trust for my family and (c) was already in the process of acquiring our bearer shares in the Utilities, we decided that the severance of the Utilities\u2019 ownership to me alone could be best and most efficiently accomplished by (a) continuing to capitalize Libananco with the Utilities\u2019 bearer shares, as and for the reason previously agreed; but also (b) agreeing that Libananco would be held by Mr T\u00fcrkkan in trust for me alone... it made no sense to stop a process that was still relevant and already underway.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Thus at my instruction, my brother informed Mr T\u00fcrkkan that my Immediate Family would continue to transfer our bearer shares in the Utilities to Libananco but that thereafter, Mr T\u00fcrkkan would hold Libananco in trust for me alone. Mr T\u00fcrkkan agreed to this. Thus, from that time [i.e. April 2003, according to Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s First Witness Statement], Libananco was owned by me, through my trustee, Mr T\u00fcrkkan and would itself later acquire the bearer shares in the Utilities\".*\n\n178.\n\nCem Uzan also described the legal advice he had received in connection with the share transfer process:\n\n*\"... we were advised by our Turkish legal counsel that transfer of the bearer shares to Libananco - just like our prior ownership of the shares - did not have to be in writing at all. Rather, the share agreements were executed simply to memorialize my Immediate Family\u2019s intent to transfer shares in the Utilities to Libananco\".*\n\n179.\n\nCem Uzan explained that he did not personally sign any of the STAs as seller. He deposed that:\n\n*\"[a]s I was to be the sole owner of Libananco, there was no reason for me to demonstrate my intent to transfer my interest in the Utilities to a company which I beneficially owned. Moreover, as the General Manager of the company, it was naturally Mr Turkkan who signed each of the transfer agreements on behalf of Libananco\".*\n\n*(c) The process by which the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates were allegedly delivered to Libananco*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nCem Uzan deposed that *\"[t]hroughout the early months of2003, the majority of the physical bearer shares in the Utilities were being held in \"*the Rumeli and Dogus buildings and in his *\"family\u2019s holiday home in Switzerland.\"* He stated that:\n\n*\"Obviously, for Libananco to take possession of these shares and transport them to a secure location was going to be a major undertaking and one which I did not want to accomplish without serious safeguards being put into place\".*\n\n181.\n\nCem Uzan described the share delivery process as follows.\n\n*\"Therefore, with regard to the shares in Turkey, in April 2003, I instructed my brother to have the shares repackaged in the name of \"Libananco\". Then, on 15 May 2003 Libananco sent Mr. \u00c7i\u011fgin, who had been appointed as the company\u2019s legal representative, to go to the secure storage areas where the shares were being held in Istanbul, to inspect them on behalf of Libananco; and to ensure that they were being held for Libananco\u2019s benefit. After Mr. \u00c7i\u011fgin 's inspection, I arranged to have the largest denomination (i.e. most valuable) shares removed and taken to a secure location for Libananco. The remainder of the shares, all smaller denominations (and hence bulky) remained mostly in the Rumeli building pursuant to written share custody agreements between Libananco, and \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. The originals of these share custody agreements were delivered to my offices in ikitelli, Istanbul where I placed them in one of my safes. Those offices were subsequently raided on 14 February 2004 by the SDIF and all papers including those agreements, were seized.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*With regard to the shares in Switzerland, my brother Hakan, informed me in April 2003 that he had spoken to Mr Turkkan a few days earlier and had informed him that he was transferring those shares to Libananco.*  ***He also agreed with Mr Turkkan that those shares would continue to be kept by him in Switzerland, although now in custody for Libananco\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*(d) Why Libananco did not attend the General Assemblies of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez held on 31 March 2003*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nCem Uzan deposed that Libananco, *\"in view of how and when the ownership of the bearer shares was actually transferred... was not actually the legal owner of any shares in the Utilities on 31 March 2003, the date of the General Assemblies\".* It therefore did not attend the General Assemblies. He further deposed:\n\n*\"Although at that time my Immediate Family had undoubtedly undertaken to transfer their shares in the Utilities to Libananco, that company did not actually become the legal owner of any shares*  ***until April 2003***  *with regard to the bearer shares in Switzerland and*  ***May 2003***  *with regard to the bearer shares in istanbul\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*(e) Why Libananco did not redeem the dividends payable to shareholders of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez on 20 May 2003 even though it had allegedly acquired a majority of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez by that time*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nCem Uzan deposed that the share certificates and dividend coupons were separate bearer instruments and that:\n\n*\"most of the coupons for the Utilities\u2019 2002 dividends had already been removed from the share certificates being transferred to Libananco (i.e. those in the Rumeli and Dogus buildings in istanbul and those in our family home in Switzerland) by the time of the General Assemblies of 31 March 2003. In other words,*  ***when Libananco took ownership of the share certificates in April and May 2003 respectively, it did not take ownership of virtually any of the coupons for the Utilities\u2019 2002 dividends. This remained with me and my family and we therefore redeemed the dividends on 20 May 2003\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*(f)*  *Why there was no public disclosure of Libananco\u2019s alleged acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez even though this was required under Turkish law*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nCem Uzan deposed that: *\"It is true that there was no public disclosure of the transfer of the Utilities\u2019 bearer shares to Libananco to Turkish or Cypriot authorities until 2005\".* This significant transaction was *\"undertaken confidentially\"* and:\n\n*\"Although it was generally and publicly known we held a large interest in the two companies, it was not disclosed to the Turkish regulatory authorities how we allocated ownership of the bearer shares among* *ourselves (and among other entities we owned or controlled) at any given time*\n\n185.\n\nCem Uzan stated that the confidentiality *\"continued before during and after the 2002-2003 process of transferring ownership of bearer shares in the two Utilities to Libananco\"* and *\"[at] the same time, [he] obtained legal advice from his Turkish counsel, Mr. Saylan (\u00c7i\u011fgin, to ensure that not making these disclosures did not negatively impact the legitimacy of the share transfers\".*\n\n186.\n\nCem Uzan believed at that time *\"that public disclosures of the transfer to a Cypriot company... might attract negative political attention\".*\n\n187.\n\nAs a result:\n\n*\"Until 2005, Libananco, through Mr Turkkan, also maintained this same confidentiality. Indeed, public disclosure even of Mr Ttirkkan\u2019s ownership of Libananco would have revealed, at the very least, a connection between Libananco and my [i.e. Cem Uzan\u2019s] family\".*\n\n**3. Cross-examination of Cem Uzan**\n------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nCem Uzan was cross-examined on the following mahers:\n\n(a) the time frame in which Libananco allegedly acquired ownership of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates; and\n\n(b) why he did not file financial disclosures in respect of material changes in his assets which were mandatory under Turkish law for leaders of political parties, even though he allegedly transferred significant interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Aysegul Uzan and Hakan Uzan respectively pursuant to the \"family divorce\" (see paragraph 138.3 above).\n\n*(a) The time frame in which Libananco allegedly acquired ownership of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nOn this topic, Cem Uzan gave the following evidence.\n\n189.1 In his First Witness Statement, he deposed that Libananco acquired ownership interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez from October 2002 until May 2003. It was put to Cem Uzan that his evidence (as appears from paragraph 33 of his Second Witness Statement) was to the contrary, i.e. that no acquisitions took place until April and May 2003, when *teslim* in relation to the share certificates in Switzerland and Istanbul respectively were alleged to have been accomplished.\n\n189.2 He admitted that until *teslim* takes place, it is the seller of the share certificates that owns the latter (Tr 2780:21-2781:1) - in his own words, *\"the acquisition is not complete until you have teslim\"* (Tr 2784:11-2784:12).\n\n189.3 He agreed that *teslim* (with regard to the share certificates in istanbul) only took place on 15 May 2003. When pressed as to whether Libananco could have acquired those share certificates (i.e. the share certificates that were allegedly delivered on 15 May 2003 in istanbul) before 15 May 2003, Cem Uzan was evasive and did not give a direct or helpful answer. He likened the acquisition to:\n\n*\"an ongoing process... It is like buying a car. You go into a car dealership. You sign a contract... But until you have taken over the car, you \u2019re in the car and drive away, you haven\u2019t bought the car. You have a contract to buy the car, and the same thing with bearer shares, okay? Until teslim takes place, the acquisition is not completed\"* (Tr 2780:6-2780:19).\n\n189.4 Although there are apparent inconsistencies in the evidence summarised above, the Tribunal considers that the totality of Cem Uzan\u2019s evidence here appears to be that Libananco only acquired ownership of the bearer share certificates in Switzerland and istanbul in April 2003 and on 15 May 2003 respectively.\n\n*(b) Cem Uzan\u2019s failure to file financial disclosures required under Turkish law for a leader of a political party*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nCem Uzan was also cross-examined on the requirements under Turkish law for him (as a leader of a political party) to file mandatory financial disclosures in respect of material changes in his assets. The underlying premise of this line of cross-examination was that if the alleged transfers of his shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan and Hakan Uzan respectively (pursuant to the alleged \"family divorce\") in fact occurred, this would have required disclosure. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that this portion of the cross-examination impacts upon the credibility of the \"family divorce\" theory which is now central to the Claimant\u2019s case.\n\n190.1 Cem Uzan was referred to his Financial Disclosure of 17 April 2003 (Exhibit H-169), and was asked why there was no reference to his alleged divestment of his shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez pursuant to the alleged \"family divorce\". His response was: *\"because the teslim had not taken place\"* (Tr 2813:21-2813:22). It is noteworthy that he did not elaborate as to when *teslim* in relation to the alleged intra-family transfers did occur.\n\n190.2 Cem Uzan was referred to his Financial Disclosure of 12 June 2003 (Exhibit H-186), where it was disclosed that Kepez and \u00c7EA\u015e had paid its shareholder (i.e. Cem Uzan himself) the dividends set out. Annexed to Cem Uzan\u2019s Financial Disclosure of 12 June 2003 were two letters from \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez (both dated 29 May 2003) stating that dividends had been paid to Cem Uzan. The letter from Kepez was specifically addressed: *\"To our Company\u2019s Shareholder Mr Cem Cengiz Uzan\".* Cem Uzan was asked whether he declared, in his Financial Disclosure of 12 June 2003, that he received the dividends as a shareholder of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez respectively. His reply was that the dividends were paid to him *\"as the coupon holder of the dividends. Dividends are paid to coupons, sir\"* (Tr 2816:18-2816:19).\n\n190.3 When probed further as to why there was no disclosure (pursuant to the alleged \"family divorce\") of his alleged divestment of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez, Cem Uzan did not give a relevant answer (Tr 2817:8-2817:14).\n\n190.4 Cem Uzan admitted that it would warrant disclosure under Turkish law if he had disposed of his shareholding (Tr 2820:2-2820:5). He then explained: *\"What the lawyers and accountants advised me I filed [sic] up\"* (Tr 2820:10-2820:11).\n\n190.5 He was referred to his Financial Disclosure of 31 July 2003 (Exhibit H-201), and was asked why there was no disclosure of his alleged 100 per cent beneficial ownership of Libananco, which had by that time allegedly acquired substantial interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. Cem Uzan was unable to give any explanation other than that: *\"you have to ask Mrs. Rakrimra (ph.), I guess, that, because she was one of the lawyers who advised me on that filing\"* (Tr 2808:5-2808:7).\n\n**4. Witness Statement of Murat Hakan Uzan dated 9 October 2009**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nHakan Uzan\u2019s Witness Statement takes the form of questions and answers (i.e. not in the form of a conventional witness deposition), with him giving his answers to questions posed to him by the Claimant\u2019s Counsel. Hakan Uzan\u2019s Witness Statement covered the following areas:\n\n(a) the sehing up of Libananco and its acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez;\n\n(b) the circumstances surrounding the alleged \"family divorce\" - in particular, how he came to acquire a large quantity of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates as a result of a number of intra-family transfers;\n\n(c) why no cash actually changed hands even though the STAs entered into between him and other individual members of his family on the one hand and Libananco on the other hand indicate that *\"cash\"* was given as consideration for the share certificates;\n\n(d) the ownership structure in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez amongst his family members; and\n\n(e) how delivery (to Libananco) or *teslim* took place with respect to the share certificates located in Switzerland;\n\n*(a) The setting up of Libananco and its acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nHakan Uzan deposed that, at the beginning of 2002, he and his brother Cem Uzan decided that their family should acquire an international investment company outside of Turkey. They decided that the company would be owned by someone other than themselves, for and on behalf of Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan, his father Kemal Uzan and his sister Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan.\n\n193.\n\nHe deposed that: *\"Given my brother\u2019s [i.e. Cem Uzan\u2019s] decision in early 2002 to devote his time to a campaign for public office, it fell to me to oversee purchase of the foreign investment company\".*\n\n194.\n\nIn or around March 2002, he asked Mr T\u00fcrkkan, *\"a trusted senior executive in Jordan who had worked for [him] personally for around five years\",* to research various jurisdictions around the world where such a company could either easily be founded or purchased.\n\n195.\n\nA few days later, Mr T\u00fcrkkan emailed him a Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (\"SWOT\") analysis of various jurisdictions, recommending the Cyprus as the most suitable choice.\n\n196.\n\nHakan Uzan deposed that he settled on Cyprus, which had the added benefit of being a location where the Turkish Government would be cautious to tread. Given Cem Uzan\u2019s political aspirations, all of *\"us\"* (i.e. the Uzan family) had begun to think of potential retaliation from the Turkish Government as a factor to be taken into account in business planning.\n\n197.\n\nAccording to Hakan Uzan, after *\"we\"* had reached *\"our\"* decision (i.e. the Uzan brothers or the Uzan family), Hakan Uzan told Mr T\u00fcrkkan that he should proceed to establish or purchase a company in Cyprus in his name to be held on behalf of Kemal Uzan, Cem Uzan, Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan and himself.\n\n198.\n\nIn April 2002, Mr T\u00fcrkkan informed him that he had purchased a Cypriot company by the name of Libananco and Hakan Uzan *\"told him to await further instructions\".*\n\n199.\n\nIn the early fall of 2002, Hakan Uzan called Mr T\u00fcrkkan again and informed him that Libananco was to acquire a majority of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. Hakan Uzan deposed as follows:\n\n*\"I did not tell him [i.e. Mr T\u00fcrkkan] the purpose of this transaction; only that it was a family decision and that he would receive (i) a template share transfer agreement that he could employ for recording the transaction, and (ii) information from Shareholder Services Department in istanbul, which would provide him with the information he would require for inputting information into the template\".*\n\n200.\n\nHakan Uzan deposed that, from late October 2002 to early June 2003, Kemal Uzan, Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan and Hakan Uzan executed a total of 32 STAs (with Libananco as the counterparty). By agreement among family members, the STAs transferred 100 per cent of Hakan Uzan\u2019s shares, 100 per cent of Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan\u2019s shares and the majority of Kemal Uzan\u2019s shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Libananco.\n\n201.\n\nIt was Hakan Uzan who decided what quantity of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares would be transferred to Libananco at any particular time and by whom, in order to ultimately reach a particular threshold (approximately 67 per cent) ownership by Libananco, which had specific significance in relation to the control of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.5\n\ncf. Exhibit C-155, Libananco Minutes of Directors Meeting dated 15 November 2002: ***\"It is agreed to continue to purchase shares until a threshold of 45% in both companies\".***\n\n202.\n\nHe provided the information to a trusted employee of his *(\"probably Sadrettin Balaban*\"), who would convert the percentages into numbers and forward that information to Mr Turkkan. The Shareholder Services Department at \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez would closely monitor and track each transaction for their records.\n\n203.\n\nThere was no particular legal or business reason why he requested the transfers to be done in tranches over a period of time; this was simply a business practice that the Uzan companies routinely followed for decades in Turkey.\n\n204.\n\nHe also confirmed that he would receive two versions of the STAs (one signed by Mr Turkkan and one unsigned) which would arrive on his desk *\"via the Legal Department\".*\n\n205.\n\nHe would sign them or arrange for the relevant seller to sign them. He confirmed that he personally signed each of the STAs on which his signature appears, and provided the exact pen used for those signatures to the Claimant\u2019s Counsel.\n\n206.\n\nHe confirmed that Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan signed each of the STAs on which her signature appears in his presence.\n\n207.\n\nIn relation to his father Kemal Uzan, he deposed that:\n\n*\"although my father did not usually sign his Agreements [i. e. the STAs] in my presence, and many of his business documents and letters had been signed by his two brothers (my two uncles) on his behalf for a number of years, I can confirm that (i) he told me, at that time, that he had personally signed the Agreements, (ii) at that time, I recognized his signature, and (iii) I still do so now upon being shown again the Agreements in question*\n\n208.\n\nHe stated that *\"it is virtually certain that I provided many of the Agreements for signature in a group or stack after I had collected a sufficient number for it to be worth my time to seek a signature or execute my own\".*\n\n*(b) The circumstances surrounding the alleged \"family divorce\" and how Hakan Uzan came to acquire a large quantity of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nHakan Uzan elaborated on the alleged \"family divorce\" as follows:\n\n*\"As background, I would note that (i) my brother Cem became the sole beneficial owner of Libananco on account of this split (ii) we relinquished certain shares in various companies to each other to concretize - or more accurately, begin to concretize - the split (e.g. my brother\u2019s shares in Telsim to me or my shares in my father\u2019s various industrial companies to him, etc); (iii)*  ***as part of the consideration for my father relinquishing his interest in companies to be owned by my brother and me, my father received the largest Utilities\u2019 dividends in 2003\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n210.\n\nHe deposed that the \"family divorce\" occurred *\"between October 2002 (when [his] family commenced the process of transferring some of the shares [they] did then own personally) to May and June 2003 (when [he] transferred the remaining shares [he] had come to own in the interim to Libananco)\".* However, he said during direct examination that the \"family divorce\" took place in *\"March, April, May 2003\"* (Tr 1842:3-1842:4) instead.\n\n211.\n\nHe deposed that the 16 intra-family agreements (recovered as deleted electronic files on Mr Turkkan's floppy disks) reflected a *quid pro quo* as between family members for the respective transfers. He subsequently agreed during direct examination that these intra-family agreements were signed *\"in approximately early April, April 3 or 4, 2003\"* (Tr 1845:18-1845:20).\n\n212.\n\nHe was asked by the Claimant\u2019s Counsel in direct examination to elaborate on these agreements. He said that they were signed in circumstances where:\n\n*\"the General Assembly [of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez that was held in 2003] had taken place [on] the 31st of March, and it was an ongoing discussion before and after between my father, my brother, and I, and my brother was pushing me to get these signed. I had asked to pass by my father\u2019s house where he worked several times, and I passed by his office there. I visited him. I discussed the things again, and he signed them in front of me there\"* (Tr 1848:7-1848:15).\n\nHe confirmed that he saw Kemal Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan sign these agreements (Tr 1848:16-1849:1).\n\n213.\n\nAt the time *\"Shareholder Services\"* undertook their calculations for Hakan Uzan in 2002 and 2003, he *\"was not the majority shareholder in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez\".* This was qualified by his evidence that:\n\n*\"By May 2003, however, I was [the majority shareholder in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez], thus explaining how I ended up as a seller of the largest* *amount of Utilities\u2019 shares to Libananco. The reason for this \"intermediate\" movement of shares between October 2002 (when my family commenced the process of transferring some of the shares we did then own personally) to*  ***May and June 2003***  *(when I transferred the remaining shares he had come to own in the interim to Libananco), lies in the decision made around that time by my brother, father and myself to go our separate ways in business\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n214.\n\nHe stated:\n\n*\"There would always be claims and counterclaims in what is inevitably a messy process. But that is precisely the reason my brother insisted on my family documenting our intent in the share transfer agreements: while there might be room for bickering, there would ultimately be no doubt about the actual ownership\".*\n\n*(c) Why no \"cash\" changed hands as a result of the STAs entered into with Libananco*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nHe also confirmed that no cash changed hands as a result of the individual STAs entered into between him and other members of his family on the one hand and Libananco on the other hand. He deposed:\n\n*\"The reason why there is \"cash\" shown as paid on the face of the Agreements when, in fact, no \"cash\" changed hands is because this was a template agreement used by the Uzan Companies for*  *all* *its intra-group transactions... Even though there was no \"cash\" changing hands per se, there was no reason not to use this same template again because Libananco was in fact taking a debt on its books*  *equivalent to*  *the cash considered paid and received by each of the three sellers. Had Turkey not cancelled \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s concession agreements in June 2003, our Legal and Tax Departments would have worked with Mr. Turkkan and Libananco\u2019s Board to ensure that Libananco\u2019s debt would eventually have been repaid in the most tax-efficient manner through the income it would have received from \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in future years and any further investment it planned to make\".*\n\n(underlined portions emphasised as italics in original text)\n\n*(d) The arrangement as to ownership of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez within the Uzan family and the relationship between dividends and shareholding*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nIn relation to the issue of why the dividends paid out by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in 2003 were not collected by Libananco, but rather by members of the Uzan family, Hakan Uzan deposed that the:\n\n*\"actual ownership [of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez] is*  *in no way* *related to who claimed dividends in 2003. The dividend collection was agreed* *by and between my brother, father and I as part of the initial stages of concretizing our asset and business separation (what my brother has referred to as a \"family divorce,\"...).*  ***Ownership and dividend collections are, therefore, completely distinct\".***\n\n(emphasis added, underlined text italicised in original text)\n\n217.\n\nHakan Uzan further deposed that:\n\n*\"Actual ownership in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez amongst my family was, in fact, very complicated... which Uzan family member owned (directly or through another company) the entity which owned the Utilities\u2019 shares also changed over time, again for tax or other reasons. In other words, individual ownership in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez between my father, brother, sister and I (and other family-owned companies) fluctuated over time. We knew, of course, that as a family, we owned the majority of the shares. We also used a certain percentage of the shares to hold General Assemblies of the Utilities.*  ***But none of that required an accurate tally of each individual owner\u2019s share percentage, whether direct or indirect.***  *The only way such an individual tally could have been calculated would have been as I described above: to first receive accurate shareholder information from the Shareholders Services at \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez and then to take that information to the Shareholders Services Departments at other Uzan companies to see which entity was held by which other entity and eventually up the chain, which individual family member held how many shares\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n218.\n\nHe deposed that Exhibit R-821, allegedly an e-mail message from his secretary *\"attaching a fax with [his] entire family\u2019s holdings in each and every company\"* was not legitimate. He deposed:\n\n*\"I can state without hesitation that this document cannot be legitimate for various reasons. First, my secretary sat across from me. There is simply no reason for her to be emailing me a fax rather than just giving it to me. Second, she has not written anything in the text of the email. Again, this was not standard practice for my secretary... Third there is no fax header to the document... Finally... the actual information contained in the attachment (i) was very difficult to obtain, requiring access to shareholder service departments of all the various companies and all levels across Turkey, requiring the permission of each family member listed in the document (ii) was information that we purposely kept highly confidential... (iii) would never have been collated by anyone in a single document that would have been faxed or scanned or emailed loosely around the group and (iv) contains information that I know is false. Specifically, the amounts of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares listed as being \"owned\" by my family appear to correlate to the dividend pay out in 2003. As I stated, this was never indicative of ownership.*  ***Rather, ownership was evolving between*** ***2002 and 2003... and culminated in the transfer of the majority of the Utilities\u2019 bearer shares to Libananco in 2003. The fact that R-821 attempts to match ownership to dividend payment, when they are unrelated, tells me one thing: this is a fraudulently manufactured document\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*(e) Delivery to Libananco or teslim in respect of the share certificates located in Switzerland*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nHe also deposed that he sold the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates which were located and Switzerland and owned by him. This transaction was recorded on paper (i.e. in the STAs). He deposed that:\n\n*\"Adding up the number of shares transferred to Libananco as recorded in the Agreements [i. e. the STAs], and comparing that number to the number of shares I understand are currently in Vienna, Austria and those that were seized in Turkey, it is clear that I did sell all my shares, including those in Switzerland. Otherwise, the numbers would not make sense\".*\n\n220.\n\nIn respect of the sale of the share certificates in Switzerland, he deposed that:\n\n*\"What is not recorded is the actual delivery of shares to Libananco, which was undertaken by a phone call I made to Mr. T\u00fcrkkan in April 2002, in which I informed him that I was holding bearer shares in Switzerland, which I had transferred (or was going to transfer) in the Agreements [i. e. the STAs], on behalf of Libananco\".*\n\n**5. Cross-Examination of Hakan Uzan**\n--------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe cross-examination of Hakan Uzan covered the following areas:\n\n(a) his involvement in the formation of Libananco and the circumstances surrounding how he came to choose Mr Turkkan to set up Libananco and manage its affairs;\n\n(b) the terms (and other details) of the alleged trust arrangement pursuant to which Mr Turkkan allegedly held his shares in Libananco on trust for the benefit of members of the Uzan family;\n\n(c) why *\"cash\"* was declared on the face of the STAs (suggesting that cash was paid to the seller of the shares as consideration for the transfer to Libananco), even though no cash in fact changed hands as a result of the execution of the STAs;\n\n(d) the circumstances surrounding the alleged \"family divorce\", in particular the subsequent events and the intra-family transactions;\n\n(e) the alleged third act of *teslim* in relation to share certificates located in istanbul, which had not been mentioned anywhere previously; and\n\n(f) the particulars surrounding the *teslim* that allegedly took place in relation to the share certificates which were kept in Switzerland.\n\n*(a) Hakan Uzan\u2019s involvement in the formation of Libananco and his choice of Mr Turkkan to manage Libananco\u2019s affairs*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nHakan Uzan began by confirming that he *\"played a central role in matters relating to the formation of Libananco and the acquisition by Libananco of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez\"* (Tr 1860:9-1860:15).\n\n223.\n\nHis evidence was that he had a prior working relationship with Mr T\u00fcrkkan, and that, as between him and his brother Cem Uzan, he was the one who had dealings with Mr T\u00fcrkkan (Tr 2048:19-2049:9).\n\n223.1 He confirmed that he asked Mr T\u00fcrkkan to set up Libananco and to hold it on trust - initially for all members of his immediate family (including him), and then later only for Cem Uzan (presumably once the alleged \"family divorce\" had taken place) (Tr 2049:10-2049:18).\n\n223.2 In relation to this alleged trust arrangement, his evidence is that Cem Uzan had complete trust in Mr T\u00fcrkkan (as his trustee), even though nothing was recorded in writing in relation to the trust arrangement (Tr 2050:20-2051:4).\n\n224.\n\nIn relation to Mr T\u00fcrkkan himself, Hakan Uzan gave the following evidence.\n\n224.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was the *\"Turkish representative in the Jordanian [Uzan] companies\"* (Tr 1989:18-1989:19) - *\"there was JPP, Alpha, there were a couple of other ones, but I wouldn \u2019t know if he was registered as an employee in all of them\"* (Tr 1990:3-1990:5).\n\n224.2 Hakan Uzan said that, within those companies, Mr T\u00fcrkkan *\"was responsible for finance and financial matters, shareholder matters and such for companies that operated in Jordan and were established in Jordan\"* (Tr 1990:8-1990:11).\n\n224.3 Hakan Uzan was referred to Exhibit H-152, which contained an e-mail message from one Haciahmet Bas (who appeared to be Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s supervisor at Rumeli Telekom) to him. In that e-mail message, Mr Bas was very critical of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s abilities and proposed that Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s salary be reduced if Hakan Uzan wished to keep him as an employee. Hakan Uzan agreed that Mr Bas had a critical view of Mr T\u00fcrkkan (Tr 1993:16-1993:18).\n\n224.4 Hakan Uzan also confirmed that he *\"[m]ost possibly\"* decided to cut Mr Turkkan's salary by half at the time the e-mail messages in Exhibit H-152 were sent (i.e. February 2003) (Tr 1996:6-1996:9).\n\n224.5 When asked why Mr Turkkan was nevertheless still chosen to conduct a SWOT analysis, Hakan Uzan replied as follows:\n\n*\"First, Cenk [i.e. Mr T\u00fcrkkan] was not the only person whose salary was cut in half. Over the 2000 year period, at least hundreds of people in Istanbul and in other countries as well as all the other employees in Jordan had their salaries cut because it was a serious economic crisis and the companies were facing challenges, so it wasn\u2019t unique to Cenk.*  ***I had met Cenk on many occasions, and I knew him personally, and I knew his preparation of reports, and his diligence to the work I assigned to him. That was sufficient for me to decide on him\"***  *(Tr 1998:17-1999:5).*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*(b) The terms of the alleged trust arrangement between Mr Turkkan and members of the Uzan family in relation to Libananco*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nAs to the terms of this unwritten trust arrangement, Hakan Uzan testified that Mr Turkkan: *\"holds it for us, and whenever I or we tell him to transfer it to whoever we designate, he transfers it\"* (Tr 2042:8-2042:10).\n\n225.1 When asked who the beneficiaries of the trust were, Hakan Uzan answered that, when Libananco was first acquired: *\"My understanding would be me and my brother\"* (Tr 2042:16-2042:17). He then elaborated that there was:\n\n*\"always this question in my mind, you know, my sister was there, my father was there, but I was trying\u2014at one point, everything I established I would start making just me and my brother, but I think at this stage I would say that at that time it was still probably for everybody\"* (Tr 2042:19-2043:2).\n\n225.2 When asked to clarify whether Libananco was initially being held on trust for just Hakan Uzan and his brother Cem Uzan, or all four members of Cem Uzan\u2019s Immediate Family, Hakan was unable to give a clear answer:\n\n*\"As I said, there was always discussion of divorce, always. And at the time when this [i.e. Libananco] was being bought, and generally with all the other companies, it was always this question, are we together, are we not, shall I start with the things that I\u2019m doing now being separate, being divorced or not? So, I may have told him like that,*  ***but it\u2019s difficult for me to know because always there was the issue of divorce*** (Tr 2046:7-2046:15).\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n225.3 He was then asked how Mr T\u00fcrkkan could be sure who the beneficiaries were, if even he was not certain at the time. His response was that: *\"He [i.e. Mr Turkkan] doesn\u2019t need to know that... He\u2019s holding it under my instructions\"* (Tr 2043:5-2043:7). When probed further, he agreed with Counsel for the Respondent that: *\"He\u2019s [i.e. Mr Turkkan] holding it on your instructions for members of your family, but he doesn\u2019t know which members\".* Accordingly: *\"He [i.e. Mr Turkkan] would need to ask me or get instructions from me in that regard\"* (Tr 2043:9-2043:16). He elaborated that: *\"the terms were that when I told him, he would do what I tell him\"* (Tr 2054:2-2054:3). Specifically, Hakan Uzan agreed that *\"the terms of the unwritten trusts [were] never, in fact, expressly communicated to [Mr T\u00fcrkkan]\"* (Tr 2054:13-2054:17).\n\n225.4 Hakan Uzan was asked whether Mr T\u00fcrkkan was, for a period of three months, *\"proceeding under a completely false apprehension as to who [was] actually interested in Libananco\",* since the change in the arrangement pertaining to the holding of Libananco occurred between Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan in January 2003, but that information was not communicated to Mr T\u00fcrkkan until April 2003 (Tr 2055:6-2055:15). Hakan Uzan responded as follows: *\"I guess maybe that wasn \u2019t a top priority in those months, so it took me a little longer, yes\"* (Tr 2055:16-2055:18). Interestingly, Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence was that, even after April 2003 (when Mr T\u00fcrkkan was informed by Hakan Uzan that Cem Uzan would henceforth be the sole beneficial owner of Libananco), he continued to communicate with Mr T\u00fcrkkan in relation to *\"the day-to-day daily work and day-to-day management and operation of the companies, including the liaise [sic] with Mr. T\u00fcrkkan\"* (Tr 2056:11-2056:21). Hakan Uzan\u2019s explanation for this was that his brother Cem Uzan *\"was in politics\"* (Tr 2056:16).\n\n225.5 Hakan Uzan was asked how he communicated the change in beneficial ownership of Libananco to Mr T\u00fcrkkan. His response was this was done *\"[b]y telephone\",* but that he had no record of that telephone call:\n\n*\"I never kept separate notes of or, like you said, remarks of making phone calls to anybody, any executive or outside party, and unless it was required, I never did a follow-up e-mail. But I\u2019m sure the telephone company should have all the records of all the telephone calls\"* (Tr 2051:14-2052:7).\n\n225.6 The Respondent\u2019s Counsel put to Hakan Uzan the scenario where Mr T\u00fcrkkan met with an unfortunate accident, and asked whether there would be any proof to show that Libananco was not owned by Mr T\u00fcrkkan for himself, but rather it was being held for members of the Uzan family, and later Cem Uzan himself (Tr 2208:9-2208-14). Hakan Uzan first replied that *\"that was the case for a multitude of shareholdings that were placed on other people in Turkish companies, or outside of Turkey\"* (Tr 2208:15-2208:17), but later agreed that it was *\"[t]rue\"* that here was absolutely nothing that he or Cem Uzan could do to establish that, in fact, the shares in Libananco were not owned by Mr Turkkan beneficially for himself (Tr 2209:10-2209:16).\n\n*(c) Why \"cash\" was declared on the face of the STAs even though no cash in fact changed hands as a result of the execution of the STAs*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nHakan Uzan was referred to paragraph 17 of his Witness Statement where he deposed that *\"cash\"* was declared on the face of the STAs even though no cash changed hands, and that these were meant to represent a book debt in favour of the sellers which would eventually have been repaid if the Concession Agreements held by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez had not been cancelled in June 2003.\n\n226.1 He confirmed in cross-examination that *\"the Share Transfer Agreements, on their face, purport to show money being paid\"* (Tr 2083:12-2083:15).\n\n226.2 He also confirmed that no money was in fact paid to the sellers pursuant to the STAs (Tr 2083:21-2084:1), but that Libananco\u2019s debt (i.e. what is referred to as *\"cash\"* on the STAs) would have been repaid to the sellers of the shares if the Concession Agreements had not been cancelled (Tr 2085:13-2085:20).\n\n226.3 When confronted by the Respondent\u2019s Counsel that: *\"in fact, there was no arrangement at all, as far as you were concerned, in place for any future payment, although you say there must have been some\",* Hakan Uzan initially did not offer any helpful clarification other than to say that: *\"the payments as such were part of the divorce. And, for example, my* *father got the largest dividends out of the divorce; that was part of the compensation\"* (Tr 2088:7-2088:14).\n\n226.4 But when asked whether there was an agreement as to how his father Kemal Uzan would be paid by Libananco, he said that: *\"My father would not get paid directly through Libananco. It was part of the family divorce how everything was split up\"* (Tr 2086:22-2087:2). When asked to confirm whether, in his father\u2019s case, it was indeed the case that no money was ever going to be paid as set out in the STAs, he explained: *\"that\u2019s why he received a very large portion of the dividends\"* (Tr 2087:8-2087:9).\n\n226.5 Hakan Uzan explained that the large dividend received by his father Kemal Uzan was given to him as consideration for, among other things, his father\u2019s transfer of his shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. He was asked by the Respondent\u2019s Counsel:\n\n*\"So, as I understand it, in particular your father, he supposedly got an especially large dividend in 2003, and his, as it were, consideration for transferring shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez was the especially large dividend and the fact that he was getting other parts of the Uzan empire, the bank and the industrial holdings; correct?\",*\n\nto which his response was: *\"Yes, more or less yes\".*\n\n226.6 On this basis, he confirmed that, after his father Kemal Uzan received the large dividend, there would be no further monies due to him from Libananco for the supposed sale of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares (Tr 2212:3-2212:6).\n\n226.7 Hakan Uzan was also questioned as to why the 2003 financial statements of Libananco recorded a debt of US$ 234 million that was owed to Mr Turkkan, notwithstanding the fact that Libananco allegedly acquired a book debt in favour of the sellers of the shares. He said that he was unable to explain why this was the case, and said that: *\"I have never seen the Libananco balance sheets. I never had the opportunity to go through them or structure them in any way\"* (Tr 2213:18-2213:20). He even went so far as to say that that *\"would be incorrect. It would need to be corrected\"* (Tr 2214:10-2214:11).\n\n*(d) The circumstances surrounding the alleged \"family divorce\" and the series of intra-family transactions which purportedly took place pursuant to the \"family divorce \"*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nIn relation to the alleged \"family divorce\", Hakan Uzan gave the following evidence.\n\n227.1 When asked whether he had effected a reconciliation with his father Kemal Uzan, he said that: *\"To have a reconciliation, you must have a falling out first\"* (Tr 2214:20-2214:21). When asked whether he in fact had a falling out with his father, Hakan Uzan said: *\"No. I mean as always, I mean, over the years we always had our disagreements, but\u2014so, no, I didn\u2019t have a fallout with him\"* (Tr 2215:2-2215:4).\n\n227.2 Hakan Uzan was asked whether it was Kemal Uzan who ran \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez, even after the alleged \"family divorce\" where it was agreed that there would be a *\"full division\"6* of ownership of the various businesses, with ownership of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez going to Cem Uzan. His initial response was that this was not so: *\"I would say for major issues my brother [i.e. Cem Uzan] was responsible\"* (Tr 2109:11-2109:12). However, he later said that his father Kemal Uzan was in charge of \u00c7EA\u015e *\"[o]n certain daily issues\"* (Tr 2111:15). Significantly, he admitted that his father Kemal Uzan was in charge of dealing with the important issue of the cancellation of the Concession Agreements then held by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez (Tr 2111:20-2112:2).\n\n227.3 Hakan Uzan was referred to Exhibit H-418, which was an excerpt from the istanbul Trade Registry Gazette, No 5824, 20 June 2003. This shows that Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family incorporated a new company even after the alleged \"family divorce\". It was put to Hakan Uzan that this was not consistent with a \"family divorce\" having taken place earlier. His response was that:\n\n*\"a divorce, especially family divorce, with\u2014of this magnitude nor of this size never happens in one day. We were pushing for the divorce, and the first steps which was the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez separation and the Telsim separation had started. Obviously, it hadn\u2019t gone through all the companies and/or all the systems\"* (Tr 2136:5-2136:11).\n\nHe went on to say that: *\"It [i. e. the alleged \"family divorce\"] began in 2003. We are actually never able to completely make a divorce. Now if we would have been able to, a lot of other things would not have happened\"* (Tr 2137:10-2137:13).\n\n227.4 Hakan Uzan was asked whether it was indeed the case that the alleged \"family divorce\" happened without the involvement of external lawyers, bankers or accountants. He confirmed that this was true and that there was no documentary evidence other than the intra-family agreements (deleted files recovered from Mr Turkkan's floppy disks) and the 32 STAs:\n\n*\"Yes. There would be no way that my father, me, or my brother would bring in a third party, may be whatever the position, into our negotiations and into our discussions of what was going to happen garage [sic] and how the divorce was going to happen. It was just not the way it was going to be\"* (Tr 2138:19-2139:15).\n\nCem Uzan\u2019s Second Witness Statement, paragraph 17.\n\n228.\n\nIn relation to the intra-family transactions carried out pursuant to the alleged \"family divorce\", Hakan Uzan gave the following evidence.\n\n228.1 Hakan Uzan was asked how, notwithstanding that the record of dividends showed that he received payouts corresponding to 0.43 per cent of the total shareholding of Kepez, he transferred shares corresponding to a total of 44.08 per cent of the shareholding of Kepez. He disagreed that his total shareholding in Kepez amounted to 0.43 per cent, saying: *\"No. It only means that within the family distribution of dividends, I only received that percentage from the dividends\"* (Tr 2099:1-2099:3).\n\n228.2 Hakan Uzan was also asked, in relation to \u00c7EA\u015e, how he managed to transfer shares amounting to 35.53 per cent of the shareholding in \u00c7EA\u015e to Libananco, even though, according to the record of dividends paid out, he only received dividends corresponding to 6.04 per cent of the shareholding of \u00c7EA\u015e. The Respondent\u2019s Counsel put to him that the total shareholding in \u00c7EA\u015e allegedly transferred to him via the intra-family transfers was 29.04 per cent, and that when this figure was added to the earlier figure of 6.04 per cent, this gave a total of approximately 35 per cent which he alleged he transferred to Libananco. It was put to him that:\n\n*\"the intra-family faxes, which appeared so mysteriously on the Floppy Disks, are intended to fill the gap between the 6.04 percent that you* *started with and the 35-odd percent that you transferred\"* (Tr 2100:14-2100:18).\n\nHakan Uzan\u2019s reply in that regard was merely that: *\"The intra-family transactions and the sale to Libananco are two different things\"* (Tr 2100:19-2100:20).\n\n228.3 Hakan Uzan was asked what purpose would be served in having Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan transfer shares to him, only for him to then transfer them on to Libananco. His reply was that: *\"As part of the divorce, my brother wanted all things to be documented, all the intra-family share sales to be documented, so that there is no misunderstanding or dispute later\"* (Tr 2103:9-2103:12). When pressed to explain the complex nature of the transactions, he repeated his earlier answer and said: *\"Again, my brother wanted to have everything documented; and, as part of the family divorce, this is the way things got structured\"* (Tr 2106:18-2106:20).\n\n228.4 Hakan Uzan denied that the purpose of these roundabout transactions was to *\"supply the missing shares for [him] to transfer, pursuant to the Share Transfer Agreements, to Libananco\"* (Tr 2107:7-2107:9). He explained that:\n\n*\"If you look starting in 1992 with the acquisition of the privatization of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares until including these, 2002 and 2003, you will see hundreds of these sort of transactions between family members, between companies, either done for accounting purposes, either done for dividend purposes, for whatever purposes they may have been at the time. It was a complex structure between family members and between companies, and that\u2019s the way they were done\"* (Tr 2107:14-2108:1).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that no evidence has been tendered of any such similar transactions.\n\n229.\n\nOn the related issue of the authenticity of Exhibit R-821, which purported to be a fax document detailing the breakdown of his family\u2019s shareholdings in various companies, including \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez (see paragraph 218 above), Hakan Uzan gave the following evidence.\n\n229.1 He confirmed that one of the reasons he disputed the authenticity of Exhibit R-821 was the fact that his secretary sat across from him, so there would be no need to send him a document via e-mail (Tr 2156:11-2156:20).\n\n229.2 He was asked whether the contents of Exhibit R-821 (i.e. the table representing shareholding structure within his immediate family) were being looked at closely at the time (i.e. 14 July 2003) because a freezing order had been made by a Turkish court on 4 July 2003 in relation to the assets of Kemal Uzan, Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan and other Uzan group companies. He initially denied that he was looking closely at the shareholding structure within his immediate family at that time (Tr 2166:1-2166:6). But he gave a different answer upon further questioning and agreed that, in the face of the freezing order, he would have been looking carefully at the shareholding structure within his family:\n\n*\"Well, if you assumed that these are correct, then that would be right, but it\u2019s not\"* (Tr 2166:19-2167:2).\n\n229.3 However, he said that the contents of Exhibit R-821 did indeed correctly represent the factual position in relation to his family\u2019s shareholdings in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez at some earlier point in time: *\"let's say, from roughly six months earlier or nine months earlier or one year earlier, then it would be a correct document\"* (Tr 2150:19-2150:22).\n\n*(e) The requirement of teslim and the third act of teslim (not previously mentioned) which allegedly took place in Istanbul*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nHakan Uzan was then cross-examined on the requirement of delivery or *teslim,* which was necessary to effect a valid transfer of ownership under Turkish law.\n\n230.1 Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence was that *\"as far as I know, then and today, bearer share certificates only need to be\u2014can be agreed in any form and need to be delivered to be valid\"* (Tr 2058:21-2059:2). Hakan Uzan therefore agreed that the STAs themselves could not effect a valid transfer of ownership because actual delivery of the share certificates was necessary - *\"the Share Transfer Agreements are or were not even necessary\"* (Tr 2059:10-2059:21).\n\n230.2 Hakan Uzan was later asked to confirm that **teslim** took place, firstly, over a telephone call to Switzerland in April 2003, and secondly, when Mr\u00a0\u00c7i\u011fgin inspected the share certificates in Istanbul on 15 May 2003. His response sought to introduce a third act of **teslim** not previously mentioned or referred to in his Witness Statement (or in any of the other witness statements tendered by the Claimant): *\"No. I mean, on the Vienna shares, they were sent by my father to our offices, to me. And, as I said, he actually called me and told me to go to the garage, which I did when the large denomination shares arrived at ikitelli offices\"* (Tr 2067:4-2067:8). Hakan Uzan testified that, sometime in May 2003, he took delivery of the large denomination \"Vienna shares\" (i.e. the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates that were produced in Vienna by the Claimant for inspection in these proceedings): *\"When they were sent from my father\u2019s offices to the ikitelli offices\"* (Tr 2068:11-2068:16).\n\n230.3 When asked why this was not captured in his Witness Statement, Hakan Uzan said:\n\n*\"It\u2019s the information I have. I mean, I told the lawyers when we were preparing my Witness Statement a lot of information, a lot of\u2014 regarding a lot of different subjects, and this is the draft that came out. Something not being in here doesn \u2019t mean there is something missing in the story or anything like that\"* (Tr 2067:22-2068:7).\n\nHe was unable to give any other explanation for this significant omission from his witness statement.\n\n231.\n\nHakan Uzan was subsequently cross-examined on the alleged *teslim* that took place in ikitelli (see paragraph 230.2 above).\n\n231.1 He gave evidence as follows:\n\n*\"The shares were sent by my father to our ikitelli offices. He telephoned me, and I went downstairs to the garage where the car came into and I guess that\u2019s where it took place... I believe it was the day that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin went to his part of the transaction\"* (Tr 2198:17-2199:1).\n\n231.2 Hakan Uzan thus confirmed that the delivery of share certificates that took place in ikitelli happened on the same day as Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin purported to take delivery of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates at the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings (Tr 2199:3-2199:7). He said that he received a telephone call from his father Kemal Uzan in the *\"early afternoon\"* (Tr 2240:16-2240:19). His evidence was that this phone call was made by his father Kemal Uzan from his (i.e. Kemal Uzan\u2019s) office, which was: *\"Either in the Dogus and the Adabank Building or from the house\"* (Tr 2264:7-2264:13).\n\n231.3 Hakan Uzan said that the share certificates in question were moved from a safe in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings to the garage in the ikitelli Building, where they were then delivered to him and subsequently moved to the safe of Cem Uzan (Tr 2199:15-2200:6) on the fifth floor of the Iketeli Building (Tr 2204:2-2204:10). At that point in time, those share certificates were being held on behalf of Libananco (presumably by Cem Uzan, since those share certificates were kept in his safe) (Tr 2204:11-2204:15).\n\n231.4 He agreed that the sequence of events was that the share certificates were moved from the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings (after Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin allegedly inspected the share certificates and took delivery of the latter on behalf of Libananco) to the ikitelli Building (Tr 2200:4-2200:22). His evidence was that:\n\n*\"My father\u2019s office was on the same floor of the Dogus Building, so the safes were in the other bank building in ikitelli. So, they were visited there by Mr. (\u00c7i\u011fgin and then later put in cars to be sent to me in ikitelli\"* (Tr 2242:16-2242:20).\n\n231.5 He said that the share certificates were wrapped in packages at the time he received them in Iketli:\n\n*\"The corners were ripped. They were some that had like packaging on the side but not on the top... My father sent me (\u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez* *shares. From the ones that I saw on top, that was it. I mean, it wasn\u2019t going to be paper wrapped underneath\"* (Tr 2205:15-2206:11).\n\n231.6 He was asked whether there was any list that accompanied delivery of those share certificates which would identify the share certificates which were allegedly delivered. His reply was that: *\"There may have been [such a list], I don\u2019t recall... I don\u2019t recall a document, so I donI know what happened to something that I don\u2019t recall\"* (Tr 2206:12-2207:11).\n\n231.7 Hakan Uzan was asked to clarify whether the share certificates that were allegedly delivered to him in ikitelli were the same as those that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin purported to accept (on behalf of Libananco) in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings. His response was in the affirmative: *\"I believe they were all located in the same place, so most likely they would be the same. He [i.e. Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin] would have seen these shares as well\"* (Tr 2242:7-2242:10).\n\n*(f) The circumstances surrounding teslim that allegedly occurred in relation to the share certificates located in Switzerland*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nIn relation to the remaining act of delivery or *teslim* alleged by the Claimant, Hakan Uzan was referred to paragraph 26 of his Witness Statement, where he deposed that share certificates located in Switzerland were delivered to Mr T\u00fcrkkan by means of a phone call in *\"April 2002\".* He later clarified that this was an error, and the month should have been April 2003 instead (Tr 2236:21-2236:22). He gave the following evidence in relation to *teslim* that allegedly occurred in relation to the share certificates located in Switzerland.\n\n232.1 The share certificates in Switzerland were located on a property rented by his uncle Yavuz Uzan (Tr 2183:12-2184:1).\n\n232.2 No evidence was given by him as to how the share certificates were moved to that property (Tr 2184:2-2184:5).\n\n232.3 The alleged phone call was made by Hakan Uzan from Istanbul, to Mr T\u00fcrkkan who was at the time most probably in Jordan (Tr 2189:11-2190:1).\n\n232.4 Hakan Uzan took the share certificates to Switzerland in 1995. At the time, these shares were owned by members of his family (Tr 2190:20-2191:8).\n\n232.5 Hakan Uzan was unable to identify which of the share certificates in Switzerland were the subject of the alleged transfer referred to in paragraph 26 of his Witness Statement.\n\n232.6 When asked whether he knew that there were in fact no Kepez share certificates found in Switzerland, he replied that he did not know (Tr 2192:17-2193:5). When asked: *\"So, it\u2019s a very uncertain concept, your delivery, that it\u2019s delivery of something you don\u2019t even know what it is your [sic] delivering; is that right?\"*, he replied:\n\n*\"Yes. But had the events in June and July [2003] not taken place, sooner or later they would have been relocated, just like the high volume shares were relocated by my father from the safe to me\"* (Tr 2194:10-2194:17).\n\n232.7 When asked whether he knew which share certificates or what he was allegedly delivering, Hakan Uzan replied: *\"I knew\u2014as far as I knew, it was \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares\"* (Tr 2195:8-2195:9). He said, however, that he did not know which shares specifically he purported to deliver (Tr 2195:10-2195:11). He also agreed that he took no steps to evidence which of the share certificates in Switzerland had allegedly been delivered: *\"Well, at the time when I talked to Cenk, I didn\u2019t; and, later on, if events hadn \u2019t occurredas they did, I wouldhave\"* (Tr 2196:1-2196:3).\n\n232.8 Hakan Uzan agreed that:\n\n*\"At the time there was absolutely no way anybody going into this apartment in Switzerland would be able to identify which Share Certificates were supposedly owned by Libananco and which were supposedly owned by other people\"* (Tr 2196:16-2196:21).\n\n**6. First Witness Statement of Ali Cenk T\u00fcrkkan dated 23 April 2009**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s First Witness Statement discussed the instructions he received from Hakan Uzan to establish a company in Cyprus, and the events that followed. Of particular interest and relevance is Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s role in the preparation of the STAs and the corporate documents of Libananco (including its board and management minutes) which Mr T\u00fcrkkan allegedly prepared. Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s First Witness Statement may, in broad terms, be broken down into the following areas or topics:\n\n(a) the circumstances surrounding his purchase of a holding company in Cyprus at the instruction of Hakan Uzan;\n\n(b) why it was necessary for him to reprint and re-sign the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002;\n\n(c) Libananco\u2019s corporate affairs, including its meetings conducted by Mr T\u00fcrkkan and the numerous STAs purportedly recording its acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez;\n\n(d) the circumstances surrounding the alleged delivery or *teslim* that occurred in relation to the share certificates located in Switzerland and istanbul; and\n\n(e) the alleged trust arrangement between Mr T\u00fcrkkan and Cem Uzan, which was brought to an end at the end of 2008.\n\n*(a) The circumstances surrounding Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s acquisition of Libananco and his travel to Cyprus in April 2002*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nIn early 2002, Mr T\u00fcrkkan was asked by Hakan Uzan to purchase or establish a company in Cyprus on trust for Hakan Uzan\u2019s family.\n\n235.\n\nFollowing this request, he researched professional service firms in Cyprus through the Internet to identify a firm that could assist him in this project:\n\n*\"After identifying a firm*  ***based on its website,***  *in March 2002, I telephoned Mr Antonios Partellas of the firm Partellas & Kiliaris, in Nicosia, Republic of Cyprus, and requested that his firm assist me in arranging the acquisition of a Cypriot company\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n236.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan deposed that:\n\n*\"After Mr. Partellas had arranged such an acquisition, namely of Libananco, I travelled to Nicosia, Republic of Cyprus in early April 2002. This was my first trip to the Republic of Cyprus, although I had spent time in the northern part of the island previously for business. I flew there on a non-stop Royal Jordanian flight from Amman and stayed two nights at Nicosia Hilton\".*\n\n237.\n\nApril 2002 was also Mr Turkkan's first meeting in person with Mr Partellas, and he discussed the general rules and organisation of Libananco, including the requirement that a majority of the board of directors had to be Cypriot nationals.\n\n238.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan stated that:\n\n*\"My acquisition of Libananco was recorded on an instrument of transfer dated 1 April 2002... I had never met or communicated with Mr. Sarris or anyone at Prontoservus prior to 1 April 2002, when I participated by telephone, in a meeting arranged for the appointment of a new Board of Directors for Libananco\".*\n\n239.\n\nOn 1 April 2002:\n\n*\"the two original directors of the company, as well as the corporate secretary - Mr. Polakis Sarris - resigned their positions and a new Board of Directors and corporate secretary - namely, Latimer Management Services, Ltd. - were appointed\".*\n\nThereafter, Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors consisted of Mr Turkkan, as well as Andreas Partellas and Antonia Kyriakou (both of whom were citizens of and resident in Cyprus).\n\n*(b) The Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002 memorialising Mr Turkkan's acquisition of Libananco*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nIn relation to the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002, Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s First Witness Statement was as follows.\n\n240.1 *\"When I arrived in Cyprus shortly thereafter, Mr. Antonios Partellas had only some of the relevant paperwork ready for me to sign during my visit. Indeed, it was only after I returned to Amman that I received from Mr. Partellas a copy of the instrument of transfer signed by Mr. Sarris and a witness, along with an unsigned counterpart of the same document. I signed the unsigned counterpart of the instrument of transfer, along with a witness (Mr. Ali Betar, an attorney in Jordan) and returned the signed original to Mr. Partellas for placement in Libananco\u2019s files. In other words, in April 2002, the four signatures were not on the same original page, but on two separate and identical counterparts\".*\n\n240.2 *\"Sometime in 2007, Crowell & Moring... asked me if I had with me in Jordan the original or a copy of the instrument of transfer which I had signed in April 2002, and which they informed me was missing from the company files in the Republic of Cyprus\".*\n\n240.3 Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed that he had not kept a copy, and had checked with Mr Partellas and Mr Betar (who had witnessed his signature of the document in April 2002), all of whom said they had not kept a copy. He deposed that Mr Betar, as his business lawyer, asked him why he was concerned with this document as ownership of Libananco had been transferred in 2002 and publicly registered in his name in 2005. According to Mr T\u00fcrkkan, Mr Betar suggested that he:\n\n*\"simply re-sign another copy of the document in order to put Libananco\u2019s files in complete and good order and that, in his opinion as a business lawyer, this would have no legal effect on my [i.e. Mr Turkkan's] ownership of the company. I therefore went to his [i.e. Mr Betar\u2019s] Amman law office with a printed copy of the April 2002 version signed by Mr. Sarris and his witness. Mr. Betar and I then resigned that version and I sent it to Mr. Partellas in Nicosia to put Libananco\u2019s files in good order\".*\n\n240.4 Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed that:\n\n*\"When I sent the re-signed document back to the company files, it was my intention to simply put them in good order. Had I known at that time that any question would be raised in this case regarding the date of this document, I would have notified Crowell & Moring that I had re-printed and re-signed the document in 2007\".*\n\n*(c) Libananco\u2019s corporate affairs including its meetings conducted by Mr T\u00fcrkkan and the numerous STAs purportedly recording its acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nOn 10 July 2002, Libananco held its first Board of Directors meeting under Mr Turkkan's direction. In that meeting, he was appointed as Libananco\u2019s General Manager by the Board of Directors. Mr Turkkan deposed that, although the beneficial and legal ownership of Libananco had undergone changes between 2002 and the present, the same directors (Antonia Kyriakou, Andreas Partellas and Mr Turkkan himself), secretary (Latimer Management Services Ltd. (\"Latimer\")) and auditor (Alliot Partellas Kilaris Ltd.) remained in their positions up to the date that Mr Turkkan made his First Witness Statement (i.e. 23 April 2009).\n\n242.\n\nMr Turkkan deposed that Libananco\u2019s management and board meetings took place in the following manner.\n\n242.1 All Management Committee and Board of Directors meetings took place by telephone: *\"Board meetings were conducted in Nicosia, Republic of Cyprus (although I always attended the meetings telephonicallyf'.*\n\n242.2 Minutes were then prepared by him on a computer and hard copies were printed and circulated by fax for signature, *\"and then replaced by hard-copy originals which were kept in Libananco\u2019s corporate files in the Republic of Cyprus*\n\n242.3 Mr Turkkan stated that: *\"I printed out in hard copy and personally signed each and every one of the Management Committee and Board of Directors minutes, within a few days or weeks of the meeting held\".*\n\n242.4 Mr Turkkan further stated that:\n\n*\"whenever I created a set of minutes on the computer... I also saved these minutes electronically on a floppy disk... to maintain copies of these files, separate from the official and signed hard-copy records in the Republic of Cyprus, so that I could retrieve them and refer to them as needed for purposes of conducting company business as General Manager. I have provided all of these floppy disks to Crowell & Moring\".*\n\n243.\n\nMr Turkkan gave evidence in relation to the process by which Libananco allegedly acquired ownership of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. Contrary to Cem Uzan\u2019s testimony in his First Witness Statement that the share transfer process began in October 2002 (see paragraph 168 above), Mr Turkkan testified that:\n\n*\"... by the end of Summer or early Fall 2002, Hakan Uzan told me that the company would begin acquiring bearer shares in the two Utilities from members of the Uzan family, so that it would have, in the future, a sufficient capital base to begin investment activities outside of Turkey.*\n\n*In*  ***September 2002,***  *therefore, Libananco began the process to acquire these shares*\n\n*(emphasis added)*\n\n244.\n\nAs to the mechanics of the share acquisition process, Mr Turkkan deposed as follows:\n\n*\"As recorded in the 23 September 2002 Management Committee minutes, Mr. Saylan (\u00c7i\u011fgin (Libananco\u2019s internal legal advisor) prepared the template share transfer agreement text that was later used in the acquisition by Libananco of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez shares from Kemal, Hakan and Aysegul Uzan.*\n\n*However, the process by which these share transfer documents were completed and signed were as follows: (a) first, I would receive a fax from istanbul to prepare a share transfer agreement (per Mr. (\u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s template) on a particular date, for a specified amount of shares; (b) I would prepare the document in duplicate, print both copies, and send one with my signature and one without my signature to Turkey; (c) the relevant transferor (either Kemal Hakan or Aysegul Uzan would receive and review both of the documents and sign the unsigned version; (d) I would receive their signed version back in Amman,*  ***though often I would receive several of these signed documents at the same time in bundles; (e) sometimes, I would not receive a particular document back at all, and I would then have to create another one and go through the same process again; (f) I would then sign the documents I had received from Turkey (either individually or in stacks or bundles, depending on how I received them; and (g) after all the agreements had been executed, I personally took all of them to Cyprus in a single package and told Mr. Antonios Partellas, the corporate secretary to place them in Libananco\u2019s corporate files\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*(d) The circumstances surrounding the alleged delivery of the share certificates located in Switzerland and istanbul*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nMr Turkkan had the following to say in his First Witness Statement about the alleged delivery or *teslim* in respect of the share certificates located in Switzerland and istanbul:\n\n*\"During this process, sometime in April 2003, I was contacted by Hakan Uzan, who informed me that some of the bearer shares in the Utilities that he intended to transfer to Libananco (and that were contained in the percentage of shares listed in the share transfer agreements)*  ***were being held for the company in custody in Switzerland.***  *As Libananco\u2019s General Manager, I acknowledged my agreement to this arrangement. Shortly thereafter, Hakan Uzan also* *told me that from now on I would own Libananco in trust solely for Cem Uzan.*\n\n*On 18 April 2003, the Management Committee decided to instruct Mr. Saylan \u00c7i\u011fgin to visit the offices in Istanbul where the bearer shares located in Turkey were stored and physically*  ***re-check***  *the storage of the shares and their labelling under Libananco\u2019s name. I telephoned Mr. \u00c7i\u011fgin (who was in Istanbul) and told him to inspect those bearer shares and*  ***conduct an inventory at the istanbul storage facilities to accept delivery on behalf of Libananco. Around the same time, Mr. Cem Uzan made arrangements to transport the most valuable of those shares to a separate secure location for Libananco.***  *Also, Mr. (\u00c7i\u011fgin sent me, by fax, two share custody agreements, dated [16]7 May 2003, according to which the less valuable bearer shares were to continue to be held at the same location for Libananco, under the custody of \u00c7i\u011fgin and Kepez respectively\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan clarified during direct examination that the date on which he received the two share custody agreements was 16 May 2003 and not 15 May 2003 as printed at paragraph 25 of his First Witness Statement (Tr 2295:7-2295:12).\n\n*(e) Change in legal ownership of Libananco and transfer of the company to Cem Uzan*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nLast, Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed that the legal ownership of Libananco changed in January 2009 when he transferred the company to Cem Uzan:\n\n*\"At the end of 2008, Cem Uzan informed me that he wanted to bring our trust arrangement to an end and acquire outright legal ownership of Libananco. Thus, on 12 January 2009, I signed an instrument of transfer in which Cem Uzan acquired 100 percent of Libananco\u2019s shares directly from me, thereby becoming the sole legal owner of the company\".*\n\n**7. Second Witness Statement of Ali Cenk T\u00fcrkkan dated 8 October 2009**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s Second Witness Statement was given essentially in response to an allegation made by the Respondent in the R.Rep.Supp filed on 14 August 2009 (see paragraph 6 and paragraphs 81 to 85 of the R.Rep.Supp), described in summary below.\n\n248.\n\nOn 15 July 2009, the Claimant provided for the first time the hand stamp purportedly used to place Libananco\u2019s common seal on (at least some of) the STAs bearing dates from the period October 2002 to May 2003. The Respondent submitted in its R.Rep.Supp that it obtained evidence to show that the hand stamp produced was of a \"Shiny\" brand model, and could not have been purchased in Cyprus before February 2005.\n\n249.\n\nThe Respondent accordingly argued that the STAs (or at the very least some of them) were backdated, since the \"Shiny\" stamp used to apply the Libananco seal was only commercially available long after the STAs were alleged to have been executed.\n\n250.\n\nMr Turkkan's answer to this allegation was that the hand stamp which was produced (i.e. the \"Shiny\" brand model) was not in fact the one which was originally used to stamp the STAs executed between October 2002 and May 2003. His evidence was that the stamp machine first used was a different one, and that the second stamp machine (i.e. the \"Shiny brand model) was purchased because the first stamp machine broke in 2005 when he was in transit to Cyprus.\n\n251.\n\nHis evidence in his Second Witness Statement was as follows.\n\n251.1 *\"Sometime in the late summer or early fall of*  ***2002,***  *I had a Libananco corporate stamp made at a local firm in Amman so that I could use it to stamp company-related documents. This stamp was installed on a small, plastic stamp machine.*  ***I have no clear recollection but believe that the type of stamp machine may have been a Trodat.***  *The body of the stamp is a small manufactured device. The imprint of the stamp, the medallion, has to be custom made and I had one made that bore the name Libananco\"* (emphasis added).\n\n251.2 He would use the stamp machine described above (i.e. the first stamp machine) to apply the stamp to the signature page of the agreement after he signed the STA containing the seller\u2019s signature, sometimes individually and sometimes in a group with other agreements.\n\n251.3 In early November 2005, he travelled again to Nicosia, Cyprus *\"to meet lawyers from the United States who were coming to inspect Libananco corporate documents in order to evaluate a possible legal claim for the company\".*\n\n251.4 *\"[B]efore meeting with the lawyers, I met with Mr. Antonis Partellas... I brought with me to that meeting all of the original share transfer agreements, which I had kept such originals in my offices in Amman since before the June 2003 seizure of the assets. The purpose of the meeting was to make sure Mr. Partellas could make the corporate file available to the visiting lawyers, and to place the original share transfer agreements in that file\".*\n\n251.5 *\"I also brought with me the Libananco corporate stamp I had purchased back in 2002 and had used to stamp the agreements. When I arrived in Nicosia, I noticed the stamp machine had a broken plastic leg piece and was no longer functioning. I showed the stamp machine to Mr. Partellas, whose office was able to obtain another stamp machine very similar to the broken one. I do not know if his office bought a new one or had an extra one in their office. I recall taking the Libananco medallion off* *the old stamp machine and placed it onto the new machine provided by Mr. Partellas\u2019 office. I left the stamp machine with Mr. Partellas\u2019 office because I did not want to break it again, and because it was my practice to leave all Libananco-related files and paperwork in Cyprus\".*\n\n251.6 *\"I believe that I applied the stamp to the share transfer agreements in 2002 and 2003 sometime around the time I signed them for the company as the buyer. I am told that it is possible some of the STAs may have been stamped in Cyprus when I visited in November 2005. Frankly, it is possible that I may have done that on a few of the STAs but I simply do not have any specific memory of doing so\".*\n\n**8. Cross-examination of Mr T\u00fcrkkan**\n--------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe cross-examination of Mr T\u00fcrkkan covered the following areas:\n\n(a) the circumstances surrounding the formation of Libananco;\n\n(b) the alleged trust arrangement between him and members of the Uzan family;\n\n(c) the minutes of the board and management meetings of Libananco;\n\n(d) the omission of significant facts or events from Libananco\u2019s minutes;\n\n(e) the circumstances surrounding the alleged \"family divorce\", specifically how faxes purportedly evidencing intra-family share transfers came to be found on his floppy disks even though he was not responsible for, and did not assist with, any of these transfers; and\n\n(f) the circumstances surrounding the alleged delivery or *teslim* in relation to the share certificates located in both Switzerland and istanbul.\n\n*(a) Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s involvement in the creation of Libananco*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to paragraph 12 of his First Witness Statement:\n\n*\"I researched professional service firms in the Republic of Cyprus through the internet to identify a firm that could assist me in this project. After identifying a firm*  ***based on its website,***  *in March 2002, I telephoned Mr. Partellas...\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n253.1 It was put to Mr T\u00fcrkkan that Mr Partellas did not have a website until late 2002. Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s response was that it was not actually Mr Partellas\u2019 (or that of his firm\u2019s) website that he found: *\"what Iflnded [sic] on the internet, it was a Web site containing all the accountant or law* *firms of the Cypriot. It is like a directory or yellow pages, and I finded their information from there\"* (Tr 2373:21-2374:3).\n\n253.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan agreed that he knew absolutely nothing about Mr Partellas\u2019 firm other than that his firm was on a list of lawyers and accountants in Cyprus that was located as a result of an Internet search (Tr 2374:22-2375:5).\n\n253.3 When asked by the Tribunal why he chose Mr Partellas\u2019 firm over other firms listed on the Internet, his response was:\n\n*\"As I remember when I flnded this list, I start to call, and I believe his name was on the top, maybe because his name is starting with A. And I remember I called several companies, but they were not speaking in English, or I didn\u2019t reach them. This was the first company where I reached them, and they said they can help me\"* (Tr 2745:10-2745:17).\n\n254.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was asked whether he had met Mr Partellas before, and whether he had any prior business dealings with him. His response to both questions was negative (Tr 2381:12-2381:17). He agreed that a fee would be payable to Mr Partellas (or his firm) for the acquisition or incorporation of a company in Cyprus. He said that the fee quoted was 1,500 Cypriot pounds, and that it was paid over to Mr Partellas on 1 April 2002 when he (i.e. Mr T\u00fcrkkan) was in Cyprus (Tr 2382:6-2382:11).\n\n254.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was asked: *\"So, Mr. Partellas and Mr. Sarris, who never met you before, are apparently taking entirely on trust that you will pay them the money; is that right?\"*, to which his response was: *\"Yes, sir\"* (Tr 2381:21-2382:20).\n\n254.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan also agreed that Mr Partellas would have given him an invoice for the payment received, and that this invoice could be found in either his files or Mr Partellas\u2019 files. However, he said that he did not have the invoice, and he did not know whether Mr Partellas had the invoice. When asked by the Tribunal whether he in fact got a receipt for payment, his answer was unhelpful: *\"What I remember, I getted [sic] some document, sir\"* (Tr 2400:4-2401:4).\n\n254.3 In any event, Mr T\u00fcrkkan contradicted his earlier evidence because he later admitted (when presented with the 2002 financial statements of Libananco) that no money was in fact paid to Mr Partellas\u2019 firm until around the end of 2005 (Tr 2591:18-2592:5). Again, he was unable to explain why Mr Partellas\u2019 firm would be willing to provide services on credit for a period of some three years (Tr 2592:11-2592:15). However, this is consistent with Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence that Libananco only opened a bank account *\"around 2005... In Cyprus\"* (Tr 2593:13-2593:22).\n\n254.4 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to Exhibit H-22, which was Libananco\u2019s 2002 financial statements. Page 12 of that document records the *\"Administrative Expenses for the period ended 31 December 2002\".* This was further broken down into the following components: legal and professional fees (US$ 25,500); secretarial fees (US$1,200); miscellaneous (US$12,350); accountancy fees (US$5,000); and audit fees (US$15,000). Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was that:\n\n***\"most of the expenses here are also not the expense which is paid.*** *These are just recorded for the accounting base... these amounts paid later on by the Libananco to them [i. e. Mr Partellas\u2019 firm and other professionals who rendered services to Libananco]...*  ***Around like Year 2005,***  *and I have some monies for the Libananco, and I make it these expenses for them\"* (Tr 2574:22-2576:10).\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nHe confirmed again that expenses recorded in Libananco\u2019s 2002 financial statements were not in fact paid in 2002, but rather in 2005 - the reason for their appearance in Libananco\u2019s 2002 financial statements was that they were *\"recording [sic] as a provision\"* (Tr 2576:11-2576:18).\n\n255.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to paragraph 14 of his First Witness Statement *(\"I had never met or communicated with Mr. Sarris or anyone at Prontoservus prior to 1 April 2002, when I participated, by telephone, in a meeting arranged for the appointment of a new Board of Directors for Libananco*\n\n255.1 When asked to explain why both Mr Partellas and Mr Sarris testified that no such board meeting took place on 1 April 2002, Mr T\u00fcrkkan initially said that this was because the meeting took place over the telephone, but later said that there was in fact no telephone call: *\"Sir, this Board meeting done, and it was done through the telephonically... There was nobody on the telephone call, sir... there is no direct telephone call like this. It is a paper meeting\"* (Tr 2378:10-2379:3).\n\n255.2 When asked to clarify the phrase *\"I participated, by telephone\"* (paragraph 14 of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s First Witness Statement), he said that:\n\n*\"It means that there is a meeting done, it is type [sic], it\u2019s printed, and everybody knows that there is a meeting done, but nobody was in the same time... this is by telephone. This is not a direct one because it is a paper meeting\"* (Tr 2379:9-2379:17).\n\n256.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to paragraph 12 of his First Witness Statement, where he deposed that he flew to Nicosia, Cyprus in early April 2002 on a *\"non-stop Royal Jordanian flight\".*\n\n256.1 He said that he stayed two nights at the Nicosia Hilton. When presented with correspondence from Hilton International that it had no record of him staying there in 2002, he replied: *\"I stayed on the 1st of April, fd of April, at the Hilton Hotel... it says it right on their letter that I was staying or not staying\".* When it was put to him that the correspondence from Hilton International confirmed that it had no record of any person known as *\"Ali T\u00fcrkkan\"* having stayed at the hotel then, he replied: *\"I\u2019m not Ali T\u00fcrkkan, sir... I\u2019m Ali Cenk T\u00fcrkkan\"* (Tr 2397:19-2397:21).\n\n256.2 The question was posed by the Respondent\u2019s counsel to Mr T\u00fcrkkan: *\"Is it your evidence that rather than having gone for a nonstop flight, as appears in your Witness Statement, you, in fact, went on an indirect flight via Beirut?\".* He responded: *\"Sir, I fly there from Amman to Lamaca... it was a direct flight... The planes stop in Beirut, but it was not via Beirut\".* Mr T\u00fcrkkan explained that it was a *\"nonstop\"* flight because: *\"Ididn\u2019t get out from the plane\"* (Tr 2398:10-2399:7).\n\n257.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to paragraph 14 of his First Witness Statement (see paragraph 240.1 above), where he deposed that Mr Partellas only had some of the relevant paperwork ready for him to sign when he arrived in Cyprus in April 2002, and that he only received the Instrument of Transfer from Mr Partellas by mail once he returned to Amman, Jordan.\n\n257.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan said that he was shown (but not given) the Instrument of Transfer when he was in Cyprus: *\"He [i.e. Mr Partellas] showed me what he didn\u2019t give me [sic], sir\"* (Tr 2391:18-2391:19).\n\n257.2 When asked why Mr Partellas did not give it to him, his response was that: *\"Maybe I forgot to take it from him\"* (Tr 2392:1).\n\n257.3 When asked to clarify why then it was said in his First Witness Statement that some of the relevant paperwork was not ready for him to sign, Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s reply was contradictory: *\"No, sir. The documents was ready for to sign [sic], but I didn\u2019t signed [sic] it. My request is from him I want to sign this document on [sic] front of my lawyer, and he is my witnesses [sic]\"* (Tr 2392:6-2392:9).\n\n258.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was again referred to paragraph 14 of his First Witness Statement (see paragraph 240.1 above). He was asked why he did not sign the \"original\" Instrument of Transfer which was signed by Mr Sarris and his witness. He replied:\n\n*\"Because they are the original documents, sir... Because, if I signed it, the original document to Cyprus, I have no document in my hand... The important signature of the third parties [sic] which they were selling the company to us, that\u2019s why it is the important one which I keep it with [sic] on our side\"* (Tr 2407:4-2407:22).\n\n259.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was then referred to his First Witness Statement, in which he deposed that he reprinted and re-signed the Instrument of Transfer in 2007.\n\n259.1 He was asked how he was able to print a copy of the Instrument of Transfer with only Mr Sarris\u2019 and his (i.e. Mr Sarris\u2019) witness\u2019 signature on it. He was asked whether it was saved on a computer as an electronic file. His response was: *\"I don\u2019t remember, sir\"* (Tr 2411:12).\n\n259.2 He was asked how else he would have been able to print it (i.e. the Instrument of Transfer with only two signatures on it) unless it had been saved as a PDF file on a computer. His response was: *\"Sir, I don\u2019t remember\"* (Tr 2411:15).\n\n259.3 He was asked if he could explain how he was able to obtain a copy of the Instrument of Transfer with only two signatures on it, assuming this was done other than by printing it from a computer. His response was: *\"Sir, I don\u2019t remember how I did get this document\"* (Tr 2411:19-2411:20).\n\n259.4 He was asked whether, if that document had been reprinted in 2007 as he alleges, that would indicate that the document was indeed saved at some earlier stage onto his computer. His reply was: *\"I don\u2019t remember, sir\"* (Tr 2412:5).\n\n259.5 When asked directly how he was able to print or reprint that document, his response was similar: *\"I don\u2019t remember, sir\"* (Tr 2413:6).\n\n259.6 Although Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed at paragraph 15 of his First Witness Statement that:\n\n*\"I had sent the original [Instrument of Transfer] back to Mr. Partellas in April 2002, and had not kept a copy... [In 2007,] I therefore went to his [i.e. Mr Betar \u2019s] Amman law office with a printed copy of the April 2002 version signed by Mr. Sarris and his witness. Mr. Betar and I then re-signed that version, and I sent it to Mr. Partellas in Nicosia to put Libananco\u2019s files in good order\",*\n\nhe later appeared to give evidence to the contrary. When asked by the Tribunal whether Mr Sarris signed a new copy of the Instrument of Transfer, Mr T\u00fcrkkan said that this was not the case as he (and Mr Betar) simply signed the same copy of the Instrument of Transfer that was originally signed by Mr Sarris in 2002 (Tr 2749:22-2750:10). Mr T\u00fcrkkan said: *\"We just signed the copy which was signed by Mr. Sarris and his witness... [That] document was signed in the Year 2002\"* (Tr 2750:5-2750:10). This is contrary to his evidence in paragraph 15 of his First Witness Statement, which states that he had not kept a copy of the original Instrument of Transfer signed by Mr Sarris and his (i.e. Mr Sarris\u2019) witness.\n\n*(b) The alleged trust arrangement between Mr T\u00fcrkkan and members of the Uzan family*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nIn relation to the alleged trust arrangement in respect of Libananco, Mr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to paragraph 11 of his First Witness Statement (\"... *in early 2002.1 was asked by Hakan Uzan to purchase or establish a company in the Republic of Cyprus in trust for his family\").* He gave the following evidence.\n\n260.1 When asked: *\"If you are going to operate or manage property on somebody else\u2019s behalf, you\u2019ve got to know who the somebody else is,* *don\u2019t you?\",* Mr T\u00fcrkkan replied that: *\"It depends on the laws of the country... I\u2019m not an expert on this matter; and, as I know, it depends on the country\u2019s law\"* (Tr 2355:16-2356:8).\n\n260.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was asked whether he knew which law was applicable to the alleged trust arrangement. His reply was that: *\"The trust belong to Cyprus, sir, Republic of Cyprus\".* He agreed, however, that he did not take any advice on the Cypriot law of trusts, and that he did not know anything about the Cypriot law of trusts (Tr 2357:3-2357:16).\n\n260.3 When asked if he knew what the terms of the alleged trust were, he said that: *\"on the beginning, nobody told me about the term of the trusting [sic]\"* (Tr 2357:18-2357:19).\n\n260.4 Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was specifically that, when Hakan Uzan asked him to establish a company in Cyprus to be held on trust for his family, Hakan Uzan did not say for whose benefit that company would be held: *\"when he [i.e. Hakan Uzan] told me this, he didn\u2019t clarify exactly what is the members of his family\"* (Tr 2357:20-2359:2).\n\n*(c) The minutes of Libananco\u2019s board and management meetings*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to paragraph 19 of his First Witness Statement *(\"... Board meetings were conducted in Nicosia, Republic of Cyprus (although I always attended the meetings telephonically)\").* He was asked by the Tribunal to clarify what this meant. His response was:\n\n*\"When I prepared the Minutes, I was sending the fax to Nicosia, to Mr. Partellas\u2019 office, and I was telling him he will receive these documentations related to what it was [sic]. And I was requesting [sic] him to get the signature of Directors and also file it on the corporate files of Libananco in Cyprus on his office was keeping. That is the practice.*  ***But I never called them and we were not in the same time on the telephone.***  *I explained then what was certain, it was writing on the documentation, and later on Mr. Partellas receive [sic] it, and they signed it on the document that I faxed to them\"* (Tr 2430:7-2430:19).\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n262.\n\nHis evidence in respect of the following documents was similarly to the effect these were all paper meetings which nobody attended, notwithstanding that it was recorded on the face of these documents that the directors of Libananco were present:\n\n262.1 Exhibit H-14, which were the Minutes of Libananco\u2019s Management Committee Meeting of 23 September 2002;\n\n262.2 Exhibit H-29, which were the Minutes of Libananco\u2019s Management Committee Meeting of 20 February 2003; and\n\n262.3 Exhibit H-50, which were the Minutes of Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Meeting of 18 April 2003.\n\n263.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to Exhibit H-13, which were the Minutes of Libananco\u2019s Directors\u2019 Meeting of 23 September 2002, a document allegedly drafted by him.\n\n263.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was questioned whether he drafted the minutes personally. His response was that he did (Tr 2324:20-2325:2).\n\n263.2 He was asked to explain the meaning of the term *\"mercantile transaction\"* (which appears in paragraph 7(b) of that document). He first asked for a translation, but admitted that he did not know the meaning of that term (Tr 2442:6-2442:15).\n\n263.3 He was unable to explain how he was able to draft paragraph 7(b) of that document, which referred to giving himself authority for monetary or mercantile transactions (Tr 2442:17-2442:22).\n\n263.4 When asked to explain the meaning of *\"debenture\",* a term which appears in paragraph 7(d) of that document, he replied: *\"I have to check on [sic] the dictionary, sir\"* (Tr 2443:2).\n\n263.5 When asked whether that document had in fact been prepared by an English speaker rather than by a Turkish speaker, he said: *\"It could be, sir... I was asking some several persons in my office to check my English documents always\".* When asked who these persons were, he said: *\"There were lots, sir. I don\u2019t remember their name\"* (Tr 2443:22-2444:13).\n\n264.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was that, in November 2005 (Tr 2456:9), he reprinted and signed *\"all the Minutes of the Directors and all the Minutes of the Management... I printed it over [sic] again in Cyprus\"* (Tr 2455:14-2455:16).\n\n264.1 He confirmed this during direct examination, where his evidence was that, when he initially met with lawyers from Crowell & Moring LLP in November 2005, he brought with him a laptop computer that had the electronic versions of the STAs and the board and management minutes stored on it (Tr 2298:13-2298:17). At that time, he *\"reprinted all the documents again, and [he] completed the documents with the [sic] resigning the documents\" -* the reason being that:\n\n*\"there was [sic] some documents was [sic] missing and some documents was not readably [sic] very well because they are the fax, and because of it is [sic] fax, they were darker, and some were not working because the fax\u2014it was not coming correctly on the fax machine mainly\"* (Tr 2298:13-2299:10).\n\n264.2 However, he denied that those minutes were being printed for the very first time in November 2005: \"... *in 2002, 2003, 2004, they were signed.* *One copy was with me, and one copy was in the corporate files in Cyprus\"* (Tr 2456:15-2456:17).\n\n264.3 His evidence was that the documents (i.e. the board and management minutes) produced in the arbitration were the ones printed in Cyprus in 2005, and that the versions that had existed prior to November 2005 no longer existed (Tr 2456:18-2457:4).\n\n264.4 In relation to the previous version of the minutes which were not produced in the arbitration, he said: \"... *after I reprinted and re-signed, I put them out... I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s gone, but it\u2019s not in the file\"* (Tr 2457:5-2457:12).\n\n265.\n\nIn relation to certain of Libananco\u2019s management and board minutes known as the \"Al\" minutes,8 Mr T\u00fcrkkan went further to say that these were drafted, printed and signed (Tr 2300:1-2300:4) in 2006: *\"Sir, these documents and Minutes of the Directors [sic] meeting, and I prepared year [sic] 2006 to complete my corporate records of Libananco\"* (Tr 2299:11-2299:22). His explanation for creating these documents in 2006 was as follows:\n\n*\"When I was checking my documents again, Ifound the Share Transfer Agreements quantities are not mentioned with the Director of\u2014the Minutes [sic]. That\u2019s why I completed my corporate files of Libananco. I prepared this Directors [sic] meeting, and I make it corporate files [sic]\"* (Tr 2473:3-2473:8).\n\nSo named because \"Al\" is printed on the face of each of these documents as part of the document reference numbers. The \"Al\" minutes were the following: Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors Meeting (Al), 15 November 2002 (Exhibit 11-19): Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors Meeting (Al), 20 February 2003 (Exhibit H-28); Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors Meeting (Al), 18 April 2003 (Exhibit H-51); and Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors Meeting (Al), 20 May 2003 (Exhibit H-63).\n\n*(d) The omission of significant facts or events from Libananco\u2019s minutes*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was cross-examined on two other aspects of Libananco\u2019s minutes.\n\n266.1 He was referred to Exhibit H-73, Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors\u2019 Meeting dated 11 March 2004. The first page of that document states, among other things: *\"AGENDA/MINUTES: Up Date on Developments of International Legal Options; Danistay Developments; European Court of Human Rights Developments\"*. He agreed that he followed the proceedings in the European Court of Human Rights (\"ECtHR\") and the Danistay closely. The case before the ECtHR was brought by Kemal Uzan, whose argued there was that he was the majority shareholder of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. Mr T\u00fcrkkan agreed this was wrong because Libananco (and not Kemal Uzan) was the majority shareholder in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez (Tr 2698:21-2699:9). He was asked to explain why there was no reference in Libananco\u2019s minutes noting that Kemal Uzan\u2019s case before the ECtHR was inconsistent with Libananco\u2019s position (i.e. that it was the majority shareholder in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez). Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s response was not on point: *\"Sir, on the report it is writing [sic] that there is a Application on [sic] the European Union\"* (Tr 2701:16-2701:22).\n\n266.2 Although the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates located in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings in istanbul were seized in March 2004, Mr T\u00fcrkkan had no explanation why the Libananco\u2019s minutes did not refer to the fact that share certificatess allegedly owned by Libananco had been seized by the Turkish Government (Tr 2702:14-2703:13).\n\n267.\n\nIn relation to dividend payments from \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to its shareholders, Mr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to Exhibit H-50, which were the Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors\u2019 Meeting dated 18 April 2003. He was unable to explain why there was nothing recorded in those minutes about dividend payments to Libananco (Tr 2626:5-2626:8). When asked in general about the laher dividends: *\"And so, if I were to ask you what happened to these dividends, what were the arrangements, the answer is you have no recollection and you have no evidence to give; is that fair?\",* Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s response was: *\"Yes,* sir\" (Tr 2626:19-2627:1).\n\n*(e) The alleged \"family divorce\" and how the intra-family faxes came to be discovered on Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s floppy disks*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was asked about the faxes purportedly evidencing intra-family share transfers, which were found as deleted files on his floppy disks and subsequently recovered.\n\n268.1 When asked whether he was aware of the alleged \"family divorce\", his response was: *\"Sir, this is their business. I have no idea what they were doing on their level\"* (Tr 2415:14-2415:15).\n\n268.2 When asked why he saved those documents onto his floppy disks, he replied: *\"Because I understand that they are the important documents like the Libananco documents, and I saved them\"* (Tr 2417:8-2417:10).\n\n268.3 When asked why he thought these documents were important, his response was: *\"Because there is a sales [sic] between the family members\"* (Tr 2417:12-2417:13). His evidence therefore shows that he was aware of the alleged intra-family share transfers between members of the Uzan family, even if he did not know about the alleged \"family divorce\" as such.\n\n268.4 When asked why he saved those faxes on his floppy disks before subsequently deleting them, he said: *\"They are the Sales Transfer Agreements between the family members. That\u2019s why I saved them to Floppy Disks... I assumed that they informed me that these documents came to me by mistakenly, so that\u2019s why I delete [sic] them\"* (Tr 2418:19-2419:4).\n\n268.5 However, he was unable to explain the circumstances in which those documents came to be saved on his floppy disks, and was likewise unable to explain the specific circumstances in which he deleted them (Tr 2419:22-2420:4).\n\n*(f) The circumstances surrounding the alleged delivery of share certificates located in Switzerland and istanbul to Libananco*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nIn relation to the issue of *teslim* or delivery of the shares allegedly purchased by Libananco, Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was: *\"there are some shares that were delivered in Switzerland at the beginning of April 2003\"* (Tr 2632:1-2632:3).\n\n269.1 However, he was unable to confirm or identify which of the share certificates in Switzerland were allegedly delivered to Libananco (Tr 2632:5-2632:7). He testified that he had no means of knowing which share certificates in Switzerland were the subject of the alleged *teslim,* and that he did not know whether anyone had any means of knowing the answer to that question (Tr 2633:14-2633:21). His evidence is also that no one provided him with any inventory or any other means by which he could have identified the share certificates located in Switzerland that were alleged to have been delivered to Libananco in early April 2003 (Tr 2635:8-2635:13).\n\n269.2 When asked how *teslim* in respect of these unidentified or unascertained shares could have been accomplished, his response was:\n\n*\"Sir, it was informed to me by Mr. Hakan Uzan that he delivered the shares to Mr. Cem Uzan by the name of Libananco; and after then, we were planning to make it all the [sic] teslim documentation for this... But later on what\u2019s [sic] happened for the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez we were not able to complete our teslim documentation\"* (Tr 2632:12-2633:6).\n\n269.3 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was also referred to Exhibit H-50, which were the Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors\u2019 Meeting dated 18 April 2003, and was asked why there was no reference in that document to the alleged *teslim* that took place in relation to the share certificates located in Switzerland. His response was that he did not know the answer to this question (Tr 2637:14-2637:19).\n\n269.4 Crucially, Mr T\u00fcrkkan then gave evidence that contradicted his earlier statement that the (unidentified) share certificates located in Switzerland had been *\"delivered in Switzerland at the beginning of April 2003\"* (see paragraph 269 above): *\"we were planning to make teslim later on\"* (Tr 2634:15-2634:16). He agreed that it was planned that *teslim* would occur, but did not in fact occur owing to the events of 12 June 2003 (i.e. the termination of the Concession Agreements held by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez) (Tr 2635:3-2635:6).\n\n270.\n\nStill on the issue of *teslim,* but in respect of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates located in istanbul, Mr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to paragraph 25 of his First Witness Statement (see paragraph 245 above).\n\n270.1 He confirmed that he did in fact make a telephone call to Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin on either 13 or 14 May 2003 (Tr 2569:10-2659:11), in which he told Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin to inspect the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates and conduct an inventory to accept delivery of the latter (Tr 2656:20-2657:2). He confirmed that by this he meant that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was to effect *teslim* in respect of the share certificates in istanbul on behalf of Libananco (Tr 2657:7-2657:10).\n\n270.2 At the time he instructed Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin. *teslim* in respect of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates in istanbul had not previously occurred (Tr 2657:12-2657:15).\n\n270.3 Delivery or *teslim* of those share certificates (i.e. those located in istanbul) only occurred on 15 May 2003, and not before (Tr 2658:11-2658:21).\n\n270.4 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was also referred to Exhibit H-52, which were the Minutes of the Libananco Management Committee Meeting dated 18 April 2003. The first page of that document states, among other things, that:\n\n*\"It is Agreed that Saylan \u00c7i\u011fgin, appoint a two lawyer team to go to site of the storage facilities, and actually physically recheck the storage of the shares, and the labeling of the storage under the name of Libananco. And to do this on a routine basis (once a month)\".*\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan was asked to explain the point of sending Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin to *\"recheck storage of the shares which had not yet been delivered to Libananco\".* His response was unhelpful: *\"Sir, later on doesn\u2019t happen something like this because teslim happened\"* (Tr 2660:5-2660:13).\n\n271.\n\nOn the related issue of the time of Libananco\u2019s acquisition of the share certificates in question, Mr T\u00fcrkkan was cross-examined on the following areas.\n\n271.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to Exhibit H-61, which was Libananco\u2019s Share Acquisition Report as of 20 May 2003. He confirmed that it was his evidence that Libananco could only acquire ownership of the share certificates in question after *teslim* had taken place (Tr 2681:18-2681:22).\n\n271.2 However, he was unable to explain why the Share Acquisition Report (i.e. Exhibit H-61) purported to show shares being acquired by Libananco on various dates between November 2002 and April 2003 in the case of \u00c7EA\u015e, and November 2002 and May 2003 in the case of Kepez. His response to this question was: *\"I don\u2019t know the reason why they are in the [sic] different dates, sir\"* (Tr 2682:6-2682:14).\n\n271.3 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was referred to Exhibit H-21, which were the Minutes of the Libananco Management Committee Meeting dated 10 December 2002. The first page of that document stated, among other things:\n\n*\"It is noted that the first share transaction has been completed; As such; \u00c7EA\u015e... 33,000,000 shares at 500 TL/shares - Class C, 16,500,000.000 TL nominal value shares were purchased on 11 November 2002. Payment of 8,250,000 USD has been paid to the seller Hakan Uzan; It is agreed that Cenk Turkkan take all necessary steps to record the acquired shares in the companies [sic] records\".*\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan confirmed his understanding that *teslim* or delivery of those shares to Libananco had not yet, at that time, taken place (Tr 2541:17-2541:19). His evidence was that he recorded that information in Libananco\u2019s minutes because he was told by Hakan Uzan that that transaction had been completed, and that Hakan Uzan was the person who told him what to record in Libananco\u2019s minutes (Tr 2542:11-2542:19).\n\n**9. First Witness Statement of Antonis Partellas dated 24 April 2009**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nMr Partellas\u2019 First Witness Statement was short, and described how he first came into contact with Mr T\u00fcrkkan in 2002, when Mr T\u00fcrkkan asked for his assistance to acquire a Cypriot company. He also gave evidence on the period during which Libananco allegedly acquired shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n273.\n\nMr Partellas deposed as follows.\n\n273.1 He was the director of Latimer, which had been the Corporate Secretary of Libananco since 2002.\n\n273.2 *\"In early 2002, Mr. Ali Cenk Turkkan contacted me and requested that I arrange to acquire a Cypriot company for him and his principal to use as an international business holding company.\"*\n\n273.3 *\"Iproceeded to contact a Cypriot lawyer, Mr. Polakis K. Sarris, whom I knew from previous experience to be competent in this area. On 1 April 2002, Mr. Sarris\u2019 corporate organization and administration firm, Prontoservus Ltd, transferred all the shares of an existing company, Libananco, to Mr. Turkkan. \"*\n\n273.4 *\"At the same time, the two original directors of Libananco and the Secretary resigned and new Directors and Secretary were appointed. Thereafter, Mr. Turkkan became the General Manager of Libananco and Latimer served at Mr. Turkkan's request as the Corporate Secretary of the company, a capacity in which it remains today.\"*\n\n273.5 *\"Pursuant to Libananco\u2019s business records, Libananco took steps to acquire 652,080,725 of stock in [\u00c7EA\u015e] and 144,864,544 shares of stock in [Kepez] between the period of 29 October 2002 and 16 May 2003.\"*\n\n274.\n\nMr Partellas also deposed that, as Libananco\u2019s corporate secretary, Latimer had custody of the minutes of Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors and Management Committee meetings.\n\n**10. Second Witness Statement of Antonis Partellas dated 8 October 2009**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nMr Partellas\u2019 Second Witness Statement was likewise short and given in circumstances similar to Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s Second Witness Statement; namely, in response to an allegation made by the Respondent in relation to the hand stamp that was used to apply Libananco\u2019s common seal to the STAs (see paragraphs 248 to 249 above).\n\n276.\n\nMr Partellas corroborated Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence that Mr T\u00fcrkkan brought the original hand stamp (i.e. not the \"Shiny\" brand model stamp that was produced in this arbitration) along with *\"certain documents from Amman, Jordan regarding Libananco\u2019s business*\n\n277.\n\nIn relation to the original hand stamp which allegedly broke in transit, Mr Partellas deposed as follows.\n\n277.1 *\"... Mr. Turkkan produced a few dozen documents from his attache and also removed a small stamp machine he had brought from Amman which apparently contained the corporate seal. At that time, I recollect that the stamp machine, which was a simple and small plastic device, had broken and would no longer operate\".*\n\n277.2 *\"As Mr. Turkkan wanted to leave the stamp machine and the papers with me as the corporate secretary, I instructed one of my staff to go to the Stellos Key Service to purchase a new stamp machine of similar size and utility...\".*\n\n277.3 *\"The new stamp machine was purchased for a small amount of cash. We did not purchase or have made a new \"Libananco\" corporate rubber medallion as that small piece from the machine brought from Jordan apparently was still in working order. I believe Mr. Turkkan may have removed the medallion from the old machine and applied it to the new machine, although I cannot be certain\".*\n\n278.\n\nMr Partellas also gave evidence on whether the new hand stamp machine that was purchased by his firm was used by Mr T\u00fcrkkan to stamp any documents. He deposed that:\n\n*\"At the time Mr Turkkan came to my office in*  ***November 2005, I believe he may have used the new machine to stamp a few of the documents.***  *I do not recall which of the documents were stamped by Mr. Turkkan at that time, or how many. However, I do recall that there were signatures on all of the documents which he had brought with him. Thereafter, we placed these documents in the existing Libananco file and they were produced for the lawyers when they arrived for their inspection\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n**11. Cross-examination of Mr Partellas**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nMr Partellas was cross-examined mainly on his involvement in the setting up of Libananco by Mr T\u00fcrkkan and its corporate affairs subsequent to that. The material evidence he gave during cross-examination may be broken down into the following broad areas or topics:\n\n(a) the time of his first contact and meeting with Mr T\u00fcrkkan in connection with the setting up of Libananco;\n\n(b) the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002 - specifically, why Mr T\u00fcrkkan did not sign this document even though he was allegedly in Cyprus on 1 April 2002;\n\n(c) whether and how he was paid his professional fees for the assistance that he allegedly rendered to Mr T\u00fcrkkan in connection with the setting up of Libananco;\n\n(d) why the financial statements and tax returns of Libananco were filed late;\n\n(e) whether the necessary permission was sought from the Cyprus Central Bank when Mr T\u00fcrkkan approached him to set up an offshore holding company in Cyprus; and\n\n(f) the board minutes of Libananco.\n\n*(a) Mr Partellas \u2019first meeting with Mr T\u00fcrkkan*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nIn relation to his initial contact with Mr T\u00fcrkkan, Mr Partellas confirmed that this was made over the telephone (Tr 916:6-916:9), towards the end of March 2002 (Tr 921:12-921:13). He said: *\"I was very surprised, to be honest, but I was also very curious to see why he needed the HAPS (ph.) company, and also he was a Turkish national living in Jordan. He was not in Turkey at the time\"* (Tr 913:4-913:7).\n\n281.\n\nAs to how Mr T\u00fcrkkan managed to identify his firm, Mr Partellas gave evidence as follows.\n\n281.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan found him *\"[t]hrough directories over the Internet\"* (Tr 916:14).\n\n281.2 It was put to Mr Partellas that his firm\u2019s web site had only been established late in 2002. On that basis, he was asked how Mr T\u00fcrkkan could have identified him in April 2002. His response was that: *\"we were listed in various directories [on the Internet]... Accountants in Cyprus, for example\"* (Tr 917:3-917:11).\n\n281.3 Mr Partellas accordingly agreed that, in April 2002, it would have been impossible for anyone to identify his firm via its website because one did not exist at that time (Tr 918:17-918:18).\n\n281.4 However, he said that: *\"It was possible to identify us from other sources\"* (Tr 918:15-918:16).\n\n282.\n\nMr Partellas confirmed that he first met Mr T\u00fcrkkan in person around the period 1 April to 2 April 2002, but he could not remember the exact day (Tr 930:21-931:1).\n\n282.1 He said it was possible that this meeting took place on 1 April 2002 (Tr 931:2-931:3). The location of the meeting was the lobby of the Hilton Hotel in Cyprus (Tr 1016:16-1016:17).\n\n282.2 When the Respondent\u2019s Counsel put to Mr Partellas that Mr T\u00fcrkkan was not in fact in Cyprus at that time, Mr Partellas said: *\"I am saying that he was there, and I saw him\"* (Tr 932:13-932:14).\n\n*(b) Why Mr T\u00fcrkkan did not sign the Instrument of Transfer even though he was allegedly in Cyprus on 1 April 2002*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nMr Partellas gave the following evidence in relation to Exhibit H-4, the Instrument of Transfer of shares in Libananco signed by Mr Sarris and Mr T\u00fcrkkan and dated 1 April 2002.\n\n283.1 He was asked why Mr T\u00fcrkkan did not sign the Instrument of Transfer when he was in Cyprus on 1 April 2002 (see paragraph 240.1 above). His response was:\n\n*\"Maybe it was not ready at that day. I cannot remember exactly... Maybe there was something missing or some mistake, and it was sent to him later... Maybe there was some mistake on [sic] the document. I cannot remember now\"* (Tr 936:6-937:1).\n\n283.2 He was asked about the version of the Instrument of Transfer that was actually signed by Mr T\u00fcrkkan. His response was: *\"This is given always to the beneficial owner, to the shareholder... We don\u2019t keep anything here\"* (Tr 938:2-938:3).\n\n283.3 The Respondent\u2019s Counsel pointed out to Mr Partellas that Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was that the signed original was in fact returned to Mr Partellas for placement in Libananco\u2019s files. Mr Partellas responded: *\"No, I\u2019m not sure if this is the case. Usually, one\u2014that is one Instrument of Transfer being prepared, and this is given to the owner\"* (Tr 938:9-938:11).\n\n*(c) Whether and how Mr T\u00fcrkkan paid Mr Partellas his fees for professional services allegedly rendered in connection with the setting up of Libananco*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nMr Partellas confirmed that whenever he conducted an audit, a professional fee would be charged, that fee would be recorded in an invoice, and there would *\"be a record of that fee... both within [his] firm\u2019s records and within the company\u2019s records being audited [sic]\"* (Tr 901:22-902:17).\n\n285.\n\nIn relation to the manner in which Mr T\u00fcrkkan paid for his firm\u2019s services, Mr Partellas gave the following evidence.\n\n285.1 *\"Mr. Turkkan paid us in cash when he came to Cyprus\"* (Tr 922:13-922:14).\n\n285.2 When asked whether it was recorded in his books that Mr T\u00fcrkkan paid cash for professional services rendered by Mr Partellas\u2019 firm, he said:\n\n*\"I\u2019m just telling you what I remember... I\u2019m not saying it was not recorded. I\u2019m saying it was probably the net amount was recorded in our books after we paid Mr. Sarris as well. It is usually how it happens in Cyprus... Sometimes we have cash payments\"* (Tr 924:8-924:22).\n\n285.3 When questioned about the financial records which would show how Mr Partellas (or his firm) had paid Mr Sarris or Prontoservus (a company associated with Mr Sarris\u2019 law firm) for the transfer of Libananco to Mr T\u00fcrkkan, Mr Partellas said: *\"I believe what happened is we paid cash to Mr. Sarris as well, and the difference was recorded in our books as sundry income\"* (Tr 922:20-922:22).\n\n285.4 When asked why this was recorded as *\"sundry income\"* and the nature of the income was not properly recorded, Mr Partellas responded: *\"Because itwas just a cash transaction, that\u2019s why\"* (Tr 923:5-923:6).\n\n285.5 Finally, when questioned by the Respondent\u2019s Counsel: *\"lots of people have cash payments, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t record properly in your books if you \u2019re keeping honest books what it is that you \u2019re being paid, the amount, and what it relates to. Do you dispute that?\",* Mr Partellas responded: *\"No\"* (Tr 925:1-925:7).\n\n286.\n\nMr Partellas was referred to Exhibit H-22, which were Libananco\u2019s 2002 Financial Statements dated on 14 January 2003.\n\n286.1 It was pointed out to him that, on page 12, the administrative expenses for the period ended 31 December 2002 were shown. He agreed that Exhibit H-22 purported to show that Libananco had administrative expenses of US$ 59,050 in 2002 (Tr 986:3-986:6).\n\n286.2 He was asked whether these were actually incurred in 2002. He responded without giving a direct answer to that question:\n\n*\"Yes, but you \u2019re allowed to make a provision in the accounts as well, and that is an expense... The profit and loss, as I explained, also includes provisions. It\u2019s not just actual transactions that happened\"* (Tr 985:21-987:13).\n\n286.3 He explained that: *\"a provision is an expense which has been incurred and will be paid\"* (Tr 988:9-988:10).\n\n286.4 He later accepted that the fee due to his firm recorded in Exhibit H-22 was actually paid. His evidence was that *\"[p]art of this money\"* was paid (Tr 995:14). He said that Mr T\u00fcrkkan paid his firm in cash, but not the full amount stated in Libananco\u2019s accounts: *\"Not the amounts stated, no. Less\"* (Tr 995:15-995:20).\n\n*(d) Why Libananco\u2019s tax returns, financial statements and notice of change of directors was not filed on time*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nAs a preliminary point, Mr Partellas confirmed that, during the material period (i.e. after Libananco was allegedly acquired by Mr T\u00fcrkkan on 1 April 2002), it was mandatory for the tax returns and financial statements of a company to be filed (Tr 902:18-902:21).\n\n287.1 His evidence was the annual accounts had to be filed:\n\n*\"[o]ne year after the end of the previous year\",* and that *\"[t]he tax return is filed together with the accounts up to 2002. After 2003, only the tax return is being [sic] filed within a year from the previous financial year\"* (Tr 909:9-909:19).\n\n287.2 When asked about the late filing of Libananco\u2019s accounts and tax returns, Mr Partellas replied:\n\n*\"Yes, we filed them late, and it is usual to file late accounts in Cyprus. The only effect of late filing of accounts is if there is tax payable, there is a penalty of 10 percent. If there are losses, there is no penalty\"* (Tr 910:17-911:1).\n\n287.3 Specifically, Mr Partellas said that: *\"we filed [the accounts for] 2002, \u20183, and \u20184 in 2007... There was no actual reason. You can delay filing\u2014\"* (Tr 1001:17-1001:22).\n\n287.4 He was asked by the Tribunal whether he was instructed by Mr T\u00fcrkkan not to file Libananco\u2019s accounts on time, to which he responded:\n\n*\"Probably yes, probably yes, but again in the cases of accounts where there are no losses, no profit, there is no penalty incurred at the Tax Office for late filing. It\u2019s only if you have tax payable\"* (Tr 1002:1-1002:7).\n\n287.5 When asked if the 2002 accounts for Libananco should have been filed in 2004 instead, he said: *\"Yes. If you follow the strict letter of the law, yes\".* Counsel for the Respondent then asked if it was indeed his business to ensure that his clients follow the strict letter of the law, to which he responded: *\"We try\"* (Tr 1007:2-1007:9).\n\n287.6 The Tribunal questioned Mr Partellas as to the necessity of preparing audited accounts for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 if the intention was to maintain confidentiality by not filing those accounts. He explained:\n\n*\"It was a request by the shareholder [i.e. Mr Turkkan] at the time secretly... It is true, we could have prepared a management account [sic] for this, but he wanted privacy of account. I don\u2019t know for what reasons, but he wanted accounts, but he didn\u2019t want them to be filed. He told us to wait\"* (Tr 1008:14-1009:7).\n\n287.7 Finally, in re-direct examination, Mr Partellas completed his evidence on this topic by saying that it would not be unusual at all to receive instructions from a managing director or a shareholder to hold off certain filings with the Cypriot government. He said that this was done for other clients as well (Tr 1014:7-1014:18). He also confirmed that it was common practice in Cyprus for a company to delay the filing of its accounts as there would be no tax penalties in the cases where the company suffers losses. He said that this was done for other clients as well, and that other accountants in Cyprus adopted the same practice (Tr 1015:1-1015:16).\n\n287.8 Mr Partellas admitted (although his evidence here was not forthcoming as can be observed from the exchange below) that Cypriot law would have required notification in 2002 of Mr Turkkan's acquisition of Libananco and the accompanying change of directors, but that in fact no notification was made until November 2005.\n\n287.9 His initial evidence was that: *\"There is no time limit\";* when Counsel for the Respondent cited the relevant provision from the Cypriot Companies Act which stipulated that such documents were required to be filed within 14 days of execution, he then said: *\"Okay, but there is a small penalty\".* When asked why he denied that there was such an obligation in the first place, he said: *\"I didn\u2019t deny anything... This is the strict letter of the law, but in practice you can file it later, any changes\"* (Tr 907:7-908:18). When asked whether it was his responsibility as the Company Secretary of Libananco to ensure that documents required to be filed were filed in a timely fashion, he responded: *\"Yes, I agree. We do our best, but sometimes things\u2014sometimes things get delayed\"* (Tr 908:19-909:3).\n\n287.10 Mr Partellas gave evidence to the effect that Mr Turkkan had asked him not to register the transfer of shares to Libananco:\n\n*\"Mr. Turkkan asked us for, afterwards when we met if it was possible not to record the transfer of shares until sometime later on. So, because of this relaxation of the Exchange Controls [referring to the relaxation of regulations in Cyprus following its entry into the European Union], we decided not to ask for the permit at that time\"* (Tr 920:11-920:15).\n\n287.11 When asked what was the reason that Mr T\u00fcrkkan gave for not notifying the Registrar of Companies, in accordance with Cypriot law, that there had been a change of directors of Libananco, he responded:\n\n*\"Because he was also to be appointed as Director and of course as shareholder, and for confidentiality, security reasons, he didn\u2019t want this transfer to be made at the time when the company was purchased. So, as I explained before, we waited for his instructions, and we filed this in November 05\"* (Tr 951:2-951:8).\n\n*(e) Whether the necessary permission was sought from the Cyprus Central Bank to establish Libananco as an offshore holding company*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nMr Partellas was asked to confirm whether the offshore holding company in respect of which Mr T\u00fcrkkan had asked for his help to acquire was an *\"IBC\"* (i.e. International Business Company). Mr Partellas agreed this was correct (Tr 919:14-919:18).\n\n289.\n\nMr Partellas was asked whether, in 2002, it was necessary for a foreigner to obtain permission from the Cyprus Central Bank in order to hold shares in an IBC. His response was that: *\"at that time... it was just... a couple of years before we joined the E.U.... it was a process of relaxation of the Exchange controls in Cyprus\"* (Tr 919:19-920:9).\n\n290.\n\nHowever, in re-direct examination, Mr Partellas clarified that the tax reforms in Cyprus only came into effect on 1 January 2003, and *\"the relaxations permits from the Central Bank also began in late 2003\"* (Tr 1019:18-1019:22).\n\n*(f) Libananco\u2019s minutes and board meetings*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nMr Partellas agreed that he was, as Corporate Secretary of Libananco, responsible *\"for keeping a good record of Board meetings, management meetings, and the meetings of the General Assembly\"* (Tr 910:9-910:13).\n\n292.\n\nMr Partellas was asked, in general terms, about Libananco\u2019s meetings and the accompanying minutes.\n\n292.1 He was asked whether he in fact attended any of the board meetings recorded in Libananco\u2019s minutes. He confirmed that he did not do so: *\"No. The Board Minutes were prepared by the Managing Director who was Mr. Ali Cenk Turkkan... I reviewed the Minutes after they were sent\"* (Tr 959:18-960:3).\n\n292.2 It was put to him that Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was that the board meetings actually took place. He was asked to clarify whether this position was correct. His response was: *\"No, the Board meetings and minutes were prepared by Mr. Turkkan. He was the Managing Director. He was preparing the Minutes, and the two nominees were just signing\"* (Tr 960:19-960:22).\n\n292.3 Mr Partellas confirmed again that the two nominee directors of Libananco did not actually attend any board meetings: *\"they were just nominee directors\"* (Tr 961:1-961:3). He confirmed that Libananco\u2019s corporate documents were sent to the nominee directors, who signed the documents in that capacity (Tr 961:4-961:7).\n\n293.\n\nWith regard to Exhibit H-9, which was an extract from the Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors\u2019 Meeting dated 1 April 2002, Mr Partellas gave the following evidence.\n\n293.1 When asked by the Respondent\u2019s Counsel whether a Board meeting (conducted over the telephone) actually occurred, Mr Partellas did not give an immediate answer:\n\n*\"Well, this is something that we discussed with him at the time, I believe. And the practice was to put everything on paper using this standard format... this Minute is prepared as a matter of routine following transfers of shares and changing Directors\"* (Tr 927:7-927:21).\n\n293.2 He later admitted as follows:\n\n*\"No. Again, I\u2019m explaining that this is something we prepared following changes in Directors and approving the transfer of shares, and it\u2019s prepared by the company Secretary. It doesn\u2019t mean those people were there at the time\"* (Tr 930:2-930:6).\n\nHe therefore agreed that no actual meeting took place over the telephone on 1 April 2002 as recorded in the minutes (i.e. Exhibit H-9) (Tr 930:8-930:16).\n\n294.\n\nMr Partellas was also referred to Exhibit H-ll, which were the Minutes of Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Meeting dated 10 July 2002.\n\n294.1 He observed that, on the second page of Exhibit H-ll, the external auditing advisor of Libananco was recorded to be *\"PARTELLAS KILLIARIS LTD\".* When asked whether this was odd, he replied: *\"Maybe the \"limited.\" Maybe it wasn\u2019t there at the time\"* (Tr 969:18-969:19).\n\n294.2 He testified that he only formed a limited company in 2005 (Tr 969:22).\n\n294.3 When asked for an explanation as to this apparent inconsistency, he replied: *\"Oh, it\u2019s a very simple mistake that anybody can make\".*\n\n**12. Witness Statement of Polakis Sarris dated 22 April 2009**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nDespite his involvement in transferring legal ownership of Libananco from Prontoservus (a company associated with Mr Sarris\u2019 law firm) to Mr T\u00fcrkkan, Mr Sarris\u2019 Witness Statement was reserved.\n\n296.\n\nMr Sarris\u2019 Witness Statement stated:\n\n*\"I have reviewed (i.) resignation letters signed by me, Mrs. E Petsa, and Mrs E. Kyriacou in relation to [Libananco], each dated 1 April 2002; and (ii.) the instrument of transfer of shares in Libananco to Mr. Ali Cenk Turkkan,*  ***signed by me on behalf of Prontoservus Limited on 1 April 2002...***  *I hereby confirm that the documents referred to above... were in fact executed on 1 April 2002\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n297.\n\nHowever, he clarified in direct examination that he did not in fact sign the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002. He said that it was signed instead by his employee Mr Starvos Ktorides (Tr 740:3-740:8).\n\n**13. Cross-examination of Mr Sarris**\n--------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nBy way of background, Mr Sarris began by explaining that Prontoservus was a company owned by him, which was used to incorporate and then sell shelf companies to both local and foreign clients (Tr 741:15-742:3).\n\n299.\n\nThe cross-examination of Mr Sarris covered the following areas:\n\n(a) whether or not he signed the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002;\n\n(b) whether or not his employees ahended Libananco\u2019s board meeting on 1 April 2002;\n\n(c) the manner in which Mr Partellas was billed (if at all) for the sale of Libananco to Mr T\u00fcrkkan through Mr Partellas; and\n\n(d) the requirements under Cypriot law for a change of ownership and/or a change of directors to be with the Registrar of Companies within 14 days.\n\n*(a) Whether Mr Sarris signed the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nMr Sarris was asked to explain his testimony in his Witness Statement that he signed the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002 even though he clarified during direct examination that he did not in fact sign that document (see paragraphs 296 to 297 above).\n\n301.\n\nHe said that he simply did not know why this was the case: *\"I don\u2019t know really. I was surprised when I read it to come here, and I said, how did I sign this thing? Maybe I didn\u2019t notice it. I don\u2019t know\"* (Tr 770:19-770:22).\n\n302.\n\nHe was then asked about whether he had any specific recollection, independent of the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002, of when Prontoservus transferred Libananco to Mr T\u00fcrkkan (through Mr Partellas).\n\n302.1 He said that he did not, and explained that he knew that the transfer took place on 1 April 2002 only by looking at the Instrument of Transfer which bore that date: *\"No, but it\u2019s the dates which appear on the documents\"* (Tr 771:18-771:19). He therefore confirmed that his evidence was based entirely on the fact of the document (i.e. the Instrument of Transfer) bearing that date (Tr 771:21-772:1).\n\n302.2 When he was asked if he could otherwise recall the date on which the Instrument of Transfer was executed, he said he was unable to: *\"No, not the actual date, no, but I rely on the date of the document\"* (Tr 772:6-772:7).\n\n302.3 He explained that his evidence was based on a presumption that the Instrument of Transfer was signed on the date that it bore:\n\n*\"I have* 7, *000 companies. All the documents, they have certain dates. Do you expect me to remember whether every day shown on every document is the actual date signed? Of course we presume that this is the date signed\"* (Tr 775:15-775:19).\n\n302.4 Mr Sarris also said that he never received a copy of the Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002 that was signed by Mr T\u00fcrkkan, the purchaser of Libananco (Tr 780:16-780:20). He explained that:\n\n*\"For this particular case, because I\u2014it was selling the company to a firm of accountants, who were supposed to take over to have it executed by the transferee, and then keep it in their files, and then submit it to the reserve companies or whatever they think proper. But in our case when we set up companies and the client wants to keep anonymity, we used to give him the Instrument of Transfer undated for his own security...\"* (Tr 781:7-781:16).\n\n*(b) Whether Mr Sarris\u2019 employees attended Libananco\u2019s board meeting on 1 April 2002*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nMr Sarris was referred to Exhibit H-9, which was an extract of the Minutes of the Libananco Board of Directors' Meeting dated 1 April 2002. This stated that the following of his or his firm\u2019s employees were *\"[p]resent\"* at that meeting: Mrs Eleni Kyriakou, Mrs Iro Petsa, Mr Andreas Partellas and Ms Antonia Kyriakou.\n\n303.1 Contrary to what appears to have been recorded in Exhibit H-9, he confirmed that he and his employees did not abend any such meeting (Tr 777:19-777:20).\n\n303.2 He explained:\n\n*\"We never have actual Board meetings. We draft the Minute, and we give it to the people, and they sign it. We don\u2019t go in the actual meeting having a coffee and meet, you know, for business. We just start it on the computer\"* (Tr 777:22-778:5).\n\n*(c) The manner in which Mr Partellas \u2019firm was invoiced (if at all) for the sale of Libananco and the documents evidencing such a transaction*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nMr Sarris\u2019 said that Mr Partellas would have been the person to bill for his services, and his firm therefore invoiced Mr Partellas for the services rendered (Tr 760:14-760:17).\n\n304.1 When asked whether his records would show an invoice to Mr Partellas, he replied:\n\n*\"Supposed to... I don\u2019t know. I was never involved, and I\u2019m never involved in the accounting in this process, but with Mr. Partellas who had ongoing relationship with his companies, we must have sold him about 15 companies, but maybe he had a current account with the office. I don\u2019t know\"* (Tr 760:20-761:11).\n\n304.2 It was put to Mr Partellas that if the mahers alleged by the Claimant were to be true (i.e. the transfer of Libananco on 1 April 2002 to Mr Turkkan), then there would have been an invoice in 2002 reflecting this. He answered: *\"There should be, yes\"* (Tr 761:13-761:17). He also confirmed that the books of his firm would have recorded such a transaction (Tr 763:21-764:2).\n\n304.3 It was suggested to Mr Sarris that if one were interested in determining whether or not the alleged transaction (i.e. the sale and purchase of Libananco) in fact took place in 2002, then the easiest way to find out would be to look at the records of his firm to see if such a transaction was in fact recorded on its books. He replied: *\"Look, I have my own auditors for my accounts, and they do the accounting and the audit, so all the books are available because either way you\u2019re checking\"* (Tr 763:9-763:19).\n\n304.4 Towards the end of his cross-examination, he appeared to change his evidence to say that the invoice relating to the transaction in question (i.e. the sale and purchase of Libananco) would not necessarily be in his firm\u2019s files:\n\n*\"Not necessarily, and I will tell you why. Because with Mr. Partellas, we had an ongoing cooperation... We never had an invoice until we sell the company, and by selling the company to Mr. Partellas, maybe there was\u2014I don\u2019t know if there was an invoice. Maybe there is. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember, but Mr. Partellas had a current account with the office. I told you. He already start [sic] about 15 companies\"* (Tr 783:4-783:16).\n\n304.5 However, he clarified that, even if he did not have an invoice relating to this particular transaction, he might still have had an invoice relating to multiple sales which would reflect this particular transaction (Tr 783:17-784:4).\n\n305.\n\nSignificantly, Mr Sarris said that he had not looked in his files prior to giving evidence in this arbitration to find the relevant financial records establishing when the sale and purchased of Libananco took place. He said: *\"Nobody asked me about that\"* (Tr 784:5-784:9).\n\n305.1 He was asked whether he knew that it was in issue in these proceedings whether Mr Turkkan in fact purchased Libananco in April 2002. He said:\n\n*\"Believe me, when they asked me to come here, I didn\u2019t know anything about what is a dispute or what is the subject matter. They told me here in Washington that I asked few questions [sic], and they told me what is the dispute [sic]. I didn\u2019t know anything\"* (Tr 784:11-784:20).\n\n305.2 Importantly, he confirmed that no one had asked him (prior to his coming to give evidence in this arbitration) to produce the financial records or to investigate the financial records of his firm to establish that the sale and purchase of Libananco to Mr Turkkan had in fact taken place in April 2002: *\"Nobody asked me to provide it.... You should have asked me, and I could try to find it\"* (Tr 784:22-786:15).\n\n*(d) The requirements under Cypriot law for a change of ownership and/or directors to be registered with the Registrar of Companies within 14 days*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nMr Sarris confirmed that, under Cypriot law, a change of ownership would have to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (Tr 748:12-748:18). However, he clarified that:\n\n*\"that doesn\u2019t mean that according to the law we had to do it immediately. It may wait months or years, unless we wanted [sic] Certificate from the Registrar of Companies evidencing and showing the actual shareholder, give the client the Shareholder Certificates. We are waiting for some\"* (Tr 749:12-749:18).\n\n307.\n\nHe further confirmed that Cypriot law would require the registration, with the Registrar of Companies, of a change of directors by means of form *\"HE-4\"* which would have to be filed within *\"14 days\"* (Tr 750:10-750:22).\n\n307.1 However, he qualified his answer:\n\n*\"Let me explain. This is when the handling of the whole matter is made by our office. I mean, if you come as a client and you want to buy a company and you want your name to appear as a Director or the shareholder and we continue to be the Secretary because it\u2019s the Secretary who is responsible to do all this, then, yes, it was our office. But when we used to sell companies to auditors or accountants, and they were taking over, we were just giving them our resignations, and they were taking over all the formalities with the registered companies\"* (Tr 751:3-751:14).\n\n307.2 His evidence was therefore that, although form *\"HE-4\"* normally had to be filed within 14 days of a change of the directors of the company, and that his firm would usually take responsibility for this filing, this was not so in the present case since Libananco was sold to a firm of accountants (i.e. Mr Partellas\u2019 firm, with the ultimate buyer being Mr Turkkan): *\"No, in our office we never delay this. But as I told you, when we give it to an accountant firm that we used to incorporate, it\u2019s them who take over all these formalities\"* (Tr 753:18-753:21).\n\n307.3 He explained that, once responsibility for complying with these formalities had been passed onto Mr Partellas\u2019 firm, he did not follow up further on the maher:\n\n*\"I give them the resignations of my Directors, I give them the Instrument of Transfer of these shares and to the name they tell me is the new shareholder, and they take over. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t follow up and check whether they filed any Applications to... because we trust each other\"* (Tr 754:8-754:16).\n\n307.4 He confirmed that he trusted Mr Partellas\u2019 firm to follow up on the necessary legal formalities:\n\n*\"Well, they always do. We never had for 30 years doing this business any incident that, you know, our Directors are still showing after five years, for example, the company was, et cetera. We always had it... as far as we are concerned, on the 1st of April of2002, we, our Directors have resigned\"* (Tr 754:20-755:14).\n\nHowever, Mr Partellas\u2019 evidence is that the relevant notifications or registrations in this regard were only made in 2005 (Tr 957:3-957:6).\n\n**14. Witness Statement of Saylan \u00c7i\u011fgin dated 24 April 2009**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nBy way of background, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin deposed that he began working for Star T.V. A.S. in 1993, and became the head of its legal department in 2000. Star T.V. A.S. was part of the Star Media Group, a group of companies owned by Cem Uzan. He explained that:\n\n*\"In addition to my primary role within the Star Media Group, I also advised Mr. Cem Uzan on certain other legal issues. Accordingly, I* *was familiar with at least some of the legal issues that arose in connection with [\u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez] which were Mr. Cem Uzan\u2019s other major businesses beyond the Star Media Group\".*\n\nHe deposed that he provided legal advice to Cem Uzan on certain regulatory issues regarding \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s dispute with the Ministry over the proposed transfer of the companies\u2019 transmission lines to the Turkish Government.\n\n309.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin explained how he came to be involved in the present case as follows:\n\n*\"...in keeping with my role as his legal advisor on certain Utilities issues, in September 2002, Mr. Cem Uzan informed me that members of his immediate family would be transferring ownership of a substantial number of their bearer shares in the Utilities to Libananco...*\n\n*At the time he informed me of the planned transfer, Mr. Cem Uzan also informed me that Mr. Cenk Turkkan, a trusted business manager for Mr. Cem Uzan, and the nominal owner and General Manager of Libananco, would oversee the administrative details of the transfer. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Turkkan asked me to become a legal advisor to Libananco and I agreed to do so\".*\n\n310.\n\nThe evidence in Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's Witness Statement fell into the following broad categories:\n\n(a) how he was asked by Cem Uzan to prepare template STAs for use in connection with Libananco\u2019s acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez; and\n\n(b) his role in accepting delivery of share certificates on behalf of Libananco in istanbul, Turkey.\n\n*(a) Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's preparation of template STAs*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nHe deposed that he was asked by Cem Uzan to prepare model or template STAs for use in connection with Libananco\u2019s acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez:\n\n*\"Mr. Cem Uzan had also requested that I prepare a model share transfer agreement for use by Mr. Turkkan in connection with the planned transfer of bearer shares to Libananco. I prepared a model of such an agreement for use by Mr Turkkan. The model STA was sent to Mr. Turkkan by electronic mail. I was not present at the signing of any of the agreements. My role was simply to create the template for the transactions and to advise Mr. Cem Uzan and Libananco on Turkish legal issues surrounding the transfer\".*\n\n312.\n\nHe then elaborated as to his understanding of the legal significance (or lack of) of the STAs under Turkish law:\n\n*\"In particular, I advised Mr. Cem Uzan in or around September 2002 that under Turkish law, it is not necessary to create a written record of a bearer share transfer.*  ***To the contrary, ownership of such bearer shares is basically transferred via an intent to transfer and the transfer of possession to the buyer or \"teslim\" - literally \"handover\" in English.***  *I also recall that around that same time, Mr. Cem Uzan asked me about Turkish legal and regulatory requirements possibly affecting the Utilities\u2019 bearer share transfers. I advised him that, while there would be certain regulatory reporting requirements, a failure to report at the time of the transfer would not affect the legal validity of the transfer under Turkish law, which was his primary concern at that time.*\n\n*In view of my advice to Mr. Cem Uzan on this matter, it was my understanding that,*  ***as share transfer agreements were not strictly necessary to accomplish the planned transfer,***  *the model agreement I had prepared was only going to be used to provide written evidence of each family member\u2019s intention and consent to transfer their bearer shares to Libananco. Thus, I prepared the model agreement using generic terms for a transfer,*  ***such as referring to cash being paid in return for the shares\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*(b) Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s alleged role in accepting delivery of the share certificates in Istanbul*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe next area of Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence relates to the alleged delivery of the shares certificates to Libananco or *teslim -* specifically, his alleged role in accepting delivery of those share certificates on behalf of Libananco.\n\n314.\n\nHis evidence in relation to the alleged acts of *teslim* was as follows:\n\n*\"Again, sometime in late April or early May 2003, Mr. Turkkan called me and asked me to go, on behalf of Libananco, to the Rumeli and Dogus buildings in Mecidiyekoy, istanbul, where he informed me that the bearer shares in the Utilities being transferred to Libananco by the Uzan family were held in secure areas.*  ***Mr. Turkkan further instructed me to physically examine those bearer shares and to ensure that they were being stored for the benefit of Libananco.***  *In turn, I understood that my*  ***physical examination and acceptance of the shares on behalf of Libananco would constitute \"teslim\"***  *which, as I already mentioned, was the necessary requirement for the transfer of ownership of the bearer shares to Libananco to be perfected under Turkish law.*\n\n*... I arrived at \u00c7EA\u015e' office on*  ***15 May 2003***  *and proceeded to the secure storage area in the Rumeli Building, opened the locked door with a key provided to me by Mr. Bal [one of the directors of \u00c7EA\u015e] and conducted my inspection of the bearer share certificates. Thereafter, I went to the Dogus building and conducted a similar inspection of the bearer share certificates that were stored there.*\n\n***In each building, the bearer share certificates were wrapped in brown paper packaging and piled in stacks. Each of the individual packages of certificates was hand-labeled with the word \"Libananco,\"***  *and most of them also had the number and nominal value of the certificates that they contained noted thereon. Although I did not count each share (which would have been impracticable given their large number - there were many thousands of certificates), I did open all of the packages to verify that they in fact contained \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez bearer share certificates. At the same time, I also compared the labeling on the brown paper packaging enclosing the certificates with an*  ***inventory of share transfers, which indicated the type of shares being transferred, their quantity, and their nominal value,***  *to ensure that the bearer shares intended to be transferred were indeed present and accounted for. Unfortunately, as it was only a checklist sent to me for my own use,*  ***I did not retain a copy of it***  *once I had verified that the share certificates were being properly and securely stored for Libananco.*\n\n*After I inspected Libananco\u2019s bearer share certificates, I called Mr. Turkkan on the phone to report that*  ***I had inspected the shares and confirmed delivery to, and my acceptance of them on behalf of, Libananco.***  *I also reported this inspection and acceptance process to Mr. Cem Uzan\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n315.\n\nHe also gave evidence as to what happened to those share certificates after his alleged inspection:\n\n***\"Shortly after my inspection of the bearer share certificates, I learned from Mr. Cem Uzan that a large number of the shares that I had inspected had been moved from the premises where I inspected them to other secure locations.***  *However, I know that not all of the share certificates were moved from the Rumeli and Dogus buildings at that time. I know this because several days after I heard from Mr. Cem Uzan that some of the shares had been moved, I received two share custody invoices executed by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez, respectively, which indicated that share certificates representing approximately 14 to 16% of the capital value of the Utilities continued to be stored at the Utilities\u2019 offices in Mecidiyekoy. As far as I can recall, Mr. Bal brought the originals of these share custody invoices to me. After reviewing them, I sent a copy of the share custody invoices to Mr. Turkkan in Jordan, and I gave the originals to Mr. Cem Uzan\u2019s office.*\n\n*I assume that these originals were delivered to Mr. Cem Uzan. However, since his office was seized by the Turkish Government in February of 2004, all documents, personal possessions and other things were removed by Government agents.*\n\n*In February 2004, the Turkish Government also seized the Rumeli and Dogus buildings, including those areas where Utilities\u2019 shares referred to in the share custody invoices had been stored and held for Libananco. The Government remains in possession of those buildings up to today\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n**15. Cross-examination of Mr** \u00c7i\u011fgin\n--------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin gave evidence in relation to the following material topics or areas:\n\n(a) the circumstances surrounding his retainer by Libananco as its legal advisor;\n\n(b) his role in the preparation of the template STA, in particular his understanding of what legal role the STAs would come to play in relation to Libananco\u2019s alleged acquisition of shares;\n\n(c) his central role in allegedly achieving *teslim* in respect of share certificates representing approximately 50 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez respectively;\n\n(d) the non-disclosure by Libananco, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez of Libananco\u2019s alleged acquisition of the majority interests in the latter two companies, even though this was required by the Turkish Capital Market Law No. 2499 (specifically, its subordinate legislation); and\n\n(e) his role in representing Cem Uzan before the Danistay in proceedings brought by \u00c7EA\u015e challenging the cancellation of its Concession Agreement.\n\n*(a) Mr* *\u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s role as Libananco\u2019s legal adviser*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin testified that his involvement with Libananco ceased in May 2003: *\"In May 2003, after the completion of the handover [of the bearer shares to Libananco] and once I received the receipts and passed them on to Cem Uzan, I took no legal steps\"* (Tr 532:17-532:21).\n\n318.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin was referred to Exhibit H-13, which were Libananco\u2019s Minutes of Directors\u2019 Meeting dated 23 September 2002. The first page of those minutes recorded, among other things, that: *\"1- It is proposed and agreed to Appoint Mr. Ali Betar, as company internal legal advisor; 2- It is proposed and agreed to Appoint Mr. Saylan (\u00c7i\u011fgin, as company internal legal advisor\".*\n\n318.1 However, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin said that he was not aware that he was required to provide such a service, and that nobody had ever told him of such an appointment: *\"No, I was never requested [sic] such a service\"* (Tr 560:18-561:11).\n\n318.2 Further, he also confirmed that he did not know Mr Betar (Tr 560:5-560:6).\n\n319.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin confirmed that he did not have any notes or records of any advice that he gave to Libananco. He also agreed that he did not have any e-mail messages or letters documenting his involvement with the present case (Tr 538:22-539:14).\n\n*(b) Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s role in preparing the model agreement or template STA*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin confirmed that he prepared the template STA in September 2002 (see paragraph 311 above; Tr 579:4-579:7). He was asked by the Respondent\u2019s Counsel why the metadata associated with the STAs were dated from April 2002, when his evidence was that he first prepared the template STA around September 2002. He was unable to explain why this was the case (Tr 580:7-580:11) but added that he *\"had a previous draft, and it could have been used by others\"* (Tr 581:7-581:13). However, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s own evidence was that he provided Mr Turkkan with a template STA only in or after September 2002, when he was first informed of Libananco\u2019s intended acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n321.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin was referred, as an example, to Exhibit H-16, which was an STA relating to Kepez shares. It was stated on the STAs that:\n\n*\"The Transferee, has sold, transferred and assigned all rights, benefits, including the user fruct Rights of the below detailed shares, to the Buyer and has received the sale and transfer proceeds*  ***in cash***  *and in advance\"* (emphasis added).\n\n321.1 He was asked to confirm whether it was his understanding that consideration for the transfer of the shares to the purchaser would be given in the form of cash. He said: *\"No... I was not given any details about the payments\"* (Tr 583:13-583:19).\n\n321.2 When asked to explain why then he had drafted a template STA which purported to show that cash had changed hands, he said:\n\n*\"Because this was a general draft in the true sense of the word. It is a kind of draft you would use in the general practices of the companies. That\u2019s exactly why I prepared the draft in that manner. Anybody could have easily changed this draft in any way they pleased, so anybody could simply say delete the part about cash payment and put in payment installments or whatever they please... this is a draft that was used generally by the companies in their implementations. I prepared* *this for that purpose, and anyone would have been welcome to amend it in any way they pleased\"* (Tr 584:6-585:17).\n\n321.3 He elaborated further:\n\n*\"Cem Uzan simply asked me to prepare a model that Turkkan can use during these transactions. He asked me to prepare a model contract. He did not\u2014I wasn\u2019t given any detailed information as you suggest. Therefore, these agreements are mere drafts that contain very general phrases\"* (Tr 586:18-586:22).\n\n322.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin was asked about his understanding of what the STAs (which were based on the model agreement drafted by him) were intended to achieve, i.e. whether they were intended to achieve a share transfer and assignment, or whether they were merely to evidence the intention to transfer shares.\n\n322.1 He said:\n\n*\"it was not mandatory to have written documents in order for the transaction to be valid. If a document or rather if an agreement were prepared, it would have constituted written evidence of the intent of the Parties\"* (Tr 588:12-588:17).\n\n322.2 However, he agreed that the model agreement that he allegedly drafted purported on its face to be a document intended to be used as a *\"Share Sale Transfer and Assignment of Rights Agreement\"* as such (as opposed to merely a memorialisation of intent) (Tr 588:18-589:2).\n\n322.3 Notwithstanding the above, he said that, when he drafted or prepared the template STA in 2002, it was only intended to be used as a means to memorialise an intent to transfer shares (and therefore would not be the actual sale and purchase agreement as such). He further understood that he would be involved in the process of achieving *teslim* in respect of the share certificates to be transferred to Libananco (Tr 727:7-727:14).\n\n322.4 Mr\u00a0\u00c7i\u011fgin testified that, in September 2002, he specifically advised Cem Uzan on *\"how to transfer shares according to the Turkish Commercial Code\"* (Tr 801:13-801:20), and that Cem Uzan (at the time):\n\n*\"asked[him] whether it\u2019s really necessary to make such an agreement, whether a written agreement is completely compulsory, and probably [he] gave [his] advice to this effect when [Cem Uzan] asked [him] those question [sic]\"* (Tr 802:15-802:20).\n\n322.5 However, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s later evidence was to the effect that Cem Uzan gave him no instructions either way (i.e. whether the template was to be used as an instrument to execute the actual transfer of ownership of the shares or whether its purpose was merely to memorialise the intent to transfer shares): *\"[Cem Uzan] only asked me to prepare a model Transfer* *Agreement. He never said that he was going to use it for the transfer of shares. I never heard him say that\"* (Tr 804:22-805:3).\n\n323.\n\nIn relation to the issue of the dividends payable to shareholders of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin agreed that the STAs were drafted on the premise that the shares were going to be transferred with all rights and benefits attached, including the right to receive those dividends (Tr 593:11-593:18). He agreed that Libananco as the transferee of the shares would be entitled to assume, based on the manner in which the STAs were drafted, that it was going to receive full title to the shares as well as the right to receive the corresponding dividends (Tr 594:7-594:13).\n\n*(c) Mr* *\u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s alleged role in accepting delivery or accomplishing teslim in respect of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin said that he confirmed delivery of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates amounting to approximately 50 per cent of the total share capital of each of those companies (Tr 561:20-562:7) on 15 May 2003 (Tr 715:1-715:4). Although Libananco claims ownership of approximately 65 per cent and 60 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez respectively, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence was that he had no knowledge of how **teslim** was achieved in respect of the balance of the shares (Tr 716:3-716:6). His evidence was therefore concerned only with the **teslim** that was allegedly accomplished on 15 May 2003.\n\n324.1 In that regard, he confirmed that in May 2003 he had no knowledge that any STAs had been executed purporting to transfer shares to Libananco (Tr 730:2-730:4).\n\n324.2 His evidence was that the basis on which he was going to accomplish *teslim* was by means of the:\n\n*\"list Ali Cenk Turkkan sent me. In that list or in our conversations, there were no details to the effect that the agreements had been executed. I was simply told we will do a teslim, here are the documents, go do it. There were no details about the agreements\"* (Tr 730:8-730:13).\n\n325.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin was referred to Exhibit H-61, which was Libananco\u2019s Share Acquisition Report as of 20 May 2003. He agreed that Exhibit H-61 showed that all of the Kepez shares allegedly owned by Libananco had been purchased before 15 May 2003 (Tr 717:3-717:11). He agreed that his evidence (i.e. that *teslim* was accomplished in respect of approximately 50 per cent of Kepez shares on 15 May 2003 itself) was inconsistent with what was shown on the face of Exhibit H-61 (Tr 718:10-718:16).\n\n326.\n\nIn relation to the issue of the actual inspection of the share certificates, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin gave the following evidence.\n\n326.1 He was asked to explain his evidence in his Witness Statement in which he deposed that he was asked by Mr Turkkan to ensure that the share certificates located in istanbul were *\"being stored for the benefit of Libananco\".* He said that the share certificates were kept in the offices of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in Mecidiyekoy, istanbul (Tr 809:21-809:22). However, he did not know who was responsible for the storage of those share certificates:\n\n*\"I don\u2019t know who was responsible because nobody gave me any information about that. When I talked to Mr. Turkkan, he only told me where these shares were, and he said I could go examine and see them where they were... Mr. Turkkan or anybody else did not give me information as to who was responsible for keeping those shares, where they were kept\"* (Tr 810:5-810:13).\n\n326.2 He was referred to Exhibit H-52, which were the Minutes of Libananco\u2019s Management Committee Meeting dated 18 April 2003. It was recorded in that document that:\n\n*\"It is agreed to continue the storage of the actual shares safely in the storage facilities of the Seller until such time as Libananco and the Management Committee decides [sic] to undertake other steps to locate and store the actual shares in an other [sic] location. It is agreed that Mr (\u00c7i\u011fgin, appoint a two lawyer team to go to site of the storage facilities,*  ***and actually physically recheck the storage of the shares, and the labeling [sic] of the storage under the name of Libananco. And to do this on a routine basis (once a month)\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin confirmed that, in his telephone conversation with Mr Turkkan in early 2003, Mr Turkkan: *\"also told me that the Share Certificates needed [sic] be checked at least once a month as long as they were stored in that facility\"* (Tr 812:18-812:21). When asked by the Tribunal whether he specifically told Selahattin Bal that he was at the Rumeli Building to take over the share certificates on behalf of Libananco, he replied: *\"No...* *I can\u2019t really recall whether I used that term specifically when I was speaking to Mr. Bal\"* (Tr 883:5-883:7).\n\n326.3 He confirmed that he did not keep any record of the share certificates which he allegedly inspected in istanbul on 15 May 2003 (Tr 813:19-813:22). He said he did not know (and did not otherwise have any record of) the serial numbers of the share certificates which he allegedly inspected (Tr 829:4-829:8). His evidence was that the process was: *\"not documented other than what I spoke of\u2019* (Tr 833:21-833:22).\n\n326.4 In his Witness Statement, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin deposed that he *\"arrived at ('\u00c7EA\u015e' office on 15 May 2003 and proceeded to the secure storage area in the Rumeli building\".* He changed his evidence in cross-examination when it was suggested to him that there were in fact no \u00c7EA\u015e offices in the Rumeli building: *\"In the Rumeli Building, I went to the secure area where the Share Certificates were stored. I didn\u2019t go to \u00c7EA\u015e's [sic] offices in that building\"* (Tr 816:8-816:11).\n\n326.5 Also in his Witness Statement, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin deposed that, when he arrived at the Rumeli Building, he: *\"opened the locked door with a key provided to me by Mr. Bal [one of the directors of \u00c7EA\u015e]\"*. Again, when it was suggested to him that the share certificates were being stored by Adabank (and therefore not \u00c7EA\u015e), he changed his evidence:\n\n*\"Let me make a correction there, too. Selahattin Bal did not give me a key. He didn\u2019t give me a key, and he just set me free to go around in the building... We opened the door with him, so I was with him at the time\"* (Tr 817:5-817:20).\n\n326.6 When asked to explain why he did not correct these errors in his Witness Statement earlier, he said that he intended to make corrections to his Witness Statement if he was asked a question about something which required correction (Tr 818:5-818:12).\n\n326.7 There were no representatives of Kemal Uzan or Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan in their capacity as the sellers of the shares (Tr 821:14-821:19): *\"Cenk Turkkan had given me the information that the family had already completed the teslim procedures to Libananco, so I did not really think that the sellers had to be there\"* (Tr 822:2-822:5).\n\n326.8 He accordingly explained that, since the representatives of the sellers were absent (or that none were required in any event), the handover process or *teslim* was achieved in the following manner:\n\n*\"... in that area, the Certificates were already present and ready... for Libananco. So, there were packages with Libananco labels on them, and they were prepared, and I had received a list from Mr. Turkkan, and everything corresponded to that list\"* (Tr 823:3-823:13).\n\n326.9 When asked how many share certificates were present in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings, he said: *\"I didn\u2019t count them. As I said, they were in packages, and there were many of them. I can\u2019t remember exactly how* *many\" (Tr* 824:13-824:15).\n\n326.10 When asked whether he knew who had labelled the individual packages of share certificates with the word \"Libananco\", he said: *\"I don\u2019t know, and I had already told you, that I don\u2019t know who had done this, who had prepared these\"* (Tr 828:8-828:10).\n\n326.11 When asked how long the alleged inspection on 15 May 2003 lasted, he replied: *\"Hours. I can tell you that I went there in the morning at around 10:00 a.m., and I must have left in [sic] late afternoon, maybe 5:00, 6:00p.m.\"* (Tr 827:19-827:21).\n\n326.12 His evidence was that he did not retain a copy of the inventory of share certificates (see paragraph 314 above). When questioned by the Tribunal about this, he testified that he made a conscious decision to destroy the latter:\n\n*\"Cem Uzan didn\u2019t want a lot of people to know about the Share Certificate transfer procedures, as I didn\u2019t want to keep them in my office because I was preparing\u2014I was working in a very crowded office, and we didn\u2019t have safes and lockers and all the shelves and the cabinets were accessible to everyone, including the secretaries, and I didn\u2019t want anybody to see those documents, so... I destroyed that document\"* (Tr 864:19-865:6).\n\n326.13 He was referred to Exhibit H-60, which were the share custody invoices dated 16 May 2003, purportedly issued by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez respectively, which indicated that share certificates representing approximately 15.82 per cent and 13.9 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez respectively continued to be stored in their offices in Mecidiyekoy, istanbul on behalf of Libananco. It was suggested to Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin that the place of storage of the share certificates Exhibit H-60 purported to show was wrong.9 He explained:\n\n*\"As a lawyer, it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to confirm the truthfulness of this information. It was up to the person who prepared the document...* *I didn\u2019t feel the need to verify the contents of these documents, and nobody asked me to do this. I wasn\u2019t asked to do this. It wasn\u2019t my responsibility\"* (Tr 836:1-836:19).\n\n326.14 Also on the subject of Exhibit H-60, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was asked how it was possible that, between his alleged inspection on 15 May 2003 and the time the share custody invoices were allegedly prepared on 16 May 2003, bearer share certificates adding up to more than 45 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez respectively (some 50,000 share certificates) were moved out of the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings, with the remaining share certificates being counted within that short space of time (the share custody invoices were specific and stated that share certificates adding up to 13.90904 per cent and 15.81972 per cent of the total share capital of Kepez and \u00c7EA\u015e respectively were being kept in the Rumeli Building in istanbul on behalf of Libananco). His explanation for this apparent feat was as follows:\n\n*\"I can\u2019t comment on what others may have done. However, I can tell you that you don\u2019t need to do a very thorough analysis in that although the packages had information about the number of shares based on nominal value. So, if you added these packages, you could easily* *understand to what percentage of the capital the shares corresponded to\"* (Tr 842:12-842:19).\n\nThe share custody invoices allegedly issued by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez refer only to share certificates being stored in the Rumeli Buidling, but not in the Bogus Building. Further, some of the share custody invoices referred to share certificates being stored on the eighth floor of the Rumeli Building but the Respondent alleged that neither \u00c7EA\u015e nor Kepez had offices on that floor.\n\n*(d) Non-disclosure of Libananco\u2019s alleged acquisition of a majority interest in both \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin was referred to Exhibit H-343, which was an excerpt of the Capital Markets Board Communique - Public Disclosure of Material Events, Serial No. VIII No. 20, published in Official Gazehe No. 21629 on 6 July 1993. This was subordinate legislation under the Turkish Capital Market Law Number 2499.\n\n327.1 His evidence was that he *\"must have looked at it\"* when he advised Libananco (Tr 640:10-640:15).\n\n327.2 He confirmed that the effect of the subordinate legislation was that, if Libananco (or anyone else) were to acquire 10 per cent or more of the total share capital of either \u00c7EA\u015e or Kepez, that fact would have to be disclosed (Tr 641:12-641:16).\n\n327.3 When asked who was responsible for making public disclosure, he referred to Exhibit H-327, which was an excerpt of Capital Markets Law No. 2499, published in Official Gazehe No. 17416 on 30 July 1981. He answered: *\"It\u2019s the members of the Board of Directors, General Manager, Assistant General Managers, and the shareholders holding 10 percent or more of the capital\"* (Tr 642:7-642:10). He further agreed that in the case of a discrepancy or non-disclosure, a monetary fine would be imposed (Tr 642:17-642:22).\n\n327.4 He agreed that, as far as he knew,: *\"no notification was made at any stage to any of the Turkish authorities of Libananco\u2019s alleged shareholding\"* (Tr 672:10-672:13).\n\n327.5 He also agreed that the directors of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez (upon whom the obligation of disclosure fell) would owe duties to act in the best interests of the companies, and the interest of the companies and their shareholders as a whole would have been different from the interests of the Uzans (Tr 644:3-644:11).\n\n327.6 When asked whether there could have been any conceivable reason for anybody to flout the law in that manner, he said: *\"Well, for all we know, those people may have their own justification. I do not know... No, there isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. No\"* (Tr 647:16-648:3).\n\n*(e) Mr* *\u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s role in representing Cem Uzan in proceedings brought by \u00c7EA\u015e before the Danistay*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin was cross-examined on \u00c7EA\u015e\u2019 claim before the Danistay, where the cancellation of the Concession Agreement held by \u00c7EA\u015e was challenged.\n\n328.1 He agreed that \u00c7EA\u015e' case before the Danistay was that it was entirely a Turkish company (i.e. there were no foreign shareholders) (Tr 670:21-671:2).\n\n328.2 He confirmed that he acted on behalf of Cem Uzan in those proceedings, who sought to be joined as an intervener (Tr 671:3-671:6).\n\n328.3 Although by that time (i.e. by the time the challenge before the Danistay was brought by \u00c7EA\u015e). Libananco had allegedly completed its acquisition of \u00c7EA\u015e shares, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin said that he took no steps to correct what was argued by \u00c7EA\u015e before the Danistay (i.e. that it was domestically owned) (Tr 671:7-671:11).\n\n328.4 In that regard, he confirmed that the statements made by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in the Turkish courts were inconsistent with any suggestion of Libananco being the majority shareholder of the latter companies (Tr 672:15-672:22).\n\n**16. Witness Statement of Aysegul Akay Uzan dated 28 April 2009**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nMs Uzan was unable to testily in person at the hearing owing to an alleged illness. On 4 December 2009, the Claimant submitted a letter from a psychiatrist Dr M Ozhan Pektas dated 3 December 2009 (\"Medical Report\"), the subject of which was the medical condition of Ms Uzan. According to the Medical Report, Dr Pektas has known Ms Uzan since 12 September 2002.\n\n330.\n\nHaving considered the contents of the Medical Report, which the Tribunal regards as being medical-in-confidence (and therefore neither necessary nor desirable to recite or otherwise reproduce), the Tribunal concludes as follows.\n\n(a) It was possible that Ms Uzan was under heavy medication and not in a stable mental state at the time she allegedly signed the STAs.\n\n(b) It is uncertain whether Ms Uzan signed her Witness Statement with full knowledge of its contents.\n\n331.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls paragraph 14 of its Procedural Order of 18 December 2009, where it decided as follows:\n\n*\"Having considered the Parties\u2019 positions and the medical certificate provided by the Claimant, the Tribunal decides to disregard Mrs. [sic] Uzan\u2019s written statement from the Record pursuant to Article 4.8 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration\".*\n\n332.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal affirms its decision to disregard Ms Uzan\u2019s Witness Statement; and also heavily discounts her signature on the STAs in the absence of countervailing evidence that she was of sufficient mental capacity and/or in a stable mental state at the respective material times.\n\n**17. Witness Statements of Faruk Ulusoy dated 24 June 2009 and 8 January 2010**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nMr Ulusoy was the Claimant\u2019s witness who did not testify at the hearing for fear of reprisal. The evidence given in his Witness Statement is key in respect of the *teslim* that was allegedly achieved on 15 May 2003 by Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's alleged inspection of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates, which were said to have been wrapped in brown paper and labelled \"Libananco\".\n\n334.\n\nMr Ulusoy deposed, among other things, as follows.\n\n334.1 On 23 March 2004 (whilst he was an employee of Adabank - the agent bank responsible for the processing and payment of dividends to shareholders of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez), he was summoned by personnel from the SDIF. As a result, he went to the basement of the Rumeli Building with SDIF personnel and police officers.\n\n334.2 At that time, he knew that this was where the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates were kept. This is because, since 1998, he was (as an employee of Adabank) in charge of the distribution of dividends for share certificates.\n\n334.3 When (on 23 March 2004) he was in the basement of the Rumeli Building, he saw *\"\u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez stock certificates... wrapped in brown packing paper and were in bundles\".*\n\n334.4 His evidence was that:\n\n*\"We looked at the contents of the bundles by opening this packing paper... Furthermore, I remember that there was a name of a foreigner written on the brown packing paper that the bundles of stock certificates were wrapped in\".*\n\n335.\n\nTaking Article 4(7)10 of the IBA Rules of Taking Evidence in International Arbitration (2010 version) as a guideline, the Tribunal (in the absence of exceptional circumstances) accords no weight to Mr Ulusoy\u2019s statement as he did not testily at the hearing. However, as three of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses (Enis G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc \u015eirin, Deniz Bozkurt and Orhan Seyfi Guner) appeared at the hearing for the purpose of contradicting Mr Ulusoy\u2019s evidence, Mr Ulusoy\u2019s statement is necessary to put the evidence given by those three witnesses in context. Accordingly, the Tribunal maintains Mr Ulusoy\u2019s Witness Statement on the record.\n\nArt 4(7) of the IBA Rules of Taking Evidence in International Arbitration (2010 version) states that: ***\"If a witness whose appearance has been requested pursuant to Article 8.1 fails without a valid reason to appear for testimony at an Evidentiary Hearing, the Arbitral Tribunal shall disregard any Witness Statement related to that Evidentiary Hearing by that witness unless, in exceptional circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal decides otherwise\".***\n\n**18. Witness Statement of Enis Guclu Sirin dated 25 August 2009**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nMr Sirin was an employee of the SDIF who had worked at its Collection Department in 2004, and was working in its Auditing Department at the time he gave his Witness Statement. He was (when working for the Collection Department in 2004) tasked with carrying out enforcement and attachment procedures. Within the scope of those duties, he participated in attachment procedures carried out with respect to various companies owned by the Uzan family.\n\n337.\n\nHe deposed, among other things, as follows.\n\n337.1 On 29 March 2004, he went to the second floor of the Dogus Building with some other SDIF officials and police officers to perform an inspection, and to carry out attachment procedures if valuable property was found.\n\n337.2 His evidence was as follows:\n\n*\"On the 2nd floor, we found some safes in the office and lounge of Kemal Uzan, in the Board of Directors room, in Yavuz Uzan\u2019s office and in the corridor. After the safes in the Board of Directors room were opened, I saw that there were stacked share certificates in open form in them (by \"open form\", I mean the certificates were not wrapped or packaged). I took out and checked some of the share certificates and saw that they were \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates\".*\n\n337.3 Although he and his team opened the safes in Kemal Uzan\u2019s offices and in the corridor (in which they found, amongst other items, documents in packages), he saw no \u00c7EA\u015e or Kepez share certificates packaged in brown paper, nor did he see the name \"Libananco\" written anywhere.\n\n**19. Cross-examination of Mr Sirin**\n-------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe material portions of Mr Sirin\u2019s oral testimony are as follows.\n\n338.1 He confirmed that he did not participate in any attachment procedures in the Rumeli Building and therefore did not have any knowledge of the existence of packaging (or otherwise) of the share certificates in the Rumeli Building (Tr 435:7-435:13).\n\n338.2 On 29 March 2004, the purpose of his visit to the Dogus Building was to attach property belonging to a company called Rumeli Holding Incorporated. However, his team *\"put down everything that [they] found there in as much detail as possible in the Minutes [of Attachment]\"* (Tr 443:5-443:20). If any property marked \"Libananco\" was sighted, this would have been recorded in the Minutes of Attachment as well (Tr 444:6-444:8).\n\n**20. Witness Statement of Deniz Bozkurt dated 25 August 2009**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nDeniz Bozkurt stated that on 25 January 2005, he started working as Company Manager in the Uzan Group companies. He explained during the hearing that none of the members of the Uzan family were associated with the latter companies once he became the manager because those companies were taken over by the SDIF. It was therefore the Board of Directors of those companies (who were in turn appointed by the SDIF) that appointed him as Company Manager of the Uzan Group companies (Tr 453:7-453:20).\n\n340.\n\nIn March 2004, prior to the commencement of his duties, attachment proceedings had been carried out on property found on the basement floor of the Rumeli Building and on the second floor of the Dogus Building.\n\n341.\n\nAfter assuming his duties, he went to the basement floor of the Rumeli Building and the second floor of Dogus Building together with one Devrim Yucel, the custodian of these areas (then already sealed by the SDIF).\n\n342.\n\nThe crux of his evidence was as follows.\n\n342.1 In the basement of the Rumeli Building, he saw about 90 steel cabinets mostly containing share certificates in *\"open form... not wrapped or packaged\".*\n\n342.2 On the second floor of the Dogus Building, he saw share certificates in the safes located in the Board of Directors meeting room and lounge, stacked in *\"open form\".*\n\n342.3 Further, he participated in the inventory process of the share certificates in the basement of the Rumeli Building from 7 March 2005 to 20 June 2005. 91 steel cabinets containing share certificates and coupons were located there. Many of the share certificates found in the basement of the Rumeli Building were \u00c7EA\u015e share certificates, but none of the cabinets were marked \"Libananco\".\n\n342.4 The share certificates on the second floor of the Dogus Building were documented in a similar fashion from 7 July 2005 and 11 August 2005. However, these were stored in safes and in a less ordered arrangement. If there was a name written at the place where the inventoried share certificates were located, that name would have been entered into the inventory records. Again, the name \"Libananco\" was not recorded in any of those entries.\n\n343.\n\nMr Bozkurt supplemented the evidence in his Witness Statement as follows during direct examination.\n\n343.1 He went to both the Rumeli (basement) and Dogus Buildings (second floor) some time after he started work as Company Manager in the Uzan Group companies (i.e. after January 2005) (Tr 450:6-451:1).\n\n343.2 Although there were share certificates in both locations, he did not see any packages with the name \"Libananco\" on them, nor had he heard of \"Libananco\" at that time (Tr 451:12-451:22).\n\n**21. Cross-examination of Mr Bozkurt**\n---------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe material portions of Mr Bozkurt\u2019s oral testimony are as follows.\n\n344.1 The attachment proceedings of which he was in charge were directed only at the 118 companies in relation to which he had been appointed Company Manager (Tr 458:4-458:9).\n\n344.2 He confirmed that, although attachment proceedings had been carried out on property found in the basement of the Rumeli Building and the second floor of the Dogus Building in March 2004 (prior to his appointment as Company Manager in January 2005), he himself did not take part in those proceedings (Tr 454:15-455:1).\n\n344.3 He only visited the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings *\"around 10 to 15 days\"* after his appointment in January 2005. Accordingly, he could not confirm the state of the share certificates (i.e. wrapped or otherwise) in March 2004. However, he testified that his colleagues who carried out the inspection and attachment procedures in March 2004 had advised him that the share certificates were not packaged (Tr 465:7-465:10).\n\n344.4 There were one million and 250,000 \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates respectively in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings at the time he and his team conducted the inventory. He was asked whether he looked at all 1,250,000 of these share certificates. His response was that:\n\n*\"... obviously the inventory process took a long time. Had they been in packages, we would have been able to see them without necessarily having to count the Share Certificates\"* (Tr 473:11-473:17).\n\n**22. Witness Statement of Orhan Seyfi G\u00fcner dated 25 August 2009**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nMr G\u00fcner started working at the SDIF in 2001. In 2004, he was appointed as the President of the Collection Department Group. He deposed that, on 3 July 2003, Imar Bank\u2019s (a bank owned by the Uzan family) licence to carry out banking operations and accept deposits was revoked by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. Thereafter, proceedings were initiated in order to collect the debts resulting from the unlawful operations of imar Bank.\n\n346.\n\nTo this end, inspection and attachment procedures were carried out at the Rumeli Building on 23 March 2004 and the Dogus Building on 29 and 30 March 2004. Mr Guner\u2019s evidence was, among other things, as follows.\n\n346.1 He was present throughout the inspection and attachment procedures on 23 March 2004 at the Rumeli Building and on 30 March 2004 (the second day of the inspection and attachment procedures) at the Dogus Building.\n\n346.2 There was a room containing steel cabinets in the basement of the Rumeli Building. The names \"Metas\" and \"Simetri\" were written on some of those cabinets. Some of the cabinets had share certificates stacked on the shelves inside them. However, these share certificates were not wrapped.\n\n346.3 He deposed that:\n\n*\"Contrary to what Faruk Ulusoy says in his witness statement, the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates we saw were positioned on the shelves in the steel cabinets in open form and were not packaged, in brown paper or otherwise. Thus we did not open any packaging paper as he suggests.*\n\n*I was present in the basement area [of the Rumeli Building] for the entire time that Faruk Ulusoy was present. I saw no wrapping around the share certificates and no name written on them. I do not understand Faruk Ulusoy\u2019s reference to the \"foreign name.\" I can say that I did not see the name \"Libananco\" anywhere during the inspection\".*\n\n347.\n\nDuring direct examination, Mr G\u00fcner was asked whether it would have been a significant observation to him if the share certificates were wrapped or packaged in brown paper. His response was:\n\n*\"Of course, it would have been because when we go for attachments, we see the... Share Certificates there. If they had been bundled in paper, we must have had unwrapped them before we saw the Share Certificates... And if there had been a share [sic] with a name on it, then I would have been reminded of the owner of that share [sic]. This was important for us because... I remember them in live form and [sic] no wrapping and no name on them\"* (Tr 378:21-379:9).\n\n**23. Cross-examination of Mr G\u00fcner**\n-------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe material portions of Mr Guner\u2019s oral testimony are as follows.\n\n348.1 Mr G\u00fcner confirmed that he saw about a hundred steel cabinets in the basement of the Rumeli Building. There were share certificates stacked on the shelves inside the first one or two cabinets that were opened. These share certificates, which had no wrapping on them, were those of \u00c7EA\u015e. METAS, Gaziantep Cement and Bartin Cement. In addition, there were *\"many coupons of the Kepez company\"* (Tr 396:18-397:14).\n\n348.2 Mr G\u00fcner was asked whether he had the opportunity to look inside all *\"100\"* of the cabinets in the Rumeli Building. His response was as follows:\n\n*\"I looked at most of them... I don\u2019t think there were too many that I didn\u2019t look at, but, of course, it\u2019s not possible for me to know whether they are wrapped or not... in a few of the cabinets that I didn\u2019t look at, of course, I can\u2019t say if there were Share Certificates or if they were wrapped or not\"* (Tr 409:13-411:3).\n\n348.3 The Minutes of Attachment corresponding to the procedures at the Rumeli Building on 23 March 2004 (Exhibit El-209) showed that he and his team arrived at the location at 11.30 am. He testified that he and his team probably left at about 6.30 or 7.00 pm in the evening, and that he was in the room where the steel cabinets where located throughout the entire process, save for a toilet break (Tr 423:16-424:9).\n\n348.4 The share certificates in the Dogus Building were positioned in the same manner as those in the Rumeli Building and were likewise *\"not packaged in any way\"* (Tr 402:19-402:21).\n\n***D. Forensic analysis of the documents produced by the Claimant***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nPursuant to the Respondent\u2019s document request, the Tribunal, on 1 May 2008, ordered the Claimant to produce several categories of documents upon which the Claimant\u2019s claim was based for examination. On 2 June 2008, the Claimant produced, among other things, the following photocopied documents:\n\n(a) the Instrument of Transfer purportedly reflecting the acquisition of Libananco by Mr T\u00fcrkkan on 1 April 2002;\n\n(b) the 32 STAs relating to the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates allegedly purchased by Libananco from Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003;\n\n(c) a \"Share Acquisition Report\" dated 20 May 2003, which likewise reflected that Libananco\u2019s share acquisitions occurred between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003;\n\n(d) Libananco\u2019s board minutes bearing dates from 2002 and 2003, recording the purported transactions in the same range of dates (i.e. between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003);\n\n(e) an unsigned financial statement for the year ending 31 December 2002, allegedly reflecting a shareholder loan by means of which Libananco had paid for the share certificates in question; and\n\n(f) Libananco\u2019s tax return for the year ending 31 December 2002.\n\n350.\n\nBy its letter of 9 October 2008, the Respondent subsequently sought production of the originals of the documents produced by the Claimant on 2 June 2008. On 3 November 2008, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to make the originals of those documents available for forensic inspection in Washington, D.C. The Claimant provided some (but not all) of the originals of the said documents for inspection by the Respondent\u2019s forensic document experts RWL in November and December 2008. These documents were marked and identified as LIB-1 through LIB-119.\n\n351.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s experts reported their findings on LIB-1 through LIB-119 in a Laboratory Report dated 3 March 2009. The Claimant\u2019s forensic document experts in turn filed their respective reports on the same as follows: (i) report of 25 May 2009 by Aginsky Forensic Document Dating Laboratory, Inc.; (ii) report of 22 May 2009 by Lloyd W Cunningham; (iii) reports of 26 May 2009, 1 June 2009, 27 July 2009 and 3 September 2009 by Document Examination Consultants, Inc.; (iv) report of 1 June 2009 by Peter V Tytell; and (v) Declaration of Howard Rile of 27 May 2009. In response to all the Claimant\u2019s expert reports on document forensics, the Respondent\u2019s experts filed a Second Laboratory Report of 14 August 2009. In further response to the laher, all the Claimant\u2019s experts collectively filed a Combined Report of Claimant\u2019s Forensic Document Examination Experts of 8 October 2009.\n\n352.\n\nFinally, on 31 October 2009, the experts from both sides filed a Joint Report of Forensic Document Experts relating (again) to the documents marked LIB-1 through LIB-119. This report identified general areas of agreement and disagreement organised by category of documents. The categories of documents were as follows:\n\n(a) the minutes of directors\u2019 meetings and minutes of management meetings bearing dates between July 2002 and October 2002;\n\n(b) the Instrument of Transfer bearing the date 1 April 2002;\n\n(c) the three lehers showing the individual resignations of Mrs Ero Petsa, Mrs Eleni Kyriacou and Mr Polakis Sarris from Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors, each bearing the date 1 April 2002;\n\n(d) the STAs which bore dates between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003; and\n\n(e) the share custody invoices (i.e. Exhibit H-60) bearing the date 16 May 2003.\n\nIt was acknowledged in the Joint Report of Forensic Document Experts that neither side\u2019s experts made any significant forensic findings in relation to LIB-37 through LIB-43 (i.e. the Share Acquisition Report dated 20 May 2003) and LIB-48 through LIB-111 (Libananco\u2019s financial statements and tax returns for the years 2002 to 2004), all of which were photocopies and therefore not original documents.\n\n353.\n\nFurther, on 3 May 2009, Libananco produced (submitted together with the C.CM) copies of purported board and management committee meeting minutes which bore dates spanning from 12 August 2002 to 22 June 2005. In October 2009, the Respondent\u2019s experts RWL examined what purported to be originals of 28 such documents, comprising 34 pages in total and similarly marked and identified as LIB-128 through LIB-161. The Respondent\u2019s experts presented their findings on these documents in a supplementary report dated 20 October 2009. The Claimant\u2019s experts Dr Valery Aginsky and Mr Peter V Tytell responded to the latter by way of a Response dated 8 February 2010.\n\n354.\n\nThe principal purpose of the forensic examination was to determine whether the documents in question (i.e. LIB-1 through LIB-119 and LIB-128 through LIB-161) were created on the dates they bore. In addition, the STAs were also examined by the Parties\u2019 experts to determine whether or not the signatures on them were genuine. The significance of the extensive forensic examination undertaken by both Parties\u2019 experts is that the Claimant\u2019s case would be weakened if it was proved that the documents in question (many of which were key to establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in these proceedings) were backdated and/or not otherwise created before the critical date of 12 June 2003.\n\n355.\n\nThe documents in question were subject to a battery of tests by the experts from both sides. However, after the Parties\u2019 expert reports were submitted, the Claimant\u2019s witness Mr T\u00fcrkkan gave evidence to the effect that many or all of the documents originally supplied for forensic examination had in fact been reprinted in the period 2005 to 2007.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore has to consider the forensic analysis of the categories of documents listed in paragraphs 352(a) to (e) and 353 above in the light of this significant admission by Mr T\u00fcrkkan. It now does so.\n\n356.1 The minutes of directors\u2019 meetings and minutes of management meetings which bore dates between July 2002 and 22 June 2005, The Tribunal considers that forensic analysis of these documents did not give any meaningful or conclusive result since Mr T\u00fcrkkan admitted that these documents were reprinted in November 2005, and that these (i.e. the reprinted documents) were the very documents produced in the arbitration by the Claimant. He further confirmed that the originals of the minutes had either been misplaced or discarded (see paragraph 264 above). Further, in relation to the \"Al\" minutes (which were likewise examined), Mr T\u00fcrkkan admitted that these were not only printed and signed but also drafted in 2006 (see paragraph 265 above).\n\n356.2 The Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002, Mr T\u00fcrkkan, in his First Witness Statement, likewise confirmed that this document was reprinted and/or re-signed by him sometime in 2007 (see paragraphs\n\n240.2 to 240.4 above). Further, both Parties\u2019 experts agree that the Instrument of Transfer could not have been produced until 2007, owing to the presence of a counterfeit protection security code found in the colour toner used to print this document.\n\n356.3 The resignation letters of Mrs Ero Petsa. Mrs Eleni Kyriacou and Mr Polakis Sarris from Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors, each dated 1 April 2002, The Parties\u2019 experts had relatively little to say about these documents. The findings in respect of these documents were not addressed or mentioned in the Joint Report of Forensic Document Experts. The Tribunal does not consider that significant or helpful conclusions can be drawn from the forensic evidence relating to these documents.\n\n356.4 The STAs which bore dates between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003, Mr T\u00fcrkkan likewise admitted that the STAs were reprinted in November 2005 (see paragraphs 264 and 264.1 above). Although it is not clear whether *all* of the STAs that were subject to forensic examination were reprinted, Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence suggests that at least *some* of the laher were printed (or reprinted) in 2005. Unsurprisingly, therefore, both Parties\u2019 experts were able to agree on, among other things, the following matters (all of which are not inconsistent with the fact that a number of the STAs were printed after the dates that appeared on the face of those documents).\n\n(i) Seven of the 32 STAs produced by the Claimant were all stamped sometime after 14 February 2005, based on the presence of a transitory defect in the stamp impressions, and lehers from the manufacturer and distributor of the stamp pad.\n\n(ii) Ink transfer was present on the back page of 29 of the 32 STAs (i.e. inked areas visibly similar in colour to the \"Libananco\" stamps on the front page of the documents), indicating that these STAs could have been in contact with each other shortly after the \"Libananco\" ink stamps were applied.\n\n(iii) Although impression evidence atone could not establish the specific dates on which the STAs were signed (by either the seller or the buyer) or otherwise prepared, it was capable of establishing the order in which the documents were signed, and could determine if the order was consistent with the dates which appeared on the documents. The impression evidence in this case was a basis for the following conclusions:\n\n(1) thirteen of the STAs which bore dates earlier than 15 May 2003 were *\"probably\"* signed sometime *after* the STA dated 15 May 2003 was created;\n\n(2) two of the STAs which bore dates earlier than 13 May 2003 were *\"probably\"* signed sometime *after* the STA dated 13 May 2003 was created;\n\n(3) three of the STAs which bore dates earlier than 6 May 2003 were *\"probably\"* signed sometime *after* the STA dated 6 May 2003 was created;\n\n(4) two of the STAs which bore dates earlier than 17 April 2003 were *\"probably\"* signed sometime *after* the STA dated 17 April 2003 was created; and\n\n(5) one STA which bore a date earlier than 17 April 2003 was *\"probably\"* signed sometime *after* the STA dated 17 April 2003 was created.\n\n356.5 The share custody invoices dated 16 May 2003, The Parties\u2019 experts had relatively little to say about these documents. In any event, the Respondent\u2019s experts RWL observed that these documents were photocopies. The observation was not contradicted by the Claimant\u2019s experts. The Tribunal does not consider that significant or helpful conclusions can be drawn from the forensic evidence on these documents.\n\n357.\n\nThe other documents provided to each Party\u2019s document forensic experts (i.e. the Share Acquisition Report dated 20 May 2003 and Libananco\u2019s financial statements and tax returns for the years 2002 to 2004) need not be considered by the Tribunal for present purposes since these were also not original documents, the consequence of which was that both Parties\u2019 experts made no significant forensic findings in respect of these documents.\n\n358.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that, despite the high professional quality of the experts\u2019 work, the forensic evidence provides little assistance on the central issue of whether Libananco acquired shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez before 12 June 2003. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it is unnecessary to make any further determination in relation to the forensic document evidence.\n\n***E. Forensic analysis of the floppy disks produced by Mr T\u00fcrkkan***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, in June 2009, the Claimant produced eight floppy disks that Mr T\u00fcrkkan allegedly used to backup the STAs and other corporate documents. The Claimant sought to rely on the metadata associated with the electronic versions of the documents stored on the floppy disks as proof that the documents in question were created on or before the dates they bore on their face (and hence were not backdated).\n\n360.\n\nThese floppy disks contained: (i) the STAs; (ii) the model agreement based on which the actual STAs were drafted; (iii) Libananco\u2019s corporate minutes as well as (iv) a series of faxed documents which were intra-family agreements. The Claimant submitted that the category of documents (i) to (iii) were backup files which were stored on the floppy disks. The last category of documents discovered on the floppy disks (i.e. the faxed documents) were deleted files recovered in the course of forensic examination. The intra-family agreements were those that, according to Hakan Uzan, were executed in order to accomplish the internal transfers of shares within the Uzan family prior to any transfer of shares to Libananco (see paragraphs 210 and 211 above).\n\n361.\n\nThe floppy disks were subject to examination by the Claimant\u2019s forensic experts Stroz Friedberg and Mr Eoghan Casey, and by the Respondent\u2019s forensic experts Curtis W Rose & Associates.\n\n362.\n\nThe Claimant made the following submissions, based on the forensic analysis of the floppy disks.\n\n362.1 Metadata associated with the electronic versions of the STAs and Libananco\u2019s minutes constituted proof that the STAs and minutes were created on or before the date they were signed (hence the STAs were not backdated). In other words, its experts found affirmative *\"evidence of authenticity\"* on the files stored on the floppy disks, suggesting that the STAs were created in 2002 and 2003, and that Libananco\u2019s minutes were created over the period 2002 to 2005 (i.e. the dates that appeared on the face of the documents produced in the arbitration).\n\n362.2 If the floppy disks contained fraudulently backdated documents, a computer forensics expert would be able to identify significant traces of backdating. The Claimant\u2019s experts found no such evidence and, indeed, their findings were to the contrary.\n\n362.3 Additional evidence of the authenticity of the files on the floppy disks came in the form of 16 deleted faxes that had been sent in April 2003, saved to one of the floppy disks and then subsequently deleted. The deleted faxes contained information in the fax headers showing the date and time they had been sent, and these were consistent with the file system metadata (and/or other data) relating to those files as well as the dates which those documents bore. This was significant evidence of authenticity of the deleted faxes since the date and time information came from an independent source (i.e. the fax headers).\n\n362.4 The Claimant\u2019s experts found that many of the documents discovered on the floppy disks revealed characteristics that were typical of what one might expect to see in documents that were created, used and edited in real time over an extended period (\"Pattern of Use Evidence\"). The Pattern of Use Evidence showed the authenticity of those documents since such changes had to be made manually by a person over time, and could not have occurred as a result of some automatic process.\n\n363.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent argued that the floppy disks contained anomalies consistent with backdating, and made the following submissions, based on the forensic analysis of the floppy disks.\n\n363.1 The only way to know for certain whether the documents on the floppy disks were backdated was to examine the source computer which was used to create, store, edit, print or produce the electronic files on the floppy disks. However, since Mr T\u00fcrkkan, by his own admission, intentionally destroyed or abandoned his computers, the Tribunal should infer that the electronic documents stored on the floppy disks were not authentic.\n\n363.2 There was an anomaly on Floppy Disk 1 which the Claimant\u2019s experts concede was consistent with intentional backdating. The disk contained metadata which indicated that no file activity took place after 15 April 2002, but yet the disk contained a deleted file with associated metadata which indicated that the file was saved to the disk six months later (on 24 October 2002).\n\n363.3 There was an anomaly on Floppy Disk 7. This disk contained two types of files: template STAs and the deleted fax files. The metadata associated with the deleted faxes showed that they were saved to the disk on 4 April 2003, whilst that of the template STAs showed that they were saved to the disk on 7 April 2003. An analysis of the metadata and the root directory structure of the disk showed that, consistent with normal computer operations, the deleted fax files should have been overwritten by the template STAs, which were saved later in time, but this was not the case.\n\n363.4 The Pattern of Use Evidence referred to by the Claimant could have been easily manipulated to create a false impression of normal use.\n\n363.5 The Claimant\u2019s argument that the deleted faxes were authentic documents on the basis that the fax headers independently confirm the time at which they were faxed is flawed. This was because fax headers can be backdated. The Respondent\u2019s experts were able to create a backdated fax for demonstration purposes, with header and metadata information matching those found on Floppy Disk 7.\n\n364.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent raised the following issues in relation to the floppy disks themselves.\n\n364.1 The belated appearance of the floppy disks in these proceedings was suspicious since they were only disclosed in 2009, although they should have been disclosed in 2008 (assuming that the disks had existed at that time).\n\n364.2 The Claimant\u2019s explanations regarding the provenance of the floppy disks undermined their authenticity.\n\n365.\n\nThe experts on both sides produced a Joint Report of Computer Forensics Experts dated 27 October 2009 pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order dated 8 July 2008, setting out the areas of agreement and disagreement.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the experts on both sides were able to agree on, among other things, the following propositions.\n\n366.1 Floppy disks represent only a snapshot in time of the lifecycle of questioned documents. It would be preferable to have access to the computers used to create, edit and/or store the documents because they would provide access to external reference points and could reveal important information concerning the lifecycles of the documents.\n\n366.2 Although anomalies can be identified in the absence of the originating computer system(s), the original systems could reveal additional information that would indicate alteration or manipulation of the files in a data set such as the floppy disks. (In addition, the Claimant\u2019s experts submitted that the originating computer system(s) would also be able to reveal additional information indicating the authenticity of the files examined.)\n\n366.3 When a computer is available, validating the accuracy of the computer clock is an important step in assessing the authenticity of electronic files like Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel documents because the computer clock can be incorrect.\n\n366.4 It is possible to fabricate a backdated floppy disk with no anomalies.\n\n367.\n\nIn addition, the Parties\u2019 experts made the following observations.\n\n367.1 The Claimant\u2019s experts submitted that no evidence was found that negated the authenticity of the files on the floppy disks or proved that the files were backdated. The Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 position was that Floppy Disks 1 and 7 both had anomalies *\"that [could] be explained by backdating\".*\n\n367.2 The Claimant\u2019s experts submitted that the anomalies on Floppy Disk 1 could be the result of backdating, but they could also occur in the absence of backdating. With the available evidence, it was not possible to determine definitively whether the anomalies on Floppy Disk 1 were the result of backdating or the result of normal user activity. The Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 position on this point was that without the originating computer(s), *\"a significant amount of evidence that could prove backdating was unavailable for forensic examination\".*\n\n367.3 The Claimant\u2019s experts submitted that, for each of the sixteen deleted fax files, the date and time information on the fax header and that of the file system metadata were from independent sources, yet both reported the same date. The Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 reply was that the fax header information *\"could easily be manipulated during a backdating process\".*\n\n367.4 The Claimant\u2019s experts submitted that the Pattern of Use Evidence referred to above is common when people are creating, editing and formatting digital documents over time during the normal course of business. In the case of the floppy disks, these showed clear and compelling behavioral usage patterns typical of documents which were created and modified over time during the normal course of business. The Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 position was that:\n\n*\"Patterns of use such as small document changes may or may not be normal characteristics for this data set. As such, they may or may not support the authenticity of the dataset. In addition, such patterns could be reproduced by an operator engaged in creating a backdated dataset\".*\n\n368.\n\nHowever, the computer forensics experts on both sides had diametrically opposed views in relation to the following statement posed to them: *\"It would be difficult to fabricate a realistic set of backdated documents like those on the Floppy Disks\"* (Joint Report of Computer Forensics Experts dated 27 October 2009, p 9).\n\n368.1 The Claimant\u2019s experts\u2019 view was as follows:\n\n*\"Agree. It would have been difficult to fabricate a realistic set of backdated documents like those on the Floppy Disks. For example, it would have been necessary to change the computer clock date alone more than 30 times, in such a way to coincide with external events in the past. In addition, to fabricate just the Share Transfer Agreement spreadsheets, it would have been necessary to resize column widths, reset margins, reset print areas, change certain cell colors, change certain cell alignment [sic], change certain label names and change certain descriptor labels. Furthermore, it would have been necessary to independently configure a fax machine to send the documents to a computer running the WinFax application. Finally, this was all completed with a relatively small number of date discrepancies compared with a large number of consistencies\".*\n\n368.2 The Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 view was as follows:\n\n*\"Disagree. Fabricating a realistic set of backdated documents like those on the floppy disks would not be difficult, given proper planning and resources.*  ***The dataset is not a replication of an actual dataset, so there is no established baseline for comparison, making the fabrication much easier, especially considering the fact that the external reference points, e.g. the originating computer(s), are not available.***  *Finally, areas presented as complex, such as the referenced \"consistent date relationships\" from the deleted carved files, are actually the byproduct of the creation process. As the dataset grows larger, it may become a more complex undertaking to backdate; however, with only the external media (the floppy disks) for review, the dataset actually becomes eight independent datasets that*  ***can potentially be fabricated without difficulty.***  *Combining the eight datasets and corresponding relationships, with proper planning and preparation,*  ***may potentially be accomplished***  *without any particular difficulty (especially considering that there is no baseline or reference point)\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n369.\n\nBased on the expert reports submitted by both Parties, the Tribunal is able to arrive at the following views.\n\n369.1 Although the Respondent\u2019s experts submitted that there were anomalies on Floppy Disks 1 and 7, they were unable to provide any concrete forensic evidence to substantiate the allegations of backdating. The position of the Respondent\u2019s experts was merely that the anomalies identified could be the result of backdating, but may not necessarily have been so. This is not an affirmative conclusion and the Tribunal is unable to accept it as such.\n\n369.2 In relation to the fax headers, the Respondent\u2019s experts likewise submitted that they could have been manipulated, but this may not necessarily have been done as there was no forensic evidence either way.\n\n369.3 In addition, the causal link or relationship between the existence of the anomalies in question and the backdating of documents on the floppy disks has not been clearly established by the experts on both sides. This is especially so since both Parties\u2019 experts agreed that it was possible to create backdated documents on floppy disks with no anomalies.\n\n369.4 Further, since both Parties\u2019 experts agreed that: (i) the floppy disks represented only a snapshot in time of the life cycle of the documents in question and (ii) it was impossible to be certain of whether the documents on the floppy disks were backdated without having had the chance to examine the source computer(s) used to create, store, edit, print or otherwise produce the electronic files, the Tribunal considers that it should be slow, in the absence of objective forensic evidence either way, to conclude (as the Respondent has suggested) that the documents on the floppy disks had been backdated.\n\n370.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal finds that the computer forensic evidence is not conclusive of the issue of when the documents stored on the floppy disks were created or otherwise accessed.\n\n371.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal observes that the electronic versions of Libananco\u2019s minutes and the STAs stored on the floppy disks were unsigned soft copies. This being the case, even if the files on the floppy disks were not backdated, they can only, at best, be evidence of when the documents were electronically created or otherwise accessed on the source computer(s), and are therefore not evidence of when those documents were actually signed and/or executed.\n\n372.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that, despite the high professional quality of the experts\u2019 work, the computer forensic evidence is of limited assistance in determining whether the documents in question (i.e. those set out in paragraph 360 above) were backdated. Consequently, the Tribunal declines to give further consideration to the electronic files stored on the floppy disks.\n\n***F. Audio evidence: admissibility of Exhibits R-113 and R- 771***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nThe Respondent tendered, and sought to admit as evidence, transcripts of selected portions of audio recordings of telephone conversations between Hakan Uzan and Cem Uzan. The first was Exhibit R-113 (the alleged transcript of a telephone call on 16 August 2004) and the second was Exhibit R-771 (the alleged transcript of a telephone call on 8 October 2004).\n\n374.\n\nThe Respondent contended that these recordings of conversations which took place between Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan were legitimate as they were authorised under Turkish law. The Respondent submitted that Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan were proper subjects of criminal investigation. The conversations at issue formed part of an extensive set of recordings (551 in total) intercepted by the Respondent over a period of months and contained on 21 CDs.\n\n375.\n\nThe contents of Exhibits R-113 and R-771 are prejudicial to the Claimant\u2019s case. In addition, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s submission that the transcripts in question (i.e. Exhibits R-113 and R-771) appeared, on their face, to be an incomplete account of the conversations they purported to transcribe and further that they were transcribed by the Respondent\u2019s agents. The Tribunal also observes that the transcripts were in English, but the telephone conversations so transcribed were (according to the transcripts themselves) conducted in three languages (i.e. English, German and Turkish). The Respondent\u2019s own witness Ahmet Teke (of the Turkish National Police) admitted that the transcripts included only portions of the conversations relevant to the investigations being carried out. The Claimant therefore contended that the transcripts in question violated the common law rule of completeness with respect to evidence (which requires evidence to be considered in context and, in cases where only part of a record is presented, for the whole of the record in question to be examined if necessary).11 In any event, the Claimant\u2019s witnesses Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan disputed the authenticity of the transcripts.\n\nThe Claimant relies on rules of evidence in Canada and the USA as legal authority for this proposition, but acknowledges that the Tribunal is neither bound by nor required to consider domestic rules of evidence\n\n376.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal considers that Exhibits R-113 and R-771 may only be admitted as evidence in these proceedings if the Tribunal is satisfied that they were accurate transcriptions of actual telephone recordings.\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s forensic audio expert Bek Tek LLC (whose senior forensic examiner Mr Bruce E Koenig testified) examined a CD containing the audio recording of the telephone conversation which allegedly related to Exhibit R-113. The Respondent\u2019s forensic audio expert Audio Forensic Center (whose associate Dr Durand R Begault testified in these proceedings) had before it for its analysis the complete set of 551 audio recordings spread over 21 CDs (as described above).\n\n378.\n\nIt is necessary (for reasons which will soon become apparent), before delving into the technical issues and expert evidence, to state the provenance of the audio recordings in question. In this regard, the Witness Statement of the Respondent\u2019s witness Serkan Gercel dated 11 August 2009 stated as follows:\n\n*\"... I have been working at the National Intelligence Organization of the Republic of Turkey (NIO) since 1996.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The satellite interception system (Technical System) that was installed at the NIO at that time automatically recorded the communications it detected on the telephone numbers entered into the System. It automatically recorded the called and calling numbers, the starting and ending date and time of the calls, and other identifying information. The Technical System did not allow any interference by an operator in the recording process.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*In this case, since the call recordings would be transmitted to a user outside the organization, once the Technical System created the audio files, I burned the files onto a CD or CDs using the computer on the same network as the Technical System that I used. I assigned names to the files contained in these CDs in a systematic manner.*  ***When I burned the file of a conversation onto a CD, this audio file was deleted from the Technical System...***  *the CDs at issue were then transmitted in a closed envelope to the representative designated by the General Police Directorate (GPD).*\n\n\u2026\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n379.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position was that the transcripts should not be admitted as evidence because the underlying recorded conversations were not authenticated. According to the Claimant, this was because the \"original\" file could no longer be accessed. In this regard, the Claimant\u2019s expert witness Mr Koenig deposed in his Witness Statement of 18 June 2009 as follows:\n\n*\"It is impossible to authenticate this conversation without access to the recording(s) in their original, native system format. This is required for a proper scientific analysis of the recording(s) in context with other voice data and metadata that was written by the system just before, during, and just after the designated conversation; such information would not be retained when converted and written to a CD.*\n\n*... The only way to authenticate this conversation would be to examine the recording as stored in the system used by NIO [i.e. Turkey\u2019s National Intelligence Office], using the software NIO used to record and store it.*  ***A CD copy of the conversation in isolation is incapable of permitting authentication of the conversation, since a CD would not contain the related data and metadata necessary to verify that the recording has not been altered in any way\".***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n380.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent\u2019s position was (necessarily) that the audio recordings underlying the transcripts in question were authentic. Its expert Audio Forensic Centre stated in its report of 14 August 2009 that (at paragraph 63):\n\n*\"we conclude that it is highly likely that the 551 audio files of the Main Set of Recordings - including the recordings of the calls made on 16 August and 8 October 2004 - are unaltered recordings of contemporaneous events\".*\n\nThe methodology of the Respondent\u2019s expert was set out in its report (at paragraph 2):\n\n*\"Audio Forensic Center was asked to investigate forensically whether the recordings of the conversations were consistent with an unaltered record of contemporaneous events.*  ***To do this, we inspected sound file metadata (complementary digital data associated with the sound files), considered external corroborative information and records***  *and in some cases performed audio forensic analysis on the sound files themselves. Our techniques included:*\n\n***\u2022 Comparison between metadata and sound file duration;***\n\n*\u2022 Analysis of the consistency of indicated satellite telephone system* *data;*\n\n***\u2022 Comparison of external telephone records and metadata for dialed*** ***telephone number;***\n\n*\u2022 Analysis of the consistency of the main features of the audio data* *(e.g., sample rate, encoding, and number of channels);*\n\n*\u2022 Over selected files, waveform analysis and critical listening; and*\n\n*\u2022 Between files that should logically be identical, MD5 checksum* *analysis\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n381.\n\nThe principal difference of opinion between the experts from both sides was the issue of whether the audio recordings in question could be examined forensically, independent of the device used to create the recording, allowing experts (as a result of that analysis) to draw conclusions on the integrity of those audio recordings. The positions of the respective experts on this key issue as stated in the Joint Report of Audio Experts (paragraph 19) are set out below:\n\n*\"(a) Begault [Respondent\u2019s expert]: AGREE. First, the recordings can be analyzed for signs of tampering or alteration. Begault 1st, 4, Begault 2nd, 19. Second, they can be analyzed for consistency with extrinsic evidence. Begault 2nd, 51-53. Third, conclusions can be drawn concerning whether or not the recordings are consistent with an unaltered record of contemporaneous events. Begault 2nd, \u00b6\u00b6 2. As a* *result,*  ***an audio forensic expert can opine on the likelihood of alteration based on a collection of observed facts and using scientific procedures.***  *Begault 2nd, 20.*\n\n*(b) Koenig/Lacey [Claimant\u2019s expert]: Disagree. As already explained in great detail above and below in this document and in the BEK TEK LLC Laboratory Report of September 21, 2009, the converted copies on the Main Set of CDs and the R-113 disc can never be scientifically authenticated since they are not original. Concerning the recording system used by the Turkish Intelligence Agency (which would only be helpful if the original recordings were available): if at all possible, the digital authenticity examinations of logging systems should be conducted on the original or an identical recording system with the same proprietary software, and the original audio and metadata reinstalled from a direct backup system. Logging systems almost always use proprietary file formats, compress the audio information to save space, record the digital data with small time segments of audio input from different sources being recorded in a continually interleaved process, and have one or more separate metadata files or tables cataloguing the locations of all the audio input segments. Such systems then use their proprietary software to locate the audio information for a particular recording, such as a telephone conversation, from its many small segments and then convert them to a continuous recording in a more standard audio file format.*  ***This conversion does not provide any of the system information regarding the segmented recordings or any of the other audio data interspersed within the pertinent conversation from other audio signals. Additionally, not all of the descriptive metadata may be included in the new file format, either due to the software instructions or limitations on the metadata configuration in the new format. If an authenticity examiner does not have access to the original recorded audio and metadata of such systems, it is impossible to verify that the audio and metadata information is accurate, complete, and unaltered.***\n\n\u2026\n\n*While it is true that some individuals may \"draw conclusions regarding [the] integrity\" of converted copies, this method of examination and any conclusions drawn from such analyses have no scientific support in peer-reviewed, published literature and \"best practices\" documents, and is not an accepted practice among properly-trained examiners in the field.*\n\n\u2026\".\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n382.\n\nBoth Parties\u2019 experts were able to agree on a Joint Report of Audio Experts dated 27 October 2009. Based on that joint report, the Tribunal observes that both Parties\u2019 experts were able to agree on the following facts and/or propositions (with additional comments from the Claimant\u2019s experts where elaboration was necessary).\n\n382.1 The original recordings (i.e. those produced directly by and onto the recording system during the actual telephone conversations) no longer existed. (However, the Tribunal notes that the definition of an \"original\" recording was disputed).\n\n382.2 The audio recording underlying Exhibit R-113 could not be scientifically confirmed as being \"bit-for-bit\" copies or clones of the original recordings. (The significance of this statement is as follows; the Claimant\u2019s experts accepted that, if the recording was found to a \"bit-for-bit\" copy or clone of the original, then conclusive authenticity results could still be obtained even though the original was not subject to forensic examination.)\n\n382.3 The embedded metadata and file names for the audio recording relating to Exhibit R-113 could be altered without detection. In that regard, the Claimant\u2019s expert submitted that metadata and file names:\n\n*\"can be altered independently or in concert, as appropriate, without leaving traces of the alterations. These alterations include, but are not limited to, modifying the metadata and file name to reflect a different telephone number as the receiving or initiating party, and modifying the metadata and file name to reflect a different date or time of the conversation\".*\n\n382.4 Metadata produced by an operating system for a particular file could be modified through common functions (moving or copying the file to another place on the hard drive or copying the file to a CD), or through the use of third-party software.\n\n382.5 The dates and time assigned by the operating system to a particular file may not have been the time during which the alleged conversations actually took place. Furthermore, the accuracy of the assigned dates and times were limited to software settings and the accuracy of the clock of the computer which had assigned those dates and times.\n\n382.6 The audio data for the recording underlying Exhibit R-113 could be altered without detection. In addition, the Claimant\u2019s experts had the following comment:\n\n*\"These alterations include, but are not limited to, removing portions of the audio recording while maintaining the duration of the file by muting select portions of one party to the other\".*\n\n382.7 The audio data for the recording underlying Exhibit R-113 contained numerous portions of audio samples having zero amplitude, referred to as digital \"Os\". According to the Claimant\u2019s experts, the presence and significance of digital \"Os\" could be explained in the following way (paragraph 2(c) of Bek Tek LLC\u2019s report of 21 September 2009):\n\n*\"To save storage space, these systems often do not record low-amplitude audio information during the original recording process. Then when the original recordings are exported as converted audio files, the system adds digital \"Os\" to the unrecorded portions, which are within and between segments of speech or other audio information.*  ***These unrecorded portions in the converted audio copies can then be used not only for easy editing, as noted above, but these dropout areas can also be shortened or lengthened to cover up various editing processes.***  *For example, if four seconds of speech were removed during an editing process, then digital \"Os\" could be added to a number of locations within the file to make up for the four second loss\".*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s experts therefore made the following comment (in paragraph 17(a) of the Joint Report of Audio Experts):\n\n*\"As demonstrated in the BEK TEK LLC report dated September 21, 2009, audio information can be removed through a muting process, which would leave absolutely no artifacts and would be indistinguishable from any of the digital \"0\" portions introduced by the recording process. Other forms of alterations to the audio information can be performed in a similar manner\".*\n\n382.8 Taken in their totality, 56.30 per cent of the audio samples contained in the recording underlying Exhibit R-113 were digital \"Os\".\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal makes the following findings in relation to the audio recordings underlying Exhibits R-113 and R-771.\n\n383.1 Neither of the Parties\u2019 experts was able to confirm that the audio recordings in question were authentic, since the original recordings or \"bit-for-bit\" clones of the original recordings were not available for forensic examination. In that regard, the Respondent\u2019s experts were able to say no more than that the audio recordings in question were *\"highly likely... [to be] unaltered recordings of contemporaneous events\".*\n\n383.2 The method of forensic analysis adopted by the Respondent\u2019s experts was highly dependent on an examination of the file metadata and a comparison between the file metadata and external records (e.g. telephone records). This is significant because file metadata can be altered without detection (both Parties\u2019 experts agree that this is the case). The Tribunal accepts the evidence of the Claimant\u2019s experts that the file metadata could be altered without detection to change the telephone number and the date and time of the telephone call. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that it is unsafe to rely on the metadata associated with the audio files as evidence of the authenticity of the recordings. To the extent that the Respondent\u2019s experts relied on such analysis to reach their conclusions, such findings are discounted by the Tribunal.\n\n383.3 Importantly, both Parties\u2019 experts agreed that the audio data itself for the recordings in question could be altered without detection.\n\n383.4 Although the Tribunal considers that the combination of factors set out above provides a sufficient basis for it to arrive at a conclusion as to the non-admissibility of Exhibits R-113 and R-771, a further reason for the rejection of Exhibit R-113 is that 56.30 per cent of the audio samples contained in the recording underlying Exhibit R-113 were digital \"Os\" (that recording was thus susceptible to alteration and modification). The Tribunal considers that (in the absence of an examination of the original underlying recording, which both Parties accepted no longer exists) this significantly reduces the probability that the recording underlying Exhibit R-113 was authentic.\n\n384.\n\nGiven the prejudicial nature of the contents of Exhibits R-113 and R-771, and in the light of the factors set out above, the Tribunal concludes that it would be unsafe to admit those exhibits as evidence in these proceedings. Exhibits R-113 and R-771 are accordingly not admitted.\n\n***G. Requirements for a valid transfer of ownership under Turkish law***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute is the issue of whether Libananco acquired ownership of the share certificates in question before 12 June 2003. The issues are therefore whether the following acts alleged by the Claimant were effective (under Turkish law) to transfer ownership of the shares in question from members of the Uzan family (specifically, Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan) to Libananco:\n\n(a) Hakan Uzan\u2019s telephone call to Mr Turkkan in April 2003, informing the latter of (among other things) the transfer of ownership of the share certificates located in Switzerland to Libananco;\n\n(b) the inspection and/or acceptance of delivery of the share certificates located in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings by Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin on 15 May 2003; and\n\n(c) the inspection and/or acceptance of delivery of the share certificates located in ikitelli by Hakan Uzan on 15 May 2003.\n\n386.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will now examine the law in relation to transfer of bearer share certificates to determine whether any or all of the acts alleged were sufficient to transfer ownership of the share certificates to Libananco.\n\n387.\n\nIt is undisputed that the ownership of bearer share certificates under Turkish law is collectively governed by the Turkish Commercial Code and the Civil Code. The Parties\u2019 position on the various requirements for a valid transfer of ownership of the bearer shares (i.e. the share certificates) was as follows.\n\n387.1 Agreement to transfer ownership : It was agreed that the parties to the agreement must understand and agree that the purpose of the transfer of possession is to transfer ownership from the transferor to the transferee. However, the Respondent submitted that the Claimant had no written proof that this requirement has been satisfied. The Claimant submitted that this requirement had been fulfilled through the conclusion of the 32 STAs which were presented to the Tribunal.\n\n387.2 Right of the transferor : The Parties were agreed that the transferor must have the right to dispose of the share certificates being transferred, i.e. the right to transfer ownership. The Respondent alleged that this requirement was not fulfilled because the Claimant had not shown that the purported transferors of the shares to Libananco owned shares corresponding to the quantity he or she allegedly transferred to Libananco. The Claimant\u2019s response was that: (i) the Respondent\u2019s allegations were wrongly based on \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez dividend payouts because of the Respondent\u2019s erroneous assumption that, within the Uzan family, such dividends were received in proportion to each individual\u2019s shareholding; and (ii) there were, in any event, intra-family agreements discovered on Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s floppy disks (as deleted faxes) which showed how each transferor obtained many of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez that he or she eventually transferred to Libananco.\n\n387.3 *Teslim* (i.e. transfer of possession or delivery of the property) : The Parties were agreed that there must be transfer of possession before the rights associated with ownership of the share certificates will accrue to the transferee of such shares. The respective positions of the Parties on this issue are set out in paragraphs 390 to 394 below.\n\n387.4 Cause : The Respondent submitted that the Claimant is also required to establish that there was a valid legal cause for the transfer, i.e. *causa.* The Claimant did not accept that *causa* is a requirement for a valid transfer of ownership under Turkish law. However, the Claimant submitted that, even if such a requirement exists, it had been fulfilled on the facts since Cem Uzan\u2019s evidence (as appears from both his Witness Statements) is that the purpose of the transfers of shares to Libananco was to provide it with a viable asset base.\n\n387.5 Documentation in writing : The Respondent further submitted, among other things, that to establish its ownership, the Claimant would have to show that the alleged deliveries of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates to Libananco in April and May 2003 respectively were proved by a written instrument (since, under Turkish law, legal transactions with values exceeding 40 million liras have to be proved by a written instrument). The Claimant\u2019s position was, among other things, that the Respondent\u2019s contention is incorrect, and that the Claimant\u2019s possession of the share certificates themselves is sufficient proof of both delivery and ownership.\n\n388.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that, under Turkish law, all the above requirements had to be met in order to effect a valid transfer of ownership.\n\n389.\n\nAlthough the Parties disagreed as to whether each of the above elements had been fulfilled (or, in the case of *causa* and documentation in writing, needed to be fulfilled in the first place), the central battleground in the present case was the issue of transfer of possession or *teslim.* In that regard, the Claimant did not dispute that it would have failed to establish that the shares were validly transferred to Libananco if this requirement was not met.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s position on** ***teslim***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nArticle 977 of the Turkish Civil Code states as follows:\n\n*\"Possession must be transferred by delivery of the thing; or delivery of the means of control over the thing to the transferee; or when the transferee gains the right of control over the thing with the previous owner\u2019s consent\".*\n\n391.\n\nArticle 570 of the Turkish Commercial Code states as follows:\n\n*\"All commercial paper will be accepted as bearer shares as long as it is clear from the text or format of the paper that the possessor is the one who is entitled to the rights relating to the share\".*\n\n392.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that, only after delivery of the bearer share certificates to the transferee, can the transferee claim rights *vis-\u00e0-vis* the company or a third party. In this regard, it cites Article 415 of the Turkish Commercial Code: *\"Transfer of bearer shares to the holder can have effects*  *vis-\u00e0-vis* *the company and third parties only after their delivery\".* It further agrees that the transferee lacks actual ownership (including the right to defend against third parties who might claim ownership of the share certificates) until such time as delivery occurs.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that the possession of the share certificates themselves is sufficient proof of delivery to Libananco and hence also proof of Libananco\u2019s ownership in respect of those share certificates. According to the Claimant, this is because the question of whether delivery had been accomplished under Turkish law is a question that was bifurcated to the merits phase of this arbitration (on the basis that if it were to be unable to prove its ownership of *all* the share certificates it claimed to own, this would simply reduce the amount of damages it would be entitled to recover). The Claimant therefore submitted that the fact of Libananco\u2019s possession of a substantial number of *bona fide* share certificates (acquired before 12 June 2003) was sufficient to demonstrate ownership for the purpose of establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction - regardless of how they were acquired, including whether there was a valid transfer of possession or *teslim* under Turkish law. Its position on this point is set out more fully in paragraphs 146 above.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s position on** ***teslim***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position was follows.\n\n394.1 Article 415 of the Turkish Commercial Code (which the Claimant agreed was applicable) provides: *\"Transfer of bearer share certificates is enforceable*  *vis-\u00e0-vis* *the company and the third parties only upon delivery thereof\u2019.*\n\n394.2 Bearer share certificates are a type of negotiable instrument and are therefore also subject to Article 599/1 of the Turkish Commercial Code: *\"For the transfer of a negotiable instrument for the purpose of creating ownership or another real right, transfer of possession of the instrument is compulsory in any event\".*\n\n394.3 A bearer share certificate is movable property and Article 763/1 of the Turkish Civil Code provides as follows: *\"Transfer of possession is required for transfer of ownership of movables\".*\n\n394.4 In accordance with these provisions, the Claimant must prove that the share certificates were delivered and that there was a transfer of possession.\n\n394.5 Article 973/1 of the Turkish Civil Code defines possession as follows: *\"A person who has physical control over something is the possessor thereof\u2019.* Accordingly, delivery or *teslim* may only be accomplished by handing property from the transferor to the transferee physically.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis on the requirement of** ***teslim***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nArticle 763 of the Turkish Civil Code states provides as follows: *\"Transfer of possession is required for transfer of ownership of movables\".*\n\n396.\n\nArticles 973/1 of the Turkish Civil Code defines a possessor as the person who has physical control over the property in question (see paragraph 394.5 above). Article 977 of the Turkish Civil Code further state as follows:\n\n*\"Possession will have been transferred upon delivery to the acquirer of the property or the instruments that will confer control over the property or when the acquirer becomes capable of exercising control over the property with the consent of the former possessor\".*\n\n397.\n\nThe Respondent cited a Turkish treatise, Poroy, Tekinalp and Camoglue, *Law of Companies and Cooperatives (Ninth Edition)* (Exhibit H-448), which states as follows:\n\n*\"1113.*  ***For the purposes of transfer, possession must be passed with the intention of transferring ownership.***  *BSC is bearer negotiable instrument in the real sense. \"Transfer [...] is enforceable vis-\u00e0-vis the company and third parties only upon delivery thereof\u2019 (Turkish Commercial Code Art. 415).*  ***That is to say, for passing ownership,*** ***possession of the certificate must be transferred with such intention.*** *We can set out the necessary conditions as follows: 1) Possession must be transferred from the transferor to the transferee: For this, it is not compulsory to become an immediate possessor, but acquisition through an agent, constitutum possesorium, assignment of right to possession and delivery by short hand is also possible;*  ***2) Transfer of possession must be made with the purpose of passing \u2018ownership\u2019 to the transferor [sic] and the parties must have agreed thereon.***  *Although such agreement is not mentioned in Article 763 of Turkish Civil Code, in the civil law doctrine, it is stated that the agreement is essentially inherent in the transfer of possession. (Oguzman/Selici, Esya Hukuku (Law of Properties, p. 645 and those cited therein). This is because,*  ***unless a person acquires something with the intention of becoming the owner thereof he does not become the owner.***  *Moreover, Turkish Commercial Code expressly provides for this factor. In Article 599/1 of [the] Turkish Commercial Code, it is stated as \"...transfer of a negotiable instrument for the purpose of creating ownership...\" 3)*  ***The person passing the possession must be authorized to transfer the ownership. This is the rule. In principle, those lacking such authority cannot transfer ownership to others...\"***\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n398.\n\nBased on the above authorities, the Tribunal arrives at the following conclusions.\n\n398.1 A transfer of possession is required for the transfer of ownership of the bearer share certificates. Until such time as a transfer of possession occurs, the purported transferee is not the owner of the property in question, and consequently would not be entitled to claim against third parties in respect of the property.\n\n398.2 Since a transfer of possession is required for the transfer of ownership of property, the bare fact of possession (without more) is insufficient to establish ownership over the property in question.\n\n398.3 Physical control is the crux of possession.\n\n398.4 It follows that the person purporting to transfer ownership needs to have physical control over the property in question in the first place. If the transferor does not have physical control over the property at the purported time of transfer, there cannot logically be a transfer of possession.\n\n398.5 However, it is not necessary for either the transferor and/or the transferee to be immediate possessors of the property sought to be transferred. Each of the following is deemed to constitute a legal transfer of possession:\n\n(a) transfer of possession through an agent (i.e. where the agent transfers or acquires possession on behalf of the transferor or transferee, as the case may be);\n\n(b) an assignment of the right to possession (i.e. in a situation where immediate possession is exercised by a third party, the transferor, as the indirect holder of the property, assigns his claim for return or surrender of the property to the transferee; alternatively, the transferor directs the third party to exercise possession for the benefit of the transferee; the transferee thereby becoming the new indirect holder of the property, even though immediate possession has not changed);\n\n(c) *constitutum possessorium* (i.e. where the delivery of the property proceeds on the basis that the transferor and transferee agree that the transferor will continue to hold the property for and on behalf of the transferee); and\n\n(d) delivery by short hand (i.e. delivery by consent between the transferor and transferee in the case where the transferee has prior possession of the property).\n\n398.6 In respect of the means of transfer of possession set out in paragraphs\n\n398.5 (a) and (b) above, the Tribunal observes that, under Turkish law, indirect possession (i.e. through an agent or third party) and therefore a transfer of indirect possession would be recognised as valid. In other words, it is possible for possession to change by a direction of the owner to his agent or a third party (i.e. the immediate possessor of the property) to exercise immediate possession of the property for the benefit of the transferee (or the transferee\u2019s agent).\n\n398.7 However, in all cases, possession must be passed with the intention of transferring ownership in order to effect a valid transfer of possession or *teslim.*\n\n398.8 For the reasons given above, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s submission that the mere fact of physical possession of the bearer share certificates (at the material time) was sufficient to demonstrate its ownership. The burden is on the Claimant to prove that there was a *transfer* of possession to Libananco before 12 June 2003 of the share certificates it now claims to own.\n\n399.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant has to prove both *when* and *how* it came to acquire possession and hence ownership of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates in question. Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s submission, this is properly an issue to be addressed in the current phase (i.e. the jurisdictional phase) of this arbitration.\n\n***H. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis on whether Libananco acquired timely ownership of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factual and expert evidence, the Tribunal now delivers its findings in relation to the various issues relevant to the question of whether Libananco acquired timely (i.e. before 12 June 2003) ownership of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n**1. The reasons given by Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan for their choice of Mr T\u00fcrkkan to acquire Libananco**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nCem Uzan explained at length the reasons for the creation of Libananco -amongst other things, this was to consider his Immediate Family\u2019s future investment strategy in relation to concerns about the Turkish economy as well as the possibility of political reprisal as a result of his decision to enter Turkish politics in early 2002 with the intention of challenging the ruling party. Mr T\u00fcrkkan was chosen to set up Libananco because he was *\"a sophisticated, multi-lingual businessman\"* and *\"a trusted business associate\".*\n\n402.\n\nHakan Uzan added that Mr T\u00fcrkkan was a trusted senior executive who had personally worked for him for some five years prior to his acquisition of Libananco.\n\n403.\n\nOn the Claimant\u2019s case, Mr T\u00fcrkkan played a central role in matters relating to the acquisition of Libananco and its acquisition of interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n404.\n\nHowever, the picture of Mr T\u00fcrkkan that emerged was quite different. The Respondent produced an e-mail message from Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s supervisor, who referred to him in less than flattering terms and recommended that his salary be halved. Although the Claimant\u2019s witnesses Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan spoke highly of Mr T\u00fcrkkan in their Witness Statements, they were unable to rebut the fact that Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s salary was cut by half following a recommendation to that effect from his supervisor.\n\n405.\n\nHaving observed Mr T\u00fcrkkan in person, the Tribunal did not find him to be the worldly, sophisticated business person that the Claimant\u2019s witnesses Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan had represented him to be. For example, when the Tribunal asked Mr T\u00fcrkkan how he came to choose, on an internet directory, Mr Partellas\u2019 firm over other listed firms, his reason was that this was because Mr Partellas\u2019 firm was on the top of the list. The Tribunal also observes here that Mr T\u00fcrkkan changed his evidence; he deposed in his First Witness Statement that he located Mr Partellas through *his* website. However, Mr Partellas did not have a website until late in 2002. Mr T\u00fcrkkan then changed his evidence to say that he found Mr Partellas on an internet directory.\n\n406.\n\nThe evidence relating to Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s experience, qualifications and abilities (as well as his demeanour and evidence at the hearing) did not support Cem Uzan\u2019s and Hakan Uzan\u2019s choice of him as a person capable of the duties expected of someone entrusted with the establishment and management of a new offshore company and the acquisition and transfer of investments of several billion dollars. This casts some doubt on the plausibility of the Claimant\u2019s account of how Libananco was acquired or otherwise established and subsequently came to acquire shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n**2. Mr T\u00fcrkkan's alleged visit to Cyprus in early April 2002 to undertake work in connection with Libananco**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nMr Partellas testified that he first met Mr T\u00fcrkkan sometime around 1 April 2002 in the lobby of the Cyprus Hilton in Nicosia. This meeting is significant as it is central to Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s alleged acquisition of Libananco in April 2002. One of the pillars on which the foundation of the Claimant\u2019s case rests is that Libananco was acquired by Mr T\u00fcrkkan by way of an Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002.\n\n408.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to consider the issue of whether this alleged meeting in fact took place.\n\n409.\n\nBy way of background, the Tribunal notes that it has been alleged by the Claimant that Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s passport for the relevant period was in the possession of the Turkish authorities. However, this is denied by the Respondent. In any event, the Tribunal did not have the benefit of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s passport as evidence before it on this important issue. Accordingly, the Tribunal must base its decision on all the other evidence available on the record.\n\n410.\n\nThe natural starting point is Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s First Witness Statement where he deposed that he first flew to Cyprus in early April 2002 *\"on a non-stop Royal Jordanian flight from Amman and stayed two nights at the Nicosia Hilton*\n\n**a) The Parties\u2019 submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe Parties relied on numerous documents in relation to this issue. These are set out and described below, together with the Tribunal\u2019s and/or the Parties\u2019 observations (where applicable) on each of them.\n\n411.1 The Respondent submitted a letter from one Mr Stephen Humphreys, Vice President and Senior Counsel of the Legal Department of Hilton International Co. dated 2 September 2009 (Exhibit H-121). That letter stated as follows:\n\n*\"a person known as Ali T\u00fcrkkan stayed at the [Hilton Nicosia Archbishop Makarios III Avenue Nicosia 1516 Cyprus \"Hilton Nicosia \"] on the following dates (all inclusive) 9th November 2005 to 11th November 2005; 25th November 2005 to 26th November 2005; and 29th March 2006 to 1st April 2006.... However, we have no record of any person known as Ali T\u00fcrkkan having stayed at the Hotel in April 2002\".*\n\nAt the hearing in November 2009, the Claimant challenged this letter on the basis that it did not specifically state that Mr T\u00fcrkkan did not stay at the Hilton Nicosia in April 2002. On 10 March 2010, the Respondent\u2019s Turkish counsel Mr Aydin Cosar wrote to Mr Humphreys to request confirmation that the Hilton Nicosia possessed records of guests who stayed at that hotel in April 2002, and that these did not include any record of Mr T\u00fcrkkan having stayed at the Hilton Nicosia in April 2002 (Exhibit R-1015). On 16 March 2010, Mr Humphreys replied to Mr Cosar confirming that his understanding was correct (Exhibit R-1016).\n\n411.2 The Claimant submitted a letter (printed on Royal Jordanian letterhead) from Mr Moh\u2019d Hashem Murtada (whose designation was the Head of Airport Services Department) dated 1 October 2009 (Exhibit C-242). That letter purported to confirm that Mr T\u00fcrkkan was a passenger on board a Royal Jordanian flight from Amman, Jordan to Lamaca, Cyprus on 1 April 2002:\n\n*\"We have consulted our records and can confirm that Mr Turkkan was a passenger on a RJ flight from Amman to Lamaca Cyprus on 1 April 2002 and took a return flight back to Amman on 3 April 2002. For security reasons, we cannot share with you the internal records confirming this information\".*\n\n411.3 The Claimant submitted another letter (also printed on Royal Jordanian letterhead) dated 22 October 2009 from the same Mr Murtada (Exhibit C-269). Attached to that letter was a report which listed the travel records of Mr T\u00fcrkkan from 2002 to 2004. Those entries purported to show, among other things, that he left Jordan for the Republic of Cyprus on 1 April 2002 at 9.10 a.m, and returned to Jordan on 3 April 2002 at 11.17 p.m.\n\n411.4 The Respondent submitted a letter dated 4 November 2009 from Mr Hani Kurdi, Legal Advisor at Royal Jordanian (Exhibit R-910). This letter referred to Exhibits C-242 and C-269 above (see paragraphs 411.2 and\n\n411.3 above). Mr Kurdi stated in his letter that: (i) both those documents were neither issued nor authorised by Royal Jordanian; and (ii) contrary to what was stated in Exhibit C-242, Royal Jordanian did not operate a flight on 1 April 2002 to Lamaca, Cyprus. However, Mr Kurdi wrote again on 11 November 2009 to clarify that there was indeed a *\"Flight to Lamaca via Beirut (RJ flight number 401) as a special (non-regular) flight\"* on 1 April 2002, and further that Exhibit R-910 (i.e. his earlier letter) should be *\"disregarded\"* as the information there was based primarily on Royal Jordanian\u2019s table of scheduled operations, which did not show special (i.e. unscheduled) flights (Exhibit C-271). Attachment 2 to this letter indicated that Royal Jordanian Flight 401 departed Amman, Jordan at *\"1755\".*\n\n411.5 Following from Exhibit C-271 (which stated that the Royal Jordanian flight on 1 April 2002 from Amman to Lamaca was via Beirut), the Respondent requested information from the Rafic Hariri International Airport (\"Beirut Airport\") through a Lebanese judge on 11 March 2010 (Exhibit R-1017). On 16 March 2010, Mr Daniel El Haibi, the President of the Beirut Airport replied as follows (Exhibit R-1018):\n\n*\"We certify that the named Ali Cenk Turkkan or whatever similar name does not appear in the list of passengers who were on board flight 401 of the Royal Jordanian Airline from Amman to Beirut on the 1st of April 2002 which landed in the [Beirut Airport] at 18:50 GMT\".*\n\n411.6 In October 2009, the Respondent submitted what purported to be immigration records of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s various visits to Cyprus (Exhibit R-893). This letter was signed off: *\"ANDREAS LEONIDOU... LIEUTENANT\"*. The earliest entry indicated that Mr T\u00fcrkkan visited Cyprus from 11 November 2004 to 17 November 2004. The Claimant submitted a letter dated 31 October 2009 written by the same Mr Leonidou (whose designation appeared as the Inspector at the Aliens & Immigration Office of the Republic of Cyprus) stating that Exhibit R-893 (i.e. the earlier document signed by him): *\"[did] not constitute an official document of the Republic of Cyprus.... The entries into computers which relate to arrivals and departures of aliens in the Republic are of a confidential nature\"* (Exhibit C-270).\n\n411.7 The Claimant submitted a letter dated 11 November 2009 from one Mr Mohammad Qutashat, Director, Queen Ali Airport Border Control, Airport Police Management Office, Jordan which purported to confirm that one *\"Ali Cenk Turkkan... Turkish Nationality... passport number 991491\"* departed from Queen Ali Airport (\"Amman Airport\") on 1 April 2002 for Lamaca, Cyprus and returned to Amman Airport from Lamaca on 3 April 2002 (Exhibit C-272). According to Mr Qutashat\u2019s letter, Mr T\u00fcrkkan *\"departed through us [i.e. Queen Ali Airport Border Control] on April 1st 2002 to Lar naca at 19:35:20 and on April 3rd 2002 arrived from Lar naca at 9:28:41\".*\n\n411.8 In the R.PHM, the Respondent submitted that the evidence in Exhibit C-269 contradicted that in Exhibit C-271. Specifically, Exhibit C-269 stated that Mr T\u00fcrkkan left Amman on 1 April 2002 at 9.10 a.m, but Exhibit C-271 purported to show that Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s departure from Amman took place at 5.55 p.m. The Claimant\u2019s response was that this could have been a transcription mistake.\n\n**b) The Tribunal\u2019s analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nBased on the evidence considered at paragraphs 411.1 to 411.8 above, the Tribunal finds that it has not been rebuhed by either Party that Royal Jordanian in fact operated a special (i.e. non-regular) flight from Amman to Lamaca via Beirut on 1 April 2002 (\"RJ Flight 401\").\n\n413.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a significant portion of the documentary evidence set out in paragraphs 411.1 to 411.8 above is conflicting. The Tribunal is thus unable to make any finding, based solely on the documentary evidence above, as to whether Mr T\u00fcrkkan was on board RJ Flight 401 on 1 April 2002.\n\n414.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that the evidence set out below has probative value in relation to the issue of whether Mr T\u00fcrkkan travelled to Cyprus on 1 April 2002 to undertake work in connection with Libananco. These are as follows. Where applicable, the Tribunal\u2019s findings are also recorded below.\n\n414.1 Exhibit H-9 purported to show that a meeting of Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors took place in Nicosia on 1 April 2002. Mr T\u00fcrkkan, Mr Partellas and Mr Sarris were all recorded as being present. Although Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed in his First Witness Statement that he participated in this meeting by telephone, he gave evidence to the contrary when he was cross-examined. He testified that there was in fact no actual meeting (whether by telephone or otherwise) and that it was a *\"paper meeting\"*. This about turn in Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was corroborated by Mr Partellas\u2019 testimony that no such meeting actually took place on a 1 April 2002. Mr Sarris likewise confirmed that his employees did not attend any such meeting. Whilst not offering any determinative conclusion, this contradiction of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence by himself and two of the Claimant\u2019s other witnesses brings into question the reliability of his evidence that he was in fact in Cyprus on 1 April 2002.\n\n414.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan testified that he stayed at the Hilton Nicosia on 1 April and 2 April 2002. When he was shown correspondence from Hilton International which stated that it had no record of a person known as *\"Ali T\u00fcrkkan\"* staying at the Hilton Nicosia on those dates, his response was: *\"I\u2019m not Ali Turkkan, sir... I\u2019m Ali Cenk T\u00fcrkkan\".* The Tribunal did not find this explanation persuasive and is thus unable to accept Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s testimony that he stayed at the Hilton Nicosia in April 2002.\n\n414.3 Only two of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses were able to testify that Mr T\u00fcrkkan was in Cyprus on 1 April 2002. These were Mr T\u00fcrkkan himself and Mr Partellas.\n\n414.4 Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed in his First Witness Statement that he flew on a Royal Jordanian flight **\"non-stop\"** from Amman, Jordan to Cyprus on 1 April 2002. However, the evidence before the Tribunal is that Royal Jordanian operated only one flight from Amman to Cyprus on 1 April 2002, and that flight had a stopover in Beirut, Lebanon. When confronted with this fact, Mr T\u00fcrkkan testified that it was a **\"non-stop\"** flight because he *\"didn\u2019t get out from the plane\"* when it landed in Beirut. The Tribunal does not find this explanation persuasive and is likewise unable to accept Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence on this point. The Tribunal further observes that the President of the Beirut Airport authority did not find Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s name on the list of passengers on board RJ Flight 401, which flew from Amman to Beirut on 1 April 2002 (see paragraph 411.5 above).\n\n415.\n\nFor the reasons given in paragraph 414 above, the Tribunal has doubts as to whether Mr T\u00fcrkkan travelled to Cyprus on 1 April 2002 to undertake work in connection with Libananco (and its alleged acquisition of the shares in question). On the other hand, certain aspects of the evidence presented by the Claimant indicate that Mr T\u00fcrkkan travelled to Cyprus in April 2002. Therefore, the Tribunal will determine this issue based on a consideration of the other evidence on the record.\n\n**3. The other circumstances surrounding Mr T\u00fcrkkan's alleged purchase of Libananco in April 2002**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe other aspects of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s involvement in the purchase of Libananco in April 2002 are naturally also key pillars of the Claimant\u2019s case. In that regard, the Tribunal found the following pieces of evidence probative. Where applicable, the Tribunal\u2019s observations are also set out below.\n\n416.1 Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed in his First Witness Statement that he was able to locate Mr Partellas\u2019 firm through its website in March 2002. However, when he was cross-examined, Mr T\u00fcrkkan changed his evidence to say it was not actually Mr Partellas\u2019 firm\u2019s website that he found, but rather a website containing a directory or list of accountants and law firms in Cyprus. He explained that he chose Mr Partellas\u2019 firm because its name or Mr Partellas\u2019 name was at the top of that list. The Tribunal cannot accept the account given by Mr T\u00fcrkkan of how Mr Partellas\u2019 firm came to be selected.\n\n416.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan said that Mr Partellas\u2019 firm provided their services to him on credit and on trust before Mr Partellas received payment from him (after some three years) at the end of 2005. This seems unlikely, given that: (i) accountants normally ask for a payment on account from new clients before undertaking work on their behalf; (ii) Mr T\u00fcrkkan himself said that he had not met Mr Partellas prior to 1 April 2002; and (iii) Mr Partellas also needed to involve a third party in the establishment of Libananco, i.e. Mr Sarris. For these reasons, the Tribunal does not accept Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s testimony here.\n\n416.3 Mr Sarris was unable, to produce the invoice or receipt relating to Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s alleged purchase of Libananco from Prontoservus (a company associated with Mr Sarris\u2019 law firm) in April 2002. Mr Sarris first testified that there would have been an invoice, but upon further cross-examination, he testified that there might not have been one because Mr Partellas had a current account with his office. Mr Sarris ultimately said that he did not produce the records evidencing the sale of Libananco because no one had asked him to do so. He explained that he did not know the subject maher of the present proceedings. Considering that Mr Sarris is a trained and experienced ahomey, the Tribunal does not find this explanation satisfactory.\n\n417.\n\nFor the reasons given at paragraph 416 above, the Tribunal has doubts as to whether Mr T\u00fcrkkan in fact purchased Libananco in April 2002 and will return to a conclusion on this issue based on a consideration of the other evidence on the record.\n\n**4. The alleged trust arrangement in respect of Libananco**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant alleged that, although Libananco was acquired by Mr T\u00fcrkkan on behalf of the Uzan family in April 2002, it was beneficially owned by Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family.\n\n419.\n\nHakan Uzan specifically confirmed that he had asked Mr T\u00fcrkkan to set up Libananco and to hold the company on trust for members of his family. However, he admitted that there were no documents to record or otherwise evidence the alleged trust arrangement.\n\n420.\n\nWhilst giving oral testimony, Hakan Uzan also wavered when asked to list the alleged beneficial owners of Libananco pursuant to this trust arrangement. He did not give any concrete answer when asked whether Libananco was held on trust for just him and his brother Cem Uzan, or also for Kemal Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan. Instead, he clouded the issue by saying that there was no clear answer to that question because of the \"family divorce\" in the background.\n\n421.\n\nHakan Uzan also said that the terms of the alleged trust arrangement were never communicated to Mr T\u00fcrkkan, so it was impossible for Mr T\u00fcrkkan to know who the beneficiaries of the alleged trust were. He even went so far as to admit that it would be impossible to prove the existence of the trust if Mr T\u00fcrkkan were to meet with an unfortunate accident. His evidence was corroborated by Mr T\u00fcrkkan, who said that he was not told about the terms of the alleged trust.\n\n422.\n\nThe Tribunal was not persuaded by the evidence that there was a trust arrangement in respect of Libananco in favour of Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family, and subsequently in favour of Cem Uzan alone after the alleged \"family divorce\" took place. In any event, the Tribunal does not consider that the evidence presented by the Claimant to support the \"family divorce\" to be persuasive for the reasons set out in paragraphs 460 to 465 below.\n\n423.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove the existence of any trust in respect of Libananco.\n\n**5. Instrument of Transfer dated 1 April 2002**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the Claimant to show that this document was created and/or executed on 1 April 2002.\n\n425.\n\nThis aspect of the Claimant\u2019s case was similarly riddled with inconsistencies, and the Claimant\u2019s witnesses gave conflicting evidence on this point.\n\n426.\n\nFirst, even though Mr T\u00fcrkkan claimed he was in Cyprus on 1 April 2002, he said that he did not sign the Instrument of Transfer on that day. He swung from saying (on the one hand) that the document was not ready for him to sign, to suggesting (on the other hand) that the document was ready to sign but he did not sign it then because he wanted to *\"preserve\"* the original document. Mr Partellas agreed that the Instrument of Transfer was in fact not signed on 1 April 2002, but he was unable to give any convincing reason for this.\n\n427.\n\nMr T\u00fcrkkan himself admitted that the Instrument of Transfer produced in this arbitration was reprinted and signed by him in 2007. However, he was unable to give any explanation as to the provenance of the reprinted Instrument of Transfer, which he said contained the signature of Mr Sarris and of the witness for his (i.e. Mr Sarris\u2019) signature.\n\n428.\n\nMr Sarris\u2019 evidence is also relevant here, since his company (or a company associated with his law firm) Prontoservus, which provided corporate secretarial services, is alleged to have transferred all of the shares in Libananco to Mr T\u00fcrkkan. Although Mr Sarris deposed in his Witness Statement that he personally signed the Instrument of Transfer on behalf of Prontoservus on 1 April 2002, he subsequently changed his evidence, and said (in direct examination) that he did not in fact sign that document. Rather, it was signed by his employee, Mr Starvos Ktorides. When questioned on this, he expressed surprise at his own Witness Statement.\n\n429.\n\nIn any case, his evidence that the Instrument of Transfer was signed on 1 April 2002 has little or no weight since (by his own admission) Mr Sarris testified that he had no independent recollection that the Instrument of Transfer was signed on that date other than by looking at the date printed on the document itself. He testified that he presumed the document was signed on that date.\n\n430.\n\nLibananco was allegedly sold to Mr T\u00fcrkkan through Mr Partellas\u2019 firm, but Mr Sarris did not produce an invoice written out to Mr Partellas\u2019 firm or to any other entity. He said that he did not produce this invoice because no one asked him to look for it. His explanation was that he did not know anything about this arbitration other than that he had to give evidence.\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Mr Sarris\u2019 evidence as presented unreliable. At the hearing, he disavowed the gist of his Witness Statement, which was that he personally signed the Instrument of Transfer on 1 April 2002. He could not explain why he signed a Witness Statement that was inaccurate in several material aspects.\n\n432.\n\nThere is therefore no proof that the Instrument of Transfer (or any version of it) was in fact signed in April 2002, and, indeed, that it was signed at any time before 2007.\n\n**6. The failure of the Claimant and its witnesses to comply with the necessary legal requirements under Cypriot law in connection with the transfer and operation of Libananco**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nIt is relevant to observe at this juncture that Cem Uzan deposed that there was no public disclosure (to the Turkish or Cypriot authorities) of Libananco\u2019s acquisition of interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez until 2005. He said that this was done to maintain confidentiality, and that Mr T\u00fcrkkan was so instructed. In that regard, the Tribunal observes, for the reasons given below, that notifications, filings and other legal procedures required under Cypriot law (in relation to the transfer and operation of a company in Cyprus) were not complied with by the Claimant and/or its witnesses.\n\n434.\n\nFirst, Mr Partellas confirmed that Libananco\u2019s accounts had to be filed annually, within a year from the end of the previous financial year. According to him, Libananco\u2019s accounts for 2002, 2003 and 2004 were only filed in 2007.\n\n434.1 He agreed that the accounts should have been filed earlier, but did not give any convincing explanation why this was not done. The best evidence he could give was that the filings were *\"probably\"* delayed because of his instructions from Mr T\u00fcrkkan to do so. He also said it was common practice in Cyprus to delay such filings. Having regard to its overall impression of Mr Partellas\u2019 evidence, the Tribunal did not find this to be a satisfactory explanation.\n\n434.2 It is also uncertain whether audited accounts were prepared contemporaneously for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 when there was no intention to fde them promptly. As stated in paragraph 254.3 above, Mr Partellas rendered no bills from 2002 to 2005, so no contemporaneous documentary evidence exists of such work having been done in those years.\n\n435.\n\nSecond, on the issue of the legal requirement under Cypriot law for Libananco to have filed a notification of change of its directors, Mr Sarris agreed that any change would have to be registered in the Registry of Companies within fourteen days.\n\n435.1 In Libananco\u2019s case, however, Mr Partellas admitted that this was only done in 2005. His evidence in this regard was also inconsistent as he initially denied that there was any time limit for filing that notification.\n\n435.2 Mr Sarris said that the notification of change of directors was typically not delayed in other cases, but he left the responsibility to do so to Mr Partellas in this case since Libananco was sold through Mr Partellas\u2019 firm. Considering that Mr Sarris\u2019 own employees would have remained on the record as directors of Libananco (and would be potentially liable as such) if this change was had not been registered, the Tribunal does not find Mr Sarris\u2019 explanation to be credible.\n\n436.\n\nThird, the Respondent submitted that, in 2002 (the year in which Libananco was allegedly acquired by Mr T\u00fcrkkan), it was illegal under the Cypriot Exchange Control Law (\"ECL\") for a non-resident such as Mr T\u00fcrkkan to acquire shares in a Cypriot company without permission from the Central Bank; nor could shares in Libananco have been acquired on behalf of non-resident beneficial owners, such as the Uzans, without such permission. The Respondent cited Article 11(1) of the ECL as being the relevant legal provision.\n\n436.1 The Respondent asserted that if the Cypriot Central Bank had granted permission for Mr T\u00fcrkkan to acquire Libananco (on behalf of the Uzan family), then it would necessarily have done so by issuing a license converting Libananco from an ordinary Cypriot company (which could only be owned by residents of Cyprus) into an \"international business company\" (\"IBC\"). However, the distinction between IBCs and domestic companies, together with the attendant licensing requirements, were eliminated from 2004 onwards by the introduction of legislative amendments.\n\n436.2 The Respondent submitted that there was no evidence on the record to show that Mr Turkkan applied for permission from the Cyprus Central Bank pursuant to Article 11(1) of the ECL, or that Libananco was otherwise licensed as an IBC.\n\n436.3 The Claimant\u2019s witness Mr Partellas appeared to suggest that the necessary licence and/or permission was not necessary since the regulatory requirements pursuant to the ECL were relaxed prior to Cyprus\u2019 accession to the European Union. However, in re-direct examination, Mr Partellas stated that the relaxation of regulatory requirements only began in *\"late 2003\".* On that basis, the Tribunal does not accept Mr Partellas\u2019 evidence that the above permission and/or licenses were not required in connection with the acquisition of Libananco by Mr T\u00fcrkkan in April 2002.\n\n437.\n\nAll the significant omissions described above rendered Mr Partellas\u2019 role as the corporate secretary of Libananco suspect. These discrepancies gave the impression that work on Libananco began only in 2005 (or later). The Claimant has not proved that Mr Partellas, or indeed any of the other individuals alleged to have been involved in the acquisition and running of Libananco (including Mr Turkkan), commenced work for and/or in relation to Libananco in 2002.\n\n**7. Was Libananco acquired by Mr Turkkan on 1 April 2002?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal is unable to reconcile the Claimant\u2019s case with the evidence given by its witnesses. The Claimant was also unable to produce documents which would normally be expected to exist if its story were true. As stated at paragraph 115 above, the Claimant bears the burden of proof on the main issue of whether it acquired timely ownership of the shares in question. Based on its combined observations and findings at paragraphs 412 to 415, 423, 432 and 437 above, the Tribunal finds the following to be improbable.\n\n(a) That Mr Turkkan travelled to Cyprus on 1 April 2002 for the purpose of undertaking work in connection with Libananco (and its alleged acquisition of the shares in question).\n\n(b) That Libananco was acquired by Mr Turkkan on 1 April 2002 or early April 2002.\n\n439.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove the occurrence of the facts it has alleged as stated in paragraphs 438 (a) and (b) above. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant\u2019s case is only that Libananco was purchased in April 2002. The Claimant has not submitted evidence as to the acquisition of Libananco by Mr Turkkan (or any other individual) at any other time, nor does any such argument form part of its case.\n\n**8. Exhibit R-821 and the issue of dividends**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Exhibit R-821 was a fax sent by Hakan Uzan\u2019s secretary to him on 14 July 2003 which sets out the family\u2019s ownership interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. The Respondent obtained this document as a result of ongoing SDIF activity following from the imar Bank fraud, pursuant to which the SDIF legally assumed supervision of Telsim, the Uzans\u2019 mobile phone company. As a result, the SDIF was able to gain access to Telsim\u2019s computer servers. Exhibit R-821 was found on those servers.\n\n441.\n\nExhibit R-821 appeared on its face to be a document that shows a breakdown of the Uzan family\u2019s shareholding in various companies. Hakan Uzan, in his Witness Statement, vigorously disputed the authenticity of that document on various grounds.\n\n442.\n\nExhibit R-821 appeared to comprise of two e-mail messages.12 The same two documents were both attached to each of those e-mail messages. The first attachment was entitled *\"History.txt\"*.13 Also attached (although it was not clear from the hard copy of the tendered exhibit whether this was part of the file *\"History.txt\")* was an eleven page list in tabular form in English of each of the Uzans\u2019 shareholdings in various companies.\n\nThe first e-mail message was from a sender named ***\"Fax Server\"*** to what appeared to be ***\"Nilufer Baser -[illegible text] Telsim\".*** The subject of the first e-mail message was: ***\"A new 11 page fax has arrived from\",*** dated 14 July 2003, 8.50 pm. Three minutes later, that e-mail message (including both its attachments) was forwarded by the same ***\"Nilufer Baser -[illegible text] Telsim\"***  to Hakan Uzan.\n\nThis was a record of an automatic forward by ***\"[ARSVCI]\"*** upon receipt to ***\"Nilufer\\_Baser\"*** and ***\"Yuksel\\_Yucel\".***\n\n443.\n\nThat tabular list in Exhibit R-821 showed the following:\n\n443.1 Hakan Uzan owned 6.01 per cent of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and 0.43 per cent of the shares in Kepez;\n\n443.2 Cem Uzan owned 8.56 per cent of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and 9.89 per cent of the shares in Kepez;\n\n443.3 Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan owned 4.69 per cent of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and 5.32 per cent of the shares in Kepez;\n\n443.4 Kemal Uzan owned 47.62 per cent of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and 42.52 per cent of the shares in Kepez; and\n\n443.5 Yavuz Uzan (Hakan Uzan\u2019s uncle) owned 0.19 per cent of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and 2.3 per cent of the shares in Kepez.\n\n444.\n\nThese figures were in most cases almost identical to the dividend percentages that each Uzan family member received in May 2003. This was confirmed by the Depository Bank Report, which was prepared by the Depository Bank in response to a request by the General Directorate of Energy Affairs of the Ministry to analyse the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates in Switzerland and Vienna as well as those seized by the SDIF. The Depository Bank is a Turkish institution that provides share certificate settlement and custody services.\n\n445.\n\nSpecifically, paragraph 42 of the Depository Bank Report was a table that showed the members of the Uzan family whom were the recipients of the dividends paid by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to their respective shareholders in May 2003. The table reported the individual shareholding of each member of the Uzan family in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez based on the nominal value of their shareholding (which was in turn calculated by examining the share certificates that were presented for the collection of dividends) calculated as a percentage of the total share capital of the company.\n\n446.\n\nThe figures which represented the individual shareholding of each member of the Uzan family in paragraph 42 of the Depository Bank Report (calculated based on the May 2003 dividend) were identical to the tabular list in Exhibit R-821.\n\n447.\n\nHowever, the Claimant submitted that the dividends received by members of the Uzan family did not bear any relationship to their actual respective shareholdings in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n447.1 Cem Uzan deposed that the share certificates and the dividend coupons were separate bearer instruments and that the dividend coupons in respect of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates had been detached prior to the transfer of interests to Libananco.\n\n447.2 Hakan Uzan also gave evidence to the effect that actual ownership of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez was not in any way related to the dividends claimed in 2003. Rather, it was agreed between members of the Uzan family who would claim the dividends (and in what proportion). In that regard, Hakan Uzan deposed that, as part of the alleged \"family divorce\", it was agreed that his father Kemal Uzan would receive the largest share of the dividends of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in 2003 as part of the consideration for relinquishing his interest in certain companies to be owned by Cem Uzan and Hakan Uzan.\n\n448.\n\nThere is substantial evidence to the contrary.\n\n448.1 It was not recorded in any of Libananco\u2019s minutes who was supposed to have received the dividends that would be paid to shareholders of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. This was a significant and telling omission in view of the fact that Libananco was alleged to have conducted no business other than the acquisition of interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. Mr Turkkan was unable to give any explanation for this omission.\n\n448.2 Although Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was asked to draft the template STA which was allegedly used by Libananco, he was not instructed that the dividend coupons would be retained by the transferors (i.e. members of the Uzan family). He agreed that the STAs on their face purported to show that the transferee (i.e. Libananco) would receive the shares together with all rights and benefits, including the right to receive the corresponding dividends. There was similarly no explanation for this discrepancy.\n\n448.3 Share certificates representing 83 per cent of the total share capital of Kepez (Series 1 through 6) had no dividend coupons for the 2002 dividend year. A letter from Kepez to Adabank employee Mr Ulusoy dated 16 May 2003 (Exhibit H-175) stated, among other things, that:\n\n*\"There are no more dividend coupons for 2002 attached to 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., and 6. Series share certificates... The main bodies of these certificates will be stamped as \"DIVIDEND FOR 2002 PAID\" and the payment will be made against the receipt enclosed herewith\".*\n\nAccordingly, with respect to certificates representing 83 per cent of Kepez\u2019s total share capital, there was nothing to detach and nothing that could be exchanged for a dividend payment. To receive a dividend, the owner of the share certificate would have had to present the certificate itself for stamping. Even with respect to the limited number of Kepez share certificates that had coupons for the dividend paid in May 2003 (the Series 7 certificates), there was evidence that Kepez had a standing policy that shareholders could not claim dividends by presenting a dividend coupon alone, but rather were required to present the certificate along with the coupon. A letter from Kepez to one Mazlum Ercan dated 21 January 2003 (Exhibit H-988) stated that: *\"Without the share certificates, no action can be taken with regard to the share certificate dividend coupons you have sent, and they are hereby returned to you\".* According to the Depository Bank Report, members of the Uzan family collected dividends from Kepez corresponding to some 63.46 per cent of the total shareholding in Kepez in total.\n\n448.4 In respect of \u00c7EA\u015e, dividends for the 2002 dividend year were paid out in two instalments: the first on 20 May 2003 and the second on September 19, 2003.14 Since \u00c7EA\u015e share certificates had only one 2002 dividend coupon, the first instalment was paid upon presentation of \"rights coupon no. (5)\" and the second instalment upon presentation of the 2002 dividend coupon.15 Libananco produced a number of \u00c7EA\u015e share certificates in Vienna that still had \"rights coupons no. (5)\" attached -these certificates represented approximately 35 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e.16 All the \u00c7EA\u015e share certificates located in Switzerland (subsequently seized by the Swiss authorities) also had \"rights coupons no. (5)\" attached - these certificates represented a further 25 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e.17 In total, share certificates representing some 60 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e were found to have had \"rights coupons no. (5)\" attached. According to the Depository Bank Report, individual members of the Uzan family collected dividends corresponding to some 67.07 per cent of the total shareholding of \u00c7EA\u015e.\n\nSee paragraph 9 of the Depository Bank Report.\n\nSee Exhibit H-274, the Istanbul Stock Exchange Daily Bulletin No. 90 of 14 May 2003.\n\nSee paragraph 68 of the Depository Bank Report.\n\nSee paragraphs 24 to 25 of the Depository Bank Report.\n\n449.\n\nFor the reasons set out at paragraphs 448.1 to 448.4 above, the Tribunal is unable to accept the evidence of the Claimant\u2019s witness Cem Uzan that dividends in respect of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez were paid to the holders of the dividend coupons (which had allegedly been detached from the share certificates) and not the holders of the share certificates themselves.\n\n450.\n\nIn the light of the persuasive evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant\u2019s submission that the dividends paid by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to members of the Uzan family had no correlation with their respective shareholdings prior to Libananco\u2019s alleged acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n451.\n\nThe figures in Exhibit R-821 are further supported by Cem Uzan\u2019s contemporaneous financial disclosures of 23 October 2002, 20 February 2003 and 6 March 2003, where he declared that he owned 8.56 per cent of \u00c7EA\u015e capital and 9.9 per cent of KEPEZ capital (see Exhibits H-138, H-151 and IT-154). In addition, according to Adabank\u2019s records of dividend payments made in prior years, the dividends that Cem Uzan received in the period 1999 to 2003 corresponded to practically identical shareholding percentages (see Exhibit IT-1135).\n\n452.\n\nThe Tribunal is cognisant that the table showing the breakdown of shareholding in Exhibit R-821 is undated. However, the Tribunal considers that this does not detract from the suggestion that Exhibit R-821 shows that individual members of the Uzan family (and not Libananco) owned a majority interest in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez at *some point in time.*\n\n453.\n\nWhilst Hakan Uzan disputed the accuracy of this document as at 14 July 2003, he admitted it would have been accurate at an earlier date, thus accepting (by necessary implication) that the 20 May 2003 dividend payment corresponded to the Uzan family members\u2019 individual ownership interests at some point in time. This was in effect an admission that the payment of dividends to individual members of the Uzan family was in fact proportionate to their respective shareholdings in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez at some point in time. Hakan Uzan therefore contradicted his own evidence in his Witness Statement that the payment of dividends was not linked to each family member\u2019s shareholding in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence in relation to the authenticity of Exhibit R-821 to be credible.\n\n454.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore not persuaded by Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence that Exhibit R-821 was not an authentic document. It is pertinent to note the provenance of Exhibit R-821 (which the Claimant has not rebutted). This was a document recovered from the computer servers of a company controlled by the Uzans, containing information that was either personal to the Uzan family or confidential in nature; it was therefore likely to have been created by a person closely connected to the Uzan family. In the light of the Tribunal\u2019s observation at paragraphs 443 and 444 above, and all the other evidence on the record, the Tribunal finds that it is more probable than not that Exhibit R-821 evidences the respective shareholdings of the individual members of the Uzan family in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez at or around 20 May 2003, including the period leading up to 12 June 2003 (it is relevant to note, in this regard, that on the Claimant\u2019s own case, no transfer of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates was alleged to have taken place after 20 May 2003).\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that Exhibit R-821 is likely to be an authentic document.\n\n456.\n\nBased on Exhibit R-821, the Tribunal is of the view that members of the Uzan family owned shares corresponding to 67.07 per cent of the total shareholding in \u00c7EA\u015e and 63.46 per cent of the total shareholding in Kepez during the period in question (i.e. from 20 May to 12 June 2003). This is ultimately irreconcilable with Libananco\u2019s alleged ownership of 65.2 per cent of the total shareholding in \u00c7EA\u015e and 60 per cent of the total shareholding in Kepez before 12 June 2003.\n\n**9. The alleged \"family divorce\"**\n-----------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is that there was a \"family divorce\" which occurred over the approximate period October 2002 to May or June 2003. It was said that, pursuant to the \"family divorce\", there was a consolidation in the various shareholdings within the Uzan family and it was agreed that, among other things, Cem Uzan would become the sole beneficial owner of Libananco.\n\n458.\n\nThe \"family divorce\" alleged by the Claimant is of more than peripheral relevance. The Respondent argued that based on dividend records (on the assumption that dividends received by each shareholder corresponded to their respective individual shareholdings), Hakan Uzan owned far less of \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s shares than that which he allegedly transferred to Libananco, and that the same was true in relation to the \u00c7EA\u015e shares which Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan allegedly transferred to Libananco. The Claimant\u2019s response to this was that, as part of the \"family divorce\", intra-family agreements were entered into; as a result of which Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan acquired significantly larger interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez18 than was the case before the \"family divorce\". The Claimant\u2019s case is that these shares were then transferred to Libananco (by Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan) in April and May 2003 (i.e. when the alleged acts of *teslim* were said to have occurred).\n\nBut only Hakan Uzan (and not Aysegul Uzan) acquired shares in Kepez as a result of these intra-family agreements.\n\n459.\n\nIf there was in fact no \"family divorce\" that occurred along the lines suggested by the Claimant\u2019s witnesses, this brings Libananco\u2019s alleged acquisition of the shares of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez into question since the burden would then be on the Claimant to demonstrate the source of the shares allegedly acquired by Libananco (i.e. the identity of the sellers or transferors).\n\n460.\n\nConsidering also that the \"family divorce\" was said to have taken place between October 2002 to May or June 2003, and that Cem Uzan gave evidence to the effect that the \"family divorce\" was intended to achieve a split of both ownership and control, Kemal Uzan\u2019s continued involvement in certain day to day issues relating to \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez remains unexplained by the Claimant. Significantly, Kemal Uzan was involved in dealing with the central issue of the cancellation of the Concessions Agreements. This is inconsistent with the Claimant\u2019s contention that Cem Uzan acquired ownership (through Libananco) and control of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez pursuant to the \"family divorce\".\n\n461.\n\nFurther, as late as June 2003, Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan even incorporated a new company together. This does not appear to be consistent with the occurrence of a \"family divorce\" earlier that year.\n\n462.\n\nThe purported intra-family transactions were also far from clear.\n\n462.1 Hakan Uzan said that, although he was not the majority shareholder in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in 2002, he sold the largest quantity of shares to Libananco in 2003 because there was an \"intermediate\" movement of shares within that period.\n\n462.2 These transactions were conducted in a roundabout manner with no satisfactory explanation for the manner in which the transactions were structured. For example, shares were purportedly transferred to Hakan Uzan by Kemal Uzan, Cem Uzan and Ayseg\u00fcl Uzan, only for him to later transfer those shares to Libananco.\n\n462.3 The manner in which the transfers were carried out also did not make sense considering that, on the Claimant\u2019s own case, it had by that time been decided that Cem Uzan would own all the family\u2019s shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. If the intra-family transactions are treated as genuine (i.e. actually having occurred) then one has to believe that Cem Uzan transferred shares to Hakan Uzan, who in turn transferred those shares to Libananco (allegedly beneficially owned by Cem Uzan by that time) - a full circle, so it seems.\n\n462.4 Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence (in his Witness Statement) was that the transactions were so structured because each had (or was intended to have) a *quid pro quo* counterpart in another transaction involving another company in which members of the Uzan family had shares in common. However, there was no evidence of any such practice. Hakan Uzan also deposed that the transactions were so structured for political reasons, i.e. so that Cem Uzan would not be seen transferring shares to a Cypriot company. The Tribunal likewise did not find this explanation persuasive. No sensible reason has otherwise been put before the Tribunal to explain the convoluted and roundabout nature of the intra-family transactions.\n\n462.5 It is also telling that Cem Uzan admitted that (as a leader of a political party) he would have had to file financial disclosures in respect of material changes in his assets if and when the said intra-family transactions were executed. But he was unable to give any satisfactory explanation why this was not done.\n\n463.\n\nIn addition, the circumstances surrounding the alleged intra-family transactions remain ambiguous. No evidence has been given to show how the alleged intrafamily transfers took place. In particular, the Claimant has maintained its silence on the issue of how *teslim* was accomplished in respect of the transfer of the underlying share certificates. Although the Claimant has produced the intrafamily agreements which were allegedly used, the Tribunal has found (at paragraph 371 above) that the metadata in respect of the electronic versions of those documents was not conclusive of the date on which they were created. Further, the intra-family agreements would, on their own, have no legal effect, since the other requirements for a valid transfer of ownership (e.g. *teslim)* have not been demonstrated.\n\n464.\n\nFurther, the intra-family agreements were of questionable provenance. They appeared as deleted files on Mr Turkkan's floppy disks (subsequently produced in these proceedings). The appearance of those floppy disks remains a mystery. Mr T\u00fcrkkan was questioned on this in cross-examination but the Tribunal did not find any of his explanations to be satisfactory. On the one hand, he said that he saved these documents because he thought they were important; on the other hand, he also said that he deleted them subsequently, as he assumed they were sent to him by mistake. Curiously, he gave no explanation as to how those documents came into his possession.\n\n465.\n\nSignificantly, the intra-family agreements were the only documents that the Claimant produced to evidence the occurrence of the alleged \"family divorce\".\n\n466.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal does not find the \"family divorce\" as put forth by the Claimant to be persuasive. Accordingly, the Claimant has failed to explain the following:\n\n(a) how Hakan Uzan came to acquire a substantial interest in \u00c7EA\u015e that would have enabled him to transfer shares corresponding to 35.53 per cent of its total share capital to Libananco when (according to dividend records as of 20 May 2003) he only owned shares corresponding to 6.04 per cent of its total share capital;\n\n(b) how Hakan Uzan came to acquire a substantial interest in Kepez that would have enabled him to transfer shares corresponding to 44.08 per cent of its total share capital to Libananco when (according to dividend records as of 20 May 2003) he only owned shares corresponding to 0.43 per cent of its total share capital; and\n\n(c) how Aysegul Uzan came to acquire a substantial interest in \u00c7EA\u015e that would have enabled her to transfer shares corresponding to 17.48 per cent of its total share capital to Libananco when (according to dividend records as of 20 May 2003) she only owned shares corresponding to 4.69 per cent of its total share capital.\n\nFor the above analysis, the Tribunal has calculated the percentage of the shareholding in each company allegedly transferred to Libananco by individual members of the Uzan family by identifying the transferors or sellers in each of the STAs and then adding up the percentages for each individual transferor or seller (across the various STAs allegedly executed by him or her) in respect of each company.\n\n**10. The Share Transfer Agreements**\n-------------------------------------\n\n467.\n\nThe STAs were a central feature of the Claimant\u2019s case.\n\n468.\n\nEarly on in these proceedings, the Claimant submitted that the STAs were effective to transfer ownership of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Libananco on various dates between October 2002 and May 2003 (i.e. the respective dates on the face of the STAs). However, the Claimant subsequently admitted that the STAs were, without more, insufficient to effect a transfer of ownership unless *teslim* was also accomplished. Accordingly, its present position is that the STAs were entered into merely to memorialise the intent of the individual transferors to transfer their shares to Libananco.\n\n**a) The earlier version of the Claimant\u2019s case was that the share transfer agreements were effective to transfer ownership of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n469.\n\nMr\u00a0\u00c7i\u011fgin deposed that Cem Uzan had asked him to prepare model agreements or template STAs for Libananco for use in connection with its intended acquisition of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. This was consistent with Cem Uzan\u2019s evidence in his Witness Statement that Libananco acquired those shares over the period October 2002 to May 2003. Mr Partellas had the same understanding because he gave evidence to similar effect.\n\n470.\n\nHakan Uzan\u2019s evidence that the transfers were to be completed in tranches as a matter of business practice in the Uzan family suggests that the STAs were intended to effect a legal transfer of the shares. In that regard, he was responsible for deciding the quantity of shares in each company (i.e. \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez) that would be transferred to Libananco at any particular time, and by whom. Hakan Uzan went further to say that these individual transactions would be closely monitored by the Shareholder Services Department of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n471.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin agreed that the STAs purported on their face to be documents intended to be used instruments for an actual transfer of ownership of the shares.\n\n472.\n\nThe sum of the above evidence is that the STAs were intended to effect legal transfers of the shares in question.\n\n473.\n\nThis is consistent with the initial version of the Claimant\u2019s case, i.e. that Libananco: (i) acquired ownership of interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez over the approximate period October 2002 to May 2003; (ii) acquired its first shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in November 2002 and October 2002 respectively; and (iii) made its last acquisitions in May 2003.\n\n473.1 The underlying premise of the Claimant\u2019s case was that Mr T\u00fcrkkan acquired Libananco on behalf of Cem Uzan and his Immediate Family in April 2002, and that they remained the beneficial owners of Libananco.\n\n473.2 In relation to the transactions described above, Mr T\u00fcrkkan allegedly prepared a Share Acquisition Report dated 20 May 2003 (Exhibit H-61), which shows the breakdown of individual acquisitions as having occurred between 30 October 2002 and 15 May 2003.\n\n473.3 Libananco\u2019s board minutes, purportedly dating from 2002 and 2003, also recorded the transactions described above as having been executed in the same range of dates.\n\n473.4 These pieces of evidence are all consistent with the initial version of the Claimant\u2019s case that the STAs themselves were legally effective to transfer ownership of the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez on various dates between October 2002 and May 2003. However, as described earlier, the Claimant has departed from its initial position. The evidence set out above is therefore not only meaningless in the light of the Claimant\u2019s abandonment of its initial position, but is also contradictory to the Claimant\u2019s current position.\n\n**b) The Claimant\u2019s subsequent change of position**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n474.\n\nThe present version of the Claimant\u2019s case may be outlined as follows.\n\n474.1 In his Second Witness Statement, Cem Uzan deposed that, in accordance with the alleged \"family divorce\", the Uzan family divided its assets among Kemal Uzan, Hakan Uzan and himself, and agreed, in particular, that he would receive the family\u2019s stake in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez and would therefore become the sole beneficial owner of Libananco. Consequently, the beneficial ownership of Libananco changed in January 2003.\n\n474.2 Cem Uzan deposed that, as a result of the alleged \"family divorce\", his relations with his father Kemal Uzan and brother Hakan Uzan became increasingly strained. For that reason, he considered it was important that the members of his Immediate Family memorialise their intention to irrevocably surrender their ownership interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Libananco to avoid potential disputes in the future.\n\n474.3 Following January 2003 therefore, STAs continued to be executed to memorialise the intent of the members of his Immediate Family to transfer their shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez to Libananco.\n\n474.4 The necessary implication of this (which the Claimant accepted) was that the STAs had no legal significance in the sense that they did not effect any legal transfer of interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez. The Claimant has therefore shifted its case to say that the transfers of ownership in respect of the shares took place only when *teslim* in relation to the share certificates occurred in April and May 2003.\n\n475.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the two main versions of the Claimant\u2019s case described and elaborated upon above contradict each other in material aspects, and that the Claimant\u2019s witnesses were unable to give any convincing explanation for this significant change of position.\n\n**c) The share transfer agreements reflected that \"cash\" was paid by Libananco for the purchase of the shares**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nIt was recorded on the face of the STAs that *\"cash\"* would be given as consideration by Libananco in return for the transfer of shares. Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence was that, if the unfortunate events of 12 June 2003 had not happened, Libananco would have settled this debt eventually and would have made payment to the individual transferors or sellers.\n\n477.\n\nHowever, Hakan Uzan was unable to maintain his evidence in cross-examination. When questioned, he said instead that his father Kemal Uzan would not be paid by Libananco for the transfer of shares to Libananco. He explained that Kemal Uzan received, in exchange for the transfer of shares to Libananco, an especially large dividend, subsequent to which there would be no further monies due (from Libananco) to him.\n\n478.\n\nHakan Uzan was also unable to explain why (assuming there was indeed a debt recorded in Libananco\u2019s books in favour of the sellers of the shares) the 2003 financial statements of Libananco recorded a US$ 234 million debt that was owed to Mr Turkkan (who did not transfer any shares to Libananco).\n\n479.\n\nThese were yet further discrepancies for which no satisfactory explanation was given by the Claimant.\n\n**d) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on the share transfer agreements**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nThe reason for the creation of the STAs is suspect as the evidence of Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin (who allegedly drafted the template STA), when taken as a whole, was not coherent on this point.\n\n480.1 Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin deposed that, when he was asked to draft the template STA in 2002, it was only intended to memorialise each transferor\u2019s intent to effect the respective transfers. His evidence was that, in September 2002, he advised Cem Uzan on the requirements under the Turkish Commercial Code for a legally effective share transfer; namely that STAs would not be necessary to accomplish the planned transfer.\n\n480.2 But yet he admitted in cross-examination that the template STA which he prepared purported on its face to be an instrument to effect the transfer of legal ownership of the shares as such, i.e. the STAs themselves would be capable of bringing about a legally effective transfer of ownership.\n\n480.3 Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was unable to explain why he prepared a template STA in that manner when his evidence was that the template STA which he prepared was intended (in accordance with his advice to Cem Uzan on the requirements for a legally effective transfer of ownership) only to memorialise each transferor\u2019s intent in relation to the shares.\n\n480.4 Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin also testified in cross-examination that he received no instructions from Cem Uzan as to whether the template STA was intended to be used as an instrument to effect the actual transfer of ownership of shares as such, or whether its purpose was merely to memorialise the intent to do so on the part of each transferor or seller. This does not explain or clarify Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's otherwise contradictory evidence.\n\n480.5 The Tribunal did not find Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's evidence on this issue persuasive.\n\n480.6 The Tribunal further observes that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence that the template STA was intended only to memorialise each transferor\u2019s intent to transfer ownership of the shares inconsistent with the earlier version of the Claimant\u2019s case that the execution of the STAs themselves was intended to effect a legal transfer of ownership in respect of the shares.\n\n481.\n\nFurther, although the STAs were said by the Claimant to have been created and executed in 2002 and 2003, the evidence that has emerged casts considerable doubt on this.\n\n481.1 Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence that Libananco\u2019s acquisition of shares was specifically structured to be carried out in tranches is meaningless in the light of the Claimant\u2019s change of position (i.e. the Claimant eventually submitted that the transfer of ownership occurred pursuant to acts of *teslim* and not by way of execution of the STAs). This renders both the reason(s) for the creation of the STAs and the time at which they were created suspect.\n\n481.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence was that he would often receive several signed STAs in a bundle (suggesting that they had all been signed at the same time) and that sometimes he would not receive a particular document back at all, and would have to create a new one. This is difficult to reconcile with Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence that the transfer of shares was meant to occur in a structured manner.\n\n481.3 In 2009, the Claimant produced the hand stamp that it alleged was used to apply the Libananco company seal to the STAs. It was only when the Respondent pointed out that this hand stamp was of a \"Shiny\" model which could not have been purchased before 2005 that the Claimant submitted Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s Second Witness Statement, in which he deposed that there had been an earlier hand stamp that had broken in transit. Mr T\u00fcrkkan said that it was indeed this earlier hand stamp (which has, to date, not been produced) that had been used to stamp some of the STAs.\n\n481.4 Crucially, Mr T\u00fcrkkan said that all of the STAs produced in this arbitration were printed in 2005 because some documents were missing and some were not readable.\n\n481.5 Mr T\u00fcrkkan further admitted that some of the STAs could have been stamped in 2005. His evidence was corroborated by Mr Partellas, who deposed in his Second Witness Statement that Mr T\u00fcrkkan *\"may have\"* used the new stamp machine on some documents in November 2005.\n\n482.\n\nLibananco\u2019s Share Acquisition Report dated 20 May 2003 (Exhibit H-61), is related to the STAs since its entries correspond to the information contained in the individual STAs. This was therefore a document intimately connected with the STAs themselves. The Claimant has no choice but to accept that the entries in Exhibit H-61 are not accurate, since it subsequently submitted that *teslim* only occurred in April and May 2003 (whereas Exhibit H-61 purported to show Libananco\u2019s acquisition of shares from October 2002 onwards). It follows that Exhibit H-61, even on the Claimant\u2019s own case, is not an authoritative or accurate document. The Claimant has not given any satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy, which serves only to further discredit the STAs.\n\n483.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the STAs were likely to have been created on the dates that appear they bear.\n\n**11. Libananco\u2019s board and management minutes**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nThere were likewise a number of indications that Libananco\u2019s board and management minutes were not likely to have been created on the dates that they bore.\n\n485.\n\nTo begin with, Mr T\u00fcrkkan (who claimed to be responsible for the preparation of Libananco\u2019s minutes) was unable to explain some of the English terms used in the minutes. At one point in the cross-examination, he even asked if he could consult a dictionary. This brings into doubt his evidence that he personally drafted the minutes.\n\n486.\n\nMore importantly, Mr T\u00fcrkkan changed his evidence dramatically when, having deposed in his First Witness Statement that the corporate meetings of Libananco took place over the telephone, he later testified that there were in fact no telephone calls, and therefore (by necessary implication) that those purported meetings were in fact not attended by anyone at all. This was corroborated by Mr Partellas\u2019 evidence which was to the effect that none of his employees (who were nominee directors in Libananco) attended any of Libananco\u2019s corporate meetings - they merely signed the minutes after they were prepared by Mr T\u00fcrkkan. The sum of Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s and Mr Partellas\u2019 evidence was therefore that none of the meetings reflected in Libananco\u2019s minutes actually occurred as was alleged by Mr T\u00fcrkkan in his First Witness Statement; rather, they were all paper meetings.\n\n487.\n\nThere were also tell-tale signs that, contrary to what the minutes purported to show, those documents were not likely to have been prepared in 2002 and 2003.\n\n488.\n\nAlthough Libananco\u2019s Minutes of Directors\u2019 Meeting of 23 September 2002 (Exhibit El-13) purported to record the appointment of Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin as Libananco\u2019s legal advisor, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin testified that he was unaware of that appointment and, in fact, had never been asked to provide such a a service. Even if he had provided any legal advice in relation to Libananco to either Hakan Uzan or Cem Uzan, there was no proof of this - Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin did not have any notes, letters, e-mail messages or other records to document his involvement in the present case.\n\n489.\n\nIn the Minutes of Libananco\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Meeting of 10 July 2002 (Exhibit H-ll), it was recorded that *\"PARTELLAS KILLIARIS LTD\"* would be appointed as Libananco\u2019s auditors. However, Mr Partellas testified that he only formed a limited company in 2005. He explained this was a simple mistake that anybody could have made. In the light of all the other available evidence, the Tribunal did not find his evidence here persuasive.\n\n490.\n\nSignificantly, Mr Turkkan testified that he *\"reprinted\"* all of Libananco\u2019s minutes in 2005. Those were the only versions of the minutes produced in this arbitration. Although the Claimant alleged that the original documents remained in existence or had existed at some earlier point in time, none of those originals were produced and no satisfactory explanation was given for their absence.\n\n491.\n\nTaking into consideration all the evidence as set out above on this point, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the minutes are likely to have been created on (or around) the dates that they bear.\n\n**12. Was legal ownership of the share certificates of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez in istanbul validly transferred to Libananco by 12 June 2003?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nThis is the linchpin of the Claimant\u2019s case. The Claimant fails on the present jurisdictional issue if it is unable to establish that it acquired ownership of the share certificates before 12 June 2003.\n\n**a) Were the share certificates located in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings wrapped in brown paper and labelled \"Libananco\"?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nThe starting point must be the act which, in the Claimant submission, constituted *teslim* in relation to the share certificates in istanbul.\n\n494.\n\nThe Claimant submitted that certain share certificates which belonged to members of the Uzan family and were destined for Libananco were stored in the Rumeli and Dogus buildings in istanbul. The intent of the transferors to have those shares transferred to Libananco was signified by the wrapping of the share certificates in brown paper and labelling them with the name \"Libananco\". On that basis, the Claimant contended that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's inspection of the share certificates on 15 May 2003 on behalf of Libananco (coupled with the wrapping and labelling of the share certificates which signified the intent of the transferors) was sufficient to accomplish *teslim,* consequent upon which the ownership in the shares so inspected passed to Libananco.\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal has assumed (without deciding) for the purposes of the present analysis that the method outlined above (i.e. the wrapping of the share certificates in brown paper and subsequent labelling) would, under Turkish law, be factually sufficient to demonstrate the intention of the transferors to transfer ownership of the share certificates to Libananco. The findings below proceed on this basis.\n\n496.\n\nOn this issue, the evidence of Messrs Ulusoy, Sirin, Bozkurt and G\u00fcner is relevant. The Tribunal makes the following observations and/or findings.\n\n496.1 The Claimant\u2019s witness Mr Ulusoy gave evidence that the share certificates in the Rumeli Building were indeed wrapped in brown paper on 23 March 2004 and that the *\"name of a foreigner\"* was marked on the packaging. However, no weight has been accorded to Mr Ulusoy\u2019s Witness Statement for the reasons given in paragraph 335 above.\n\n496.2 Mr Bozkurt only visited the Rumeli and Dogus from January 2005 onwards, more than one and a half years and therefore a substantial period of time after the date in question (i.e. 15 May 2003). Accordingly, his evidence that the share certificates were not packaged in March 2004 was hearsay (i.e. not direct or firsthand testimony which could be tested by cross-examination). It is therefore not admitted in the circumstances since there was direct testimony from Messrs Sirin and G\u00fcner on the same issues.\n\n496.3 Mr Sirin confirmed that he had no part in the attachment procedures in the Rumeli Building, but that he was on the second floor of the Dogus Building on 29 March 2004 where he saw \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates (which he deposed were not wrapped or otherwise packaged).\n\n496.4 Mr G\u00fcner was the only one of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses who testified that he was present at both the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings on 23 March and 30 March 2004 respectively. Although he deposed that he saw no wrapping around the share certificates in the basement of the Rumeli Building, he admitted in cross-examination that he did not look through all of the steel cabinets at that location. Mr G\u00fcner gave little elaboration in relation to his observations at the Dogus Building.\n\n497.\n\nAssuming (but not deciding) that the evidence of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses on this point is accepted, this only establishes the state of some (but not all) of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings as at March 2004, some nine months after the date in question (i.e. 15 May 2003). Further, in the light of the observations set out in paragraph 496 above, the Tribunal is unable to make a positive finding, based only on the evidence given by the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, that there were no \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates wrapped or packaged in brown paper and marked \"Libananco\" in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings as at March 2004. However, this is ultimately of no moment since it is the Claimant which bears the burden of proof on this issue.\n\n498.\n\nSince Mr Ulusoy\u2019s evidence has been given no weight in these proceedings, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence (i.e. that the share certificates were wrapped in brown paper and marked \"Libananco\") determines the Tribunal\u2019s findings on this issue. For the reasons given at paragraph 504 below, the Tribunal does not find Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s overall account of the events of 15 May 2003 to be persuasive. Accordingly, there was no satisfactory evidence from the Claimant that the share certificates were so packaged and labelled other than the bare assertion of Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin, which was otherwise uncorroborated by facts on the record.\n\n499.\n\nThe Claimant has therefore failed to show that, on 15 May 2003, the share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings were wrapped in brown paper and labelled \"Libananco\". For that reason, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant\u2019s submission that the immediate possessors of the share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings were holding the share certificates with instructions and/or the intention to deliver those share certificates to Libananco for the purpose of effecting a transfer of ownership to Libananco. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the immediate possessor of those share certificates did not have the authority and hence the right to deliver the latter to Libananco.\n\n**b) Mr** **\u00c7i\u011fgin's alleged inspection of the share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings in Istanbul**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n500.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence here is critical to the Claimant\u2019s case since he was the only witness who attested to the inspection of the share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings on 15 May 2003. The Claimant\u2019s position stands or falls on his evidence.\n\n501.\n\nBefore coming to Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence on the alleged inspection, the Tribunal observes that certain aspects of the Claimant\u2019s evidence more generally are not consistent with the case it has put before the Tribunal. The following are examples.\n\n501.1 The Minutes of the Libananco Management Committee Meeting dated 18 April 2003 (Exhibit H-52) stated that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was to *\"appoint a two lawyer team to... actually physically recheck the storage of the shares, and the labeling [sic] of the storage under the name of Libananco... on a routine basis (once a month)\".* However, there was no evidence that any two-lawyer team was ever established, nor that any routine checks were ever planned or executed, other than the alleged inspection on 15 May 2003 for the purposes of accomplishing *teslim.*\n\n501.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan deposed in his First Witness Statement that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was instructed to *\"re-check the storage of the shares and their labeling [sic] under Libananco\u2019s name... and conduct an inventory\".* But there was no evidence that such re-checking ever took place, let alone that a written inventory was ever established or maintained by Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin.\n\n501.3 Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin himself confirmed that, in early 2003, he had a telephone conversation with Mr T\u00fcrkkan during which he was instructed by Mr T\u00fcrkkan that *\"the Share Certificates needed [sic] be checked at least once a month as long as they were stored in that facility\".* There was similarly no evidence that such monthly checks were ever planned or executed.\n\n502.\n\nIt is surprising that Mr\u00a0\u00c7i\u011fgin (an experienced Turkish attorney) did not keep any record of the share certificates that he was alleged to have inspected. He did not have any record of the serial numbers of the share certificates that were allegedly inspected and admitted that the entire process was undocumented.\n\n503.\n\nMr \u00c7i\u011fgin explained that, at the time of the alleged inspection, he was in possession of the inventory of share certificates that were to be inspected (the inventory not being one he created on his own, but rather a document that was sent to him by someone else whom he did not identify). However, he testified that he destroyed that list because he did not want anyone to see it. There was no evidence that such a document existed at any point in time other than Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s uncorroborated oral testimony.\n\n504.\n\nThere were other parts of Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's evidence that the Tribunal found unpersuasive.\n\n504.1 He did not know who was responsible for the storage of the share certificates which he had allegedly inspected. This reinforces the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion at paragraph 499 above that the Claimant has failed to prove that the person(s) responsible for the storage of the share certificates had the authority and hence the right to transfer possession to Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin (since the Claimant was unable to identify such person(s) in the first place).\n\n504.2 Based on Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence, there was no indication that he acted on Libananco\u2019s behalf to assume possession of the share certificates on 15 May 2003 (e.g. by way of transporting the share certificates to another destination or by otherwise assuming constructive possession); on the contrary, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence was that he did no more than to perform a visual or physical inspection of those share certificates.\n\n504.3 Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was unable to explain in a satisfactory manner how, after the large denomination share certificates representing more than 45 per cent of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez respectively were counted and moved out of the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings on 15 May 2003 (the date of his alleged inspection), the remainder of the small denomination (and hence bulky) share certificates were counted by 16 May 2003 (the date of the share custody invoices in respect of the latter). Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s explanation as to how the smaller denomination share certificates were accurately counted in such a short time was not persuasive for the following reasons.\n\n(a) Although Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin testified that the counting of the small denomination share certificates could have been done in a short time because the packages had information about the share certificates contained within, he testified that his own inspection on 15 May 2003 (which did not involve the counting of share certificates), required some seven or eight hours.\n\n(b) Since the share certificates that were said to have remained in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings were those with small denominations (and hence were more voluminous and bulky), it would have taken a significantly longer time to count those share certificates.\n\n(c) The Claimant has not otherwise given any satisfactory explanation as to how the voluminous small denomination share certificates were counted in a short period of time (one day) between 15 May and 16 May 2003.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant has provided only photocopies of the share custody invoices, but not the originals for forensic examination; as a result, the Parties\u2019 document forensic experts were not able to confirm the authenticity of the share custody invoices (see paragraph 356.5 above). For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the share custody invoices purporting to reflect Libananco\u2019s ownership of 13.9 per cent of the issued shares in Kepez and 15.82 per cent of the issued shares in \u00c7EA\u015e as of 16 May 2003 is an accurate and/or authentic document.\n\n504.4 Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was unable to explain why there was no disclosure by Libananco or any of the directors of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez that Libananco had acquired substantial interests in those companies even though such disclosure was required under Turkish law (the obligation to disclose was triggered upon Libananco\u2019s acquisition of 10 per cent or more of the total share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e or Kepez). His only evidence is that he probably looked at this law when he was advising Libananco.\n\n505.\n\nNot only does Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s evidence fail to paint a complete picture of what was alleged to have occurred on 15 May 2003, it also does not helpfully explain any of the gaps in the Claimant\u2019s case. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that any inspection of the share certificates Mr\u00a0\u00c7i\u011fgin may have conducted in the Rumeli and Dogus buildings in istanbul on 15 May 2003 was on behalf of Libananco or that it accomplished *teslim* in respect of those share certificates.\n\n506.\n\nWhilst Libananco\u2019s Minutes of the Management Committee Meeting dated 18 April 2003 (Exhibit H-52) purported to demonstrate a concern by Libananco that the security of the share certificates be checked (which in turn implied prior possession by Libananco of those share certificates), it was not the Claimant\u2019s case that **teslim** in respect of the share certificates in istanbul took place at any point in time before 15 May 2003. Indeed, the Claimant did not submit any evidence to show that actual inspections (as opposed to the mere giving of instructions to Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin to inspect) of the share certificates in istanbul occurred prior to 15 May 2003, whether for the purpose of achieving **teslim** or otherwise. Accordingly, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal makes no finding as to whether any inspection (for whatever purpose) of the share certificates in istanbul took place prior to 15 May 2003.\n\n507.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant\u2019s evidence (in the form of Exhibit H-52 and oral testimony from Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin) to the effect that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin was to conduct repeated and regular inspections is inconsistent with the objective of accomplishing *teslim* since: (i) the latter is a one-time process and (ii) a mere inspection does not (without more) constitute a transfer of possession (which is the essence of *teslim).* Accordingly, it would be of no assistance to the Claimant\u2019s case even if it had been able to show that either an inspection or regular inspections took place prior to 15 May 2003.\n\n**c) Hakan Uzan\u2019s alleged inspection of the share certificates in the garage in Ikitelli, Istanbul**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nThe possibility that there was yet another act of *teslim* (i.e. in addition to those allegedly accomplished in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings in istanbul and via telephone in respect of the share certificates located in Switzerland) was mentioned for the very first time by Hakan Uzan on 23 March 2010 during his cross-examination. Hakan Uzan testified that his father Kemal Uzan called him to inform him to go to a garage in ikitelli, istanbul on 15 May 2003, where he (i.e. Hakan Uzan) accepted delivery of large denomination \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates.\n\n509.\n\nHakan Uzan had no convincing explanation why this alleged third act of *teslim,* previously unmentioned, did not appear in any of the Claimant\u2019s Witness Statements or other documents.\n\n510.\n\nWhat is most puzzling about the alleged garage *teslim* is that Hakan Uzan said that the share certificates which he allegedly inspected were only moved to the garage in ikitelli *after* Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin inspected *those very same share certificates* in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings. Accordingly, the share certificates Hakan Uzan allegedly inspected in ikitelli would have been the same as those Mr Ciggin had allegedly inspected earlier in the day.\n\n511.\n\nThis makes no sense. If *teslim* had been accomplished by Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin\u2019s inspection in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings, then Hakan Uzan\u2019s inspection of the same share certificates in ikitelli would have been redundant. The Claimant\u2019s case is contradictory.\n\n512.\n\nThere is also no documentary evidence of this alleged third act of *teslim.* In fact, there is no other evidence at all on this point except for the belated and uncorroborated oral testimony of Hakan Uzan.\n\n513.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that it is unlikely that the alleged delivery by Kemal Uzan and corresponding inspection and acceptance by Hakan Uzan in the garage in ikitelli ever took place. All of the evidence points in the opposite direction. Hakan Uzan\u2019s late introduction of this evidence into the record, in fact, undermines the Claimant\u2019s case further. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove that the events alleged by Hakan Uzan to have taken place in the garage in ikitelli on 15 May 2003 in fact occurred.\n\n**d) Conclusion on the issue of whether** ***teslim*** **in relation to the share certificates located in Istanbul was accomplished**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nThe alleged delivery of share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings and in the ikitelli Garage was attested to only by Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin and Hakan Uzan. The Tribunal did not find their evidence persuasive. Despite the crucial importance of the process of *teslim,* the Claimant was not able to produce the slightest documentary evidence to support its argument, and indeed its witnesses have admitted that the entire process was undocumented.\n\n515.\n\nFurther, the documentary evidence (see paragraph 100.1 above) introduced by the Claimant to support the initial version of its case (i.e. that the shares were acquired progressively from October 2002 to May 2003 by way of a series of separate transactions) is completely contrary to the present version of its case (i.e. that the shares were acquired by Libananco only in April and May 2003 pursuant to three acts of *teslim).* Again, the Claimant has provided no satisfactory explanation for this significant change of position.\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal summarises its findings in relation to the two acts of *teslim* which were allegedly achieved in istanbul on 15 May 2003 as follows.\n\n516.1 The Claimant has failed to show that the immediate possessor of the share certificates located in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings had the authority and hence the right to deliver the latter to Libananco (see paragraph 499 above).\n\n516.2 The Claimant has failed to show that any inspection of the share certificates Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin may have conducted in the Rumeli and Dogus buildings in istanbul on 15 May 2003 was on behalf of Libananco or that it accomplished *teslim* in respect of those share certificates (see paragraph 505 above).\n\n516.3 The Claimant has failed to show that the alleged delivery of the share certificates in the garage in ikitelli by Kemal Uzan and the corresponding inspection and acceptance of the same by Hakan Uzan in fact occurred (see paragraph 513 above).\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal returns to the requirements under Turkish law for a legal transfer of possession necessary to accomplish *teslim.* In that regard, the Tribunal refers to paragraphs 398.5 above. On the basis of its review of the evidence, the Tribunal reaches the following conclusions in relation to the share certificates located in: (i) the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings and (ii) the garage in ikitelli.\n\n517.1 In relation to (i), there could have been no transfer of possession by an agent. By reason of the Tribunal\u2019s finding in paragraph 516.1 above, the Claimant has failed to show that any alleged agent of the transferors was authorised to deliver the share certificates to Libananco. In relation to (ii), there is no evidence that Hakan Uzan was authorised to act (as an agent) on behalf of Libananco, and that Kemal Uzan was authorised to so act on behalf of all the sellers.\n\n517.2 In relation to both (i) and (ii), there was no assignment of the right to possession since there is no evidence that the transferors of the share certificates assigned their rights to claim for return of possession of the shares certificates to Libananco. There is also no evidence that the transferors instructed the immediate possessor to hold the share certificates for Libananco going forward - in the case of (i), the immediate possessor was an alleged third party whom was in any event not indentified by the Claimant; in the case of (ii) Kemal Uzan was allegedly the immediate possessor of the share certificates but there was no evidence that he was so instructed by the alleged transferors.\n\n517.3 In relation to both (i) and (ii), the question of *constitutum possessorium* does not arise since no evidence has been adduced to show that there was an agreement between the transferors and Libananco that the former would continue to hold the share certificates on behalf of Libananco even after the transfer of ownership was accomplished.\n\n517.4 In relation to both (i) and (ii), the question of delivery by shorthand likewise does not arise since the Claimant has not alleged that Libananco was in possession of the share certificates prior to its alleged acquisition of ownership (nor is there any reliable evidence on the record which might support such a factual finding). In any case, no evidence has been adduced to show that such an agreement was made between the transferors and Libananco (nor does any submission to that effect form part of the Claimant\u2019s case).\n\n518.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Claimant has failed to show that **teslim** was accomplished on 15 May 2003 in respect of the share certificates in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings and the garage in ikitelli. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal further considers that, even if the Claimant had been able to prove that Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin inspected the share certificates on 15 May 2003 in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings (which it has not), such inspection (without more) would have been insufficient to accomplish **teslim** for the reason given in paragraph 517.1 above.\n\n**13. Were the share certificates in Switzerland properly delivered to Libananco so as to effect a transfer of ownership before 12 June 2003?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nThis act of *teslim* alleged by the Claimant is a telephone call between Hakan Uzan and Mr Turkkan which took place in April 2003. The gist of the conversation was that Hakan Uzan agreed that the share certificates of \u00c7EA\u015e and/or Kepez kept in a rented property in Switzerland would now be held in custody for Libananco.\n\n520.\n\nThe Tribunal found the evidence given by the Claimant\u2019s witnesses here to be unsatisfactory.\n\n520.1 Hakan Uzan admitted that his telephone call to Mr T\u00fcrkkan was not recorded or documented in any way.\n\n520.2 Mr T\u00fcrkkan was not provided with any inventory or any other means by which he could have identified the share certificates that were supposedly being held for Libananco in Switzerland, and Hakan Uzan took no steps to evidence the share certificates in respect of which *teslim* had allegedly been accomplished in favour of Libananco.\n\n521.\n\nConsequently, neither Hakan Uzan nor Mr T\u00fcrkkan were able to identify which of the share certificates in Switzerland were (subsequent to the telephone call) allegedly held on behalf of Libananco. Hakan Uzan admitted that there was no way to physically determine which of the share certificates located in Switzerland were supposedly owned by Libananco and which were not. Logically, *teslim* could not have taken place unless the property alleged to have been delivered was certain and capable of identification.\n\n522.\n\nHowever, an even more serious weakness in the Claiman\u2019s case was Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s evidence to the effect that **teslim** had not in fact occurred in relation to the share certificates in Switzerland. Rather, he testified that **teslim** was planned, but did not ultimately occur owing to the termination of \u00c7EA\u015e' and Kepez\u2019s Concession Agreements (see paragraph 269.4 above).\n\n523.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that *teslim* could not have occurred and did not in fact occur in respect of the share certificates located in Switzerland. Any attempted delivery (of which there is little or no evidence in the first place) would not have been effective since it was impossible to ascertain which share certificates were to be delivered.\n\n**14. The share certificates produced by the Claimant for inspection in Vienna in 2009**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n524.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges, for the avoidance of doubt, that many of the high denomination \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates are presently in Libananco\u2019s possession and were delivered either by Libananco or other persons for inspection in Vienna in 2009 (see paragraph 35 above). The Claimant submitted that these share certificates were most likely to have been removed from the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings before July 2003, when the SDIF first assumed control over security in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings. If this was not the case, the high denomination share certificates would have been seized at that time by the SDIF, and the Claimant would not have been able to produce them for inspection in Vienna. The inference, according to the Claimant, is therefore that the high denomination share certificates were removed from the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings before July 2003. The Claimant submitted that this meant that it was likely that it acquired possession (and hence ownership) of those share certificates before July 2003 (see paragraph 146 above).\n\n525.\n\nHowever, these facts (even if true) are of no assistance to the Claimant.\n\n525.1 First, even if the high denomination share certificates in question were removed from the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings before July 2003, this does not show in any conclusive manner that Libananco in fact acquired possession (or ownership) of those share certificates at that time. The Tribunal considers that the logical connection between the two events is tenuous at best.\n\n525.2 Second, Libananco\u2019s *present* possession of the share certificates in question is irrelevant as the question before the Tribunal is whether the Claimant has met its case that *teslim* in respect of those share certificates occurred at the material time (i.e. before 12 June 2003). In other words, the key issue is *when* and *how* Libananco obtained possession of the share certificates in question.\n\n525.3 In that regard, the Claimant\u2019s case is that **teslim** occurred on two days: first on a certain (unidentified) day in April 2003, and on 15 May 2003. As determined by the Tribunal above, the Claimant has failed to establish the occurrence of **teslim** on those days. Libananco\u2019s ownership of the share certificates in question at any other point in time is therefore not material. It follows that the Claimant\u2019s production of approximately 50,000 \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates in Vienna for inspection in 2008 says nothing about whether Libananco owned those share certificates before 12 June 2003. The Tribunal accordingly accepts the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Claimant\u2019s possession of the share certificates in November 2008 does not prove or otherwise evidence Libananco\u2019s acquisition of those share certificates before 12 June 2003.\n\n526.\n\nThe Respondent further submitted as follows.\n\n526.1 In December 2004, the Board of Directors of \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez resolved to exchange their old share certificates for new ones denominated in the new Turkish currency. The companies announced, in the Turkish newspaper *Cumhuriyet* on 9 January 2005 (Exhibits R-502 and R-503) that, on 24 December 2004, their boards had resolved to cancel all existing share certificates and to issue new certificates denominated in the new Turkish Lira, the legal currency introduced in Turkey with effect from 1 January 2005. This new currency removed 000 000 (six zeros) from the then existing Turkish Lira.\n\n526.2 On 27 January 2005, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez advised the Turkish Capital Markets Board that the majority of their shareholders had already exchanged their old share certificates for new ones (Exhibits R-504 and R-505).\n\n526.3 In submissions to the Adana and Antalya courts, \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez repeated that *\"a large portion\"* of their shareholders had exchanged old certificates for new ones, and that the old certificates were *\"destroyed after being exchanged with new ones\"* (Exhibits R-506 and R-526).\n\n526.4 Thus, as confirmed by \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez themselves, most of their shareholders had exchanged their old share certificates in 2005, and the old share certificates were cancelled and destroyed after they were turned in by those shareholders. Yet in 2008, Libananco produced old share certificates (the Depository Bank Report showed that all of the share certificates produced by the Claimant in Vienna were denominated in old Turkish Lira, i.e. pre-currency reform) representing approximately 35 per cent of the share capital of \u00c7EA\u015e and 45 per cent of the share capital of Kepez.\n\n526.5 The Respondent submitted that the Claimant did not explain how it managed to produce substantial quantities of old (i.e. pre-currency reform) \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates for inspection in Vienna in 2008 when a majority of their shareholders had already exchanged the old share certificates for new ones (i.e. post-currency reform) in 2005.\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimant did not explain its position on this issue.\n\n528.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s submission, based on its arguments above, appears to be that the old share certificates could have been exchanged by Libananco in 2005 if Libananco had indeed owned share certificates in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez from 2003 onwards. It is observed that the facts recited by the Respondent in paragraph 526 above, even if shown to be accurate, do not conclusively prove that Libananco had not acquired the share certificates in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez before 12 June 2003. The Tribunal therefore finds that those facts (assuming, but without deciding, their accuracy) are merely suggestive that Libananco *may* not have owned the share certificates in question before 12 June 2003.\n\n529.\n\nAccordingly, in the light of the Tribunal\u2019s findings in paragraphs 518 and 523 above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not demonstrated that possession and/or ownership of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates which it produced in Vienna in 2008 was/were transferred to it at a time and in a manner which entitles it to bring a claim in the present proceedings.\n\n**15. Conclusion on whether Libananco acquired ownership of shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez before 12 June 2003**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nTaking all the evidence on this issue as a whole, the Tribunal finds the Claimant\u2019s case based on the evidence of its factual witnesses who were available for cross-examination to be highly strained and thus unpersuasive overall.\n\n531.\n\nOne striking feature of this case, underscored by the nature and magnitude of the transaction and investment in question, is the absence (even in the context of a family investment) of any form of orderly procedure designed to produce an adequate written record and compliance with the legal requirements that had to be met in order to achieve the desired factual result. Indeed, the evidence shows that even basic corporate and legal documents (many of which would be likely to exist if the facts alleged by the Claimant are true) were neither created nor retained by the persons responsible for managing or otherwise involved in Libananco\u2019s corporate affairs.\n\n531.1 Although Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence was that Mr T\u00fcrkkan was to hold Libananco on trust for certain members of his immediate family, there were no agreements or other documents (either formal or informal) to evidence and record this important arrangement. Hakan Uzan\u2019s evidence was that the terms of the trust were never communicated to Mr T\u00fcrkkan.\n\n531.2 The acts of *teslim* alleged by the Claimant to have occurred in April and May 2003 were completely undocumented, save for Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin's inventory of the share certificates located in the Rumeli and Dogus Buildings in istanbul; however, Mr \u00c7i\u011fgin testified that the inventory was later deliberately destroyed by him.\n\n531.3 Although the intra-family transactions were allegedly recorded by agreements recovered as deleted files on Mr T\u00fcrkkan\u2019s floppy disks, this was very weak evidence since the provenance of those files has not been explained in a satisfactory manner by Mr T\u00fcrkkan (or any other of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses). Furthermore, those transactions were conducted in a roundabout manner, for which there was again no convincing explanation.\n\n531.4 The intra-family transactions were allegedly carried out pursuant to the \"family divorce\", which was itself otherwise also undocumented.19\n\nSave for the STAs, which the Claimant later alleged constituted agreements of intent to transfer. The Tribunal did not find this to be persuasive evidence to support the existence of the alleged \"family divorce\" given the Claimant\u2019s significant and unexplained change of position in relation to the role and function of the STAs.\n\n532.\n\nThe failure of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses to comply with the relevant legal requirements (which could easily have been complied with) is suspect since no convincing reason for such non-compliance was forthcoming.\n\n532.1 Libananco\u2019s accounts for 2002, 2003 and 2004 were filed only in 2007, although these were required by law to be filed annually. Although Mr Partellas testified that Mr T\u00fcrkkan had asked him to delay those filings, no good reason was given for the delay. There was also no evidence that the accounts were produced contemporaneously (which would have assisted the Claimant in the circumstances if such evidence had been adduced).\n\n532.2 Cem Uzan by his own admission deposed that there was no public disclosure of Libananco\u2019s alleged investment in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez until 2005, even though the obligation (under Turkish law) to make such disclosure would have been triggered upon Libananco\u2019s acquisition of interests in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n533.\n\nThere are many evidential gaps in the Claimant\u2019s case, as well as serious discrepancies for which no satisfactory explanation has been given.\n\n533.1 There was no proof that the Instrument of Transfer was signed in April 2002 as alleged by the Claimant\u2019s witness Mr Sarris. No convincing reason was given as to why Mr T\u00fcrkkan could not have signed the Instrument of Transfer in April 2002 given that he was allegedly in Cyprus in early April 2002.\n\n533.2 Based on all the available evidence, the Claimant failed to prove that Mr T\u00fcrkkan travelled to Cyprus in April 2002 to undertake work in connection with Libananco.\n\n533.3 Exhibit R-821, which the Tribunal found to be representative of the individual shareholding of members of the Uzan family in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez as at 20 May 2003 (and also the period leading up to 12 June 2003), indicated that members of the Uzan family (and not Libananco) owned majority interests in both \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez.\n\n534.\n\nA further weakness in the Claimant\u2019s case is that there is a substantial body of unrebutted evidence that brings into question the dates of creation and/or accuracy of the key documents on which the Claimant has relied to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. For the reasons given above (at paragraphs 483 and 491 respectively), the Tribunal is unable to accept that the STAs and Libananco\u2019s minutes establish (either in part or in whole) the Claimant\u2019s case that Libananco acquired ownership of the shares in question before 12 May 2003.\n\n535.\n\nLast but not least, the Tribunal found the Claimant\u2019s significant and unexplained change of position in relation to the role and function of the STAs troubling.\n\n536.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has failed to meet its burden of proof when all the evidence is viewed as a whole. Although some of the evidence submitted by the Claimant tends to support certain aspects of its case, the Tribunal finds that, in the light of the various inconsistencies, conflicts and changes in the Claimant\u2019s account of the events that occurred, its final description and account of how it came to own shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez is not persuasive. The Claimant has therefore not discharged its burden to show positively that it had acquired, by 12 June 2003, ownership of any of the large quantity of shares in issue in the manner alleged, or at all. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not proved that it owned the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez, which represent the \"Investment\" in this arbitration, by the critical date of 12 June 2003.\n\n**X. WAS LIBANANCO AN \"INVESTOR\" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ICSID CONVENTION AND THE ECT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal having thus decided that Libananco has failed to prove that it owned, on the critical date, the shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez that formed the basis of its claims, it is not strictly speaking necessary for the Tribunal to proceed to a formal decision on the remaining three of the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections. As indicated above (at paragraph 33) the four Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections were selected by the Tribunal for hearing on the basis that they were discrete, and that each of them was capable of bringing the arbitral proceedings to an end. Once it is established that Libananco cannot be regarded as the owner of the claimed investment at the relevant time, it becomes without object to consider, for example, whether or not Libananco comes within the class of potential investors under either the ICSID Convention or the ECT, since without an \"investment\" there can be no \"Investor\".\n\n538.\n\nNevertheless, out of deference to the care with which all of the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections have been pleaded by both Parties, and in the hope that it may be of some benefit to those who have to confront these issues in future, the Tribunal adds the following brief comments on certain general issues raised by the third and fourth Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections (i.e. those set out in paragraphs 105.3 and 105.4 above respectively) which are not specific to the particular situation of Libananco. The Tribunal wishes to stress that these comments should not be regarded as having the status of formal decisions by the present Tribunal on these issues.\n\n**XI. DO LIBANANCO\u2019S CLAIMS SATISFY EXPRESS CONDITIONS OF TURKEY\u2019S CONSENT TO ARBITRATE?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n539.\n\nThe essence of the third Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection (set out in paragraph 105.3 above) is that the Turkey\u2019s consent to arbitration is lacking because Turkey is one of the Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID to the ECT as falling within paragraph (3)(b) of Article 26 of the Treaty. To be more precise, whereas paragraph (2) of Article 26 opens to an Investor of a Contracting Party three avenues for the settlement of disputes with another Contracting Party, and paragraph (3)(a) confers in that context an unconditional consent by each Contracting Party to the submission of such disputes to arbitration or conciliation, paragraph (3)(b), by contrast, limits that unconditional consent by excluding from its scope disputes which the Investor has previously submitted to the national courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party.20 The limitation is brought about by sub-paragraph (i) and applies in respect of the Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID. The provision is then completed by sub-paragraph (ii), under which *\"[f]or the sake of transparency\"* each Contracting Party listed in Annex ID *\"shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard\".* The statement is to be provided to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of the instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession by the Contracting Party concerned.\n\nOr to any other applicable dispute settlement procedure previously agreed.\n\n540.\n\nThere is no need for the Tribunal to dwell on the disagreement between the Parties as to whether - in general - compromissory clauses should be interpreted restrictively or not, since it shares the view taken by the tribunal in *RoslnvestCo UK Ltd* v *The Russian Federation (Award on Jurisdiction)* (Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Case no: Arbitration V 079 / 2005) that:\n\n*\"... the correct approach is to interpret the BIT even-handedly and objectively, on its terms, under the rules laid down in the Vienna* *Convention, and without any presumption either in favour of or against the Tribunal\u2019s own jurisdiction\".*\n\n541.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument is based on its submission that all of the Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration stem from the basic allegation that the Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Agreements was not authorised under the terms of those agreements or applicable Turkish law. This, it is said, was the very issue at the heart of the litigation pursued by \u00c7EA\u015e, Kepez, Cem Uzan (and others) before the Turkish courts. However, Turkey\u2019s acceptance of the ECT was conditioned by its inclusion in Annex ID on the basis that the Turkish Constitution prevents the recognition of arbitral awards resulting from the re-litigation of issues already decided by Turkish Courts, and this was understood and accepted by the other Contracting States from Turkey\u2019s statement of policy to the Energy Charter Secretariat in 1999 which fulfilled the requirements of Article 26(3)(b)(ii).\n\n542.\n\nThe Claimant challenges this qualification of the Turkish notification to the Energy Charter Secretariat, on the grounds both that the notification represents merely a factual account of the domestic ratification process and that it was not submitted to the Secretariat in due time, and accordingly failed to meet either of the two requirements embodied in Article 26(3)(b)(ii). The Claimant further claims that the notification refers explicitly to *res judicata,* so that on its own terms it is without legal effect unless all of the conditions for the application of the *res judicata* principle are met, specifically an identity of parties, of subject matter and of relief sought, none of which is fulfilled in the circumstances of the present arbitration.\n\n543.\n\nThe text of Article 26 of the ECT reads as follows:\n\n*\"(I) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.*\n\n*(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within the period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.*\n\n*(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting* *Party hereby gives unconditional consent to the submission of a* *dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such* *unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph 2(a) or (b).*\n\n*(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.*\n\n*(c)...\"*\n\n544.\n\nThe letter on which the Respondent relies in this context is an extensive one, the relevant part being in the following terms:\n\n*\"[under the Turkish Act of Civil Procedures (Article 237 of Law No. 1086)] if a court of law of the Republic of Turkey has adopted a decision on an issue, it has the force of final judgment on the principle of* *res judicata pro veritate habetur* *(no double jeopardy -to avoid that two judgments are issued to settle the same dispute).*\n\n*Accordingly, it would not be possible for the national courts in Turkey to recognise and enforce the awards of arbitration by the virtue of the provision of the Law No. 2675 (Article 45(b)) on \"Act on Procedure Related to Private International Law\", which regulates the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration awards in parallel with the provisions of the New York Convention (Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards) which was ratified by Turkey in 1988 by the Law No. 3731\".*\n\n545.\n\nThe disagreements between the Parties in this respect accordingly give rise (amongst others) to the following two issues.\n\n(a) Does Article 26(3)(b) of the ECT create a form of entitlement on the part of Contracting States to the ECT to avail themselves of its terms, but an entitlement which is conditional on the making of a sub-paragraph (ii) notification in proper form?\n\n(b) Should a sub-paragraph (ii) notification be regarded in law as similar or equivalent to a reservation, so that the scope and effect of its limitation of consent would depend on the content of the particular notification?\n\n546.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced, on the argument before it, that either of these two propositions is necessarily sound, as a matter of the interpretation of the ECT. It seems to the Tribunal reasonably clear that the purpose of paragraph 3(b) in Article 26 was to accept, and to incorporate into the terms of the negotiation of the ECT, that certain Negotiating States would, on becoming Party to the ECT, give only a limited consent to arbitration by comparison with the unconditional consent given by the other Contracting States. And the scope of the limitation is defined in the Article itself as excluding from that consent disputes falling within a certain descriptive category, i.e. disputes that had previously been submitted to its own courts or administrative tribunals, or to some other preagreed dispute settlement procedure. It therefore seems to the Tribunal plain, simply on the way in which Article 26(3) is drafted, both that the limited consent is foreseen and understood to take effect automatically, on the giving by the State in question of its \"consent to be bound\"21 by the Treaty, and (on the other hand) that the States covered by this provision are definitively identified, once and for all, by Annex ID itself as established at the time the ECT was concluded and opened for signature. It would then follow that the limiting effect cannot be conditional on the statement required by sub-paragraph (ii), either as to the fact of the limitation, or as to its extent; and that is indeed reinforced by the wording of sub-paragraph (ii) itself, with its express indication that the requirement is merely \"for the sake of transparency\". It seems rather to be the case that listing under Annex ID has the automatic effect of registering that the original consent of the Negotiating State in question is limited as precisely described in Article 26(3)(b), sub-paragraph (i). One may contrast with this the system set up by Article 45, which also allows individual Contracting Parties to limit their consent (in this case to provisional application of the ECT), but is clearly so constructed as to make the limitation of consent dependent on the making of the declaration provided for in its paragraph (2). As the tribunal in *Yukos* v. *Russian Federation,* Interim Award of 30 November 2009 on Jurisdiction and Admissibility *(\"Yukos\")**,* pointed out, the subjective operation of Article 45, paragraph (2), stands in direct opposition to the objective operation of paragraph (l).22 On that analysis it may be right that what we have in sub-paragraph (ii) of Article 26(3)(b) is a collateral obligation, one coupled with a specific time limit, but nothing more than that, so that whatever legal consequences might follow from any failure to comply with the collateral obligation, they would not extend to the invalidation of the listing in Annex ID itself with all that flows from that. Faced with the clear prescription that the States \"listed in\" Annex ID do not give their unconditional consent to (among other things) arbitration, it would not appear to be open to a Tribunal to go behind that listing in order to assemble some form of \"constructive consent\", so as to circumvent the fundamental rule that arbitration of any kind23 is rooted in consent to arbitrate.\n\n*Ibid.,* Articles 11 *et seq.*\n\n*Yukos,* paragraphs 282 ff.\n\ni.e. not only arbitration between an investor and a State.\n\n547.\n\nFor all those reasons, and particularly so in view of the outright prohibition on reservations contained in Article 46 of the ECT, the Tribunal does not see what warrant there would be for treating the system set up by Article 26(3) in the same way as if it were a purpose-built regime for permitted reservations to the ECT, nor therefore for applying to Article 26(3) the detailed rules pertaining to reservations under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\") or general international law. That said, the Tribunal is also conscious of the fact that the application of some aspects of Article 26(3) is not without its problems, notably (in the present context) what value should be attached to the juxtaposition of \"unconditional\" [consent] with \"its... conditions\" (where \"its\" refers to the particular Contracting State listed in Annex ID). The drafting is ambiguous as to whether, in not giving their \"unconditional consent\" the States listed in Annex ID do not give consent at all (for the situations mentioned in Article 26(3)), or whether they do in fact give a consent, but a \"conditional\" one, with the particular \"condition\" remaining to be determined on another occasion. It is conceivable that the form of drafting used was intended to leave open the possibility for individual Annex ID States to use their declarations under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) for the purpose of converting their position into one of \"conditional\" consent to arbitration etc., in which case the terms of the particular declaration would become of critical importance in defining what consent had or had not been given by the Contracting Party in question. That would appear, implicitly, to have been the assumption made by the *Yukos* tribunal.24 But the point was not fully argued either before the *Yukos* tribunal or before the present Tribunal, and the Tribunal sees no need to express any view on it.\n\nAnd appears indeed to be the basis on which both Parties proceeded before it.\n\n548.\n\nGiven the foregoing, there would, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, be no purpose in discussing further the competing arguments of the Parties in respect of the doctrine of *res judicata,* on the basis of its having been mentioned in the Respondent\u2019s statement under Article 26(3)(b)(ii). There remains, however, a question as to how far the references in the text of Article 26(3)(b)(ii) to \"the Investor\" and \"the dispute\" themselves require some form of identity between the claims in, say, domestic legal proceedings and in a potential arbitration. The issue is not (as indicated) one which the Tribunal has to decide. The Tribunal is in some doubt, however, as to whether the provisions of a multilateral Treaty of this kind should be construed with the same strict rigour that might be appropriate for the application of a national procedural rule, e.g. of *res judicata.* The justification for a more flexible interpretative approach, informed by the purpose the treaty rule is intended to serve, would be not simply the different nature of the legal instruments involved, but also the difference in the prospective effects: the application of a domestic rule of *res judicata* is there to prevent the re-litigation of an issue that has already been authoritatively determined; a treaty rule may serve the different purpose of preventing forumshopping.25 An approach as strict as the one the Claimant contends for here would make the operation of Article 26(3)(b) entirely dependent (so far as its relationship with domestic legal proceedings was concerned) on whether the national law in question permitted the litigation of a *treaty dispute as such* in the local courts or tribunals. But to make the issue turn in that way on the *form* in which the local legal action had been brought, rather than on the *real substance* of the underlying rights at issue would clearly run the risk of subverting what may have been the intention behind the treaty provision. The alternative would be to treat Article 26(3)(b) as a classic fork-in-the-road provision, of a kind commonly encountered in the field of investment arbitration, and that would in turn imply a much stricter approach to the identity of claims. Were the issue to arise for determination in a future case, it would require the tribunal in such a case to rank the relative weight of two treaty provisions of apparently coordinate status, sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 26(3): the one entailing an unconditional giving of consent, and the other an unmistakable non-consent, linked by the \"subject to\" formulation in sub-paragraph (a).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the tribunal in *Petrobart Ltd. v. Kyrgyz Republic,* Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce No. 126/2003, Award, 29 March 2005 *('Petrobart'),* appears to have regarded Article 26(3)(b) as a special treaty rule different from the general principle of *res judicata,* whereas the tribunal in *Yukos* appears to have made a different assumption.\n\n**XII. IS LIBANANCO ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF ARTICLE 17 OF THE ECT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nThe Tribunal passes now briefly to the fourth Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection (set out in paragraph 105.4 above), under which the Respondent claims that it has in any event the right to deny Libananco the benefits of the ECT, in application of its Article 17.\n\n550.\n\nArticle 17 of the ECT is a denial of benefits clause, under which each Contracting Party \"reserves the right\" to deny the advantages of Part III of the Treaty in, among other things, the following two cases:\n\n(a) if the Investor is a legal entity owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a third state and if the entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organised (Article 17(1)); \"Area\" in this context is a term of art, defined in Article 1(10), and includes the land and maritime territory of a Contracting Party; and\n\n(b) if the Investment is an Investment of an Investor of a third state with or as to which (among other things) the denying Contracting Party does not maintain a diplomatic relationship (Article 17(2)).26\n\nThe use of the phrase \"reserves the right\" raises difficulties that have troubled other tribunals,27 specifically what (if anything) the Contracting State must do in order to exercise its reserved right; when it may (or must) do so; and whether the effect is retrospective, or prospective only. The Tribunal has nothing of its own to add to the debate on that subject.\n\nA difference between the drafting of the two provisions is that the first of them is cast in objective terms, whereas the second is in terms expressly imposing on the denying Contracting Party the burden of establishing the factual predicate; see further below.\n\nCf. *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, and *Petrobart.*\n\n551.\n\nThere was no dispute in the present case as to whether Libananco was formed as a Cypriot company and as to who held the rights of ownership or control over Libananco28 at the time the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration was filed. There was also no dispute as to the state of the diplomatic relationship between Turkey and Cyprus. Nor was there any serious difference between the Parties as to the nature of Libananco\u2019s business activities in Cyprus. The issue that has occupied the major part of the argument between the Parties is what meaning should be attributed to \"third state,\" and whether the term has the same meaning in both Article 17 and Article 7 of the ECT. The Tribunal had the benefit in this regard of the testimony of Mr Craig Bamberger, who, as chief legal counsel to the International Energy Agency, was closely associated with all aspects of the drafting of the ECT during its negotiation, and who kept a detailed personal record on which his Witness Statement had been based. Mr Bamberger was not called for cross-examination, nor was his written testimony challenged. The Tribunal therefore treats it as an accurate account of what took place during the negotiations, which may be drawn on, as necessary, in interpreting and applying the relevant provisions of the ECT.\n\nAlthough there has been some debate between the Parties (not material for present purposes) as to whether Cem Uzan, Hakan Uzan, or Mr Turkkan had or had not become Jordanian nationals.\n\n552.\n\nApart from a comprehensive account of the several national proposals that were in due course amalgamated into what became the denial of benefits provisions in Article 17, the following were the principal points to emerge from Mr Bamberger\u2019s evidence.\n\n(a) The term \"third state\" appears in numerous Articles of the ECT, viz. Articles l(7)(b), 7(10)(a)(i), 9(1), 10(3), 10(7), 12(1), and in Article 17 itself.\n\n(b) As the negotiations entered their final phase, the uniform usage in all of these provisions (other than Article 7) was the phrase \"state that is not a Contracting Party\".\n\n(c) This phrase was then replaced, at the very final stages, by the term \"third state,\" but this was a purely technical drafting operation undertaken by the Secretariat on the recommendation of the Legal Sub-Group, and was not intended to bring about any change of meaning.\n\n(d) Article 7 of the ECT was negotiated separately from Article 17, and under the aegis of a different Conference committee. No specific process was set in train, in the rushed final days of the Conference, to ensure an overall concordance of texts, or in particular to compare or reconcile the usage in Article 7 with that in other provisions, or *vice* *versa.*29\n\nSuggestive of the rushed circumstances is the fact that in one place in the definitions Article itself, Article 1 (7)(b), the term \"third state\" appears in quotation marks, implying that there may have been some thought of including a definition of that term as well.\n\n553.\n\nAgainst that background, the Tribunal does not believe that the interpretation of the disputed term raises anywhere near the difficulties that emerged in the conflicting argumentation of the Parties. The Tribunal recalls that, in the application of the principles of interpretation laid down in the VCLT, the starting point for interpretation is the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty (in their context and in the light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose), but that a special meaning shall be given to a term *\"if it is established that the parties so intended\"*,30 No evidence has been led to suggest any such intention in respect of the use of the term \"third state\" in Article 17, or indeed in the other Articles listed above - with the possible exception of Article 7. The interpretative process begins, accordingly, with the ordinary meaning of the term. The Tribunal is satisfied that \u2018third state\u2019 has a well recognised ordinary meaning in treaty law. As appears from Section 4 of the VCLT (entitled *\"TREATIES AND THIRD STATES\"),* the expression means simply *\"state not party to the treaty in question\",* which is indeed the only way in which one can give meaning to the *\"General rule regarding third States\"* enunciated in Article 34 of the VCLT, or to the particular rules laid down in Articles 35-37, or to the saving clause contained in Article 38.31 This reading corresponds exactly to what (according to the evidence of Mr Bamberger) transpired in the closing stages of the Conference on the ECT, when the crystal-clear phrase *\"state that is not a Contracting Party\"* was replaced by \"third state\". Had the change not been made, there would have been no room for argument on the question. But the Tribunal is not persuaded that the blanket drafting change in all of the Articles in which the longer version occurred was intended to - or had the effect of -changing the sense of these provisions as a matter of \"ordinary meaning\". If any confirmation of this were needed, it can be found by looking at the uses of this term in the ECT \"in their context\", as the VCLT requires. Without performing this analysis in detail, the Tribunal can content itself with observing that, in all of the cases listed above (with the exception of Articles 7 and 17), the reference to a \"third state\" is juxtaposed immediately alongside a reference to \"a Contracting Party\" or \"the Contracting Parties\", in such a way as to leave no room for doubt that the two situations were meant to indicate mutually exclusive alternatives. The Tribunal regards that as powerful confirmation that the term \"third state\" is used in the ECT in its normal sense. The wording of Article 17 on its own may offer, by contrast, no strong contextual evidence of the same kind, but in its place we have Mr Bamberger\u2019s account that the Article had been worded \"state that is not a Contracting Party\" until the final stages, when the wording was altered together with the same phrase in other articles.\n\nVCLT Article 31(4).\n\nThe term itself, \"third state\", no doubt had its origin against the background of the classic bilateral treaty, in which there were two (only) Contracting States, so that any non-Contracting State was by that fact alone a \"third\" State. But it seems plain that the International Law Commission had not the slightest difficulty in generalising the usage, by analogy, to treaties of all kinds.\n\n554.\n\nDoes it make any difference to this clear picture that Article 7 explicitly provides that a \"third state\" can be a Contracting Party? In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it does not. This view does not depend in its entirety on Mr Bamberger\u2019s evidence referred to in paragraph 552(d) above, although the Tribunal observes that Mr Bamberger\u2019s evidence would be directly relevant if there were to exist any ambiguity that might be resolved by reference to the preparatory work.32 But in truth there is no ambiguity in Article 7 itself, the terms of which admit only one possibility, namely that in this Article a \"third state\" can be a Contracting State, because that is what the definition in paragraph (10)(a)(i) says expressly. Once again, moreover, it is the context that explains the usage, since in this particular case, where the subject of the treaty provision is *transit,* there is by definition a first state (the state of origin) and a second state (the state whose territory is being transited), so that the state of destination becomes, in an ordinary linguistic sense, a \"third\" state - but in circumstances in which it would make no sense to apply the treaty to the carriage *unless* the \"third\" state were itself a Contracting Party. However the clinching argument is in any case, as the Tribunal sees matters, the explicit indication in the *chapeau* to Article 7(10) that the two definitions which follow are *\"[flor the purposes of* *this Article* *\"33,* which automatically excludes the export of either of those two definitions to other Articles, Article 17 included.\n\nArticle 32(a) of the VCLT.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n555.\n\nThe only substantial argument remaining is the one from *effet utile,* on which the Respondent, placed greater and greater reliance as the arbitration proceeded. The essence of the argument is that the purpose and effect of Article 17(2) is to deny benefits (\"advantages\", in the treaty text), so that the provision would make no sense unless those benefits were in principle available, from which it must follow (so the argument continues) that \"third state\" must be capable of including Treaty Parties, since otherwise *\"an Investment of an Investor of a third state\"* would not enjoy Part III benefits in the first place.\n\n556.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find this argument convincing. One might begin by pointing out that, under the Respondent\u2019s construction, the picture contains no \"third\" state at all (in the numerical sense). More substantively, though, both \"Investor\" and \"Investment\" are capitalized in the wording of Article 17(2), so indicating that they are used as terms of art defined as in Article 1. And the definition of \"Investor\" in Article 1(7) is deliberately drawn so as to allow for third state Investors. The clear probability must therefore be that Article 17(2) had in mind a quite different eventuality from the one posited by the Respondent, namely one in which the \"Investment\" itself is made - in a direct sense - from within the circle of the Contracting Parties, but the ultimate beneficial owner or controller of the \"Investment\" (the \"Investor\") belongs to a \"third state\" as envisaged in Article 1(7). That would then make sense of the difference in phraseology as between paragraphs (1) and (2)34, with its requirement under paragraph (2) that the denying Contracting Party has to \"*establish*\" the ultimate third state nature of the Investor/Investment in order to be entitled to deny him/it the advantages of Part III of the ECT. This seems to the Tribunal to be the natural reading of Article 17, and it finds in fact some confirmation in the account in Mr Bamberger\u2019s witness statement.\n\nFn. 26 above.\n\n**XIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n557.\n\nBoth Parties have asked that their legal and arbitration costs be borne in full by the other party.\n\n558.\n\nThe Claimant has quantified its total costs at US$ 24,381,556. This sum consists of US$ 18,099,523 by way of legal fees and US$ 6,282,033 in respect of other expenses. Its advances to ICSID amount to US$ 627,754. In its Petition for Costs of 1 July 2010, the Claimant contended, among other things, that the Respondent attempted to frustrate the proceedings and acted in bad faith, and that this conduct warrants an award of costs in favour of the Claimant. According to the Claimant, the alleged misconduct includes the Respondent\u2019s attempts to intimidate the Claimant\u2019s counsel, witnesses and experts (e.g. by electronic surveillance), delaying tactics, knowingly false allegations of fraud, default of Tribunal Orders and the withholding of evidence.\n\n559.\n\nThe Respondent has quantified its total costs at US$ 35,702,417.76. This sum likewise consists of US$ 25,699,521 by way of legal fees and US$ 10,002,896.76 in respect of other expenses. Its advances to ICSID amount to US$ 625,000. The Respondent contended that it has reasonably incurred these costs in response to the nature of the claim and the manner in which the Claimant conducted itself over the lengthy period of the proceedings, in particular that it commenced and prosecuted an abusive claim. According to the Respondent, the Claimant repeatedly altered its case theory and narrative, which forced the Respondent to gather evidence from multiple jurisdictions and engage counsel and experts to investigate, evaluate and refute the Claimant\u2019s contentions. The Respondent referred, in addition, to the considerable burden of having to translate documents and submissions out of and into Turkish. The Respondent requested for interest on the amount awarded, to accrue at a reasonable commercial rate as from the date of the Award.\n\n560.\n\nUnder Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*\"the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid\".*\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention gives it the power to award costs (defined to include legal fees, out of pocket expenses as well as costs of the arbitration) and the discretion to decide at what level to do so. This view has also been expressed by other ICSID tribunals.\n\n561.\n\nThe costs claims mentioned above were submitted by the Parties in response to an order from the Tribunal dated 2 April 2010. No page limit was prescribed, and each Party\u2019s submission on costs was full and detailed in the sense that breakdowns of the total fees and expenses claimed were given, although not of the actual work done represented by the various invoices rendered, nor (in all cases) of the actual expenses incurred.\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that the amounts claimed by each Party as its own costs and expenses are very substantial indeed. This applies to both the claims for legal fees and to those for other expenses. The Tribunal acknowledges of course that a multiplicity of issues of both fact and law has been raised before it, that a significant amount of technical forensic evidence has been deployed by each Party, and that experts in various disciplines have been commissioned on both sides to present written reports to the Tribunal and to testify orally in these proceedings. The Tribunal is nevertheless constrained to observe that what it is presently adjudging in this Award, close to five years after these arbitral proceedings commenced, remains, all the same, no more than a selection of four among the set of Preliminary Objections raised by the Respondent. An explanation of why each Party has incurred its costs and expenses is not the same thing as a justification of their necessity. Many national jurisdictions that follow a practice of awarding costs to the successful party also make a distinction between the costs actually incurred by a litigating party and those which are assessed by the court as having been reasonably and necessarily incurred for the purposes of the litigation, and base their award of costs on the latter not the former. Without being in any way bound by national practice of this kind, the Tribunal regards the underlying approach as suitable for international arbitration, and intends to follow it in the present case. In this regard, the Tribunal has considered, among other things, the following factors (in no particular order of importance):\n\n(a) the importance of the matter to the Parties and the value of money or property involved, namely the sum of some US$ 10.1 billion claimed by the Claimant (which the Tribunal understands to be the largest claim in ICSID arbitration at the time the Request for Arbitration was filed);\n\n(b) the amount and extent of factual and expert evidence adduced in these proceedings in relation to the issue of whether Libananco acquired ownership of the share certificates in question by 12 June 2003;\n\n(c) the conduct of the Parties during the proceedings; and\n\n(d) the circumstances in which the work or parts of it were done (which the Tribunal understands to have taken place across multiple jurisdictions and involving extensive arrangements for travel, translation and investigation made by both Parties).\n\n563.\n\nAlthough many ICSID tribunals have ruled that each party should bear its own costs, others have applied the principle that \"costs follow the event\", or else have proceeded to an allocation *pro rata,* i.e. an allocation proportionate to the tribunal\u2019s assessment of the relative merits of all claims made by the parties. The present Tribunal is of the view that a rule under which costs follow the event serves the purposes of compensating the successful party for its necessary legal fees and expenses, of discouraging unmeritorious actions and also of providing a disincentive to over-litigation. It also allows a tribunal sufficient leeway to take due account of specific issues on which the overall losing party has nevertheless succeeded, and to take account as well of the costs implications of procedural motions raised by one or another party. The Tribunal accordingly considers that it is appropriate to apply here the principle that \"costs follow the event\" and that a costs order should be made in favour of the Respondent, on the basis that the Claimant has not been able to prove its ownership of the investment that forms the essential foundation for these lengthy and hard fought proceedings.\n\n564.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has also to take into account those issues where it is not appropriate for costs to be awarded in favour of the ultimate prevailing Party, because it was not the winner on that particular issue or \"event\" or indeed because there was no decision as to who won or lost. In the present case, the Tribunal believes that the following matters are ones where the Respondent should not be awarded its costs and expenses.\n\n(a) Costs and expenses arising from complaints to the Tribunal by the Claimant relating to the alleged covert surveillance of the Claimant\u2019s representatives, Counsel and witnesses, which led to the Tribunal\u2019s order of 1 May 2008 after an oral hearing. The reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decision in this regard may be gleaned from its order of 1 May 2008.\n\n(b) Costs and expenses arising from the Respondent\u2019s application for sequestration and forensic inspection of the \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez share certificates held by Libananco pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Preliminary Issues of 23 June 2008 (directing the share certificates in question to be held by an escrow agent and forensically inspected), as well as the costs and expenses relating to the actual inspection. At the end of the day, the evidence adduced arising from this inspection yielded little or no evidence that assisted the Tribunal in its decisions, except to the limited extent that the experts from both Parties were able to reach agreement.\n\n(c) Costs and expenses arising from a similar application for forensic inspection of the STAs and certain other documents in Washington, D.C. pursuant to an order from the Tribunal dated 3 November 2008 as well as costs and expenses relating to the actual inspection. Again, the ultimate result of the inspections yielded little or no evidence that assisted the Tribunal in its decisions, except to the limited extent that the experts from both Parties were able to reach agreement on certain propositions.\n\n(d) Costs and expenses in relation to the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections which are dealt with at paragraphs 537 to 556 above (i.e. the second, third and fourth Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections). For the reasons stated in the earlier parts of this Award, once the Tribunal had decided on the main factual issue, it became unnecessary to decide the remaining Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections but, in view of the substantial submissions made by the Parties, the Tribunal has set out its thoughts on them without making any decision on any of them. While it would not be right to penalise either Party for the costs of these undecided issues, the fact is that there was no winner on any of them, and the Tribunal therefore does not believe it appropriate to award any costs or expenses in regard to them in favour of either Party.\n\n565.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is inclined to exercise some restraint in assessing the reasonable amount of costs and expenses that should be awarded to the Respondent pursuant to paragraph 563 above. While the Respondent\u2019s wish to assemble a powerful battery of legal and other resources is well understood, given the magnitude of the claim against it, other underlying aspects of the tensions between the Parties (reflected in the way the case was argued on both sides), lend themselves less well to being reflected in a costs order by an ICSID tribunal. Specifically, although the Tribunal is conscious that the claim was for a sum in excess of US$ 10 billion, the Tribunal is mindful that:\n\n(a) the claim for costs and expenses is significantly larger than any claim for costs previously made in an ICSID arbitration, as well as significantly larger than any previous award for costs and expenses made by any previous ICSID tribunal;\n\n(b) the Award in this case is on a jurisdictional issue (albeit hotly contested as to facts and law) and a selection of other preliminary issues; and\n\n(c) there needs to be some proportionality in the award (as opposed to the expenditure) of legal costs and expenses. A party with a deep pocket may have its own justification for heavy spending, but it cannot expect to be reimbursed for all its expenditure as a matter of course simply because it is ultimately the prevailing party.\n\n566.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not in the position of a national court which can undertake a detailed assessment on an item by item basis of a party\u2019s claim for legal costs and expenses. Following contemporary international arbitration practice, the Tribunal takes a \"broad-brush\" approach to the task of determining a reasonable figure to award for such legal costs and expenses.\n\n567.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to order the Claimant to pay the Respondent the sum of US$ 15,000,000 in respect of legal fees and out of pocket expenses, representing what in the Tribunal\u2019s view amounts to an appropriate figure to award, having regard to the principles and reasons set out above, and to all the circumstances of this case.\n\n568.\n\nThe above excludes the question of the costs of the arbitration (i.e. the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and of the ICSID Secretariat), which amount to approximately US$ 1,205,000. As a result, each Party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to approximately US$ 602,500. The decision of the Tribunal is that such costs should follow the ultimate event, and must be paid in full by the Claimant.\n\n569.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent the sum of US$ 602,500 representing the estimated expended portion of the Respondent\u2019s advance on the costs of the arbitration,35 as well as a proportion of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and out of pocket expenses in the sum of US$ 15,000,000. The above amounts will bear interest on the outstanding amount thereafter at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus one per cent per annum, such interest to run from the 31st day after the date of despatch of this Award on the unpaid portion of the amounts due on this Award.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will in due course provide the Parties with a financial statement of the case account and the Parties will be reimbursed the remaining balance proportionally to the amount which was paid by each Party.\n\n**XIV. OPERATIVE SECTION**\n--------------------------\n\n570.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal decides as follows.\n\n570.1 The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the present case as Libananco has not proved that it owned shares in \u00c7EA\u015e and Kepez before 12 June 2003.\n\n570.2 All the Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration are dismissed.\n\n570.3 The Claimant is ordered to pay the Respondent US$ 602,500 in reimbursement of the expended portion of the Respondent\u2019s advance on costs as well as US$ 15,000,000 in respect of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and out of pocket expenses; such amounts to bear interest on the outstanding amount thereafter at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus one per cent per annum, such interest to run from the 31st day after the date of despatch of this Award on the unpaid portion of the amounts due on this Award.\n\n570.4 Recalling its Order of 1 May 2008 (pursuant to which the Claimant was ordered, amongst other things, to deliver the original share certificates to the custody of an escrow agent) and having regard to the following matters:\n\n(a) paragraph 3.2.7 of the Tribunal\u2019s Order of 1 May 2008 (pursuant to which the Tribunal retained the discretion to make further orders concerning the custody of the share certificates held in escrow);\n\n(b) the share certificates were ordered to be produced, pursuant to the specific terms of the Tribunal\u2019s order, for the sole purpose of examination by the Parties (by means of their respective forensic experts or otherwise);\n\n(c) such examination is now complete;\n\n(d) the Tribunal has dismissed the Claimant\u2019s claim on the grounds that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the present dispute;\n\n(e) there being no reason for Libananco\u2019s share certificates to be held in escrow any further;\n\nthe Tribunal now orders the release of the share certificates from escrow to the Claimant."}, {"Title": "Decision on Applicant's Request for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Applicant's Request for Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 12 December 2012, Libananco Holdings Co. Limited (\"Applicant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application for annulment (\"Application\") of the award of September 2, 2011 (\"Award\") rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal (\"the Tribunal\") in the arbitration between Applicant and the Republic of Turkey (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8) (\"Arbitration\").\n\n2.\n\nOn March 14, 2012, after the *ad hoc* Committee (\"Committee) had been constituted and the proceedings had begun, Applicant filed a Request for Provisional Measures (\"Request\").1 By letter of March 15, 2012, the Committee invited the Republic of Turkey (\"Respondent\") to file its observations on the Request by March 23, 2012. Respondent filed its observations as directed on March 23, 2012 (\"Observations\").\n\nThe full procedural history of the annulment proceeding to date is described in the Committee\u2019s Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for A continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award of May 7, 2012\n\n3.\n\nOn March 26, 2012, the Committee invited Applicant to file a reply on the Request by April 2, 2012 and Respondent to file a rejoinder by April 9, 2012. Following Respondent\u2019s request for an extension to file the rejoinder due to the Easter holidays, Applicant offered to file its reply earlier, by March 29, 2012. Accordingly, Applicant filed its reply on March 29, 2012 (\"Reply\") and Respondent filed its rejoinder on April 9, 2012 (\"Rejoinder\").\n\n4.\n\nDuring the first session of the Committee on April 11, 2012, the parties made two rounds of oral submissions on the Request, which were recorded and transcribed.\n\n**II. Position of the Parties on the Request**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Applicant\u2019s Request***\n----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nApplicant has requested that the Committee order provisional measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"). Applicant has also referred to Rule 53 which provides that, *mutatis mutandis,* the Arbitration Rules shall apply to any procedure relating to the annulment of an award.\n\n6.\n\nAccording to Applicant, provisional measures are urgently needed \"to preserve the [Applicant\u2019s] rights, including the right to due process of law, the right to a fair hearing, the right to confidentiality and legal privilege and, ultimately, the right to prepare and present its case without interference from the Respondent\u2019s illicit espionage.\" (Request, para. 5)\n\n7.\n\nApplicant argues that \"[n]o finding of fact is required on the part of the *ad hoc* Committee to issue the Orders set out in Section IV below. The requested provisional measures are derived directly from the findings of fact and determinations made by the Tribunal in the underlying arbitration. It was on the basis of those determinations that the Tribunal based its own Orders restraining the Respondent. The Claimant requests that the *ad hoc* Committee merely reproduce those Orders, modified only to reflect the fact that this is now the annulment phase\". (Request, para. 2)\n\n8.\n\nApplicant states that Respondent conducted illicit espionage of Applicant, its representatives, its counsel, witnesses and experts in the underlying arbitration (\"the espionage activities\"), and used it for the purposes of the Arbitration. Hence, the orders issued by the Tribunal on May 1, 2008 (\"the 2008 Orders\"). Applicant further states that Respondent continued its illicit espionage in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s orders and that there is no evidence that Respondent has ceased its illicit espionage of Applicant.\n\n9.\n\nApplicant contends that, in view of \"the compelling evidence and the nature of the rights which are at risk, it is a matter of urgency that the ad hoc Committee recommend the requested provisional measures.\" (Request, para. 19) Furthermore, Applicant asserts that the measures are necessary to prevent harm or prejudice to Applicant. According to Applicant, the standard to be applied is a standard of reasonableness and it argues that \"[i]t is reasonable to conclude that, in the absence of restraint on the Respondent, the [Applicant\u2019s] right to a fair trial, guaranteed in the Convention and under international law, will be irreparably damaged.\" (Request, para. 20)\n\n***2. Respondent\u2019s Observations***\n----------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nRespondent argues that, contrary to the understanding of Applicant, there is no basis in the ICSID Convention for the Committee to order provisional measures in an annulment proceeding. According to Respondent, the relevant article is Article 52(4) of the Convention, which does not include Article 47 in the list of provisions applicable *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee. Respondent contends that \"the power of an annulment committee to order stay of enforcement is *lex specialis* to the annulment regime and the only provisional measure available to it.\" (Observations, para. 83) Respondent takes the position that an ICSID *ad hoc* annulment committee has no power to \"reproduce\" automatically the provisional measures recommended by the arbitral tribunal in the underlying arbitration. (Observations, para. 85)\n\n11.\n\nIn any case, Respondent further argues, Applicant has not produced any evidence in support of its Request and the provisional measures ordered by the original Tribunal lapsed with the issuance of the Award. Respondent thus pleads that the Request be dismissed with costs.\n\n***3. Applicant\u2019s Reply***\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIn Applicant\u2019s Reply, it questions the analysis of the ICSID Convention by Respondent and argues that Article 52(4) does provide for the application of Article 44 of the Convention *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings. According to Applicant, Article 44 \"allows the Committee to refer to the Arbitration Rules to determine any question of procedure, including the question of whether it has the power to recommend provisional measures.\" (Reply, para. 32) Applicant contends that \"it would be a procedural and substantive absurdity if an ICSID tribunal were able to order certain behavior pending the outcome of the case but an ICSID ad hoc Committee were not able to do so whilst the outcome of the case was still pending.\" *(ibid.')*\n\n13.\n\nApplicant insists on the necessity and urgency of the measures requested based on the evidence submitted in the underlying arbitration and the additional evidence of \"the Respondent\u2019s illicit espionage of the underlying arbitration in the Request for Provisional Measures.\" (Reply, para. 34) Applicant requests that the Committee draw all of the appropriate negative inferences from Respondent\u2019s failure to provide any assurance and concludes with pleading that the Committee recommends the requested measures in order to safeguard its fundamental procedural rights.\n\n***4. Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder***\n-------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nRespondent in the Rejoinder reiterates its argument that annulment committees have no power to order interim measures because Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention \"expressly excludes Article 47.\" (Rejoinder, para. 29) According to Respondent, \"[i]f any of the ICSID Rules, or Articles in Section IV of the Convention, could be reimported into annulment proceedings via Article 44, even though they have been expressly excluded by Article 52(4), the exclusion would be deprived of any *effet utile.* This cannot be right. The specific exclusion in Article 52(4) must prevail over the general provision in Article 44.\" (Rejoinder, para. 32)\n\n**III. Analysis of the Committee**\n----------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Request gives rise to the question of whether the Committee has competence to recommend provisional measures. The fact that Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention does not refer to Article 47 of the Convention provides considerable support for the view that the Committee has no such competence. Moreover, it is at least doubtful whether the general reference in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention to the Arbitration Rules, as read together with Rules 39 and 53 of the Arbitration Rules, is sufficient to provide the Committee with such competence despite the absence in Article 52(4) of a reference to the specific Article dealing with provisional measures.\n\n16.\n\nHowever, the Committee notes that a determination of this question of interpretation of the ICSID Convention will only be necessary if the circumstances are such that, assuming the Committee\u2019s competence, they would justify granting the request for provisional measures. The Committee considers in this regard that a decision recommending provisional measures could not be issued unless Applicant has established the need for such measures in order to preserve its rights in the proceedings before the Committee.\n\n17.\n\nHowever, Applicant, while relying on occurrences and findings during the proceedings before the Tribunal, has adduced no elements relating to the present situation but has affirmed that no new findings of fact are needed for the Committee to re-issue, *mutatis mutandis,* the 2008 Orders. The Committee cannot find it established that the present situation is the same as that which caused the Tribunal to issue a decision on provisional measures. Without evidence that Respondent is at present engaging in activities harmful to Applicant\u2019s procedural rights or interests, or that Respondent is likely to engage in such activities in the course of the further proceedings, the Committee cannot find a sufficient basis for issuing orders identical to those which were issued several years ago by the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nIt follows that it is not necessary to determine the Committee\u2019s competence to recommend provisional measures, since in any case Applicant\u2019s request for an order on such measures must be dismissed.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\n19.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee unanimously decides:\n\n(a) To dismiss the Request.\n\n(b) To reserve its decision on costs related to the Request for a later stage of the proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 12, 2012, Libananco Holdings Co. Limited (\"Applicant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application requesting the annulment of the award rendered on September 2, 2011 (\"Award\"). The application (\"Application\") was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nUnder Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), the Application contained a request for a stay of enforcement of the Award (\"Stay Request\"), concerning the amount of USD 15, 602,500.00 and interest in favor of Respondent.\n\n3.\n\nOn December 20, 2011, the Secretary-General informed the parties that the Application had been registered on that date. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules, enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of February 14, 2012, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the parties that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"Committee\") had been constituted - composed of Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (Spanish) as President, and Judge Hans Danelius (Swedish) and Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero (Colombian and French) as Members - and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The parties were also informed that Ms. Martina Polasek would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the Committee invited Applicant to file the reasons for the Stay Request by March 2, 2012 and Respondent to file its observations thereon within fourteen days from Applicant\u2019s submission of reasons.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 2, 2012, Applicant filed its statement of reasons in support of the Stay Request (\"Request\").\n\n7.\n\nOn March 12, 2012, upon Respondent\u2019s request for an extension of time and after having received Applicant\u2019s observations on the extension, the Committee extended to March 23, 2012 the time-limit for Respondent to file its observations on the Stay Request.\n\n8.\n\nOn March 23, 2012, Respondent filed observations on the Stay Request (\"Observations\").\n\n9.\n\nOn March 26, 2012, the Committee invited Applicant to file a reply on the Stay Request by April 2, 2012 and Respondent to file a rejoinder by April 9, 2012. Following Respondent\u2019s request for an extension to file the rejoinder due to the Easter holidays, Applicant offered to file its reply earlier, by March 29, 2012. Accordingly, Applicant filed its reply on March 29, 2012 (\"Reply\") and Respondent filed its rejoinder on April 9, 2012 (\"Rejoinder\").\n\n10.\n\nBy agreement of the parties the Committee held its first session in Paris, France, on April 11, 2012. The parties made two rounds of oral submissions on the Stay Request (and on a request for provisional measures), which were recorded and transcribed. Present at the session were:\n\nAttending on behalf of Applicant  \nMr. Robert G. Volterra Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Stephen Fietta Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Ashique Rahman Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Bernhard Maier Volterra Fietta\n\nAttending on behalf of Respondent  \nMr Ali Agacdan Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Republic of Turkey  \nMr Serkan Yikarbaba Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Republic of Turkey  \nMr Mustafa Cetin Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Republic of Turkey  \nMs Pelin Gudulluoglu Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Republic of Turkey  \nMr Veij o Heiskanen Lalive  \nMr Matthias Scherer Lalive  \nMs Laura Halonen Lalive  \nDr Martin Dawidowicz Lalive  \nMs Galiye Sara\u00e7 Interpreter\n\n**II. The Position of the Parties on the Stay Request**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Applicant\u2019s Request***\n----------------------------\n\n11.\n\nApplicant requests the continuation of the stay of enforcement of paragraph 570.3 of the Award until a decision is rendered by the Committee on the Application. In paragraph 570.3 the Arbitral Tribunal ordered Libananco Holdings Co. Limited to pay Respondent:\n\n\"USS 602,500 in reimbursement of the expended portion of the Respondent\u2019s advance on costs as well as USS 15,000,000 in respect of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and out of pocket expenses; such amounts to bear interest on the outstanding amount thereafter at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus one per cent per annum, such interest to run from the 31st day after the date of dispatch of this Award on the unpaid portion of the amounts due on this Award.\"\n\n12.\n\nApplicant contends that actions taken on behalf of Respondent, including surveillance of Applicant\u2019s legal counsel and large-scale interception of privileged communications tainted the entire arbitration proceeding, and reasons as follows:\n\n\"By granting the continuation of the stay, the **ad hoc** Committee would reserve the underlying question of whether annulment should be granted until such time as it has had an opportunity to evaluate the respective arguments from both Parties in full. If, on the other hand, it declined at this stage to continue the stay without having had a chance to hear the parties\u2019 arguments and to re-examine the underlying evidence, the *ad hoc* Committee would be prematurely rendering a decision that it may, upon having examined the claims put before it, then seek to reverse in the future. Given this, the **ad hoc** Committee should continue the stay.\" (Request, para. 9)\n\n13.\n\nApplicant argues further that if Respondent would be allowed to enforce the awarded legal fees incurred in defending the original arbitration by illicit means, this would effectively amount to approval of Respondent\u2019s conduct in the original arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nAccording to Applicant, if the Committee were to reject the Application, Respondent would be adequately compensated with the amount of interest that will continue to accrue during the annulment proceedings. On the other hand, if the Application was sustained it would be extremely difficult for Applicant to recover the payment made pursuant to paragraph 570.3 of the Award. Applicant points to the usual difficulties in seeking enforcement against sovereign States and to the political campaign against secular politicians in Turkey of which allegedly the expropriation of Applicant\u2019s assets subject of the arbitral proceedings was part.\n\n15.\n\nApplicant argues that its request is neither dilatory nor vexatious and refers to cases in which ad hoc committees have found such criteria to be decisive in determining whether or not to grant a stay request. Applicant concludes by referring to the expropriation of its assets, its dire consequences for Applicant on its ability to pay the costs of the award and the \"possibly irreparable burden\" that enforcement would place on Applicant. (Request, para. 20)\n\n***2. Respondent\u2019s Observations***\n----------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nRespondent opposes the continuation of the Stay Request. Respondent argues that the stay should be lifted, that it is dilatory, that the precedents cited by Applicant refer to cases where a sovereign State is an award debtor and are far from uniform, and that it is part of the Uzan family\u2019s litigation harassment campaign against Turkey.\n\n17.\n\nAccording to Respondent, stay requests are not automatic and there is no precedent of a stay granted at the request of an investor whose claim has been rejected for lack of jurisdiction. Respondent contends that \"[i]n such circumstances, a stay of enforcement is inappropriate.\"1 (Observations, para. 11)\n\nThe phrase is taken from Professor C. Schreuer\u2019s comments on *Soufraki* in *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary,* 2nd edition (2009) p. 1066.\n\n18.\n\nRespondent argues that: (a) there is no risk of frustration of recoupment; (b) this factor has been taken into consideration in cases where the private party is a creditor; and (c) Respondent has paid damages in an ICSID case and has a history of compliance with its international obligations.\n\n19.\n\nOn the other hand, it is Respondent\u2019s view that interest will not adequately compensate it for the delay in enforcement. Respondent maintains that enforcement and delay in payment are two separate issues and quotes in support the reasoning of the Committee in *Kardassopoulos and Fuchs* to the effect that post-award \"interests compensate for the forbearance of the principal until payment of the award\" and that \"[although they have a bearing on the efficacy of the award, post-award interests are not directly related to the issue of award enforcement.\" (Observations, para. 31)\n\n20.\n\nRespondent points out that Applicant has not provided any evidence that without the stay of enforcement Applicant would be placed under \"a significant and possibly irreparable burden.\" According to Respondent, Applicant itself is merely a mailbox company but its backers are extremely wealthy.\n\n21.\n\nShould the Committee decide to continue the stay, Respondent argues that it be conditional on the provision of financial security by Applicant. In support, Respondent explains that:\n\n\"The Uzans are fugitives from justice that have accumulated enormous wealth by illegal means, in particular by committing massive frauds in the telecoms (the ***Telsim fraud)*** and banking sector (the ***Imar Bank fraud).*** The Applicant is an alter ego in this enterprise. A recurrent feature, recognised by multiple courts in numerous jurisdictions, has been that the Uzans, and in particular the Applicant\u2019s beneficial owner Cem Uzan, will do whatever it takes to hide their assets from enforcement of court judgments against them. This includes fraudulent conveyance to prevent Turkey from enforcing the costs awards issued in the ICSID (Additional Facility) arbitrations brought by CNH and ECIT, two Polish companies. The Applicant and its backers have the means to comply with the Award, but they will certainly not do so.\" (Observations, para. 36. Emphasis in the original)\n\n22.\n\nRespondent refers to considerations of past *ad hoc* annulment committees which have balanced the rights of the parties and often focused on the likely compliance with the award in deciding whether a stay order should be accompanied by a financial guarantee. According to Respondent, risk of non-compliance is the most important consideration in ordering security and, in the present case, non-compliance is a virtual certainty given the pattern of non-compliance of the Uzan family.\n\n23.\n\nRespondent also points out that the ICSID Convention is not binding on Applicant and Respondent cannot rely on the primary security provided by the obligations assumed by States under Article 54. Hence, this consideration, which has been used in other cases as a reason for rejecting a request for security, is not applicable in the present circumstances.\n\n***3. Applicant\u2019s Reply***\n--------------------------\n\n24.\n\nApplicant points out that: (a) in every case cited by Respondent to show that granting the stay is not automatic, the Tribunal in fact granted the continuation of the requested stay of enforcement; (b) the cases *Soufraki* and *RSM* cited by Respondent do not support the position of Respondent because claimants in these cases did not file a stay application; and (c) Professor Schreuer\u2019s statement is cited out of context. According to Applicant, viewed in its proper context such statement refers to circumstances in which no stay of enforcement had been requested.\n\n25.\n\nApplicant argues that the Request and the Application are inextricably linked and should not be prejudged. It is Applicant\u2019s view that, \"[w]ere the *ad hoc* Committee not to grant the stay request - which would merely require a party to litigation to behave in a manner that should in no way cause the slightest controversy - would prematurely condone the Respondent\u2019s acts of surveillance, hacking and wiretapping that form the basis of the Application for Annulment.\" (Reply, para. 22)\n\n26.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s contention that the Request is \"dilatory and vexatious\", Applicant refers to the legitimate grounds of the Request under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention and to \"evidence of continued, uninterrupted procedural and substantive misconduct of a serious nature by the Respondent during the underlying arbitration, including repeated and deliberate noncompliance with the original Tribunal\u2019s orders.\" (Reply, para. 23) Applicant argues that \"[i]n light of the amassed evidence and mindful of the Respondent\u2019s admission by failure to rebut, it is apparent that the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Application for Annulment is \u2018dilatory and vexatious\u2019 is itself baseless and disproven by the evidence on record.\" (ibid.)\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Applicant, ICSID jurisprudence has recognized consistently that payment of interest is sufficient to compensate for the delay in the enforcement of an award. Applicant finds the distinction made by Respondent between a delay in payment and a delay in the enforcement of the award artificial and intended to obfuscate the issue. Applicant points out that the Award provides that interest accrues until payment and concludes that \"Respondent will be adequately compensated for any delay in both enforcement and payment of the Award.\" (Reply, para. 29)\n\n28.\n\nTo reject Respondent\u2019s demand that, if a stay is granted, the Committee should require that Applicant post security, Applicant relies on the argument that by granting the application for security the Committee would implicitly indicate that it has made up its mind before hearing the arguments and analyzing the evidence. Applicant adds that: (a) the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules do not require an applicant for stay of enforcement to provide security as a condition for the stay; (b) ICSID jurisprudence supports the continuation of a stay free from conditions; (c) Article 53 of the ICSID Convention provides \"primary security\" that \"the Parties will abide and comply with the terms of the Award\" (para. 41); and (d) conditioning the stay on the provision of security would further undermine the equality of arms in these proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nApplicant further states that Respondent\u2019s allegations in Section 3.3 of its Observations regarding the Uzan family \"highlight nothing more than the incumbent government\u2019s well-publicised and internationally-recognised, on-going campaign of persecution against political opposition in Turkey.\" Applicant therefore requests that the Committee strike this Section of Respondent\u2019s Observations from the record in its entirety.\n\n***4. Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder***\n-------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nRespondent observes that Applicant has changed the basis of its argument for a stay of enforcement from allegations of a \"political pogrom\" to references to illicit espionage. Respondent further observes that lack of denial by Respondent does not prove Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant needs to prove its case and Respondent, in any case, denies all allegations made by Applicant.\n\n31.\n\nRespondent contends that the Uzans are highly relevant for these proceedings. According to Respondent, Applicant is a shell company and \"alter ego\" of the Uzans, who have a propensity to engage in fraud. Respondent insists that these proceedings are part of the Uzans\u2019 litigation harassment campaign against Respondent and all previous cases have been dismissed as totally unfounded or even fraudulent. For this reason, Respondent qualifies the present proceedings as dilatory and vexatious.\n\n32.\n\nAccording to Respondent, *ad hoc* annulment committees have found that \"a stay should be accompanied by financial security to counterbalance the parties\u2019 rights, or alternatively held that the most important consideration in deciding upon the necessity for security is the prospect of compliance with the award.\" (Rejoinder, para. 13)\n\n33.\n\nRespondent takes issue with Applicant\u2019s request to strike Section 3.3 of the Respondent\u2019s Observations from the record. Respondent points out that evidence rather than argument may be deleted by ordinary tribunals; in the case of arbitral tribunals, it is their role to evaluate the weight of the evidence rather than to strike it out.\n\n34.\n\nRespondent asserts that there cannot be a presumption in favor of stay because annulment is an extraordinary remedy and argues that interest is not sufficient compensation for the delay in enforcement. Respondent observes that Applicant has not addressed the argument made in Respondent\u2019s Observations that payment and enforcement are two separate matters and then adds as additional arguments that: (a) the interest under the Award is not compounded; (b) enforcement provides closure; and (c) \"[...] it has been recognised in case law that the fact that there will be further delay in an ICSID award becoming enforceable during the annulment proceedings, regardless of interest, is a further factor to be taken into account in considering ordering security to be posted as a condition for a stay.\" (Rejoinder, para. 18)\n\n35.\n\nRespondent points out that Applicant has failed to address, *inter alia,* (a) the issue that different considerations apply in the case of debtors who are sovereigns and those applicable to private parties; and (b) that there is no risk of recoupment in light of Respondent\u2019s unblemished record of compliance with ICSID awards.\n\n36.\n\nRespondent disputes Applicant\u2019s argument that Respondent bears a heavy burden for establishing why a continuation of the stay should be conditioned on the provision of security. Respondent refers to the split in case law: some annulment committees have considered that the ordering of security was a question of balancing parties\u2019 rights, while others ordered security if there were sufficient doubts that the award would be paid; none of the cases places a heavy burden for security to be ordered.\n\n37.\n\nRespondent points out that there is no reciprocal international law obligation on Applicant under Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention and that, in the case of Article 53, Applicant is \"merely under a legal duty and obligation to implement the award based on its agreement to arbitrate.\" (Rejoinder, para. 25)\n\n38.\n\nAs a final point, Respondent notes that Applicant has not replied to Respondent\u2019s argument that the Applicant has no intention to respect the Award.\n\n**III. Analysis of the Committee**\n----------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIt will be useful for easy reference to reproduce here the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides: \"(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"\n\n40.\n\nRule 54 of the Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n\"(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\"\n\n41.\n\nUnder these provisions, the Committee has discretion to grant the Stay Request after giving the parties the opportunity to be heard and after consideration of all the circumstances relevant to the Stay Request. *Ad hoc* annulment committees concur in considering that the review by a committee of a stay request at an early stage of an annulment proceeding is of a very preliminary character and should in no way be based on an assessment or prejudgment of what will be the final outcome of the annulment proceeding.2 The factors taken into account by *ad hoc* annulment committees when deciding on stay of enforcement vary considerably, which may be explained by lack of guidance in the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and the particular circumstances of each request.3\n\nSee for instance, *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7) Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, November 30, 2004, para. 26 (\" *Mitchell* Decision\").\n\n*CDC Group v. Republic of the Seychelles* (ICSID Case ARB/02/14) Decision on Whether or Not to Continue Stay and Order, para. 9.\n\n42.\n\nThe parties\u2019 arguments in the present case raise the following questions to be addressed by the Committee: (a) whether the granting of the continuation of the stay of enforcement, despite the Committee\u2019s discretion referred to in para. 41, should be considered to be almost automatic, and, if not, (b) whether stay of enforcement is appropriate in the circumstances of the present case and, in this respect, (c) whether the Stay Request is dilatory or vexatious, (d) what burden will be imposed on the respective parties should the Stay Request be granted or rejected, and (e) if the Stay Request is granted, whether it should be conditioned by some type of security.\n\n43.\n\nThe exercise of the discretion of the Committee depends on the circumstances surrounding the Stay Request and, therefore, the granting of a stay of enforcement or its continuation should in no way be regarded as automatic. The Committee is aware that some *ad hoc* annulment committees have considered that, \"absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become almost automatic.\"4 However, this does not follow from the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules, and the Committee considers that its decision should be based on an assessment of all relevant circumstances.\n\n*V\u00edctor Pey Casado and Foundation \"President Allende\" v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case ARB/98/2) Decision on the Republic of Chile\u2019s Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award, para. 25\n\n44.\n\nRespondent has based its argument on whether the Stay Request is appropriate on a comment by Professor Schreuer in his *Commentary* on the ICSID Convention. According to Applicant, the comment has been taken out context. The comment in question appears at the end of a long paragraph which in relevant part reads as follows:\n\n\"[...] In *Vivendi I**,* the Tribunal had declined to rule on the merits of the claims arising out of the conduct of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, so there was no part of the Award\u2019s *dispositif* that warranted a stay. In *Soufraki v. UAE**,* the Tribunal had ruled that it lacked jurisdiction so again, there was no call for a stay of enforcement. Likewise, in *Luchetti v. Peru**,* it was the Claimant that sought annulment of an Award that had concluded that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction. In such circumstances, a stay of enforcement is inappropriate.\"5\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary,* 2nd edition (2009) p. 1066. Footnotes omitted.\n\n45.\n\nThe Committee first notes that the above text is part of a section which deals with \"Provisional Stay of Enforcement\" and not with the consideration of stay of enforcement requests by *ad hoc* annulment committees. Second, there was no request for provisional stay of enforcement in the cases mentioned in the quoted text or in the *RSM v. Grenada* case also cited by Respondent, a fact that Respondent itself has recognized.6 Third, in the instant case, the Stay Request has been provisionally granted by the Secretary-General. The Committee further notes that there is no distinction in the ICSID Convention between awards on jurisdiction or awards on the merits for purposes of enforcement.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, \"No stay application accompanied the request for annulment filed by the respective unsuccessful claimants in these cases *[Soufraki* and RSAY], para. 11.\n\n46.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the key question is whether part of the *dispositif* of the award warrants a stay of execution, as observed by Professor Schreuer in respect of *Vivendi I**.* The *dispositif* of most awards on jurisdiction will not warrant a stay of execution. In the instant case, however, and as already noted, Applicant has been ordered: \"to pay the Respondent US$ 602,500 in reimbursement of the expended portion of the Respondent\u2019s advance on costs as well as US$ 15,000,000 in respect of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and out of pocket expenses; such amounts to bear interest on the outstanding amount thereafter at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus one per cent per annum, such interest to run from the 31st day after the date of dispatch of this Award on the unpaid portion of the amounts due on this Award.\" (Award, para. 570.3)\n\n47.\n\nThe Committee has no doubt that, given the terms of the *dispostif* of the Award, Applicant has a clear interest in obtaining a continued stay of enforcement of the order on reimbursement and cost compensation, this being an interest which should be balanced against Respondent\u2019s interest in enforcing this part of the Award at an early point in time.\n\n48.\n\nRespondent has argued against the continuation of the stay because of its dilatory and vexatious character. According to the *Mitchell* *ad hoc* annulment committee, the dilatory character of a request refers to \"[...] the apparent seriousness of the invoked grounds; a *prima facie* dilatory application would be the one with a manifestly abusive character and would be for that reason only exclude the stay of enforcement\".7 For the *MTD ad hoc* annulment committee a dilatory stay request is an application \"brought without any basis under the Convention.\"8 A vexatious request is one which is abusive as being made for an improper purpose.\n\n*Mitchell* Decision, para. 26.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. &MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case ARB/01/7) Ad hoc Committee\u2019s Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Execution (\" *MTD* Decision\"), June 1, 2005, para. 28.\n\n49.\n\nThe Committee notes that Applicant has requested annulment of the Award in its entirety pursuant to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention and in particular has referred to, without limitation, the grounds enumerated in Article 52(1)(b) and (d). The Committee is not in a position at this stage of the proceeding to question the seriousness of the alleged grounds for annulment and there are no circumstances that would justify the assessment as a preliminary matter of whether or not the application is likely to succeed.9 Consequently, the Committee finds no basis for declaring the Stay Request to be dilatory or vexatious.\n\nIbid.\n\n50.\n\nThe parties have exchanged arguments on the respective burden that denial of the request or its continuation would entail. Applicant argues that denial of the Stay Request would be \"a possibly irreparable burden.\" Applicant recalls in this respect statements made by Turkish high officers as reported in the press to the effect that not one cent would be paid to Applicant. Against this argument Respondent affirms that Applicant would have no difficulty in recouping the amount of the Award if the continuation of the stay of enforcement would be denied and the Application would succeed. Respondent refers in support to its unblemished record of payment of ICSID awards and fulfillment of its international obligations.\n\n51.\n\nThe Committee has no reason to doubt the statements of Respondent according to which Applicant, if stay of enforcement is refused, would eventually be able to recover the amount of the Award should the Application succeed and the Award be annulled. As regards Respondent\u2019s enforcement of the Award, the Committee also notes that, in the words of Respondent, Applicant is bankrupt but has very rich backers, a fact which the Committee is not in a position to evaluate.\n\n52.\n\nSome *ad hoc* annulment committees have found that the delay in enforcement is compensated by the interest that accrues on the amount of the award during the stay. Respondent has argued that in this case it would not be fully compensated because the Award does not order payment of compound interest. This is a consequence of the terms of the Award. In the view of the Committee, it is not up to the Committee to improve on the terms of the Award because of granting a continuation of a stay of enforcement.\n\n53.\n\nA further argument of Respondent against the Stay Request is that enforcement brings closure. While the Committee appreciates the desire of parties to a judicial proceeding to reach closure, in the instant case the Committee does not find the argument convincing since enforcement of the Award would not bring *this* proceeding to closure.\n\n54.\n\nTo conclude, on balance, the Committee is of the view that Applicant\u2019s interest in a continued stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceeding should be given more weight than Respondent\u2019s interest in immediate enforcement. In this respect, the Committee also takes into account that, according to the current plans for the annulment proceeding, the continued stay of enforcement can be expected to be of relatively short duration. The Committee therefore finds that the Stay Request should be granted and will turn now to whether it should be subject to any conditions.\n\n55.\n\nThe power of the Committee to impose conditions on the stay of enforcement is not in dispute. Such power has been assumed in prior cases and has also been confirmed by an *ad hoc* annulment committee on a rare occasion when it had been disputed by a party.10 The Committee is mindful that the jurisprudence of ICSID varies and includes decisions which require some form of security as a condition for granting a continuation of a stay of enforcement as well as decisions which do not impose such a requirement.\n\n*Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case ARB/01/3) Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, para. 22 and ff\n\n56.\n\nAs a general matter it is useful to recall that a party in an ICSID arbitration, whether it be a state or a private party, has no right under the ICSID Convention to protection from enforcement efforts while pursuing an annulment proceeding. In the instant case Applicant would draw a benefit to which it has no right and for which a cost may be imposed in some form of assurance to comply with the Award should the Application be dismissed. The assurance imposed would simply serve the purpose of balancing the rights of the parties as a counterpart to the benefit that would be granted to Applicant.\n\n57.\n\nApplicant has argued that, if security would be required for the continuation of the stay, it would imply acceptance by the Committee of the alleged illegal activities of Respondent. The Committee disagrees. By requiring security, the Committee would not approve or accept any activities of Respondent on which, moreover, the Committee cannot at this stage express any opinion. The issue to be determined by the Committee is whether, in the circumstances of the present case, to impose a security on Applicant would be the appropriate means to balance the rights of the parties.\n\n58.\n\nThe Committee recalls that it is common ground between the Parties that Libananco has no significant assets. As noted by Respondent during the Hearing, \"Nor is there any prospect that Turkey, in the absence of voluntary compliance, would ever be able to enforce the costs award against Libananco. The company is a mere shell; as the evidence shows, it has no assets [...]\" *[Minutes of the First Session of the* Ad Hoc *Committee,* P:56;L13-17], Applicant itself asserted that (a) \"$15 million required to be paid by a company whose assets have been expropriated is an enormous economic burden\" *[Minutes of the First Session of the* Ad Hoc **Committee,** P:71; L21-23] and (b) \"the prospect of compliance, if that is a standard of the criteria, the Respondent hasn\u2019t even talked about Libananco, other than to say it doesn\u2019t have any assets. Well, Respondent is stripped [sic] of its assets\" *[Minutes of the First Session of the* Ad Hoc **Committee,** P:72; LI 4-18].\n\n59.\n\nThe Committee notes, on the one hand, that a requirement to post security would be likely to be burdensome for Applicant in view of its scarce financial means. Moreover, the Committee is not in possession of information on the basis of which it can reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s backers should be expected to provide means for this purpose.\n\n60.\n\nOn the other hand, the Committee finds no evidence showing that Respondent\u2019s chances of obtaining enforcement of the Award would deteriorate as a result of the stay of enforcement, if the Application should eventually be rejected. For this reason, the stay of enforcement cannot be expected to place a heavy burden on Respondent.\n\n61.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Committee is of the view that requiring security would affect Applicant\u2019s situation in a disproportionate manner and that the stay of enforcement should not be subject to any such condition.\n\n62.\n\nFinally, the Committee finds no basis for Applicant\u2019s request that Section 3.3 of Respondent\u2019s Observations of 23 March 2012 be struck from the record and concludes that this request must be rejected.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\n63.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee decides:\n\n(a) To continue unconditionally the stay of enforcement until the Committee decides on the Application.\n\n(b) To reserve its decision on costs related to the Stay Request for a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n(c) To reject Applicant\u2019s request that Section 3.3 of Respondent\u2019s Observations of March 23, 2012 be struck from the record."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2013-05-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 12, 2011, Libananco Holdings Co. Limited (\"Applicant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application requesting the annulment of the award rendered on September 2, 2011 (\"Award\") in the case between Applicant (\"Claimant\" in the original proceedings) and the Republic of Turkey (\"Respondent\"). The application (\"Application\") was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n2.\n\nUnder Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the Arbitration Rules, the Application contained a request for a stay of enforcement of the Award, concerning the amount of US$15,602,500.00 and interest in favor of Respondent.\n\n3.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, the Secretary-General informed the parties that the Application had been registered on that date. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules, enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of February 14, 2012, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the parties that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"Committee\") had been constituted - composed of Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (Spanish) as President, and Judge Hans Danelius (Swedish) and Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero (Colombian and French) as Members - and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The parties were also informed that Ms. Martina Polasek would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the Committee invited Applicant to file the reasons for the request for stay of enforcement of the Award by March 2, 2012 and Respondent to file its observations thereon within fourteen days from Applicant\u2019s submission of reasons. The Committee received Applicant\u2019s statement of reasons for the continued stay of enforcement on March 2, 2012 and, after an extension, Respondent\u2019s observations on the Applicant\u2019s request on March 23, 2012.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 14, 2012, Applicant filed a Request for Provisional Measures. By letter of March 15, 2012, the Committee invited Respondent to file its observations on the Request for Provisional Measures by March 23, 2012. The Committee received Respondent\u2019s observations on March 23, 2012, a reply by Applicant on March 29, 2012 and a rejoinder by Respondent on April 9, 2012.\n\n7.\n\nBy agreement of the parties the Committee held its first session in Paris, France, on April 11, 2012. Present at the session were:\n\nAttending on behalf of Applicant\n\n[...]\n\nAttending on behalf of Respondent\n\n[...]\n\n8.\n\nThe parties made two rounds of oral submissions on Applicant\u2019s requests for stay of enforcement of the Award and provisional measures. They also agreed on a number of procedural matters. Among other things, it was agreed that the place of proceedings would be Washington, D.C. and that the applicable arbitration rules would be the Arbitration Rules in force as of April 10, 2006.\n\n9.\n\nOn May 7, 2012, the Committee issued its Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award. The Committee decided to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award until the Committee\u2019s final decision on the Application. While the Committee noted that the parties did not dispute the power to impose conditions on the stay of enforcement, it rejected Respondent\u2019s request that a continued stay should be conditional on the provision of security. It noted that it was common ground that Applicant had no significant assets and that it could not reasonably conclude, based on the information before the Committee, that Applicant\u2019s financial backers should be expected to provide security. It further found that there was no evidence that Respondent\u2019s chances of obtaining enforcement of the Award would deteriorate as a result of the stay of enforcement, if the Application should eventually be rejected. It balanced the impacts of a continued unconditional stay of enforcement and a conditional stay with security, concluding that requiring security in this case would affect Applicant\u2019s situation in a disproportionate manner.\n\n10.\n\nAlso on May 7, 2012, the Committee issued its Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures. Applicant had requested that the Committee issue protective orders relating to Respondent\u2019s alleged illicit espionage of Applicant, its representatives, its counsel, witnesses and experts in the underlying arbitration. According to Applicant, the requested provisional measures derived directly from the findings of fact and determinations made by the Tribunal in the underlying arbitration. Respondent allegedly continued its espionage following certain protective orders issued by the Tribunal on May 1, 2008. The Committee stated that it was doubtful that it had the power to rule on a request for provisional measures in view of the absence of a specific reference in Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention to Article 47 of the Convention dealing with provisional measures.1 However, the Committee found that Applicant had in any event not established the need for such measures in order to preserve its rights in the proceedings before the Committee. Without evidence that Respondent was engaging in activities harmful to Applicant\u2019s procedural rights or interests in the annulment proceeding, the Committee could not find a sufficient basis for issuing orders identical to those which were issued by the Tribunal in 2008.\n\nArticle 52(4) of the Convention provides that \"the provisions of Article 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn May 9, 2012, Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment (\"Memorial\"), accompanied by 91 exhibits and legal authorities (C-285 to C-379), as well as expert reports of [...] (C-331), [...] (C-370) and [...] (C-377). Following a request by Respondent, Applicant produced the originals in Turkish of Exhibits C-305 and C-340.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (\"Counter-Memorial\"), including 55 exhibits (R-1073 to R-l 127) and 14 legal authorities (RLA-13 to RLA-26) and an expert report of [...].\n\n13.\n\nOn August 22, 2012, Applicant filed a Reply on Annulment (\"Reply\") with exhibits and legal authorities (C-380 to C-397), including a second expert report of [...] and an expert report of [...].\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of September 3, 2012, Respondent requested that the expert reports of [...] be declared inadmissible and struck from the record of the annulment proceeding because they were new evidence on the subject matter of the parties\u2019 underlying dispute concerning a key issue on jurisdiction. Filing the expert reports for the first time in the annulment proceeding was, according to Respondent, meant to reopen the subject matter of the dispute before the Tribunal, countering the purpose of the annulment process.\n\n15.\n\nApplicant responded to Respondent\u2019s motion of September 3, 2012 by letter of September 12, 2012, arguing that Respondent\u2019s request had no legal basis under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Applicant further stated that the three expert reports were relevant to one ground of annulment (Article 52(2)(b)) in this case and that Respondent\u2019s motion must therefore be rejected.\n\n16.\n\nThe Committee ruled on the admissibility of the three expert reports in its Procedural Order No. 1 dated September 17, 2012. The Committee made a *prima facie* finding that the expert reports might have some bearing on whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. It therefore rejected Respondent\u2019s motion but decided to consider the expert reports only to the extent that they were relevant to the grounds for annulment pleaded by Applicant.\n\n17.\n\nOn September 21, 2012, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Annulment (\"Rejoinder\"), accompanied by 12 exhibits (R-1128 to R-1139) and 5 legal authorities (RLA-27 to RLA-31), a second export report of [... ] and an expert opinion of [... ].\n\n18.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, pursuant to the Committee\u2019s directions, the parties exchanged letters on whether or not they wished to cross-examine the other party\u2019s experts. Respondent requested the cross-examination of [...] while Applicant declined to cross-examine Respondent\u2019s experts.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 11, 2012, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing telephone conference with the parties concerning the organization of the hearing on annulment. Following the telephone conference, the President deliberated with the co-members on a number of disputed issues. The Committee\u2019s decisions were included in its Procedural Order No. 2 of December 13, 2012. Among other things, it was decided that [...] would be heard via video link at The Hague, with a member of the ICSID Secretariat present to assist with any documents presented to him. It was also decided that Applicant\u2019s representatives could attend the hearing via video link from the World Bank offices in Paris.\n\n20.\n\nThe hearing on annulment was held at the World Bank facilities in Washington, D.C. on January 14 and 15, 2013. Present at hearing were:\n\nAttending on behalf of Applicant *In Washington, D.C.*\n\n[...]\n\n*In Paris*\n\n[...]\n\nAttending on behalf of Respondent *In Washington, D.C.*\n\n[...]\n\n21.\n\nThere were two rounds of oral arguments and a cross-examination of [...] through video link. At the end of the hearing, it was agreed that the parties would not file post-hearing briefs, but would submit statements of costs and proposed corrections to the transcript of the hearing within 30 days of the last hearing day.\n\n22.\n\nAccordingly, Respondent filed its submission on costs and proposed corrections to the transcript on February 22, 2013 and Applicant filed its corresponding submission on February 25, 2013.\n\n23.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rules 38(1) and 53, the proceedings were declared closed on May 6, 2013.\n\n**II. THE AWARD**\n-----------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Award of September 2, 2011 was rendered by a Tribunal composed of Mr Michael Hwang S.C. (President), Mr Henri C. Alvarez Q.C. (appointed by Applicant, Claimant in the original proceedings) and Sir Franklin Berman Q.C. (appointed by Respondent). It was an award on jurisdiction, finding that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over the dispute and dismissing all of Claimant\u2019s claims. In addition, the Award ordered Claimant to pay Respondent US$602,500 in reimbursement of the expended portion of the Respondent\u2019s advance on costs as well as US$15,000,000 in respect of Respondent\u2019s legal fees and out of pocket expenses and interest.2\n\nThe full operative part of the Award is contained in its para. 570.\n\n25.\n\nThe Award (para. 1) introduced the dispute between the parties as follows:\n\n\"This arbitration concerns a claim brought by the Claimant, Libananco Holdings Co. Limited (\"Claimant\" or \"Libananco\"), a Cypriot company, against the Republic of Turkey (\"Respondent\" or \"Turkey\"), in respect of a number of alleged breaches of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\"), to which both the Republic of Cyprus (\"Cyprus\") and Turkey are Contracting Parties. The dispute concerns the seizure of two Turkish utility companies, Cukurova Elektrik Anonim Sirketi (\"QEA$\") and Kepez Elektrik Turk Anonim Sirketi (\"Kepez\"), in respect of which Libananco holds shares and the cancellation of concession agreements between the latter two entities and the Respondent on 12 June 2003. The Claimant invoked the dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 26 of the ECT and submitted the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\").\"\n\n26.\n\nThe procedural history leading up to the Award is described in its paragraphs 9 to 87, which reflect a long and complex proceeding during which both parties made numerous procedural and substantive requests and filed a significant amount of supporting documentation. Following Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections to jurisdiction and request for bifurcation of the proceeding, on December 17, 2008, the Tribunal selected certain issues to be heard as preliminary questions pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4). The relevant part of the order on bifurcation was quoted in para. 33 of the Award:\n\n\"2. The issues which have been selected by the Tribunal for preliminary hearing... from the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections (R.PO) are:\n\na. Issue V.B (Libananco is not an Investor within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the ECT);\n\nb. Issue V.E (Libananco\u2019s Claims do not satisfy express conditions on Turkey\u2019s Consent to Arbitration);\n\nc. Issue VI.A (Libananco is not entitled to the benefits under Art. 17 of the ECT).\n\n3. These issues have been selected on the basis that they are:\n\na. genuinely preliminary;\n\nb. discrete; and\n\nc. capable of bringing the proceedings to an end;\n\nand can be properly disposed of in summary proceedings without causing undue delay to the substantive disposal of the case if none of the objections was upheld.\"\n\n27.\n\nThe bifurcated issues were described further in paras. 105.1-105.4 of the Award:\n\n\"105.1 First, whether Libananco in fact owned CEA\u015e and Kepez shares before 12 June 2003 (the date of the alleged expropriation). This is the key issue in the present case. It is common ground between the Parties that Libananco would have no standing to prosecute the present arbitration if it did not own shares in CEA\u015e and Kepez on or before 12 June 2003. The Claimant\u2019s position is that Libananco owned the shares in question before 12 June 2003. The Respondent\u2019s position is that Libananco did not acquire the shares in question on or before 12 June 2003, and that the Claimant has failed to prove the facts which it asserts to be true.\n\n105.2 Second, whether Libananco is an \"Investor\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the ECT. The difference between the Parties here is whether Libananco has any real corporate existence of its own, or if it is merely an *alter ego* of the Uzan family, and therefore does not qualify as a foreign investor entitled to maintain claims under the ICSID Convention and the ECT. The Respondent submits that Libananco\u2019s corporate veil should be pierced for the reason given above. The Claimant\u2019s position, on the other hand, is that Libananco is plainly an \"Investor\" within the meaning of the ECT and the ICSID Convention by virtue of its place of incorporation and hence its nationality. The Claimant argues, among other things, that the Respondent has not shown the existence of any rule of corporate nationality that would override the plain definition of \"Investor\" for the purposes of the ECT and ICSID Convention, or that there is any international law doctrine of \"veilpiercing\" that would take precedence in the present circumstances.\n\n105.3 Third, whether Libananco\u2019s claims satisfy express conditions of Turkey\u2019s consent to arbitration. Here, the Respondent relies principally on Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT which states that:\n\n*\"Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give... unconditional consent [to international arbitration] where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute [to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party to the dispute]\".*\n\n105.4 Turkey is a Contracting Party listed in Annex ID to the ECT. The Respondent\u2019s position is that the subject matter of the present dispute has already been submitted to the Turkish courts by the Uzan family and related entities, and that the latter were unsuccessful in their litigation. For that reason, the Respondent has not consented to arbitrate the present dispute. The Claimant\u2019s response is that Libananco itself has never submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Turkish courts, and therefore has never been a party in any Turkish litigation; further, the disputes before the Turkish courts referred to by the Respondent are not the same as the present dispute before this Tribunal.\n\n105.5 Fourth, whether Libananco is entitled to the benefits of the ECT under its Article 17. The Respondent relies on Articles 17(1) and 17(2) of the ECT to argue that Libananco is not entitled to the benefits of the ECT. In broad terms, these provisions deny the benefits of the ECT to: (i) a legal entity which has \u2018no substantial business activities\u2019 in the country in which it is organised, and is owned by citizens or nationals of a \u2018third state\u2019 (Article 17(1) of the ECT); and (ii) an investment which is one belonging to an \u2018Investor of a third state\u2019 in respect of which the denying Contracting Party does not maintain a diplomatic relationship (Article 17(2)(a) of the ECT). The Respondent has accordingly submitted that: (i) Libananco has never had any substantial business activities in Cyprus; (ii) Libananco is owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a \u2018third state\u2019; and (iii) that Turkey and Cyprus do not maintain diplomatic relations. The crux of the Claimant\u2019s position is simply that both Cyprus and Turkey are Contracting Parties to the ECT, and consequently neither is a \u2018third state.\u2019\"\n\n28.\n\nThe Award addressed the first issue, namely whether Claimant had proved that it owned CEA\u015e and Kepez shares before June 12, 2003, over 140 pages. It noted in regard to this issue that it was common ground between the parties that Claimant had the burden of proof (para. 121 of the Award) and concluded as follows:\n\n\"536. For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has failed to meet its burden of proof when all the evidence is viewed as a whole. Although some of the evidence submitted by the Claimant tends to support certain aspects of its case, the Tribunal finds that, in the light of the various inconsistencies, conflicts and changes in the Claimant\u2019s account of the events that occurred, its final description and account of how it came to own shares in CEA\u015e and Kepez is not persuasive. The Claimant has therefore not discharged its burden to show positively that it had acquired, by 12 June 2003, ownership of any of the large quantity of shares in issue in the manner alleged, or at all. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not proved that it owned the shares in CEA\u015e and Kepez, which represent the \"Investment\" in this arbitration, by the critical date of 12 June 2003.\"\n\n29.\n\nAs the Award found that Claimant could not be regarded as the owner of the claimed investment at the relevant time, it stated that it became without object to consider \"whether or not Libananco comes within the class of potential investors under either the ICSID Convention or the ECT, since without an \u2018investment\u2019 there can be no \u2018Investor\u2019\" (para. 537 of the Award). With regard to the third issue, whether the Claimant\u2019s claims satisfied express conditions of Turkey\u2019s consent to arbitrate as provided in Article 26(3) of the ECT and its Annex ID, the Award stated:\n\n\"546. [...] It therefore seems to the Tribunal plain, simply on the way in which Article 26(3) is drafted, both that the limited consent is foreseen and understood to take effect automatically, on the giving by the State in question of its \"consent to be bound\" by the Treaty, and (on the other hand) that the States covered by this provision are definitively identified, once and for all, by Annex ID itself as established at the time the ECT was concluded and opened for signature. It would then follow that the limiting effect cannot be conditional on the statement required by sub-paragraph (ii), either as to the fact of the limitation, or as to its extent; and that is indeed reinforced by the wording of sub-paragraph (ii) itself, with its express indication that the requirement is merely \u2018for the sake of transparency\u2019. It seems rather to be the case that listing under Annex ID has the automatic effect of registering that the original consent of the Negotiating State in question is limited as precisely described in Article 26(3)(b), sub-paragraph (i).\" (footnote omitted)\n\n30.\n\nFinally, with regard to the fourth issue whether Claimant was entitled to the benefits of Article 17 of the ECT, the Award stated that the term \"third state\" in Article 17 of the ECT meant \"state not party to the treaty in question\" (para. 553) and that \"the denying Contracting Party has to *'* *establish* *'\u2019* the ultimate third state nature of the Investor/Investment in order to be entitled to deny him/it the advantages of Part III of the ECT\" (para. 556, emphasis in original).\n\n31.\n\nThe determining conclusion upon which Claimant\u2019s case failed therefore concerned the issue of its ownership of the shares in CEA\u015e and Kepez before June 12, 2003, based on the Tribunal\u2019s assessment and analysis of the factual assertions and legal arguments of the parties.\n\n**III.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nAs noted by the parties, the requirements for an application for annulment are set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which is implemented by Rule 50(1) of the Arbitration Rules. These provisions read in relevant parts as follows:\n\n**Article 52**\n\n(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n(2) The application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered except that when annulment is requested on the ground of corruption such application shall be made within 120 days after discovery of the corruption and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.\n\n**Rule 50**\n\n**The Application**\n\n(1) An application for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award shall be addressed in writing to the Secretary-General and shall:\n\n(a) identify the award to which it relates;\n\n(b) indicate the date of the application;\n\n(c) state *in detail:*\n\n[...]\n\n(iii) in an application for annulment, pursuant to Article 52(1) of the Convention, the grounds on which it is based. These grounds are limited to the following:\n\n- that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n- that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n- that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n- that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure;\n\n- that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based;\n\n(d) be accompanied by the payment of a fee for lodging the application.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n49.\n\nWhile the ICSID Convention only provides that annulment may be requested on one or more of the grounds set out in Article 52(1) and that the application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered (with the exception of the ground of corruption), Rule 50(1) specifies certain formal requirements, including that the application shall \"state in detail\" the grounds on which it is based. The question is what the wording \"in detail\" entails, whether it is sufficient to simply specify one or more of the grounds in Article 52(1) of the Convention on which annulment is sought, or whether there should be some additional degree of detail linking the grounds invoked to sections of the award or actions by the tribunal complained of.\n\n50.\n\nThe *Klockner II* Committee noted that the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules speak only of \"grounds\" and not of \"reasons,\" indicating that there is no requirement that the reasons in respect of the grounds be explained in the application for annulment.6 It recalled that the drafting history of Rule 50(1) of the Arbitration Rules shows that the provision originally contained a requirement that the application contain the grounds for annulment \"together with a detailed statement of the reasons therefore.\" Because the term \"reasons\" was deleted from the text of the provision, it seemed clear to the *Klockner II* Committee that reasons in support of the grounds are not required in the application.7 The *Klockner II* Committee thus concluded that an application for annulment only needs to recite in a detailed manner (i.e. word-by-word) the ground or grounds in Article 52 of the Convention on which the application is based. The *Wena* and *Togo Electricit\u00e9* Decisions appear to support this conclusion, stating that new arguments in support of the grounds for annulment may be raised later in the proceeding.8\n\n*Klockner II,* supra note 4, para. 4.40.\n\n*Id.,* para. 4.34 and 4.41.\n\n*Wena,* supra note 4, para. 19, *Togo Electricit\u00e9 and GDF-Suez Energie Services* v. *Republic of Togo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/7), Decision on Annulment, September 6, 2011, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid, paras. 88-90.\n\n51.\n\nOn the other hand, *Amco I* did not consider a mere recital of the specific subparagraphs of Article 52(1) of the Convention as adequate compliance with Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c).9 According to *Amco I,* the procedure set out in Arbitration Rule 50 should be analogous to that for filing a request for arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Institution Rules.10 The Institution Rules require that the request for arbitration contain information concerning the issues in dispute, which would analogously mean that the application for annulment should contain more than just a reference to the grounds in Article 52 of the Convention. It therefore proceeded to examine the time-bar objections, and to verify whether the \"claims for annulment\" could reasonably be considered as covered by the statements in the application for annulment.11 The *Amco I* Committee ultimately found that the grounds objected to were not really new grounds in the Memorial, \"but were either in fact referred to in the Application or reasonably implicit in the Application.\"12\n\n*Amco I.* supra note 3, para. 46.\n\n*Id.,* para. 50. The *Amco I* Decision refers to the Annotated ICSID Arbitration Rules, Doc. ICSID/4/Rev. 1 (which accompanied the first version of the Rules), Note B to Arbitration Rule 50: \"The procedure pertaining to the filing and registration of an application in accordance with this Rule is roughly analogous to that for the filing and registration of an original request for arbitration in accordance with the Institution Rules. It is, however, especially important that the application adequately identify the award to which it relates and state in detail the grounds on which the particular remedy is sought.\"\n\n*Id.,* para. 51.\n\n*Id.,* para. 53.\n\n52.\n\nThis Committee agrees with the *Klockner II* Committee that the text of Arbitration Rule 50 does not specify the degree of detail required for an annulment application. It finds it difficult to accept, however, that it would be sufficient to quote verbatim the text of Article 52 of Convention or of specific subparagraphs of that Article, such as Article 52(1)(b), 1(d) or 1(e), or simply to refer to such subparagraphs.13 The purpose of the provision, in the Committee\u2019s view, is to provide a basic indication of the substantive grounds for the actual complaint. It should as a minimum refer to a specific defect in the award or in the procedure, *e.g.* that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it concluded that it had no jurisdiction when in fact it had jurisdiction, or that the Tribunal seriously departed from the fundamental rule of procedure that the parties should be given the opportunity to be heard. The statements do not need to be supported by evidence, arguments or reasons, but the gist of the complaint concerning the award or the procedure must, as a minimum, appear, explicitly or at least implicitly, from the application.\n\n*Klockner II.* supra note 4, para. 4.25.\n\n53.\n\nIn this case, paragraph 58 of the Application alone would not suffice to satisfy the conditions of Arbitration Rule 50(1) in so far as it indicates that the Application includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the grounds enumerated in Article 52(1)(b) and (d) of the Convention, reserving the right to amend or supplement the Application. It is not possible to determine from this wording which grounds the Applicant relies on. It is true, however, that the paragraph also refers to grounds set out in other parts of the Application and that to this extent it may satisfy the requirements of Rule 50(1).\n\n54.\n\nIndeed, as shown above (see paragraphs 35 to 38), the Application does provide some context for the grounds on which it is based. It makes clear that the Applicant complains about (i) the Tribunal\u2019s finding that there was no jurisdiction; (ii) a purported failure of the Tribunal to address Respondent\u2019s alleged continued violations of fundamental rules of procedure; (iii) a failure of the Award to mention Respondent\u2019s alleged continued misconduct; (iv) the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of the evidence leading to its conclusion that there was no jurisdiction; and (v) the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the burden of proof. Although the claims were later reformulated and developed in the Memorial, the Committee finds that it is implicit in the Application, coupled with its paragraph 58, that they relate to three grounds in Article 52(1) of the Convention: manifest excess of powers (52(1)(b)), serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (52(1)(d)), and failure to state the reasons on which the award is based (52(1)(e)).\n\n55.\n\nSir Franklin Berman\u2019s alleged failure to disclose a conflict of interest was not formulated as a complaint in the Application, which merely described the fact that Applicant had noted the non-disclosure of Sir Franklin\u2019s appointment in another arbitration also involving one of Respondent\u2019s counsel as arbitrator, as well as Sir Franklin\u2019s statement that the non-disclosure was a regrettable oversight but that it raised no issue as to the independence of his judgment. Since the only relevance of mentioning these facts (which occurred after the Award was rendered) was to use it in support of the Application, the Committee finds that there was an implicit complaint concerning a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure in this respect.\n\n56.\n\nRespondent objected to the admissibility of three complaints contained in the Memorial:\n\na. That the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law (Turkish law);\n\nb. That the Tribunal should have examined, *sua sponte,* other possible grounds for establishing jurisdiction (in particular an alleged equitable interest in the CEA\u015e and Kepez shares); and\n\nc. That the Award was issued too late.\n\nApplying the above principles, the Committee finds that Applicant\u2019s claims concerning the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to apply the proper law in relation to the timely legal interest in CEA\u015e and Kepez and the issue of timely equitable interest fall under the broad umbrella of an alleged failure to exercise an existing jurisdiction over the dispute and are therefore admissible.\n\n57.\n\nThis leaves the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to render the Award within the prescribed time period pursuant to Arbitration Rule 46, leading to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Application, in its section entitled \"Procedural History,\" states: \"Finally, over a year after the close of the proceedings, the Tribunal rendered its Award on 2 September 2011.\" The Memorial adds the following argument:\n\n\"The proceedings in the original arbitration were not officially closed by the Tribunal. This was a serious abrogation from Rule 38 which requires that the proceedings shall be declared closed when the presentation of the case by the parties is completed. To leave the proceeding open would be to render Rules 38 and 46 meaningless.\"\n\n58.\n\nThe Committee does not see how this could be an express, let alone an implicit, complaint in the Application, since the Memorial concedes that the proceedings were not closed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38, and therefore the time limit in Arbitration Rule 46 was not triggered. Rather, the Memorial seems to suggest that the complaint relates to the non-closure of the proceedings by the Tribunal. The Committee does not consider that this alleged departure is capable of falling under any of the complaints in the Application.\n\n59.\n\nEven if the claim were admissible, it would be rejected by the Committee. Arbitration Rule 38 provides that the proceeding shall be declared closed \"when the presentation of the case by the parties is completed.\" In this case, the proceeding on the merits was suspended since the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceeding and deal with its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. The parties\u2019 presentation of their case as a whole was therefore not completed. If the Tribunal would have upheld jurisdiction, the proceeding would have continued and would have eventually been declared closed. However, in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal was not required to close the proceedings.\n\n60.\n\nIn any event, Arbitration Rule 38 does not specify when the presentation of the case is completed, which is a matter that must be left to the discretion of each tribunal and *ad hoc* committee. It is not unusual that, after written and oral proceedings are completed, during the course of deliberations tribunals discover issues that require further presentations by the parties. In the Committee\u2019s view, the Rule was not meant to require an immediate closure of the proceeding upon the last filing or hearing. Rather, each tribunal or committee must be assured, after proper deliberations, that it has all necessary arguments and evidence upon which it has reached or will reach a determination concerning all issues in the case. Closing the proceeding while deliberations are still underway may in fact interfere with the deliberations. This is particularly so when the deliberations concern the question whether or not the case should proceed to the merits, since the tribunal may not have made up its mind about its jurisdiction immediately upon the last presentation in the jurisdictional phase and it cannot close the proceeding if it decides to continue on the merits.\n\n**IV.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***A. Preliminary Considerations***\n-----------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue of whether Applicant has waived its rights is a matter to be considered later in this Decision. The parties do not disagree on whether a waiver is possible under the Arbitration Rules; the disagreement is rather on whether an actual waiver occurred.\n\n78.\n\nThe parties disagree on whether, if a committee decides that grounds for annulment exist, the Committee has discretion to annul the Award. The Committee will not have to address this question unless it first has found that the conditions for annulment are fulfilled.\n\n79.\n\nThe Committee will now set forth its understanding of Article 52 to the extent necessary to decide on the Application and, in particular, in respect of matters controversial between the parties.\n\n***B. Scope of the Review***\n----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe parties disagree on the scope of the review. Respondent has emphasized the limited scope of the remedy of annulment and even more so in the case of a review of a decision on jurisdiction. Respondent agrees with the *Azurix* decision on annulment which in the context of the excess of powers stated that \"by virtue of Article 41, in cases where there is any uncertainty or doubt as to whether or not a tribunal has jurisdiction, that question falls to be settled by the tribunal itself in exercise of its comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence under that provision.\"37 Respondent submits that this holding applies to all grounds of annulment: \"If the tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction was a possible one, it should not be annulled, as it is within the tribunal\u2019s rightful discretion pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.\"38\n\n*See* supra note 21.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 176.\n\n81.\n\nOn the other hand, Applicant asserts that \"[t]he debate has moved beyond simplistic distinctions between annulment and appeal and questions concerning whether \u2018annulment is only available in very limited circumstances.\u2019\"39 For Applicant the question is:\n\n\"whether annulment is available in the present case. The specific question is whether an international tribunal\u2019s failure to maintain or restore equality of arms between the parties, in the presence of on-going admitted illicit espionage by a State to undermine those proceedings, in addition to the other fundamental errors of the Tribunal, means that annulment is available in the present case.\"40\n\nReply, para. 124.\n\n*Id.,* para. 127.\n\n82.\n\nThe Committee does not consider it necessary to decide whether the holding by the *Azurix* Committee in its annulment decision quoted above is applicable to all grounds for annulment. The Committee will only observe that the adjective \"manifest\" applies to excess of powers and that \"manifest\" means \"[...] \u2018self-evident,\u2019 \u2018clear,\u2019 \u2018plain on its face\u2019 or \u2018certain\u2019 as distinct from \u2018the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other\u2019 or \u2018susceptible of argument one way or the other\u2019 or \u2018... being... necessary to engage in elaborate analyses [..I\u2019\"41\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25), The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection under Rules 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, May 12, 2008, para. 84.\n\n83.\n\nThe Committee concurs with the statement of the *Rumeli* Committee on the scope of review:\n\n\"An *ad hoc* committee should not be concerned with upholding the finality of an award or ensuring that the review of the award is as extensive as possible given that the annulment proceeding is the only possibility open to the parties, but should simply act within the confines of the task devolved upon it by the ICSID Convention. It may annul the award if, but only if it deems that one or more of the grounds for annulment set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention obtain.\"42\n\n*Rumeli,* supra note 17, para. 73.\n\n***C. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nFor an award to be annulled on this ground, it must meet two tests: (i) there must be a violation of a \"fundamental rule of procedure\"; and (ii) the departure from that rule must be \"serious.\"43 As is clear on the face of this provision, both criteria are mandatory.44\n\nICSID Convention Art. 52(1)(d).\n\n*See* Schreuer et al, supra note 5, p. 980.\n\n85.\n\nBy referring to a \"fundamental rule of procedure,\" the drafters of the Convention intended to restrict annulment on this ground to violations of those principles that are essential to a fair hearing.45 The *Wena* Committee interpreted the requirement that the procedural rule in question be \"fundamental\" as referring \"to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law.\"46 Thus, the key question in annulment proceedings with respect to this ground is whether the procedure allegedly violated falls within the category of fundamental rules necessary to ensure a full and fair hearing.\n\n*Id*\n\n*Wena,* supra note 4, para. 57.\n\n86.\n\nThe second requirement for an award to be annulled due to a \"departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" is that the violation be considered \"serious.\"47 The *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* stated:\n\n\"In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure\u2019 must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"48\n\nICSID Convention Art. 52(1)(d).\n\n*MINE,* supra note 15, para. 5.05.\n\n87.\n\nRelying on this definition, the *Wena* *ad hoc* Committee further concluded:\n\n\"In order to be a \u2018serious\u2019 departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\"49\n\n*Wena,* supra note 4, para. 58.\n\n88.\n\nThe Committee notes that the parties agree that, as pleaded by Applicant in the Memorial, equality of arms is a fundamental rule of procedure as defined by the *Wena* Committee: \"the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it.\"50 However, Respondent questioned in the Rejoinder the stretched definition contained in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008 and quoted by Applicant in the Reply:\n\n\"basic procedural fairness, respect for confidentiality, and legal privilege (and indeed for the immunities accorded to parties, their counsel, and witnesses under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention); the right of parties both to seek advice and to advance their respective cases freely and without interference; and no doubt others as well.\"51\n\n*Id.,* para. 57, quoted in Memorial, para. 64.\n\nReply, para. 85, quoted by Respondent in the Rejoinder, para. 91.\n\n89.\n\nIn its Decision on Preliminary Issues, the Tribunal extended the list of \"principles affected\": \"For its own part, the Tribunal would add to the list respect for the Tribunal itself, as the organ freely chosen by the Parties for the binding settlement of their dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention. It requires no further recital by the Tribunal to establish that these are indeed fundamental principles, or why they are.\"52 The Committee concurs with the Tribunal in its summary of principles that he at the very heart of the ICSID arbitral process.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Issues, para. 78.\n\n***D. Failure to State Reasons***\n---------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThis ground for annulment is rooted in the understanding that \"[a] statement of the reasons for a judicial decision is widely regarded to be a pre-requisite for an orderly administration of justice.\"53 This requirement is so fundamental that it cannot be waived:\n\n\"A statement of reasons is a valuable element of the arbitration process. The Committee has noted that the Committee of Legal Experts, which was to advise the Executive Directors of the World Bank on the draft Convention, by a vote of 28 to 3 rejected a proposal which would allow the Parties to dispense with the requirement of a reasoned award (History of the Convention, Vol. 11, p. 816). A waiver of the requirement in an arbitration agreement would therefore not bar a party from seeking an annulment for failure of an award to state reasons.\"54\n\nSchreuer et al., supra note 5, p. 996.\n\n*MINE,* supra note 15, para. 5.10. *See also* Schreuer et al, supra note 5, p. 996.\n\n91.\n\nThe fundamental nature of this requirement does not mean, however, that it is an onerous one. In fact, \"[t]he duty to state reasons refers only to a minimum requirement.\"55 As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE:*\n\n\"In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"56\n\nSchreuer et al., supra note 5, p. 997.\n\n*MINE,* supra note 15, para. 5.09.\n\n92.\n\nRelying on this reasoning, the *Wena* Committee added:\n\n\"The ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the **ad hoc** Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the **ad hoc** Committee in *MINE,* this ground for annulment refers to a \u2018minimum requirement\u2019 only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal's duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\"57\n\n*Wena,* supra note 4, para. 79.\n\n93.\n\nIn the present case, Applicant claims that the Tribunal failed to state reasons because it failed to ensure that the equality of arms was respected by not considering in the Award the evidence submitted in Annex I to the Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections (\"Annex I\").58 Respondent has argued that the remedy for Applicant\u2019s claim was to request the Tribunal to decide any question that it omitted to decide under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n\"The newly discovered evidence of Respondent\u2019s continuing violations of the Tribunal\u2019s Orders, submitted with Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, August 3, 2009, Exh. C-301.\n\n94.\n\nThe Committee concurs with the practice of the committees reviewed above and is of the view that failure to deal with a question that would make the award unintelligible may be a ground for annulment. As stated by the *Vivendi I* Committee quoted with approval by Applicant:\n\n\"[...] annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision.\"59\n\n*Vivendi I,* supra note 18, para. 65, quoted in Memorial, para. 73.\n\n95.\n\nThe Committee will consider this question more fully later in this Decision.\n\n***E. Manifest Excess of Powers***\n----------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nApplicant\u2019s third ground for seeking annulment is that the Tribunal allegedly exceeded its powers. An arbitral award may be annulled if a tribunal \"exercises a jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant agreement or treaty and the ICSID Convention, read together, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under those instruments.\"60 This is because \"[i]t is not within the tribunal\u2019s powers to refuse to decide a dispute or part of a dispute that meets all jurisdictional requirements of Art. 25.\"61\n\n*Id.,* para. 86.\n\nSchreuer et al, supra note 5, p. 947.\n\n97.\n\nMoreover, \"[t]here is widespread agreement that a failure to apply the proper law may amount to an excess of powers by the tribunal.\"62 Incorrect interpretation of the law, however, does not normally rise to that level.63 As the *Soufraki* *ad hoc* Committee noted, \"ICSID *ad hoc* committees have commonly been quite clear... that a distinction must be made between the failure to apply the proper law, which can result in annulment, and an error in the application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment.\"64 Allowing annulment committees to overturn incorrect applications of the law was specifically rejected by the drafters of the ICSID Convention because some delegates feared that this would call into question the finality of awards.65 Incorrect application of the law is thus not a basis for annulment except in the most egregious cases where such misapplication \"is of such a nature or degree as to constitute objectively (regardless of the Tribunal\u2019s actual or presumed intentions) its effective non-application.\"66\n\n*Id.,* p. 955.\n\nId,.pp. 956, 959-964.\n\n*Soufraki,* supra note 19, para. 85.\n\n*See* Antonio R. Parra, The History of ICSID (Oxford Univ. Press, 2012), p. 87.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on the Applications by Indonesia and Amco Respectively for Annulment and Partial Annulment, December 17, 1992 (\" *Amco II\"),* para. 7.19.\n\n98.\n\nThe ICSID Convention requires that an excess of power be \"manifest\" in order to qualify for annulment. Annulment committees have differed somewhat in interpreting the meaning of this term.\n\n99.\n\nSome committees, such as the *Repsol ad hoc* Committee, have found that \"exceeding one\u2019s powers is \u2018manifest\u2019 when it is \u2018obvious by itself simply by reading the Award, that is, even prior to a detailed examination of its contents.\"67 The *Wena* and the *CDC ad hoc* Committees likewise understood \"manifest\" to imply that the excess should be obvious or evident:\n\n\"The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"68\n\n\"[I]f a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other\u2019, is not manifest.\"69\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10), Decision on the Application for Annulment, January 8, 2007 *(\u2018Repsol\"),* para. 36.\n\n*Wena,* supra note 4, para. 25.\n\n*CDC,* supra note 28, para. 41.\n\n100.\n\nOthers, such as *Vivendi I**,* have concluded that a tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers if the excess of powers has clear and serious consequences:\n\n\"[T]he Committee concludes that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in the sense of Article 52(1)(b), in that the Tribunal, having jurisdiction over the Tucum\u00e1n claims, failed to decide those claims. Given the clear and serious implications of that decision for Claimants in terms of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and the surrounding circumstances, the Committee can only conclude that that excess of powers was manifest.\"70\n\n*Vivendi I,* supra note 18, para. 115.\n\n101.\n\nThe *Soufraki* ad hoc Committee found that both approaches had merit and should apply:\n\n\"[A] strict opposition between two different meanings of \u2018manifest\u2019 -either \u2018obvious\u2019 or \u2018serious\u2019 - is an unnecessary debate. It seems to this Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantively serious.\"71\n\n*Soufraki,* supra note 19, para. 40.\n\n102.\n\nThe Committee concurs with the *Soufraki* annulment decision in understanding Article 52(1)(b) to mean that annulment should not occur unless a tribunal has exceeded its power in a clear manner and with serious consequences. While the term \"manifest\" would in itself seem to correspond to \"obvious\" or \"evident,\" it follows from the very nature of annulment as an exceptional measure that it should not be resorted to unless the tribunal\u2019s act or its failure to act has had, or at least may have had, serious consequences for a party.\n\n103.\n\nFailure to apply the proper law is one instance of the tribunal exceeding its powers by acting outside of the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. In their interpretation of this ground for annulment, *ad hoc* committees concur in that \"a Tribunal\u2019s complete failure to apply the proper law or acting *ex aequo et bono* without agreement of the Parties to do so as required by the ICSID Convention could constitute a manifest excess of powers.\"72 In the words of the *Soufraki ad hoc* committee:\n\n\"[O]ne must also consider that a tribunal goes beyond the scope of its power if it does not respect the law applicable to the substance of the arbitration under the ICSID Convention. It is widely recognized in ICSID jurisprudence that failure to apply the applicable law constitutes an excess of power. The relevant provisions of the applicable law are constitutive elements of the Parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate and constitute part of the definition of the tribunal\u2019s mandate.\"73\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (August 10, 2012), para. 94. *See also* Schreuer et al, supra note 5, p. 938.\n\n*Soufraki,* supra note 19, para. 45.\n\n104.\n\nThe parties agree in general terms that the excess of power must be manifest in the sense of evident and that the Committee is not entitled to re-evaluate the evidence on the basis of which the Tribunal reached its decision, but they disagree on the application of these principles to the instant case and the matter will be more appropriately discussed later in this Decision.\n\n**V. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Annex I*\n-------------\n\n126.\n\nApplicant relies mainly on Annex I to the Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections. As a consequence, it will be useful to start the analysis by reviewing what Annex I says. The very first paragraph of the introduction reads as follows:\n\n\"Claimant has recently obtained documents which conclusively establish that the \u2018rules of separation\u2019 between the \u2018criminal investigators\u2019 and \u2018any person having a role in the defence of this arbitration\u2019 has not only been breached, but was never followed in the first instance. Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal exercise \u2018the inherent powers required to preserve the integrity of its own process,\u2019 in order to thwart Respondent\u2019s efforts to derail these proceedings.\"87\n\nAnnex I, para. 1, quoting the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008.\n\n127.\n\nIn the same vein, we read: \"With this newly discovered evidence, it is time for the Tribunal to rectify this gross imbalance in the relative positions of the parties in this case.\"88 The Introduction to Annex I concludes: \"The only question before the Tribunal then is to determine the consequences for Respondent\u2019s egregious conduct. In that regard Claimant submits this Annex to the Tribunal with the confidence that it will trigger appropriate procedures and action.\"89\n\n*Id.,* para. 5.\n\n*Id.,* para. 9.\n\n128.\n\nAnnex I ends with the following statement:\n\n\"As a first step, Claimant suggests that the Tribunal direct Respondent, including its counsel and agency representatives, to promptly respond to this submission. Thereafter, the Tribunal may conduct further inquiry on these serious issues, evaluate the submissions of the parties and consider appropriate remedies. \u2018With that, justice will also be seen to be done.\u2019\"90\n\n*Id.,* para. 54, quoting the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008.\n\n129.\n\nIt will also be useful to place Annex I in the context of the arbitration proceedings. Annex I was part of the Applicant\u2019s Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections. It was preceded by the Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008, which appended the May 1 Orders, and was followed by the hearing on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction in November 2009, the Post-Hearing Memorials filed on July 1, 2010 and the Award. At the same time as the Rejoinder and Annex I, Applicant filed two requests with the Tribunal. First, Applicant requested that the Tribunal direct Respondent to cause certain witnesses to appear at the hearing (\"the Witnesses Request\")91 Second, Applicant requested the Tribunal to modify the Procedural Orders of April 6, 2007 and December 17, 2008 for the purpose of joining the quantum with the liability phase of the proceedings (\"the Quantum-Liability Request\").92\n\nAward, para. 56; R-l 109.\n\nAward, para. 55; R-l 110.\n\n***How is Annex I linked to the Rejoinder, the two requests and other submissions?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections refers to Annex I in connection with the statement that \"Respondent's retaliatory measures against [...] - refusing to renew and return his passport, obtaining asset freezing orders because he supports Claimant\u2019s prosecution of this claim, causing him to be placed on the Interpol Red Bulletin list after the arbitration was filed, *e.g. -* clearly are part of its overall pattern of illegal and inappropriate conduct in the course of this case.\"93\n\nRejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, para. 246, Exh. R-l 108.\n\n131.\n\nHere a footnote is inserted (footnote 294) simply saying *\"See* Annex I.\" There is no other reference to Annex I in the main body of the Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, including no reference in the relief requested to any remedial action that the Tribunal might take in view of the alleged \"overall pattern of illegal and inappropriate conduct\" of Respondent. The Table of Contents also ignores the existence of Annex I.\n\n132.\n\nAs to the link of Annex I to the two requests, the Witnesses Request is in part justified by the need:\n\n\"[...] to inform the Tribunal of the most serious threat to the integrity of these proceedings - the lack of ethical separation between those wielding Respondent\u2019s police powers and those running this arbitration. As set forth more fully in Annex I to today\u2019s Rejoinder, it is now beyond doubt that the purported \u2018wall of separation\u2019 between the [...] and the [...] was a fiction, and that these two arms of the state apparatus have coordinated closely on the defense of this case. Worse yet, they have done so in conjunction with Turkish legal counsel in this case [...] \"94\n\nExh. R-1109, para. 11.\n\n133.\n\nReference to Annex I is also made in support of the Quantum-Liability Request. As a reason to justify this request, Applicant considers that joining the quantum and liability phases:\n\n\"would to some degree compensate for the prejudice Claimant has suffered due to the time that has been lost as a result of Respondent\u2019s illicit surveillance of Claimant and its counsel, necessitating critical intervention from the Tribunal, not to mention Respondent\u2019s refusal to submit its jurisdictional objections until the very last minute. Moreover, as set forth more fully in Annex I of Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder filed this same date, it is now clear that Respondent has violated the Tribunal\u2019s comprehensive Orders of last year regarding the surveillance and interception program, and indeed has misrepresented to the Tribunal the purported \u2018wall of separation between the security services and those persons handling the defense of this case.\u2019\"95\n\nExh. R-l 110, para. 4.\n\n134.\n\nThe Committee also notes that Applicant\u2019s Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections of August 3, 2009 was accompanied by a binder of annexes.96 There was no specific reference to Annex I in these annexes.\n\nAward, para. 54\n\n135.\n\nApplicant did not raise the issue of the surveillance and the evidence submitted in Annex I in its Post-Hearing Memorial or in the List of Issues Submitted to the Tribunal for Decision filed with it. In the Petition for Costs filed with the Post-Hearing Memorial on July 1, 2010, Applicant reviews the surveillance activities that led to the May 1, 2008 Orders and, under the title of \"Electronic Surveillance of Counsel and Claimant - Part 2,\" Applicant refers in detail to the contents of Annex I. Applicant concludes by requesting the Tribunal to make an award of costs for the arbitration to date in favor of Applicant.\n\n***Did Applicant request the Tribunal to take further action beyond the two requests filed with the Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections on August 3, 2009?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe answer to this question depends on whether requests filed as part of an annex can be considered a complaint that a tribunal should address. The expert of Respondent has opined that\n\n\"The annexes to any filing as a matter of practice are viewed as vehicles for subsidiary materials in support of the content of the rejoinder. In other words, to make a request or motion and introduce new evidence within an annex to any filing is to my knowledge and in my limited experience both inappropriate and unheard of.\"97\n\nExpert Opinion of [...] of July 20, 2012, para. 72(3).\n\n137.\n\nThe Committee does not disagree in general terms with this statement, but it is of the view that the terms of the document override considerations of form or of nomenclature. While it is unusual that counsel would not seek relief in the Rejoinder in reference to the evidence in Annex I or in a separate request to the Tribunal in the terms expressed substantively in Annex I, the Committee is of the view that the terms of Annex I constitute a request to the Tribunal. Therefore, there is no basis for Respondent\u2019s argument that Applicant had waived its right to raise its complaint in this proceeding. The Committee also considers that the request required a decision or a reply in some other form from the Tribunal.\n\n138.\n\nThe Committee understands that the underlying arbitration proceedings were complex and agrees that Applicant\u2019s request, as a matter of form, could have been presented more explicitly. At the same time, the matter was brought to the attention of the Tribunal in other contexts. During the hearing in November 2010, Applicant reminded the Tribunal that, in addition to the request to join liability and quantum, Applicant had made other filings and Applicant\u2019s Petition for Costs of July 1, 2010 retold the story of the surveillance issue as grounds for the petition.\n\n***What did the Tribunal do?***\n-------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nOn learning first about the surveillance, the Tribunal held a hearing in April 2008. The Tribunal issued immediately afterwards the May 1, 2008 Orders and a reasoned decision appending the orders on June 23, 2008 - the Decision on Preliminary Issues. It is pertinent here to review what the Tribunal said in that decision.\n\n140.\n\nAs already noted, the Tribunal listed the following principles as being affected by the allegations and counter-allegations of the parties:\n\n\"basic procedural fairness, respect for confidentiality and legal privilege (and indeed for the immunities accorded to parties, their counsel, and witnesses under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention); the right of parties both to seek advice and to advance their respective cases freely and without interference; and no doubt others as well. For its own part, the Tribunal would add to the list respect for the Tribunal itself, as the organ freely chosen by the Parties for the binding settlement of their dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention.\"98\n\nDecision on Preliminary Issues, para. 78.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal recognized the right and duty of a sovereign State to pursue criminal investigations but it also held that such right and duty needed to be balanced by other considerations. In this respect, the Tribunal recalled:\n\n\"the well-known saying, very frequently repeated in legal discussion, that it is not enough that justice should be done, it must also manifestly be seen to be done. From that it must follow that, even if Turkey can be excused for not previously having taken steps to ensure the strict separation of its criminal investigations, on the one hand, from the prosecution of this arbitration, on the other, that will not be sufficient for the future. The right and duty to investigate crime, accepted by the Tribunal above, cannot mean that the investigative power may be exercised without regard to other rights and duties, or that, by starting a criminal investigation, a State may baulk an ICSID arbitration.\"99\n\n*Id.,* para. 79.\n\n142.\n\nAs to prejudice, the Tribunal noted:\n\n\"that some of the documents attached to the reports from the [...] and included in Respondent\u2019s submissions to the Tribunal clearly and without any doubt were capable of causing prejudice of the kind Libananco alleges, and that some other such documents were included in a redacted form (presumably designed to counter any supposition of prejudice) though it remained unclear even at the end of the hearing by whom or on what basis the redaction had been undertaken.\"100\n\n*Id.,* para. 76.\n\n143.\n\nIn addition the Tribunal affirmed that:\n\n\"like any other international tribunal, it must be regarded as endowed with the inherent powers required to preserve the integrity of its own process -even if the remedies open to it are necessarily different from those that might be available to a domestic court of law in an ICSID Member State. The Tribunal would express the principle as being that parties have an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith and that an arbitral tribunal has the inherent jurisdiction to ensure that this obligation is complied with; this principle applies in all arbitration, including investment arbitration, and to all parties, including States (even in the exercise of their sovereign powers).\"101\n\n*Id.,* para. 78.\n\n144.\n\nAt the time of the Decision on Preliminary Issues, the Tribunal considered that whether Applicant had suffered prejudice was a matter of allegation and counter-allegation and it believed that the matter did not need to be decided at that point. The Tribunal declared:\n\n\"Libananco\u2019s entitlement to future protection for its agents, counsel and witnesses is clearly not conditional on proof that it has actually been prejudiced in the conduct of its case. As to the future, the Tribunal prefers to leave the matter open, relying expressly on both Parties to do their utmost to give effect in good faith, to the present Orders.\"102\n\n*Id.,* para. 80. Emphasis in the original.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal expressly refers to paragraphs 1.1.6 and 1.1.7 of the May 1, 2008 Orders as foreshadowing the exclusion from future proceedings of any privileged documents or information or any evidence derived therefrom. The Tribunal explains that that exclusion \"will naturally depend on proof of privilege in whatever manner seems to be appropriate in accordance with the particular circumstances, once it is claimed that protected material has in fact been submitted.\"103\n\n*Id.*\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal added:\n\n\"If, as the arbitration progresses, it turns out that the Respondent has used, in any way, privileged or confidential information obtained during the surveillance, the Claimant will be at liberty to bring an appropriate application to the Tribunal. The Tribunal attributes great importance to privilege and confidentiality, and if instructions have been given with the benefit of improperly obtained privileged or confidential information, severe prejudice may result. If that event arises, the Tribunal may consider other remedies available apart from the exclusion of improperly obtained evidence or information.\"104\n\n*Id.,* para. 80.\n\n147.\n\nOn August 11, 2008, the Tribunal issued an Order on several matters including a section on \"Compliance with Orders 1.1.3, 1.1.4 and 1.2 dated 1 May 2008.\" Under this new Order the Tribunal, in order to secure compliance with the requirements laid down by the Tribunal in its Orders of May 1, 2008, directed Respondent to ensure that the [...] identified and destroyed documents \"which derive from interception and which the [...] has retained as \u2018related to the investigated crime or any other crime,\u2019 but which nevertheless also relate to this arbitration.\"105 The Tribunal further directed Respondent to inform the Tribunal that that had been done within 30 days of the Order.106\n\nProcedural Order of August 11, 2008, para. 22.\n\n*Id.*\n\n148.\n\nThe same Order also covered \"The Continuing Activities of the [...]\" related to [...] who acted as the Claimant\u2019s agent or representative and as such enjoyed the immunities laid down in Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention. The Tribunal concluded the Order stating:\n\n\"The Tribunal is in no position on the material before it to determine whether any surveillance that may have taken place of Claimant\u2019s representatives went beyond what is appropriate in the circumstances, or whether current criminal investigations with respect to information properly placed before the Tribunal by the Claimant may raise questions of a breach of Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal is determined however to maintain the integrity of the present proceedings, and to protect the rights of both Parties. The Tribunal accordingly invites the Parties to bring before it promptly, in the spirit of its Orders of 1 May 2008, any well-founded information touching on the status or protection of persons covered by Article 22.\"\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal issued an Order on August 31, 2009 on the Witnesses Request. The Tribunal referred to the issues identified by Libananco in the request and then expressed the view that \"the surveillance/interception of the communications, the way Turkey has chosen to conduct itself in meetings with [...], strategies that the Respondent have allegedly adopted after the alleged expropriation and the coordination between the [...] and the [...] are not relevant to the issues to be heard in the 2 November hearing.\"108\n\nProcedural Order of August 31, 2009, para. 4, Exh. C-341.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal also denied the request in respect of three witnesses, considered unnecessary to make any order in respect of a witness whose statement had in the meantime been produced and treated as withdrawn the request in respect of two other witnesses.109\n\n*Id.,* para. 6.\n\n151.\n\nAs to the Quantum-Liability Request, the parties were informed on September 10, 2009 that the Tribunal was of \"the view that it would be more appropriate to deal with the Claimant\u2019s Request after the November hearing.\"110 On the fifth day of the hearing, the Tribunal President stated:\n\n\"And the question of the further bifurcation of the hearing in terms of separating merits and quantum, we think it is a little bit further removed in the distance because that can only be dealt with after we have dealt with this phase of the arbitration.\"111\n\nLetter from the Tribunal to the Parties, September 10, 2009, Exh. R-l 111.\n\nExh. R-1086(5), Transcript, Day 5, p. 1668, lines 6-11.\n\n152.\n\nCounsel to the Applicant on this point said:\n\n\"Lastly, on the\u2014I don't know if it's lastly, but on the quantum issue, I hear you about the prematurity issue, and I don't disagree with that, but I just want to emphasize in the Request that we submitted to the Tribunal on this, that we noted that it was also tied to some of the other filings we have given to the Tribunal recently, including the Annex 1, which was the more recent evidence we had obtained about the surveillance activities and who was responsible for it. I'm not going to argue it now. We obviously feel very strongly about those things.\n\nI will also note for the record, no one has ever challenged it. No one has ever raised the issue about the authenticity of the evidence that we submitted to the Tribunal several months ago [,..]\"112\n\n*Id.,* p. 1679.\n\n153.\n\nIn the chapter on procedural history of the Award (\"Arbitration Proceedings\"), the Tribunal notes that it dismissed \"the Claimant\u2019s Application for Summary Relief and addressed the Claimant\u2019s concerns concerning intercepts and surveillance through certain protective orders made pursuant to Article 22 of the ICSID Convention, while recognizing the Respondent\u2019s sovereign powers to conduct criminal investigations.\"113\n\nAward, para. 22.\n\n154.\n\nThe other instance in the Award where the Tribunal refers to the surveillance issue is in the context of costs. Here the Tribunal decided to apply the principle that \"costs follow the event\" with exceptions in relation to particular issues which were not won by the ultimately prevailing party. Thus the Tribunal awarded costs to Respondent with the exception, *inter alia,* of \"[c]osts and expenses arising from complaints to the Tribunal by the Claimant relating to the alleged covert surveillance of the Claimant\u2019s representatives, Counsel and witnesses which led to the Tribunal\u2019s order of 1 May 2008 after an oral hearing.\"114\n\n*Id.,* para. 564(a).\n\n***Was it necessary for the Tribunal to take further action in view of the evidence in Annex I?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Committee finds it useful to consider this question in a proper perspective by first recalling the actions taken by the Tribunal on May 1 and June 23, 2008.\n\n156.\n\nIn its Orders of May 1, 2008, the Tribunal decided, *inter alia,* that:\n\n\"1.1.6) All privileged documents and information which have been tendered or disclosed to the Tribunal in connection with Claimant\u2019s application of February 29, 2008 will be excluded from the evidence to be received in this arbitration.\n\n1.1.7) Any privileged documents or information which may be introduced into evidence in future proceedings of this arbitration will be excluded as well as any evidence derived from possession of privileged documents or information.\"\n\n157.\n\nThe May 1, 2008 Orders were subsequently supplemented and expanded by the Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008 in which the Tribunal emphasized the importance of the issues dealt with in these Orders of May 1 and pointed out that they affected principles lying at the very heart of the ICSID arbitral process. The Committee fully endorses the Tribunal\u2019s views on the fundamental importance of these issues and reaffirms the need to proceed effectively against any action by a party which could affect the enjoyment of the right to a fair hearing based on equality of arms between the parties.\n\n158.\n\nIn its Decision of June 23, 2008, the Tribunal issued further detailed instructions regarding the measures Respondent had to take in order to ensure the fairness of the proceedings. Moreover, the Tribunal indicated that, if a need should arise at a later stage of the proceedings, it would be ready to consider further remedies apart from the exclusion of improperly obtained evidence or information from the proceedings.\n\n159.\n\nThe Committee considers that on May 1 and June 23, 2008, the Tribunal acted forcefully and effectively by issuing well-balanced orders and instructions to deal with the serious situation that had arisen and eliminate any negative repercussions on the further proceedings. The Tribunal also made it clear that it would be prepared to react strongly to any continued surveillance or interception in the future. As a result, the Committee does not see what else the Tribunal could have done to preserve the integrity of the arbitral process in the circumstances.\n\n160.\n\nIn Annex I to the Rejoinder of August 3, 2009, Applicant made a new request to the Tribunal for action against surveillance and interception. As stated above, the Committee considers that this was a clear request to the Tribunal which, although it was included in an Annex to a submission, would have required a decision or a reply in some other form from the Tribunal. However, the question which the Committee now has to consider is whether the Tribunal\u2019s failure to react to the request is to be considered a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure which should lead to annulment of the Award.\n\n161.\n\nThe answer to this question will depend on an assessment of the situation as a whole, but there are a few elements to which the Committee attaches particular weight.\n\n162.\n\nFirst, the Committee finds it relevant to establish whether Annex I contained new information of such importance that a need had arisen for the Tribunal to consider remedies in addition to those already provided for on May 1 and June 23, 2008 in order to preserve the integrity and fairness of the proceedings.\n\n163.\n\nSecondly, it should also be examined whether Applicant established in this annulment proceeding with a reasonable degree of likelihood that the facts of which it complained in Annex I somehow affected the conclusion reached by the Tribunal in regard to the narrow ground on which the Tribunal, in its Award, decided that it had no jurisdiction in the case.\n\n164.\n\nThirdly, the Committee, having regard to the fact that the subsequent proceedings were limited to the examination of a few preliminary issues, attaches some weight to the manner in which Applicant itself, at this stage of the proceedings, dealt with the issues it had raised in Annex I.\n\n165.\n\nAs regards the first point, the Committee notes that the gist of Annex I was that Applicant had become aware of new evidence of surveillance and interception of communications. On this basis, Applicant alleged that Respondent had violated the Tribunal\u2019s orders and requested further action from the Tribunal to thwart Respondent\u2019s efforts to derail the proceedings.\n\n166.\n\nAlthough Applicant alleged in Annex I that Respondent had breached the Orders of May 1, 2008 and the Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008, it is noteworthy that the facts referred to by Applicant in Annex I mainly concerned events prior to June 23, 2008. While some of these facts had allegedly been discovered after that date, the Committee finds it clear that events that occurred before June 23, 2008 could not be breaches of the Decision on Preliminary Issues and would therefore not necessarily require the Tribunal to consider any remedies in addition to those set out in the Decision of June 23, 2008.\n\n167.\n\nHowever, there was one document referred to in Annex I which related to occurrences after June 23, 2008. The document is a letter dated July 4, 2008, sent on behalf of the [...] by [...], [...], to the [...]. In this letter, reference is made to the Libananco arbitration, and it is stated that a preliminary preparation meeting had been held in Istanbul on June 26, 2008 and that, in line with the topics discussed at that meeting, photocopies of documents held in the archives of the [...], which could be utilized in the defense, had been made and were attached to the letter. However, there is no information in the letter about the character of the meeting held on June 26, which moreover was only three days after the Tribunal\u2019s Decision, or about the contents and origin of the documents transmitted to the [...]. The Committee therefore does not find it possible to draw any conclusions from this scarce and unclear information.\n\n168.\n\nThe second element of importance for the evaluation of the Tribunal\u2019s failure to react to Annex I is the fact that the Tribunal, in its Award, decided the case on a specific and narrow issue, *i.e.* whether Applicant had proved that it had owned shares in CEA\u015e and Kepez before June 12, 2003. The Tribunal found that, in the absence of such proof, it had no jurisdiction.\n\n169.\n\nIn the Award (para. 121), the Tribunal noted that it was common ground between the parties that Applicant (at that time Claimant) had the burden of proof in relation to the issue of whether it had acquired timely ownership of the share certificates in question. The outcome of the case therefore depended on whether Applicant had fulfilled this burden of proof. The Committee finds that Applicant did not establish in the course of this annulment proceeding that it was in any way hampered by Respondent\u2019s actions in its efforts to present arguments and adduce evidence on the particular issue of the ownership of the shares at the critical time. Conversely, Applicant based its annulment claim because of the espionage actions on general, unspecified allegations which do not permit the Committee to identify if and how Respondent could rely on more procedural arms than Applicant in respect of the ownership of the shares. The Committee also notes that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on this matter was based on a very thorough and detailed examination of the evidence adduced by the parties.\n\n170.\n\nOn the third point, *i.e.* Applicant\u2019s own procedural behavior, the Committee finds indications that Applicant itself, during the latter part of the proceedings before the Tribunal, did not consider the issue of Respondent\u2019s surveillance and interception of communications to be of particular relevance to the jurisdictional issues then under examination. The Committee notes, in particular, the following facts.\n\n171.\n\nOn August 5, 2009 the Tribunal requested comments from Respondent on the Witnesses Request of August 3, 2009. On August 14, 2009, Respondent commented as regards the issue of surveillance:\n\n\"The second topic, namely Libananco\u2019s conspiracy theory about the former [...], the [...] and the Republic\u2019s counsel, hardly warrants a response. The Tribunal has dealt with the surveillance issue, which has nothing to do with the preliminary objections bifurcated for the November 2009 hearing [..,]\"115\n\nLetter to the Tribunal dated August 14, 2009, Exh. R-l 112, para. 11.\n\n172.\n\nIn its August 31, 2009 Procedural Order, barely a month after receiving Annex I, the Tribunal decided that the issue of surveillance was not relevant to the questions to be considered at the hearing in November. On September 10, 2009, the Tribunal decided further to consider the Quantum-Liability Request later on in the arbitration. At the November hearing counsel to Applicant recalled:\n\n\"[...] we have given to the Tribunal recently, including the Annex 1, which was the more recent evidence we had obtained about the surveillance activities and who was responsible for it. *I'm not going to argue it now.* We obviously feel very strongly about those things. I will also note for the record, no one has ever challenged it. No one has ever raised the issue about the authenticity of the evidence that we submitted to the Tribunal several months ago, and it\u2019s not something that Claimant or its counsel has forgotten about or decided is not important. *I know it is very important to the Tribunal based on its prior rulings, and we take it very seriously even today. That\u2019s one of the bases for the quantum addition request [the Quantum-Liability Request].* I just wanted to make that clear for the record.\"116\n\nExh. R-1086(5), Transcript, Day 5, p. 1668, lines 6-11. Emphasis added by the Committee.\n\n173.\n\nApplicant thus seems to have accepted that the issue of surveillance was not of particular relevance at this point of the proceedings and that no immediate action was required from the Tribunal. Applicant rather wished for the record to insist that it was not a forgotten issue, but a matter that the Tribunal would need to consider in the future as part of the remaining proceedings. Because the Tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction, the proceedings never reached the next stage. Applicant did not raise further the issue of surveillance except as a justification for its Petition on Costs of July 1, 2010.\n\n174.\n\nOn the basis of the preceding considerations, the Committee cannot find that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to respond to Applicant\u2019s request in Annex I to the Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections and to address the further evidence submitted by Applicant together with that submission constituted a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Applicant\u2019s claim on this matter must therefore be dismissed.\n\n*(ii) The Appointment of Sir Franklin Berman*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nMonths after the hearing and before the Award was issued, Sir Franklin Berman, member of the Tribunal, and Mr. Jan Paulsson, counsel to Respondent, were appointed to a seven-member arbitration panel in a dispute between India and Pakistan. The appointments to that panel were in the public domain. After the Award was issued, Applicant inquired with ICSID whether Sir Franklin had disclosed his appointment during the arbitration. The Secretary-General requested information from Sir Franklin who replied that he had neglected to inform the parties and ICSID due to a \"regrettable oversight.\"\n\n176.\n\nUnder Arbitration Rule 6(2), arbitrators are required to sign a declaration which reads in part as follows: \"I acknowledge that by signing this declaration, I assume a continuing obligation promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any such relationship [i.e. professional, business and other relationships with the parties] or circumstance [i.e. circumstance that may cause the arbitrator\u2019s reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party] that subsequently arises during this proceeding.\" Under this continuing obligation Sir Franklin might have been required to notify the Secretary-General promptly of his appointment as he recognized in his letter to the Secretary-General.117\n\nExh. C-290.\n\n177.\n\nApplicant contends that \"Sir Franklin\u2019s non-disclosure of his appointment with counsel for the Respondent and the Tribunal\u2019s subsequent failure to address the matter raised justifiable doubts as to the fairness of the underlying arbitration proceedings.\"118 However, Applicant fails to show that the undisclosed information belatedly impinged on the fairness of the underlying proceedings.\n\nMemorial, para. 137.\n\n178.\n\nBoth parties have referred in their submissions to the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration. The Committee observes that the situation of an arbitrator and counsel in one arbitration serving as arbitrators in another unrelated arbitration is not in any of the lists in \"Part II: Practical Application of the General Standards.\" A somewhat similar situation is that \"[t]he arbitrator and counsel for one of the parties or another arbitrator have previously served together as arbitrators or as co-counsel.\" (Section 4.4.2) This situation is included in the Green List, which \"contains a non-exhaustive enumeration of specific situations where no appearance of, and no actual, conflict of interest exists from the relevant objective point of view. Thus, the arbitrator has no duty to disclose situations falling within the Green List.\" (Part II, para. 6)\n\n179.\n\nEven if a failure to disclose occurred, the Guidelines provide that \"a later challenge based on the fact that an arbitrator did not disclose such facts or circumstances should not result automatically in either non-appointment, later disqualification or a successful challenge to any award. In the view of the Working Group, non-disclosure cannot make an arbitrator partial or lacking independence; only the facts or circumstances that he or she did not disclose can do so.\" (Part II, para. 5)\n\n180.\n\nIn the instant case, Applicant has relied exclusively on the fact of non-disclosure and has failed to show that the facts or circumstances relied on by Applicant made Sir Franklin \"partial or lacking independence.\"\n\n181.\n\nAccordingly, Applicant has not demonstrated that Sir Franklin\u2019s lack of disclosure amounted to a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure and, as a result, the Committee dismisses the Applicant\u2019s argument in this respect.\n\n**2. The Award\u2019s Failure to State the Reasons on Which It is Based**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n*(i) Memorial*\n--------------\n\n182.\n\n[...]\n\n*(ii) Counter-Memorial*\n-----------------------\n\n183.\n\n[...]\n\n184.\n\n[...]\n\n*(iii) Reply*\n-------------\n\n185.\n\n[...]\n\n186.\n\n[...]\n\n187.\n\n[...]\n\n*(iv) Rejoinder*\n----------------\n\n188.\n\n[...]\n\n***B. The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Committee observes that, as stated by Applicant, the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) and (e) require different analyses and legal tests, but it also observes that Applicant\u2019s own analysis does not differentiate between the two grounds. Applicant has failed in its Reply to explain what these tests are. Applicant adduces the fact that the Tribunal did not take action on the surveillance issue to restore the equilibrium between the parties and then characterizes this lack of action as a failure to state reasons.\n\n190.\n\nApplicant\u2019s own submission and examples of the determinations that were required from the Tribunal126 show that Applicant complains about lack of decision of the Tribunal on the evidence submitted with Annex I rather than a failure to state reasons. Respondent has argued that the remedy for such lack of decision is to request a decision on the omitted question under Article 49(2) of the Convention and not an application for annulment of the Award.\n\n*See* Memorial, para. 143.\n\n191.\n\nIn the practice of *ad hoc* committees failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) has been linked with varying degrees of intensity to the duty of the tribunal \"to deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based\" under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention. The leading commentary on the ICSID Convention concludes the review of the relationship between Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) by saying:\n\n\"Failure to deal with a question, according to *MINE* and *Wena**,* is not automatically tantamount to a failure to state reasons. This would be the case only if the failure to deal with a particular question rendered the award unintelligible. For other shortcomings in breach of Article 48(3), the remedy in Article 49(2) is available. The mechanical requirement that every argument put forward by a party must be addressed is replaced by the requirement that the reasoning must be coherent.\"127\n\nSchreuer et al., supra note 5, p. 1017.\n\n192.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, lack of consideration of a question submitted to a tribunal could amount to a failure to state reasons if no reasons are given by the tribunal for not addressing the question and such question would be determinant for understanding the reasoning of the award. The Committee shares the view expressed by the *Vivendi I* *ad hoc* Committee that:\n\n\"[...] annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision.\"128\n\n*Vivendi I,* supra note 18, para. 65.\n\n193.\n\nTo the extent that the Tribunal failed to address the question of surveillance in the Award it was of no consequence for the coherence in the reasoning of the Tribunal. It was a matter that had been previously and substantially addressed by the Tribunal after a hearing in April 2008. It was not listed among the issues identified on the Applicant\u2019s Witnesses Request to be considered by the Tribunal at the hearing on jurisdiction in November 2009.129 The Tribunal had been explicit in stating in its Order of August 31, 2009 that in its view,\n\n\"the surveillance/interception of the communications, the way Turkey has chosen to conduct itself in meetings with [...], strategies that the Respondent have allegedly adopted after the alleged expropriation and the coordination between the [...] and the [...] are not relevant to the issues to be heard in the 2 November hearing.\"130\n\n*See* para. 23 of Applicant\u2019s request to examine witnesses.\n\nProcedural Order of August 31, 2009, para. 4. Exhibit C-341.\n\n194.\n\nThe hearing was on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In the view of the Committee, once the Tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction, there was no purpose in considering other issues except to decide on the apportionment of costs. That the Tribunal took into account the question of surveillance is demonstrated by the fact that it decided that a costs order should be made in favor of Respondent minus certain items, including:\n\n\"(a) Costs and expenses arising from complaints to the Tribunal by the Claimant relating to the alleged covert surveillance of the Claimant\u2019s representatives, Counsel and witnesses, which led to the Tribunal\u2019s order of 1 May 2008 after an oral hearing. The reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decision in this regard may be gleaned from its order of 1 May 2008.\"131\n\nAward, para. 564(a).\n\n195.\n\nWhile it is understandable that the Tribunal would not delve further on other matters which became irrelevant once the Tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction, the Committee cannot fail to point out that no explanation has been given in this proceeding as to why there is no relevant reference to Annex I in the body of the Rejoinder on the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, or why no mention of this issue is made in the list of questions to be addressed by the Tribunal in the Award, or why no reference to the issue is made in the Post-Hearing Memorial. This by itself is a strong indication that Applicant accepted the irrelevance of the surveillance issue at that stage of the arbitration proceedings and it is inconsistent with the allegations of Applicant before the Committee.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Manifest Excess of Powers Relating to Failure to Exercise Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n*(i) Memorial*\n--------------\n\n196.\n\n[...]\n\n197.\n\n[...]\n\n198.\n\n[...]\n\n199.\n\n[...]\n\n200.\n\n[...]\n\n201.\n\n[...]\n\n*(ii) Counter-Memorial*\n-----------------------\n\n202.\n\n[...]\n\n203.\n\n[...]\n\n204.\n\n[...]\n\n205.\n\n[...]\n\n*(iii) Reply*\n-------------\n\n206.\n\n[...]\n\n207.\n\n[...]\n\n208.\n\n[...]\n\n*(iv) Rejoinder*\n----------------\n\n209.\n\n[...]\n\n210.\n\n[...]\n\n211.\n\n[...]\n\n212.\n\n[...]\n\n***B. The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Failure to Provide Appropriate Remedies for the Destruction of Equality of Arms Between the Parties*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nApplicant\u2019s premise ignores that the Tribunal provided remedies through the Tribunal\u2019s Orders of May 1, 2008, the Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008, and the Order of August 11, 2008. The Tribunal dealt swiftly with the surveillance issue; it held hearings in April, 2008 and issued promptly the May 1 Orders. These actions of the Tribunal are recorded in the \"Arbitration Proceedings\" section of the Award. The Award also deals with the apportionment of costs, in respect of which Applicant had made a specific petition on July 1, 2010. It is noteworthy that this petition was grounded on the issue of surveillance, including the material in Annex I. The Award does not deal with the new evidence presented in Annex 1 except to the extent that the Tribunal took into consideration the surveillance issue in its decision on costs. Applicant has not complained about the measures that the Tribunal ordered in 2008. The issue of surveillance was not to be discussed at the hearing on jurisdiction as the Tribunal had decided in its Procedural Order of August 31, 2009. Thus Applicant was aware and had ample notice that the Tribunal would not consider the surveillance issue at the hearing on jurisdiction because it was not relevant. Once the Tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction, there was nothing else that the Tribunal could do.\n\n*(ii) Failure to Exercise Jurisdiction Established by Forensically-Tested Documentary Evidence*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nApplicant has insisted that the flaw is not in the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of evidence but in its decision to deny jurisdiction notwithstanding that jurisdiction had been established through forensically tested documentary evidence as evaluated by the Tribunal. Applicant explains that its argument refers to the decision-making process of the Tribunal and not to its evaluation of evidence.\n\n215.\n\nThe distinction made by Applicant is not convincing in the context in which it is made. The Tribunal evaluated documentary evidence and also witnesses\u2019 testimony. The Tribunal determined that the forensic experts were \"unable to provide any concrete forensic evidence to substantiate the allegations of backdating.\"143 When it came to evaluation of the fact witnesses\u2019 testimony, the Tribunal found that \"the Claimant\u2019s case based on the evidence of its factual witnesses [was] highly strained and thus unpersuasive overall.\"144 The Tribunal evaluated all the evidence and reached a conclusion. Notwithstanding the efforts of Applicant to frame the argument as an argument of the Tribunal\u2019s flawed decision-making, the argument remains an argument that contests the result of the evaluation of evidence by the Tribunal. Thus it is beyond the brief of this Committee.\n\nAward, para. 369.\n\n*Id.,* para. 530.\n\n216.\n\nApplicant has also argued that the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof. The Committee will consider this argument in the next section.\n\n*(iii) Failure to Apply the Applicable Law which Established Applicant\u2019s Timely Ownership in CEAS and Kepez*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nIn the Award the Tribunal stated that \"it is common ground between the Parties that Turkish law applies to the issue of whether (and when) Libananco acquired the shares in question and thus had an \"Investment\" under Article 26(1) of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"145 The Tribunal added: \"Accordingly, in this Award, the Tribunal will apply the provisions of the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal will also apply Turkish law (evidence of which has been given by both Parties) to determine whether there has been a valid transfer of the shares in question to Libananco as this is a question of domestic law.\"146\n\n*Id.,* para. 112.\n\n*Id.,* para. 113.\n\n218.\n\nThe flaw in Applicant\u2019s argument is that it is based on the premise that evidence has to be assessed in accordance with Turkish law. Turkish law applied to the substance of the transaction in question as the Tribunal correctly stated, but the proof of documents and witnesses\u2019 testimony needed to be appreciated by the Tribunal not in accordance with Turkish law but in accordance with Arbitration Rule 34(1). This rule empowers the Tribunal to be \"the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.\" In the exercise of this power the Tribunal found that the evidence submitted did not prove the timely ownership of Libananco in CEA\u015e and Kepez. The Tribunal went at great length to examine the evidence submitted. Because of Applicant\u2019s reliance in its arguments on the \"forensically tested\" documentary evidence, the Committee has selected two paragraphs from the conclusions of the Tribunal on whether Libananco acquired ownership of shares in CEA\u015e and Kepez. They show how the Tribunal appreciated the documentary evidence or lack thereof beyond the issue of back-dating:\n\n\"One striking feature of this case, underscored by the nature and magnitude of the transaction and investment in question, is the absence (even in the context of a family investment) of any form of orderly procedure designed to produce an adequate written record and compliance with the legal requirements that had to be met in order to achieve the desired factual result. Indeed, the evidence shows that even basic corporate and legal documents (many of which would be likely to exist if the facts alleged by the Claimant are true) were neither created nor retained by the persons responsible for managing or otherwise involved in Libananco\u2019s corporate affairs.\"147\n\n*Id.,* para. 531.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal further stated:\n\n\"A further weakness in the Claimant\u2019s case is that there is a substantial body of unrebutted evidence that brings into question the dates of creation and/or accuracy of the key documents on which the Claimant has relied to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. For the reasons given above [...], the Tribunal is unable to accept that the STAs and Libananco\u2019s minutes establish (either in part or in whole) the Claimant\u2019s case that Libananco acquired ownership of the shares in question before 12 May 2003.\"148\n\n*Id.,* para. 534.\n\n220.\n\nThe evidence failed to convince the Tribunal. It is not within the bounds of the Committee to analyze the probative value of the evidence produced by the parties.149\n\n*See Rumeli,* supra note 17, para. 96.\n\n221.\n\nApplicant has also argued that the Tribunal reversed the order of proof. In the Award the Tribunal took note that \"in relation to the issue of whether Libananco acquired timely ownership of the share certificates in question [...], it is now common ground between the Parties that the Claimant has the burden of proof.\"150 Applicant claimed that it made an investment under the ECT and the ICSID Convention. It was for Applicant to prove it. There is nothing unfair or unusual in the way that the Tribunal within its discretion established the burden of proof.\n\nAward, para. 121.\n\n*(iv) Failure to Exercise Jurisdiction under the ECT Established Through Applicant\u2019s Equitable Interest in CEAS and Kepez*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nApplicant\u2019s argument is based on a misunderstanding of the Tribunal\u2019s power to determine its own jurisdiction. Applicant assumes that the Tribunal\u2019s power extends to searching for grounds of jurisdiction not pleaded by the parties. In fact, the power of the Tribunal is rather the reverse. The Tribunal at its own initiative had to make sure that it had jurisdiction on grounds pleaded by the parties.\n\n223.\n\nApplicant had not pleaded that the Tribunal had jurisdiction based on an equitable interest in CEA\u015e and Kepez and, therefore, it was not the duty of the Tribunal to search for other grounds on which it could base its jurisdiction. Not only would such conduct elicit claims of the Tribunal exceeding its powers, but it would also imply that the Tribunal could decide on new grounds of jurisdiction without the benefit of the parties\u2019 views. The Committee does not need to say anything further on this matter.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n224.\n\nEach Party has pleaded that the fees and expenses of its legal representation, those of the Committee members and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre be borne by the other Party. Under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) read together with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, the Committee has discretion in deciding the apportionment of fees and expenses of the parties, the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\n225.\n\nAs regards the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, the Committee notes that the recent tendency in the practice of annulment committees is for the party whose application is rejected to bear these costs. The *Azurix* and *MCI Power* committees grounded their decision in this respect on the difference of treatment of the advances for costs made in the Administrative and Financial Regulations.151 While Regulation 14(3)(e) requires the applicant in annulment proceedings to make the whole advance payment to ICSID for the costs referred to in Regulation 14(2), Regulation 14(3)(d) requires each of the parties in an arbitration to advance half of such costs. Following the same logic and since the Committee has rejected the Application, Applicant shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Committee members and the charges for the use of ICSID\u2019s facilities.\n\n*Azurix,* supra note 21, *M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Decision on the Application for Annulment, October 19, 2009.\n\n226.\n\nOn the other hand, an *ad hoc* Committee has a wide discretion to assess whether or not to order the unsuccessful party to compensate the other party for its costs for legal representation and expenses in the annulment proceeding. In the present case, the Committee pays special attention to the fact that annulment was sought on the basis of allegations which raised questions of observance of fundamental procedural rights, including the right to a fair hearing and equality of arms between the parties. Although the Committee, after analyzing the facts of the case, found that there was no ground for annulment, it nevertheless considers that the character and importance of the issues involved were such as to justify the conclusion that each party should bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n227.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee decides:\n\n(a) The Application is dismissed in its entirety.\n\n(b) Applicant shall bear all expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with this proceeding and the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee.\n\n(c) Each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\n(d) Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3), the continued stay of enforcement of the Award ordered by the Committee in its decision of May 7, 2012 is terminated."}]}
