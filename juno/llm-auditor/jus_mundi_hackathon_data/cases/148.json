INTRODUCTION AND THE PARTIES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nClaimants are 108 legal entities established in Germany (including sixty-five limited liability partnerships and forty-three private companies), and eight individuals of German nationality, including Mathias Kruck (the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n2.\n\nRespondent is the Kingdom of Spain (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Spain**\").\n\n3.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**...\"\n\n4.\n\nThis decision rejects Respondent's Proposal to disqualify Mr. Gary Born as arbitrator in the present proceedings.\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 4 June 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Vaughan Lowe, a national of the United Kingdom, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Gary B. Born, a national of the United States of America, appointed by Claimants; and Zachary Douglas, a national of Australia, appointed by Respondent.\n\n7.\n\nOn 19 January 2016, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"). Ms. Mairee Uran Bidegain, ICSID Team Leader/Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nOn 19 February 2016, Respondent filed preliminary objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n9.\n\nOn 14 March 2016, the Tribunal issued a decision dismissing Respondent's preliminary objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n10.\n\nOn 15 March 2016, the Tribunal held a first session by telephone conference.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 30 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 set out a schedule for the jurisdictional/merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nPursuant to Annex A, of Procedural Order No. 1, as modified by agreement of the Parties, the main pleadings were submitted as follows: Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, 28 July 2016; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, 31 October 2016; Claimants' Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 26 April 2017; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, 27 June 2017; and Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2017.\n\n13.\n\nPursuant to Annex A, of Procedural Order No. 1, as modified by agreement of the Parties, the hearing was scheduled to take place from 26 February to 1 March 2018.\n\n14.\n\nOn 13 February 2018, Respondent proposed the disqualification of Gary B. Born, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the '**Proposal**'). On that date, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n15.\n\nThe Parties were also informed that the Proposal would be decided by Professors Lowe and Douglas (the '**Two Members**'), in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4).\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 February 2018, Claimants submitted preliminary observations to the Proposal, to which Respondent responded by 15 February 2018.\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 February 2018, the Two Members ordered that the hearing dates be vacated and established a procedural calendar for the Parties' submissions on the Proposal. In compliance with that procedural calendar, Claimants submitted their Response to Spain's Application to Disqualify Professor Born, on 20 February 2018.\n\n18.\n\nGary B. Born furnished his explanations on 27 February 2018 as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n19.\n\nThe Parties filed a simultaneous round of comments on 5 March 2018.\n\n**C. THE DECISION TO VACATE THE HEARING**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Two Members gave urgent and careful consideration to the question whether it was possible to preserve the scheduled hearing dates of 26 February to 1 March 2018. Rule 9(6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, under which this proposal for disqualification of Mr Born was brought, stipulates that \"[t]he proceeding shall be suspended until a decision has been taken on the proposal.\" The question was, therefore, whether the proceeding could in practice be suspended in order for the decision on the proposal for disqualification to be taken in a manner that was procedurally fair, and then unsuspended so that, if the proposal was ultimately rejected, the proceeding could go ahead as planned. Of course, if the proposal was ultimately accepted, the proceeding would not go forward.\n\n21.\n\nThe Two Members recognised that there was a need to approve the introduction of the *Masdar* transcript1 into the record, and for that filing to take place before Claimants and Mr Born could respond to Respondent's application. That filing could not realistically be secured before 15 February. There would then have been only about six working days available before the scheduled start of the hearing, within which provision would have to be made for Claimants' response, Mr Born's response, additional observations by the Parties, and the consideration and the submissions and deliberation and taking and communication of the decision.\n\n*See infra* \u00b6\u00b629 and 34.\n\n22.\n\nThe Two Members certainly could not assume that each Party had said all that it had to say about the matter. Indeed, Respondent had expressly reserved the right to make further submissions. There was a possibility that Claimants and/or Mr Born might make submissions based upon parts of the transcripts other than those identified by Respondent; and it was possible that new arguments might be developed.\n\n23.\n\nBearing in mind also that under Procedural Order No 1, paragraph 11, communications could be filed in either English or Spanish, provided that a filing in Spanish must be accompanied within two business days by a translation into English, and considering that the Parties needed to travel to Paris some time in advance of the opening of the hearing, the Two Members concluded that they could not guarantee procedural fairness if they were to plan to decide on the challenge prior to the date scheduled for the opening of the hearing.\n\n24.\n\nMoreover, the Two Members could not, of course, know whether the challenge would be upheld or rejected; and a decision rendered a day or two before the scheduled opening of the hearing, even if it were practically possible (which it was considered it was not), could have caused more, rather than less, disruption.\n\n25.\n\nThough conscious of the disruption and expense that might be caused, on 15 February 2018 the Two Members ordered that the hearing dates be vacated.\n\n**D. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAs set forth above, on 13 February 2018, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal proposing the disqualification of Mr Gary Born, the arbitrator appointed by Claimants.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent's letter said that:\n\n*\"The disqualification is grounded upon the, respectfully said, lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, evidenced by different circumstances described herein below and which manifestly preclude the challenged arbitrator from being relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"*\n\n28.\n\nIn the 13 February 2018 letter, Respondent alleged that Mr Born's dissenting opinion in Case No. 2014-03 *Mr Jurgen Wirtgen and others v Czech Republic* ('***Wirtgen'**),* dated 11 October 2017: (i) demonstrated Mr Born's manifestly biased opinion regarding other EU countries' feed-in tariffs, (ii) misapplied the applicable law, and (iii) showed his manifestly biased opinion regarding the expectations derived from highly regulated sectors. The letter alleged that the dissent shows that Mr Born \"has already prejudged the result\" of later arbitrations, including the present arbitration.\n\n29.\n\nThe 13 February 2018 letter also referred to what it said was Mr Born's \"biased examination\" of counsel and witnesses in two other cases, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1) ('***Masdar***'), and *KS Invest GmbH and TLS Invest GmbH v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/25) ('***KS Invest**'*). Respondent sought \"for the sake of good procedural order\" permission to introduce into the record the relevant parts of the transcripts of the hearings in *Masdar* and *KS Invest*, and brief comments thereon by Respondent.\n\n30.\n\nFurther, Respondent stated in its 13 February 2018 letter that:\n\n*\"... the Kingdom of Spain expressly reserves its right to expand the arguments set forth in this Request for Disqualification, in particular after receiving the explanations of the challenged arbitrator in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(3).\"*\n\n31.\n\nOn 14 February 2018 Claimants wrote to the Tribunal asserting that:\n\n*\"Spain's proposal to disqualify Mr. Born is utterly groundless. It is 'based' in its entirety on: 1) Mr. Born's dissenting opinion in an award involving the Czech Republic; and 2) unspecified allegations of 'bias' that Spain says can be found in questions posed by Mr. Born at hearings in other cases against Spain (held in September 2016 and October 2017), but which Spain has failed to disclose on the spurious ground that it needs this Tribunal's 'permission' to submit the relevant transcripts.\"*\n\n32.\n\nIn that letter Claimants submitted that \"it would be a violation of due process and Claimants' right to an efficient disposition of this case if Spain's proposal to disqualify Mr Born were to result in a postponement of the final hearing scheduled to begin in 11 days.\" Claimants also asked in that letter that \"Spain should be required to immediately submit the transcript references to which it refers.\"\n\n33.\n\nOn 14 February 2018, the Two Members invited Respondent to provide a response to Claimants' letter, by close of business on 15 February 2018. Respondent replied on 15 February 2018, stating that its challenge to Mr Born had been issued promptly and as soon as possible, and asserting its \"right to be judged by impartial and independent arbitrators\" which \"also means appearing to be impartial and independent for any reasonably and well informed third party.\"\n\n34.\n\nRespondent's 15 February 2018 letter included the extract from the transcript of the *KS Invest* hearing, stating that because Claimants had asked in their 14 February that \"Spain should be required to immediately submit the transcript references to which it refers\", and because Claimants counsel in the present case were also counsel for the claimants in *KS Invest*, Respondent understood that it had counsel's consent to introduce the transcript into the present case. The request to introduce part of the transcript in *Masdar* remained.\n\n**1. The Basis for Respondent's Disqualification Proposal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe bases for the challenge in Respondent's letter of 13 February 2018 were, in essence:\n\ni. that Mr Born's dissenting opinion in the *Wirtgen* case demonstrated that he has already reached an immutable and biased opinion on issues at the core of the present arbitration, notably on the question of the nature and effect of government commitments to maintain prices paid for electricity, and on the question of the applicability and effect of EU Law;\n\nii. that Mr Born's questioning of counsel in the *Masdar* case and of a fact witness in the *KS Invest* case was intended to obtain admissions on questions that Mr Born had already prejudged, and demonstrated Mr Born's unwillingness or apparent inability to consider alternative viewpoints.\n\n36.\n\nRespondent submitted that Mr Born has already reached firm and incorrect decisions on a number of points of law and fact which are liable to be applied to similar issues in the present case, contrary to the arguments being advanced in this case by Respondent. It pointed to paragraph 47 of Mr Born's dissenting opinion in *Wirtgen* as \"one of the most important\" indications evidencing this. Paragraph 47 states that:\n\n*\"47. **In my view**, it is essential to appreciate this background, both regulatory and commercial. Put simply, the entire renewable energy sector in the Czech Republic (as in **a number of other states**) was based in the commitment of the state, **like the commitments of other states,**  that the prices paid for electricity produced from renewable energy sources **would be maintained unchanged** (except for upward adjustments to reflect inflation) for a specified period of time, **regardless of market conditions or regulatory judgments**. In turn, this provided investors and lenders with the security that was otherwise absent in the renewable energy sector.\"* [Emphasis supplied by Respondent]\n\n37.\n\nRespondent considers this passage to indicate a finding extending to the Spanish electricity tariff scheme in issue in the present case.\n\n38.\n\nOn these bases, Respondent asserted that \"Mr Born has arrived to an immutable conclusion and this conclusion will not change whatever the effort expended by the Respondent to prove or to argue otherwise.\"2 In the view of the Two Members, that formulation of the submission-which will be referred to as \"immutable prejudgment\"-fairly encapsulates the essence of Respondent's challenge as developed through the instances and arguments set out in its submissions.\n\nRespondent's 13 February 2018 letter, \u00b644.\n\n39.\n\nIn its 5 March 2018 letter, Respondent explained that it did not challenge Mr Born because he had decided against Spain in earlier cases but rather because, as would be objectively assessed by any third person, he has prejudged issues relevant to the present case, thereby undermining Respondent's right to present its case to an impartial and open-minded arbitrator. It said that Mr Born's subjective intentions were irrelevant to this question, which concerns the objective appraisal of his impartiality and the question whether there is an appearance of bias. Respondent repeated that the evidence of Mr Born's opinion in the *Wirtgen* dissent, and of his attitude in the *Masdar* and *KS Invest* cases would lead a reasonable third party to find it highly likely that Mr Born would not be an impartial and open-minded arbitrator in the present case.\n\n**2. Claimants' Submission**\n----------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn their letter dated 20 February 2018, Claimants responded to the challenge. The main points made in that letter are that 'prejudgment' of certain legal issues is an aspect of an arbitrator's knowledge of the law, and no basis for a finding that the arbitrator lacks independence, and that an arbitrator's prior decisions in other cases are no ground for disqualification, even if they involve issues similar to those pending. Claimants argued further that neither the *Wirtgen* dissent nor the questioning in the *Masdar* and *KS Invest* cases in fact demonstrate any manifest lack of independence, prejudgment of any issues, or refusal to consider Spain's arguments, and that the factual and legal issues in the present case are in any event different from those in the *Wirtgen*, *Masdar* and *KS Invest* cases.\n\n41.\n\nClaimants' 5 March 2018 letter repeated their assertion that the mere fact that an arbitrator holds views on the legal consequences of a particular fact pattern or has previously decided the same issue in another case does not mean that he will not exercise 'independent judgment'. It also said that the *Wirtgen* case is not the same or even substantially similar to the present case; and it points out that Spain made no objection to Mr Born's questions in the *Masdar* and *KS Invest* cases at the time.\n\n**E. EXPLANATIONS FURNISHED BY MR. BORN**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nMr. Born provided his explanations on 27 February 2018.\n\n43.\n\nIn his letter dated 26 February 2018, Mr Born reiterated his commitments to be both independent and impartial, and to maintain an open mind as regards the issues in the present case, which he said is different from the *Wirtgen* case. Specifically, he said that general comments made in the *Wirtgen* dissent were generic references to situations, not intended to refer to Spain or any other EU jurisdiction. Further, he said that his questioning in the *Masdar* and *KS Invest* cases was intended solely to understand and clarify the evidence and issues being put forward in those cases.\n\n**F. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Two Members have considered all of the Parties' respective submissions, but in this decision, they refer to them only in so far as is necessary for an understanding of the decision.\n\n**1. The Legal Standard for the Disqualification of an Arbitrator**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe proposal for Mr Born's disqualification is made under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 57 reads as follows:\n\n*\"Article 57*\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"*\n\n46.\n\nSection 2 of Chapter IV of the ICSID Convention is not material in the present context. The disqualification proposed in this case alleges that Mr. Born manifestly lacks the qualities required by Article 14(1). Paragraph 1 of Article 14 reads as follows:\n\n*\"Article 14*\n\n*(1) Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\"*\n\n47.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment,\"* and the French version to *\"toute garantie d'independance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions*\" (guaranteed independence in exercising their functions), the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.3\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna, 13 December 2013 ***(\"Burlington** \")* (Respondent's Annex 12), \u00b665; *Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Decision on the Parties' Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, 12 November 2013 (\"***Blue Bank***\") (Respondent's Annex 11), \u00b658; *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, and *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, *Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal,* 22 October 2007 (together \"***Suez***\") (Respondent's Annexes 4 and 5), \u00b628.\n\n48.\n\nImpartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both \"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case *.*\"4\n\nBurlington \u00b666, Blue Bank \u00b659.\n\n49.\n\nIn their submissions, the Parties argued in some detail what the exact roles of 'impartiality' (emphasised by Respondent) and 'independence' (emphasised by Claimants) are in this context, and what the standard of proof is in relation to the question. The Two Members have considered those arguments but are satisfied that they make no material difference to the outcome in the present context.\n\n50.\n\nThe Two Members are bound by the standard set forth in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention. As set forth in past decisions, \"Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.\"5\n\nBurlington \u00b666, Blue Bank \u00b659.\n\n51.\n\nMoreover, both Respondent and Claimants seem to agree that the legal standard to be applied to the Proposal is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\"6 As a consequence, \"the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.\"7\n\nRespondent's 13 February Letter, \u00b666; Claimants' 20 February Letter, \u00b610.\n\nBurlington \u00b667, Blue Bank \u00b660.\n\n52.\n\nThus, the test that the Two Members have applied is whether it has been shown that there are any circumstances that would cause a reasonable third party to conclude that Mr Born cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Those circumstances could include, for example, evidence of partiality, or of a lack of independence from a party or some other interested person, or of a personal interest in some aspect of the subject-matter of the proceedings, or of an unwillingness on the part of an arbitrator \"to consider views that oppose his preconceptions, and remain open to persuasion.\"8\n\nTo borrow the language of the US Supreme Court, quoted by Respondent in its 5 March 2018 letter: *Republican Party of Minnesota v. White,* 536 U.S. 765, 778 (2002) (Claimants' Annex 9).\n\n**2. Application of the Standard to the Facts of the Case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Proposal is based upon the proposition that Mr Born's dissenting opinion in *Wirtgen* and his questioning of counsel and witnesses in the *Masdar* and *KS Invest* cases indicate-and would indicate to a reasonable third party-a degree of partiality that means that he cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\n\n54.\n\nThe Two Members have considered Mr Born's dissenting opinion in *Wirtgen* carefully, in general and with particular attention to the passages identified by Respondent as indicating Mr Born's lack of partiality. The dissenting opinion is tightly focused upon the specific detail of the situation in the Czech Republic and the specific content of Czech legislation and conduct of the Czech Government. It is a long and detailed dissent, with many references to the documentary record in the case and extensive quotations from that record. The dissenting opinion contains a very close and precise analysis, based firmly on the specific facts of the case before the *Wirtgen* tribunal. The Two Members do not consider that it lends any support to the suggestion that Mr Born would not be an impartial arbitrator in the present case.\n\n55.\n\nThe Two Members have considered Mr Born's questioning of counsel and witnesses in the *Masdar* and *KS Invest* cases. Again, they have considered the transcripts from those case generally and with particular attention to the passages identified by Respondent as indicating Mr Born's lack of partiality and his disdain for Respondent's witnesses. Mr Born's questioning appears to them to be in each case an entirely reasonable attempt to clarify the points being presented to the tribunal concerned. It is commonly-perhaps invariably-the case that members of tribunals have in mind some legal or factual issues that they consider are likely to be important for the decision in the case, and which may have been left unclear in the written submissions on the record. In the Two Members' view, far from being objectionable, it is desirable that members of a tribunal put such issues as precisely as they can to counsel and witnesses and give them the opportunity to have a clear answer put on the record. The Two Members see nothing in Mr Born's questioning that goes beyond that perfectly proper process.\n\n56.\n\nIn sum, and taking the submissions of the two Parties as a whole, the Two Members are clearly of the view that there is no basis for the suggestion that Mr Born cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, or is not impartial, or does not have a mind open to the arguments to be presented in this case, or has any bias against Respondent in this case. That finding disposes of the matter, whether the precise formulations of the standard and the burden of proof advanced by Respondent or by Claimants are preferred.\n\n**G. COSTS**\n------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Two Members invited the Parties to make submissions in their 5 March 2018 filings regarding the costs flowing from this challenge. Claimants asked for an order that Spain bear all costs arising out of or in connection with its disqualification application and gave as an interim figure \u20ac124,644.90 for those costs, which they requested permission to update by 4 April 2018. Respondent submitted a cost figure of \u20ac2,515.25, corresponding to nonrefundable travel expenses of Respondent's counsel and its witness (\u20ac1,095.48) and of Respondent's experts (\u20ac1,419.77).\n\n58.\n\nIn addition, the administrative costs associated with cancelling the hearing amount to US$27,198.90, and \u20ac5,220.9 These costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.\n\nThe amounts covered by the cancellation fees, include the following: Interpretation US$27,198,90; venue cancellation fee: \u20ac900; English court reporter: \u20ac4,320,00. The Spanish court reporter did not charge for the cancellation of services.\n\n59.\n\nBefore a decision is taken on the costs arising directly from this challenge, the Two Members wish to receive a more complete and detailed explanation from Claimants of what those costs are and how they arose directly from the challenge rather than from the general preparation of the case, and also a further submission from Respondent on the reasons why the challenge could not have been made earlier. The Two Members invite each Party to file its submission by 30 April 2018. Those submissions will lie on the record, and a decision on costs arising specifically from this proposal to disqualify Mr Born will be taken in due course when other questions of costs are decided. Each Party may respond to the submission made by the other Party at the time that it makes its more general submissions on costs in due course.\n\n60.\n\nFor the reasons given above the Two Members dismiss the proposal to disqualify Mr Born. The Two Members urge the Parties to make every effort to reschedule the proceedings as quickly and as soon as possible.\n\n**H. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n61.\n\nHaving considered all the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the parties, and for the reasons stated above, the Two Members:\n\n(1) reject Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify Gary B. Born;\n\n(2) invite both Parties to file by no later than 30 April 2018 supplementary submissions as specified in paragraph 60 above; and\n\n(3) determine that a final decision on the costs associated with the Proposal will be made at a later stage."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Principles of Quantum", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2022-09-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Zachary Douglas", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Zachary Douglas\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A****INTRODUCTION**\n---------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe dispute in this case can be reduced to a single question: does Spain incur international responsibility under the ECT for changing the level of the state subsidy enjoyed by the Claimants' PV facilities under RD 661/2007? This in turn raises an issue of fundamental importance about the circumstances in which a State must compensate a foreign investor for a change to a regulatory regime when that change is not tainted by any of the traditional grounds for impugning a State under international law (arbitrariness, discrimination, bad faith, lack of due process, and so on). The Tribunal is unanimous that no such grounds apply to Spain's conduct; the sole question is whether the change is a violation of the Claimants' legitimate expectations as protected under the FET standard.\n\n2.\n\nThe reason that the \"solar cases\" against Spain, the Czech Republic, Italy and other countries have provoked controversy is precisely because liability has centred upon the doctrine of legitimate expectations and the contours of that doctrine are far from settled. A close reading of the awards and dissenting opinions reveals that the division in the jurisprudence rests upon two different conceptions of legitimate expectations. The first attributes liability based on a notion of strict liability. If it can be said that the State has made a \"promise\" of an immutable level of subsidy over a particular period of time in a public regulation, and the investor has \"accepted\" that \"promise\" by investing, then liability follows if that \"promise\" is \"breached\". This conception, as the terminology suggests, rests upon an analogy with contract law, which also attributes liability for a breach of contract on the basis of strict liability. The State's public policy reasons for \"breaching\" its regulatory \"promise\" are irrelevant to establishing liability and proportionality-type arguments concerning the nature and impact of the change provide no defence.\n\n3.\n\nThe second and rival conception of legitimate expectations is based upon fault. The State is liable for breach of legitimate expectations only if the public interest pursued by the change in regulation imposes a disproportionate burden on the investor or offends some other criterion of fault (abuse of power, manifest unreasonableness, or the like).\n\n4.\n\nThe essence of my dissent is that a State can only be condemned to pay compensation on the basis of fault under Article 10 of the ECT (or indeed under any other investment protection obligation). I thus prefer the second conception of legitimate expectations as outlined above and the first part of my dissent will explain why.\n\n5.\n\nIn summary: the concept of legitimate expectations has no textual embodiment in the ECT and in investment treaties more generally. Unless it is accepted that arbitrators have the power to legislate for new grounds for liability under investment treaties (i.e. the power just to make it up), then the only path to a doctrine of legitimate expectations through the FET standard is by interpretation. The terms \"fair and equitable\" cannot be interpreted to mean the arbitrators' subjective notions of what is fair and equitable on any given day. But the FET standard can conceivably be interpreted as encompassing general grounds for liability in damages against public authorities as recognised by the major legal systems of the world (or by \"*civilised nations*\" if the more archaic language of Article 38 of the ICJ's Statute is to be preferred). No legal system imposes strict liability in damages for a breach of legitimate expectations; it is always based on fault. There is no reason in principle for international investment law to take a radically different approach.\n\n6.\n\nThe failure to incorporate an element of fault into the assessment of legitimate expectations in many decisions has led to the creation of a unique no-fault compensation scheme for foreign investors disappointed with the profitability of their projects. There is no evidence to suggest that state parties to investment treaties ever envisaged such a possibility and there is no legal or moral justification for tribunals to redistribute public funds on this basis.\n\n7.\n\nThe second part of my dissent addresses the point as to whether the Claimants in this case could have had a legitimate expectation that the state subsidy allocated by RD 661/2007 was immutable over the period in question.\n\n8.\n\nIt would have been more logical to address these points in reverse order because if there was no legitimate expectation on the facts of this case, then the more general question relating to whether liability is strict or based on fault would not arise. But as this general question is critical to the coherent development of investment law and its sustainability in the future, it is defensible to address it first.\n\n**B****THE PROPER TEST FOR LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**B1** **The majority's formulation of the test for legitimate expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe majority has interpreted the text of RD 661/2007 as giving rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Claimants that the \"*fundamental characteristics*\"1 of the regime for renumerating investment in PV facilities would not change. The critical factors that led the majority to that conclusion are set out in the following passage:\n\nAt least in circumstances where the explicitly declared purpose of legislation is to invite investors to commit capital to projects in reliance upon guarantees of stability in a regulatory regime, specific commitments can be made by provisions in general legislation. This is particularly the case in circumstances where, as here, the great majority of capital costs in an investment are incurred rights at the beginning of the project and are to be recouped over the operating lifetime of the project.2\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Principles of Quantum, \u00a7202.\n\nDecision, \u00a7189.\n\n10.\n\nThe sense of the majority's use of the concept \"*reliance*\" is akin to the Claimants' \"acceptance\" of an \"offer\" of a certain subsidy regime in RD 661/2007. In the words of the majority: \"*RD 661/2007 was indeed intended to induce investments in the renewable energy sector by promising attractive and stable regulated tariffs and premiums, and* [\u2026] *it constituted an invitation to potential investors to rely upon that promise.*\"3 This is obviously the language of contract law and the analogy with the contractual position is made explicit in the majority's reasoning:\n\nThe question here is whether Spain had committed itself to refrain from exercising its undoubted power in a particular manner, so that if it chose to exercise its power in a manner that breached that commitment it may incur liability for losses suffered by those who acted in reliance upon the commitment. There is nothing particularly arcane about this question: it is essentially the mirror image of the question whether a State can, *consistently with the FET provision in ECT Article 10*, bind itself to perform a contract, in a manner that cannot be undone by the State enacting legislation that purports to abrogate its contractual obligations.4\n\nDecision, \u00a7190.\n\nDecision, \u00a7199 (emphasis in the original).\n\n11.\n\nThe majority's conception of an action for breach of legitimate expectations is actually indistinguishable from an action for breach of contract. Both rest upon a notion of strict liability: if a promise is made and is then breached, then liability for any losses follows from that breach, and the reasons for the conduct resulting in that breach are irrelevant. The majority thus does not admit of any defence to this action: if the investor has suffered loss as a result of the breach of the commitment or promise, then liability is established. This is strict liability. No public interest or proportionality defence can therefore be raised; indeed, elsewhere in its Decision, the Tribunal says this:\n\nThe incentives offered by the RD 661/2007 scheme were not compatible with the (equally reasonable) Spanish policy on prices to be charged to electricity consumers and on the balancing of the budget. Something plainly needed to change; and the new regulatory regime was in its own terms an inherently reasonable and pragmatic response to the exigencies of the urgent and unsustainable position.5\n\nDecision, \u00a7259.\n\n12.\n\nThe measures adopted by Spain to change RD 661/2007 were thus unimpeachable based on the traditional grounds of liability under international law (arbitrariness, discrimination, bad faith, and so on). Liability in this case is instead justified by the majority on the basis of a breach of a \"*promise*\" of stability in respect of the \"*fundamentals*\" of the regulatory regime.6\n\nDecision, \u00a7\u00a7190, 200, 202.\n\n13.\n\nThe majority's conception of an action for breach of legitimate expectations is also indistinguishable from an action for breach of contract in terms of the assessment of damages. The remedy that follows from the breach is to put the Claimants in the position that they would have found themselves in if the commitment or promise in RD 661/2007 had been performed.7 That is the contractual model of compensation for expectation damages.\n\nDecision, \u00a7357.\n\n14.\n\nIt is also important to be clear about the conception of \"*reliance*\" deployed by the majority. It is not detrimental reliance: there is no dispute that the Claimants' capital costs will be recouped over the lifetime of their projects together with a return despite the abrogation of the regime in RD 661/2007 (although the extent of that return is hotly contested by the quantum experts). In other words, the Claimants' reliance interest is protected despite the change in regulation. The only type of interest at stake here is the Claimants' expectation of a certain level of profits based upon a certain level of subsidy.\n\n15.\n\nThe difference between the protection of a reliance interest and the protection of an expectation interest is fundamental. Investment treaty law, like administrative law, must search for a balance between the State's duty to change a regulation when the public interest demands it and the interests of individuals who have relied on that regulation to plan their affairs. In administrative law, courts are far more likely to award a remedy for breach of a legitimate expectation to protect a reliance interest because that can be more easily reconciled with preserving the State's mandate and discretion to act in the public interest.8 (As the State's taxpayers will not bear the burden of compensating parties for their losses based on expectations as opposed to detrimental reliance, the State is less likely to be fettered in acting in the public interest.) A public authority is, for example, more likely to refuse to renew a licence to operate a noisy restaurant that disturbs the neighbours if the damages payable are limited to the operator's wasted expenditure on the lease of the premises rather than expected profits over the period of the licence renewal.\n\nSee generally: D Barak-Erez, 'The Doctrine of Legitimate Expectations and the Distinction between the Reliance and Expectation Interests' (2005) 11 *European Public Law* 583.\n\n16.\n\nNo authority is cited by the majority for the central propositions of their decision as set out above. There is no explanation as to how, by applying the standard rules of treaty interpretation, this conception of legitimate expectations is embedded (implicitly) in the FET standard in Article 10 ECT. Where does the majority's conception come from and how is it compatible with the basic architecture of an investment treaty and the fundamental principles of state responsibility towards foreign investors? Their decision is silent on these matters.\n\n**B2** **Can recourse to a concept of legitimate expectations be defended?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThese questions are not raised in order to split hairs. In the absence of a power to legislate, arbitrators must defend their interpretations of the investment protection standards by reference to the normal canons of treaty interpretation as set out in Articles 31 and 32 VCLT. This is a point made expressly in the award in *Philip Morris v Uruguay*\u2014the principal authority referred to by the majority in respect of the FET standard.9 How does one construct a bridge between the text of Article 10 ECT and the concept of legitimate expectations as a ground for liability in damages?\n\n*Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl and others v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016, \u00a7317 (\"*Philip Morris*\").\n\n18.\n\nThe only bridge that seems plausible, and it is far from uncontroversial, is to say that the doctrine of legitimate expectations is a \"*general principle of law recognised by civilised nations*\" in the sense of Article 38 ICJ Statute that can then qualify as a \"*relevant rule of international law applicable in the relations between the parties*\" for the purposes of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT. The controversy stems from the fact that general principles of law are not necessarily rules of international law, and the doctrine of legitimate expectations may not qualify as a general principle of law in any case because it is far from being universally recognised (Australia and France, for instance, do not recognise a doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations and in many other jurisdictions, such as England, there would be no remedy in damages for a breach). I will assume that these hurdles can be overcome. There are compelling pragmatic reasons to do so: if inspiration cannot be drawn from comparative law in giving content to the FET standard, then the popular alternative, which is for arbitrators just to make it up, may prove to be irresistible. Indeed, it was precisely this potential mischief that motivated the drafters of the Statute of the PCIJ to include the possibility of having recourse to \"*general principles of law recognised by civilized nations*\" in the first place:\n\n[I]t would impose on the judges a duty which would prevent them from relying too much on their subjective opinion; it would be incumbent on them to consider whether the dictates of their own conscience were in agreement with the conception of justice of civilized nations.10\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice, Advisory Committee of Jurists, Proc\u00e8s-verbaux of the Proceedings of the Committee June 16th-July 24th 1920, with Annexes (1920), p. 311.\n\n19.\n\nDrawing inspiration from comparative law in developing international rules for the protection of foreign property and other interests has a distinguished history. The celebrated Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens11 uses the following formulation in several articles to delineate lawful from unlawful state conduct: \"*it is not an unreasonable departure from the principles of justice recognized by the principal legal systems of the world*\".12 More specific references to comparative law are also tailored to particular types of wrongs, such as an unlawful arrest or detention: \"*if the cause or manner of the arrest or detention unreasonably departs from the principles recognized by the principal legal systems of the world*\".13\n\nLB Sohn & RB Baxter, 'Responsibility of States for Injuries to the Economic Interests of Aliens' (1961) 55 *AJIL* 545, 548.\n\nHarvard Draft Convention, Arts 9(2)(c), 10(5)(c), 12(1)(c), 4(b).\n\nHarvard Draft Convention, Art. 5(1)(b). See also: Arts 6(b), 7(f), (k), 8(b), 13(1)(b).\n\n20.\n\nA different approach was taken by the tribunal in *Philip Morris*, which appeared to suggest that a doctrine of legitimate expectations could form part of customary international law and customary international law is undoubtedly part of the \"*relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties*\" for Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.14 The ICJ may have subsequently poured cold water on that idea by stating that \"*in general international law [there is no] principle that would give rise to an obligation on the basis of what could be considered a legitimate expectation*\".15\n\n*Philip Morris*, \u00a7\u00a7317-324.\n\n*Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v Chile), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2018*, p. 507, \u00a7162.\n\n21.\n\nMy working assumption for the purposes of this dissent, however, is that the FET standard in Article 10 ECT does include a concept of legitimate expectations. But the legitimacy of referring to that concept depends entirely on fidelity to how it is employed in comparative law. One cannot legitimately have recourse to a general principle of law in the interpretation of the FET standard and deploy that principle as a ground for liability and at the same time denude it of its essential characteristics in comparative law. That is no different to just making it up under the shade of a fig leaf. It is legitimate to have recourse to a general principle of law providing a ground upon which a public authority might be liable in damages in the context of interpreting and applying the FET standard because the state parties to the investment treaty can be taken to accept that their conduct be adjudged by reference to a general principle of law that they both recognise in their own legal systems. That does not exclude the possibility that adjustments may need to be made so that the general principle of law can fit the architecture of the investment treaty and general rules of responsibility in international law. But those adjustments need to be justified in a principled and transparent fashion. And they cannot transcend the consent of the state parties as manifested in their adherence to Article 10 ECT.\n\n22.\n\nOne adjustment that cannot be justified is to transform the doctrine of legitimate expectations from a fault-based ground for liability in damages to a ground of strict liability. This is where I definitively part ways with the majority.\n\n23.\n\nThe majority has not provided reasons for its preference for strict liability and hence I cannot join issue on this point. What I can do, however, is demonstrate why the majority's conflation of a regulatory relationship in public law with a contractual relationship in private law is misguided.\n\n**B3** **A public regulatory relationship cannot be equated with a private contractual relationship**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nSuppose a private contract between an investor and a state party were to include the following clause: \"*this contract is subject to unilateral modification by the government*\". We would be surprised to encounter such a clause and the question would arise as to whether this were really a contract at all. The conferral of a power upon one party to alter the contractual bargain at will is incompatible with the whole purpose of the institution of contract, which is to give the force of law to promises made by the parties in their future relations.\n\n25.\n\nSuppose now a public regulation were to include the following provision: \"*this regulation is subject to unilateral modification by the government*\". Such a clause would also raise eyebrows but for a very different reason. The perplexity this time would be the superfluity of such a provision: of course the regulation can be modified by the government from time to time; the government would fail in its public duties if it did not modify regulations to take account of new developments relating to the thing being regulated. And as the government is the only \"party\" to the regulation, both the enactment and subsequent modification of the regulation is by definition a unilateral act.\n\n26.\n\nThe truth is that the same text appearing in a contract and in a public regulation may engender completely different expectations. In other words, the formal aspects of the instrument containing the text plays a critical role in our understanding of the meaning and significance of that text and, most importantly, our expectations about the stability of the undertakings, promises or commitments in that text.\n\n27.\n\nThese differences play out in domestic legal systems by the ubiquitous division between private and public law (the substantive doctrines, the procedures for claims, the remedial responses), the establishment of different courts and tribunals to deal with civil disputes as opposed to administrative disputes, and so on.\n\n28.\n\nThe majority has failed to attach significance to the fact that the text that is said to give rise to a legitimate expectation is contained in a public regulation. There would apparently be no difference if the text were contained in a contract with the Spanish Government. Indeed, the majority has appropriated the basic features of an action for breach of contract and applied to it a breach of an undertaking in a public regulation under the guise of legitimate expectations. That turns the private/public division on its head and suppresses the basic expectations that distinct institutions of law engender in every legal system. A contractual promise to pay a certain subsidy is absolutely not the same thing as an undertaking in a general public regulation to pay a certain subsidy. When a government decides to memorialise an undertaking in a private law contract it is relinquishing its powers as a public regulator and is putting itself on an equal footing with its private counterparty.16 That undertaking cannot then be unilaterally modified by the government (*pacta sunt servanda*) and only the exceptional doctrines of contract law that render an undertaking inoperable due to a fundamental change of circumstances (*clausula rebus sic stantibus*) will provide a defence to a breach of that undertaking.\n\nI leave to one side the hybrid institution of administrative contracts.\n\n29.\n\nIn contrast, the same undertaking in a public regulation can in principle be modified or revoked at any time by the government. Someone impacted by that modification or revocation is not without any remedy: public or administrative law ensures that the procedure leading to that decision is fair and the substantive outcome is reasonable by reference to a test of proportionality or rationality. But no national or regional legal system contemplates that a government should be strictly liable for modifying or revoking an undertaking in a public regulation as if it were an undertaking in a private law contract.\n\n30.\n\nFor these reasons, it is erroneous to conflate legitimate expectations that may arise from a public regulation and a private law contract. They are distinct institutions of law and they engender very different expectations. It is impermissible to \"privatise\" public regulatory relationships by pretending that they are no different to private contractual relationships. The majority's approach to the contrary is misguided. It will be recalled that they equated the question of a breach of undertaking in a public regulation and a contract with the following observation:\n\nThere is nothing particularly arcane about this question: it is essentially the mirror image of the question whether a State can, *consistently with the FET provision in ECT Article 10*, bind itself to perform a contract, in a manner that cannot be undone by the State enacting legislation that purports to abrogate its contractual obligations.17\n\nDecision, \u00a7199.\n\n31.\n\nWhere a State binds itself to perform a contract, and then uses its sovereign power to abrogate its contractual obligations, it has committed an actionable wrong that has an ancient pedigree in international law. The essence of the wrong is that the State has generated expectations based upon a private contractual relationship, only to then step outside the boundaries of contract law and invoke its sovereign power to undermine that relationship. The State's fault in this situation is manifest. Far from being a \"*mirror image*\", the scenario in the present case is entirely different: the Spanish Government has chosen at the outset to regulate a particular matter on the basis of a general public regulation and there has been no deviation from that position. That must have significance for the expectations that can legitimately arise for those parties who have relied upon the regulation in some way. They cannot have ever legitimately assumed that they would be treated as if they had entered into a binding contract with the Spanish Government.\n\n32.\n\nNo Spanish lawyer would have advised the Claimants that RD 661/2007\u2014a general public regulation enacted by the Spanish Government pursuant to the authority delegated by the Spanish Parliament under the Law on Electricity\u2014gave them the equivalent of a contractual right to a particular subsidy. No Spanish lawyer would have advised the Claimants that RD 661/2007 was immutable or that it implicitly indemnified the Claimants against lost profits associated with a reduction of the subsidy if it were to change. There is no contemporaneous opinion from any Spanish lawyer in support of these propositions because, as a matter of Spanish law, they are plainly absurd.\n\n33.\n\nThe important question for now is whether there is some justification for international investment law to disregard the public/private law distinction and impose strict liability for a change to a public regulation and award compensation based upon a contractual model of damages. As previously stated, the only bridge between the FET standard and a concept of legitimate expectations is that the latter is a general principle of law. It is, therefore, important to investigate how that general principle works in various legal systems.\n\n**B4** **Legitimate expectations in comparative law**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIt is useful to start with the position of EU law because the EU courts were in the same position as investment tribunals in the sense that a set of principles had to be developed from scratch to determine when public authorities (the EU institutions) should be liable in damages to private parties for changes to regulations. They did so by drawing inspiration from the comparative law of the Member States (and from German public law in particular).18 It is also an appropriate starting point because the two States implicated in this case (Spain as the Respondent and Germany as the home State of the investors) are both EU Member States.\n\nP Craig, *UK, EU and Global Administrative Law: Foundations and Challenges (The Hamlyn Lectures)* (CUP, 2016) p. 342. A detailed account of how the related concept of proportionality was developed by the German courts and then migrated to European law (both the European Court of Human Rights and the EU courts) and then to many other legal systems of the world is provided in A Barak, *Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and Their Limitation* (CUP, 2012) pp. 178-210. See also: J Usher, 'The Influence of National Concepts on Decisions of the European Court' (1976) 1 *European Law Review* 359.\n\n35.\n\nThe EU courts have developed a three-stage test for determining when an EU institution should be liable in damages for a breach of legitimate expectations.\n\n36.\n\n**First**, the claimant has to establish a legitimate expectation by reference to a course of conduct or assurance to the effect that the regulation would not change. If the claimant can establish a legitimate expectation in this manner, then the *prima facie* label is attached to it because there is then a **second** stage, which is the balancing exercise to determine whether an overriding public interest should trump the legitimate expectation. The test applied at this second stage is described by some commentators as the \"*significant imbalance test*\",19 and by others as a test of proportionality.20 If the claimant prevails at this stage, then an administrative-type remedy would be available, which is typically the annulment of the offending regulatory provision or decision. In order to get to an award of damages, the claimant must overcome a **third** hurdle, which is that the breach of legitimate expectations is sufficiently serious to justify damages liability.\n\nS Schonberg, *Legitimate Expectations in Administrative Law* (OUP, 2000) 150.\n\nP Craig, *EU Administrative Law* (OUP, 2018, 3rd edn) 638.\n\n37.\n\nThe principles are best illustrated by the \"milk\" cases before the Court of Justice, as they demonstrate the difference in outcomes depending upon illustrative changes to the factual matrix. In an effort to deal with the problems of surplus milk production, which drove down prices to a level that made it unsustainable for farmers, the EU Council introduced a scheme by Regulation no 1078/77 of 17 May 1977, which, in essence, paid farmers not to produce milk for a certain period of time. Mr Mulder was one such farmer who joined the scheme by agreeing with the relevant authority not to deliver milk or dairy products for a period of five years from 1979 to 1984. Just before the expiry of that period, and having made some investments in anticipation of returning to milk production, Mr Mulder applied for a \"reference quantity\" under the Council's new Regulation no 857/84 of 31 March 1984 (this required that an additional levy be paid on quantities of milk delivered in excess of a \"reference quantity\" as a further measure to limit excess milk production). That application was rejected on the basis that the \"reference quantity\" was to be calculated by reference to the farmer's milk production in 1983 and, given that Mr Mulder had agreed not to produce milk at that time under the scheme, he was not entitled to be allocated a \"reference quantity\".\n\n38.\n\nThe Court accepted that Mr Mulder could not expect to resume production under the same conditions as those that applied at the time he voluntarily entered the scheme because it was to be expected that the regulatory regime might evolve over the period in question. This principle was expressed by the Court in a subsequent case in the following terms:\n\n[W]hilst the protection of legitimate expectations is one of the fundamental principles of the community, economic operators cannot have a legitimate expectation that an existing situation which is capable of being altered by the community institutions in the exercise of their discretion will be maintained; this is particularly true in an area such as the common organisation of the markets, the object of which entails constant adjustments to make changes in the economic situation. It follows that economic operators cannot claim a vested right to the maintenance of an advantage which they derive from the establishment of the common organisation of the markets and which they enjoyed at a given time.21\n\nCase C-402/98 *ATB v Ministero per le Politiche Agricole* [2000] ECR I-5501.\n\n39.\n\nNonetheless, the Court found that the new Regulation no 856/84 effectively prevented a farmer who had signed up to the scheme from resuming milk production and that there was nothing in the original Regulation no 1078/77 to suggest that that would be the case. According to the Court: \"*Such an effect therefore frustrates those producers' legitimate expectation that the effects of the system to which they had rendered themselves subject would be limited.*\" Regulation no 856/84 was deemed to be invalid.22 In a case involving another farmer, Mr Spagl, the Court then declared that the subsequent amendment to Regulation no 856/84 was also invalid: in response to the Court's decision in respect of Mr Mulder, the Council had attempted to fix the \"reference quantity\" to 60% of the quantity of milk delivered or sold by the farmer prior to entering the scheme. That was also deemed to be a breach of Mr Spagl's legitimate expectations because the \"discount\" was far higher than for producers who had not entered the scheme and the public interest justification for the differential reduction was not necessary to achieve the overall purposes of Regulation no 856/84.23\n\nCase 120/86 *Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij* [1988] ECR 2321.\n\nCase C-189/89 *Spagl v Hauptzollamt Rosenheim* [1990] ECR I-4539.\n\n40.\n\nIn these two cases, the Court awarded a public law-type remedy for the violation of a legitimate expectation as a public law doctrine: it declared the offending provisions of the Regulation to be invalid. But EU law recognises, like many other legal systems, that a public law ground for challenging an administrative decision does not *ipso facto* supply the basis for compensatory damages. This is almost invariably overlooked by tribunals in the investment treaty context, even if they profess fidelity to the fault-based concept of legitimate expectations in public law by applying the \"balancing test\" at the second stage.\n\n41.\n\nThe EU courts have constructed a bridge between a wrong in public law (legitimate expectations) and the remedy of compensatory damages by introducing a higher threshold for entitlement to the latter. The test developed by the ECJ is whether there has been a \"*significantly flagrant violation of a superior rule of law for the protection of the individual*\".24 A superior rule of law for the protection of the individual includes legitimate expectations. But a further element is required to shift losses from the EU to individuals and that is the additional threshold of a \"*significantly flagrant violation*\".\n\nCase 5/71 *Aktien-Zuckerfabrik Sch\u00f6ppenstedt v Council* [1971] ECR 975.\n\n42.\n\nMr Mulder and Mr Spagl subsequently pursued an action for damages based upon these principles. The first succeeded, whereas the second failed. Mr Muller succeeded because the original Regulation no 856/84 completely failed to take into account farmers in the situation of Mr Mulder without invoking any higher public interest: \"*the Community legislature manifestly and gravely disregard of the limits of its discretionary power, thereby committing a sufficiently serious breach of a superior rule of law.*\"25\n\nCases C-104/89 and 37/90 *Mulder and Heinemann v Council and Commission* [1992] ECR I-306, [19].\n\n43.\n\nMr Spagl failed because, unlike the original Regulation no 856/84, the amended Regulation that introduced the 60% rule did not make it impossible for farmers who had entered the scheme to resume milk production and the Council had also explained the public interest reasons behind the compromise in the amendment. The Council, therefore, \"*took account of a higher public interest, without gravely and manifestly disregarding the limits of its discretionary power in this area*\".26\n\nCase C-189/89 *Spagl v Hauptzollamt Rosenheim* [1990] ECR I-4539, [21].\n\n44.\n\nThis is not the place to provide a comprehensive account of the doctrine of legitimate expectations in comparative law. The position under EU law is likely to be broadly reflective of how the doctrine works in the legal systems of most of the Member States. It is also considered to be more favourable to individuals than public authorities in comparison with French and English law at least.27 It will suffice to note that no legal system, according to my research, applies a doctrine of legitimate expectations on the basis of strict liability. In each legal system, the inquiry begins by asking whether a legitimate expectation can be established, and, if it can, the court must determine whether an appropriate balance has been struck between the public interest grounds for changing a policy and the frustration of a legitimate expectation based on that policy.\n\nS Schonberg, *Legitimate Expectations in Administrative Law* (OUP, 2000) 142-146, 150-1, 222-224.\n\n45.\n\nThe English High Court in *Solar Century Holdings*, a case involving a challenge to the earlier-than-promised repeal of a subsidy programme for renewable energy, described this balancing exercise as follows:\n\nAnd even if a sufficiently certain promise or representation has been made that a policy will continue in force and not be changed until a fixed date there is always a balance still to be struck between the retention of that policy and the strength of the (*ex hypothesi*) rational grounds which have arisen and which now are said by the Government to necessitate a frustration of that prior representation or promise. The test laid down by the Courts is whether the change of policy and the concomitant thwarting of the prior expectation amount to an abuse of power.\n\n(Emphasis in the original.)28\n\n*Solar Century Holdings Limited v Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change* [2014] EWHC 3677 (Admin), [73] per Justice Green.\n\n46.\n\nThe invocation of \"*abuse of power*\" in this test makes liability conditional upon fault. In other legal systems a test of \"*significant imbalance*\" or \"*proportionality*\" is preferred. But the common denominator is that there is always an element of fault in the second stage of the analysis when the doctrine of legitimate expectations is applied.\n\n**B5** **The different approaches to legitimate expectations in the Spanish solar cases**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nA total of 24 decisions on liability in the Spanish solar cases have been made available to the Tribunal in this case. There is a clear division in this jurisprudence between tribunals or majorities that have adopted a strict liability approach in interpreting the concept of legitimate expectations under the FET standard and those that have found or rejected liability based on fault. The touchstone of fault that is generally adopted is proportionality, which is assessed primarily in terms of whether the investment continued to earn a reasonable rate of return after the regime of RD 661/2007 was abolished. The division between the two strands in the jurisprudence is rather neat: there are 12 decisions favouring strict liability as against 12 decisions adopting a fault-based approach.\n\n48.\n\nIn the lists of cases that follow, an asterisk designates a dissent on the critical issue under discussion.\n\n49.\n\n**First**, the following are the 12 decisions of a tribunal or majority in favour of the strict liability approach that had been adopted by the majority in the present case. I have been careful to include in this list decisions that refer to \"proportionality\" or a \"balancing exercise\" but that in reality uphold liability simply on the basis of a significant change to the regulatory regime that causes loss and thus reflect a strict liability approach.\n\n49.1. **[1]** *9REN Holding S.a.r.l v.

But what is more disquieting is the almost complete lack of engagement with the arguments in favour of the fault-based conception of legitimate expectations in the decisions that support the alternative strict liability approach. Moreover, outside of the Spanish solar context, the fault-based approach appears to be predominant in the solar cases involving the Czech Republic29 and Italy.30\n\nEg: *Antaris GMBH et al v. Czech Republic* (PCA Case No. 2014-01, Award, 2 May 2018, \u00a7360).\n\nEg: *Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v.

Italy* (Award, 16 January 2019, \u00a7\u00a7236-243).\n\n53.\n\nThis tendency is further disquieting because the early investment cases on legitimate expectations as an element of the FET standard clearly envisaged a fault-based conception of liability.31 So did the academic commentary on those cases.32 The shift to strict liability is thus a break with the early trend in the investment jurisprudence and a departure from the general principles of law recognized by the major legal systems (which as a source of international law supplies the only rational link to incorporation of the concept into the FET standard by interpretation). And all this has happened in a void of justificatory reasoning.\n\nEg: *Saluka v Czech Republic* (Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00a7306); *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v United Mexican States* (NAFTA, Separate Opinion of Prof. W\u00e4lde, 1 December 2005, \u00a7\u00a72, 27, 30, 48).\n\nEg: E. Snodgrass, 'Protecting Investors' Legitimate Expectations: Recognizing and Delimiting a General Principle' (2006) 21 *ICSID Review* 1, 45 et seq. A recent 'retrospective' on this issue is provided in F. Ortino, 'The Public Interest as Part of Legitimate Expectations in Investment Arbitration: Missing in Action?' in C. Brower, J. Donoghue, C. Murphy, C. Payne & E. Shirlow (eds). *By Peaceful Means. International Adjudication and Arbitration: Essays in Honour of David D. Caron* (2022).\n\n**B6** **Conclusion on the strict liability approach favoured by the majority**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nI conclude this section by taking issue with the central tenet of the majority's reasoning, which is replicated in many of the decisions favouring a strict liability approach to legitimate expectations. That is the notion that a foreign investor has a vested right to the maintenance of a particular regulatory regime under the FET standard. Following this approach, liability is imposed simply on the basis of a change to the \"*fundamentals*\" of the regime in place when the investment was made. It matters not that the change was otherwise unimpeachable as being in the public interest and not discriminatory or arbitrary or imposing a disproportionate burden on the investor. This is an extraordinary proposition with far-reaching consequences.\n\n55.\n\n**First**, it fails to calibrate liability by reference to the impact of any changes to the regulatory regime to the economic position of the particular investor in question. Liability is instead established in the abstract: if there is a radical change to a regulatory regime upon which an investor has relied, then there is a breach. But investors cannot have a legal interest in the design of a regulatory regime; their only concern is how it affects their bottom line. If RD 661/2007 were replaced by a radically different regime that increased the subsidy to the Claimants, they would have no complaint before this Tribunal. If RD 661/2007 were replaced by a radically different regime that decreased the subsidy to the Claimants but increased it for others, the majority's approach would result in a declaration that the introduction of the new regime is internationally wrongful in the abstract, and, logically, in respect of everyone.\n\n56.\n\n**Second**, if a radical change to a regulatory regime is sufficient to trigger liability, then the ramifications for countries experiencing political upheavals are rather serious. Take the United Kingdom. Countless foreign investors relied upon regulatory regimes developed and enacted by the EU authorities and incorporated into British law when they invested. The United Kingdom had also given the most robust assurance possible under the British Constitution that it would apply those regimes in perpetuity by enacting the European Communities Act 1972. The advent of Brexit was far less foreseeable than the repeal of RD 661/2007. Are all those foreign investors in the United Kingdom entitled to compensation for breach of their legitimate expectation to stability if the European regulatory regimes are replaced by (sufficiently different) British ones? Would similar considerations apply for countries transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy with the large-scale reforms that entails?\n\n57.\n\n**Third**, in an era where radical reforms in the energy sector are not only desirable but necessary for the sustainability of human life on Earth, it seems incongruous now to be interpreting the FET standard as requiring States to buy back their right to implement those reforms at the highest price. In this case the investment is in renewable energy. But if the strict liability approach is generalised (and there is no principled basis for limiting it to cases involving renewable energy), then the public interest considerations behind any reform are by definition irrelevant to the determination of liability in damages. The regulatory chill that inevitably accompanies this approach will be no consolation to a warming planet.\n\n**C****WAS THERE A LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION IN THIS CASE?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**C1** **The interpretation of Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May, Regulating the Activity of Electricity Production under the Special Regime (*****RD 661/2007*****)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRD 661/2007 allocated a subsidy to the Claimants' PV projects. The majority considers that \"*RD 661/2007 contained express assurances that its fixed tariffs would apply to qualifying, registered PV facilities for a fixed period, and that changes to the regulatory regime would not apply to facilities already registered.*\"33 The majority does not, however, identify the precise language in RD 661/2007, or in any other text, that is said to lead to that conclusion. The Claimants, for their part, rely on Article 44(3), and in particular the underlined text set out below:34\n\n3. During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010, and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.\n\nThe revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.35\n\nDecision, \u00a7190.\n\nC's Memorial, \u00a7179.\n\nC-98 (improved), PDF pp. 49-50 (emphasis added).\n\n59.\n\nThe underlined paragraph undoubtedly says that the adjustment mechanism in Article 44(3) (\"*this paragraph*\") would not be used to change the level of subsidy set out in RD 661/2007 for projects that had a deed of commissioning before the relevant date (this included the Claimants' PV projects). The question is then whether it was reasonable to interpret this language as preventing the amendment or wholesale repeal of RD 661/2007 if the fundamental assumptions underlying RD 661/2007 were to change.\n\n60.\n\nThis basic distinction between \"micro\" stability within the framework of applying particular regulation and \"macro\" stability requiring that regulation to remain in force at all costs and regardless of the circumstances is not lost on anyone familiar with legitimate expectations in public law. In the words of the English High Court in the *Solar Century Holdings* case:\n\nWhen what is objected to is the abrogation of a policy or a change of policy the starting point is that once a policy is promulgated and said to be settled there needs to be a rational ground for terminating it\u2026 But there is no presumption that policy cannot change; on the contrary it plainly can do so and frequently does. So the issue becomes whether there can be identified a representation of sufficient certitude that the policy will not be changed regardless of surrounding circumstances. As to this a representation that a policy will continue until a specified date is not the same as a promise that it will never be changed even if circumstances change. If it were otherwise then an intention to pursue a policy for a fixed period would become set in stone and permanently unyielding to changes in relevant circumstances however compelling they might be.36\n\n*Solar Century Holdings Limited v Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change* [2014) EWHC 3677 (Admin), [72] per Justice Green.\n\n61.\n\n(The English court then, in the passage quoted previously, stated that even where a promise of \"macro\" stability had been made in this sense, \"*there is always a balance still to be struck between the retention of that policy and the strength of the (ex hypothesi) rational grounds which have arisen and which now are said by the Government to necessitate a frustration of that prior representation or promise*\". This is the fault-element for liability for breach of a legitimate expectation that I have already examined in this dissent.)\n\n62.\n\nI repeat an earlier point: the language in Article 44(3) RD 661/2007 is language found in a public law regulation and not a private law contract. When such language is found in a public regulation, the relevant context is that a government has the power in public law to repeal that regulation if the circumstances change and the public interest requires it. One cannot read the underlined text as if it appeared in a private law contract where no such power exists. This is precisely what the Claimants ask us to do. They say this: \"*Absent an express provision [in RD 661/2007] allowing Spain to modify the economic regime as it applied to existing plants, it had no right to do so.*\"37 That is manifestly the wrong starting point for interpreting a public regulation. (And it would mean the British Government would have much to lose by failing to include a clause such as \"*this regulation is subject to amendment or repeal should the UK leave the EU*\" in every regulation it enacted between 1973 and 2020.)\n\nC's Reply, \u00a7234.\n\n63.\n\nDoes the language of Article 44(3) really say that the Spanish Government agrees to absolve itself of the power to repeal that regulation if the circumstances change and the public interest requires it? That it agreed to stability in the \"macro\" sense? There is certainly nothing in the text itself to suggest that. And even a rudimentary understanding of the Spanish legal order and the legislative history flatly contradicts such a proposition.\n\n64.\n\nRD 661/2007 was enacted in furtherance of Law 54/1997 of 27 November 1997 on the Electricity Sector (***Law 54/1997***). Law 54/1997 is the umbrella legislation for RD 661/2007. A Royal Decree Regulation is subordinate to a Law and a Royal Decree Law, which, in turn, are subordinate to the Spanish Constitution. A Royal Decree Regulation (referred to simply as \"Royal Decrees\") cannot contradict Laws or Royal Decree Laws.38 In Spanish legal practice, a Law enacted by the Spanish Parliament contains the general principles regulating the subject matter in question, whereas the detailed provisions giving effect to those general principles are set out in subsequent Royal Decrees promulgated by the Government. In the present case, RD 661/2007 was enacted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\n\nR-35, Organic Law 6/1985, of 1 July, on the Judiciary, Article 6 (\"The Judges and the Courts shall not apply regulations or any other provision contrary to the Constitution, the law or the principle of normative hierarchy.\").\n\n65.\n\nChapter II of Law 54/1997 creates the \"*Special regime for electricity production*\" that applies, *inter alia*, to solar electricity production. Article 30 of Chapter II is entitled \"*Obligations and rights applicable to energy producers operating under the special regime*\" and contains the following provisions relating to the remuneration of energy producers:\n\n3. The remunerative regime applicable to electrical energy production plants operating under the special regime shall be adjusted pursuant to provisions outlined in sub-section 1 of article 16 for electrical energy purposes.\n\n4. The payment regime applicable for electricity production facilities under the special regime shall be supplemented by the earning of a premium, under the terms set by regulations, in the following cases:\n\na) Facilities referred to in letter a) of section 1 of article 27 [which includes solar plants such as those operated by the Claimants]\n\n[\u2026]\n\nTo determine the premium, the voltage level of electricity delivered to the network must be considered, along with the actual contribution to improvement of the environment, primary energy savings and energy efficiency, the economically justifiable production of usable heat, and the investment costs that have been incurred, for the purpose of achieving reasonable rates of return with respect to the cost of money in the capital market.39\n\nC-31, Article 30.\n\n66.\n\nThe underlined passages in Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 are important. **First**, it is envisaged that the premium to which energy producers are entitled will be established under the terms set by regulations (i.e. Royal Decrees). Hence Law 54/1997 does not itself establish the terms of the premium: consistently with Spanish legislative practice the precise terms of the premium are to be fixed in subordinate legislation in the form of Royal Decrees. **Second**, the overriding principle for the determination of the premium is to achieve \"*reasonable rates of return*\" by taking into account, *inter alia*, the investment costs that have been incurred and the cost of money in the capital market. Any Royal Decree giving effect to this provision would have to calculate the premium consistently with this overriding principle.\n\n67.\n\nRD 661/2007 expressly recognises these core principles of Law 54/1997 in its preamble:\n\nThe economic framework in the present Royal Decree develops the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime a reasonable return on their investments, and the consumers of electricity an assignment of the costs attributable to the electricity system which is also reasonable.40\n\nC-98 (improved), PDF p. 4.\n\n68.\n\nGiven that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 must be read consistently with Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997\u2014in case of inconsistency Article 44(3) would be invalid\u2014 and given that the preamble to RD 661/2007 expressly refers to the same fundamental regulatory objectives as in Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997, is it legitimate to assume that the fixed tariff or premium rates in RD 661/2007 would never be modified by a subsequent regulation even if owners of facilities were earning a manifestly unreasonable rate of return and consumers were bearing unreasonable costs? The stability provided for in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 would no doubt exist so long as the fundamental assumptions underlying RD 661/2007 pertained. But if those assumptions were no longer tenable, can Article 44(3) really be read as a guarantee that RD 661/2007 would never be revised or repealed?\n\n69.\n\nThe prior legislative history categorically refutes this proposition of immutability. RD 661/2007 was preceded by RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004 and RD Law 7/2006. This demonstrates that the terms of the premium envisaged in Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 would be fixed by regulations as promulgated from time to time. Moreover, the preamble of RD 661/2007 specifically justified the repeal of the then in force RD 436/2004 on the basis that the fundamental economic and technical assumptions had changed:\n\nThe modification of the economic and legal framework which regulates the special regime existing to date has become necessary for various reasons. First of all, the growth seen in the special regime over recent years tied to the experience accumulated during the application of Royal Decree 2818/1998, of 23 December and Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, has shown the need to regulate certain technical aspects in order to contribute to the growth of those technologies, while maintaining the security of the electrical system and ensuring the quality of supply, and minimising the restrictions on the production of electricity generated in this manner. In view of the behaviour of the prices in the market, where certain variables which were not considered in the cited compensation system for the special regime have, over recent times, acquired greater importance, the economic circumstances established by Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, make it necessary to modify the compensation system and de-link it from the Mean Electricity Tariff, or Reference Tariff, which has been used to date. Finally, it is necessary to include the changes in the legislation deriving from European law, and from Royal Decree-Law 7/2006, of 23 June, Adopting urgent measures in the energy sector, Introducing major amendments in respect of the law applicable to the combined heat and power business.41\n\nC-98 (improved), PDF pp. 3-4.\n\n70.\n\nThis is deeply significant because the repealed RD 436/2004 contained almost precisely the same language that the Claimants say introduced a stabilised regime in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007. Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 reads:\n\n3. The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants that commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred to in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any previous tariffs and premiums.42\n\nC-75, PDF p. 40.\n\n71.\n\nAnd yet, Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 could not have produced the stabilisation upheld by the majority because it was repealed and replaced by RD 661/2007. The Claimants were aware of this when they invested. The Claimants simply observe that \"*Crucially, RD 661/2007 retained and clarified RD 436/2004's guarantee against non-retroactivity.*\"43 But if the Claimants and the majority are correct, RD 661/2007 did far more than \"*retain and clarify*\", it introduced a radically different regime that, for the first time, was stabilised. According to the majority:\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that RD 661/2007 set out assurances on which it was intended that potential investors could and would rely, concerning the stability of the compensation framework established by RD 661/2007.44\n\nC's Memorial, \u00a7179.\n\nDecision, \u00a7195.\n\n72.\n\nBut the problem for this theory of immutability is that the previous RD 436/2004 contained almost exactly the same \"*assurances*\" and yet it was repealed and replaced by RD 661/2007 before the Claimants invested. Not only that, the Supreme Court had expressly ruled that the language in Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 could not give rise to a legitimate expectation that the regulated tariff and premium would be immutable (more about that later). And the Claimants themselves accept that there could be no legitimate expectation based on the continuation of RD 436/2004:\n\nClaimants do not argue that investors under RD 436/2004 had legitimate expectations that they would benefit from a defect in the law that would cause the tariffs to increase after investments were completed in unexpected and artificial ways.45\n\nC's Reply, \u00a7246.\n\n73.\n\nNeither the Claimants, nor the majority, explain their position that RD 661/2007 established a radically different form of stabilisation as compared with RD 436/2004, in circumstances where the text is virtually identical. This is certainly not how the industry organisations and leading commentors on the solar energy market viewed the changes. The Association of Renewable Energy Generators (the \"APPA\") attacked the Spanish Government for repealing RD 436/2004 precisely because of the stabilisation language in Article 40(3), calling it a violation of the legitimate expectations of existing investors in circumstances where there was no \"*urgent or unavoidable matter of public interest*\".46 The APPA said that the draft of RD 661/2007 if implemented \"*is disastrous and devastating for future investments*\".47\n\nR-0287, PDF p. 5.\n\nR-0287, PDF p. 7.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants quote the following extract from the authoritative *Powering the Green Economy: The Feed-In Tariff Handbook* in their Reply,48 which also flatly contradicts the idea of a radical change in stabilisation between RD 436/2004 and RD 661/2007:\n\nUp until 2004, the tariff level could change every year, thus making the financing of renewable electricity projects largely unpredictable (Jacobs, 2008).\n\nThe legislative breakthrough came in 2004, with the Royal Decree 436/2004 and the amendment in 2007 (BOE, 2007). By 2003, the Spanish regulator CNE had already established a transparent methodology for calculating tariffs based on their average generation costs (see Section 2.3). From 2004 on, tariff payment was guaranteed for at least 15 years, in the case of some technologies even for the whole lifetime of a power plant. \u2026 In 2007 [through RD 661/2007], the tariff payment was eventually disconnected from the average electricity price and based on a fixed tariff payment per kilowatthour.49\n\nC's Reply, \u00a7295.\n\nRL-088, PDF p. 118 (emphasis added).\n\n75.\n\nIf RD 661/2007 had really ushered in a radically new stabilised regime, then one would expect to read about it in the preamble that explains at length the objectives of the new regulation. But the opposite is true: the preamble emphasizes continuity with the repealed RD 436/2004:\n\nThe present Royal Decree replaces and repeals Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, establishing the methodology for updating and systematisation of the legal and economic framework of the activity of the production of electrical energy under the special regime, while maintaining the basic structure of the regulations therein.\n\nThe economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime a reasonable return on their investments, and the consumers of electricity an assignment of the costs attributable to the electricity system which is also reasonable [\u2026]\n\nTo this effect, a system which is analogous to that provided in Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, is maintained, in which the owner of the facility may opt to sell their energy at a regulated tariff, which will be the same for all scheduling periods, or alternatively to sell this energy directly on the daily market, the term market, or through a bilateral contract, in this case receiving the price negotiated in the market plus a premium.50\n\nC-98 (improved), PDF p. 4 (emphasis added).\n\n76.\n\nIndeed, there is no reference whatsoever to the \"stabilisation\" language relied upon by the Claimants in Article 44(3) in the dense five-page preamble of RD 661/2007 or to any heightened or superior stabilisation as compared with the previous RD 436/2004.\n\n77.\n\nAlso critical is the fact that the Spanish Supreme Court specifically rejected the argument that RD 436/2004 created a stabilised regime immune to revision in its Judgment of 25 October 2006. In that case, the appellants contended that RD 2351/2004, which changed the system for calculating the premiums under RD 436/2004 violated the principles of legal certainty, legitimate expectations and good faith contrary to Article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution. After noting that the amendments did not violate Article 30 of Law 54/1997 (the appellants had not submitted otherwise), the Supreme Court dismissed this argument based on legitimate expectations with the following reasons:\n\nThe same consideration applies to the principle of legitimate expectations, increasingly but unduly deployed as an argument against quite a few regulatory changes that some economic operators have deemed more or less harmful to their interests. The appellants argue that their investments in the production of electrical energy under the special regime were made at a particular time \"when they trusted the Government not to change the legal conditions that decided them to (\u2026) build their facility\". This premise leads them to conclude that the reduction of premiums subsequent to Royal Decree 2351/2004 with respect to those in Royal Decree 435/2004 is contrary to the principle.\n\nWe cannot agree that this reasoning can be applied to an incentive mechanism such as the premiums in question. Until it is replaced by another, the above outlined legal regulation (Article 30 of the Electricity Law) allows the respective companies to expect that the fixing of the premiums can be included as a factor relevant to their obtaining \"reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market\" or, to put it again in the words of the preamble to Royal Decree 436/2004, \"reasonable compensation for their investments.\" However the payment regime under examination does not guarantee to special regime electricity producers that a certain level of profits or revenues will be unchanged relative to those obtained in previous years, or that the formulas for fixing the premiums will stay unchanged.\n\nJust as in terms of an economic policy with many different aspects (the promotion of renewable energy but also the planning of electricity networks, and other considerations regarding energy saving and efficiency) grants and incentives for the production of electricity under the special regime may increase from one year to another, but they may also decrease when those same considerations warrant it. We stress that these changes have remained within the legal limits that regulate this type of promotion, and the mere fact that the annual adjustment or the level of the premium goes up or down does not of itself constitute grounds for revocation or affect the legitimate expectations of their recipients.\n\nCompanies that freely decide to enter a market such as electricity generation under the special regime, knowing that is largely dependent on the setting of economic incentives by public authorities, are or should be aware that they may be modified within legal guidelines, by those same authorities. One of the \"regulatory risks\" to which they submit and which they must take into account, is precisely the variation of parameters for premiums or incentives, something which the Electricity Sector law limited\u2026 but does not preclude.51\n\nR-0133 PDF p.4, Judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court, 25 October 2006 (emphasis added).\n\n78.\n\nThis Judgment was a matter of public record at the time that the Claimants invested in Spain. The subsequent judgments of the Supreme Court applied the same principles.52\n\nEg: R-0137, Judgment of the Supreme Court, 9 December 2009; R-0248, Judgment of the Supreme Court, 1 June 2016.\n\n79.\n\nAn investor seeking to make an investment in the renewable energy sector in Spain on the basis of RD 661/2007 would thus have been on notice that:\n\n79.1. The umbrella legislation, Law 54/1997, required the premium to be calculated in order to generate a reasonable rate of return;\n\n79.2. Law 54/1997 also envisaged that the terms of the premium would be established by regulations;\n\n79.3. Several regulations preceded RD 661/2007 and their promulgation, amendment and/or and repeal was justified by the Ministry of Trade and Energy as necessary to give effect to changing market conditions for the calculation of the premium;\n\n79.4. RD 436/2004 contained virtually identical \"stabilisation\" language as RD 661/2007 and yet RD 436/2004 was repealed precisely because there were distortions in the calculation of the tariff for the special regime that needed to be addressed;\n\n79.5. The Supreme Court had specifically rejected an argument to the effect that a provision in the earlier RD 436/2004 that purported to disapply the modifications to the calculation of the premium introduced by that Royal Decree to existing installations resulted in the immutability of RD 436/2004. The Supreme Court held that the disapplication only had effect so long as RD 436/2004 itself was not amended or repealed;\n\n79.6. In the preamble to RD 661/2007, the Ministry of Trade and Energy justified the promulgation of the Royal Decree as necessary in order to take into account changing market conditions and to preserve the principle of a reasonable rate of return set out in Law 54/1997.\n\n80.\n\nMy conclusion is that the Claimants had no legitimate expectation that RD 661/2007, and the tariffs that it fixed for the special regime, would continue in force regardless of whether there were significant changes to the underlying economic assumptions behind that regulation. That does not mean that Article 44(3) had no stabilizing effect and was deprived of any utility (as the Claimants maintain), nor does it mean that the Spanish Government was free to adjust the tariffs whenever it wished to bring them in line with a \"*reasonable rate of return*\" (as the Respondent maintains). These two extremes of complete stability versus no stability present a false dichotomy. I will address this further below.\n\n**C2** **The general context of RD 661/2007: the allocation of a state subsidy**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe conclusions relating to the interpretation of the text and legislative history of RD 661/2007 provided in the foregoing section are reinforced if the context of what was being regulated is added to the picture. What was being regulated was a state subsidy.\n\n82.\n\nWhen the Claimants invested in the renewable energy sector in Spain in 2007-2008, it was impossible to make a commercial return from the production of solar energy without a state subsidy. This was because fossil fuels were still a much cheaper source of energy. Today, that may no longer be the case. In 2007, however, state intervention was critical to develop what was otherwise an unprofitable sector of the economy and the broad purpose of that intervention was to subsidize the price for renewable energy so it could compete with non-renewable energy sources. An investment in renewable energy was not an investment that made money without the involvement of the State; to the contrary, it was an investment that could only be profitable if the State was involved. Indeed, the level of profit that the investor could expect to earn depended almost exclusively on the level of subsidy that the State was prepared to pay.\n\n83.\n\nA state subsidy to private investors in the solar energy sector is financed by taxpayers and electricity consumers. For a subsidy to be economically rational, the State must ensure that the level of the subsidy is no more and no less than is necessary to make solar energy competitive in the market for energy. More specifically, this means that the subsidy must cover the higher investment and/or operating costs of renewable energy producers as compared with non-renewable energy producers. If the subsidy is inadequate in this sense, then investment into the solar energy sector will not materialise. If the subsidy is too generous, then it will distort competition and trade and place an unjustifiable burden on taxpayers and consumers.\n\n84.\n\nThe gravity of the negative consequences that flow from a subsidy that violates these basic economic principles has inspired regulation at the international and regional level: the most prominent instruments are the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and Articles 107-109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\"). Under Article 107 TFEU, State aid is generally prohibited unless it falls within one of the enumerated exemptions. One of the requirements for lawful state aid is that it is proportionate; in other words, the amount of aid per beneficiary must be limited to the minimum needed to achieve the particular objective for the production of energy.53 If the subsidy is too generous in this sense, then the EU Commission will declare it to be unlawful state aid.\n\nThe European Commission promulgated 'guidelines' for state aid in support of renewable energy sources that makes this point expressly: R-0047, Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2015-2020' (2014/C 200/01). The first such guidelines were issued in 2001: R-0347, Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection (2001/C 82/01).\n\n85.\n\nThis is important context for interpreting whether RD 661/2007 contained a promise of immutability concerning the level of the subsidy regardless of any changes to the market for energy. The concept of a \"*reasonable rate of return*\" encapsulated in Law 54/1997 is not there by accident: if a subsidy is \"unreasonable\" because it goes further than ensuring that a producer of renewable energy can be competitive in the market vis-\u00e0-vis a producer of non-renewable energy, then it constitutes unlawful state aid.\n\n86.\n\nGiven this background, it would be unreasonable to interpret RD 661/2007 as compelling the Spanish Government to maintain the level of subsidy fixed by that regulation even if it were no longer proportionate to the objectives pursued by the subsidy in the first place. It is rather unlikely that the Spanish Government would have committed itself in RD 661/2007 to violate EU and national law on state aid if the circumstances changed. There is certainly nothing in RD 661/2007 to suggest otherwise.\n\n**D****THE EXTENT OF THE STABILITY THAT WAS PROVIDED BY RD 661/2007 AND THE PROPER APPROACH TO THIS CASE**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nI have already stated that the parties in this case have presented a false dichotomy between complete stability and no stability at all under RD 661/2007. These extremes are encapsulated in the following passage of the Claimants' Reply:\n\nSpain's argument would render Article 44, and especially the last sentence of Article 44.3, completely superfluous. If Spain could revise the economic regime at any time for any reason, then it was unnecessary to specify in Article 44 what kind of revisions could occur and when, and then restrict the application of the quadrennial \"policy revisions\" to plants commissioned in the future.54\n\nC's Reply, \u00a7235.\n\n88.\n\nThe majority also opines that without the alleged promise of immutability in RD 661/2007, the Claimants' future income flow would be a matter of \"*pure speculation*\".55\n\nDecision, \u00a7352.\n\n89.\n\nSo long as RD 661/2007 remained in force, Article 44(3) operated to ensure that the Claimants' tariffs under the special regime would only be adjusted in accordance with the mechanism set out in that provision. I reject the Respondent's case to the contrary that the Spanish Government could make other adjustments to bring the tariffs into line with a \"reasonable rate of return\" while the regime in RD 661/2007 applied.\n\n90.\n\nDoes that mean Article 44(3) was devoid of utility, given the Spanish Government always retained the power to repeal RD 661/2007?\n\n91.\n\nOf course not. And the failure of tribunals to recognise the limitations upon the Spanish Government's power in these circumstances has contributed to the false dichotomy that I have alluded to.\n\n92.\n\nIf the Spanish Government were to repeal RD 661/2007, as it ultimately did, then its action would be subject to the constraints on public power contained in Spanish constitutional and administrative law, as well as in the ECT and international law. Under international law, the repeal could not, in respect of protected investments, be arbitrary, discriminatory, expropriatory, or violate due process and so on. If the Spanish Government, for example, were to have repealed RD 661/2007 on the basis that it no longer considered renewable energy worthy of support in rejection of the scientific evidence of global warming, then such repeal might well attract the opprobrium of international law.\n\n93.\n\nThe general constraints on public power in international law provide a certain measure of stability to foreign investments. They do not guarantee complete stability by creating a strict liability regime that compensates for any change.\n\n94.\n\nIn the present case there is no dispute that the Spanish Government's repeal of RD 661/2007 was made on the basis of legitimate public interest grounds and the Claimants' investments continue to make a return. So its actions pass the test of the traditional grounds of review under international law. This case is about whether a concept of legitimate expectations enhances the protected realm of stability further than those traditional grounds.\n\n95.\n\nThe majority says that it does but it is forced into the logic of strict liability to uphold the Claimants' \"all or nothing\" approach. The public interest reasons for the repeal of RD 661/2007, and the extent of the impact of the repeal on the Claimants' investments, are irrelevant to the majority's assessment of liability. It has treated the language of Article 44 RD 661/2007 as if it were contained in a private contract save that the Spanish Government is actually worse off because even in contract law there are exceptions to *pacta sunt servanda* (force majeure, frustration, and so on).\n\n96.\n\nBut that is not the only way to approach this case.\n\n97.\n\nIt may be that the concept of legitimate expectations is not the right vehicle for enhancing the protected realm of stability under the ECT and international law in the circumstances of the Spanish solar cases. Its usefulness is probably confined to cases involving individualised decisions by state authorities rather than general regulations.\n\n98.\n\nThe problem for legitimate expectations in these cases is that one has to accept a proposition that is patently absurd to get over the first hurdle. That proposition is that RD 661/2007 contained an undertaking of immutability when such an undertaking, if given, would have violated Spanish constitutional and administrative law as well as EU state aid law. The Spanish Government cannot, in a Royal Decree, promise not to amend or repeal that decree if the public interest requires it, nor can it bind the Spanish Parliament not to amend or repeal Law 54/1997, which provides the legislative authority for the Spanish Government to have enacted RD 661/2007 in the first place.\n\n99.\n\nSo can an investor have a legitimate expectation that is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the Spanish legal order? Some tribunals have ducked the question by relying on the circular argument that it is the ECT and not Spanish law that applies. But the ECT does not create legitimate expectations; it can only serve to protect them once established. And so the question is whether the ECT should protect an expectation that flatly contradicts the law of the host State. The majority thinks it should:\n\nNo-one questions that Spain had the legal capacity to change the regulatory regime. The question is whether it was fair and equitable to do so in a manner that caused harm to certain investors who had relied on representations that Spain would not exercise that undoubted power in relation to their investments.56\n\nDecision, \u00a7193.\n\n100.\n\nOf course I do not agree that the Spanish Government represented in RD 661/2007 that it would not exercise its power to change the regulatory regime in the future come what may, in violation of its own constitutional and administrative law. But leaving that point to one side, this tension between the plausibility of an expectation of immutability under the law of the host State and the protection of that expectation under international law has never been addressed in a satisfactory way.\n\n101.\n\nIt also generates a rather surreal discussion about whether the investor undertook proper due diligence on this question of local law. The consensus is that such due diligence is necessary to establish that the expectation was legitimate. But that puts the investor in an impossible position: unless it can find a local lawyer who is professionally negligent, no one is realistically going to opine that, as a matter of Spanish law, the Spanish Government gave a valid assurance of immutability in RD 661/2007. Many tribunals have commented upon the absence of such legal opinions in the Spanish solar cases as a point against the claimants. But this is at best a rhetorical observation. In the present case the Claimants have been compelled to say that, despite receiving written due diligence reports on a host of issues relating to their PV projects, the legal opinion on the immutability of RD 661/2007 was given orally by a Spanish lawyer.57 Alas there is no documentary record for it. Unlike the majority,58 I cannot give any weight to this. The fundamental point, however, is that the quest to produce such an opinion was a fool's errand to begin with.\n\n2nd WS Kruck, \u00a7\u00a73-6.\n\nDecision, \u00a7191.\n\n102.\n\nThe path to a more coherent analysis of liability in these cases is to abandon the \"all-or-nothing\" approach to stability that is premised on an artificially reconstructed promise of immutability on the part of the host State and the investor's concomitant expectation of the same. The concept of proportionality, rather than legitimate expectations, might be the better vehicle.\n\n103.\n\nProportionality as a ground for administrative review is likely to have a better claim to being a general principle of law recognized by the major legal systems of the world than legitimate expectations. It has also been adopted by the EU courts. The question of whether there was a promise of immutability that might generate a legitimate expectation is avoided altogether. Instead, in accordance with the most developed conception of proportionality in German law, a three-stage test applies: (i) whether the disputed measure was suitable for the attainment of the desired objective; (ii) whether the disputed measure was necessary, in the sense that the state authority had no other option that was less restrictive of the individual's interests; and (iii) whether the measure was disproportionate to the restrictions thereby applied.59\n\nJ Schwarze, *European Administrative Law* (Sweet & Maxwell, 2006) 685-7.\n\n104.\n\nAt first blush, this appears to be a very invasive test (and indeed, the English courts have resisted adopting a proportionality test largely on the ground of the risk the courts will conduct a merits review of administrative decisions). The reality, however, is that courts apply proportionality with relatively low intensity in cases like this one where there are policy choices requiring the weighing of complex variables. The EU experience confirms this. In these cases, administrative decisions are quashed only where the change of policy is \"*manifestly disproportionate*\".60 Courts recognise that they are neither entitled, nor have the expertise, to second-guess the careful weighing of competing political, economic or social factors undertaken by state authorities and thus apply a higher threshold for annulling such decisions. In contrast, there is higher intensity of the review in cases involving the fundamental rights of individuals.\n\nP Craig, *EU Administrative Law* (OUP, 2018, 3rd edn) 644.\n\n105.\n\nIf proportionality were to be adopted as stand-alone element of the FET standard, then a further adjustment would have to be made in recognition of the fact that the remedy is for damages in investment arbitration rather than the typical administrative remedy of annulment of the decision. That may, in common with the EU approach to awarding compensation for breach of legitimate expectations, require a higher threshold for imposing liability.\n\n106.\n\nThe adoption of proportionality as the criterion for liability in disputes like the Spanish solar cases would give a new lease of life to the voluminous exchanges between regulatory experts whose efforts are largely ignored in the awards (if strict liability is imposed then there is little point in considering the reasons for the adoption of the disputed measures and the other alternatives available to the state authorities). But caution must attend this exercise. An argument set out in the Claimants' Reply will suffice to illustrate the point:\n\nSpain had other methods at its disposal to gain control over the tariff deficit, rather than cut incentives to PV facilities. The most obvious measure was to raise access tariffs for consumers, so that the prices that they paid for electricity more accurately reflected the actual costs of generating that electricity. As [the Claimants' regulatory expert] explains, Spain's failure to impose accurate costs has kept consumer prices artificially low.61\n\nC's Reply, \u00a7554.\n\n107.\n\nThere is no doubt that, as a matter of economic and regulatory theory, Spain could have preserved the tariffs in RD 661/2007 and addressed the tariff deficit (which by 2010 exceeded \u20ac25 billion) by raising prices for Spanish consumers. The problem is that when the disputed measures were introduced in 2013, the Spanish economy was in a deep recession triggered by the Global Financial Crisis, and the official unemployment rate in Spain was 26.1%.62 That is higher than it was for the United States during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The unemployment rate among those under 25 in Spain was reported to be above 50%. So as a matter of reality, there is unlikely to have been a great deal of capacity among Spanish electricity consumers in 2013 to pay for a considerable increase in electricity prices so that investors in PV facilities could avoid any haircut to their tariffs under RD 661/2007.\n\nAMG First Report, p. 16.\n\n108.\n\nIf a concept of proportionality were to be applied, international tribunals would, like the EU courts and national courts, have to calibrate the intensity of the review in circumstances where a state authority has had to weigh complex and competing interests to reach a compromise that by definition cannot give full force and effect to the demands of any particular group. They would also have to bear in mind that their judicial mandate is to achieve corrective justice when a State has committed a wrong rather than to indemnify foreign investors against the impact of a fair and transparent redistribution of scarce resources by a State in crisis.\n\n109.\n\nOther tribunals in the Spanish solar cases have sought to avoid the \"all-or-nothing\" approach to stability by sticking with the doctrine of legitimate expectations and interpreting RD 661/2007 as not generating an expectation among investors of the immutability of the tariffs for the special regime but as rather an expectation that they would continue to earn a reasonable rate of return.\n\n110.\n\nIn my assessment, the fact that the tariffs set in RD 661/2007 have to be based on the concept of a \"reasonable rate of return\" as set out in Law 54/1997 is one of the reasons that Article 44(3) RD 661/2007 cannot be interpreted as guaranteeing the immutability of the tariffs. If those tariffs, for whatever reason, fall out of line with the concept of a reasonable rate of return, then the Spanish Government would have to repeal RD 661/2007 and start again. This is precisely what had happened with the previous RD 436/2004 (and the Claimants admit that no legitimate expectations could have arisen from that regulation given the extent of the unexpected hikes in the tariffs).\n\n111.\n\nIt is another thing altogether to interpret RD 661/2007 as guaranteeing a reasonable rate of return but not the precise tariffs set out therein such that an expectation of the former would be deemed to be legitimate. I agree with the majority that the precise tariffs in RD 661/2007 reflect what the Spanish Government at the time thought was a reasonable rate of return. It is wrong to interpret RD 661/2007 as providing the Spanish Government with a discretion beyond the mechanism in Article 44 to adjust the tariffs to reflect a reasonable rate of return while RD 661/2007 was in force.\n\n112.\n\nBy trying to avoid the trap of strict liability, tribunals have thus walked into another, which is to place an artificial construction on RD 661/2007. They have started from the wrong premise\u2014immutability of something\u2014and tried to restrict its scope by limiting it to a reasonable rate of return rather than the precise tariffs in RD 661/2007.\n\n113.\n\nIn my preferred approach, the concept of a reasonable rate of return would play an important role in the proportionality assessment. In determining whether the disputed measure placed a disproportionate burden on the investor, it would be highly relevant to assess whether the investor continued to earn a reasonable rate of return after the disputed measure came into force. This again would breathe life into the voluminous exchanges between the quantum experts in this case as to what the \"target\" rate of return was for PV investments under RD 661/2007, what the average rate of return is for such investments on a comparative basis, and what rate of return the Claimants' projects are now earning under the new regime.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n114.\n\nI dissent from the majority's decision upholding liability based on the FET standard in Article 10 ECT as well as its decision on the principles of quantum.\n\nDate: 13 September 2022"}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Principles of Quantum\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| APPA | Association of Renewable Energy Producers |\n| APV | Adjusted Present Value |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| C-[#] | Claimants' Exhibit |\n| CAPM | Capital Asset Pricing Model |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty, which entered into force on 16 April 1998 (the \"**ECT**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Parties are the \"DSG Claimants\" - 65 limited liability partnerships, two private companies, and six individuals, all having German nationality,1 the full list of which is found below at paragraph 5 - and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Spain**\").\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 186.\n\n3.\n\nIn its 'Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility' dated 19 April 2021 (\"**Decision 1**\" or \"**Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\") the Tribunal set out its decisions on jurisdiction and admissibility, together with its reasoning and with summaries of the procedural history and the factual background to that case as they stood at the time. Decision 1 is incorporated in this Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Principles of Quantum (\"**Decision 4**\") by reference. It is attached to this Decision as **Appendix 1**.\n\n4.\n\nParagraph 326 of Decision 1 reads (internal references omitted) as follows:\n\n*VII. DECISION*\n\n*326. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:*\n\n*(1) The jurisdictional objection based upon the relationship between the ECT and EU law is rejected;*\n\n*(2) The jurisdictional objection based upon the tax carve-out in ECT Article 21 is upheld, and claims brought under ECT Article 10 based on the effect of the TVPEE are outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(3) The objection referred to as the multi-party objection is upheld in part, and the Tribunal decides that it will not proceed to determine the merits of the claims of the TS Claimants because they are not part of 'the dispute' that the Respondent agreed to arbitrate;*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal will proceed to determine the merits of the claims of the DSG Claimants;*\n\n*(5) A written submission may be made by (i) the group of DSG Claimants and (ii) the Respondent, in accordance with paragraphs 242-243 above, each explaining the position specifically in relation to the claims of DSG Claimants;*\n\n*(6) The Tribunal will take the necessary steps to proceed with the determination of the remaining questions, including questions bearing upon jurisdiction, relating to the DSG claims; and*\n\n*(7) The question of costs is reserved for decision in the context of its Award.*\n\n5.\n\nThe 73 DSG Claimants were identified in paragraph 2 of Decision 1.

Reply, fn. 6).\n\n6.\n\nParagraphs 252-253 of Decision 1 identified the remaining questions bearing upon jurisdiction. They read as follows:\n\n*252. The fact of these investments was not challenged by the Respondent, although their characterization as \"Investments\" and the possibility of them serving as the basis of a claim in this case was disputed. Those matters are most easily considered along with other substantive questions, and will therefore be addressed later, along with questions of merits and quantum.*\n\n*253. The Tribunal determines, with the reservation in the preceding paragraph concerning the status of their \"Investments\", that it has jurisdiction ratione personae over the DSG Claimants, and can proceed to consider the merits of their claims, subject to the remaining objections to jurisdiction ...*\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nParagraphs 242-244 of Decision 1 addressed the next procedural steps as follows:\n\n*In these circumstances the Tribunal has considered what steps, if any, are necessary to ensure that each Party has had a proper opportunity to present its case in respect of the DSG claims. While the Tribunal considers that with diligent analysis, greatly assisted by the Parties' respective Post-Hearing Briefs, it is possible to obtain a full picture of each Party's case in respect of the DSG claims, it also considers that it is in the interests of the sound administration of justice that, before it decides upon the merits of the DSG claims, the DSG Claimants be afforded the opportunity to make a short written submission which summarizes the position concerning the DSG claims that they have presented in their previous written and oral submissions. Similarly, the Respondent will be afforded the opportunity to make a short written submission which summarizes the position concerning the DSG claims that it has presented in its previous written and oral submissions. Thus, each Party will have the opportunity to explain briefly how it would have presented differently its case on the merits and quantum if it had been addressing only the DSG claims.*\n\n*The written submissions should be as concise as possible and should focus on explaining clearly any features of the Party's case that are specific to one or more of the DSG Claimants, and which the Party considers that it did not have an adequate opportunity to emphasize and distinguish from the submissions that it has made in relation to the DSG and TS claims as a whole. The submissions should assume (i) that the Tribunal is familiar with all of the written and oral submissions already made, and (ii) that it is unnecessary to make any further submissions in relation to matters that are not affected by the identities of the Claimants, such as the status and interpretation of Spanish laws and decrees. The DGS Claimants should file their submission by* ***Monday, 31 May 2021****, and the Respondent should file its submission by* ***Monday, 12 July 2021****.*\n\n*Existing submissions stand in the record, and these written submissions are intended to serve as aids to understanding them properly in the context of a case confined to the DSG claims. This is not intended to be an opportunity to present a wholly new case, materially different from that already put before the Tribunal. Any request to introduce or respond to any novel arguments or new evidence should be made separately to the Tribunal. The Tribunal will proceed to address the merits of the DSG claims once any submissions have been received.*3\n\nFootnote omitted.\n\n8.\n\nBy emails of 28 May 2021, the Parties agreed that the DSG Claimants would submit their brief by Friday, 4 June 2021, and that Spain would receive a similar extension to submit its brief by Friday, 16 July 2021.\n\n9.\n\nOn 4 June 2021, the DSG Claimants submitted their Supplemental Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n10.\n\nOn 16 June 2021, the Respondent sought leave to submit a memorandum prepared by Spain's quantum experts and a factual exhibit pursuant to paragraphs 242 and 244 of Decision 1. On 18 June 2021, the Tribunal informed the Respondent that it could make its proposed submissions.\n\n11.\n\nOn 16 July 2021, the Respondent submitted the Supplementary Memorial of the Kingdom of Spain following the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility,4 along with consolidated lists of exhibits and legal authorities, and the Supplementary Report in light of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 19 April 2021, dated 16 July 2021 and prepared by Grant Greatrex and Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez-Salguero. The Respondent also uploaded exhibit R-0410 and legal authorities RL-0157 through RL-0170 to the case Box folder.\n\nA corrected Spanish version of the Supplementary Memorial was filed on 6 August 2021, along with the English version of the submission.\n\n12.\n\nOn 30 September 2021, the Respondent filed a Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision dated 19 April 2021, dated 30 September 2021 (the \"**Request for Reconsideration**\"), along with the Consolidated List of Legal Authorities (RL) dated 30 September 2021 and legal authorities RL-0171 and RL-0172. The Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider its decision on the intra-EU jurisdictional objection.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 October 2021, the Claimants filed their Response to Spain's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision of 19 April 2021, along with their Consolidated Legal Authorities (Index) and legal authorities CL-230 to CL-238. The Claimants requested that the Tribunal reject the Request for Reconsideration.\n\n14.\n\nOn 6 December 2021, after deliberation, the Tribunal issued its 'Decision on the Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision dated 19 April 2021' (\"**Decision 2**\"). Decision 2 is incorporated in this Award by reference. It is attached to this Award as **Appendix 2**.\n\n15.\n\nParagraph 48 of Decision 2 reads as follows:\n\n*For the reasons given above, the Tribunal DECIDES:*\n\n*(i) That the Judgment of the CJEU in the* Komstroy *case does not warrant the reopening of the questions addressed and decided in the Tribunal's Decision of 19 April 2021; and*\n\n*(ii) That it will not alter its Decision of 19 April 2021.*\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 January 2022, the Respondent wrote to advise the Tribunal that it reserved its rights with respect to any potential grounds for annulment of the Award to be rendered in this proceeding. The Respondent did so \"to avoid any argument in the future (however baseless) that such grounds have been waived.\"\n\n17.\n\nOn 21 Feburary 2022, the Respondent sought leave to submit the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and the Principles of Quantum issued in *Sevilla Beheer B.V. and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/27), in accordance with paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n18.\n\nOn 1 March 2022, the Secretary of the Tribunal conveyed the following message from the Tribunal to the Parties:\n\n*The Tribunal has considered the Respondent's communication dated 21 February 2022, and recalls its decision of 24 January 2020 on the admission of the* BayWa *Decision and the* Stadtwerke*,* OperaFund *and* Cube *Awards into the record by the Tribunal. There it decided 'to allow the Parties to enter into the record the above-referred Decisions and Awards, including dissents, to the extent that they are publicly and freely available via the Internet and that either Party considers that the Tribunal should review them. ... [T]he Tribunal does not require hard copies: it will be sufficient to send a list of such Decisions and Awards together with an indication of their legal authority number and where on the Internet they are to be found. The Tribunal does not wish to receive comments on these additional legal authorities.'*\n\n*The Tribunal will admit the* Sevilla Beheer B.V. and others v. Spain *Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and the Principles of Quantum into the record on the same basis and under the same conditions.*\n\n19.\n\nOn 2 March 2022, the Respondent submitted a consolidated list of legal authorities which included a reference to RL-0173 - the *Sevilla Beheer B.V. and others v. Spain* Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and the Principles of Quantum - and RL-0174 - the Partial Dissenting Opinion by Professor Peter D Cameron -, along with a link to access the Decision and the Opinion.\n\n20.\n\nOn 24 June 2022, the Respondent filed a Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal Decision dated 19th April 2021 and the Tribunal's Decision dated 6th December 2021 (the \"**Respondent's Second Request for Reconsideration**\"), along with legal authority RL-0175 and the Respondent's updated list of legal authorities.\n\n21.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimants submitted their comments on the Respondent's Second Request for Reconsideration on Monday, 11 July 2022.\n\n22.\n\nOn 25 July 2022, The Tribunal issued the following decision on the Respondent's Second Request for Reconsideration (\"**Decision 3**\"):\n\n*The Tribunal has considered the submissions relating to the* Green Power *award, in which not only was the dispute between a national of one EU Member State and another EU Member State but the* lex arbitri *was the law of a third EU Member State. The Tribunal does not consider that the handing down of an award in another case that takes a view on a question of law that is different from the view taken by this Tribunal (and by many other tribunals) is a sufficient ground to warrant the reconsideration of its earlier decisions. The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 19 April 2021 is accordingly maintained.5*\n\nDecision 3 is incorporated in this Award by reference. It is attached to this Award as **Appendix 3**.\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly proceeds here to set out the sections of its Decision relating to the merits6 and the remaining questions concerning jurisdiction in respect of the claims of the DSG Claimants.\n\nIn this Decision, liability and principles of quantum.\n\n**III. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES**\n---------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants state that the main issue before the Tribunal is whether Spain should be permitted to induce foreign investment through a specific set of incentives and then, once the investments have been made, to \"fundamentally alter and abolish that framework [of incentives]\". In the Claimants' view this is, as affirmed by previous tribunals, exactly what happened in the case at hand and, as a consequence, the Respondent has harmed their investments and violated the ECT, as previously held in other cases involving Spain.7\n\nCl.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThis section draws on the parts of paragraphs 117\u2013159 of Decision 1 that are relevant to the claims of the DSG Claimants. It describes the main features of the Spanish regulatory regime applicable to the DSG Claimants' investments and the changes in the regime which underlie the claims in this case. Additional detail is given as necessary in the subsequent sections of this Decision that discuss the specific claims and defences put forward.\n\n28.\n\nAll of the DSG Claimants say that they invested in renewable energy plants in Spain in the context of the efforts of EU Member States, including Spain, to increase their use of renewable energy.\n\n29.\n\nSpain had set its national energy policy in a series of National Energy Plans, beginning in 1975, with the Plan for the years 1991-2000 (\"**PEN 1991**\") including provisions regarding the development of renewable energy production.8 The need for such development was brought into sharper focus by the work associated with the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in particular by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gases. In 2001, EU Directive 2001/77/EC set targets for the proportion of its energy that each Member State was to derive from renewable sources. Spain, which in 1997 derived around 19.9% of its energy from renewable sources, was given a target of 29.4%, to be achieved by 2020.9 That target sat alongside Spain's obligations under EU Law, which limit the grant of State Aid.10\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 79\u201397; PEN 1991, 13 September 1991 (C-044).\n\nDirective 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, 27 September 2001 (C-057). The correct percentage of energy derived from renewable sources in 1997 was 19.9%, and not 19.8% as inadvertently indicated in paragraph 119 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 347.\n\n30.\n\nInvestment in the renewable energy sector is front-loaded, with most of the expenditure being incurred as capital costs at the start of a project and the subsequent running and maintenance costs being relatively low, with the result that (as the Claimants put it) \"the cost of electricity produced from renewable sources is essentially fixed at the time of construction, whereas the cost of electricity from hydrocarbon sources is more variable depending on the cost over time of the fuel source and other inputs.\"11 That cost is largely fixed at the time of construction even if the costs of the technology subsequently fall (as they did in the case of PV plants). Renewable energy plants are, moreover, exposed to the vagaries of wind, sun and rain; and as it is difficult to store electricity on a large scale it is important that renewable power producers be able to sell their electricity when it is produced. Furthermore, the environmental and energy security benefits of renewable energy are economic externalities, not naturally reflected in the market price of the energy.12\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 114.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Joachim Kruck, 21 July 2016 (\"First Kruck WS\"), \u00b6 6; Cl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 112\u2013 118.\n\n31.\n\nIt was necessary for Spain to devise a scheme to attract the necessary investment in renewable energy. The background was provided by the main Spanish legislation, the Act or Law 54/1997 on the Electricity Sector.13 That Law distinguished between an \"Ordinary Regime\" applicable to electricity production from non-renewable sources and a \"Special Regime\" applicable to renewable energy production. The Special Regime, implemented through RD 2818/1998,14 provided two options for producers: (i) a Feed-In Tariff (\"**FIT**\") setting the price at which a producer would sell its entire production to electricity distributors, or alternatively (ii) a specified premium to be paid to producers who chose to sell their production on the wholesale electricity market. The tariffs and premium were expressly made subject to change. Provision was made for their revision every four years \"without prejudice to the stipulations of the eighth transitory provision of the 1997 Electricity Act, by taking into account the evolution of the price of electric power on the market, the participation of these facilities in coverage of demand and their impact on the technical management of the system.\"15 The \"eighth transitory provision\" of the 1997 Electricity Law required the Government to set premiums at rates that would provide certain renewable electricity plants with \"reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on the capital market.\"16 Similarly, Article 30(4) of the 1997 Law stated:\n\n*To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power to the network, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, the generation of economically justifiable useful heat and the investment costs incurred shall all be taken into account so as to achieve reasonable profitability.*17\n\nLaw 54/1997 on the Electric Power Sector, 27 November 1997 (\"Law 54/1997\") (R-0074/C-066).\n\nRoyal Decree 2818/1998 on the production of electrical energy by facilities supplied with renewable energy, waste or co-generation resources or sources, 23 December 1998 (\"RD 2818/1998\") (R-0082/C-067).\n\nRD 2818/1998, Article 32 (C-067).\n\nLaw 54/1997, Eighth transitory provision (R-0074).\n\nLaw 54/1997, Article 30(4) (R-0074). Article 30(3) stated \"The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations under the special regime shall satisfy the stipulations of point 1 of article 16 for electric power generators.\" Article 16(1) does not refer to \"reasonable profitability.\"\n\n32.\n\nThose provisions did not succeed in attracting the investment necessary for Spain to reach its targets for renewable energy production. By 2002, it had reached only 19.7% of the target to be reached in 2006 in relation to solar photovoltaic energy production.18 A new regime was established in March 2004 by RD 436/2004, replacing RD 2818/1998. The new regime allowed operators of renewable energy installations to choose between two remuneration mechanisms: (a) assigning their electricity to distributors at a fixed tariff which would be a single flat-rate in euro cents per kilowatt hour (the \"**fixed tariff**\" option); and (b) selling the electricity to distributors by participating in the market and receiving the market price supplemented by an incentive for participating in the market19 and a premium (the \"**market price + premium**\" option).20 The choice would be made annually by each operator, according to its own best interests. The Preamble to RD 436/2004 stated that \"[w]hichever remuneration mechanism is chosen, the Royal Decree guarantees operators of special regime installations fair remuneration for their investments and an equally fair allocation to electricity consumers of the costs that can be attributed to the electricity system [\u2026]\". It also stated that the Special Regime for renewable energy made it \"possible to reach the goal set out in the 1997 Electricity Act, i.e. to ensure that by the year 2010 renewable energy sources cover at least 12% of total energy demand in Spain.\"21\n\nCl. Mem., Table 4.1 and \u00b6\u00b6 131-134.\n\nBecause this was considered \"the way to minimise administrative intervention in the setting of electricity prices as well as to better, and more efficiently allocate the system costs.\" Royal Decree 436/2004 establishing the methodology for the updating and systematisation of the legal and economic regime for electric power production under the special regime, 12 March 2004 (\"RD 436/2004\"), Preamble (R-0084/C-075).\n\nRD 436/2004, Article 22 (R-0084/C-075).\n\nRD 436/2004, Preamble (R-0084/C-075).\n\n33.\n\nTariffs, premiums and incentives for each plant, which were significantly higher than those offered previously, were set for a period of 25 years, after which they were to be reduced to around 80% of their previous level.22 Article 40 of RD 436/2004 made provision for four-yearly revisions of the tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements payable to operators, with the revisions coming into force on January 1st of the second year subsequent to the year in which the revision was carried out. Article 40(3) contained an important provision. It stated that:\n\n*3. The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants that commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred to in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any previous tariffs and premiums.*\n\nRD 436/2004, Article 33 (R-0084/C-075); First Kruck WS, \u00b6 12.\n\n34.\n\nThus, the revised rates would not be applicable to existing plants, which would continue to operate under the rates previously set for them; and operators of plants to which the revised rates would be applicable would have at least twelve months' notice of that fact, so that they could adjust their plans prior to the commencement of operation of those plants.\n\n35.\n\nRD 436/2004 governed Spain's PV sector at the time that Mr. Joachim Kruck, one of the DG Claimants, began considering an investment in that sector in Spain, in the mid-2000s. Mr. Joachim Kruck already had experience of investment in renewable energy, including PV projects, in Germany through the family-owned business established by him and his father, Mr. Mathias Kruck. The company develops and manages commercial and residential properties as well as PV and wind projects, and maintains PV projects in Canada, Spain and Italy. Mr. Joachim Kruck learned that Spain was offering incentives for investment in the renewable energy sector.23 In 2006, there were indications that changes in the Spanish regulatory regime were being considered in order to accelerate investment in the renewable energy sector and enable Spain to reach its renewable energy targets.24 In the course of 2006, Mr. Kruck contacted and was contacted by a number of people, including a company that already had the rights to a 2.0MW development in Alcolea de Calatrava, south of Madrid. He spoke on several occasions to Ms. Mafalda Soto, a Spanish attorney fluent in German, about the proposed new regulatory regime, having already read about it in the German media and specialist magazines discussing the PV industry. Those changes in the regulatory regime eventually materialized as RD 661/2007,25 adopted on 25 May 2007 and published in the State Bulletin (the *Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado* or \"*BOE\"*) the following day.\n\nFirst Kruck WS, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6156-161.\n\nRoyal Decree 661/2007 regulating the activity of electricity production under the special regime, 25 May 2007 (\"RD 661/2007\") (R-0086/C-098).\n\n36.\n\nIt was asserted in the Request for Arbitration that the DSG Claimants began acquiring and developing projects in Spain in November 2006.26 The DSG Claimants' Supplemental Post Hearing Brief, however, states that \"the history should be distinguished from the specific Investments in respect of which Claimants have brought legal claims in this arbitration. Claimants made all of those investments in 2008.\"27 Significant changes to the regulatory regime were made by RD 661/2007, before the investments were made in 2008.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 12.\n\nCl. SPHB, \u00b6 7. The dates on which particular investments were made are considered in detail below.\n\n37.\n\nThe Preamble to RD 661/2007 noted that targets for certain renewable energy technologies \"are still far from being reached\", and described how the new regulatory regime would operate in developing renewable energy:\n\n*The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime a reasonable return on their investments, and the consumers of electricity an assignment of the costs attributable to the electricity system which is also reasonable, although incentives are provided to playing a part in this market since it is considered that in this manner lower government intervention will be achieved in the setting of prices, together with better, more efficient, attribution of the costs of the system, particularly in respect of the handling of diversions and the provisions of supplementary services. To this effect, a system which is analogous to that provided in Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, is maintained, in which the owner of the facility may opt to sell their energy at a regulated tariff, which will be the same for all scheduling periods, or alternatively to sell this energy directly on the daily market, the term market, or through a bilateral contract, in this case receiving the price negotiated in the market plus a premium. In this latter case, an innovation is introduced for certain technologies, namely upper and lower limits for the sum of the hourly price in the daily market, plus a reference premium, such that the premium to be received for each hour may be limited in accordance with these values. This new system protects the promoter when the revenues deriving from the market price falls excessively low, and eliminates the premium when the market price is sufficiently high to guarantee that their costs will be covered, thus eliminating irrationalities in the payment for the technologies the costs of which are not directly related to the prices of petroleum in the international markets.*\n\n38.\n\nThus, RD 661/2007 provided most operators of renewable electricity with an annual choice between fixed tariffs \u2013 the FIT option \u2013 and the market price + premium mechanism;28 but PV operators were eligible only for the FIT option.29 The tariffs were significantly higher \u2013 82% higher \u2013 than those payable under RD 436/2004, and were linked to Spain's Consumer Price Index (\"**CPI**\"), an objective reference point, rather than to a variable reference tariff (\"**TMR**\") that was fixed annually by a formula that allowed considerable discretion to the Government, as had been the case under RD 436/2004.30 Other supplements were also available under RD 661/2007.31 The tariffs were said to be payable to registered facilities for 25 years, and thereafter a tariff of 80% of the previous tariff would be paid.32 No limit was placed on the period for which the tariffs were available: they were understood to be available throughout the operational life of a facility, thus providing what was referred to as \"legal certainty\", enabling the commercial viability of a project to be determined with some certainty and precision.33\n\nRD 661/2007, Articles 24.1, 25 (R-0086/C-098).\n\nFirst Expert Report of Jaume Margarit \"Report on the Regulatory Framework to Promote Renewable Energy before RDL 9/2013 and its Determining Factors\", 7 July 2016 (\"Margarit ER\"), p. 28; RD 661/2007 (R-0086/C-098), Article 36, Table 3.

Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 182-185, fn. 313-323.\n\n39.\n\nRD 661/2007 stipulated that these tariffs were to be reviewed in 2010, and every four years thereafter. They could be amended, but it was stipulated that the amendments \"shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision shall have been performed\", thus preserving the position of facilities that were already in operation or in the course of planning and construction at the time of the review. The material provision is Article 44.3:\n\n*During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010, and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.*\n\n*The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.*34\n\nRD 661/2007, Article 44.3 (R-0086/C-098).\n\n40.\n\nThis attractive new scheme was a limited offer. RD 661/2007 set a target for the production to be derived from each kind of renewable energy facility: the \"target reference installed power\" for PV installations was 371 MW.35 The Decree provided that once 85% of that target had been reached, a cut-off date should be set after which date no more facilities could be registered and entitled to the tariffs set under the Decree. The cut-off date was to be set taking into account information on the fulfilment of the power target for each technology and the estimated period for the fulfilment of the corresponding target, and on \"the speed of implementation of new facilities and the average duration of the works for a standard project of any technology\", and the date could not be less than 12 months ahead.36 There was, accordingly, an incentive to establish PV facilities quickly in order to benefit from the scheme, and an obligation to allow a period within which projects already under construction might be completed before the scheme was closed.\n\nRD 661/2007, Article 37 (R-0086/C-098).\n\nRD 661/2007, Articles 21, 22 (R-0086/C-098).\n\n41.\n\nThe Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce issued a press release at the time that RD 661/2007 was adopted, which described the system established by the Decree:\n\n*Every 4 years the tariffs will be revised, bearing in mind compliance with the targets set. This will allow an adjustment to the tariffs in line with the new costs and the degree of compliance with the targets. The tariff revisions carried out in the future will not affect those installations already operating. This guarantee affords legal safety to the producer, providing stability to the sector and promoting its development. The new regulations will not be of a retroactive nature. The installations operating before January 1, 2008 may continue to adopt the previous regulations under the fixed tariff option throughout their working life.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The new text, which replaces Royal Decree 436/2004, fits into the energy policy commitment to drive forward the use of clean, native and efficient energies in Spain. The Government commitment to these energy technologies was the reason why the new regulations sought stability over time, which allows businessmen to carry out medium and long-term scheduling as well as a sufficient, fair return that, combined with stability, makes the investment and dedication to this activity attractive.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The new regulations will not be of a retroactive nature. The installations that are operational by January 1, 2008 may continue to adopt the previous regulations under the fixed tariff option throughout their operating life. When they take part in the market, they may maintain their prior regulation until December 31, 2012. These installations may voluntarily opt to abide by this new Royal Decree as from its publication.*\n\n*It will be in 2010 that the tariffs and premiums set out in the proposal will be revised in accordance with the targets set in the Renewable Energies Plan 2005-2010 and in the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy and in line with the new targets included in the following Renewable Energies Plan for the period 2011-2020.*\n\n*The revisions carried out in the future of the tariffs will not affect those Installations already in operation. This guarantee provides legal safety for the producer, affording stability to the sector and fostering its development.*37\n\nPress Release, \"The Government prioritizes profitability and stability in the new Royal Decree pertaining to renewable energies and cogeneration. Government commitment to clean and native energies,\" 25 May 2007 (\"Press Release for RD 661/2007\") (C-099).\n\n42.\n\nIn his witness statement dated 21 July 2016, Mr. Joachim Kruck wrote of his view of the new regime:\n\n*The incentives under RD 661/2007 offered investors a fixed long-term tariff at rates equal or even higher \u2013 for relatively large facilities \u2013 than those offered under RD 436/2004. The full tariff would apply for twenty-five years, after which the facility would receive approximately 80% of the fixed tariff rate for the duration of the life of the facility. Further, the tariff would be adjusted annually under the consumer price index (CPI), which was also a clear indication that Spain would not arbitrarily modify the tariff in future years. Notably, the decree ensured that once a facility had been granted rights under the applicable tariff regime, any future revisions to the tariff rates would not impact those facilities. Thus, it was critically important for us to develop and finalize our facilities quickly so that they would receive the RD 661/2007 tariffs.*38\n\nFirst Kruck WS, \u00b6 16.\n\n43.\n\nRD 661/2007 proved very successful in attracting investment in PV facilities, and the level of 85% of the 371 MW target was passed by September 2007.39 It was announced, in accordance with the terms of RD 661/2007, that no further registrations would be allowed under the scheme after 29 September 2008.40 Facilities registered after that date would, therefore, not be eligible for the tariffs set in RD 661/2007.\n\nResolution of the General Energy Secretariat which sets forth the regulated tariff maintenance period for the photovoltaic technology, pursuant to article 22 of Royal Decree 661/2007, 27 September 2007 (\"Resolution of 27 September 2007\") (C-151). It records that the \"Board of Directors of the National Energy Commission, in its meeting dated September 27, 2007, conclud[ed] that on August 31, 2007, the percentage reached with regard to the installed power for solar photovoltaic technology is 91 percent, and that 100 percent of the target shall be achieved in the month of October 2007.\"\n\nResolution of 27 September 2007 (C-151).\n\n44.\n\nThis was the regulatory regime that was in place when the DSG Claimants made the first of the investments in PV plants in respect of which claims are made in this case. As the Claimants' Supplemental Post-Hearing Brief notes,\n\n*4.* [\u2026] *this case involves broadly two different types of Investments protected by the ECT: (i) ownership interests in Spanish companies and PV plants in Spain, and (ii) contractual rights associated with those PV plants, which include, for certain Claimants, a right to a bonus payment in the event the respective PV plants exceeded a threshold electricity production target, and, for other Claimants, a right to purchase the Spanish SPVs and their respective PV plants after 25 years of operation.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*8. With respect to the first type of Investment at issue, there can be no dispute that Claimants Solar Andaluz 1-20 GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Solarpark Calasparra 251-265 GmbH &amp; Co. KG, and Solarpark Tordesillas 401-430 GmbH &amp; Co. KG each invested in a single 100 kW PV plant in Spain through the plants' respective Spanish SPVs between February and August 2008. In fact, the Tribunal correctly has acknowledged that the \"core DSG Claimants' investments in the PV plants were completed by the end of August 2008, before the closure of registration under RD 661/2007 and before the enactment of RD 1578/2008, both of which are significant events in this case.\"*\n\n*9. With respect to the second type of Investments, there similarly can be no dispute that Claimants DSG Deutsche Solargesellschaft mbH (\"DSG GmbH\"), Joachim Kruck, Peter Flachsmann, Ralf Hofmann, Rolf Schumm, and Frank Schumm\u2014who own the respective contract rights in question\u2014 acquired those Investments in 2008.*41\n\nCl. SPHB \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8-9 (footnotes omitted).\n\n45.\n\nIn the light of the success of RD 661/2007, further legislation was adopted in 2008. RD 1578/2008 was adopted on 26 September 2008. By that time, each of the companies who are Claimants 1-20 (referring to the list at paragraph 5, above) had, on 28 February 2008, purchased the assets of one of the Project Alcolea PV plants through the Claimant company's wholly-owned Spanish subsidiary.42 Similarly, Claimants 21-35 had, on 21 August 2008, each purchased the assets of one of the Project Calasparra PV plants; and each of Claimants 36-65, also on 21 August 2008, had purchased the assets of one of the Project Tordesillas PV plants, and again in each case through the Claimant company's wholly-owned Spanish subsidiary.43 The position of Claimant 66 (DSG Deutsche Solargesellschaft mbH), Claimant 67 (DSG Spanien Verwaltungs GmbH), Claimant 68 (Mr. Mathias Kruck), Claimant 69 (Mr. Joachim Kruck), Claimant 70 (Mr. Peter Flachsmann), Claimant 71 (Mr. Ralf Hofman), Claimant 72 (Mr. Rolf Schumm), and Claimant 73 (Mr. Frank Schumm) is more complicated; but, anticipating conclusions reached below,44 it can be said that for practical purposes all of their investments that are material and in principle compensable in the present case were made under the regulatory regime established by RD 661/2007.\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6 56.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 205-207 below.\n\n46.\n\nWhile none of the investments in issue in the present case was made under the terms of the RD 1578/2008 regime, it is helpful to give an account of it and of later developments in order that the development of the Spanish regulatory regime can be properly understood. As has been noted, RD 1578/2008 was adopted on 26 September 2008.45 It established an amended and extended version of the 2007 scheme for PV plants. The purpose of RD 1578/2008 was explained in a Press Release that accompanied its adoption:\n\n*The development of this sector in Spain has totally outperformed the forecasts in 2005. To be precise, the target set for 2010 to attain 371 MW of photovoltaic energy was achieved in August 2007 and it is estimated that installed power at year-end 2008 will be fivefold the power target for 2010. Hence, since said goal has been surpassed, it is necessary to determine a new long-term target and a new legal framework which allows the continuity of the success achieved by this sector in Spain at reasonable costs. With this in mind, a Royal Decree has been approved which will allow 3,000 MW to be attained in 2010 and around 10,000 MW in 2020.*46\n\nRoyal Decree 1578/2008 on remuneration for production of electricity using solar photovoltaic technology for facilities after the deadline for maintaining the remuneration of RD 661/2007, 26 September 2008 (\"RD 1578/2008\") (R-0087/C-046).\n\nPress Release, The Government Approves the New Economic Regime for Solar Photovoltaic Technology Installations, 26 September 2008 (\"Press Release for RD 1578/2008\") (C-138).\n\n47.\n\nWhile the financial incentives offered under RD 436/2004 had failed to attract sufficient investment in PV facilities, those offered under RD 661/2007 had shown themselves to be more generous than was necessary to achieve Spain's targets for renewable energy. The Preamble to RD 1578/2008 explained the thinking on this matter:\n\n*Just as insufficient compensation would make the investments nonviable, excessive compensation could have significant repercussions on the costs of the electric power system and create disincentives for investing in research and development, thereby reducing the excellent medium-term and long-term perspectives for this technology. Therefore, it is felt that it is necessary to rationalize compensation and, therefore, the royal decree that is approved should modify the economic regime downward, following the expected evolution of the technology, with a long-term perspective.*47\n\nRD 1578/2008, Preamble (R-0087).\n\n48.\n\nRD 1578/2008 accordingly set up a new \"economic regime for facilities generating electric power with photovoltaic technology, to which the regulated tariff rates provided in Article 36 of Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May, on the activity of electricity power generation under the special regime, are not applicable because of their date of final registration.\"48 These PV facilities, coming into operation too late to claim the benefit of RD 661/2007 tariffs, were offered markedly lower tariffs; but the tariffs payable to existing projects registered under RD 661/2007 were not affected.49\n\nRD 1578/2008, Article 1 (C-046).\n\nRD 1578/2008, Articles 2, 11(6) (R-0087/C-046).\n\n49.\n\nFacilities could establish their entitlement to the tariffs under the 2008 regime by a form of 'pre-assignment registration' or 'pre-registration' at the beginning of the development of a project,50 which would provide \"the necessary legal security to promoters with respect to the return that the facility will earn once it is put into operation.\"51 Pre-registration was conditional upon submission of specified documents, such as permits from the local authorities, permission to access the electricity grid, and a bond guaranteeing the facilities' ultimate connection to the grid; and registration was effected chronologically, in the order in which completed applications were filed.52 The tariffs were again offered on a restricted basis, limited by annual capacity quotas applied at each round in which electricity capacity was sought.53\n\nRD 1578/2008, Article 4 (R-0087/C-046).\n\nRD 1578/2008, Preamble (R-0087).\n\nRD 1578/2008, Appendix II (R-0087).\n\nRD 1578/2008, Article 5 (R-0087/C-046).\n\n50.\n\nRD 1578/2008 contained a number of other significant features. It was stipulated that \"the regulated rate that is applicable to a facility under this royal decree shall be maintained for a maximum period of twenty-five years after the date of the last of the following to occur: the start-up date or the date of the registration of the facility in the compensation pre-assignment registry.\"54 RD 661/2007, in contrast, had not set a limit on the operational life of a facility during which the specified tariffs could be claimed.\n\nRD 1578/2008, Article 11(5) (R-0087).\n\n51.\n\nFurthermore, RD 1578/2008 provided for an adjustment of the tariffs in 2012 in the light of the operation of the 2008 scheme:\n\n*Fifth additional provision.* Modification of the compensation for generation by photovoltaic technology*.*\n\n*During the year 2012, based on the technological evolution of the sector and the market, and the functioning of the compensatory regime, compensation for the generation of electric power by photovoltaic solar technology may be modified.*55\n\nRD 1578/2008 (R-0087). \"Disposici\u00f3n adicional quinta.

The removal by RD 1565/2010 of the entitlement to the original FIT after 25 years had led to criticism from investors. RDL 14/2010 responded to the criticism by extending the fixed 25-year period to 28 years60 (and subsequently, in 2011, to 30 years)61, thus \"largely offset[ting] the economic impact of the elimination of the tariff at the 80% level thereafter\".62\n\nRDL 14/2010, Preamble, \u00b6 4 and First Final Provision (R-0073).\n\nLaw 2/2011 of Sustainable Economy, 4 March 2011 (\"Law 2/2011\"), 44th Final Provision (amending RDL 14/2010 First Final Provision) (R-0060/C-095) (Spanish version).\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 315, fn. 622.\n\n57.\n\nThe third measure identified by the Claimants is Law 15/2012, which imposed a 7% 'energy tax'.63 This, Claimants say, \"was indistinguishable from a straightforward 7% reduction in the tariff rates guaranteed by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.\"64\n\nLaw 15/2012 regarding fiscal measures for energy sustainability, 27 December 2012 (\"Law 15/2012\") (R-0018/C-040).\n\nCl.

One of the bases of this tax system reform will therefore be the internalization of the environmental costs arising from the production of electrical energy* [\u2026]*.*\n\n*For this purpose and also with a view to favouring budgetary balance, Title I of this Act establishes a tax on the value of the production of electrical energy, of a direct and real nature, which is levied on the performance of activities of production and incorporation into the electricity system of electrical energy in the Spanish electricity system.*65\n\nLaw 15/2012, Preamble (R-0018).\n\n59.\n\nFourth, on 1 February 2013 Spain enacted RDL 2/2013, \"on urgent measures in the energy sector and in the financial sector.\"66 That law changed the basis for the calculation of the indexing of the feed-in tariffs, so as to use an \"amended\" consumer price index. The Claimants say that \"the effect of this change was to reduce the inflation adjustment by about three percentage points (from +2.98% to -0.03%).\"67\n\nRoyal Decree-Law 2/2013 on urgent measures in the energy sector and in the financial sector, 1 February 2013 (\"RDL 2/2013\") (R-0078/C-083).\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 333.\n\n60.\n\nThe thinking behind the change was explained in the Preamble to RDL 2/2013:\n\n*The data reported by the National Energy Commission in its report 35/2012 of the 20th of December on the order proposal establishing the access tolls are established from the 1st of January 2013 and tariffs and premiums of special regime facilities, has revealed the appearance of new deviations in estimates of costs and revenues caused by various factors, both for the end of 2012 and 2013, that in the current economic context, would render almost unfeasible their coverage with electric tolls and the items prescribed from the State General Budget.*\n\n*These deviations are due largely to a higher growth in the cost of the special regime, due to an increase in the operation hours exceeding the projected and an increase in the compensation values after indexing to the Brent price, and a reduction of toll revenues due to a very sharp drop in demand which is consolidated for this exercise.*\n\n*The proposed alternative would be a further increase in access tolls paid by electricity consumers. This measure would affect directly household economies and corporal* [sic] *competitiveness, both in a delicate situation, given the current economic situation.*\n\n*Given this scenario, in order to alleviate this problem the Government has decided to adopt certain cost-reduction urgent measures to avoid the assumption of a new effort by consumers; helping them, through consumption and investment, to collaborate as well for the economic recovery.*\n\n*Consequently, with the purpose of using a more stable index which is not affected by the volatility of unprocessed foods no*[r] *those from domestic fuels, all those remuneration updating methodologies that are linked to CPI shall substitute it by the Consumption Price Index to constant taxes with no unprocessed food nor energy products.*68\n\nRDL 2/2013, Preamble (R-0078).\n\n61.\n\nThe fifth step was the replacement of the \"Special Regime\" for renewable energy, which had existed since 1994 and included the tariffs fixed by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, with a new regime. The Claimants point to a series of measures that had this effect,69 beginning with RDL 9/2013, establishing \"urgent measures to ensure the financial stability of the electricity system\",70 which was adopted on 12 July 2013. The Respondent, in contrast, emphasizes the continuity of the basic principles on which both the old and the new regimes were based.71\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 335.\n\nRoyal Decree-Law 9/2013 which sets forth urgent measures to ensure the financial stability of the electricity system, 12 July 2013 (\"RDL 9/2013\") (R-0079/C-091).\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 864\u2013982.\n\n62.\n\nThe lengthy Preamble to RD 9/2013 describes in some detail Spain's repeated efforts to devise a satisfactory regime for electricity production and the issues faced as a result of unexpected difficulties, including the world economic crisis. These considerations pointed to \"the unsustainable nature of the deficit of the electricity sector and the need to adopt urgent measures of an immediate effect that would put an end to this situation.\"72 The Preamble outlined the new regime that was to be introduced:\n\n*It shall be based on receiving the revenue derived from participation in the market, with an additional return that, if necessary, shall cover those investment costs that an efficient and well-managed company does not recover in the market. In this sense, according to community case law, a company shall be deemed as being efficient and well-managed if it has the necessary means for the development of its field, whose costs are those of an efficient enterprise in that field and considering the corresponding revenue and a reasonable profit for the execution of its functions. The aim is to ensure that the high costs of an inefficient company are not taken as reference.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*This framework shall articulate a remuneration that shall allow renewable energy, cogeneration, and waste facilities to cover the costs necessary to compete in the market at an equal level with the rest of technologies and get a reasonable rate of return.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*In this way, the Law carries out a balanced allocation of the costs attributable to the electricity system, electrical consumers and taxpayers, to the extent in which part of these costs are financed under the General State Budget.*\n\n*Furthermore, Law 54/1997, of 27 November, stipulates the regulation on the concept of reasonable rate of return, setting it, in line with the legal principles on the particular case law developed within the last few years, within project profitability that will be focused, prior to taxes, on the average yield in the secondary market of State Obligations within ten years, by applying the appropriate differential.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*In this way, the aim is to consolidate the continuous adaptation that the regulation has experienced, in order to keep this reasonable rate of return through a predictable system, subject to temporary realisation.*73\n\nRDL 9/2013, Preamble (R-0079).\n\nRDL 9/2013, Preamble (R-0079).\n\n63.\n\nRDL 9/2013 prescribed a \"reasonable rate of return\" for PV investments:\n\n*For purposes of the provisions of the penultimate paragraph of Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997, of 27 November, for the facilities that as of date of the entry into force of this Royal Decree law have the right to a feed-in tariff scheme, the reasonable rate of return shall focus, before taxes, on the average yield in the secondary market for ten years prior to the entry into force of this Royal Decree-Law of the Obligations of the State within ten years*74 *increased by 300 basic points, without prejudice to the revision envisaged in the last paragraph of that article.*75\n\n*I.e.*, 10-year Spanish Treasury bonds.\n\nRDL 9/2013, Preamble and First Additional Provision (R-0079). Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 is quoted *supra*, at \u00b6 30. A later measure defined 300 basis points above the average historic yield (over ten years) on Spanish ten-year treasury bonds as 7.398%: *see* Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 adopting the remuneration parameters of standard facilities applicable to certain electrical energy production plants using renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste, 16 June 2014 (\"Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014\"), Annex III, Article 1.3 (R-0101/C-179). The Brattle Regulatory Report, at \u00b6 189, states that the ten-year average became a two-year historical average in the periodic reviews provided for in the NRR, with the result (as a consequence of falling interest rates) that the reasonable rate of return falls.\n\n64.\n\nWhile RDL 9/2013 indicated the shape of things to come, it did not itself set out the new regulatory regime (\"**NRR**\") in detail. In the words of the Preamble to RD 413/2014,76 RDL 9/2013 \"explicitly outlined the principles upon which the framework to be applied to these facilities is to be based, pursuant to the terms that were later included in Act 24/2013, of 26th December, on the Electricity Sector, and which are developed herein.\" The necessary detail was added by Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014, and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, which together constitute the NRR.\n\nRoyal Decree 413/2014 regulating the production of electrical energy from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste, 6 June 2014 (\"RD 413/2014\"), Preamble (R-0095).\n\n65.\n\nLaw 24/2013, adopted on 26 December 2013,77 once more recalled in its Preamble Spain's successive attempts since 1997 to establish a stable and sustainable economic and financial system applicable to energy production. It provided a helpful summary of the position at that time:\n\n*Essentially, the continuous normative changes have entailed an important distortion to the normal operation of the electrical system and which needs to be corrected through action by the legislator which lends the regulatory stability that electrical activity requires. This regulatory safety, combined with the need to undertake the reforms needed to ensure the sustainability of system in the long-term and to resolve the existing shortcomings in system operation would recommend the approval of an overall reform of the sector, based on a new income and expenses regime for the electrical system which tries to return to the system the financial sustainability it lost a long time ago and whose eradication has not been achieved to date through the adoption of partial measures.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The present Law essentially sets out to establish the regulation for the Electrical Sector, ensuring electrical supply with the necessary quality levels and at the lowest possible cost, to ensure the economic and financial sustainability of the system and allow an effective competition level in the Electrical Sector, all within the environmental protection principles of a modern society.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The widespread awareness of the tariff deficit situation and the consequent threat to the very feasibility of the electrical system has led to the need to make major changes to the remuneration regime for regulated activities. In view of the progressive deterioration in the sustainability of the electrical system, the legal entities in the latter could no longer legitimately trust the maintenance of the parameters which had degenerated into the situation described and any diligent operator could anticipate the need for these changes.*\n\n*For activities with regulated remuneration, the Law reinforces and clarifies the principles and criteria for establishing the remuneration regimes to which end the necessary costs will be considered to carry out activity by an efficient, well-managed company through the application of homogeneous criteria throughout Spain. These economic regimes will allow appropriate returns to be obtained with regard to the activity risk.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The technical and economic management of the system essentially maintains the other remuneration criteria, incorporating into the system operator's remuneration incentives for the reduction of system costs deriving from the operation.*\n\n*The high penetration of production technologies deriving from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste, included in the so-called special regime for electrical energy production, has meant that its unique regulation connected with power and its technology lacks any object. By contrast, it makes it necessary for regulation to consider these installations in a similar way to those of other technologies which will be integrated into the market and, in any case, for them to be considered because of their technology and impacts on the system, rather than because of their power which is why the differentiated concepts of ordinary and special regime are abandoned. This is why unified regulation is being carried out without prejudice to any unique considerations which need to be established.*\n\n*The remuneration regime for renewable energies, cogeneration and waste will be based on the necessary participation in the market of these installations, complemented by market income with specific regulated remuneration which enables these technologies to compete on an equal footing with the other technologies on the market. This specific complementary remuneration will be sufficient to attain the minimum level required to cover any costs which, by contrast to conventional technologies, they cannot recover on the market and will allow them to obtain a suitable return with reference to the installation type applicable in each case.*78\n\nLaw 24/2013 regarding the Electrical sector, 26 December 2013 (\"Law 24/2013\") (R-0062/C-180).\n\nLaw 24/2013, Preamble (R-0062).\n\n66.\n\nLaw 24/2013 set out a number of measures intended to address the widening gap between the costs of providing electricity and the revenue derived from it \u2013 the \"tariff deficit\". It was, however, RD 413/2014, adopted on 6 June 2014,79 that was the main instrument in the establishment of the NRR.\n\nRD 413/2014 (R-0095/C-090).\n\n67.\n\nYet again, the Preamble to RD 413/2014 provided a detailed and frank account of the development of Spanish policy on renewable energy regulation. In relation to the Special Regime for renewable energy as it was provided for by RD 661/2007 it said:\n\n*Although, considering the circumstances existing at each moment in time, these provisions permitted the achievement of the purposes for which they were introduced, it cannot be overlooked that the forecasts prevailing when they were adopted were soon surpassed as a result of the highly favourable support framework. This circumstance, together with the fact that the costs of technology were gradually falling, made it necessary to make a series of amendments to the regulatory framework in order to guarantee both the principle of reasonable return and the financial sustainability of the system itself.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The measures adopted between 2009 and 2011 proved insufficient for fulfilling their intended aims and the regulatory framework was found to be suffering from certain failings\u2014which remained uncorrected despite the huge effort made to adapt the regulation\u2014seriously compromising the system's financial sustainability. This situation led to the adoption of Royal Decree-Act 1/2012, of 27th January, which suspended the remuneration pre-allocation procedures and withdrew financial incentives for new facilities generating electrical energy through cogeneration or from renewable energy sources or waste, and Royal-Decree Law 2/2013, of 1st February, on urgent measures for the electricity system and the financial sector, which, among other measures, amended Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25th May, eliminating the \"market price plus premium\" option applicable to certain technologies and establishing tariff-based remuneration for all special regime facilities, while at the same time modifying the criteria for updating the remuneration of regulated activities in the electricity system.*\n\n*In this context\u2014it having become apparent that the financial sustainability of the electricity system had to be guaranteed, that the successive amendments to the regulation required consolidation (among other reasons, to ensure the stringent and correct application of the principle of reasonable return), and that the regulatory framework needed to be reviewed in order to adapt it to the actual circumstances of the industry\u2014 Royal Decree-Act 9/2013, of 12th July, on urgent measures to ensure the financial stability of the electricity system, was passed.*80\n\nRD 413/2014, Preamble (R-0095).\n\n68.\n\nThe main features of the NRR were described as follows:\n\n*Under this new framework, in addition to the remuneration earned by selling energy at market rates, facilities may also receive specific remuneration throughout their regulatory useful lives. This specific remuneration comprises an amount per unit of installed capacity, intended to cover any investment costs incurred by a standard facility that cannot be recovered through the sale of its energy on the market, known as \"compensation for investments\"; and an amount linked to operations, intended to cover any difference between a standard facility's operating costs and the revenue generated from its participation in the energy production market, known as \"compensation for operations\".*\n\n*The compensation for investments and compensation for operations applicable to a standard facility are to be calculated based on standard revenues from the sale of energy valued at market rates, standard operating costs required to perform the activity and the standard value of the initial investment\u2014all three standard values established on the basis of an efficient, well-managed company. A set of compensation benchmarks will be established for each standard facility by order of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism* [\u2026]*.*\n\n*The compensation for investments\u2014and, where applicable, the compensation for operations\u2014aims to cover the higher costs incurred by facilities that produce electricity from renewable energy, high-efficiency cogeneration and waste, so that they may compete on an equal footing with other technologies and obtain a reasonable return by reference to the standard facility applicable in each case.*\n\n*Moreover, the concept of \"reasonable return\" on a project is introduced into the regulatory framework. In line with legal scholarship on this matter in recent years, reasonable return is set as a pre-tax return approximately equal to the average yield on ten-year government bonds in the secondary market for the 24-month period leading up to the month of May of the year prior to the commencement of a given regulatory period, increased by a spread.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Regulatory periods are to have a six-year duration. The first regulatory period spans from the date of entry into force of Royal Decree-Act 9/2013, of 12th July, to 31st December 2019. Each regulatory period is divided into two half-periods of three years each; the first half-period runs from the date of entry into force of Royal Decree 9/2013, of 12th July, to 31st December 2016.*\n\n*The compensation benchmarks may be adjusted as part of a review conducted at the end of each regulatory half-period or period, pursuant to Article 14.1 of Act 24/2013, of 26th December.*\n\n*All compensation benchmarks may be adjusted in the corresponding review, including the value upon which reasonable return is to be based over the remaining regulatory life of standard facilities.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Once a facility's regulatory useful life*81 *has elapsed, it will no longer receive the compensation for investments or compensation for operations. Such facilities may remain in operation, receiving only the remuneration earned on energy sales on the market.*82\n\nThe regulatory life of an installation was to be \"the useful regulatory life of the associated standard facility\u2014as set forth in a ministerial order to be issued the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, subject to prior approval by the Government's Executive Committee for Economic Affairs\": RD 413/2014 (R-0095), Article 28(1). It was set at 30 years for all PV installations.\n\nRD 413/2014, Preamble (R-0095).\n\n69.\n\nThe NRR established a flexible system under which remuneration to an actual PV installation was calculated by considering the position of a hypothetical \"standard installation\", and making payments to supplement the market price for electricity.83 There was an \"investment incentive\" or \"compensation for investments (**Rinv**)\" calculated per MW of installed capacity, and an 'operating incentive' or \"compensation for operations (**Ro**)\" calculated per MWh of electricity production.84 The incentives were explicitly subject to review and to change over time.\n\nRD 413/2014, Article 11 (R-0095/C-090).\n\nRD 413/2014, Article 11(6)(a) and (b), respectively (R-0095/C-090).\n\n70.\n\nThe details of the \"standard installations\" were set out in Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, of 16 June 2014.85 The Order defines 578 \"standard installations\" in the PV sector, and sets out detailed parameters, including the \"regulatory useful life\" (30 years for all PV installations),86 the \"operation threshold\" (below which no incentives (Rinv or Ro) were payable) and the minimum operation hours required (up to which only a proportion of the Rinv and Ro was payable),87 and the maximum operating hours for which the Rinv and Ro would be payable.88\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014 (R-0101/C-179).\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014, Article 5 (R-0101/C-179).\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014, Article 7 (R-0101/C-179).\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014, Article 8 (R-0101/C-179).\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants' case is that the NRR in effect \"abolished the incentives regime entirely and replaced it with a completely different regulatory paradigm.\"89 The Respondent rejects the Claimants' view and maintains that the NRR was \"the foreseeable result of the [Spanish Electricity System (\"**SES**\")], in accordance with its principles and objectives.\"90\n\nCl.

As to the jurisdictional aspect, *see* the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Section V.B.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nICSID Article 42(1) clearly identifies the law to be applied by the Tribunal. It provides that\n\n*(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.*\n\n77.\n\nIn this case the Parties have by agreeing to arbitration under ECT Article 26, and specifically under Article 26(4), agreed on the law to be applied by the Tribunal. ECT Article 26(6) provides that:\n\n*A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.*\n\n78.\n\nIt is plain that the dispute is to be decided in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law. The only question in the present case is whether, as the Respondent submits \"EU Law [\u2026] is in fact international law directly applicable to the merits of this dispute, in accordance with Article 26 ECT [\u2026]\"99\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 93.\n\n79.\n\nAlthough its origins and main focus of membership lies in Europe, the ECT is an international agreement, with States Parties from many parts of the globe. The Contracting Parties include, for example, Australia, Iceland, Japan, Mongolia, Turkey and Yemen; and the ECT Observers include, for example, Algeria, Canada, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the USA, and Venezuela. The ECT provides for limited modifications of its applicability to particular States, for example in Articles 26(3) and 32. Otherwise, there is no reason to suppose that the applicability of the rules and principles in the ECT will vary from State to State. Similarly, there is no reason to suppose that the \"rules and principles of international law\" to which ECT Article 26(6) refers will vary from State to State. The Tribunal also considers that there is no reason to suppose that the term \"international law\" in ECT Article 26(6) has a meaning different from the term \"international law\" in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal considers that the question whether EU Law \"is in fact international law\" must be viewed in this context, and that the question has one answer, applicable as between any and all ECT Contracting Parties.\n\n80.\n\nThe term \"international law\" has an \"ordinary meaning\"100 that is well understood, and epitomised by the familiar description of the various sources and evidences of international law that appears as Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.101 That meaning accords with the logic of the uniform application of the ECT. International law, as the body of rules and principles recognised by States as binding and applicable in the relations between them, is to be distinguished from municipal laws, which vary from State to State and are created by and applicable in each individual State.\n\nTo which the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), Article 31(1) refers (CL-049).\n\nAs earlier ICSID tribunals have noted: *see*, *e.g*., *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, \u00b6 116 (CL-056). The Report of the Executive Directors attached to the ICSID Convention takes the same approach:  \n\"Under the Convention an Arbitral Tribunal is required to apply the law agreed by the parties. Failing such agreement, the Tribunal must apply the law of the State party to the dispute (unless that law calls for the application of some other law), as well as such rules of international law as may be applicable. The term \"international law\" as used in this context should be understood in the sense given to it by Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, allowance being made for the fact that Article 38 was designed to apply to inter-State disputes.\" (Report of the Executive Directors, \u00b6 40, https://icsid.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/ICSID%20Convention%20English.pdf).\n\n81.\n\nWithin the EU, EU Law has a privileged status by virtue of the principles of its supremacy and its direct effect. But on the international stage it is a regional legal system. Like municipal laws, it has a very important role the development of international law, for example by forming the basis of State practice that contributes to the generation of \"international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law\", and contributes to the creation and definition of the body of \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.\"102 It is also relevant as a matter of fact; and, of course, the analyses of issues and laws by the judges who sit within any relevant legal system always merit respectful consideration. What EU law and municipal law cannot do, under ECT Article 26, is have dispositive legal force, definitively determining whether acts and omissions are or are not compatible with the international law obligations undertaken by the States that are Contracting Parties to the ECT. Put in other words, in the absence of some provision in the ECT admitting that EU law can alter the scope and content of rights and duties established by the ECT, EU law cannot have such an effect.\n\nThe quoted phrases appear in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal will accordingly decide the issues in dispute in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n**VI. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n83.\n\nInitially it is necessary to return to questions of jurisdiction and admissibility in order to identify the investments in respect of which this Tribunal has jurisdiction. The Tribunal recalls the definition of 'investment' under Article 1(6) of the Energy Charter Treaty, which reads as follows:\n\n*\"Investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:*\n\n*(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;*\n\n*(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;*\n\n*(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value and associated with an Investment;*\n\n*(d) Intellectual Property;*\n\n*(e) Returns;*\n\n*(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.*\n\n*A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments and the term \"Investment\" includes all investments, whether existing at or made after the later of the date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of the Investor making the investment and that for the Contracting Party in the Area of which the investment is made (hereinafter referred to as the \"Effective Date\") provided that the Treaty shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective Date.*\n\n*\"Investment\" refers to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a Contracting Party in its Area as \"Charter efficiency projects\" and so notified to the Secretariat.*\n\n84.\n\nThe DSG Claimants' Supplemental Post-Hearing Brief lists the \"DSG Claimants' Investments.\"103 The list identifies those investments in respect of which compensation is claimed, compensation for losses resulting from the remainder being subsumed within compensation that is claimed. The list reads as follows (the highlighted investments are the 'contractual' claims, as explained below):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **DSG Claimants\u2019 Investments** |\n| **No** | **Claimant** | **Project(s)** | **Investment and Ownership Share** | **Allocation of Compensation Claimed** |\n| 1-20 | Solar Andaluz 1-20 GmbH & Co.

SPHB, pp. 8-10.\n\n85.\n\nThe investments in respect of which compensation is claimed fall into three groups. First, each of claims 1-65 is a claim made by a German company (GmbH & Co. KG) in respect of 100% of a corresponding Spanish SPV and 100 kW PV facility. The Tribunal has no doubt that each is a genuine investment by a German investor in Spain, and within the definition of an investment in ECT Article 1(6) and within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that the requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are met in relation to each of the investments.\n\n87.\n\nSecond, claim 66 is made by a German company, DSG GmbH, which was the operations and maintenance, administrative and accounting manager for each of the German companies (GmbH & Co. KG) making claims 1\u201365, and was the operator of the PV plants held by each of those companies. Claim 66 is made in respect of bonus payments payable under the O&M (operation and maintenance) contracts \u2013 it is one of the 'contractual claims'. As was explained in the Memorial:\n\n*Claimant DSG GmbH, which today is owned by Claimants Joachim Kruck and Peter Flachsmann, entered into O&M contracts with each of the Spanish investment companies holding the PV facilities in Projects Alcolea, Calasparra, and Tordesillas. In addition to its regular fees under the contracts, in exchange for its services, DSG GmbH received a bonus payment of 10% of defined \"excess proceeds\" received by Project Alcolea and 50% of the \"excess proceeds\" received by Projects Calasparra and Tordesillas. In the contracts, the term \"excess proceeds\" is defined as the amount exceeding forecasts for the production of electricity multiplied by the applicable RD 661/2007 fixed tariff. Thus, DSG GmbH owns interests related to the performance of the plants, based on the RD 661/2007 tariff rates.*104\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 30 (footnotes omitted).\n\n88.\n\nThe characterization of this arrangement as an \"investment\" is more problematic. DSG GmbH's contingent entitlement to a bonus was certainly dependent in part upon the work and skill with which it acted in fulfilment of its contractual obligations to operate and maintain the plants. But the interest of DSG GmbH is a contingent contractual entitlement on the part of one German claimant as against each of the 65 claimant German companies holding the PV plants arising from the possibility of generating 'excess' production, and as such it may be doubted whether it counts as an 'investment' for the purposes of the ECT. It is essentially a mechanism for sharing the benefits and risks of each project between DSG GmbH and the limited partners in the GmbH & Co. KGs holding the PV plants: if an amount were to be paid by a GmbH & Co. KG as a bonus to DSG GmbH that same amount would be lost to the GmbH & Co. KG; and conversely, unless the GmbH & Co. KG received \"excess proceeds\" in the first place, DSG GmbH would have had no entitlement to a share of them.\n\n89.\n\nFor that reason any losses of a GmbH & Co. KG's monies that would have been used to fulfil DSG GmbH's contractual bonuses may be viewed as elements of the losses sustained by each GmbH & Co. KG. It follows that any such losses, flowing from unlawful harm allegedly caused to each GmbH & Co. KG \u2013 each of Claimants 1\u201365 \u2013 can be regarded as the results of harm done investments of investors over whom the Tribunal undoubtedly has jurisdiction. Accordingly, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal extends to any such losses.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants' third group of investments in respect of which compensation is claimed are the interests held by Mr. Joachim Kruck, Mr. Peter Flachsmann, Mr. Ralf Hofmann, Mr. Rolf Schumm, and Mr. Frank Schumm in the two Spanish companies that held the land on which the PV plants were located: Solar Andaluz Grundst\u00fccks S.L. and Deutsche Solar Ib\u00e9rica Real Estate SL. These interests are held by German citizens in Spanish companies that own or control land in Spain, and are undoubtedly within the definition of an investment in ECT Article 1(6) and within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n91.\n\nIn addition to the Claimants in respect of these three groups of investments, there are two other DSG Claimants: (i) Claimant 67, DSG Spanien Verwaltungs GmbH ('DSG Spain'), and (ii) Claimant 68, Mr. Mathias Kruck. DSG Spain was the general partner in each of the German companies (GmbH & Co. KG) who are Claimants 1 to 65.105 Mr. Mathias Kruck purchased 50% of the shares in Claimant 23, Solarpark Calasparra 253 GmbH & Co. KG.106 No claim for compensation is made in respect of Claimants 67 and 68, because their losses would be compensated by awards made in respect of Claimants 1\u201365, and Claimant 23, respectively. There is, however, a request for declaratory relief in respect of the alleged breaches of the rights of all DSG Claimants, and it is therefore necessary to record that the Tribunal finds that Claimants 67 and 68 and their investments in the German companies, Claimants 1\u201365, holding the PV plants in Spain, are also within the definition of investments in ECT Article 1(6) and within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nCl.

SPHB, p. 8.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal returns below to the question whether alleged losses sustained in relation to these investments are recoverable.107 Here, the analysis continues by addressing the question of liability. It does so on the basis of the actual submissions of the Parties, most of which were made while both the DSG Investors and the TS Investors were claimants in the case. These include submissions which do not bear directly on the claims of the DSG Claimants alone, for example, because they focus on developments after the last of the DSG Claimants investments were made. Nonetheless, the submissions are summarized as they were made, in the interests of accuracy and because the Tribunal has in fact considered all submissions made by and on behalf of the Parties.\n\n*See* Sections VII and VIII below.\n\n**VII.

Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent has treated their investments unfairly and inequitably by altering and then repealing the incentives and commitments given to them under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2018.108 As a consequence, the Respondent has violated Article 10(1) of the ECT.109\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 64.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 393.\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to investors has been routinely applied by previous tribunals in accordance with the ECT's object and purpose. They summarize the ECT's object and purpose as \"strengthen[ing] the rule of law on energy issues\" and \"'catalyz[ing] economic growth' through investment and trade in energy and to establish 'a legal framework to promote long-term cooperation' between States and investors.\"110\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6 395.\n\n(i) Legitimate expectations\n---------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimants contend that it is the State's duty, as part of its fair and equitable treatment obligation, \"to ensure a stable legal and regulatory framework.\"115 This duty arises when the State has created \"'legitimate expectations' of such stability on the part of investors.\"116 When the State's acts have given rise to such legitimate expectations, that State has accepted limitations to its power to change the regulatory framework governing the investment of those investors.117 In addition to being recognized as a \"major component\" of the FET standard, the protection of legitimate expectations is also a general principle of law and has been consistently recognized by the Spanish Constitutional Court.118\n\nCl.

Express commitments contained in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008: The Claimants argue that RD 661/2007 clearly offered \"a stable pricing mechanism of tariff rates over the full operating life of a facility\" and RD 1578/2008 clearly stated that \"upon enrollment of a facility into the pre-allocation registry, Spain confirmed the specific tariff that would apply to the facility for twenty-five years.\"124 This legislation \"contained [\u2026] a right to the fixed tariffs for all of the electricity that Claimants' facilities produced and sold into the grid\" and \"established the incentives that would apply to the electricity that Claimants' facilities produced.\"125 It also confirmed that the State \"would adjust those rates annually for inflation, using the Consumer Price Index\" and that future revisions to the incentives \"would not alter the fixed tariffs already granted to existing facilities.\"126 Accordingly, the regulatory framework created by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 was stable and predictable;127\n\nb. \"[T]he *quid-pro-quo* required of PV producers for their plants to gain the rights in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008\": The Claimants' legitimate expectations were informed by this factor when they made the investments and took the steps necessary to qualify for the fixed tariffs;128\n\nc. Explicit authorization targeted to each of Claimants' investments: The Claimants argue that each plant received formal confirmation that it satisfied the requirements for enrolment in the RD 661/2007 regime and registration in the Administrative Registry for Special Regime Generation Facilities (\"**RAIPRE**\", sometimes known as \"**REPE**\")129, in accordance with RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008;130\n\nd. The context in which Spain enacted RD 661/2007 and RD 158/2008: The Claimants contend that between 1994 and 2004, none of the schemes introduced by Spain to foster investment in the renewable energy market contained fixed tariff rates or promises regarding future changes to such tariff rates. As a result of intense lobbying by industry associations, explicit provisions regarding the non-retroactivity of future revisions to the tariff rates were included in RD 436/2004. All these provisions were maintained in RD 661/2007, which also granted more stability by the introduction of specific and fixed tariff rates (as opposed to the formula introduced in RD 436/2004);131\n\ne. The well-known purposes and basic logic of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008: Spain needed to meet its binding EU targets for renewable energy and to reduce its dependence on non-renewable and foreign energy sources. With this in mind, Spain designed RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 to encourage investors to act quickly by offering them, for a limited time, incentives that would remain stable;132\n\nf. The manner in which RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 addressed the concerns from PV investors: Spain was aware of the significant upfront costs associated with the construction of PV plants, and that both investors and lenders needed assurances that the costs were going to be recovered and that they would make a profit. Spain designed RD 611/2007 and RD 1578/2008 to address such concerns;133\n\ng. Clear and repeated statements and conduct of Spanish officials: The Claimants maintain that high-ranking officials repeatedly made explicit promises to investors that the framework contained in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would remain constant throughout the operating lives of the PV facilities.134 This included statements from the Council of Ministers,135 two successive Ministers in charge of Energy,136 the CNE,137 and the Secretary of Energy.138 The Claimants also refer to several presentations, including by an agency created by Spain, Invest in Spain, to attract foreign investment by promoting RD 661/2007;139\n\nh. Legal advice from multiple law firms and the fact that international banks were willing to provide non-recourse financing on favourable terms due to the predictable cash flows the regimes guaranteed: The Claimants argue that Spain's promises, guarantees and aggressive promotion also sought to assure Europe's financial community, the main source of financing for the projects, of the stability and security of the legal framework for renewable energy.140\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 435-436.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Spain's measures were not adopted in good faith because:\n\na. Spain was able to derive the complete benefit from the Claimants' PV plants and from the energy capacity that they created, while denying the Claimants the benefits that it had originally promised to offer and upon which the Claimants relied when making their investments. In addition, Spain started going back on its promises at a time when it was no longer economically feasible for the Claimants to relocate their plants;166\n\nb. The measures adopted by Spain unfairly targeted the Claimants and other renewable energy investors as the alleged cause of Spain's tariff deficit, when the real cause of the deficit was Spain's own failure to address the deficit issue from the outset and pass on costs to the consumers.167 The Respondent forced the renewable energy investors \"to bear the burden of the 'solution'\" that should have also been borne by traditional energy producers, utilities, and end-consumers;168\n\nc. The introduction of the purported 7% \"tax\" \"was particularly disingenuous and unfair\" because \"it does not act as a *bona fide* 'tax' at all, creates a disproportionate impact on renewable energy investors, and directly reduces the tariffs Spain granted to Claimants' facilities.\"169\n\nCl.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1038-1048.\n\n121.\n\n*First,* the Respondent argues that the ECT distinguishes between: ***(a)*** the period of the \"'making-investment process' [\u2026] in which the conditions for guaranteeing the objective of national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment were reserved for the signing of a 'supplementary treaty', that has still not been signed\";176 and ***(b)*** the period after the investment has been made, when \"the guarantee of national treatment and the most favoured nation clause are applied to the foreign investor, albeit with certain limitations [\u2026]\"177 by the ECT, including ECT Article 10.\n\nResp.

There being no such treaty, the obligation of national treatment cannot apply in the case at hand because, according to the Respondent, the Claimants are requesting (in effect) the payment of subsidies or State aid for the production of electrical energy, contrary to EU law.181 The Respondent maintains that its view is also supported by Article 9 of the ECT and positions taken by the ECT Secretariat.182\n\nResp.

According to the Respondent, no diligent and informed investor would have expected the framework to be petrified simply because the investor had fulfilled the regulatory requirement of registration with the RAIPRE.211 In addition, the Claimants have not provided conclusive proof that Spain agreed not to make future reforms that could affect the PV plants in operation.212 A diligent and informed investor would have been aware of the existing regulatory risk, which had been recognized by the main associations in the renewable energy sector and the Spanish Supreme Court.213\n\nResp.

Such an obligation would violate the Spanish Constitution and the principle of hierarchy of norms. In the eyes of the Respondent, therefore, no Royal Decree can give rise to legitimate expectations.219\n\nResp.

The contracts entered into by the Claimants show that they knew and assumed the regulatory risk, as illustrated by the Claimants' loan agreements and investment prospectuses;\n\nb. The Claimants did not participate in any specific negotiations or agreements so that general regulations are applicable to them;\n\nc. No exhaustive due diligence process regarding the operation of the Spanish regulatory framework was conducted;\n\nd. The Respondent's regulatory framework and case-law do not admit the Claimants' position;\n\ne.

With respect to the particular presentations and statements submitted by the Claimants, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have not provided any evidence that they had any knowledge of them,224 and, in any case, these could not create objective expectations because:225\n\na. generic statements and parliamentary debates cannot create expectations of an immutable regime, ignoring the evolution of the applicable regulations and case-law;226\n\nb. as accepted by both Parties, the CNE's duties do not include organising promotional campaigns for foreign investors. The presentations referred to by the Claimants in support of their case are part of courses given to CNE staff, which were not targeted at foreign investors. In any event, the Supreme Court ratified the legality of the measures adopted on the basis of its case-law which the CNE cited in its report on RD 661/2007;227 and\n\nc. the presentations and brochures by IDEA and InvestSpain submitted by the Claimants do not guarantee that the tariffs cannot be modified and, when they refer to the applicable regulatory framework, they link RD 661/2007 to Act 54/1997 and the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010.228\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 1157.\n\n148.\n\n*First*, the Respondent contends that the awards referred to by the Claimants in support of its position are of no relevance. The tribunals in these awards, except for one, do not apply the ECT; and the only award in which the tribunal does apply the ECT does not include a ruling on the lack of transparency.242\n\nResp.

Further, Spain has announced since 2009 the need to reform the SES due to the international crisis unfolding at the time.247 Moreover, the Claimants were aware since the 2005 Supreme Court judgments, and even more so since the 2012 judgments,248 that it was possible, if not probable, that the regulatory framework would change.249 In fact, the reforms adopted were neither unexpected nor lacking in transparency; they followed the applicable procedures without delays and guaranteed the participation of all the affected agents.250 The CNE, associations of renewable energy producers, investors, consultants, and law firms all knew of the possibility that the regulatory framework would change.251\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1156-1157.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***a. The relevant provisions of the ECT***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe first sentence of ECT Article 10 provides that\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.*\n\n154.\n\nWhile that provision sets out obligations, albeit in very vague terms, they are obligations of a general nature that appear from the words of the provision to be directed primarily at creating the conditions in which investments will be made \u2013 that is, conditions subsisting in what the Respondent referred to as the \"*making-investment*\" phase and the title of ECT Article 10 refers to as the phase of 'promotion' of investments, as opposed to the phase that begins once the investment is made.\n\n155.\n\nThe remaining sentences of ECT Article 10(1) begin with a commitment to accord fair and equitable treatment \"at all times\" to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties, and then proceed to set out the content of the \"stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions\" to which ECT Contracting Parties are committed. They read as follows:\n\n*Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.*\n\n156.\n\nThese sentences do not refer expressly to legitimate expectations, transparency, or good faith; and the Tribunal shares the view that those three concepts are not independent standards of treatment secured by ECT Article 10 but are non-exhaustive examples of the manner in which the obligations that are expressly set out in Article 10 might be breached. The Tribunal does not accept that the Respondent's contention that \"[t]he maximum aspiration of the ECT is ... national treatment\",256 which cannot be reconciled with the explicit terms of Article 10(1) and the structure of Article 10 as a whole.\n\n*See* \u00b6 122 above.\n\n157.\n\nECT Article 10(1) establishes a distinction between the right to fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") and the rights (such as the right to \"most constant protection and security\") which, according to the next sentence in Article 10(1), \"Investments shall also enjoy\" (emphasis added). In the circumstances of the present case, however, the Tribunal is satisfied that it makes no material difference to questions of liability or quantum whether the alleged breaches of the ECT are analyzed as potential breaches of the FET obligation or of other obligations resulting from ECT Article 10.\n\n***b. The main issue concerning FET***\n--------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe main disagreement between the Parties as to the content of the FET standard, which bears directly upon the application of the standard in the context of the doctrine of legitimate expectations, concerns its implications for the scope of the regulatory power of the State. The Respondent, citing the *Saluka* and *Philip Morris* Awards, maintains (i) that the FET standard requires a balancing exercise, with the Claimants bearing the burden of proving the alleged breaches, and (ii) that there will never be a breach of the FET standard if the host State exercises in a reasonable manner its regulatory power in pursuance of a public interest.257 The Claimants maintain that the Respondent's formulation of its right to regulate is 'grossly overstated'.258\n\nE.g., Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 200; *citing* Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 305-309 (RL-0107); Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl and others v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016, \u00b6 423 (RL-0106).\n\nE.g., Claimants' Closing Statement, slides 22-25.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal does not disagree with the descriptions of the FET standard in cases such as *Philip Morris*: but they must be read in context. Thus, paragraph 423 of the *Philip Morris* Award, quoted by the Respondent, must be read in the light of paragraphs 422\u2013426 of that Award. That section of the *Philip Morris* Award reads as follows:\n\n*422. It is common ground in the decisions of more recent investment tribunals that the requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State's rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to changing circumstances.*259\n\n*423. On this basis, changes to general legislation (at least in the absence of a stabilization clause) are not prevented by the fair and equitable treatment standard if they do not exceed the exercise of the host State's normal regulatory power in the pursuance of a public interest and do not modify the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor at the time of its investment \"outside of the acceptable margin of change.\"*\n\n*424. The Tribunal in EDF v. Romania has stated in that regard:*\n\n*\"The idea that legitimate expectations, and therefore FET, imply the stability of the legal and business framework, may not be correct if stated in an overly-broad and unqualified formulation. The FET might then mean the virtual freezing of the legal regulation of economic activities, in contrast with the State's normal regulatory power and the evolutionary character of economic life. Except where specific promises or representation are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State's legal and economic framework. Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable.\"*260\n\n*425. A similar view has been expressed by the tribunal in El Paso v. Argentina:*\n\n*\"There can be no legitimate expectation for anyone that the legal framework will remain unchanged in the face of an extremely severe economic crisis. No reasonable investor can have such an expectation unless very specific commitments have been made towards it or unless the alteration of the legal framework is total.*\n\n*Under a FET clause, a foreign investor can expect that the rules will not be changed without justification of an economic, social or other nature. Conversely, it is unthinkable that a State could make a general commitment to all foreign investors never to change its legislation whatever the circumstances, and it would be unreasonable for an investor to rely on such a freeze.\"*261\n\n*426. It clearly emerges from the analysis of the FET standard by investment tribunals that legitimate expectations depend on specific undertakings and representations made by the host State to induce investors to make an investment. Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or of category of persons, do not create legitimate expectations that there will be no change in the law.\"*262\n\n*Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl and others v.

Did the Respondent make representations upon which the Claimants were entitled to rely?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimants set out a list of the specific representations upon which each of the DSG Claimants relies in presenting their claims. It is headed \"Claimants' Reliance on Specific Representations Made by (a) Respondent and (b) Any Other Person\" (\"**Claimants' Reliance**\"), and was included in their Post-Hearing Brief in response to a question posed by the Tribunal.\n\n163.\n\nNot all of the representations relied upon can be taken into account. Representations by third parties, not acting on behalf of or under the direction or control of the Respondent, cannot themselves actually create obligations for the Respondent on which the Claimants were entitled to rely. That is an elementary principle of international law.263\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, 2001 (\"ILC Articles on State Responsibility\"), Chapter II (RL-0095).\n\n164.\n\nFor that reason, the statements and advice of Ms. Mafalda Soto and Mr. Manuel Hermoso and Mr. Antonio Jim\u00e9nez and other lawyers and law firms, and material in the media and specialist publications, and the opinions of the banks264 and their legal advisors, and the experience and knowledge of individuals who had prior experience investing in Spain's PV industry, cannot form the foundation of a legitimate expectation that creates obligations binding on the Respondent.265 Their statements and advice no doubt communicated and explained the Spanish regulatory regime and the statements made by the Respondent in the way that (as governments are fully aware) these matters are ordinarily explained to investors by professional advisers: but the statements and advice of advisors cannot add to or alter whatever representations are made by the Respondent itself in its public measures and statements. They are also relevant to the question of due diligence.\n\nNotably the bank now known as Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (\"**LBBW**\"), and DZ Bank AG.\n\nThe references to the locations of the relevant passages in the pleadings and the transcript are set out in the list at Cl. PHB, \u00b6 56, pp. 22-30, and will not be reproduced here.\n\n165.\n\nWhen these 'secondary sources' of statements are excluded, the table of 'Claimants' Reliance' rests on the following representations made by or attributable to the Respondent: (i) the text of RD 661/2007, which was enacted on 25 May 2007; (ii) the text of RD 1578/2008, adopted on 26 September 2008; (iii) the RAIPRE registration process, pursuant to RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, and \"Spain's pre-allocation registry for plants seeking to obtain registration under RD 1578\"; and (iv) \"Spain's promotional efforts discussing the stability of its incentive regime\" and \"announcements of the Spanish Government regarding RD 661.\"266\n\nThe Tribunal has taken into account the Claimants' assertions concerning statements on which they relied and which they took into consideration, wherever in the record of this case those assertions appear, in accordance with Cl. PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n166.\n\nIt is convenient to consider those sources of alleged representations in a broadly chronological order.\n\n(i) The text of RD 661/2007\n---------------------------\n\n167.\n\nIt is appropriate to begin by stating clearly that the Tribunal does not consider that a statement in a piece of legislation that a particular legal framework will last for a specified time is in every case necessarily sufficient in itself to amount to a binding commitment by the State not to amend that framework within the specified time. Quite apart from minor amendments that may be determined to be compatible with any duty to maintain the original framework, it must always be recognized that circumstances, and governments, change, and that the presumption is that a State is always free to amend its legislation in accordance with its constitutional procedures. The mere fact that a regulatory regime is set out in legislation does not imply that it will not be changed: it is necessary to point to something that clearly indicates that the State is making a commitment not to exercise its legislative power in a particular way.\n\n168.\n\nThe context in which RD 661/2007 was enacted is relevant to the understanding of its provisions. It is evident that RD 661/2007 was adopted with the intention of attracting investment in renewable energy in Spain, thus enabling Spain to achieve its targets for renewable energy, and that the stability of the regime was understood prior to the adoption of RD 661/2007, to be a crucial *desideratum* in the new regime. For example, on 14 February 2007, the CNE published Report 3/2007 on a draft of what later became RD 661/2007, in which it criticised the shortcomings of the then-current draft and drew attention to the need to minimize the uncertainty of the regulatory regime:\n\n***Minimize regulatory uncertainty.*** *The NEC understands that transparency and predictability in the future of economic incentives reduces regulatory uncertainty, incentivising investments in new capacity and minimizing the cost of financing projects, thus reducing the final cost to the consumer. The regulation must offer sufficient guarantees to ensure that the economic incentives are stable and predictable throughout the service life of the facility. In each case, regulation must provide both transparent annual adjustment mechanisms, associated to robust trend indexes (such as the average or reference tariff, the CPI, ten-year bonds, etc.) and regular reviews that only affect new facilities (e.g. every four years) with regard to investment costs, which could also affect the reduction of operating costs at existing facilities.*267\n\nCNE Report 3/2007, p. 16 (R-0116).\n\n169.\n\nThe Report also noted that\n\n*As shown both in the scientific doctrine and case law, in a social and democratic State of Law the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations cannot be built on insurmountable obstacles to the innovation of a body of law, nor can they be used as instruments to petrify current Law at any moment. In other words, the principle of legal certainty is not by definition an anti-evolutionary or conservative principle; it does not mean that legislation is resistant or immune to reform. In this sense, these principles do not impede dynamic innovation, nor that new regulatory provisions be applied retroactively to existing situations, but that they should continue upon entry into force of the new regulations (this is \"improper\" retroactivity). Thus the principles only require that regulatory innovation\u2014especially if sudden, unpredictable or unexpected\u2014be carried out with certain guarantees and caution (sufficient transition periods for adaptation and, where applicable, compensatory measures) that cushion, moderate and minimise as far as possible the defrauding of expectations generated by previous regulations.*268\n\nCNE Report 3/2007, p. 18; (R-0116).\n\n170.\n\nIt accordingly recorded the view of the CNE Managing Board that \"the draft Royal Decree subject to this report: (a) Should enter into force on 1 January 2008; and (b) Pursuant to Article 40 of Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, the draft Royal Decree subject to analysis and report should not apply to facilities operating on 1 January 2008.\"269\n\nCNE Report 3/2007, pp.19-20, and cf. pp. 57, 61 (R-0116).\n\n171.\n\nThe reasoning behind this view was explained in terms that cast some light on the kind of stability which the CNE was recommending should be adopted in the planned Royal Decree:\n\n*The production facilities in the special regime [are] capital-intensive and have long recovery periods. Royal Decree 436/2004 minimises the regulatory risk by granting stability and predictability to the economic incentives during the service life of the facilities. This is done by establishing a transparent annual adjustment mechanism, associating incentives to trends in a robust index such as the average or reference tariff (TMR), and by exempting existing facilities from the four-year review because only new incentives affect new facilities.*\n\n*The developers who have invested in special regime production facilities during the validity of Royal Decree 436/2004 have done so in stable regulatory conditions, fundamentally based on a secure and predictable regulated tariff during the entire service life of the facility. The guarantees covered in Royal Decree 436/2004 have allowed cheaper financing, with lower project costs and a lower impact on the electricity tariff ultimately paid by the consumer.*270\n\nCNE Report 3/2007, pp.23-24 (R-0116).\n\n172.\n\nThe CNE recommendations resulted in some amendments to the then-current draft, before it was enacted as RD 661/2007. For instance, the draft plan for a four-yearly review of tariffs applicable to new and existing facilities was amended to provide, in what became Article 44.3 (quoted below), that tariff revisions would not affect existing facilities.271\n\nClaimants' Opening Presentation, slide 45, quoting CNE Report 3/2007, section 4.d.10 (C-061).\n\n173.\n\nIn RD 661/2007, as enacted, it is Articles 36 and 44 that are of particular importance. The Decree provides for the tariffs payable to facilities in various Categories, Groups, and Sub-groups of energy producers, PV plants being Sub-group b.1.1. in the Group b.1 (solar energy) of Category b (energy from renewable sources). Solar power facilities using thermal processes were in Sub-group b.1.2. The tariffs payable were set out in Article 36, which reads as follows:\n\n***Article 36.*** *Tariffs and premiums for facilities in Category b).*\n\n*The tariffs and premiums corresponding to facilities in Category b) shall be as provided in Table 3, below:*\n\n*For some Sub-Groups a different compensation is provided for the first few years from commissioning.*\n\n*Table 3*272\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Group** | **Subgroup** | **Power** | **Term** | **Regulated tariff c\u20ac/kWh** | **Reference premium c\u20ac/kWh** | **Upper limit c\u20ac/kWh** | **Lower limit c\u20ac/kWh** |\n| b.1 | b.1.1 | P \u2264100 kW | first 25 years | 44,0381 |  |  |  |\n| thereafter | 35,2305 |\n| 100 kW first 25 years | 41,7500 | |\n| thereafter | 33,4000 |\n| 10 first 25 years | 22,9764 | |\n| thereafter | 18,3811 |\n\nRD 661/2007, Article 36, Table 3: (C-098 (improved)). The information in the \"term\" column, which appears in Spanish in the English version, has been translated by the Tribunal. The last three columns are blank because PV facilities did not have the option of choosing a 'market rate + premium' scheme rather than a fixed tariff scheme.\n\n174.\n\nArticle 44 reads, so far as is material, as follows:\n\n*Article 44. Updating and review of tariffs, premiums, and supplements*\n\n*1.* [\u2026]\n\n*The values of the tariffs, premiums, supplements, and lower and upper limits to the hourly price of the market as defined in this Royal Decree, for Category b) and Sub-Group a.1.3, shall be updated on an annual basis using as a reference the increase in the RPI less the value set out in the Additional Provision One of the present Royal Decree.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*2. The values of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits to the hourly price of the market which derive from any of the updates covered in the preceding point shall be applicable to all of the facilities in each group, regardless of the date of commissioning of each facility.*\n\n*3. During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010, and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.*\n\n*The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.*\n\n*4. The National Energy Commission is hereby authorised to set out the definition of the technologies and standard facilities, in a Circular, and to gather information on the investments, costs, revenues, and other parameters of the various different actual facilities which make up the standard technologies.*273\n\nRD 661/2007, Article 44 (C-098 (improved)).\n\n175.\n\nThose provisions should be read in the context of the Preamble to RD 661/2007. It includes the following paragraphs:\n\n[\u2026]*The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime a reasonable return on their investments, and the consumers of electricity an assignment of the costs attributable to the electricity system which is also reasonable, although incentives are provided to playing a part in this market since it is considered that in this manner lower government intervention will be achieved in the setting of prices, together with better, more efficient, attribution of the costs of the system, particularly in respect of the handling of diversions and the provisions of supplementary services.*\n\n*To this effect, a system which is analogous to that provided in Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, is maintained, in which the owner of the facility may opt to sell their energy at a regulated tariff, which will be the same for all scheduling periods, or alternatively*274 *to sell this energy directly on the daily market, the term market, or through a bilateral contract, in this case receiving the price negotiated in the market plus a premium. In this latter case, an innovation is introduced for certain technologies, namely upper and lower limits for the sum of the hourly price in the daily market, plus a reference premium, such that the premium to be received for each hour may be limited in accordance with these values. This new system protects the promoter when the revenue*[] *deriving from the market price falls excessively low, and eliminates the premium when the market price is sufficiently high to guarantee that their costs will be covered, thus eliminating irrationalities in the payment for the technologies the costs of which are not directly related to the prices of petroleum in the international markets.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*As a consequence of the repeal of the costs of transition to competition (CTCs), implemented by Royal Decree-Law 7/2006, of 23 June, the premium for certain facilities in Category a) under Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, were removed prior to the initially expected date of 2010. In order to mitigate this unfair impact upon facilities whose activity was not directly linked to those costs, as from the entry into effect of the cited Royal Decree-Law until the entry into force of the present Royal Decree, the value of the incentive of such facilities is increased by the sum of the premium lost, such that the total payment shall remain exactly equal to that in the situation prior to the amendment.*\n\nThe alternatives were not open to PV producers. Their only option was to accept the regulated tariff.\n\n176.\n\nThe Spanish Government made several public statements explaining the significance of RD 661/2007, which are also relevant to understanding its provisions. On the day that the Decree was enacted, the Government issued a press release, which is worthy of quotation at some length:\n\n*This Royal Decree sets out to improve the remuneration for less mature technologies such as biomass and solar thermal, thereby being able to achieve the targets of the Renewable Energies Plan 2005-2010 as well as the targets assumed by Spain at the EU level. With the development of these new technologies, renewable energy in Spain will cover 12% of energy consumption in 2010. The new regulation ensures a 7% return for wind and hydroelectric installations that opt to assign their production to the distributors and between 5% and 9% if they take part in the electrical energy production market. The highest power photovoltaic installations practically double their remuneration, being maintained for smaller ones and the guarantee of obtaining a return of 7%. In those technologies that need to be advanced owing to their limited development, such as biomass, biogas, or solar thermoelectric, the return stands at 8% under the option involving assignment to the distributors and between 7% and 11% by taking part in the market. Every 4 years the tariffs will be revised, bearing in mind compliance with the targets set. This will allow an adjustment to the tariffs in line with the new costs and the degree of compliance with the targets. The tariff revisions carried out in the future will not affect those installations already operating. This guarantee affords legal safety to the producer, providing stability to the sector and promoting its development. The new regulations will not be of a retroactive nature. The installations operating before January 1, 2008 may continue to adopt the previous regulations under the fixed tariff option throughout their working life* [\u2026]\n\n*The establishment of a stable subsidy system that ensures an attractive return on electrical energy production activity under a special regime is the aim of the new Royal Decree approved today by the Cabinet to regulate in the forthcoming years the legal and economic regime pertaining to installations that generate electrical energy from cogeneration and those that deploy renewable energies and waste as their raw materials.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Outlines of the new Royal Decree*\n\n*The new regulations determine the right to receive special remuneration for the energy produced at the installations included under the special regime, in other words, with power of less than 50 MW, and also those which have power in excess of 50 MW, i.e., cogeneration, those that use renewable energies, or waste.*\n\n*The new regulations will not be of a retroactive nature. The installations that are operational by January 1, 2008 may continue to adopt the previous regulations under the fixed tariff option throughout their operating life. When they take part in the market, they may maintain their prior regulation until December 31, 2012. These installations may voluntarily opt to abide by this new Royal Decree as from its publication.*\n\n*It will be in 2010 that the tariffs and premiums set out in the proposal will be revised in accordance with the targets set in the Renewable Energies Plan 2005-2010 and in the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy and in line with the new targets included in the following Renewable Energies Plan for the period 2011-2020.*\n\n*The revisions carried out in the future of the tariffs will not affect those Installations already in operation. This guarantee provides legal safety for the producer, affording stability to the sector and fostering its development.*\n\n*Renewable Energies*\n\n*Return*\n\n*As far as the return is concerned, the new regulation ensures a mean percentage of 7% for a wind and hydroelectric installation in the event of opting to assign their production to the distributors and a return of between 5% and 9% if it takes part in the production market.*\n\n*For other technologies that need to be advanced owing to their limited development, such as biomass, biogas, or solar thermoelectric, the return stands at 8% for the assignment of production to distributors and between 7 and 11% if they take part in the market.*\n\n*Increase in remuneration*\n\n*The anticipated increase for the remuneration of biomass varies between 50% and 100%, for biogas between 16% and 40%, and for solar thermoelectric 17%.*\n\n*With the sale to the distributor option, remuneration is increased for wind energy, biomass, solar thermoelectric, and photovoltaic installations whose power is greater than 100 kW and the remuneration is maintained for photovoltaic solar plants whose power is less than that stated.*\n\n*Hence, any increases in the feed-in tariff with regard to that stated in Royal Decree 436/2004 are 12% for wind installations, between 7% and 13% for hydroelectric installations, 17% for thermoelectric installations, 82% for photovoltaic installations greater than 100 kW, between 56 and 113% for biomass installations (except for forest industrial waste which increases by 6%) and 16 and 40% for biogas installations.*\n\n*When the installations opt to take part in the production market, the premium obtained will be variable in line with the resulting market price at any time. With this in mind, lower and upper limits are established for each of the technologies that are known as \"cap and floor.\" Under this system, the premium will be adjusted in such a way that the total remuneration that a[n] installation will obtain will be situated between these limits at all times.*\n\n*The tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits, as well as other complements, will be updated according to the IPC (retail price index) minus 0.25 until 2012 or minus 0.50 from that time onwards.\"*275\n\nPress Release for RD 661/2007 (C-099).\n\n177.\n\nIt should be recalled that this framework was a limited offer. Under Article 22.1, the scheme in RD 661/2007 was to be reviewed once 85% of the target set by the Spanish Government for each technology (371 MW for PV plants) had been reached, after which a 'sunset' period of not less than 12 months could be announced, at the close of which no further entitlements to regulated tariffs under this new regime for PV plants could arise.276\n\n*See* \u00b6 40 above; RD 661/2007, Articles 22, 37 (C-098).\n\n178.\n\nThat 85% threshold was reached by September 2007. On 27 September 2007, Spain announced that the scheme would close to new investments on 29 September 2008, by which date new PV facilities must have obtained their final registration if they were to be entitled to regulated tariffs under RD 661/2007.277 On 26 September 2008, RD 1578/2008 was enacted to modify and extend the period of application of certain provisions of RD 661/2007, for PV facilities completed after the 29 September 2008 deadline.\n\n*See* Cl. Mem., \u00b6 211.\n\n(ii) The text of RD 1578/2008\n-----------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe PV facilities in which the DSG Investors invested were registered under RD 661/2007,278 and it is representations in and relating to RD 661/2007 that are material to any legitimate expectations concerning those facilities. However, the DSG Claimants' claims include later investment transactions in relation to those facilities, of which the latest is the purchase by Mr. Joachim Kruck of 43% of Claimant 57, Solarpark Tordesillas 422 GmbH & Co. KG, on 5 May 2009.279 Representations in and relating to RD 1578/2008 are therefore potentially relevant to the DSG claims.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 14.\n\nArticles of Incorporation of Solarpark Tordesillas 422 GmbH & Co. KG, 5 May 2009 (C-191).\n\n180.\n\nRD 1578/2008 introduced several significant modifications to the scheme as it had operated under RD 661/2007 (and continued to operate alongside and as modified by RD 1578/2008). First, grouping PV facilities into (I) roof-top installations (1) up to 20kW and (2) over 20kW, and (II) other (i.e., ground-mounted) facilities, it provided for the setting of an annual quota for each type and sub-type for the amount of electricity eligible for the regulated tariff.280 Eligibility was to be established by entry of a PV facility first on a \"compensation pre-assignment registry\"281 and then, after the meeting of certain conditions, on the Register that evidenced the entitlement to receive the regulated tariffs.\n\nRD 1578/2008, Articles 3, 5 (R-0087).\n\nRD 1578/2008, Articles 4-8 (R-0087).\n\n181.\n\nSecond, RD 1578/2008 offered lower regulated tariffs282 and provided for adjustments in the tariff rates each quarter, with tariffs being increased if the quotas were not being met and decreased if they were being exceeded (all within limits), in accordance with a formula set out in the Decree.283 The scheme was explained in a Press Release that accompanied the adoption of RD 1578/2008:\n\n*The new remuneration is 32 cents/KWh for ground and \u20ac32 cents and \u20ac34 cents/KWh for roof (greater and less than 20 KW, respectively). This remuneration will be lowered every quarter in line with the using up of the quotas.*\n\n*It determines a \"pre-registration\" mechanism in such a way that once certain administrative procedures have been carried out (administrative authorization, connection etc.), the projects are entered on a register at which time they are assigned a feed-in tariff which they will receive once this installation has been completed.*\n\n*The installations may not be any bigger than 10 MW on the ground and 2 MW in buildings.*\n\n*The \"pre-registration\" will have four annual convenings.*\n\n*The feed-in tariff for each convening will be calculated in line with the demand set out in the previous convening, lowering the remuneration if the complete quota is covered. The tariff may also be raised if in two consecutive convenings 50% of the quota is not attained.*\n\n*The reductions may be of up to 10% per annum.*\n\n*This remuneration scheme benefits consumers by setting a remuneration which is adjusted to the learning curve of the technology which will result in a cheaper electricity cost compared with the model in force. It also benefits investors by affording the predictability of future remunerations.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The annual quotas will be increased by the same percentage rate as the remuneration is reduced by during the same period, up to 10%.*284\n\nRD 1578/2008, Article 11 (R-0087). The initial (2009) quota for all types of PV facility was 400MW, with two-thirds available for roof-top installations and one-third for ground-based facilities.\n\nRD 1578/2008, Articles 5, 11 (R-0087).\n\nPress Release for RD 1578/2008 (C-138 (improved)).\n\n182.\n\nFurther, it was provided that \"[d]uring the year 2012, based on the technological evolution of the sector and the market, and the functioning of the compensatory regime, compensation for the generation of electric power by photovoltaic solar technology may be modified.\"285 Moreover, it was provided that \"[t]he Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce shall be authorized to issue any rules or regulations necessary for expanding on this royal degree and to modify the contents of the appendices thereto if the development of this technology or the functioning of the preassignment of compensation makes a such [sic] advisable.\"286\n\nRD 1578/2008, Fifth additional provision. Modification of the compensation for generation by photovoltaic technology (R-0087).\n\nRD 1578/2008, Second final provision. Regulatory development and modifications of the content of the appendices (R-0087).\n\n183.\n\nThird, the time during which the regulated tariffs were to be available was limited to \"a maximum period of twenty-five years.\"287 The Press Release accompanying RD 1578/2008 gave a slightly different impression. It stated that \"[t]he remuneration period for each facility is 25 years and the annual updating of the remuneration [is] in line with the IPC-0.25 or 0.50, in both cases the same as in the previous Royal Decree.\"288 The unequivocal wording of the Decree itself must, however, be given priority.\n\nRD 1578/2008, Article 11(5) (R-0087).\n\nPress Release for RD 1578/2008 (C-138 (improved)). The \"IPC\" is the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\") applicable under RD 661/2007.\n\n184.\n\nIn these respects, RD 1578/2008 established a regime for PV facilities that was broadly comparable to that under RD 661/2007 but less advantageous in important respects. The most material point, however, is that RD 1578/2008 specifically provided, in Article 2, that\n\n*This royal decree shall apply to the facilities included in Group b.1.1 of Article 2 of Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007, photovoltaic technology facilities, that obtain their permanent registration in the Administrative Registry of generation facilities under a special regime, a division of the Energy and Mining Policy Department, after September 29, 2008.*289\n\nRD 1578/2008, Article 2 (R-0087).\n\n185.\n\nThus, RD 1578/2008 stipulated that it did not apply to PV facilities registered on or before 29 September 2008, under RD 661/2007, and therefore did not alter the regulatory provisions applicable to them. Nor is it alleged that any other regulatory changes made before the DSG Claimants' final investment affected the PV facilities registered under RD 661/2007.\n\n(iii) The RAIPRE Registration Process and Spain's Pre-Allocation Registry for Plants Seeking to Obtain Registration Under RD 1578/2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe formality of registration of PV facilities under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 was undoubtedly a matter of great importance to investors.290 Failure to complete the necessary formalities and to meet the deadlines for registration would have precluded a facility from benefiting from the regulated tariffs for which the Special Regime provided. The Tribunal does not, however, consider that in terms of the representations contained in the texts of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 the registration requirement adds a significantly different dimension to the other provisions of those Decrees. While the formality of registration might give greater weight to a commitment made in the Decree, it could not convert a provision that entailed no commitment into one that did, given registration was essentially an administrative mechanism for identifying the facilities entitled to the benefit of the regime established by the Decree and for monitoring and keeping some control over activity under the Special Regime.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., Flachsmann WS, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n(iv) Spain's promotional efforts and announcements of the Spanish Government regarding RD 661/2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nReference has already been made to the CNE Report 3/2007, and to the Press Releases that accompanied RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. The Claimants point to a number of other statements by Spanish Government members and officials, made in 2007, which asserted that RD 661/2007 provided \"legal certainty for investors, to know what to expect\" and that the Spanish Government had \"publicly said already what we will do from now on.\"291 Similarly, Spain's Secretary of Energy is quoted as saying that RD 661/2007 would provide \"total legal certainty.\"292 The Claimants also say that similar statements were made, including by the CNE Director of Electricity, in the course of promotional presentations of Spain's new regulatory system.293 Such statements appear to have been broad affirmations or confirmations of the policy set out in RD 661/2007, but there is no suggestion that they added to the scope of any commitments that it embodied or that they added materially to the strength of any such commitments.\n\nCl.

The same idea is expressed in the requirement that other tribunals have identified for a \"specific commitment\" given directly to an investor.295\n\n*See* \u00b6 159 above.\n\nFollowing the language of the *El Paso* tribunal. *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 375-379 (CL-053).\n\n189.\n\nAt least in circumstances where the explicitly declared purpose of legislation is to invite investors to commit capital to projects in reliance upon guarantees of stability in a regulatory regime, specific commitments can be made by provisions in general legislation. This is particularly the case in circumstances where, as here, the great majority of capital costs in an investment are incurred right at the beginning of the project and are to be recouped over the operating lifetime of the project. The Tribunal, by majority, finds that to be the case here: it is the enactment of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 that gave rise to the possibility of legitimate expectations upon which potential DSG investors could rely.\n\n190.\n\nConsidering the express language of RD 661/2007, and bearing in mind the written and oral submissions of the Parties, the Tribunal, by a majority, concludes that RD 661/2007 was indeed intended to induce investments in the renewable energy sector by promising attractive and stable regulated tariffs and premiums, and that it constituted an invitation to potential investors to rely upon that promise. RD 661/2007 contained express assurances that its fixed tariffs would apply to qualifying, registered PV facilities for a fixed period, and that changes to the regulatory regime would not apply to facilities already registered. In press releases and presentations, RD 661/2007 was presented by Spain as doing so. RD 661/2007 was described in the Preamble to RD 1578/2008 as having established a new compensation framework \"for the purpose of achieving in 2010 the goals set in the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan and the Spanish Energy Savings and Efficiency Strategy\",296 after previous regulatory regimes had failed to attract the necessary investment. The Tribunal does not consider that RD 661/2007 could reasonably be understood to have guaranteed only that the tariff and premium regime would remain unchanged unless and until it was changed by law. Nor does it consider that references to a 'reasonable return' could be understood to have indicated that the precise tariffs and premiums specified in RD 661/2007 were merely temporary and variable instantiations of a 'reasonable return' which was the only true commitment made in that Decree. The precise tariffs and premiums no doubt represented what Spain considered reasonable at that time: but it was their stability that was the essential key to their intended effect in attracting investments.\n\nRD 1578/2008, Preamble (R-0087).\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached this conclusion on the basis of its reading of RD 661/2007, and other materials relating to that Decree. It does, however, consider that investors must undertake appropriate due diligence before relying on assurances and commitments of this kind. This need not involve detailed analysis by national or international experts in the relevant field. Part of the point of transparency, as enshrined in ECT Article 10(1) is that the regulatory regime should be accessible and intelligible, at least to lawyers qualified to practice in the jurisdiction, as was the attorney consulted by Mr. Joachim Kruck.297 The Tribunal notes that the bank (now part of Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemburg) that provided over \u20ac50 million in non-recourse loans to finance the PV projects itself relied upon an assurance from Ms. Mafalda Soto that the plants could qualify for the RD 661/2007 tariff.298\n\nFirst Kruck WS, \u00b6\u00b6 11-16.\n\nFirst Kruck WS, \u00b6 24.\n\n192.\n\nThe compensation framework in RD 661/2007 was intended to elicit investment; and it did so. Moreover, the importance of the stability of the compensation framework in attracting investment was plainly articulated, for instance in the CNE report 3/2007. The Tribunal considers that RD 661/2007 was intended to provide potential investors with an assurance concerning the stability of the framework. The statements concerning the 'legal certainty' provided by the framework, reinforcing the formality of the registration of eligible facilities, support this conclusion.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent's argument that legislation can always be amended, and that potential investors know that fact \u2013 or would be told by lawyers whom they consult \u2013and can therefore never rely upon regulatory provisions remaining unchanged, misses the point. No-one questions that Spain had the legal capacity to change the regulatory regime. The question is whether it was fair and equitable to do so in a manner that caused harm to certain investors who had relied on representations that Spain would not exercise that undoubted power in relation to their investments.\n\n194.\n\nThe less advantageous terms of RD 1578/2008 no doubt signalled that the days of fixed tariffs pitched at levels considered necessary to attract early investors into the construction of PV and other renewable electricity facilities were drawing to a close.299 It is, however, unnecessary to decide what, if any, commitments were made to potential investors in and regarding RD 1578/2008 because it did not apply to the DSG Claimants' investments. Indeed, the fact that RD 1578/2008 expressly had no application to those PV plants already registered under RD 661/2007 can only have supported the view that the stability of the regime established by RD 661/2007 was assured as far as registered facilities were concerned.\n\nCf., Cl. Reply, \u00b6 255.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that RD 661/2007 set out assurances on which it was intended that potential investors could and would rely, concerning the stability of the compensation framework established by RD 661/2007. This leads to the next question which is, given the making of these assurances, what constraints fell upon Spain as a result; or, in other words, what was the scope and content of Spain's commitment?\n\n***d. What were the constraints accepted by Spain as a result of that commitment?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent's position, that Spain's electricity laws were consistently based on the principle that producers should receive a 'reasonable return', and that there was no commitment by the State to anything more than a 'reasonable return', provides one interpretation of the documentary record. The Claimants put forward another: that there was indeed a commitment to a 'reasonable return' for producers and the 'reasonable return' was itself defined by the detailed compensation framework set out in RD 661/2007, so that the Claimants were entitled to (and did) rely upon the maintenance of that framework in all its detail.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the evidence, and notably the specificity of the compensation provisions in RD 661/2007 and the emphasis placed by Spain upon the 'legal certainty' produced by RD 661/2007, supports the Claimants' view. It accepts the interpretation of RD 661/2007 set out in the expert report by Professor Arag\u00f3n.300 A compensation framework in which detailed provisions for the payment of tariffs over a specific period of 25 years or more were set out explicitly and systematically, but subject to an implicit qualification that the details \u2013 and, indeed, the whole framework \u2013 could be abandoned and replaced by the (undefined) notion of a 'reasonable return' does not, in the view of the Tribunal, correspond to the way in which RD 661/2007 was presented or to the way in which it was intended to be and was understood by the renewable energy industry. RD 661/2007 was presented as a regulatory regime that guaranteed fixed tariffs for a fixed term to investors who constructed and were allowed to register qualifying facilities before the RD 661/2007 register was closed to new investments. Those are the assurances that the Tribunal finds were made in and in relation to RD 661.\n\nProf. Arag\u00f3n's Opinion on the Successive Reforms of the Legal Framework Applicable to Renewable Energy, 7 July 2016 (\"Arag\u00f3n ER\"), pp. 26-39.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the assurances were wholly inflexible, leading to the effective 'petrification' of the terms applicable to facilities registered under the RD 661 regime. The sovereign power of States to regulate their economies, and the rights and duties of governments to revise and amend regulatory regimes in the face of changing circumstances and changing policies, is beyond question. Limitations on those powers must not be lightly assumed.\n\n199.\n\nThe question here, however, is not whether Spain had the right and the legal power to amend its regulatory regime. The question here is whether Spain had committed itself to refrain from exercising its undoubted power in a particular manner, so that if it chose to exercise its power in a manner that breached that commitment it may incur liability for losses suffered by those who acted in reliance upon the commitment. There is nothing particularly arcane about this question: it is essentially the mirror image of the question whether a State can, *consistently with the FET provision in ECT Article 10*,301 bind itself to perform a contract, in a manner that cannot be undone by the State enacting legislation that purports to abrogate its contractual obligations. The Tribunal has no doubt that a State can make such commitments and may do so by way of a unilateral declaration or representation.302 Nor does it doubt that in principle a breach of such a commitment can amount to a violation of an FET provision.303\n\nA question that is entirely distinct from the question whether the State may do so under its own municipal law.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., the ILC \"Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations, with commentaries thereto\" (2006), < https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9\\_9\\_2006.pdf >.\n\n*See*, *e.g*, ILC Articles on State Responsibility, comment (3) on Article 12 (RL-0095).\n\n200.\n\nThe line that separates legitimate modifications of the regulatory regime from changes that constitute improper breaches of the commitment to stability is not easily defined. The Tribunal, like others before it, considers that the essential distinction is that between a reasonable modification of the regulatory regime in respect of which the commitment to stability is made and a repudiation or abandonment of that regulatory regime. The regime could be amended and modified, but it was intended that potential investors could and would rely on the stability of the fundamentals of the framework when taking investment decisions.\n\n201.\n\nThe Claimants argued that\n\n*In summary, Spain enacted RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 to guarantee specific tariff rates on all of a qualified plant's production for a defined duration, as stated in Articles 17, 24, 25, and 36. Articles 44.1 and 44.2 provided that Spain would modify those rates annually for existing and future plants based on changes in inflation. Article 44.3 provided that Spain would further modify the rates quadrennially (beginning in 2010) based on factors such as Spain's achievement of its policy objectives and changes in technology costs and the capital markets, but expressly provided that such changes would not apply to existing plants. Apart from those provisions, RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 did not authorize any changes to the economic regime that qualified plants had the explicit right to receive under Articles 17, 24, 25, and 36 of the decree. There is no other reasonable interpretation of the regulatory framework that formed the basis of Claimants' investment decisions.*304\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 240.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the main thrust of that argument, subject to the qualification that modifications to the regime that did not affect its fundamental characteristics could be adopted by Spain without breaching the legitimate expectations of those who had invested on the basis of RD 661/2007. Those fundamental characteristics, in the view of the Tribunal, included the predetermined tariffs, independent of the actual amounts invested in constructing and operating each PV facility and independent of past profits derived from the facility, fixed for a definite period of time which approximated to the useful life of a PV facility,305 and with no minimum or maximum limit on the returns for each plant.306 Spain's commitment was that those fundamentals would not be abrogated.\n\nRD 661/2007 had fixed the tariffs for 25 years, after which the tariff fell to 80% of its previous level. No time limit was set for the receipt of the 80% tariff. *See* RD 661/2007, Article 36 and Table 3 (C-098 (improved)).\n\n*See* Cl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 187, 219\n\n***e. To what extent did each Claimant, in making its investment, rely upon Spain's commitment?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nHaving determined that there is a foundation for the proposition that the Respondent gave assurances concerning the stability of the regime established by RD 661/2007 on which investors were intended and invited to rely, the Tribunal now turns to the question whether the Claimants did in fact rely upon those assurances.\n\n204.\n\nIt is obvious that no investment made before the adoption of RD 661/2007 could be said to have been made in reliance upon it, and that Spain cannot incur liability based on the doctrine of legitimate expectations in relation to such an investment. While some investors, including some or all of the Claimants, may have been following the evolution of Spain's compensation framework for renewable energy for many months before the adoption of RD 661/2007 on 25 May 2007, investments made before its final adoption were necessarily speculative, and made in the hope that what became RD 661/2007 would indeed be enacted in such a form as to provide favourable and secure terms for investors.\n\n205.\n\nThat limitation excludes the following investments in respect of which compensation claims are made:\n\na. the purchase on 30 May 2006 by Claimant 69, Mr. Joachim Kruck, of 50% of the shares in what became307 Solar Andaluz Grundst\u00fccks S.L.;308\n\nb. the purchase on 30 May 2006 by Claimant 72, Mr. Rolf Schumm, via the Spanish company Monte Grace Paradise S.L.

First Kruck WS, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27\u201328. b) Joachim Kruck relied on the advice of his Spanish legal counsel Mafalda Soto. \"In late 2006, I met Ms. Mafalda Soto, a Spanish attorney fluent in German. On several occasions, she spoke with me regarding Spain's new support regime under a proposed regulation on renewables (that ultimately became RD 661/2007), which Spain had announced several months earlier and I had already read about in German media and specialist magazines discussing the PV industry.\" First Kruck WS, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 23. *See also* Second Kruck WS, \u00b6\u00b6 4\u20136, 13\u201314. \"Q.

He confirmed that the Spanish tariffs were granted for the duration and at the rates provided in the regulation. He explained that we could rely on Spain's regulatory framework, because like Germany, Spain was a developed country in the European Union that was bound by the rule of law to honor the commitments it made to investors.\" First Kruck WS, \u00b6 13. *See also* Second Kruck WS, \u00b6 4\u20136, 13\u201314. \"[W]hen I talked with [Mr. Hermoso] about the legal situation in Spain, asking whether it was just as stable as in Germany, he was almost embarrassed. He looked at me and said, 'Where do you think we live? Spain is a civilized country, part of the European Union, and why would be legal situation be less stable than in Germany?'\" Hearing Tr. Day 2, 36:18\u201323 (Testimony of Joachim Kruck). Joachim Kruck reviewed media and specialist publications that confirmed his understanding of RD 661. \"I regularly read the trade press, from 2003 ... onward. In Photon, the trade magazine, there were various articles on various markets in Europe, and a lot of articles on Spain.\" Hearing Tr. Day 2, 17:18\u2013 21 (Testimony of Joachim Kruck). *See also* First Kruck WS \u00b6 11. Joachim Kruck relied on the fact that LBBW and its legal advisors shared his understanding that the Spanish incentive regime was stable. \"All three loans were non-recourse, *i.e.*, without any recourse liability, meaning they would be repaid only from the cash-flows generated by the facilities. LBBW sought advice from the Spanish law firm Rodriguez-Arias and also required confirmation from Ms. Mafalda Soto, who represented DSG GmbH, that the plants could qualify for the RD 661/2007 tariff. Following this due diligence, LBBW proceeded to provide the project loans, clearly indicating that LBBW considered the Spanish tariff regime to be stable.\" First Kruck WS, \u00b6 24.

Day 2, 18:19\u201322. \"[W]e had some loose contacts with other legal counsels via KACO, but they were all saying the same thing, which is that Spain is a safe country, a stable country, in terms of investment, in the European Union, where the legal framework is a good one, the legislation is reliable.\" Hearing Tr.

Day 2, 54:16\u201324. \"Spain was, I think, the most proactive [in promoting its incentive regime. Spain was] \u2013 even if it wasn't just the Spanish Government, the Spanish Chamber would always have a certain area of the booths [at renewable energy trade shows]. They were very active.\" *Id.* 65:20\u201324. Peter Flachsmann relied on Spain's RAIPRE registration process in order to qualify for the incentives guaranteed under the Special Regime. \"I was forced to cancel my honeymoon and instead focus all my efforts on obtaining all of the parts for the facilities so that they could be completed and registered under the regime before the cut-off date. That was how important it was to ensure that the facilities were properly registered in the regime.\" Flachsmann WS, \u00b6 17. *See also* Hearing Tr.

Day 2, 65:2\u20133 (Testimony of Peter Flachsmann). Peter Flachsmann relied on information Ralf Hofmann gave him regarding RD 661, which Ralf Hofmann had learned from announcements of the Spanish Government. *See* Flachsmann WS, \u00b6 9. Peter Flachsmann relied on the fact that his understanding of the RD 661 regime was shared by the rest of the industry. \"There were some kinks with the environment to invest early on. About retroactivity and not having a fixed rate. But then I do remember after RD 661 came out, that's all everybody talked about, is, you know, '[Spain's] finally done it, this is a great environment, it's now bankable, we can go.' ...

Such representations can, however, cast light upon what statements that are attributable to the Respondent were understood to mean by some of those to whom the statements were addressed.

Was that commitment breached by Spain?***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIt was indicated above that the Tribunal considers that the essential distinction that serves to identify an unfair and inequitable breach of a commitment is that between a reasonable modification of the regulatory regime and a repudiation or abandonment of the fundamentals of that regime. The fundamentals of the regime in this case included predetermined tariffs, independent of the actual amounts invested in constructing and operating each PV facility and independent of past profits derived from the facility, fixed for a definite period of time which approximated to the useful life of a PV facility, and with no minimum or maximum limit on the returns for each plant.317\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 37-44 above.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants identify a series of measures that, they submit, breached the commitments relating to the stability of the regime established by RD 661/2007.

The imposition of this 'duration cap' was, as the Claimants observed,322 mitigated by the extension of the full tariff entitlement first to 28 years in 2010323 and then to 30 years in 2011.324\n\nRD 1565/2010 (C-129).\n\nClaimants' Opening Presentation, slide 113.\n\nRDL 14/2010, First final disposition (C-102).\n\nLaw 2/2011, First final provision (C-095).\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the CNE, in its Report 3/2007, had written that\n\n[\u2026] *the study considers a service life of 15 years in general, except in the case of photovoltaic and hydroelectric facilities which are considered at 25 years. In turn, the investment is generally amortised at 15 years, except in the case of photovoltaic and hydroelectric facilities which are amortised at 20 and 25 years respectively.325*\n\nCNE Report 3/2007, p. 22 (R-0116).\n\n216.\n\nWhile Mr. Reiss gave evidence that he expected a PV facility to be in operation for at least 35 to 40 years,326 and Mr. Kruck referred to an operating life of at least 35 years,327 Mr. Matuschke (the head of accounting and the customer relations manager at DSG GmbH and at Kruck & Partner) based his calculations of income from the facilities on a period of 25 years,328 which is also the period given for the 'service life' of PV facilities in the Renewable Energy Plan for Spain 2005-2010.329\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Karsten Reiss, 19 July 2016, \u00b6 16.\n\nFirst Kruck WS, \u00b6 19.\n\nWitness Statement of Klaus Matuschke, 28 July 2016 (\"Matuschke WS\"), \u00b6 8.\n\nSpain's Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010, August 2005 (\"Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010\"), pp. 295-298 (R-0107).\n\n217.\n\nThe imposition of a 30-year cap in place of the '25 years + operating life' entitlement under RD 661/2007 can thus be seen as the replacement of an actual operating life with a notional but realistic one. Furthermore, the variations were only to have effect two decades ahead, at the end of the expected working life of the investment. The Tribunal does not consider this to be a fundamental change in the compensation framework or a break with the promised regime.\n\n218.\n\nThe caps330 imposed by RDL 14/2010 on the number of hours each year for which the full tariff was payable (sales of electricity in excess of the cap being made at market rates, which are much lower than the regulated tariff331) were set by reference to the estimate in the Renewable Energy Plan for Spain 2005-2010 of the annual operating hours of a standard facility.332 It was acknowledged that the caps could entail a loss of revenue for producers, and that possibility was addressed by making compensating adjustments to the period over which the regulated tariffs would be payable:\n\n[\u2026] *in the actual operation of the system, it has been shown that there are more operating hours at the facilities than initially planned in some cases. There are diverse reasons for this \u2013 technical improvement, over-installation, etc. In any case, this means that for these facilities the compensation obtained is more than reasonable.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*In order to compensate the reduction that these measures could cause, the period for receiving compensation for photovoltaic facilities under Royal Decree 661/2007 has been extended from 25 to 28 years.*333\n\nThere was a 3-year temporary or transitory cap, and a slightly higher and apparently permanent cap. *See* Cl.

The Tribunal does not consider the 2010 cap on hours to be a fundamental change in the compensation framework or a break with the promised regime that constitutes a violation of ECT Article 10.\n\n220.\n\nThe manner in which the CPI was calculated was amended by RDL 2/2013.334 The Tribunal regards this as a technical adjustment of the kind that investors must expect may occur from time to time, and does not consider it to be a fundamental change in the compensation framework or a break with the promised regime.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 837-845.\n\n221.\n\nThe New Regulatory Regime presaged by RDL 9/2013 (12 July 2013)335 was very different. RDL 9/2013 repealed RD 661/2007 and replaced it with what Law 24/2013 called \"new specific remuneration regimes to promote production from sources of renewable energies\", describing the change as a \"general overhaul of the sector based on a new income and expenses' regime for the electric system which is seeking to give back to the system a financial sustainability which it lost a long time ago and whose eradication has not been achieved to date through the adoption of partial measures.\"336\n\nRDL 9/2013 (C-091).\n\nLaw 24/2013 (C-180).\n\n222.\n\nThe New Regulatory Regime was established by a series of measures including RDL 9/2013 (12 July 2013);337 Law 24/2013 (26 December 2013);338 RD 413/2014 (6 June 2014);339 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 (16 June 2014).340 The details of the new regime were settled only in June 2014. By that date it was evident that the regime established by RD 661/2007 had been completely replaced by the new regime which abandoned the previous guaranteed price mechanisms and replaced it with a regime in which prices were set so as to deliver a \"reasonable rate of return\" to electricity producers, calculated for each PV installation according to its installed capacity. The calculation of the remuneration for an actual PV facility was made by reference to the deemed costs of operating costs of one of the hundreds of hypothetical 'standard facilities' defined in Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014. The hypothetical standard facility would be selected to correspond to the installed capacity of the actual plant. The remuneration was also linked to the historic ten-year average yield of ten-year Spanish treasury bonds. The New Regulatory Regime provided that its investment incentives were to be reviewed every six years.\n\nRDL 9/2013 (C-091).\n\nLaw 24/2013 (C-180).\n\nRD 413/2014 (R-0095/C-090).\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014 (R-0101/C-179).\n\n223.\n\nTying the remuneration of plants to that of hypothetical 'standard facilities' meant that the New Regulatory Regime was, in the words of one of the Claimants' experts, \"based on the installed power instead of on the production\" of actual PV facilities:341 As he said, \"[w]ith the new regulatory framework, the remuneration parameters are not linked to the actual production of each plant but to the production assigned to the standard facility assigned to the plant. The high investment and maintenance costs of facilities that sought greater efficiency and returns do not have any impact on the remuneration of renewables.\"342 The rate of return \"has turned out to be the same for all facilities under the new framework, including all technologies with different degrees of development.\"343 That is not entirely accurate: an operator could increase its return by operating more efficiently than was assumed in the calculation of the 'standard' rate, or reduce its return by operating less efficiently. Nonetheless, the new regime indisputably made a fundamental shift in the economic basis of the PV facilities by abolishing the fixed tariffs that had been guaranteed by RD 661/2007 when the investment in the PV facilities were made, and replacing them with what Spain considered to be a \"reasonable rate of return\" for the PV facility in question.\n\nMargarit ER, p. 56\n\nMargarit ER, p. 57.\n\nMargarit ER, p. 57.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that it does not dispute that the New Regulatory Regime and its target 'reasonable rate of return' were perfectly reasonable when viewed in their own terms and in isolation from the history of investment in PV plants in Spain. The New Regulatory Regime was reasonable: and in particular it was a reasonable response to the economic difficulties that continued to beset Spain's market for electricity. What was not reasonable was the imposition of the New Regulatory Regime upon investors who had already committed the large up-front capital expenditures necessary to construct and commission PV plants and had done so in reliance upon the commitment by Spain to offer fixed, pre-determined Feed-In Tariffs for the whole of their electricity production over a period of 25 years (with 80% of that tariff payable thereafter).\n\n225.\n\nThat denial of the legitimate expectations of the DSG Claimants amounts to a breach of their right to Fair and Equitable Treatment under Article 10 of the ECT. To the extent that they suffered financial losses as a result of that breach, the Respondent is liable to compensate them. This element of the DSG Claimants' claim is upheld. The question of the amount of compensation is addressed below.\n\n**B.

The Claimants argue that it is not sufficient for the Respondent to point to any reason for its policy choice; such choice must be justified in light of the Respondent's duty to protect the investors, their expectations and its duty to encourage investment.349 The Respondent decided to back out of the explicit promises made to the Claimants because it decided that renewable energy producers should bear the burden of the tariff deficit Spain created. The State chose to target renewable energy producers because of the adverse political implications of addressing the deficit by raising prices for the end-consumers.350\n\nCl.

By doing so, without reason, the Respondent imposed the burden of the tariff deficit on the renewable energy investors.351 The 2009 APPA proposal, which the Respondent alleges was similar to the New Regulatory Regime, in reality dealt with future facilities and did not involve retroactive changes to RD 661/2007 or RD 1578/2008 that could affect facilities already in operation.352\n\nCl.

In the Claimants' view, most investors do not want regulatory modifications that destroy their expected returns. In addition, the main reason behind the boom was \"the desire of certain investors to get rid of distressed assets.\"353 What Spain portrays as an approval of its regulatory changes by international institutions are in fact nothing more than \"general statements about the desirability of eliminating the Tariff Deficit.\"354\n\nCl.

For example, it was unreasonable for the Respondent to adopt measures imposing operating hour limits on plants that could not be shut down; to impose a so-called tax on incentive revenues; and to manipulate routine adjustments based on the CPI.355\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 445.\n\n234.\n\n*Second*, it was unreasonable for the Respondent to treat the Claimants and other investors in the renewable energy sector as the cause of Spain's tariff deficit, making them bear the burden of the solution.356\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 446; *citing* Margarit ER, pp. 45-47.\n\n235.\n\n*Third,* the new remuneration methodology applicable to renewable energy facilities is based on production capacity and not on actual generation. This affects the manner in which plants were and are going to be designed given that higher performance by the introduction of photovoltaic panels with greater performance will not be rewarded.357\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 446; *citing* Margarit ER, p. 51.\n\n236.\n\n*Fourth,* such remuneration methodology based on production capacity may be more beneficial for existing \"bad projects\" than for existing \"good projects\". Projects that were designed to maximize production above the standard facility's production will receive lower prices per kWh generated than those facilities that produce less energy.358\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 446; *citing* Margarit ER, p. 51.\n\n237.\n\n*Fifth*, it is unreasonable to link the reasonable return to the 10-year State bond's yield. Once the investment is made, the investor's leeway is reduced, which makes it inappropriate to modify the target return throughout the project's useful life. In any event, if such modification is intended, there is no reason to link it to variations of a financial instrument that is sensible to factors that may have nothing to do with the generation of electricity.359\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 446; *citing* Margarit ER, p. 52.\n\n238.\n\n*Sixth,* the New Regulatory Framework provides for regulatory periods of six (6) years, divided in semi-periods of three (3) years over which the main regulatory parameters remain valid. This affects the long-term predictability of the investment and the project's returns, and the capacity of the investor to adapt to new situations becomes almost non-existent.360\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 446; *citing* Margarit ER, p. 52.\n\n239.\n\n*Seventh*, the reasonable return expected from the renewable energy producers is not required from other energy generation technologies (e.g. nuclear and large hydro). If the rationale of the reform is to correct the economic imbalance of the electricity sector, it is irrational not to \"rationalize the remuneration of old ordinary regime nuclear plants and large hydro plants.\"361\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 446; *citing* Margarit ER, p. 52.\n\n240.\n\n*Eighth,* there is no justification for the definition of standard facilities and parameters used to determine the remuneration of each facility. The IDAE had commissioned two studies to collect information on the operating parameters of renewable plants. However, one study was never completed and the other was completed after the issuance of Ministerial Order IET/10452014 which set the standards to be used. Therefore, the procedure and methodology used to determine the parameters for standard facilities and remuneration were not transparent and also lacked rationality.362\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 446; *citing* Margarit ER, pp. 52-53.\n\n241.\n\n*Ninth*, the economic impact of the reform focuses only on producers of renewable energy without making an adequate cost-benefit analysis. The positive externalities created by the production of renewable energy, such as the reduction of the market price and costs associated with CO2, were not taken into consideration.363\n\nCl.

This boom in the renewable energy sector demonstrates that the new regulations guaranteed a reasonable rate of return.384\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 1204; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 1203.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no evidence whatever that suggests that the Spanish measures were discriminatory.\n\n259.\n\nAs to the question of unreasonableness, the Tribunal considers that the regulatory regime introduced to replace that established by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 was, in its own terms and viewed in isolation, completely reasonable. The regime established by RD 661/2007 had been very successful in attracting investment in renewable energy production in Spain, and in propelling Spain towards the fulfilment of its renewable energy goals. It was, however, not sustainable as a continuing basis for attracting such investment. The incentives offered by the RD 661/2007 scheme were not compatible with the (equally reasonable) Spanish policy on prices to be charged to electricity consumers and on the balancing of the budget. Something plainly needed to change; and the new regulatory regime was in its own terms an inherently reasonable and pragmatic response to the exigencies of the urgent and unsustainable position.\n\n260.\n\nThe new regulatory regime cannot, however, be viewed in isolation. The Spanish renewables regimes were both instrumental and regulatory: they were intended both to attract necessary investment and to regulate it after the investment had been made. In so far as concerns electricity produced from PV sources the regime established by RD 661/2007, on the basis of which all of the DSG Claimants' investments were made, had as its basis and most salient feature an assurance of fixed tariffs for a defined term of years to be paid in respect of qualified, registered PV facilities. The repudiation of that assurance was not reasonable. But what made it unreasonable was not the inherent character of the measures themselves but the fact that those measures entailed a denial of the legitimate expectations of the DSG investors.\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly considers that while the adoption of the measures was a breach of the right of the DSG Claimants to fair and equitable treatment, the measures did not themselves constitute an independent violation of the DSG Claimants' rights not to have the management, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory measures. This element of the DSG Claimants' claim is dismissed.\n\n**C. Umbrella Clause**\n----------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n262.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, to act in accordance with Article 10(1) of the ECT, the Respondent had to \"observe any obligations it has entered into with [the Claimants].\" Such provision, as interpreted by previous tribunals and in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, covers any obligation irrespective of whether it is of a contractual, legislative or regulatory nature. If the Contracting Parties to the ECT had the intention to limit the scope of such provision, they would have done so expressly.387\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 449-456; Cl.

Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Respondent denies that there was any expropriation of the Claimants' future returns or of the Claimants' shareholdings.421 The Respondent argues that Article 13(3) of the ECT requires the Claimants to demonstrate that they have the \"ownership over the allegedly expropriated asset\", and that there is a causal link between the measures adopted by the State and the effect of the measures over the asset ownership.422\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1241-1242.\n\n283.\n\nUnder Spanish law, the relevant law to determine what rights are protected against expropriation,424 it is only possible to claim ownership of acquired rights and not over future returns not yet received.425 Similarly, under international law, there cannot be expropriation of \"hypothetical and potential rights*.*\"426 As a consequence, the future returns that the Claimants expected to receive do not fall under the definition of a protected investment under Article 1(6) of the ECT and, thus, are not protected under Article 13 of the ECT.427 The only acquired right that the facilities and the Claimants had was to receive the tariffs set in RD 661/2007 for the energy already sold.428\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 1262.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent thus concludes that it has not unlawfully expropriated the Claimants' investment, has not violated Article 13 of the ECT, and does not have the obligation to pay any compensation.444\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1237, 1254, 1275; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 1252, 1256; Resp. PHB, \u00b6 123.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider this plea to be duplicative: an expropriation could have occurred whether or not there was any denial of legitimate expectations violating the right to fair and equitable treatment under Article 10 of the ECT. The Tribunal does, however, consider the pleas to be misconceived. ECT Article 13 provides that investments \"shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.\" 'Expropriation' is a term of art. While it might be said that the loss of any aspect or morsel of the value or enjoyment of an investment entirely deprives that investor of that aspect or morsel, the law would lose something of its practical value if every such deprivation were to be regarded as an expropriation.\n\n291.\n\nCircumstances where an investor retains legal title, possession and control of its investment, and its essential complaint is that it is receiving less income from the investment than it had the right to expect, do not necessarily constitute an expropriation. 'Expropriation' connotes a taking of the whole or a substantial part of an investment or a degree of interference with the enjoyment of the rights of ownership or control that is tantamount to such a taking. To extend the notion of 'expropriation' to all instances of the impairment of the enjoyment of an investment or the disappointment of expected benefits does no service to international law and deprives the drafters of treaties and contracts of the utility of a valuable legal concept.\n\n292.\n\nIn the present case Spain did nothing that might be interpreted as an attempt to wrest control of the PV facilities from the DSG investors, and nothing beyond the amendments of the tariffs to impede their enjoyment of the benefit of owning those facilities. The claims of violations of the ECT Article 10 guarantee against treatment that is not fair and equitable were well framed, and have been upheld by the Tribunal. The claim of expropriation is not. That claim is dismissed.\n\n**E. The Defense of Necessity**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n293.\n\nAlthough the Claimants note that the Respondent did not expressly invoke a necessity defense, they maintain that the Respondent did so implicitly under the guise of the right to regulate.445 Accordingly, the Claimants reject the argument that the measures adopted by the Respondent were \"'necessary macroeconomic control measures.'\"446\n\nTr.

Reply, \u00b6 536.\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimants argue that: ***(1)*** none of the authorities referred to by the Respondent addressed the issue of necessity; ***(2)*** the necessity defense is not available to the Respondent; ***(3)*** even if such defense was available, the Respondent has not met the applicable standard; and ***(4)*** even if the Respondent had met such standard, it would still have to compensate the Claimants.\n\n295.\n\n*First*, with respect to the authorities relied upon by Spain, the Claimants have two arguments. They argue that the statements by domestic courts are irrelevant for determining whether domestic acts are international wrongful acts.447 In addition, none of the statements cited by the Respondent address the issue of whether the contested measures were necessary to solve a new or urgent problem.448 Therefore, the Respondent has failed to establish that it needed to reduce the incentives that had been granted to the facilities under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 to address the tariff deficit.449\n\nCl.

The Tribunal recalls that the legality under Spanish Law, and the rationality and proportionality of the 'new regime' introduced in 2013 have not been questioned by the Tribunal, which has based its decision on the compatibility of Spanish regulatory measures with the assurances given by the respondent in and in relation to RD 661/2007.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that Spain violated the rights of the DSG Claimants under the ECT to fair and equitable treatment by establishing the New Regulatory Regime.471\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 211-225 above.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the New Regulatory Regime was established by a series of measures including RDL 9/2013 (12 July 2013);472 Law 24/2013 (26 December 2013);473 RD 413/2014 (6 June 2014),474 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 (16 June 2014).475 It is accordingly arguable that the date of the breach used for the calculation of compensation should be earlier than 16 June 2014. Nonetheless, in circumstances where (as here) the breach consists in the repudiation and alteration of the fundamental principles of a regulatory regime upon which the claimants were entitled to and did rely in making their investment, it is the definitive adoption of the new regime that should be regarded as the occasion of the breach. That definitive adoption occurs when all of the essential components of the new regime are in place and in effect.\n\nRDL 9/2013 (C-091).\n\nLaw 24/2013 (C-180).\n\nRD 413/2014 (R-0095/C-090).\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014 (R-0101/C-179). *See also* \u00b6\u00b6 64, 212.e, and 222 above.\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly regards the adoption of Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 on 16 June 2014 as the decisive step in the establishment of the New Regulatory Regime. The Order is dated 16 June 2014 and was published in the *Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado* (BOE) on 20 June 2014. The Order provides that it shall be effective as of the day following its publication in the BOE. The Tribunal accordingly sets 21 June 2014 as the effective date of the violation. Compensation is accordingly due to the DSG Claimants for financial losses caused by that breach of the ECT. That date coincides with the valuation date adopted by the Claimants in the present case.476 The quantification of that compensation is addressed in this section of the Award.\n\n*See* \u00b6 311 below.\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1). Claimants' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they are entitled to full compensation for losses caused by Spain's violations of the ECT. After describing the applicable standard of compensation, the Claimants present their arguments on the quantum of compensation owed by Spain, including pre- and post-award interest and a tax gross-up.477 The Claimants refute the Respondent's quantum case, which they say merely \"regurgitates its case on liability in the language of a quantum analysis\"478 by contending that \"damages should be calculated assuming that Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable rate of return, and not the tariff rates guaranteed in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 that are the essence of Claimants' case.\"479 In sum, Spain's arguments do not respond to the Claimants' case and should be disregarded.480\n\nCl.

The applicable compensation standard***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the compensation standard is governed by the *lex specialis*, which is to be found in the ECT, and in the absence of any *lex specialis*, by customary international law (\"**CIL**\").481 The Claimants further argue that the ECT only provides for the conditions to be satisfied in order to lawfully expropriate investments and does not provide a standard for compensation of other ECT violations, thus requiring recourse to CIL to fill the *lacuna*.482\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 485.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 485.\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the 1928 *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* PICJ case establishes the principle of full compensation applicable in this case, according to which \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"483 According to the Claimants, *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* has been followed in subsequent cases in which tribunals have confirmed that claimants are entitled to full compensation for unlawful expropriation and other treaty violations.484 Quoting the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Azurix v. Argentina*, the Claimants argue that \"for breaches of BIT obligations other than the expropriation clause, the Tribunal has a discretion in determining the approach to damages.\"485 The Claimants conclude as follows:\n\n*Claimants are entitled to full compensation for Spain's violations of the ECT's provisions relating to fair and equitable treatment, non-impairment of investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the umbrella clause, and unlawful expropriation. Although Claimants contend that Spain breached each of those standards under Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT in multiple respects, a violation of any one of them would entitle Claimants to full compensation.*486\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 486 quoting *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

Mem., \u00b6 492.\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimants invite the Tribunal to follow \"the traditional approach adopted in *Eiser*, *Novenergia*, *Masdar*, *Antin*, *Foresight*, *Cube* and *SolEs* by assessing what the value of Claimants' investment would have been under RD 661 and RD 1578 in the absence of the illegal measures, without resort to some arbitrary and hypothetical level of reasonable return.\"487\n\nCl.

The quantum of compensation owed by Spain***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nConsistent with the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* compensation standard, the damages sought by the Claimants are \"the diminution in the fair market value of their investments, calculated according to the discounted cash flow ('DCF') method, caused by Spain's violations of the ECT.\"488 The Claimants' quantum experts, the Brattle Group (\"**Brattle**\"), calculate the amount of compensation owed to the Claimants using the difference in cash flows between a \"But For Scenario\" and an \"Actual Scenario\", i.e. the difference between \"(a) the value that the Claimants' investments in Spain would have had if Spain had not introduced the measures that Claimants contend in this arbitration violated the ECT (the 'But For Scenario'); and (b) the value of those investments after the introduction of those measures (the 'Actual Scenario').\"489 The investments that Brattle thus values are:\n\n*[\u2026] (1) the shareholder Claimants' equity interests in, and shareholder loans to, the operating companies that own the thirteen PV Projects in Spain (the \"Shareholder\" or \"Ownership Investments\"); and (2) the expected contractual returns of DSG GmbH and (through their respective ownership interests in real estate companies, Solar Andaluz Grundst\u00fccks S.L. and Deutsche Solar Ib\u00e9rica Real Estate S.L.)

According to the Claimants \"that is when the impact of the final and most significant measure at issue in the dispute \u2013 the New Regulatory Regime \u2013 was fully known.\"491\n\nCl.

If anything, the fact that most of a PV plant's costs are fixed makes a DCF calculation less speculative because it makes future cash flows less sensitive to assumptions about future operating costs.492 So does the fact that cash flows are generated by tangible assets.493 In fact, PV plant cash flows are \"highly predictable\" because \"[p]roducing electricity is a relatively simple business.\"494 The Claimants add that \"Spain itself used the DCF method when it designed the tariffs under RD 661/2007 [\u2026].\"495 Finally, the Claimants refute Spain's argument that the DCF method would be inappropriate \"because of the 'disproportion between the alleged investments (and the alleged assumed risk) and the amount claimed, evidenced by the return obtained.'\"496\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6 498; First Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 39-42.\n\n316.\n\nOver the period December 2010-June 2014, the Claimants say that the disputed measures would have reduced the free cash flows (including interest) of the DSG Claimants' PV Projects by \u20ac3.9 million.508\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 498; First Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6 43.\n\n317.\n\nAs to the future effects of the disputed measures on the PV projects, the Claimants and Brattle calculate them using the DCF method, \"the primary valuation tool in the power sector\" because the \"relatively simple business model\" of operating power stations offers predictability.509 The Claimants emphasize that Brattle provides two DCF calculations for the PV projects in each of the operating companies, one for each scenario.510 The But For Scenario and the Actual Scenario share certain assumptions regarding variables such as future power production, inflation, the effect of RDL 12/2012, and use of the \"Adjusted Present Value\" (\"**APV**\"), which is similar to the \"Weighted Average Cost of Capital\" (\"**WACC**\").511 Assumptions differ with respect to market revenue (the But For Scenario does not include any market revenue, only feed-in tariff revenue), financial support (in the But For Scenario there is a feed-in tariff, in the Actual Scenario it is replaced by the investment incentive and the operative incentive under RDL 9/2013), the duration of the useful life of facilities, OPEX costs (some of which vary), and \"taxes\" (the 7% reduction of the feed-in tariff is not imposed in the But For Scenario).512\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6 501.\n\n318.\n\nOn the basis of these assumptions, when comparing both scenarios, Brattle shows that the future effect of the disputed measures translates into a fall of \u20ac45.5 million in future free cash flows for the DSG Claimants' PV projects.513 Then, \"[t]o assess the impact of those reduced cash flows on the present value of the Claimants' Shareholder Investments, Brattle first discounts the cash flows to determine the 'base-case' or 'all-equity' value of the operating assets in the But For and Actual Scenarios, and then adjusts for certain tax, debt, and liquidity issues to arrive at the present value of the Claimants' equity interests in both the But For and Actual scenarios.\"514 The Claimants point out that Brattle first uses a 4.84% discount rate derived from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\"**CAPM**\") to discount the expected free cash flows in each scenario.515 The Claimants then underline that Brattle also applies a \"revenue haircut\" to account for the increased regulatory risk resulting from the disputed measures,516 this risk - and the attendant haircut \u2013 being greater in the Actual Scenario.517 With the application of the discount rate and the revenue haircut, the Claimants conclude with Brattle that \"the disputed measures reduced the enterprise value of the DSG Claimants' PV Projects by \u20ac23.6 million (33%).\"518 After computing \"the impact of Spain's measures on the shareholder Claimants' equity interests [\u2026] by adjusting for several effects related to the project debt and the illiquid nature of those Claimants' interests\",519 Brattle further concludes that these measures reduced the fair market value of the DSG Claimants' Shareholder Investments on the Valuation Date by \u20ac17.5 million on the Valuation Date.520\n\nCl.

DSG GmbH, which according to the Claimants \"is entitled to receive a bonus payment of 10% of excess proceeds received by Project Alcolea and 50% of excess proceeds received by Projects Calasparra and Tordesillas\" under DSG GmbH's management contracts;522\n\nb. Mr. Joachim Kruck, Mr. Peter Flachsmann, Mr. Ralf Hofmann, Mr. Frank Schumm, and Mr. Rolf Schumm, who \"are entitled to bonus payments of 30% of excess proceeds received by Project Alcolea\" as a result of their ownership of the Project Alcolea real estate company Solar Andaluz Grundst\u00fccks S.L..523 These same individuals, through their ownership of Solar Andaluz Grundst\u00fccks S.L., intended to exercise the right to purchase all of the shares in each of the twenty Alcolea SPVs and their PV facilities upon expiration of the twenty-five year lease;524 and\n\nc. Mr. Joachim Kruck, Mr. Peter Flachsmann, and Mr. Ralf Hofmann, who jointly own Deutsche Solar Ib\u00e9rica Real Estate S.L., the company that leases land for Projects Calasparra and Tordesillas, which was intended to exercise the company's right to purchase the forty-five Calasparra and Tordesillas SPVs and plants at the end of the twenty-five year leases.525\n\nCl.

Brattle refers to these claims as the Calasparra and Tordesillas \"Call Options.\"\n\n320.\n\nIn order to calculate the damage allegedly suffered by the Claimants holding these contract rights, Brattle proceeds as follows:\n\n*Brattle assumes the same solar production in the But For and Actual scenarios, as well as the possibility of above-threshold production. The absence of bonuses in the Actual scenario caused by Spain's measures reduces the value of the facilities' excess production. Because the bonus payments are subordinate to external debt repayments, Brattle then discounts the expected bonus payments at the equity yield for each project.*526\n\nCl.

When like-for-like comparability is achieved with adjustments to the benchmarks, the results show that \"the New Regime reduces the allowed return from the levels originally considered reasonable by the Ministry and the CNE in 2007, at the introduction of the Original Regulatory Regime.\"534\n\nCl.

While acknowledging in its own DCF analysis that the disputed measures reduced the plants' pre-tax cash flows,535 Spain and AMG conclude that the disputed measures increased the value of the Claimants' investments \"by applying enormous discounts for regulatory risk and illiquidity in the But For scenario, based on a theory that Claimants' PV investments were much riskier in the But For scenario [\u2026] than in the Actual scenario [\u2026].\"536 According to the Claimants, AMG's analysis is undercut by multiple errors, many of which reflect a denial of Spain's liability.537\n\nCl.

A damages award to Claimant DSG GmbH, however, will be subject to German corporate income tax. Thus, a tax \"gross-up\" is required to avoid double-counting the tax. Brattle has calculated the amount of that gross-up to be \u20ac1.008 million, which should be added to the award to DSG GmbH (for a total award of \u20ac3.381 million).*547\n\nCl.

Respondent's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nRelying on the First and Second AMG Expert Reports, Spain argues that the Claimants have no right to the compensation they seek.548 According to Spain, the regulatory regime in place since 1997 has always provided a reasonable rate of return (\"**RRoR**\"), which shows that the Claimants' claims for damages are baseless.549 In addition, Spain submits that it has proved that it has not violated the provisions of the ECT.550 Spain's arguments on quantum are presented as alternative arguments, in the event that the Tribunal were to uphold jurisdiction and find Spain liable for breach of the ECT.551 Spain presents the following eight arguments on quantum:\n\na. The Claimants' alleged damages are \"completely and absolutely speculative\";552\n\nb. The DCF method is not appropriate in this case, as is confirmed by cases and scholarly commentary;553\n\nc. The return rates calculated by the Claimants are \"abnormal\" and their accounting records do not take into account the loss of value of their assets;554\n\nd. Using the DCF method, AMG calculates that the dispute measures have resulted in an increase in value of \u20ac15.3 million for the Claimants;555\n\ne. If the Tribunal holds that all of the disputed measures adopted by Spain are unlawful, it will have to determine the \"stand alone impact of the different measures\";556\n\nf.

The Claimants' alleged damages are \"completely and absolutely speculative\"***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nSpain opposes what it describes as the Claimants' speculative claim for compensation on the grounds that the June 2014 valuation date was \"randomly chosen\"560 and that the Claimants' approach distinguishing historical and future cash flows is flawed.561 Spain argues that:\n\n*By Law, photovoltaic plants are guaranteed a reasonable rate of return, protected from market uncertainty and fluctuations. Precisely for this reason, it seems paradoxical that, with respect to an investment with reasonable rate of return guaranteed by Law, a privilege enjoyed by very few investors, the Claimant claims a violation of the FET standard.*\n\n*With regard to said guarantee, the Claimant attempts to base their claim on a simplistic comparison of scenarios (\"actual\" and but for), assuming that the \"real\" scenario will be maintained over the coming decades and ignoring the fact that the guarantee of reasonable profitability is the guiding principle of the system. It is because of all this that the projection of the existing parameters is hypothetical and illusory.*562\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1284.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1285.\n\nResp.

According to Spain, the Supreme Court has consistently held in similar circumstances that damages have not been proven in cases where they were calculated based on extrapolations over a thirty-year period and there was no guarantee that the remuneration would remain the same (though the applicable regime ensured a RRoR).563 Spain endorses the Supreme Court's view that the determination of these extrapolations \"lack[ed] the necessary rigour and security\", and according to Spain these extrapolations are the same ones that the Brattle Group had to determine.564 In addition, the Supreme Court's statements were not an interpretation of Spanish law on the energy sector, but rather an assessment of the factual evidence before it.565 In the present case, Spain says, the Claimants have also failed to meet the burden of proof.566\n\nResp.

Practically all its costs arise from investing in tangible infrastructure. There are no relevant intangible assets to analyse.*\n\n*b) The high dependency of the cash flows on external, volatile and unpredictable elements, such as the price of the pool, inter alia.*\n\n*c) The long-term nature of the forecasts.*\n\n*d) The disproportion between the alleged investments (and the alleged assumed risk) and the amount claimed, evidenced by the return obtained.*568\n\nResp.

The return rates calculated by the Claimants are \"abnormal\" and their accounting records do not take into account the loss of value of their assets***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nRelying on the First and Second AMG Expert Report, Spain contends that \"the DCF method used by Brattle provides abnormal results\", which should be disregarded.570 According to the First AMG Expert Report, \"in the But-for scenario calculated by Brattle the IRR obtained for the Claimants would be 25.54%. A rate significantly higher than the reasonable rate in a regulated and subsidised sector.\"571 In addition, the financial statements of the DSG and TAUBER Groups show no accounting impairment due to a loss of value of their assets over the 2007-2014 period.572 In its Second Expert Report, AMG states that it has updated its assessment of the IRR and, using the parameters of CAPEX and OPEX set by the OM 1045/2014, concludes that \"the [Claimants'] Plants broadly attain the RRoR, with the weighted average of the pre-tax IRRp for all of them being 7.749% [\u2026].\"573 AMG further concludes that \"[\u2026] the DSG plants (Alcolea, Calasparra and Tordesillas) obtain a project IRR of between 8.47% and 10.21%, well above the RRoR.\"574 Spain argues that AMG's calculations reflected in the graph below575 show that \"the plants are obtaining, after the [disputed] measures, returns that are even higher than the benchmark returns.\"576\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image/24fdf043f0e63f0f5803ed569325283bf513fee3.png)\n\nResp.

Spain contends that:\n\n*AMG has considered a useful life of plants in the But-for scenario of 30 years, which is the maximum according to the available information. Also, AMG has taken into account (as opposed to Brattle) that the conditions of the but-for scenario would obviously have a greater risk and greater uncertainty than the current scenario. The revenue would be subject to greater risk in the But-for scenario. In fact, in the Actual scenario, under the current regulations, we find a stable, more predictable framework with less risk. This is undoubtedly proved by the valuations of the market agents and the numerous transactions that have taken place since the adoption of the challenged measures. These considerations, logically, will have their impact on the different discount rates to be taken into account and on the various marketability discounts to apply.*579\n\nResp.

Therefore, the interest rate has to be free from risk and with a maximum time limit (a shorter term rate could be taken given that a priori the final term is unknown) of 3 years, which could be a reasonable estimate in this case between the Date of Valuation and the date of the award.586*\n\nResp.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nOnce it is determined that a breach of a claimant's rights has occurred the first and most important question is what form the relief should take.\n\n344.\n\nThe DSG Claimants' Request for Relief, as set out in paragraph 614 of their Reply, reads as follows:\n\n*Claimants respectfully request an Award granting them the following relief:*\n\n\u2022 *a declaration that the Tribunal had jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID Convention;*\n\n\u2022 *a declaration that Spain has violated Part III of the ECT and international law with respect to Claimants' investments;*\n\n\u2022 *compensation to Claimants for all damages they have suffered as set forth in this Reply and Claimants' Memorial on the Merits and as will be further developed and quantified in the course of this proceeding;*\n\n\u2022 *all costs of this proceeding, including (but not limited to) Claimants' attorneys' fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of Claimants' experts, and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID;*\n\n\u2022 *pre- and post-award compound interest at the highest lawful rate from the Date of Assessment until Spain's full and final satisfaction of the Award; and*\n\n\u2022 *any other relief the Tribunal deems just and proper.*\n\n345.\n\nThere is no difficulty with the ordering of declaratory relief. It follows practically automatically from a finding by a tribunal that a claimant's rights have been violated. Compensation is less straightforward.\n\n346.\n\nReference to the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice600 as a prelude to discussion of quantum has become almost a matter of politesse in investor-State arbitration. The much-quoted passage from *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* asserts that\n\n*The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act\u2013a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals\u2013is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it\u2013such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.*601\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, pp. 46-47 (CL-116).\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, p. 47 (CL-116).\n\n347.\n\nIt is important to recall that the passage occurred in the course of the Court's reasoning on an unlawful seizure of property.602 Monetary compensation was treated by the Court as an appropriate form of reparation if restitution of the seized property was not possible. In that context the determination of the value of the property that has been unlawfully seized is a natural and obvious point of reference for reparation. It compensates the former owner for the value of what was lost, and it prevents the seizing State from benefiting from the unlawful seizure. And it will be noted that the Court also contemplated \"the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place.\" That is, any losses in addition to the loss of the property seized, which were also caused by the unlawful act, could be compensated by damages awarded in addition to the value of the property.\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, p. 46 (CL-116).\n\n348.\n\nIn the present case there has been no taking of property. The Tribunal has determined that no expropriation occurred. The breaches of the rights of the DSG Claimants were breaches of their right to fair and equitable treatment. In terms of the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* analysis, this is not a case where the 'loss sustained' could be covered by restitution. There was no suggestion in this case that the Claimants already had legal title to the monies that they expected to be paid as tariffs by Spain, so that non-payment might arguably have been tantamount to the seizure of the Claimants' property. Any loss sustained as a result of the breach of the Claimants' rights to fair and equitable treatment is, in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* terms, a \"loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place.\"\n\n349.\n\nThat being the case, the Tribunal does not consider that reference to the value of the Claimants' investments is necessarily the appropriate form of reparation. To use the words of the Request for Relief, such reference is not necessarily the basis for relief that the Tribunal deems \"just and proper.\" Compensation based on the value of the Claimants' investments \u2013 or more precisely, on the effect of Spain's action on the value of those investments \u2013 is not necessarily the only or best way to \"make reparation in an adequate form\", to borrow the phrase used by the Permanent Court of International Justice in an earlier phase of the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case.603 That is particularly true where the valuation is established on the basis of valuations of 'actual' and 'but for' scenarios.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, Jurisdiction, Judgment No. 8, PCIJ, Series A, No. 9, 26 July 1927, p. 21.\n\n350.\n\nThe difficulties of using the 'But-for' approach to the quantification of damages for breach of an FET obligation are evident. The Respondent has argued that if Spain had not removed the fixed tariffs and introduced the New Regulatory Regime, it is very probable that it would still have had to take some measures to address the persistent budget deficit. The Tribunal agrees. There was plainly a need to deal with the deficit. The FET obligation is an obligation not to treat investments unfairly or inequitably: it is not an obligation to do nothing that has the slightest impact upon the value of the investment. If Spain had taken different measures, consistent with all of its ECT obligations including the FET obligation, it seems likely that the measures would have had an impact on the valuation of the investments.\n\n351.\n\nThe uncertainty works both ways. If the Claimants had been able to maximise their returns by arranging their commercial and financial transactions and relationships in the manner that would have derived the optimum benefit from the prompt and full payment of tariffs in accordance with RD 661/2077, that too would probably have impacted the value of the investments.\n\n352.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent's suggestion that the 'But-for' scenario is entirely and irredeemably speculative. The breach of the FET obligation in the ECT in the present case was constituted by the wrongful disappointment of what was a legitimate expectation that the promised fixed tariffs would be paid for the promised period. That is another way of saying that the Claimants were entitled to rely upon the stability *grosso modo* of the promised regime: that is an assumption concerning the 'But-for' scenario that the Claimants were by definition entitled to make. The very purpose of the commitment in RD 661/2007 was to enable qualified investors who were registered under the RD 661 regime to remove the future income flow deriving their investment from the realm of pure speculation and to make it at least approximately predictable.\n\n353.\n\nFurthermore, there is a question of practical justice. The Claimants are claiming not only in respect of tariffs that would have been paid up to the date of the Award in this case but also in respect of payments of tariffs that have yet to fall due. That is implicit in the concept of the loss of the present value of investments caused by the 2013-2014 reforms, for which they claim. While it is theoretically arguable that it should not be assumed that future payments by the Respondent will be below the FIT level to which it has found the Claimants are entitled, that is the practical reality and is the basis on which both Parties have approached the case. There is no reason to suppose that the current Spanish law might be amended to provide for the payment in future of what would be the exceptional tariffs the Claimants in this case had a right to expect. The claim must be settled now by the payment of appropriate compensation. That, too, points to a focus upon redressing the failure to maintain the payment regime in RD 661/2007.\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal has no right to decide the dispute *ex aequo et bono.* It must identify the basis upon which reparation is to be determined, and then decide as best it can what sum constitutes adequate compensation. It does so on the basis of the fundamental principle on which the Parties and the practice of tribunals in ISDS cases are agreed: that is, the respondent is liable to compensate the claimant for the damage that the claimant can show was caused by the breach(es) by the respondent of a legal duty that the respondent owed to the claimant. (It is to be noted that the liability is not for all 'damage' resulting from conduct of the respondent, but only for damage resulting from conduct that constitutes a breach of the respondent's obligations to the claimant.) That combination of basic principles relating to causation and to the evidential burden in arbitration604 must be the starting point.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Gemplus, S.A., SLP, S.A. and Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States, ICSID Cases Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4, Award, 16 June 2010, \u00b6 12.56 (RL-0109).\n\n355.\n\nIn the present case the breach has been found to be constituted by the repudiation of the commitment by Spain to maintain the stability of features of the regulatory regime established by RD 661/2007, under which the Claimants' PV facilities were registered.605 Those features were the Feed-In Tariffs for PV plants, fixed and index-linked. Those tariffs were initially applicable for 25 years, with 80% of the tariff payable thereafter for the remainder of the operational life of the facility. That scheme was modified in 2010 by ending the right to 80% of the tariff after 25 years606 and extending the period for which 100% of the fixed tariff was payable to 28 years and later to 30 years, also capping the number of hours each year for which the tariff was payable.607\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 14; Cl. SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\nRD 1565/2010 (C-129).\n\nThe Claimants noted that \"[t]he permanent hours cap was established at a threshold that many plants would never reach [\u2026]\". Cl Reply, \u00b6 350, fn. 491.\n\n356.\n\nIt is the repudiation of that pre-determined payment system by the introduction of the New Regulatory Regime in 2014 that constitutes the breach of the DSG Claimants' rights in this case. The Tribunal has decided that 21 June 2014, the date of the completion of the New Regulatory Regime identified by the Claimants,608 is to be taken as the date of that breach. The Tribunal has found no other compensable breach of the DSG Claimant's rights under the ECT.\n\nCl. Opening Presentation, slide 112.\n\n357.\n\nIt follows that the measure of compensation is in principle the difference between the amount actually paid or payable to the Claimants for their electricity and the amount that would have been paid to the Claimants if key commitments in the regulatory regime under RD 661/2007, on the basis of which they made their investments, had been maintained as represented by the Respondent.\n\n358.\n\nThe investments at the heart of the present case are remarkably homogenous and made in a short period of time. They were made in three PV projects over a matter of months in 2008, and all were registered under the regime established by RD 661/2007. The PV plants still have some years of working life. In these circumstances, the Tribunal sees no reason why the compensation should not be set as an amount corresponding to the difference between the 'actual' tariffs and the RD 661/2007 'But-for' tariffs, calculated as its value on 21 June 2014.\n\n359.\n\nIf the tariffs due under RD 661/2007 had been paid (and continued to be paid) for the requisite period, the Claimants would have had no claim to any further compensation from the Respondent. Any additional effects upon contractual arrangements among the Claimants themselves would have been the result not of commitments made by the Respondent but of commitments made by the Claimants. Accordingly, the Tribunal declines to award any additional compensation in respect of the 'contractual' claims: i.e., the claims made in respect of bonus payments that would have been due under management and land rental contracts and the put and call options possessed by the real estate lessors.609 The approach to compensation adopted here also obviates the need to consider the impact of other factors addressed in the expert reports, including the (non-justiciable) 7% tax, adjustments to OPEX costs, the operational lifetime of plants, and cash collection problems. Similarly, there will be no gross-up for taxes.610\n\nFirst Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 156-157; Second Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 69-72\n\nFirst Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 184-186.\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the 2010 modifications did not breach the ECT. It is accordingly the RD 661/2007 regime as modified by the 2010 reforms that is to be applied in calculating the damages due: i.e., with the fixed tariff payable for a total period of 30 years, and no fixed tariff payable thereafter, and the total number of hours each year for which the fixed tariff is payable capped in accordance with RDL 14/2010 but with no overall limitation on the rate of return achieved by each PV plant.\n\n361.\n\nInterest from the date of the breach, 21 June 2014, up to the date of this Decision is payable. The Tribunal considers that as the Claimants incur no element of risk in relation to this payment it is appropriate to use Spain's borrowing rate,611 and to award compound interest in accordance with what is now the established practice in investment tribunals.612 It accepts the argument of Claimant's experts that the rate should be 1.16%, based on the average yield on Spanish Government 10-year bonds at June 2016, and compounded on a monthly basis.613 'Post-Award interest' is payable on the amount awarded at the same rate, and will be payable from the date of this Decision.\n\n*See* First Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 178-183.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the submissions of the Claimants on this point: Cl Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 514-524.\n\nFirst Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6 183, fn. 138.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal has studied the expert reports that have been submitted both by the Claimants and by the Respondent in this case, in an attempt to identify the basis for calculating the compensation due. It has not found that figure in those reports; nor has it found data from which that figure can confidently be calculated or approximated. Accordingly, the Tribunal remits this calculation to the Parties and their respective experts, to be made on the basis of the principles set in paragraphs 356-361 above, which the Tribunal has decided will afford appropriate compensation to the DSG Claimants. The Tribunal has decided that the calculation is to be based upon the data that formed the basis of the First Brattle Quantum Report,614 including the data on MWhs of electricity production,615 discount rates, and inflation. That data reflects the DSG Claimants' expectations on matters such as electricity production, and has proved to be a reasonable estimate.616\n\nAnd in particular Tordesillas Financial Models (BQR-070), Calasparra Financial Models (BQR-071) and Alcolea Financial Models (BQR-072).\n\nFirst Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 54-59.\n\nFirst Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6 54.\n\n363.\n\nThe Parties are requested to consult and to report to the Tribunal within 60 days of the date of this Decision on an agreed sum of compensation payable to each of the 73 DSG Claimants in accordance with the principles set out above, including the interest payable up to the date of this Decision. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree upon such sums, each Party shall within the same 60 days of the date of this Decision submit its own estimate together with a very brief summary of the reasons for its inability to agree with the other Party upon the quantum of compensation due. The Tribunal will determine the amount of compensation payable.\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal will then proceed to issue an Award incorporating this Decision and setting out the amount of compensation payable.\n\n365.\n\nThe Parties are requested to submit their respective detailed claims for costs along with the responses pursuant to paragraph 363 above on quantum, within the same 60-day period. They are invited to make brief written submissions on costs, addressing in particular the significance of the dismissal of the TS Claimants claims following the 'multi-party' objection. The Tribunal's decision on costs also will be set out in the Award.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n366.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal's earlier decisions on jurisdiction, set out in paragraph 326 (1) to (3) of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, are affirmed;617\n\n(2) The Tribunal has jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID Convention over all of the claims made by the DSG Claimants [see paragraphs 85-91, above];\n\n(3) The issues in dispute are to be decided in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law [see paragraph 82, above];\n\n(4) The Parties are invited to make their final submissions on costs, and the Tribunal will make its decision on costs in the Award, in accordance with paragraph 365 above.\n\nThe Tribunal decides by a majority as follows:\n\n(5) The Respondent has violated Part III of the ECT with respect to the Claimants' investments, and specifically the Respondent violated the rights of the DSG Claimants under Article 10 of the ECT to fair and equitable treatment by establishing the New Regulatory Regime [see paragraphs 211-225 and 303, above];\n\n(6) The Respondent is obliged to make reparation to the DSG Claimants in accordance with the principles stipulated in paragraphs 356-363 of this Decision;\n\n(7) The amount due to the DSG Claimants by way of reparation will be decided by the Tribunal and set out in an Award, in accordance with paragraphs 363 and 364 above.\n\nProfessor Douglas KC has delivered a Partial Dissenting Opinion, appended to this Decision.\n\nParagraph 326 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility is set out at paragraph 4, above."}]}
