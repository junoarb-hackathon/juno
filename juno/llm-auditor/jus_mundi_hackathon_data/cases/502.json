Subject matter of this Order**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present order deals with a request for provisional measures, by which Burlington Resources Oriente Limited (\"Burlington Oriente\"; to the exclusion of the other Claimants in this arbitration) seeks the following relief from the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(i) that Ecuador and PetroEcuador and/or their agencies or entities refrain from demanding payment of amounts allegedly due under Law No. 2006-42 and commencing any action or adopting any resolution or decision that may directly or indirectly lead to the forced or coerced payment of any amount relating to Law No. 2006-42;\n\n(ii) that Ecuador and PetroEcuador and/or their agencies or entities refrain from making or implementing any measure, decision or resolution which directly or indirectly affects the legal situation of or is intended to terminate the Block 7 and 21 PSCs; and\n\n(iii) that Ecuador and PetroEcuador and/or their agencies or entities refrain from engaging in any other conduct that aggravates the dispute between the parties and/or alters the status quo, including commencing any action or adopting any resolution or decision that directly or indirectly affects the legal or physical integrity of Burlington Oriente's representatives.\n\n**B. Origin of the dispute**\n----------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe present dispute originates from two production sharing contracts (\"PSCs\") for the exploration and exploitation of oil fileds in the Amazon Region. The first contract relates to Block 7. It was concluded on 23 March 2000 between Kerr McGee Ecuador Energy Corporation, Preussag Energie GMBH, Sociedad Internacional Petrolera S.A., Compa\u00f1\u00eda Latinoamericana Petrolera Numero Dos S.A., on the one hand and the Republic of Ecuador (\"Ecuador\") by the intermediary of Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (\"PetroEcuador\"), on the other hand (the \"Block 7 PSC\"). The second contract relates to Block 21. It was concluded on 20 March 1999 between Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Santa Fe Minerales del Ecuador S.A., Sociedad Internacional Petrolera S.A. and Compa\u00f1\u00eda Latinoamericana Petrolera S.A., on the one hand, and Ecuador by the intermediary of PetroEcuador, on the other hand (the \"Block 21 PSC\"). Burlington Resources Oriente Limited (\"Burlington Oriente\") alleges that it now holds a 42.5% interest in the Block 7 PSC and a 46.25% interest in the Block 21 PSC, an allegation that remained unchallenged. Perenco Ecuador Limited (\"Perenco\") is the operator of Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n3.\n\nBoth PSCs contain tax stabilization clauses, a choice of Ecuadorian law, and an ICSID arbitration clause.\n\n4.\n\nAccording to its Article 6(2), the Block 7 PSC will expire on 16 August 2010. By contrast, pursuant to Articles 6(2)(5) and 6(3) of the Block 21 PSC, the period of exploitation for such PSC is twenty (20) years from the date of authorization of PetroEcuador, *i.e.* allegedly until 2021, being specified that by letter of 24 December 2008 (Exhibit C49) the Ministry of Energy and Mines invited Perenco to appoint a negotiating team for the early termination of Block 21 PSC (as confirmed by the Ministry's letter of 26 January 2009 - Exhibit E3).\n\n5.\n\nBurlington Oriente and Perenco formed a Consortium, which is responsible for the tax obligations derived from the PSCs.\n\n6.\n\nOn 19 April 2006, Ecuador enacted Law No. 2006-42 (\"Law 42\"), which amended the Hydrocarbons Law of Ecuador as follows:\n\n\"**[c]ontracting companies** having Hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation participation agreements in force with the Ecuadorian State pursuant to this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil which may correspond thereto according to their participation, in the event the actual monthly average selling price for the FOB sale of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the monthly average selling price in force at the date of subscription of the agreement expressed at constant rates for the month of payment, **shall grant the Ecuadorian State a participation of at least 50% over the extraordinary revenues caused by such price difference** (Exhibit C7, Article 2; emphasis added)\n\n7.\n\nDecrees Nos. 1583 (29 June 2006) and 1672 (13 July 2006) spelled out the method of calculation of such 50% participation. From the record, it appears that the \"*reference price*\" (that is \"*the monthly average selling price in force at the date of subscription of the agreement expressed at constant rates for the month of payment*\") is USD 25 per barrel for Block 7 (Transcript, p.163) and USD 15 per barrel for Block 21 (Exhibit C41). In other words, if \"*the actual monthly average selling price for the FOB sale of Ecuadorian crude oil* \" amounted for instance to USD 40, Ecuador's participation would be 50% of USD 15, *i.e.* USD 7.5, for Block 7 and 50% of USD 25, *i.e.* USD 12.5, for Block 21.\n\n8.\n\nOn 18 October 2007, Ecuador published Decree No. 662 (\"Decree 662\"; from here, any reference to Law 42 includes Decree 662 unless otherwise specified), which amended Decree No. 1672 and increased the participation on \"*extraordinary revenues*\" pursuant to Law 42 from 50 percent to 99 percent. Using the same example as in the preceding paragraph, Ecuador's participation would be 99% of USD 15, *i.e.* USD 14.85, for Block 7 and 99% of USD 25, *i.e.* 24.75, for Block 21 crude.\n\n9.\n\nFrom the enactment of Law 42 until June 2008, *i.e.* during eighteen months after the adoption of Law 42 and eight months after Decree 662, the Consortium made the payments due under these texts to the State (hereinbelow, the expression \"Law 42 payments\" will include payments under Decree 662, unless otherwise specified). Specifically, by June 2008, the Consortium alleges that it \"*had made Law No. 2006-42 payments for Block 7 and 21 to Ecuador in excess of US$396.5 million\"* (Request for provisional measures, para.25).\n\n10.\n\nThereafter, the Consortium ceased to make such payments to the Respondent. Instead, it deposited the monies owed under Law 42 (and Decree 662) in an alleged total amount of USD 327.4 million (USD 171.7 million for Block 7 and USD 155.7 million for Block 21) into two segregated accounts, over which it keeps control.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the decision of Burlington Oriente to reject Ecuador's proposal to amend the Block 7 and 21 PSCs, Ecuador allegedly threatened to seize assets of the Consortium in order to collect unpaid amounts relating to Law 42 and to terminate the Block 7 and Block 21 PSCs. Notices were served by PetroEcuador on Perenco (Exhibit C55), in order to collect monies in the amount of USD 327,467,447.00 million (for the entire Consortium).\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, Ecuador and PetroEcuador (through the Executory Tribunal of PetroEcuador) instituted so-called *coactiva* proceedings to enforce the payment of USD 327,467,447.00, corresponding to the Consortium's allegedly unpaid amounts under Law 42.\n\n13.\n\nOn 25 February 2009, PetroEcuador proceeded to serve its third notice of the *coactiva* process on Perenco, which filed an action before the Civil Judge of Pichincha against any further actions that could be taken within the *coactiva* process1.\n\nIt is unclear whether Perenco alone, or the whole Consortium (as stated by the Respondent, see para.40 of the Rejoinder) filed an action before the Ecuadorian courts.\n\n14.\n\nOn 3 March 2009, the *coactiva* administrative tribunal ordered the immediate seizure of all Block 7 and 21 crude production and cargos produced by Perenco **,** which decision was confirmed by the Civil Judge of Pichincha on 9 March 2009 (Exhibit C60).\n\n15.\n\nAt the hearing, Burlington Oriente asserted that the \"[coactiva judge] *elected to treat it* [the debt for payments under Law 42] *as if it was res judicata, and then went ahead, seized the assets, and auctioned off - and auctioned them off for payment.\"* (Transcript, pp.27-8). The Respondents did not rebut such statement. They had actually stated in a letter of 3 *March 2009 that \"steps have been, or will imminently be, taken by the 'coactivas judge' to seize certain assets in satisfaction of the debts claimed in C-55 to Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures\"*. Although no amounts were specified, there is no dispute that Ecuador has seized certain quantities of oil produced by Burlington. By contrast, it has not been shown that other assets such as production equipment have been seized.\n\n**C. Request for arbitration**\n------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 21 April 2008, Burlington Resources Inc., Burlington Oriente, Burlington Resources Andean Limited and Burlington Resources Ecuador Limited filed a Request for arbitration with ICSID. They asked for the following relief:\n\n\"(a) DECLARE that Ecuador has breached:\n\n(i) Article III of the Treaty [between the United States and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment] by unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures tantamount to expropriation with respect to Burlington's investments in Ecuador;\n\n(ii) Article II of the Treaty by failing to treat Burlington's investments in Ecuador on a basis no less favorable than that accorded nationals; by failing to accord Burlington's investments fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and treatment no less than that required by international law; by implementing arbitrary and discriminatory measures against Burlington's investments; and\n\n(iii) Each of the PSCs;\n\n(b) ORDER Ecuador: (i) to pay damages to Burlington for its breaches of the Treaty in an amout to be determined at a later stage in these proceedings, including payment of compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the effective and complete payment of the award of damages for the breach of the Treaty; and/or (ii) to specific performance of its obligations under the PSCs and pay damages for its breaches of the PSCs in an amount to be determined at a later stage in the proceedings, including interest at such a rate as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the complete payment of all damages for breach of the PSCs.\n\n(c) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n\n(d) ORDER Ecuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Burlington's legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID's other costs\".\n\n**D. Procedural history**\n-------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn 20 February 2009, Burlington Oriente filed a Request for provisional measures (the \"Request\").\n\n18.\n\nThe Request was accompanied by a number of exhibits, including a witness statement from Mr. Alex Martinez. It included a request for a temporary restraining order with immediate effect.\n\n19.\n\nOn 23 February 2009, the First Respondent (Ecuador) filed a response to the Claimant's request for a temporary restraining order. It in particular undertook \"*to serve prior notice on the Tribunal, granting enough time for the Tribunal to act as necessary, before it takes any measure that seeks to enforce the debts claimed in exhibit C-55 to the request for Provisional Measures\".* On the basis of this undertaking, the Tribunal considered that it could dispense with reviewing whether a temporary order with immediate effect was justified pending determination of the application for provisional measures.\n\n20.\n\nBurlington Oriente renewed its request for a temporary restraining order on 25 February 2009 alleging that the third *coactiva* notice had been given and that three days thereafter the Respondents could start seizing assets. The First Respondent replied on 26 February 2009 and reiterated its undertaking.\n\n21.\n\nOn 27 February 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal again resolved that there was no need to rule on Burlington Oriente's request in view of Ecuador's repeated assurances.\n\n22.\n\nOn 3 March 2009, Burlington Oriente again repeated its request for a temporary restraining order, owing to the alleged imminence of the seizures of Burlington Oriente's assets pursuant to two orders issued by the *coactiva* tribunal on 3 March 2009.\n\n23.\n\nOn 4 March 2009, the First Respondent filed a preliminary reply to Burlington Oriente's Request for provisional measures (the \"Preliminary Reply\").\n\n24.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, in light of the information received three days earlier, the Arbitral Tribunal recommended \"*that the Respondents refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the status quo until it decides on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures or it reconsiders the present recommendation, whichever is first.*\" In issuing such recommendation, the Arbitral Tribunal considered that the requirements of urgency and of necessity were met. It in particular considered that Burlington Oriente's right to have its interests effectively protected by way of provisional measures was sufficient to demonstrate necessity in the circumstances.\n\n25.\n\nThe First Respondent filed its Reply to Burlington Oriente's Request for provisional measures (the \"Reply\"), together with a Request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's recommendation of 6 March 2009, on 17 March 2009. On 25 March 2009, the Claimant filed a Reply to the First Respondent's request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's recommendation on 25 March 2009. The Arbitral Tribunal denied the First Respondent's request for reconsideration on 3 April 2009 on the ground that no changed circumstances called for reconsideration and that the hearing on provisional measures was to take place shortly thereafter.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants filed their Response to Ecuador's Replies to the Request for provisional measures on 27 March 2009 (the \"Response\") and the Respondent filed their Rejoinder to Burlington Oriente's Request for provisional measures on 6 April 2009 (the \"Rejoinder\").\n\n27.\n\nThe hearing on provisional measures took place on 17 April 2009 in Washington, D.C. It was attended by the following persons:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal*\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, President of the Tribunal\n\nProfessor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator\n\nProfessor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat*\n\nMr. Marco T. Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*Representing the Claimants*\n\nMs. Aditi Dravid, ConocoPhilips Company\n\nMr. Alex Mart\u00ednez, Burlington Resources Oriente Limited\n\nMr. Alexander Yanos, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMs. Noiana Marigo, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Viren Mascarenhas, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Javier Robalino-Orellana, P\u00e9rez Bustamante & Ponce Abogados C\u00eda Ltda.\n\n*Representing First Respondent Republic of Ecuador*\n\nMr. Alvaro Galindo Cardona, Director de Patrocinio Internacional Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado\n\nMr. Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez, Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado\n\nMr. Felipe Aguilar, Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado\n\nMr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Dechert LLP\n\nMr. George K. Foster, Dechert LLP\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, Dechert LLP\n\n*Representing Second Respondent PetroEcuador*\n\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Murillo Venegas, Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador\n\nDr. Wilson Narv\u00e1ez, Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal heard the Parties' oral arguments as well as the testimony of Mr. Martinez. A transcript was made in English and Spanish and distributed to the Parties.\n\n**II. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the test to be applied to provisional measures is twofold: urgency and necessity to spare significant harm to a Party's rights.\n\n29.\n\nIt understands the first requirement of urgency in a broad fashion that includes situations in which protection cannot wait until the award. In the present case, it submits that urgency arises out of the Respondents' plan to enforce all amounts due under Law 42.\n\n30.\n\nWith respect to necessity, the Claimant stresses that the distinction between \"significant\" and \"irreparable\" harm does not entail consequences in the present case. According to the Claimant, irreparable harm is not required under the ICSID Convention or international law, and a broad meaning has been given to the phrase by a number of international tribunals (*Paushok v. Mongolia*, *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, *Saipem v. Bangladesh*). It further submits that ICSID arbitral tribunals have interpreted \"*necessity*\" for provisional measures not so much as a need to prevent \"*irreparable*\" harm but as a need to spare \"*significant harm*\". According to the Claimant, ICSID tribunals have also given careful consideration to the proportionality of the measures when considering if they are necessary.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant argues that necessity exists here in three respects:\n\n(i) Provisional measures are necessary to preserve the Claimant's rights under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules pursuant to which \"[...] *once the parties have consented to ICSID arbitration, they cannot resort to other forums in respect to the subject matter of the dispute before the ICSID Tribunal.\"* (Response, para.32). The Claimant contends that through the *coactiva* proceedings, the Respondents seek provisional relief against it in contravention to the said rights.\n\n(ii) Provisional measures are necessary to protect Burlington Oriente's independent right to specific performance of the Block 7 and 21 PSCs. The right to specific performance exists under Ecuadorian law, as provided by Article 1505 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code and confirmed by the Supreme Court of Ecuador in the case of *Tecco v. IEOS*. The Claimant also argues that Burlington Oriente's right to specific performance would not survive termination of the PSCs and that it is a property right that deserves protection to prevent its dissipation or destruction. The Claimant substantially argues that the Respondents' measures will irreversibly end Burlington Oriente's actual right to seek specific performance of the PSCs by effectively terminating them.\n\n(iii) Provisional measures are necessary to protect Burlington Oriente's self-standing rights to the preservation of the *status quo*, non-aggravation of the dispute, and preservation of the award. These rights are in danger of being irreparably harmed by the actions of the Respondents. In particular, according to the Claimant, the enforcement of Law 42 would alter the *status quo* and aggravate the dispute, as well as frustrate the effectiveness of the award, particularly of an award of specific performance.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimant adds that its request for provisional measures not only responds to the necessity criterion, but also fulfills the proportionality requirement. They point out that \"[s]*ince Ecuador has not enforced Law No. 2006-42 since June 2008, when the* Consortium *began depositing it into a segregated account, no additional burden would be imposed upon Ecuador if the Tribunal authorized the Consortium or Burlington Oriente to continue paying such amounts into a segregated account or into an official escrow account.\"* (Request, para.74).\n\n33.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal further notes the statement made by Mr. Alex Martinez, a member of the Board of Directors for Burlington Oriente and Latin America Partnership Operations and Peru Opportunity Manager for ConocoPhillips Corporation, according to whom *\"[i]f Ecuador indeed seizes the production assets of the Perenco-Burlington Oriente Consortium and/or the oil produced by the consortium, Burlington Oriente will be forced to exit Blocks 7 and 21 as it will be forced in this context to spend money to produce oil for the sole benefit of PetroEcuador\"* (Witness Statement of Alex Martinez, para.10).\n\n**B. Respondents' position**\n----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIn its Preliminary Reply, Reply and Rejoinder, the First Respondent (Ecuador) set out its arguments against the Claimant *'* s Request. The Second Respondent (PetroEcuador) stated in its letters of 31 March, 2 *and 6 April 2009 that it opposed the Claimant'* s Request and agreed with the position of the Republic of Ecuador, as expressed in the submissions just referred to. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal will thereafter refer to the position expressed in the First *Respondent's* submissions as that of both Respondents (on the admissibility of PetroEcuador's opposition to the Request, see para.43).\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondents state at the outset of their submissions that the Claimant's acts against the enforcement of a valid Ecuadorian law constitute an interference with the sovereignty of Ecuador. They further contend that a presumption of validity exist in favor of legislative measures adopted by a State, that any loss might be compensated by an award of damages and interest, and that the Claimant admits that it could meet its obligations to pay the disputed amounts, since it stated to have set aside the relevant amounts in U.S. accounts. The Respondents also state that the Claimant's Request is neither urgent nor necessary.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondents stress that the applicable test for granting provisional measures is the existence of an urgent need to avoid irreparable prejudice, in accordance with ICJ practice. In particular, they stress that no ICSID tribunal has ever rejected the criterion of \"*irreparable*\" harm to the benefit of \"*significant*\" harm. They further state that Burlington Oriente's reliance on *Paushok v. Mongolia* and *City Oriente v. Ecuador* is misplaced, as in the latter case, irreparable harm was met on the facts and, in the former, the arbitral tribunal recognized that it went against the weight of authorities.\n\n37.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondents understand urgency as follows: \"[...] *action prejudicial to the rights of Burlington Oriente is likely to be taken before the Tribunal can finally decide on the merits of the dispute submitted to it*.\" (Preliminary Reply, para. 8). The Respondents also state that *\"Burlington Oriente's reliance on a so-called 'proportionality test' confuses the issue*\" (Preliminary Reply, para.52).\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondents do not see the need for protection against the termination of the PSCs as urgent, since Ecuador confirmed on 23 February 2009 to the Arbitral Tribunal that none of the Respondents had taken steps to this effect.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondents further opposed the Claimant's arguments asserting that Burlington Oriente has not identified any substantive right requiring preservation through provisional measures:\n\n(i) The *coactiva* process does not threaten the Claimants' rights under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Such process is an administrative not a judicial proceeding. Consequently, it does not involve the determination of any of the matters at issue in this arbitration. The only judicial proceedings before the Ecuadorian courts (namely the proceedings in front of the Civil Court of Pichincha) were initiated by the Claimants, and not by any of the Respondents.\n\n(ii) Burlington Oriente has no right to specific performance of the PSCs, let alone one that would be irreparably harmed absent provisional relief. It has not established that Ecuador actually intended to terminate the PSCs. To the contrary, the government \"***expressly disavowed** any such intention.\"* (Rejoinder, para.21, with emphasis). Even if Ecuador had such intent, Burlington Oriente would still have no right to specific performance under international law. As for Ecuadorian law, it does not recognize a right to specific performance when the subject matter of the obligation is contrary to the law, which would be the case here because the enforcement of the PSCs would breach Law 42. Moreover, there is no more basis for a tribunal to restrain a sovereign State from terminating a contract than to order a State to reinstate a contract after termination.\n\n(iii) The preservation of the *status quo*, the non-aggravation of the dispute, and the preservation of the effectiveness of the award are not free standing rights in international law, independent from contractual or treaty rights. The preservation of the *status quo* is one of the purposes to be served by preserving rights under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules by way of provisional measures. Even if it had a right to the preservation of the *status quo*, Burlington Oriente is the one who altered this *status quo* by ceasing to pay the amounts due to Ecuador. Finally, there is no risk that the enforcement of Law 42 aggravates the dispute or renders any future award ineffective, since the dispute can easily be resolved through a monetary award.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondents further argue that the Claimant *'s* allegations about a *threat to the physical and legal integrity of Burlington's representatives is* unparticularised and should therefore be rejected.\n\n**III. DISCUSSION**\n-------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal will first deal with some preliminary matters (A). Thereafter, it will address the standards applicable to provisional measures in general (B), before reviewing each such standards, *i.e*. the existence of right (C), urgency (D), and necessity or the need to avoid harm (E). It will finally deal with the issue of the escrow account (F) before setting forth its decision (IV).\n\n**A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will first deal with a few procedural issues which arose during the hearing of 17 April and in the course of previous written exchanges, namely the timeliness of PetroEcuador's opposition to the Request; Burlington Oriente's use of an alleged statement by President Correa; and the request for relief regarding the alleged threat to the legal and physical integrity of the Claimant's representatives.\n\n43.\n\nBurlington Oriente argues that PetroEcuador's endorsement of Ecuador's position on 31 March 2009 (confirmed on 1 and 6 April 2009 and repeated at the hearing, Transcript, p.9) was untimely and should thus not be considered. PetroEcuador attended the hearing without presenting oral argument of its own in accordance with the Tribunal's understanding set out in the latter's letter of 8 April 2009. Since PetroEcuador made no written or oral submissions of its own, but for its adhesion to Ecuador's case, the fact that such adhesion did not respect the briefing schedule did not affect the Claimant's due process rights. The Tribunal would thus find it excessively formalistic to disregard PetroEcuador's endorsement of the First Respondent's position.\n\n44.\n\nAs a second preliminary matter, the Respondents object to Burlington Oriente's reliance at the hearing on a statement by President Correa in 2008 (Transcript, p.21). Since evidence of such a statement was not in the record then, the Arbitral Tribunal will not consider it for purpose of this decision.\n\n45.\n\nAs a third preliminary matter, the Respondents submit that Burlington Oriente's request for relief based on the threat to the legal and physical integrity of its representatives has been abandoned (Transcript, pp.90-91). The Arbitral Tribunal indeed notes that Burlington Oriente has not opposed such submission at the hearing. Be this as it may, the allegation of threats is in any event unsubstantiated Hence, the Tribunal will not further entertain it.2\n\n*See,* for a similar approach, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on provisional measures of 17 August 2007, para. 89: \"In other words, Claimants are asking a provisional measure in order to avoid a behaviour, which they are not even sure to be intended. This is not the purpose of a provisional measure. Provisional measures are not deemed to protect against any potential and hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain measures, they are deemed to protect the requesting party from an imminent harm.\"\n\n46.\n\nAs a final observation within these preliminary matters, the Tribunal notes that this order is made on the basis of its understanding of the record as it stands now. Nothing herein shall preempt any later finding of fact or conclusion of law.\n\n**B. APPLICABLE STANDARDS**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Legal framework**\n----------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe relevant rules are found in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which are generally considered to grant wide discretion to the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n48.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides that\n\n\"[e]xcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the specific rights of either party.\"\n\n49.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules reads as follows:\n\n(1) \"At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n[...]\"\n\nIt is undisputed by the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal has the power to order provisional measures prior to ruling on its jurisdiction. The Tribunal will not exercise such power, however, unless there is prima facie basis for jurisdiction.\n\n50.\n\nThe provisional measures were requested by Burlington Oriente, *i.e.* one of the so-called *\"Burlington subsidiaries\"* (Request for Arbitration, para.1). The \"*Burlington subsidiaries*\" (that is Burlington Oriente, Burlington Resources Ecuador Limited and Burlington Resources Andean Limited) seek compensation for the Respondents' breach of the PSCs (Request for Arbitration, para.3). As far as Burlington's subsidiaries are concerned, the Claimants assert that ICSID has jurisdiction on the basis of the arbitration clauses embodied in Section 20.3 of the Block 7 PSC and Section 20.2.19 of the Block 21 PSC:\n\n\"By the express language of the PSCs for Blocks 7, 21 and 23, the parties consented to ICSID jurisdiction from the moment the ICSID Convention was ratified by Ecuador. Ecuador ratified the ICSID Convention on February 7, 2001. Thus, since February 7, 2001, all parties to the PSCs for Blocks 7, 21 and 23 have consented to ICSID arbitration to resolve the dispute set forth herein.\" (Request for Arbitration, para.131).\n\nHence, the Tribunal considers that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction for purposes of rendering this order.\n\n**2. Requirements for provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThere is no disagreement between the Parties, and rightly so, that provisional measures can only be granted under the relevant rules and standard if rights to be protected do exist (C below), and the measures are urgent (D below) and necessary (E below), this last requirement implying an assessment of the risk of harm to be avoided by the measures. By contrast, the Parties differ on the nature of such harm. The Claimant argues that significant harm is sufficient, while the Respondents insist on irreparable harm. The Parties further disagree on the type and existence of the rights to be protected. The Tribunal will now review the different requirements for provisional measures just set out and the Parties' divergent positions in this respect.\n\n**C. EXISTENCE OF RIGHTS**\n--------------------------\n\n52.\n\nBurlington Oriente asserts that three types of rights need protection by way of provisional measures, namely the right to exclusive recourse to ICSID under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention (1); the rights to the preservation of the *status quo*, the non-aggravation of the dispute and the effectivity of the arbitral award (2); and the right to specific performance of the PSCs (3).\n\n53.\n\nAt the outset, one notes the Parties' concurrent view that the Tribunal must examine the existence of rights under a *prima facie* standard (Transcript, p.169, 179-80, 199). It cannot require actual proof, but must be satisfied that the rights exist *prima facie*.\n\n**1. Right to exclusivity under Article 26 ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIn the first place, Burlington Oriente substantially argues that provisional measures are necessary to preserve the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which in essential part provides that \" [c]*onsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\"*\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant submits that matters at issue in the present case are being adjudicated in the *coactiva* process. The Respondents reply that the *coactiva* proceeding is an administrative not a judicial process, that it carries no *res judicata*, and does not preempt the determination of the dispute by this Tribunal.\n\n56.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, two questions arise here. First, does a right to the exclusive jurisdiction of ICSID exist as a right that can be protected through provisional measures? If the answer is positive, the second question that arises is whether that right is at risk under the circumstances if no provisional measures are granted.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt about the existence of a right to exclusivity susceptible of protection by way of provisional measures, or in the words of the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine* tribunal:\n\n\"Among the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy, whether domestic or international, judicial or administrative.\"3\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18), Order No. 3 of 18 January 2005, para. 7, citation omitted.\n\n58.\n\nThe existence of such a right being accepted, is the continuation of the *coactiva* process susceptible of putting this right at risk? There is conflicting argumentation on record about the true legal nature and the subject matter of the *coactiva* process (Transcript, pp. 26-7, 49-63, 11630). The Tribunal is thus unable to come to a conclusion on this issue in the context of this Order. Hence, for purposes of the present limited review, it cannot but hold that Burlington Oriente has not established a *prima facie* case of breach of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**2. Right to the preservation of the** ***status quo*** **and non-aggravation of the dispute**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nSecond, Burlington Oriente asserts rights to the preservation of the *status quo*, the non-aggravation of the dispute, and the preservation of the award. The Respondents object that these are neither rights under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention nor free standing rights under international law and that the Claimant can only seek measures that protect the substantive rights in dispute.\n\n60.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are not limited to those which form the subject-matter of the dispute or *substantive* rights as referred to by the Respondents, but may extend to procedural rights, including the general right to the *status quo* and to the non-aggravation of the dispute. These latter rights are thus self-standing rights.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal will now review the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute. Such right focuses on the situation at the time of the measures. By contrast, the right to the protection of the effectivity of the award looks into the future. As such, under the circumstances of this case, it is closely linked with the right to specific performance. The discussion on such latter right, to which the Tribunal refers later in this Order, thus equally disposes of the issue of the protection of the award.\n\n62.\n\nThe existence of the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute is well-established since the case of the *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria*4. In the same vein, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention referred to the need \"*to preserve the status quo between the parties pending* [the] *final decision on the merits*\" and the commentary to the 1968 edition of the ICSID Arbitration Rules explained that Article 47 of the Convention \"*is based on the principle that once a dispute is submitted to arbitration the parties should not take steps that might aggravate or extend their dispute or prejudice the execution of the award*\"5.\n\n*Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belgium v. Bulgaria)*, Judgment of 5 December 1939, PCIJ series A/B, No 79, p.199. See also the *LaGrand case (Germany v. United States)*, Judgment of 27 June 2001, para. 103, ICJ Reports 2001, p.466.\n\n1 ICSID Reports 99.\n\n63.\n\nIn ICSID jurisprudence, this principle was first affirmed in *Holiday Inns v. Morocco*6 and then reiterated in *Amco v. Indonesia*. In the latter case, the tribunal acknowledged \"*the good and fair practical rule, according to which both Parties to a legal dispute should refrain, in their own interest, to do anything that could aggravate or exacerbate the same, thus rendering its solution possibly more difficult*\"7.\n\n*Holiday Inns S.A. and others v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1), Order of 2 July 1972, not public but commented in Pierre Lalive, \"The First 'World Bank'\" Arbitration (Holiday Inns v. Morocco) - Some Legal Problems\", BYIL, 1980.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on request for provisional measures of 9 December 1983, ICSID Reports, 1993, p.412.\n\n64.\n\nThe principle was re-affirmed in *Plama v. Bulgaria*8 (although with a somewhat more limited approach), *Occidental v. Ecuador*9, and *City Oriente v. Ecuador*10.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/04), Order of 6 September 2005, para. 40.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on provisional measures of 17 August 2007, para.96.\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21), Decision on provisional measures of 19 November 2007, para.55.\n\n65.\n\nThere is no doubt in the Tribunal's mind that the seizures of the oil production decided in the *coactiva* proceedings are bound to aggravate the present dispute. At present, both PSCs are in force and, subject to the controversy about the Law 42 payments, appear to be perfomed in accordance with their terms. If the seizures continue, it is most likely that the conflict will escalate and there is a risk that the relationship between the foreign investor and Ecuador may come to an end.\n\n66.\n\nIn making this finding, the Tribunal understands Ecuador's arguments about its duties to enforce its municipal law and in particular Law 42. Yet, the ICSID Convention allows an ICSID tribunal to issue provisional measures under the conditions of Article 47. Hence, by ratifying the ICSID Convention, Ecuador has accepted that an ICSID tribunal may order measures on a provisional basis, even in a situation which may entail some interference with sovereign powers and enforcement duties.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful of the Respondents' argument that Burlington Oriente is the one who altered the *status quo* by ceasing to pay the amounts due to Ecuador. It cannot, however, follow this argument. Indeed, the *status quo* at issue, the one that needs protection - provided the other requirements are met - consists in the continuation of the cooperation between the Parties in the framework of the PSCs.\n\n68.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal holds that Burlington Oriente has shown the existence of a right to preservation of the *status quo* and the nonaggravation of the dispute.\n\n**3. Right to specific performance (and to the preservation of the effectivity of the award)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThird, the Claimant asserts a right to specific performance of the PSCs and to the protection of the effectivity of an award that may sanction such right. It is disputed whether specific performance is admissible under Ecuadorian and international law.\n\n70.\n\nWith respect to international law, Article 35 of the ILC Articles on State responsibility provide for restitution which includes specific performance unless it is materially impossible or wholly disproportionate11. Whether specific performance is impossible or disproportionate is a question to be dealt with at the merits stage. It is true that the view has been expressed that the right to specific performance is not available under international law where a concession agreement for natural resources has been terminated or cancelled by a sovereign State. In the instant case, the PSCs are in force which makes it unnecessary to consider that view. As far as Ecuadorian law is concerned, it appears to provide for the remedy of specific performance pursuant to Article 1505 of the Civil Code.\n\nSee also e.g. *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of 12 May 2005, para.400: \"Restitution is the standard used to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided this is not materially impossible and does not result in a burden out of proportion as compared to compensation.\"\n\n71.\n\nAccordingly, at first sight at least, a right to specific performance appears to exist. Some other factual and legal elements seem to support the possibility of specific performance: (i) Burlington Oriente's claim for specific performance is a contract, not a treaty claim; (ii) the PSCs are still being perfomed, and (iii) they contain a choice of Ecuadorian law and a tax stabilization clause. Thus, at least *prima facie*, a right to specific performance could exist in the present situation. Under the circumstances, the same can be said of the right to the protection of the effectivity of a possible future award.\n\n**D. URGENCY**\n--------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Parties agree that there is urgency when it is impossible to wait until the award because actions prejudicial to the rights of the petitioner are likely to be taken before the Arbitral Tribunal decides on the merits of the dispute. They disagree, however, on whether the present facts meet the urgency requirement. The Respondents in particular submit that the threat of termination of the PSCs does not create an urgent situation as Ecuador has confirmed to the Tribunal on 23 February 2009 that the Respondents had taken no steps to this effect.\n\n73.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees that the criterion of urgency is satisfied when, as Schreuer puts it, \"*a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits*\"12. This is in line with ICJ practice13. The same definition has also been given in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* :\n\n\"In the Arbitral Tribunal's view, the degree of 'urgency' which is required depends on the circumstances, including the requested provisional measures, and may be satisfied where a party can prove that there is a need to obtain the requested measures at a certain point in the procedure before the issuance of an award.\"14\n\nChristoph SCHREUER, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 751 (para.17).\n\nIn the words of the ICJ, \"[w]hereas the power of the Court to indicate provisional measures will be exercised only if there is urgency in the sense that there is a real risk that action prejudicial to the rights of either party might be taken before the Court has given its final decision (see, for example, *Passage through the Great Belt (Finland v. Denmark)*, Provisional Measures, Order of 29 July 1991, ICJ Reports 1991, p. 17, para.23; *Certain Criminal Proceedings in France (Republic of the Congo v. France)*, Provisional Measures, Order of 17 June 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, p. 107, para.22 *; Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)*, Preliminary Objections, Order of 23 January 2007, p. 11, para.32), and whereas the Court thus has to consider whether in the current proceedings such urgency exists\", Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Order of 15 October 2008, para.129.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Procedural Order No. 1 of 31 March 2006, para.76.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Respondents' opinion that no urgency arises from the alleged threat of termination of the PSCs. The urgency lies elsewhere and is closely linked to the non-aggravation of the dispute discussed in the preceding section, to which the Tribunal refers. Indeed, when the measures are intended to protect against the aggravation of the dispute during the proceedings, the urgency requirement is fulfilled by definition15.\n\nOf the same opinion, in particular, City Oriente, Decision on Provisional Measures, para.69.\n\n**E. NECESSITY OR NEED TO AVOID HARM**\n--------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Parties concur that the measures must be necessary or in other words that they must be required to avoid harm or prejudice being inflicted upon the applicant. They differ, however, on the required intensity of the harm: \"*irreparable*\", *i.e*. not compensable by money, for the Respondents, as opposed to \"*significant*\" for the Claimant.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondents substantially argue that the harm invoked by Burlington Oriente cannot be deemed \"*irreparable*\" because (i) no production assets were seized and (ii) such harm can easily be made good by a monetary award. They rely in particular on *Occidental Petroleum and other v. Ecuador* to argue that \"*a mere increase in damages is not a justification for provisional measures\"* (Rejoinder, para.55).\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant does not dispute that no production assets were seized, but insists that its operational capacity is severely threatened by the seizures, that the imposition of the Law 42 payments led to a loss on investment in 2008 and prevented a sale of the latter (Testimony of Mr. Martinez, Transcript, pp.117-118 and 114). It also argues that it may have no other choice than to \"walk away\" from its investment.\n\n78.\n\nThe words \"necessity\" or \"harm\" do not appear in the relevant ICSID provisions. Necessity is nonetheless an indispensable requirement for provisional measures. It is generally assessed by balancing the degree of harm the applicant would suffer but for the measure.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondents are right in pointing out that a number of investment tribunals have required irreparable harm in the sense of harm not compensable by monetary damages. The *Occidental* tribunal found that there was no irreparable harm since the Claimants' harm, if any, could be compensated by a monetary award16. In the same vein, the *Plama* tribunal mentioned that it accepted the respondent's argument that the harm was not irreparable if it could be compensated by damages17, but did not discuss the matter further. Similarly, the tribunal in *Metaclad v. Mexico* denied the request and underlined that the measures must be required to protect the applicant's rights from \"*an injury that cannot be made good by subsequent payment of damages*\"18.\n\nOccidental, para.92.\n\nPlama, para.46.\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Decision on a request by the Respondent for an order prohibiting the Claimant from revealing information regarding ICSID Case ARB(AF)/97/1, para.8.\n\n80.\n\nBy contrast, the *City Oriente* tribunal distinguished its case from investment cases where the sole relief sought was damages, while *City Oriente* was seeking contract performance19. In its decision not to revoke the measures, the tribunal stressed that neither Article 47 of the ICSID Convention nor Arbitration Rule 39 \"*require that provisional measures be ordered only as means to prevent irreparable harm*\"20. In the UNCITRAL investment case of *Paushok v. Mongolia*, the tribunal distinguished *Plama*, *Occidental* and *City Oriente* and concluded that \"*irreparable harm*\" in international law has a \"*flexible meaning*\". It also referred to Article 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law which only requires that \"*harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measures are not ordered*\"21.\n\nCity Oriente, Decision on Revocation, para.86.\n\nIbid., para.70.\n\nPaushok, paras.62, 68-69.\n\n81.\n\nHowever defined, the harm to be considered does not only concern the applicant. The *Occidental* tribunal recalled that the risk of harm must be assessed with respect to the rights of both parties. Specifically, it stated that \"*provisional measures may not be awarded for the protection of the rights of one party where such provisional measures would cause irreparable harm to the rights of the other party, in this case, the rights of a sovereign State*\".22 In the same spirit, the *City Oriente* tribunal stressed the need to weigh the interests at stake against each other. Referring to Article 17A(1) of the UNCITRAL Model Law, it emphasized the balance of interests that needs to be struck as follows:\n\n\" It is not so essential that provisional measures be necessary to prevent irreparable harm, but that the harm spared the petitioner by such measures must be significant and that it exceeds greatly the damage caused to the party affected thereby. \"23\n\nOccidental, para.93.\n\nCity Oriente, Decision on Revocation, para.72.\n\n82.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, this Tribunal finds it appropriate to follow those cases that adopt the standard of *\"harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages\"* to use the words of the UNCITRAL Model Law. It will also weigh the interests of both sides in assessing necessity.\n\n83.\n\nUnlike *Occidental*, this case is not one of only *\"more damages\"* caused by the passage of time24. It is a case of avoidance of a different damage. The risk here is the destruction of an ongoing investment and of its revenueproducing potential which benefits both the investor and the State. Indeed, if the investor must continue to finance operation expenses while making losses, from a business point of view it is likely that it will reduce its investment and maintenance costs to a minimum and thus its output and the shared revenues. There is also an obvious economic risk that it will cease operating altogether. While profit sharing may be legitimate, expecting that a foreign investor will continue to operate a loss making investment over years is unreasonable as a matter of practice. Contrary to the Respondents' assertion pursuant to which the protection would be *granted against the investor's own act of \"* wal *king away\"*, the Tribunal considers that the project and its economic standing is at risk regardless of the conduct of the investor.\n\nOccidental, para.99.the Claimant replies that it will not touch the monies on the segregated account, the objection is mathematically speaking correct. Yet, it misses the point. Indeed, the risk of further deterioration of the relationship possibly ending with the destruction of the investment would still exist. This is especially, but not exclusively so if the investor is liable to settle both the alleged past due Law 42 payments and the newly accruing ones (Transcript, p.195). The consequences of the end of the investment relationship would affect the investor as well as the State. The latter would then in effect lose future Law 42 payments if they are ultimately held to be due.\n\n84.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has paid due attention to the Respondents *'* argument that the effect of the seizures was economically neutral for the Claimant. Every time oil is seized for a given amount, past due Law 42 debts are extinguished, which would allow the Claimant to withdraw the equivalent amount from the segregated account. Although the Claimant replies that it will not touch the monies on the segregated account, the objection is mathematically speaking correct. Yet, it misses the point. Indeed, the risk of further deterioration of the relationship possibly ending with the destruction of the investment would still exist. This is especially, but not exclusively so if the investor is liable to settle both the alleged past due Law 42 payments and the newly accruing ones (Transcript, p.195). The consequences of the end of the investment relationship would affect the investor as well as the State. The latter would then in effect lose future Law 42 payments if they are ultimately held to be due.\n\n85.\n\nThis last observation shows that provisional measures are in the interest of both sides if they are adequately structured, a matter discussed in the next section.\n\n**F. ESCROW ACCOUNT**\n---------------------\n\n86.\n\nAs an alternative to its main request for relief, Burlington Oriente confirmed at the hearing that it could envisage an escrow account *\"where all the funds that are the subject of this dispute could be held pending its resolution\"* (Transcript, pp.23-24, esp. lines 16-18). The Arbitral Tribunal *notes the Respondents'* argument that such account would be *\"unmanageable and inadequate\"* (Transcript, p.211, line 12), since it would exclusively cover the Parties in this arbitration, notwithstanding the joint liability of the Consortium and also because an offshore escrow account would be *\"inimical to Ecuador\u2019s sovereignty\"* (Transcript, p.212, lines 4-5).\n\n87.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that the establishment of an escrow account would provide *a balanced solution likely to preserve each Party's* rights. The Republic of Ecuador would have the certainty that the amounts allegedly owing would be paid and could later be collected if held to be due. The investor would benefit from the cessation of the *coactiva* process, and although paying significant amounts into the escrow account, would have the assurance that such amounts could later be recovered if held not to be due. Moreover, in reliance on such assurances, one would reasonably expect both Parties to continue the performance of the PSCs under their terms.\n\n88.\n\nThe terms and conditions of the escrow account, and other practicalities call for a number of specifications:\n\n(i) The escrow account shall contain all future and past payments due under Law 42 and Decree 662. Past payments shall include all payments owed by the Claimant and payed into their segregated account. It appears that past payments (in the amount of USD 327.4 million) were made by the Consortium into two segregated U.S. accounts (one for each of the members of the Consortium, see Request, para.25). Therefore, even if the Consortium were jointly liable for its debts as the Respondents allege, the Claimant will be able to separate the payments owed by it from the payments owed by Perenco.\n\n(ii) The amounts deposited on the escrow account shall only be released in accordance with a final award, or a settlement agreement duly entered into by the Parties, or with other specific instructions issued by this Tribunal.\n\n(iii) The escrow agent shall be an internationally recognized financial institution. For reasons of neutrality, it shall not be an Ecuadorian, North American or Bermuda institution.\n\n(iv) Interest earned on the escrow account should be credited to such account and released in accordance with a final award, or a settlement agreement, or other instructions from this Tribunal.\n\n(v) The costs incurred by the escrow account shall be borne equally by both Parties but can be made part of the claim for compensation by each Party.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n[89].\n\nOn this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following order:\n\n1. The Parties shall confer and make their best efforts to agree on the opening of an escrow account at an internationally recognized financial institution incorporated outside of Ecuador, the United States of America and Bermuda;\n\n2. Burlington Oriente shall pay into the escrow account all future and past payments allegedly due under Law 42 and Decree 662, including all payments made by the Claimants into their segregated account;\n\n3. The funds in the escrow account shall only be released in accordance with a final award or a settlement agreement duly entered into by the Parties or with other specific instructions from this Tribunal;\n\n4. The costs of the escrow account shall be borne equally by both Parties and can be made part of the claim for compensation by each Party;\n\n5. The interest accrued on the escrow account shall be credited to such account and released in accordance with a final award, or a settlement agreement, or other instructions from this Tribunal;\n\n6. If the Parties cannot agree on the opening of an escrow account within 60 days from notification of this Order, they shall report to the Arbitral Tribunal setting forth the status of their negotiations and the content of and reasons for their disagreements after which the Arbitral Tribunal will rule on the outstanding issues;\n\n7. The Respondents shall discontinue the proceedings pending against the Claimant under the *coactiva* process and shall not initiate new *coactiva* actions;\n\n8. The Parties shall refrain from any conduct that may lead to an aggravation of the dispute until the Award or the reconsideration of this order. In particular, Burlington Oriente shall refrain from making good on its threat to abandon the project and Ecuador shall refrain from any action that may induce Burlington Oriente to do so;\n\n9. The Order issued by this Tribunal on 6 March 2009 is terminated;\n\n10. Costs are reserved for a later decision or award."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2010-06-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Bilateral Investment Treaty; specifically \"Treaty between the United States and Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments\" of 11 May 1997 |\n| CM | Burlington's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction of 20 October 2009 |\n| Exh.

FACTS RELEVANT TO JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to rule on Ecuador's objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**1. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n**1.1 The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant, Burlington Resources Inc. (\"Burlington\" or the \"Claimant\"), is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, founded in 1988, and focused on the exploitation of natural resources.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Alexander Yanos, Nigel Blackaby and Christopher Pugh of FRESHFIELDS BRUCKHAUS DERINGER; and by Jos\u00e9 M. P\u00e9rez and Javier Robalino-Orellana of P\u00c9REZ BUSTAMANTE & PONCE.\n\n**1.2 The Respondent**\n----------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador (\"Ecuador\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n and Dr. \u00c1lvaro Galindo Cardona from the Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado; and by Prof. Pierre Mayer, Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Mr. Philip Dunham and Mr. George K. Foster of DECHERT LLP.\n\n**2. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n**2.1 Background Facts**\n------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ecuador, wishing to revitalize its hydrocarbons industry, set in motion a series of bidding rounds aimed at stimulating greater involvement from private operators in this sector. As a result, between 1983 and 1993, Ecuador launched six bidding rounds for the granting of service contracts to private contractors (Exh. C-78).\n\n7.\n\nUnder the service contract model, the Government awards an exploration area (a \"Block\") to a private contractor, who undertakes to exploit any commercial oil reserves discovered in this area. The Government, in turn, covers the contractor's costs and pays in addition a fixed monthly fee. Most importantly, the Government remains the sole owner of the oil produced, and thus captures the higher revenues flowing from any increases in the price of oil (Exh. C-82).\n\n8.\n\nOver the course of the six bidding rounds, nonetheless, only a few bids were submitted. Private investors evinced little interest in the service contract model upon which these bidding rounds were predicated. Therefore, beginning in 1992, and in order to induce greater private investment, Ecuador set out to adopt a new legal framework for the oil industry based upon a different contract model: the production sharing contract (the \"PSC\") (Exhs. C-78, C-81).\n\n9.\n\nUnder the production sharing contract model, the private contractor assumes all the risks and costs of the exploration and exploitation of oil reserves in a designated area and, in exchange, has the right to receive a share of the oil produced (Exh. C-17).\n\n10.\n\nAccordingly, Ecuador introduced changes to its Constitution and to relevant legislation. In particular, on 29 November 1993, the Ecuadorian Congress passed an amendment to the country's hydrocarbons law (the \"Hydrocarbons Law\") which, together with its implementing Decree No. 1417, laid the foundations for a new legal framework based upon the PSC model (the \"Hydrocarbons Legal Framework\") (Exhs. C-13, C-15, C-78, C-85, C-88, C-89).\n\n11.\n\nOnce the new Hydrocarbons Legal Framework was in place, Ecuador launched two additional bidding rounds based upon the new PSC model: Round Seven, in January 1994, and Round Eight, in June 1995. Foreign investors were invited to bid at these two rounds (Exh. C-90).\n\n12.\n\nDuring Rounds Seven and Eight, Ecuador awarded to foreign investors PSCs for Blocks 21, 23 and 24. These PSCs were executed on the following dates: i) for Block 21, on 20 March 1995; ii) for Block 23, on 26 July 1996; and iii) for Block 24, on 27 April 1998 (Exhs. C-2, C-3, C-4).\n\n13.\n\nIn addition, on 23 March 2000, Ecuador agreed to modify the service contract for the exploration and exploitation of Block 7 into a PSC (Exh. C-1).\n\n**2.2 Burlington's Acquisition of Ownership Interests in Production Sharing Contracts**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nBeginning in 2000, Burlington started to acquire ownership interests in PSCs for the exploration and exploitation of oil reserves in Ecuador. Burlington acquired these ownership interests through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely: Burlington Resources Oriente Limited (\"Burlington Oriente\"), Burlington Resources Andean Limited (\"Burlington Andean\") and Burlington Resources Ecuador Limited (\"Burlington Ecuador\") (collectively, the \"Burlington Subsidiaries\") (RFA, \u00b6 1; Mem., \u00b6 1).\n\n15.\n\nIn particular, between 2000 and 2006, Burlington acquired, through the Burlington Subsidiaries, ownership interests in PSCs for the exploration and exploitation of oil reserves in four Blocks: 7, 21, 23 and 24. All four Blocks are located in the Ecuadorian Amazon Region, and each Block comprises an area of 200,000 hectares (Exhs. C-1 to C-4, C-21 to C-25).\n\n16.\n\nBurlington acquired its ownership interests in the PSCs according to the following sequence: i) for Block 7, 25% on 28 February 2002, 5% on 13 September 2002 and 12.5% on 2 October 2006; ii) for Block 21, 32.5% on 28 February 2002, 5% on 13 September 2002 and 8.75% on 2 October 2006; iii) for Block 23, 50% on 26 February 2003; and iv) for Block 24, 100% on 9 May 2000 (Exhs. C-111, C-114, C-117, C-119, C-122, C-131, C-132, C-134).\n\n17.\n\nAs a result of these acquisitions, Burlington holds the following ownership interests in Blocks 7, 21, 23 and 24:\n\n1) In Block 7: 42.5% ownership interest in the PSC held through its Burlington Oriente subsidiary; another company, Perenco, owns the remaining interest and is the operator of the Block.\n\n2) In Block 21: 46.25% ownership interest in the PSC held through its Burlington Oriente subsidiary; Perenco, owner of the remaining interest, is the operator of the Block.\n\n3) In Block 23: 50% ownership interest in the PSC held through its Burlington Andean subsidiary; another company, Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Combustible S.A. (\"CGC\"), owns the remaining interest and is the operator of the Block.\n\n4) In Block 24: 100% ownership interest held through its Burlington Ecuador subsidiary, operator of the Block (Exhs. C-22 to C-24, C-26, C-27, C-111, C-114, C-116 to C-119, C-120, C-121, C-130 to C-134).\n\n18.\n\nUnder the terms of the PSCs for Blocks 7, 21, 23 and 24, Burlington enjoys the following rights and guarantees:\n\n1) The right to a fixed participation in crude oil production and the right to freely dispose of this participation;\n\n2) A legal stabilization clause;\n\n3) Conditions of reasonable security for the performance of the PSCs;\n\n4) A tax indemnification clause1.\n\nWhile Burlington referred to this clause as a \"tax stabilization clause\" (Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 108-113), Ecuador preferred the expression \"renegotiation clause\" (Tr. 17:21-24). In light of the semantical disagreement, the Tribunal believes that the term \"tax indemnification clause\" adequately and neutrally reflects the nature of this clause. For this reason, the Tribunal will employ the expression \"tax indemnification clause\" or simply \"indemnification clause\" in this Decision.\n\n19.\n\nFirst, Burlington has the right to a fixed participation in crude oil production. Once the crude is produced in each of the fields, it is transported to the so-called Inspection and Delivery Center (\"IDC\"). At the IDC, the crude production is examined to ascertain its volume and quality, whereupon it is allocated between the State and the contractor in accordance with a formula established in each PSC (Exhs. C-1, C-2 and C-4 at Clause 3.3.5; Exh. C-2 at Clause 3.3.4).\n\n20.\n\nFollowing this allocation, the contractor becomes the owner of its participation in the crude production (the \"Contractor Production Participation\") and has the right to freely dispose of it (Exhs. C-1 to C-4 at Clause 10.1).\n\n21.\n\nSecond, the PSCs include legal stabilization clauses, i.e. provisions according to which Ecuadorian law in force at the time the contracts were executed governs the contractual relationship. Thus, Clause 22.1 of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 24, whose language is very similar to that of analogous clauses in the PSCs for Blocks 21 and 23, sets forth the following:\n\n\"Applicable Legislation: This Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and *laws in force at the time of its signature are understood to be incorporated by reference* (emphasis added)\" (Exh. C-3 at Clause 22.1).\n\n22.\n\nThird, Ecuador committed to provide contractors reasonable security for the performance of the PSCs (Exhs. C-1 at Clause 5.2.5, C-2 at Clause 5.6.1, C-3 and C-4 at Clause 5.2.6). In this vein, Clause 5.2.6 of the PSC for Block 23, for instance, provides that Ecuador shall:\n\n\"Provide conditions of reasonable security for the performance of the operations of this Contract.\" (Exh. C-3).\n\n23.\n\nFinally, the PSCs also feature three kinds of tax guarantees. Under the first tax guarantee, each PSC assures a ceiling on applicable taxes. Thus, for instance, the maximum income tax applicable is 25% for Blocks 7, 21 and 23, and 20% for Block 24 (Exhs. C-1 and C-3 at Clauses 11.2.3 and 11.2.4, C-2 at Clauses 11.2.1 and 11.2.2, and C-4 at Clause 11.2.3).\n\n24.\n\nThe second tax guarantee is the so-called \"tax indemnification clause.\" Under this clause, Ecuador undertakes to absorb the effect of any tax measure enacted after the execution of the PSCs that would have an impact on the economics of the PSCs, such as increases in tax rates or the creation of new taxes (Exhs. C-1 at Clause 11.12, C-2 at Clause 11.7, C-3 and C-4 at Clause 11.10). This protection is exemplified in the PSC for Block 7, which provides as follows:\n\n\"Modification to the tax system: In the event of a modification to the tax system or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract, which have an impact on the economics of this Contract, *a correction factor will be included in the production sharing percentages to absorb the impact of the increase or decrease in the tax* (emphasis added)\" (Exh. C-1, Clause 11.12).\n\n25.\n\nUnder the third tax guarantee, Ecuador pledged to exempt Burlington from paying any royalties or related fees in each of the PSCs (Exhs. C-1 and C-4 at Clause 11.9, and C-2 at Clause 11.6). By way of illustration, Clause 11.9 of PSC 24 states that:\n\n\"The Contractor\u2026is exempt from the payment of entry fees, surface rights, *royalties*, contributions to compensation projects and contributions to technological research\" (emphasis added) (Exh. C-4).\n\n**2.3 Origin of the Dispute**\n-----------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties arises out of the following two factual scenarios: 1) Ecuador's purported failure to protect Burlington's exploration and exploitation activities in Blocks 23 and 24 from local indigenous opposition, and 2) Ecuador's enactment of measures which, purportedly in breach of its contractual and Treaty obligations, unilaterally increased its participation under the PSCs on so-called \"unforeseen surpluses.\"\n\n*2.3.1 Dispute Concerning the Purported Lack of Security in Blocks 23 and 24*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nLocal indigenous communities residing in Blocks 23 and 24 were opposed to any oil exploration and exploitation activities within these Blocks.\n\n28.\n\nWhen the PSC for Block 24 was first awarded on 27 April 1998, the original private contractor, Arco, encountered resistance from local indigenous communities that opposed any exploration and exploitation activities in this Block. Arco, being unable to perform its obligations under the PSC, requested Ecuador's consent to declare the Block in *force majeure* (Exh. C-32).\n\n29.\n\nOn 9 April 1999, instead of declaring the Block in *force majeure*, Ecuador granted Arco a one-year suspension of its obligations under the PSC. It extended this suspension for a further six-month period on 6 April 2000. Hence, when Burlington Ecuador's acquisition in Block 24 became effective on 9 May 2000, its obligations under the PSC were suspended (Exh. C-32).\n\n30.\n\nOpposition from the indigenous communities, in the form of violent attacks and death threats, intensified following Burlington Ecuador's acquisition. Therefore, on 6 October 2000, and again on 30 October 2000, Burlington Ecuador requested that Block 24 be declared in *force majeure* (Exhs. C-142, C-144).\n\n31.\n\nOn 15 May 2001, Ecuador finally accepted the request and declared the Block to be in *force majeure*, thereby suspending Burlington Ecuador's performance under the PSC for the duration of this status (Exh. C-36).\n\n32.\n\nAt the same time, Burlington sought to negotiate and reach a settlement with the local indigenous communities opposing operations in Block 24. In order to break the impasse in the negotiations, Burlington requested on several occasions assistance from the Ecuadorian Government (Exhs. C-145 to C-150).\n\n33.\n\nEcuador, however, allegedly failed to support Burlington's initiative. As a result, the negotiations did not prosper and opposition from local indigenous communities persisted. To date, Block 24 continues to be in *force majeure* status (Exh. C-151).\n\n34.\n\nA similar situation obtained in Block 23. When Burlington Andean acquired its interest in the Block 23 PSC, the Block was already in *force majeure* on account of the opposition from local indigenous communities. Consequently, exploration activities, which had begun, were suspended.\n\n35.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Burlington Andean and its partner in the Block, CGC, sought to negotiate and reach a settlement with the indigenous communities opposing operations in Block 23. Negotiations, however, were encumbered by several attacks from members of indigenous groups, which included the destruction of the contractors' seismic study base, the setting on fire of their camp, and the kidnapping of several employees (Exh. C-156).\n\n36.\n\nAs a result of these episodes of violence, CGC, as operator of Block 23, requested assistance from Ecuador on several occasions. Ecuador, however, allegedly failed to provide Burlington Andean and CGC security to their installations, personnel and activities (Exhs. C-153 to C-156).\n\n37.\n\nIn light of the alleged lack of meaningful assistance, CGC and Burlington Andean eventually decided to suspend their activities in Block 23. To date, Block 23 continues to be in *force majeure* status.\n\n*2.3.2 Dispute Concerning Ecuador's Increased Participation Under the PSCs*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nOn 19 April 2006, the Ecuadorian Congress enacted Law No. 2006-42 (\" **Law 42** \"), which amended the Hydrocarbons Law as follows:\n\n\" **Participation of the State over non agreed or unforeseen surpluses from oil selling contracts. Contracting companies** having Hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation participation agreements in force with the Ecuadorian State pursuant to this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil which may correspond thereto according to their participation, in the event the actual monthly average selling price for the FOB sale of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the monthly average selling price in force at the date of subscription of the agreement expressed at constant rates for the month of payment, **shall grant the Ecuadorian State a participation of at least 50% over the extraordinary revenues caused by such price difference** [\u2026]\" (Exh. C-7, Article 2; emphasis added).\n\n39.\n\nIn other words, Law 42 imposed a participation of 50% over so-called \"non agreed or unforeseen surpluses from oil selling prices\" on private contractors having PSCs in force with Ecuador.\n\n40.\n\nIn accordance with Law 42 and its ulterior regulations contained in Decree No. 15832, subsequently replaced by Decree No. 16723, Ecuador's additional participation must be calculated as follows:\n\n1. First, the monthly average selling price of a barrel of oil at the time of its production must be calculated (the \"Currently Prevailing Price\");\n\n2. Second, the monthly average selling price of a barrel of oil at the time the relevant PSC was executed must be calculated (the \"Reference Price\");\n\n3. Third, if the Currently Prevailing Price exceeds the Reference Price, then the contractor must allocate 50% of that excess to the State for each barrel of oil produced in a given month.\n\nIssued on 29 June 2006.\n\nIssued on 13 July 2006.\n\n41.\n\nThe Reference Price for Blocks 7 and 21, that is, the price of a barrel of oil at the time the PSCs for those Blocks were executed, was roughly US$ 25 and US$ 15, respectively (C-178).\n\n42.\n\nTherefore, if the Currently Prevailing Price of a barrel of oil were, for instance, US$ 45, then the contractor should allocate to the State US$ 10 for each barrel of oil produced in Block 7 (50% of US$ 20, the amount by which the Currently Prevailing Price, US$ 45, exceeds the Reference Price, US$ 25) and US$ 15 for each barrel of oil produced in Block 21 (50% of US$ 30).\n\n43.\n\nBurlington Oriente, through a tax consortium created pursuant to Ecuadorian tax law, which mandated that partners in PSCs contracts should pay taxes jointly (the \"Block 7 and 21 Tax Consortium\"), paid the additional 50% participation for Blocks 7 and 21 under protest (Exhs. C-25, C-42, C-140).\n\n44.\n\nIn addition, by letters dated 18 December 2006, the Block 7 and 21 Tax Consortium formally protested against the additional participation imposed by Law 42, and requested Ecuador to absorb the effects of this additional participation in accordance with the tax indemnification provisions of the PSCs. Ecuador apparently did not respond to these letters (Exhs. C-11 and C-12).\n\n45.\n\nOn 18 October 2007, Ecuador published Decree No. 662 (\" **Decree 662** \"; henceforth, any reference to Law 42 also includes Decree 662, unless otherwise specified), which amended Decree No. 1672 and increased Ecuador's additional participation for \"non-agreed or unforeseen surpluses\" from 50 percent to 99 percent (Exh. C-10).\n\n46.\n\nAs a result, if the Currently Prevailing Price of a barrel of oil were as in the previous example US$ 45, then, under Decree 662, the contractor should allocate to the State US$ 19.8 for each barrel of oil produced in Block 7 (99% of US$ 20) and US$ 29.7 for each barrel of oil produced in Block 21 (99% of US$ 30).\n\n47.\n\nBurlington Oriente, through the Block 7 and 21 Tax Consortium, paid the additional 99% participation under protest (Exh. C-42).\n\n48.\n\nIn addition, by letters dated 28 November 2007, Burlington requested Ecuador to provide a written statement of its intent to abide by the tax indemnification provisions contained in the PSCs. Ecuador seemingly did not respond to these letters (Exh. C-43).\n\n49.\n\nBy June 2008, the Block 7 and 21 Tax Consortium had made Law 42 payments in excess of US$ 396.5 million (Mem., \u00b6 229).\n\n50.\n\nBy letter dated 19 June 2008, the Tax Consortium asked Ecuador whether it would agree that the disputed payments under Law 42 be made into an escrow account pending final adjudication of the dispute. Ecuador does not appear to have responded to this request. Thus, as of June 2008, the Tax Consortium decided to make all payments due under Law 42 into a segregated account (Exh. C-48).\n\n51.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, Ecuador instituted so-called *coactiva* domestic proceedings against Perenco, as operator of Blocks 7 and 21, to enforce payment of US$ 327.3 million allegedly owed by Block 7 and 21 operators under Law 42 (Exh. C-55).\n\n52.\n\nOn 3 March 2009, an Ecuadorian Executory Tribunal ordered the seizure of Block 7 and 21 oil crude production. On the basis of this decision, Ecuador began to seize and auction off oil crude production from Blocks 7 and 21 (Exh. C-58, C-64, C-65).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Initial Phase**\n--------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn 21 April 2008, Burlington, along with the Burlington Subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Initial Claimants\"), filed a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") against Ecuador and PetroEcuador (the \"Initial Respondents\"), enclosing forty-five exhibits therewith (Exhs. C-1 to C-45). In the Request, the Initial Claimants asked for the following relief:\n\n\"(a) DECLARE that Ecuador and PetroEcuador have breached the PSCs;\n\n(b) DECLARE that Ecuador has breached:\n\n(i) Article II of the Treaty by failing to observe its obligations with regard to Burlington's investments, by failing to accord Burlington's investments fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, and by implementing arbitrary and discriminatory measures against Burlington's investments; as well as\n\n(ii) Article III of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures tantamount to expropriation with respect to Burlington's investments in Ecuador;\n\n(c) ORDER Ecuador and PetroEcuador to specifically perform their obligations under the PSCs and pay damages for their breaches of the PSCs, and Ecuador to pay damages for its breaches of the Treaty\u2026.including payment of compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the effective and complete payment of the award of damages; or\n\n(d) In the event that Ecuador and PetroEcuador make future collaboration impossible, DECLARE the PSCs terminated and ORDER Ecuador and PetroEcuador to pay damages for their breaches of the PSCs and Ecuador to pay damages to Burlington for its breaches of the Treaty\u2026.including payment of compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the effective and complete payment of the award of damages;\n\n(e) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n\n(f) ORDER Ecuador and PetroEcuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Burlington's legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID's other costs\".\n\n54.\n\nOn 25 April 2008, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), transmitted a copy of the Request to Ecuador and PetroEcuador.\n\n55.\n\nOn 2 June 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or the \"Convention\"). On the same date, the Acting Secretary-General dispatched the Notice of Registration to the Parties and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an arbitral tribunal.\n\n56.\n\nPursuant to Rule 2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), the Initial Claimants, in the absence of agreement on another procedure between the Parties, elected the formula established in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the constitution of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n57.\n\nUnder Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, \"the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the president of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the parties.\" The Parties subsequently proceeded to appoint the members of the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the terms of this provision.\n\n58.\n\nOn 4 August 2008, the Initial Claimants appointed Prof. Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a Chilean national. On 22 September 2008, Respondent appointed Prof. Brigitte Stern, a French national. On 27 October 2008, the Parties agreed to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as President of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n59.\n\nOn 18 November 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments. Thus, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, the Acting Secretary-General further informed the Parties that, as of the same date, the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun.\n\n60.\n\nIn the same 18 November 2008 letter, the Acting Secretary-General informed the Parties that Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n61.\n\nOn 20 January 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held the first session at the World Bank's offices in Paris, France.\n\n62.\n\nAt the first session, the Parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and stated that they had no objections to the appointment of any of the members of the Tribunal. In addition, several procedural issues on the session's agenda were discussed and agreed upon.\n\n63.\n\nThe first session was audio-recorded, and transcripts, in both English and Spanish, were produced and distributed to the Parties. Minutes were drafted, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and transmitted to the Parties on 18 February 2009.\n\n64.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal suggested, at the first session, a procedural timetable. On 19 and 25 February 2009, Ecuador and the Initial Claimants, respectively, expressed their consent to this procedural timetable.\n\n65.\n\nOn 20 February 2009, Burlington Oriente, the subsidiary holding Claimant's ownership interests in Blocks 7 and 21, filed a Request for Provisional Measures (the \"PMs Request\" or \"RPM\"), which also included a request for a temporary restraining order with immediate effect (the \"TRO Request\"), asking that the Initial Respondents refrain from: 1) enforcing payments allegedly due under Law 42, 2) affecting the legal situation of or terminating the Block 7 and 21 PSCs, and 3) engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties.\n\n66.\n\nThe PMs Request was accompanied by twelve exhibits (Exhs. C-46 to C-57), thirteen legal exhibits (Exhs. CL-1 to CL-13), and a witness statement from Mr. Alex Martinez. Following the PMs Request, the Parties engaged in a protracted exchange of correspondence further elaborating their positions in connection with the TRO Request.\n\n67.\n\nOn 4 March 2009, Ecuador filed a Preliminary Reply to Burlington Oriente's PMs Request, enclosing three exhibits (Exhs. E-3 to E-5) and nineteen legal exhibits (Exhs. EL-1 to EL-19).\n\n68.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal, considering that the TRO Request met the requirements for provisional measures, recommended \" *that the [Initial] Respondents refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the status quo until it decides on the Claimants\u2018 Request for Provisional Measures or it reconsiders the present recommendation, whichever is first* \".\n\n69.\n\nOn 17 March 2009, Ecuador filed a Reply to Burlington Oriente's PMs Request and a Request for Reconsideration of the Arbitral Tribunal's 6 March 2009 Recommendation, accompanied by five exhibits (Exhs. E-6 to E-10) and seven legal exhibits (Exhs. EL-20 to EL-26).\n\n70.\n\nBy letter dated 25 March 2009, Burlington Oriente expressed its opposition to Ecuador's Request for Reconsideration of the Arbitral Tribunal's 6 March 2009 Recommendation.\n\n71.\n\nOn 3 April 2009, the Tribunal denied Ecuador's request on the ground that no changed circumstance called for reconsideration and that the hearing on provisional measures would take place shortly thereafter.\n\n72.\n\nOn 27 March 2009, Burlington Oriente filed its Response to Ecuador's Reply to the PMs Request, accompanied by eleven exhibits (Exhs. C-58 to C-68) and eight legal exhibits (Exhs. CL-14 to CL-21).\n\n73.\n\nOn 6 April 2006, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder to Burlington Oriente's PMs Request, enclosing six exhibits (Exhs. E-11 to E-16) and fifteen legal exhibits (Exhs. EL-27 to EL-41).\n\n74.\n\nOn 17 April 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on provisional measures in Washington D.C., at which counsel for both Parties were in attendance. Transcripts, in both English and Spanish, were produced and distributed to the Parties.\n\n75.\n\nOn 29 June 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, dealing with Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, in which it recommended that: 1) the Parties *\"make their best efforts to agree on the opening of an escrow account\"* into which Burlington Oriente shall make *\"payments allegedly due under Law 42...including all payments made by the [Initial] Claimants into their segregated account\";* 2) the [Initial] Respondents *\"discontinue the [coactiva] proceedings pending\"* for the enforcement of payments allegedly due under Law 42; 3) the Parties \" *refrain from any conduct that may lead to an aggravation of the dispute\".* The Tribunal also terminated the recommendation it had issued on 6 March 2009.\n\n76.\n\nBy letter dated 18 September 2009, the Initial Claimants informed the Tribunal that, because Ecuador had completed the expropriation of Blocks 7 and 21, physically occupying them, the Burlington Subsidiaries withdrew their \"contractual claims, including those related to Blocks 23 and 24\" (the \"Contract Claims\"), while Burlington \"maintain[ed] its claims under the Treaty.\"\n\n77.\n\nBy letter of 22 September 2009, the Initial Respondents, while denying that Blocks 7 and 21 had been expropriated, stated that they would agree to the withdrawal of the Contract Claims provided that it was on a \"with prejudice\" basis. Additionally, they requested the Tribunal to withdraw Procedural Order No. 1 on the ground that Burlington Oriente had purportedly abandoned operations in Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n78.\n\nBy letter dated 10 October 2009, the Initial Claimants (a) accepted that the withdrawal of the Contract Claims should be \"with prejudice\" and (b) agreed that Procedural Order No. 1 should be withdrawn. Subsequently, and at the request of Respondent, the Initial Claimants confirmed, by letter dated 20 October 2009, that since the Contract Claims were withdrawn, PetroEcuador was no longer a party to these proceedings.\n\n79.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, whereby it ordered the following:\n\n1) Provided that the [Initial] Respondents make no objection by 6 November 2009, the **Contract Claims** will be deemed **withdrawn** with prejudice as of that date.\n\nConsequently, as of 6 November 2009, **PetroEcuador** and, subject to the [Initial] Claimants' confirmation by 2 November 2009, [the **Burlington Subsidiaries** ] **will cease to be parties to this dispute**. As a result, this arbitration will deal solely with Burlington's Treaty Claims against Ecuador.\n\n2) Procedural Order No. 1 is hereby revoked [with the caveat that \"the Parties remain under a duty not to further aggravate the dispute\"] (emphasis added).\n\n80.\n\nOn 2 November 2009, the Initial Claimants confirmed, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, that, as a result of the withdrawal of the Contract Claims, the Burlington Subsidiaries were no longer parties to these proceedings. Moreover, the Initial Respondents did not object to the withdrawal with prejudice of the Contract Claims by 6 November 2009.\n\n81.\n\nAccordingly, as of 6 November 2009, Burlington remains the sole claimant in these proceedings, and Ecuador the sole respondent. Additionally, the only outstanding claims are the claims advanced by Burlington under the Treaty (the \"Treaty Claims\").\n\n**2. Written Phase on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural timetable agreed upon following the first session, on 20 April 2009, the Initial Claimants submitted their Memorial (Mem.) accompanied by one hundred and twenty exhibits (Exhs. C-69 to C-188), one hundred and six legal exhibits (Exhs. CL-22 to CL-127), the witness statements of Taylor Reid and Herb Vickers, and the first supplemental witness statement of Alex Martinez. In addition, the Initial Claimants submitted revised versions of Exhibits C-1 to C-4, this time including authorizations, annexes and full English translations.\n\n83.\n\nBy separate letters dated 20 May 2009, Ecuador and PetroEcuador expressed their intention to raise objections to the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction by 20 July 2009.\n\n84.\n\nOn 20 July 2009, Ecuador and PetroEcuador filed, in separate submissions, Objections to Jurisdiction. Ecuador's Objections to Jurisdiction were accompanied by ninety-nine exhibits (Exhs. E-17 to E-115), fourteen legal exhibits (Exhs. EL-42 to EL-55), the witness statement of Dr. Christian D\u00e1valos, and the expert reports of Prof. Juan Pablo Aguilar and Prof. Luis Parraguez Ruiz.\n\n85.\n\nOn 20 October 2009, Burlington4 filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. Along with its submission, Burlington enclosed ten exhibits (Exhs. C-189 to C-198) and twenty one legal exhibits (Exhs. CL-128 to CL-148). Burlington did not append any witness statement or expert opinion.\n\nSince the Initial Claimants withdrew their Contract Claims on 10 October 2009, as a result of which the Burlington Subsidiaries eventually ceased to be parties to these proceedings on 6 November 2009, only Burlington filed a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n86.\n\nOn 30 October 2009, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with counsel for the Parties for the purpose of organizing the hearing on jurisdiction. In addition, on this date, the Parties sent a joint letter to the Tribunal agreeing on a number of issues with respect to the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n87.\n\nOn 9 November 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 dealing with the organization of the forthcoming hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n**3. Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nOn 22 January 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on jurisdiction in Paris. In attendance at the hearing were, in addition to the Members of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Secretary, the following party representatives:\n\n(i) On behalf of Burlington:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jason Doughty, from ConocoPhillips\n\n\u2022 Ms. Aditi Dravid (via video conference), from ConocoPhillips\n\n\u2022 Mr. Alexander Yanos, from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (\"Freshfields\")\n\n\u2022 Ms. Noiana Marigo, from Freshfields\n\n\u2022 Ms. Jessica Bannon Vanto (via video conference), from Freshfields\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ana Mar\u00eda Uribe, from Freshfields\n\n(ii) On behalf of Ecuador:\n\n\u2022 Dr. \u00c1lvaro Galindo Cardona, from Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado\n\n\u2022 Dra. Gianina Osejo, from the Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador\n\n\u2022 Prof. Pierre Mayer, from Dechert (Paris) LLP (\"Dechert\")\n\n\u2022 Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero, from Dechert\n\n\u2022 Mr. Philip Dunham, from Dechert\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, from Dechert\n\n\u2022 Ms. V\u00e9ronique Camerer, from Dechert\n\n\u2022 Ms. Edith Aupetit, from Dechert\n\n89.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Herb Vickers and, via video conference, Mr. Taylor Reid proffered witness evidence.\n\n90.\n\nDr. Galindo Cardona, Prof. Mayer, Dr. Silva Romero, and Mr. Dunham presented oral arguments on behalf of Ecuador. Mr. Yanos presented oral arguments on behalf of Burlington.\n\n91.\n\nThe jurisdictional hearing was sound recorded and transcribed *verbatim*, and copies of the sound recordings and the transcripts were subsequently delivered to the Parties.\n\n92.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has deliberated and carefully considered the arguments presented by the Parties in their written submissions and orally during the course of the jurisdictional hearing. The Tribunal shall now proceed to summarize the position of the Parties (Section III), to analyze the arguments underpinning those positions (Section IV) and finally, on the basis of this analysis, to render a decision on jurisdiction (Section V).\n\n**III. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. Position of Burlington**\n-----------------------------\n\n93.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Burlington alleged the following:\n\n(i) Burlington made an investment in Ecuador within the meaning of both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty.\n\n(ii) Ecuador has breached its Treaty obligations with respect to Burlington's investment in Ecuador.\n\n(iii) The breach of these Treaty obligations on the part of Ecuador has brought about a legal dispute between Burlington and Ecuador.\n\n(iv) The legal dispute between Burlington and Ecuador arises directly out of Burlington's investment in Ecuador.\n\n(v) Burlington and Ecuador meet the requirements of jurisdiction *ratione personae* under both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty.\n\n(vi) Burlington and Ecuador have consented in writing to submit Burlington's Treaty Claims to ICSID arbitration.\n\n94.\n\nOn the basis of these allegations, Burlington requests the Tribunal to Reject Ecuador's Jurisdictional Objections in their entirety (CM, \u00b6 86).\n\n**2. Position of Ecuador**\n--------------------------\n\n95.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Ecuador argued the following:\n\n(i) Burlington may have waived its Treaty Claim for expropriation;\n\n(ii) The Parties have not consented in writing to arbitrate Burlington's Treaty Claims under the ICSID Convention, with the exception of Burlington's Treaty Claim for expropriation.\n\n(iii) More specifically, Burlington's claims relating to Law 42 involve \"matters of taxation\" and are therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, with the exception of its claim for expropriation.\n\n(iv) Further, Burlington's claim that Ecuador allegedly failed to provide full protection and security for Blocks 23 and 24 is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because:\n\na) Burlington failed to abide by the six-month waiting period, a condition for consent under the Treaty;\n\nb) Burlington failed to perfect consent before Ecuador withdrew its offer to arbitrate this class of disputes pursuant to its declaration under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n96.\n\nOn the basis of these allegations, Ecuador requests the Tribunal to\n\n(i) Declare that Burlington's Treaty claims relating to the enactment and enforcement of Law 42, with the exception of its claims for expropriation, are expressly precluded by the U.S.-Ecuador BIT and outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\n(ii) Declare that no valid consent exists under the U.S.-Ecuador BIT and the ICSID Convention for the Treaty claims relating to Ecuador's alleged failure to provide full protection and security for Blocks 23 and 24 (other than in addition to Law 42).\n\n(OJ, \u00b6 84).\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal will refer to the Parties' positions in more details if and when appropriate in the course of its analysis.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**1. Preliminary Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n98.\n\nBefore examining the arguments presented by the Parties, the Tribunal will address three preliminary matters, i.e. the relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards (1.1); the law applicable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (1.2); and matters that are undisputed by the Parties (1.3).\n\n**1.1 The Relevance of Previous ICSID Decisions or Awards**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIn support of their positions, both parties have relied on previous ICSID decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case, or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions5. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. The majority believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards the certainty of the rule of law. Arbitrator Stern does not analyze the arbitrator's role in the same manner, as she considers it her duty to decide each case on its own merits, independently of any apparent jurisprudential trend.\n\n*See e.g.*, *Saipem S.p.A. v. the People's Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on jurisdiction and recommendation on provisional measures of 21 March 2007, para. 67, available at http://www.icsid.org; *AES Corporation v. the Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on jurisdiction of 13 July 2005, para. 30-32, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/ decisions/AES-Argentina\\_Jurisdiction.pdf.\n\n**1.2 Law Applicable to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nJurisdiction is governed by the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT between the United-States and Ecuador.\n\n102.\n\nIn particular, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n103.\n\nThe relevant provision of the BIT, in turn, is Article VI, pursuant to which ICSID arbitration is available in the following terms:\n\n\"1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution: [\u2026]\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2(a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention [\u2026].\"\n\n104.\n\nThe interpretation of both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty is governed by customary international law as codified by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n**1.3 Undisputed Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal is the \"judge of its own competence\", as established in Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n106.\n\nFurthermore, the Parties do not dispute that the following four conditions must be met for the Tribunal to uphold jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n(i) The dispute must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State;\n\n(ii) The dispute must be a legal dispute;\n\n(iii) The dispute must arise directly out of an investment; and\n\n(iv) The parties must have expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration in writing.\n\n107.\n\nBurlington alleges, and Ecuador does not dispute, both rightly so, that the following three conditions of jurisdiction are met in this case:\n\n(i) The dispute is between Ecuador, a Contracting State, and Burlington, a national of another Contracting State, namely, the United States;\n\n(ii) The dispute is a legal dispute;\n\n(iii) The dispute arises directly out of Burlington's investment in Ecuador.\n\n108.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal deems that the three conditions of jurisdiction enumerated in the preceding paragraph are fulfilled.\n\n109.\n\nWith respect to the fourth condition, namely, consent, Ecuador argues that it has not consented to arbitrate Burlington's Treaty claims other than the claim for expropriation under the ICSID Convention. It also contends that, even though it did consent to arbitrate the expropriation claim, Burlington may have waived this claim. The Tribunal will examine Ecuador's arguments below.\n\n**1.4. Test for Establishing Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nAt the jurisdictional stage, it must be established that the conditions to jurisdiction set in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and in the BIT are met. In addition, Claimant's allegations of fact are subject to a *prima facie* standard according to which the alleged facts should be susceptible of constituting a breach of the Treaty if they were ultimately proven6. The Tribunal finds that this standard strikes a proper balance between a more exacting standard which would call for examination of the merits at the jurisdictional stage, and a less exacting standard which would confer excessive weight to the Claimant's own characterization of its claims.\n\nOn the *prima facie* test of treaty breach for purposes of jurisdiction, *see* among others *UPS v. Canada*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 November 2002, paras. 33-37; *Siemens v. Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, para. 180, available at http://www.icsid.org; *Plama v. Bulgaria*, paras. 118-120, 132; *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* paras. 185-200; *El Paso v. Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, paras. 40-45, 109, available at http://www.icsid.org ; *Jan de Nul v.

Hungary*, Award, 13 September 2006, paras. 34, 53, 68, 80, available at http://www.icsid.org.\n\n**2. Ecuador's Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nEcuador has objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the following three main grounds:\n\n(i) First, Burlington's expropriation claim is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal if the Tribunal finds that Burlington has waived any challenge against Law 42 and the Decrees (Tr. 203:9-21).\n\n(ii) Second, Burlington's claims relating to Law 42, other than its claim for expropriation (the \"Law 42 non-expropriation claims\"), are outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because:\n\na) They involve \"matters of taxation\" and therefore, pursuant to the tax carve-out of Article X, are excluded from the scope of the Treaty (OJ, Sections 2, 2.1 and 2.2);\n\nb) And Burlington does not seek to enforce the terms of an \"investment agreement\", one of the categories of arbitration claims that may be asserted in relation to \"matters of taxation\", as that term is used in Article X (OJ, Sections 2.3 and 2.4).\n\n(iii) Third, Burlington's claim for Ecuador's alleged failure to provide full protection and security for Blocks 23 and 24 is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because:\n\na) Burlington failed to abide by the six-month waiting period, a condition for consent under the Treaty (OJ, Section 4.1);\n\nb) Burlington failed to perfect consent before Ecuador withdrew its offer to arbitrate this class of disputes pursuant to Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention (OJ, Section 4.2).\n\n**2.1 Objection to Jurisdiction in Respect of the Expropriation Claim**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nEcuador raises a conditional objection to Burlington's expropriation claim. During oral argument, Ecuador stated that \"if the Tribunal were to find that Burlington, in [its] last Memorial [has] waived any criticism against Law 42 and the Decrees\", then the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's expropriation claim (Tr. 203:9-21).\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal must thus determine (i) whether the condition upon which Respondent's objection depends is present, and (ii) if it is present, whether the objection is well founded.\n\n114.\n\nTurning to the first issue, in its Memorial on Liability, Burlington brought an expropriation claim against Ecuador. This claim unambiguously challenged the legality of Law 42 and of the Decrees. A few examples will help to illustrate this point. First, Burlington stated that Law 42 and the Decrees constitute a \"taking in violation of Article III of the Treaty\" (Mem., \u00b6 428). Second, Burlington expressed that the \"application\" of Law 42 to Burlington \"is tantamount to an unlawful expropriation\" (Mem., \u00a7 V.C.1). Third, Burlington alleged that Ecuador had confiscated its \"revenues through an unlawful ta\"x (Mem., \u00b6 442).\n\n115.\n\nIn its Objections to Jurisdiction, Ecuador originally conceded that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over Burlington's expropriation claim. In its submission, Ecuador concluded that:\n\n\"[A]ll of Burlington's Treaty claims relating to Law 42 and its enforcement should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, **with the exception of the claim for expropriation under Article III** (emphasis added)\" (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 41).\n\n116.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Burlington noted that Ecuador \"concede[d] that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Burlington's expropriation claim\" (CM, \u00a7 2.A). Burlington also submitted that \"the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all of Burlington's non-expropriation claims relating to Law 2006-42\" (CM, \u00a7 2.B). In support of this submission, Burlington made a series of arguments, one of which was that \"Burlington does not challenge Ecuador's right to apply Law 2006-42 to the extent that it is a tax\" (CM, \u00a7 2.B.1.b).\n\n117.\n\nTo rule on Respondent's conditional objection, the Tribunal must ascertain whether, in its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimant has waived its criticism of \"Law 42 and the Decrees\" *with respect to its expropriation claim*. In the view of the Tribunal, Claimant has not waived its criticism of Law 42 and the Decrees with respect to its expropriation claim.\n\n118.\n\nFirst, Claimant has never expressed an intention to waive its challenge to Law 42 *with respect to its expropriation claim*. On the contrary, Claimant expressed that it *unconditionally* challenged Law 42 in its Memorial on Liability, where it has most thoroughly articulated its legal arguments. In particular, Claimant stated that \"[w]hether Law No. 2006-42 is considered a tax, a royalty or a violation of Burlington's [contractual] right...it is a taking in violation of Ecuador's [obligations]\" (Mem., \u00b6 436).\n\n119.\n\nSecond, this categorical position is to be contrasted with the conditional nature of Claimant's arguments *with respect to its non-expropriation claims*. With respect to these claims, Burlington challenges Law 42 only \"if it is not a tax\"; but, \"to the extent that it is a tax\", Claimant *does not challenge* Law 42 (CM, \u00a7 2.B.1.b; Tr. 102:9-22; 109:16-110:3). No similar argument was made in the section about Claimant's *expropriation claim* (\u00a7 2.A). Therefore, at no point did Claimant waive any challenge to Law 42 *with respect to its expropriation claim*.\n\n120.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal finds that Burlington has not waived its challenge of Law 42 and the Decrees with respect to its expropriation claims. The condition upon which Respondent's objection was predicated is not met, and its objection to jurisdiction consequently vanishes on its own terms.\n\n121.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Burlington's expropriation claim.\n\n**2.2 Objections to Jurisdiction in Respect of the Law 42 Non-Expropriation Claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nEcuador's second objection to jurisdiction is rooted in Article X of the Treaty and is directed at Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims. This objection raises the following two issues:\n\n(i) Do Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims involve \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty?\n\n(ii) Do Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims involve the observance and enforcement of an \"investment agreement\" under Article X(2)(c) of the Treaty?\n\n123.\n\nArticle X of the Treaty provides the following:\n\n1. With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n2. Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI (1) (a) or (b), to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.\n\n124.\n\nIn view of the structure of Article X, the Tribunal will first examine whether Claimant's Law 42 non-expropriation claims raise \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty. If the Tribunal concludes that these claims involve \"matters of taxation\", it will proceed to review whether these claims relate to the observance and enforcement of an \"investment agreement\" within the meaning of Article X(2)(c) to rule on its jurisdiction. By contrast, if the Tribunal considers that these claims do *not* involve \"matters of taxation\", then Ecuador's objections to jurisdiction in respect of the Law 42 non-expropriation claims will have to be dismissed.\n\n**2.2.1 Law 42 Non-Expropriation Claims as \"Matters of Taxation\" Under Article X of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Ecuador's Arguments**\n--------------------------\n\n125.\n\nEcuador alleges that Burlington's non-expropriation claims challenge the enactment and enforcement of Law 42, thus raising \"matters of taxation\" which are excluded from the scope of the Treaty as per Article X (OJ, \u00b6 14).\n\n126.\n\nThe purpose of the tax carve-out in Article X of the Treaty is to preserve the State's discretion in the exercise of its power to tax. States rely heavily upon this power to tax in order to raise revenue destined to promote social and political objectives, provide for the national security, and generally foster the public welfare (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23).\n\n127.\n\nSince the power to tax serves so vital State interests, the extent to which the United States and Ecuador were willing, under the Treaty, to subject this power to the scrutiny of an unelected and unaccountable international tribunal \"was very limited.\" Therefore, Ecuador concludes, \"the limits of that consent should be respected\" (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18, 23).\n\n(i) Article X of the Treaty is both relevant and applicable to this dispute\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nEcuador maintains that Article X is both relevant and applicable to this dispute. It is relevant because Burlington \"truly challenges Law 42\" (Tr. 25:19-20). Numerous excerpts from the Memorial, the request for provisional measures, and the witness statement of Alex Martinez indicate that Burlington \"truly claims that [Law 42] constitute[s] a breach of the treaty\" (Tr. 25:20-21).\n\n129.\n\nArticle X is also applicable to this dispute. Ecuador notes that the term \"matters of taxation\" is not defined in the Treaty. However, Ecuador argues that arbitral tribunals interpreting Article X or similar provisions have consistently construed this term broadly (OJ, \u00b6 24).\n\n130.\n\nIn *EnCana v. Ecuador* (\" *EnCana* \")7, the arbitral tribunal, construing a tax carve-out similar to Article X contained in the Canada-Ecuador BIT, held that the meaning of \"taxation\" was not limited to \"direct taxation\", and that it encompasses \"any executive act...implementing that [tax] law.\" Subsequently, in *Duke Energy v. Ecuador* (\" *Duke Energy* \")8, the arbitral tribunal, applying the exact same Article X here under scrutiny, embraced the *EnCana* tribunal's broad construction of the term \"matters of taxation\" (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26).\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, (UNCITRAL) Award dated 3 February 2006 (Exh. EL-45).\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award dated 18 August 2008. (Exh. CL-41)\n\n131.\n\nThe *EnCana* and *Duke Energy* tribunals provided relevant definitions to ascertain the meaning of \"matters of taxation\" (Tr. 31:18-19). In *EnCana*, the tribunal defined a \"taxation law\" as \"one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes\" (Tr. 31:19-32:1). In *Duke Energy*, the tribunal held that \"the ruling in *EnCana v. Ecuador* appears to be of particular relevance\" (Tr. 32:2-8).\n\n132.\n\nLaw 42 is a tax within the meaning of *EnCana* and *Duke Energy*. This is because Law 42 imposes a tax on extraordinary profits for increases in the price of oil which \"goes directly into the account of the State not of the -- in the account of Petroecuador, as all taxes do in the Cuenta Unica of the State at the Central Bank.\" (Tr. 31:4-8). As such, Burlington's challenges to Law 42 raise \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty.\n\n133.\n\nHowever, Law 42 is not a tax under Ecuadorian law because it reformed the Hydrocarbons Law, which is not itself a tax law. It follows that Law 42 is not a tax under Ecuadorian law only \"in a very narrow...technical sense\" (Tr. 33:14-34:11). In any event, for purposes of Article X of the Treaty, it is irrelevant that Law 42 is not a tax under Ecuadorian law. Under Article X, all that matters is that Law 42 \"imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes\" (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28).\n\n134.\n\nEcuador asserts that Burlington contradicts itself in characterizing Law 42. On the one hand, Burlington states that \"measures deemed to be taxes within the internal law of the state issuing the ta\"x are \"matters of taxation\" under Article X (Tr. 29:2023). On the other hand, Burlington points that \"Law 42 is a tax as a matter of Ecuadorian law\" (Tr. 30:2-3). If the latter is true, then Burlington's objection, in the sense that Law 42 does not raise \"matters of taxation\", \"disappears\" (Tr. 30:9-11).\n\n135.\n\nIn addition, the decision in *Occidental Exploration and Production Co. v. The Republic of Ecuador* (\" *Occidental* \")9, on which Burlington heavily relies, is distinguishable from this case. In *Occidental*, the claimant did not challenge the tax law, whereas here Burlington \"is challenging\" the tax law (Tr. 28:17). Further, the dispute in *Occidental* was triggered by a \"new interpretation of a contractual clause by Ecuador\" and not, as here, by the enactment of Law 42, a \"fiscal measure\" (Tr. 28:20-29:3).\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, London Court of International Arbitration Case No. UN3467, Final Award dated July 1, 2004. (Exh. CL-41).\n\n136.\n\nIn sum, under Article X of the Treaty, the extent to which Ecuador consented to arbitrate disputes related to \"matters of taxation\" is \"very limited.\" It follows that investors have limited Treaty protection with respect to taxation matters. In particular, investors may not invoke Treaty provisions such as \"fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, most-favoured-nation, and national treatment\" when taxation is involved (OJ, \u00b6 19).\n\n137.\n\nThus, Burlington's non-expropriation claims relating to the enactment and enforcement of Law 42 raise \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty. As a result, Ecuador concludes that they \"should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction\" (OJ, \u00b6 41).\n\n(ii) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction even if Burlington is not challenging Law 42\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nEcuador argues that even if Burlington were not challenging Law 42, but merely seeking to enforce the contractual tax indemnification clauses purportedly violated by Ecuador, Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation Treaty claims would still lie outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction for the following three reasons (Tr. 38:22-39-21).\n\n139.\n\nFirst, \"Burlington simply withdrew its contract claims\" (Tr. 43:3-4). Hence, enforcement of contract provisions is not within the scope of this Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n140.\n\nSecond, \"the purported breach of the [tax readjustment] clauses could not amount to a Treaty breach\" (Tr. 43:21-23). In support of this proposition, Ecuador relies upon the ICSID awards in *Pantechniki v. Albania (\"Pantechniki\")*, *EDF v. Romania*, *CMS v. Argentina (\"CMS\")*, and *Duke Energy v. Ecuador* (Tr. 44:3-48:2).10\n\n*Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award dated 30 July 2009 (Exh. CL-41 *); EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13), Award dated 8 October 2009; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award dated 12 May 2005.\n\n141.\n\nPursuant to *Pantechniki*, the claims of the investor must be characterized by reference to the \"normative source\" from which these claims derive (Tr. 44:15-19). Here, the PSCs are the normative source on which Burlington's Treaty claims are based, from which it follows that \"Burlington is not making any treaty claim\" (Tr. 45:9-10). According to *EDF v. Romania,* \"it is not enough that the State itself be a party to the relevant contract for the breach of contract to become a treaty breach\" (Tr. 45:21-24). Finally, under *CMS* and *Duke Energy,* \"there can only be a treaty claim [for breach of a contract] if there is exercise of sovereign power\" (Tr. 46:1117; 47:21-23).\n\n142.\n\nThird, \"the umbrella clause of the treaty is of no assistance to Burlington\" (Tr. 48:78). This is because the umbrella clause is inoperative without privity of contract. \"[I]f there is no privity in a contract between Claimant and Respondent in an investment case, the umbrella clause simply does not work\" (Tr. 50:7-10). According to Ecuador, the annulment decision in *CMS v. Argentina*, as well as the awards in *Impregilo v. Pakistan* and *EDF v. Romania* lend support to this conclusion (Tr. 49:6-50:24).\n\n143.\n\nAs a result, Ecuador submits that Burlington's non-expropriation Treaty claims relating to the enactment and enforcement of Law 42 should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction (OJ, \u00b6 84(a)). Specifically, Ecuador concludes that the following claims are subject to dismissal:\n\n(i) Failure to afford fair and equitable treatment (Article II(3)(a));\n\n(ii) Failure to afford full protection and security (Article II(3)(a));\n\n(iii) Arbitrary and discriminatory impairment (Article II(3)(b));\n\n(iv) Violation of the observance of obligations clause (the \"umbrella clause\") (Article II(3)(c) (OJ, \u00b6 41).\n\n**B. Burlington's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n144.\n\nBurlington claims that its Law 42 non-expropriation claims do not raise \"matters of taxation\" excluded under Article X, and that these claims are therefore covered by the Treaty (CM, \u00b6 7).\n\n145.\n\nBurlington disagrees with Ecuador about the purpose of Article X. According to Burlington, the purpose of Article X is to exclude tax matters from the BIT \"on the assumption that tax matters are properly covered in bilateral tax treaties\" (Tr. 105:14-18). For this reason, this dispute, not being subject to a bilateral tax treaty, falls within the scope of the BIT (Tr. 106:12-25).\n\n146.\n\nThe purpose of Article X is not, as Ecuador alleges, \"to respect some amorphous concept of sovereignty\" (Tr. 105:21-25). In any case, Burlington notes that it is not asking this Tribunal to scrutinize or curtail Ecuador's taxing power (CM, \u00b6 38).\n\n147.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador's position regarding the characterization of Law 42 is contradictory. According to Ecuador's own admission, Law 42 is not a tax under Ecuadorian Law. Yet, if Law 42 is not a tax under Ecuadorian law, it cannot be a tax under Article X of the Treaty, nor raise \"matters of taxation\" (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 1214).\n\n(i) Whether or not Law 42 is a tax, Article X does not apply to this dispute\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nBurlington's primary contention is that Law 42 is a tax under Ecuadorian law. \"If the Tribunal wants to reach a conclusion, a definitive conclusion on its own as to whether Law 42 is a tax or not....the proper answer [is that] it is a tax under Ecuadorian law\" (Tr. 98:10-16). However, Burlington makes also an alternative argument should the Tribunal find that Law 42 is not a tax (CM, \u00b6 15; Tr. 99:12-19).\n\n149.\n\nBurlington advances, in short, the following two arguments. First and foremost, if Law 42 *is a tax*, Article X does not apply because Burlington is not challenging \"the imposition of a tax, or a failure to exempt from a ta\"x (Tr. 109:16-23). Second and in the alternative, if Law 42 *is not a tax*, Burlington does challenge Law 42; yet, Article X still does not apply because Article X applies only to \"matters of taxation\", and if Law 42 is not a tax, it cannot give rise to \"matters of taxation\" (Tr. 109:24110:2).\n\n150.\n\nBurlington argues that Law 42 can be a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty only if it is a tax under Ecuadorian law (CM, \u00b6 14; Tr. 225:1-6). In the alternative, since the Parties disagree on the \"basic question\" of whether Law 42 is a tax, Burlington invites the Tribunal to join this issue to the merits (CM, \u00b6 15; Tr. 96:197:1).\n\n151.\n\nBurlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims are not \"matters of taxation\" because Burlington is not challenging the enactment and enforcement, nor the validity of Law 42. Rather, Burlington is challenging Ecuador's failure to comply with its obligation to indemnify Burlington for the imposition of Law 42 in accordance with the PSCs and with the overall legal framework (CM, \u00b6 18; Tr. 100:3-8)\n\n152.\n\nThe most relevant decision to this dispute is *Occidental*. In that case, Occidental brought claims against Ecuador for the denial of valued-added tax (\"VAT\") reimbursements. The tribunal held that Occidental's claims did not raise a matter of tax law, but rather a matter of contract interpretation (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24).\n\n153.\n\nIndeed, Occidental did not dispute the \"existence of the tax or its percentage\"; instead, it claimed that a refund was due under the terms of the contract. Likewise, Burlington here is not challenging the tax created by Law 42, but claiming an adjustment due under the terms of the PSCs (CM, \u00b6 25).\n\n154.\n\n*EnCana* and *Duke Energy*, on which Ecuador relies, are distinguishable. Both of these cases, in fact, \"involved direct challenges to taxation measures\" (CM, \u00b6 26). In *EnCana*, the claimant challenged the amount of VAT liability assessed against its subsidiaries, whereas in *Duke Energy* the claimant disputed the denial of a customs duty exemption (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30). However, neither *EnCana* nor *Duke Energy* bears relevance here, for Burlington is not challenging the validity of Law 42 (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32).\n\n(ii) The nature and legal source of Ecuador's indemnification obligation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nEcuador was under a Treaty obligation to indemnify Burlington for the effects of Law 42 by adjusting the parties' respective production sharing percentages. This Treaty-based obligation is rooted in the PSCs and the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 32; Tr. 100:8-10). Ecuador's failure to indemnify Burlington for the effects of the Law 42 tax breached Burlington's Treaty right (i) to fair and equitable treatment, (ii) to full protection and security, (iii) to umbrella clause protection and (iv) to not be subject to arbitrary and discriminatory impairment (CM, \u00b6 21; Tr. 100:11-101:13).\n\n156.\n\nEcuador breached Burlington's Treaty right to fair and equitable treatment because Ecuador's indemnification obligation, rooted in both the PSCs and the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework, \"became part of Burlington's legitimate expectations...the frustration of [which] constitutes a violation of the Treaty's fair and equitable treatment clause\" (Tr. 100:11-101:5). Similarly, Ecuador's failure to indemnify breached Burlington's right to \"full protection and security clause\" and to umbrella clause protection (Tr. 101:5-8).\n\n157.\n\nBurlington notes that the *Pantechniki* decision, invoked by Ecuador to argue that Burlington's claims are rooted in the PSCs and not in the Treaty, is distinguishable from this dispute because in that case there was no umbrella clause (Tr. 114:3-19).\n\n158.\n\nIn sum, Article X of the Treaty does not apply to this dispute, and thus Ecuador's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims should be dismissed (CM, \u00b6 32).\n\n**C. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims raise \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty. The Tribunal is of the view that there can be \"matters of taxation\" under Article X only if there is a tax within the meaning of that provision. The arguments of the Parties also presupposed this view. However, the Parties disagree on what constitutes a tax under Article X.\n\n160.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal must determine (i) whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty and, if so, (ii) whether Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims raise \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of that provision. If the Tribunal were to find that Law 42 is not a tax, then Article X would not be applicable to this dispute and the Tribunal would dispense with the second determination.\n\n(i) Is Law 42 a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Tribunal's first task is to ascertain whether Law 42 is a tax *for purposes of Article X of the Treaty*. Claimant states that Law 42 can be a tax for purposes of Article X \"only if\" it is a tax under Ecuadorian law (CM, \u00b6 14; Tr. 225:1-6). The Tribunal does not agree.\n\n162.\n\nArticle X forms part of an international treaty between the United States and Ecuador. An international treaty is governed by international law, not by the domestic law of either the United States or Ecuador. Accordingly, the question whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X is governed by international law, not by Ecuadorian law.\n\n163.\n\nTherefore, for purposes of jurisdiction, the Tribunal needs only to decide whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty under international law. In other words, there is no point in the Tribunal determining at this stage whether Law 42 is a tax under Ecuadorian law. In this fashion, the question of whether Law 42 is a tax under Ecuadorian law will be decided, if it needs to be decided, at the merits phase.\n\n164.\n\nTo answer the question whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty under international law, the Tribunal finds that the *EnCana* and *Duke Energy* decisions are indeed apposite. In *EnCana*, the tribunal held that a \"ta\"x is \"imposed by law\" and that this \"taxation law is one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes.\" In *Duke Energy*, the tribunal, dealing with the Treaty applicable to this dispute, held that \"the ruling in *EnCana v. Ecuador* appears to be of particular relevance\" to elucidate the meaning of \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty.\n\n165.\n\nBuilding on *EnCana's* ruling, *Duke Energy* stands for the proposition that there is \"tax\" under Article X of the Treaty if the following four requirements are met: (i) there is a law (ii) that imposes a liability on classes of persons (iii) to pay money to the State (iv) for public purposes. Under this definition, the Tribunal is of the view that Law 42 is a tax.\n\n166.\n\nFirst, Law 42 is, as its very name indicates, a law. Second, that law imposes a liability on \"classes of persons\", namely, on contracting companies having PSCs in force with Ecuador whenever the currently prevailing price of oil exceeds a preset reference price. Third, in accordance with this liability, these \"classes of persons\" must pay money to the State on a monthly basis. Fourth and finally, the monies so collected are available for the State to use for public purposes. As Ecuador indicated, the money collected under Law 42 \"goes directly into the account of the State...as all taxes do, in the *Cuenta Unica* of the State at the Central Bank\" (Tr. 31:7-11). The Tribunal also notes that Burlington paid the monies due under Law 42 through the same Tax Consortium which is liable for income taxes in Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n167.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty. In light of this conclusion, the Tribunal must now determine whether Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims raise \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X.\n\n(ii) Do Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims raise \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nUnder Article X of the Treaty, \"matters of taxation\" are as a rule excluded from the scope of the Treaty. The Parties agree that a dispute raises \"matters of taxation\" whenever an investor challenges the validity or enforcement of a tax. However, the Parties disagree on whether Claimant is challenging Law 42 or not.\n\n169.\n\nClaimant states that it is not challenging Law 42, but merely Respondent's failure to comply with its obligation to indemnify Claimant for the effects of Law 42 on the economics of the PSCs. Respondent in turn maintains that Claimant is challenging Law 42. According to Respondent, \"although Burlington says it does not challenge [Law 42], in fact it does....Burlington well and truly challenges Law 42 and the Decrees\" (Tr. 18:7-8; 25:18:20).\n\n170.\n\nTo determine whether Claimant challenges Law 42 or not, the Tribunal will take into account Claimant's position throughout these proceedings, including in (i) its Request for Arbitration, (ii) its Request for Provisional Measures, (iii) its Memorial on Liability, (iv) and, finally, in its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and at the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n171.\n\nFirst, in its Request for Arbitration of 21 April 2008, Burlington stated the following in the section dealing with Ecuador's purported \"Treaty Violations\":\n\n\"Ecuador's imposition of a host of measures, including Law 2006-42, its implementing regulations, and principally Decree 662, and outright refusal to honor its contractual obligation to provide Burlington its participation in the crude or *alternatively* absorb the effects of such measures, abrogated Ecuador's Treaty obligations towards Burlington [\u2026] (emphasis added) (RFA, \u00b6 95).\"\n\n172.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration, Burlington included Law 42 as part of a \"host of measures\" which \"abrogated Ecuador's Treaty obligations towards Burlington.\" Burlington argued only \"alternatively\" that Ecuador's failure to \"absorb the effects of [Law 42 and the Decrees]\" also formed part of that \"host of measures.\" Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Burlington's primary contention in the Request \u2013 *i.e.* that Law 42 was part of a \"host of measures\" which violated Ecuador's Treaty obligations towards Burlington \u2013 posed a challenge to Law 42.\n\n173.\n\nSecond, in its Request for Provisional Measures of 20 February 2009, Burlington requested an order from the Tribunal recommending that:\n\nEcuador\u2026refrain from demanding payment of amounts allegedly due under Law No. 2006-42 and commencing any action or adopting any resolution or decision that may directly or indirectly lead to the forced or coerced payment of any amount relating to Law No. 2006-42 (RPM, \u00b6 84(i)).\n\n174.\n\nThe Request for Provisional Measures evinces that Claimant was challenging both (i) the validity of Law 42 (\"amounts *allegedly* due\") and (ii) the enforcement of Law 42 (\"refrain from demanding payment\u2026under Law 42\" and \"from commencing any action...that may lead...to the forced or coerced payment of any amount [due under Law 42]\"). Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Burlington also challenged Law 42 in its Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n175.\n\nThird, in its Memorial on Liability of 20 April 2009, Claimant has argued that Ecuador breached the Treaty because it failed \"to honor its obligation to absorb the effects of [Law 42]\" (Mem., \u00b6 370). For reasons that will be explained below, the Tribunal considers that this claim does not pose a challenge to Law 42 itself. Yet, Claimant has also argued, for instance, that Ecuador has used \"its sovereign taxing power in bad faith to force Burlington to accept a new service contract\" (Mem., \u00b6 406). Thus, the Tribunal finds that, in its Memorial on Liability, Claimant has challenged Law 42, but only in part.\n\n176.\n\nFourth, in its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction of 20 October 2009, Claimant stated that its \"non-expropriation claims arise out of Ecuador's failure to indemnify it for the effects of Law 2006-42.\" In its Counter-Memorial, Claimant invoked no other obligation as the basis of its Law 42 non-expropriation claims. At the hearing on jurisdiction of 22 January 2010, Claimant confirmed this view by stating that \"what was unlawful about that tax [Law 42] is not the tax itself, but the failure to indemnify for the imposition of that ta\"x (Tr. 100:5-8). As the Tribunal noted in the previous paragraph, this claim does not pose a challenge to Law 42 itself.\n\n177.\n\nIn sum, throughout these proceedings, Claimant has submitted various claims and arguments, some of which challenge and some of which do not challenge Law 42. The question thus is not so much whether Claimant has challenged Law 42 on the whole, but rather what specific claims pose a challenge to Law 42. In light thereof, the Tribunal will examine the claims advanced by Claimant individually in order to ascertain whether Law 42 is challenged or not with respect to each claim.\n\n(iii) What specific claim or claims advanced by Burlington challenge Law 42?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nIn its Memorial on Liability, Claimant has advanced Law 42 non-expropriation claims for breach of the following Treaty provisions: (i) observance of obligations clause; (ii) fair and equitable treatment; (iii) arbitrary and discriminatory impairment; and (iv) full protection and security.\n\n1) Claims for breach of the observance of obligations clause\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nClaimant has advanced claims for Respondent's purported breach of obligations covered by the observance of obligations clause of the Treaty (the \"umbrella clause\"). This clause is enshrined in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, which provides as follows:\n\n\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investment.\"\n\n180.\n\nClaimant brings three umbrella clause claims for the breach of obligations that would arise from the PSCs as well as from the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. First, Respondent failed to indemnify Claimant for the imposition of the Law 42 tax. Second, provided that Law 42 is not a tax, Respondent failed to exempt Claimant from Law 42. Third, Respondent failed to guarantee Claimant the agreed-upon share of crude production.\n\n181.\n\nThe first umbrella clause claim is predicated on Respondent's alleged failure to indemnify Burlington for the imposition of the Law 42 tax. Claimant does not bring this claim on the ground that Law 42 is unlawful or that Law 42 should not be enforced against Claimant. Claimant rather seeks to enforce contractual indemnification obligations by virtue of which Respondent assumed the obligation to absorb the effects of new taxes or the increase of existing taxes. In the view of the Tribunal, this claim does not raise \"matters of taxation.\" Just like in *Occidental*, on which Claimant properly relies, this claim revolves around a contract matter, not a \"matter of taxation\" (*Occidental*, \u00b6 74).\n\n182.\n\nIndeed, Respondent's indemnification obligation under the PSCs is unrelated to its taxing power as a sovereign state. The contract indemnification clauses bind the investor just as much as they bind Respondent. As Respondent noted, the indemnification clauses are clauses \"which either party can invoke. If there is a decrease in taxation, then it is Ecuador who can claim re-establishment of the economics [of the contract]. If there is an increase, it is the other party, but it works perfectly symmetrically\" (Tr. 26:12-18). The Tribunal agrees.\n\n183.\n\nThus, two private parties who have no power whatsoever over taxes could enter into an indemnification clause identical to those contained in the PSCs, *i.e.* if there is a tax increase, the contract price is reduced, and vice versa. And if one of the parties were to seek enforcement of the indemnification clause, it would not mean that that party is challenging the tax that prompted the application of the clause; rather, it would simply *invoke* the tax to substantiate its claim for indemnification. This logic does not change when the State is one of the parties subject to the clause. Hence, the Tribunal is of the view that this claim does not raise \"matters of taxation.\"\n\n184.\n\nThe second umbrella clause claim is based on Respondent's failure to exempt Claimant from Law 42 *to the extent that Law 42 is not a tax* (Mem., \u00b6 370). However, as the Tribunal previously concluded, Law 42 *is* a tax for purposes of Article X, and therefore this claim lapses on its own terms.\n\n185.\n\nThe third umbrella clause claim rests on Respondent's obligation to guarantee Claimant a fixed participation in crude oil production in accordance with the formulas set out in the PSCs. Burlington's third umbrella clause claim is conditional on the Tribunal finding a violation with respect to either the first or the second umbrella clause claims previously analyzed. In particular, Claimant advances this claim \"only to the extent\" that Respondent has failed to either \"absorb the effects of [Law 42]\" (first umbrella clause claim) or to exempt Claimant from \"the application of [Law 42]\" if Law 42 is not a tax or a royalty (second umbrella clause claim) (Mem., \u00b6 370).\n\n186.\n\nBecause Claimant's third umbrella clause depends upon the first and the second umbrella clause claims, the third umbrella clause claim must share the fate of those claims. In particular, the Tribunal has already found that the first umbrella clause claim does not raise \"matters of taxation\", and that the second umbrella clause claim lapses on its own terms. In light thereof, the Tribunal considers that, to the extent that this third claim is contingent upon the first umbrella clause claim, it does not raise \"matters of taxation.\" On the other hand, to the extent that this third claim is contingent upon the second umbrella clause claim, it lapses on its own terms just as the second claim did.\n\n187.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that: (i) the first umbrella clause claim does not raise \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty; (ii) the second umbrella clause claim lapses on its own terms; (iii) the third umbrella clause claim does not raise \"matters of taxation\" to the extent that it is dependent upon the first umbrella clause claim (the \"first limb\" of the third umbrella clause claim), and lapses on its own terms to the extent that it is dependent upon the second umbrella clause claim (the \"second limb\" of the third umbrella clause claim).\n\n188.\n\nEcuador has raised additional objections in case the Tribunal were to find that Burlington's umbrella clause claims do not raise \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty. Since the Tribunal found that the second umbrella clause claim and the second limb of the third umbrella clause claim have lapsed on their own terms, it must be understood that these additional objections are directed only against the first umbrella clause claim and against the first limb of the third umbrella clause claim.\n\n189.\n\nAs a first additional objection, Ecuador stresses that Burlington has withdrawn its contract claims. While that is true, the Tribunal notes that Burlington's umbrella clause claim is a Treaty claim, not a contract claim. As the tribunal in *Bayindir v. Republic of Pakistan* (\" *Bayindir\")* held, the distinction between treaty and contract claims, tracing back to the *ad hoc committee's* decision in *Vivendi v. Argentina*, \"is now well-established\" (*Bayindir,* Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 148) Thus, Ecuador's objection cannot stand.\n\n190.\n\nSecond, Ecuador alleges that Burlington's claims do not involve the exercise of sovereign power. This requirement, however, has no support in the text of the umbrella clause of the Treaty. Moreover, while different views have been expressed on this matter, in line with other decisions such as for instance *Duke Energy*, the Tribunal considers that umbrella clauses may apply even if no exercise of sovereign power is involved *(Duke Energy, \u00b6 320)*. Consequently, Claimant may rely upon the treaty's umbrella clause even if no exercise of Respondent's sovereign power is involved. Hence, Ecuador's objection cannot stand.\n\n191.\n\nThird, Ecuador alleges that the umbrella clause is of no avail to Burlington because there is no privity of contract between Ecuador and Burlington (the \"privity objection\"). In support of its position, Ecuador relies upon *Impregilo v. Pakistan* (\" *Impregilo* \"), *EDF v. Romania,* and the *ad hoc committee's* decision in *CMS v. Argentina*. The Tribunal will examine the relevance to this dispute of each of these decisions.\n\n192.\n\nIn *Impregilo,* the issue was whether the dispute resolution clause of the Italy-Pakistan BIT applied to a state entity other than Pakistan. The tribunal held that it did not (Exh. EL-60, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 216). Significantly, there was no umbrella clause in the BIT applicable to that case. As a result, the tribunal in that case dealt with a very different issue from the one raised here. In *Impregilo*, the issue was whether the dispute resolution clause was binding upon state entities other than Pakistan; here, by contrast, the issue is whether Burlington may rely upon the Treaty's umbrella clause to enforce obligations that Ecuador indisputably assumed in the PSCs.\n\n193.\n\nIn *EDF v. Romania*, the issue was whether claimant could invoke the umbrella clause of the UK-Romania BIT, the wording of which is similar to the BIT in this case, to enforce obligations assumed by Romanian state entities other than the Romanian state. The tribunal held that claimant could not so invoke the umbrella clause, because the umbrella clause only applied \"to obligations assumed by the Romanian state\" (Exh. EL-59, \u00b6 317). However, this is not the issue here, for it is undisputed that Ecuador assumed the obligations contained in the PSCs. Rather, the issue here is whether Burlington, as the investor, may invoke the obligations contained in those PSCs.\n\n194.\n\nEcuador also relies upon the annulment decision in *CMS v. Argentina (\"CMS\")*, where the *ad hoc Committee* held that \"[t]he effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else....[i]f this is so, it would appear that the parties to the obligation...are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause\" (Exh. CL-72, \u00b6 95). It should be noted that the wording of the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT applicable in *CMS* is identical to that of the US-Ecuador BIT.\n\n195.\n\nAccording to Respondent, *CMS* stated \"that *only if* there is privity [of contract] between claimant and respondent...[may] those contractual obligations be elevated to the level of a treaty breach through the umbrella clause\" (emphasis added) (Tr. 49:6-14). The Tribunal disagrees with Respondent's reading of *CMS*. It considers that, while the *ad hoc Committee* in *CMS* certainly raised concerns with respect to the scope of application of umbrella clauses, no general rule on that question may be extrapolated from that decision.\n\n196.\n\nIndeed, the *ad hoc Committee* annulled the *CMS* award for \"failure to state [the] reasons\" why CMS could invoke the umbrella clause against Argentina to enforce obligations of Argentina to TGN, a company of which CMS was a minority shareholder (*CMS Annulment*, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97). Because the award was annulled on this ground, the *ad hoc Committee* did not address the argument that the application of the umbrella clause by the *CMS* tribunal would have constituted manifest excess of power because of the lack of privity between CMS and Argentina. Accordingly, the reasons why the *CMS* award was ultimately annulled were *particular to that decision.* Arbitrator Stern takes exception to the analysis of *CMS presented in* \u00b6\u00b6 195-196.\n\n197.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have not sufficiently discussed the issue of the scope of the umbrella clause. Since Respondent raised the objection of lack of privity for the first time at the hearing on jurisdiction, the Parties have not presented their views in writing on this issue.\n\n198.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal decides to join to the merits its final determination on whether it has jurisdiction over Burlington's outstanding umbrella clause claims pending resolution of the question whether these claims require privity between Burlington and Ecuador (the \" *privity objection* \").\n\n199.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal declares that: (i) Burlington's second umbrella claim and the second limb of the third claim lapse on their own terms; (ii) Burlington's first umbrella claim and the first limb of the third umbrella claim do not raise \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty; (iii) Ecuador's additional objections, directed at Burlington's first umbrella clause claim and the first limb of the third umbrella clause claim, are rejected with the exception of its privity objection; (iv) the privity objection is joined to the merits; (v) the Parties may not re-argue or present new arguments on any jurisdictional issue other than the privity objection with respect to Burlington's outstanding umbrella clause claims.\n\n2) The claim for failure to provide fair and equitable treatment\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent has breached its obligation to provide Claimant fair and equitable treatment. This obligation is embodied in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, which provides as follows:\n\n\"Investment shall at all times *be accorded fair and equitable treatment*, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required under international law\" (emphasis added).\n\n201.\n\nClaimant supports its fair and equitable treatment claim on two main grounds. First, Respondent frustrated Claimant's legitimate expectations by repudiating its obligations to (i) absorb the effects of Law 42, (ii) exempt Claimant from Law 42, and (iii) guarantee Claimant a fixed share of crude oil production. These obligations arise from both the PSCs and the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. Second, Respondent has used its tax power in bad faith to force Claimant to give up its rights in the PSCs.\n\n202.\n\nClaimant's first fair and equitable treatment claim is based on the frustration of its legitimate expectations in relation to three distinct legal obligations. The Tribunal must therefore examine whether each of these legitimate expectations pose a challenge to Law 42 and thus raise \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty.\n\n203.\n\nFirst, Claimant's legitimate expectations were frustrated because Respondent failed to absorb the effects of Law 42 pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework and the PSCs. With regard to the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework, the Tribunal considers that Claimant had no right, in the absence of a contract, to be indemnified for the effects of new taxes or tax increases. With regard to the PSCs, the Tribunal has already concluded that the obligation to absorb the effects of new or increased taxes does not challenge Law 42 and, consequently, does not raise \"matters of taxation\" under Article X.\n\n204.\n\nYet, outside the umbrella clause context, a breach of contract by the State can amount to a Treaty breach only if the State's sovereign power is involved (*Duke Energy*, \u00b6 345). Otherwise stated, Respondent's purported repudiation of the tax indemnification clauses could result in a breach of fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty *only if Respondent's sovereign power were involved*. The Tribunal, however, has already determined that the contractual indemnification clauses do not involve the exercise of sovereign power11. Thus, this claim does not meet the relevant *prima facie* standard (\u00b6 110 above) because the facts alleged, even if proven, could not constitute a breach by Respondent of its Treaty obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment. Consequently, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this claim.\n\nWhile usually this would be an issue for the merits, the Tribunal was required to address this issue at this stage in order to determine whether Claimant's umbrella clause claims raised \"matters of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty.\n\n205.\n\nSecond, Claimant alleges that its legitimate expectations were disappointed because Respondent failed to exempt it from Law 42. The notion that the very application of Law 42 to Claimant results in a violation of the Treaty is inherent in this claim. In the view of the Tribunal, this claim thus poses a challenge to Law 42 and therefore raises \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty. This conclusion remains unaltered regardless of whether Respondent's obligation stems from the PSC or from the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework.\n\n206.\n\nThird, Claimant alleges that Respondent frustrated its legitimate expectation, independent of the other expectations, to have a fixed share of crude production. In the Tribunal's opinion, this claim challenges Law 42, for it is premised on the notion that Law 42 *itself* frustrated Claimant's expectation to have a fixed share of crude production12. This notion implies that Law 42 itself is unlawful because it breaches an obligation. Therefore, this claim also raises \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X.\n\nIt should be noted that, on this occasion, Claimant did not advance this claim to the extent that there was a violation of one of the previous two claims, as it did with respect to the umbrella clause claims. Rather, this claim was independent of the previous two claims\n\n207.\n\nClaimant's second fair and equitable treatment claim is that Respondent used its tax power in bad faith in order to force Claimant to surrender its rights under the PSCs. In the view of the Tribunal, this claim ostensibly challenges Law 42, as well as Respondent's tax power, and therefore raises \"matters of taxation\". Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a has taken exception to this finding.\n\n208.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that Burlington's fair and equitable treatment claim based on the alleged frustration of its legitimate expectation that the effects of any new taxes be absorbed by Ecuador does not meet the *prima facie* standard of jurisdiction pursuant to which, if later proven, the facts alleged must be susceptible of constituting a Treaty breach. The Tribunal further finds that Burlington's remaining fair and equitable treatment claims raise \"matters of taxation\" under Article X. Therefore, it will probe whether these latter claims relate to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an \"investment agreement\" in order to finally determine whether it can assert jurisdiction over them.\n\n3) The claim for arbitrary impairment\n-------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nClaimant maintains that Respondent has breached its obligation to refrain from enacting arbitrary measures that impair Claimant's investment. This obligation is incorporated in Article II(3)(b) of the Treaty, which sets forth that:\n\nNeither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments.\n\n210.\n\nClaimant supports this Treaty claim on the basis of a series of allegations. First, Respondent imposed an \"unlawful ta\"x that targeted \"Burlington's profits during a period of increasing oil prices\" (Mem., \u00b6 421). Second, Respondent enacted tax measures that \"suffocated\" Claimant's investment (*id*.). Third, Respondent \"aggressively pursued collection of Burlington's disputed debt by commencing the *coactiva* process\" (Mem., \u00b6 423). Finally, \"[f[rom the enactment of [Law 42]...Ecuador has created...an arbitrary framework for Burlington's investment\" (Mem., \u00b6 427).\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal deems that Claimant's allegations regarding arbitrary impairment challenge Law 42, and thus raise \"matters of taxation\" excluded from the scope of the Treaty in accordance with Article X. Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a has taken exception to this finding. Hence, the Tribunal will later examine whether this claim relates to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an \"investment agreement\" in order to determine its jurisdiction over this claim.\n\n4) The claim for failure to afford full protection and security\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nClaimant asserts that Respondent has breached its obligation to afford Claimant full protection and security in any of the Blocks. This obligation is articulated in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, which provides as follows:\n\nInvestment shall at all times...enjoy full protection and security.\n\n213.\n\nClaimant asserts that \"by discarding the legal framework governing\" Burlington's investment, Respondent \"has failed to provide legal and commercial security to Burlington's investments in Blocks 7, 21, 23, and 24.\" In particular, this failure materializes in \"the newly created legal regime [which] destroys the legal and commercial security of [Burlington's] investment\" (Mem., \u00b6 470).\n\n214.\n\nThe \"newly created legal regime\" to which Claimant refers is Law 42. Indeed, in the same paragraph, Claimant states that, if Blocks 23 and 24 were to reach \"the exploration and exploitation phases of the PSCs\", the \"eventual application of Law No. 2006-42 [Law 42]...would further contribute to the complete erosion of the legal and commercial value of [these Blocks]\" (Mem., \u00b6 470). In short, Claimant alleges that the application of Law 42 to Blocks 7 and 21 \"destroys\" the legal security of its investment, and that the eventual application of Law 42 to Blocks 23 and 24 would do as much (*id.).*\n\n215.\n\nOn the basis of these allegations, the Tribunal deems that Claimant's full protection and security claim, rooted in Ecuador's purported failure to provide *legal and commercial security* in Blocks 7, 21, 23 and 24, challenges Law 42 and thus raises \"matters of taxation\" under Article X. Accordingly, as is the case with the fair and equitable treatment claims and the arbitrary impairment claim, which also involve taxation matters, the Tribunal must ascertain whether this claim relates to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an \"investment agreement\" in order to determine its jurisdiction over this claim.\n\n216.\n\nThis claim, however, should be distinguished from Burlington's independent full protection and security claim for Ecuador's purported failure to provide *physical security* in Blocks 23 and 24 *due to the opposition of indigenous communities*. The Tribunal shall address Ecuador's objections with regard to this other claim in Section 3.3 below.\n\n**2.2.2 Observance and Enforcement of Terms of an \"Investment Agreement\" under Article X(2)(c) of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Ecuador's Arguments**\n--------------------------\n\n217.\n\nEcuador contends that Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims do not relate to the enforcement of an \"investment agreement\" as that term is used in Article X (OJ, \u00b6 34). It essentially supports this position with two arguments.\n\n218.\n\nFirst, Burlington itself is not a party to the PSCs and, therefore, the PSCs cannot be characterized as \"investment agreements\" for purposes of Article X(2)(c). Under Article VI(1)(a), to which Article X(2)(c) refers, an \"investment agreement\" is an agreement between a Party and \"a national or company of the other Party.\" Here, Ecuador is the Party and Burlington the \"national or company of the other Party\", namely, the United States. Yet, no investment agreement has been concluded between Ecuador and Burlington (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 40).\n\n219.\n\nEcuador claims that this conclusion is consonant with the decisions in *Duke Energy* and *EnCana.* In *Duke*, the tribunal, construing the Treaty applicable to this case, rejected claimant's attempt to characterize certain contracts as \"investment agreement[s]\" within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty on the ground that \"an investment agreement has to be one that ' *is between a State Party and a national or company of the other State Party'* \" (emphasis in original) (OJ, \u00b6 36; Tr. 36:1637:7).\n\n220.\n\nIn *EnCana*, the claimant, relying on a tax carve-out similar to that of Article X, sought to enforce PSCs entered into between subsidiaries incorporated in a third state and Ecuador. The tribunal held, however, that the contracts did not qualify as \"agreements\" under the tax carve-out on the ground that the claimant was not itself a party to the PSCs. As a result, claimant's treaty claims were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction (OJ, \u00b6 40).\n\n221.\n\nEcuador maintains that Burlington's arguments to the effect that Burlington is the \"real investor\", and that an investment is \"an indivisible whole\", bear no relevance. The question is not who the real investor is, but what the parties to the investment agreements are. Here, Burlington \"is not a signatory\" to the investment agreements, and therefore the \"third exception to Article \"x does not apply (Tr. 37:17-38:16).\n\n222.\n\nSecond, Ecuador argues that Article VI(8) of the Treaty \"has no bearing in the instant case\" (OJ, \u00b6 37). Under this provision, a \"company legally constituted under the [laws] of a Party\", which is controlled at the relevant time by a national or company of the other Party, shall be treated as a national of such other Party. Article VI(8) only applies when a company has been \"legally constituted under the [laws] of a Party\", that is, either in the United States or Ecuador. Yet, the Burlington Subsidiaries, parties to the PSCs, are incorporated in neither of these countries; rather, they are incorporated in Bermuda, and thus Burlington cannot rely upon this provision (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39).\n\n223.\n\nAs a result, Ecuador concludes that Burlington's Law 42 claims other than expropriation should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction (\u00b6\u00b6 40-41).\n\n**B. Burlington's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n224.\n\nBurlington maintains that its claims relate to the enforcement of an \"investment agreement\" pursuant to Article X(2)(c) of the Treaty (CM, \u00b6 39).\n\n225.\n\nThe proper approach to construe the term \"investment agreement\", Burlington argues, is one that focuses upon the economic substance of the investment, as opposed to its form. In accordance with this substantive approach, Burlington is the real party to the investment agreement, viewed as a whole, underlying this dispute. The fact that it has invested through special purpose vehicles incorporated in Bermuda does not alter this conclusion (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 45, 50).\n\n226.\n\nBurlington points to four facts in support of its proposition that, as opposed to its Subsidiaries, it is the real party to the investment agreement. First, Ecuador approached and targeted Burlington, knowing all along that Burlington, and not its Subsidiaries, was the real investor (CM, \u00b6 41). Second, Burlington's claims are broader than the PSCs because they are also based on the legal guarantees set out in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework (CM, \u00b6 42).\n\n227.\n\nThird, although Burlington is not a signatory to the PSCs, it did provide, through its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, Burlington Resources International Inc., performance guarantees \"covering all of its Bermudian subsidiaries' obligations under the PSCs.\" As a result, \"Ecuador has the right to enforce the PSC obligations against Burlington\" (CM, \u00b6 43). Finally, when Law 42 and Decree 662 were passed, it was Burlington, \"as the real party in interest\", that requested compliance with the tax indemnification provisions of the PSCs (CM, \u00b6 44).\n\n228.\n\nBurlington notes that there is a consistent body of ICSID jurisprudence focusing on the economic reality of investments, as opposed to their formal set-up. In *Enron Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (\" *Enron* \"), for instance, the tribunal, echoing the notion that an investment is an \"indivisible whole\", rejected the argument that a transfer agreement was not an investment agreement because the agreement was entered into by a local gas company but not by the claimant. The reasoning behind *Enron* is consistent with that of *Holiday Inns v. Morocco* (\" *Holiday Inns* \") and with numerous other ICSID decisions that followed suit (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 45-49).\n\n229.\n\nBurlington asserts that Ecuador cannot benefit from Burlington's investment and attendant guarantees and at the same time seek to avoid Burlington's exercise of its rights with respect to those investments (CM, \u00b6 50).\n\n230.\n\nFinally, Burlington submits that its interpretation of the term \"investment agreement\" is the only one that comports with both the object and purpose of the Treaty, namely, to promote foreign investment, and with the broad definition of \"investment\" under Article I(a), which encompasses both direct and indirect investments (CM, \u00b6 51-52).\n\n**C. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims which raise \"matters of taxation\", namely, the fair and equitable treatment, the arbitrary impairment, and the full protection and security claims, relate to the observance and enforcement of an investment agreement within the meaning of Article X(2)(c). Article X, in its relevant portions, refers to Article VI(1):\n\n\"Article X.\n\n[T]he provisions of this Treaty...shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n\u2026\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an *investment* *agreement* or authorization as referred to in Article VI (1) (a)....[...]\" (emphasis added).\n\n232.\n\nArticle VI(1) in turn provides as follows:\n\n\"Article VI.\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an *investment agreement* between that Party and such national or company...\" (emphasis added).\n\n233.\n\nUnder these provisions, there is jurisdiction over Burlington's Law 42 nonexpropriation claims insofar as these claims relate to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment agreement. Conversely, there is no jurisdiction over these claims if they do *not* relate to such an observance and enforcement.\n\n234.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether there is an investment agreement between them within the meaning of Article VI(1)(a), to which Article X(2)(c) refers. Claimant argues that Burlington is the \"real investor\" and that, based on this economic reality, there is an investment agreement between Burlington and Ecuador. Respondent objects that there is no investment agreement because (i) the PSCs were not entered into between Claimant and Respondent and (ii) the economic reality of the investment is irrelevant for purposes of defining an investment agreement.\n\n235.\n\nThe Treaty contains no definition of the term investment agreement. However, under Article VI(1), the Treaty provides that the \"investment agreement\" must be entered into \"between [a] Party and [a] national or company of the other Party.\" In accordance with this requirement, the PSCs are not investment agreements. Indeed, while Ecuador qualifies as a Party to the Treaty, the Burlington Subsidiaries which entered into the PSCs are incorporated in Bermuda and thus are not nationals or companies \"of the other Party\" to the Treaty, that is, the United States. Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a has taken exception to this finding.\n\n236.\n\nClaimant proposes an \"economic approach\" to the concept of \"investment agreement\", and argues that a number of ICSID decisions adopted such approach. However, the \"economic approach\" endorsed by those ICSID tribunals refers to the avowedly capacious concept of \"investment\", not to the more restrictive concept of \"investment agreement.\"\n\n237.\n\nIn particular, the decisions upon which Claimant expressly relies, to wit, *Enron* and *Holiday Inns*, including the quotations that Claimant brings to the attention of the Tribunal, refer to the concept of \"investment\", not to the concept of \"investment agreement.\" In consequence, these decisions are inapposite to ascertain the meaning of \"investment agreement\" here in question.\n\n238.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considers that, while it makes sense to adopt an economic approach in relation to the concept of \"investment\", the concept of \"agreement\" is one that more naturally lends itself to a legal approach. This does not mean that economic considerations should be wholly alien to the concept of \"investment agreement\". It simply means that it is the law and not economics that generally sets the contours of what qualifies as an \"agreement.\"\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support for a legal approach to the notion of \"investment agreement\" in the *Duke Energy* and *EnCana* decisions *.* In *Duke Energy*, the tribunal found that the investor and Ecuador had not entered into an \"investment agreement\" because claimant had not \"signed \" the contracts in question, nor had it assumed any \"obligations\" under those contracts. In *EnCana*, the tribunal similarly held that there was no agreement preventing the application of the tax carve-out of the Canada-Ecuador BIT because the PSCs in question in that case had not been \" *concluded* by the investor in these proceedings...but by its third-State-incorporated subsidiaries\" (emphasis added) (EL-45, \u00b6 167).\n\n240.\n\nIn sum, the *Duke Energy* and *EnCana* tribunals' focus on the signature or conclusion of the contract, and on the obligations assumed thereunder, shows that they adopted a legal rather than an economic approach to the meaning of \"investment agreement.\" This Tribunal will also adopt that approach.\n\n241.\n\nClaimant argues that four facts indicate that there was an investment agreement between Claimant and Respondent. First, Respondent targeted Claimant. Second, Claimant's claims are broader than the PSCs as it includes rights stemming from the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. Third, Claimant has given parent company guarantees in connection with the PSCs. Fourth, when the Law 42 dispute arose, Claimant, acting as the \"real party in interest\", requested Respondent to comply with its tax indemnification obligations under the PSCs.\n\n242.\n\nFirst, the fact that Claimant was \"targeted\" by Respondent corroborates Burlington's economic interest in the investment and, ultimately, Burlington's status as the real investor behind the investment. Yet, this does not establish the existence of an investment agreement between Claimant and Respondent.\n\n243.\n\nSecond, while Claimant's rights could arguably derive from Ecuadorian law in addition to the PSCs, the Tribunal does not consider that this possibility lends support to Claimant's argument that there is an investment agreement between Claimant and Respondent. In the view of the Tribunal, the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework did not create an investment agreement between Claimant and Respondent within the meaning of Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n244.\n\nIndeed, the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework was unilaterally enacted by Ecuador in the exercise of its sovereign power \u2013 as is generally the case with any piece of legislation. By contrast, an investment agreement must be entered into between two specific parties, *i.e.* \"a Party [to the Treaty] and a national or company of the other Party\", and does not necessarily involve the State's exercise of its sovereign power.\n\n245.\n\nThird, Claimant argues that there was an investment agreement because it undertook to guarantee the obligations of its Subsidiaries under the PSCs. In the view of the Tribunal, these guarantees do not give rise to an investment agreement between Claimant and Respondent. Claimant did not assume these guarantees directly, but through a third wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary which was otherwise wholly alien to Burlington's investment in Ecuador. Thus, Burlington was only a second-degree guarantor.\n\n246.\n\nMoreover, Burlington's second-degree guarantees are unilateral undertakings assumed exclusively for Ecuador's benefit. The Tribunal therefore cannot see how Burlington could rely upon these unilateral undertakings as evidence in support of an agreement which is by definition bilateral. Finally, even if these unilateral undertakings could somehow be considered an \"investment agreements\" under the Treaty, Burlington could still not avail itself of the Article X(2)(c) exception because this dispute does not relate to \"the observance and enforcement\" of Burlington's obligations under the guarantees, but rather to \"the observance and enforcement\" of *Ecuador's obligations* under the Treaty and possibly, via the Treaty, under the PSCs.\n\n247.\n\nFourth, the fact that Claimant, as \"the real party in interest\", requested Respondent to comply with the tax indemnification provisions contained in the PSCs shows, once again, Claimant's economic stake in the investment. Yet, as was the case with the first fact invoked by Claimant, this does not establish the existence of an investment agreement between Claimant and Respondent. Even if considered cumulatively, the four facts enumerated by Claimant fail to establish the existence of a bilateral investment agreement between Claimant and Respondent.\n\n248.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant and Respondent have not entered into an investment agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty, and therefore Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims do not relate to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment agreement within the meaning of Article X(2)(c).\n\n249.\n\nSince Burlington's Law 42 non-expropriation claims do not relate to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment agreement, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that it has no jurisdiction over those Law 42 non-expropriation claims which raise \"matters of taxation\" within the meaning of Article X, *i.e.*, (i) the fair and equitable treatment claim (at \u00b6 208), (ii) the arbitrary impairment claim (at \u00b6 211); and (iii) the full protection and security claim (at \u00b6 215).\n\n**2.3 Objection to Jurisdiction in Respect of the Full Protection and Security Claim for Blocks 23 and 24**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nEcuador's third objection to jurisdiction is directed at Burlington's full protection and security claim for lack of *physical security* in Blocks 23 and 24 due to the opposition of local indigenous communities. It raises the following two issues:\n\n(i) Has Burlington complied with the requirements of Article VI of the Treaty prior to submitting this dispute to ICSID arbitration?\n\n(ii) Has Burlington perfected consent to arbitrate these claims before Ecuador withdrew its offer to arbitrate this class of disputes pursuant to Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention?\n\n**2.3.1 Has Burlington Complied with the Requirements of Article VI Prior to Submitting this Dispute to ICSID Arbitration?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Ecuador's Arguments**\n--------------------------\n\n251.\n\nEcuador argues that Burlington failed to comply with the requirements of Article VI of the Treaty in connection with its full protection and security claim for Blocks 23 and 24. The requirements of Article VI are prerequisites for \"the validity of the investor's \"consent\" to ICSID arbitration\". As a result, Burlington's full protection and security claim for Blocks 23 and 24 should be barred for lack of jurisdiction (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 67, 69, 75).\n\n252.\n\nPursuant to Article VI of the BIT, an investor may submit a dispute to ICSID arbitration only if *inter alia*, the following three cumulative conditions are met: (i) there is a dispute, (ii) the investor provides notice of the dispute containing one or more allegations of Treaty breach, and (ii) six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, that is, from the date of the alleged Treaty breach (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66)13.\n\nAn additional requirement under the Treaty is that the investor must not have submitted the dispute either to the courts of the Contracting Parties or to any other form of dispute settlement mechanism. Burlington's compliance with this requirement is not disputed by Ecuador (OJ, \u00b6 66).\n\n253.\n\nEcuador founds its objection on the following:\n\n1) There was never a dispute in relation to Blocks 23 and 24;\n\n2) Even if there was a dispute, Burlington did not provide proper notice of it to Ecuador; and\n\n3) Thus, Burlington did not comply with the six-month waiting period requirement in Article VI of the Treaty.\n\n*i) There was never a dispute in relation to Blocks 23 and 24*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nEcuador alleges that \"there was no dispute in relation to Blocks 23 and 24\" for the following three reasons (Tr. 56:14-16).\n\n255.\n\nFirst, there was never \"a disagreement between the parties\" in relation to the indigenous opposition in Blocks 23 and 24 (Tr. 59:10-16).\n\n256.\n\nSecond, the Blocks were under *force majeure* status. A declaration of *force majeure* amounts precisely to a recognition that the events in question are beyond the control of the Parties. In particular, under the PSCs, both parties were exempt from liability for the situation obtaining in the Blocks. Therefore, \"if there is no potential liability arising from [the PSCs], there cannot be any real dispute\" (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Tr. 60:8-17).\n\n257.\n\nThird, as an additional token that there was no dispute, Ecuador points out that \"there was clear collaboration between the parties to solve the issue\" in the Blocks concerning the indigenous opposition (Tr. 61:5-12).\n\n*ii) Burlington did not provide proper notice of the dispute to Ecuador*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nIn the alternative, if there was a dispute, Burlington did not provide Ecuador with proper notice of the dispute. In particular, Burlington did not properly advise Ecuador of an alleged breach of the full protection and security provision of the Treaty in relation to Blocks 23 and 24 until the filing of its Request for Arbitration, in disregard of the notice requirements contained in Article VI of the BIT. (OJ, \u00b6 64; Tr. 53:21-24).\n\n259.\n\nIn *Lauder v. Czech Republic*, the tribunal, faced with a provision with wording similar to that of Article VI, clearly stated \"the need for a notice of the dispute.\" As a result, Burlington's failure to comply with this requirement should foreclose jurisdiction over these claims, in consonance with the ICSID decision in *Enron v. Argentine Republic*. (OJ, \u00b6 67; Tr. 56:2-5; 69:17-70:12).\n\n260.\n\nThe letters on which Burlington relies to claim that Ecuador was apprised of the dispute actually failed to give proper notice of the dispute in accordance with Article VI of the Treaty (OJ, \u00b6 69; Tr. 56:18-21). First, the 4 December 2002 letter, through which Burlington claims to have advised Ecuador of a dispute in relation to Block 23, \"was sent by CGC, not Burlington\", \"only refers to the question of *force majeure* \", and contains no allegation of \"any treaty breach\" (Tr. 62:17-63:15).\n\n261.\n\nSecond, the 6 December 2000 letter, through which Burlington claims to have advised Ecuador of a dispute in relation to Block 24, again \"is only referring to the *force majeure* question\" and contains no allegation of any \"breach of treaty\" (Tr. 63:16-64:2)\n\n262.\n\nThird, while Burlington refers to \"repeated communications advising [Ecuador] of the dispute\", these communications \"do not refer to any disagreement [nor] to any treaty breach\" (Tr. 64:3-16).\n\n263.\n\nFourth, Burlington sent to Ecuador four identical notices on 11 October 2007 (the so-called \"Trigger Letters\") alleging various BIT breaches in connection with its interests in Blocks 7, 21, 23 and 24. However, the Trigger Letters referred only to Law 42 breaches, and omitted any reference to Ecuador's purported failure to provide full protection and security against opposition from local indigenous groups in Blocks 23 and 24 (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69). While Burlington employed the expression \"among other Government measures\" in the Trigger Letters, this expression is insufficient to give notice of a specific and different dispute in Blocks 23 and 24 due to the opposition local indigenous communities. Most importantly, Ecuador argues, the Trigger Letters constitute Burlington's express recognition that it was bound to comply with the requirements of Article VI prior to submitting the dispute to ICSID arbitration (OJ, \u00b6 68; Tr. 64:17-65-17).\n\n264.\n\nEcuador also contends that the onus is on the \"Claimant to demonstrate with clear evidence that any further negotiations with the Respondent host State would be futile...[and yet Burlington presented] no evidence whatsoever on record of this point\" (Tr. 69:5-16).\n\n265.\n\nFinally, in omitting to put Ecuador on notice of its failure to provide full protection and security in connection with Blocks 23 and 24, Burlington in effect prevented Ecuador from taking steps to address the situation and from engaging in meaningful negotiations (OJ, \u00b6 70; Tr. 67:3-68:13).\n\n266.\n\nIn sum, Ecuador concludes, Burlington has made \"an opportunistic use of [its] Request for Arbitration to advance frivolous Treaty claims in relation to Blocks 23 and 24\" (OJ, \u00b6 74).\n\n**B. Burlington's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n267.\n\nBurlington contends that it complied with the requirements of Article VI of the Treaty in connection with its full protection and security claim for Blocks 23 and 24 prior to submitting this dispute to ICSID arbitration. Burlington notes that, in accordance with Article VI, it only submitted this claim to ICSID arbitration six months after the date on which the dispute arose (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 55-57, 62).\n\n268.\n\nContrary to what Ecuador alleges, Burlington claims that (i) there was a dispute in relation to Blocks 23 and 24; (ii) the BIT has no formal notice requirement; and (iii) Ecuador learned of the existence of the dispute on numerous occasions. Therefore, Burlington complied with the requirements of Article VI.\n\n(i) *The disputes in Blocks 23 and 24 arose soon after Burlington's investment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nBurlington maintains that a dispute arose in Blocks 23 and 24 shortly after Burlington acquired ownership interests in the PSCs for the exploration and exploitation of those Blocks. The dispute was brought about by the opposition of local indigenous communities to hydrocarbon operations in those Blocks (CM, \u00b6 58).\n\n270.\n\nSpecifically, a dispute arose when Burlington made its \"initial requests for protection and security from the indigenous opposition in Blocks 23 and 24.\" The first request for protection was made as early as 6 October 2000 for Block 24 and 4 December 2002 for Block 23. These initial requests were followed by \"repeated communications\" to the same effect (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 58, 61).\n\n271.\n\nBurlington points that Ecuador's argument that the *force majeure* status of the Blocks signified that no party was responsible for the situation obtaining in the Blocks \"is a question for the merits\" (CM, \u00b6 61 n.76).\n\n*(ii) The BIT has no formal notice requirement*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nBurlington argues that, contrary to Ecuador's allegation, there is no notice requirement under Article VI of the Treaty. There is no need for Claimant to \"advise[] formally of the existence of a dispute....All that needs to be established is that a dispute existed within the meaning of the treaty for more than six months, and then that consent was validly provided\" (Tr. 116:19-117:5). In addition, for a dispute to exist no \"specific allegation of a Treaty breach\" is required, but merely \"evidence that a dispute has arisen.\" Once a dispute \"arises\", the purpose of the six-month waiting period is to give the State an opportunity to redress the problem (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60).\n\n273.\n\nIn spite of such purpose, when Burlington informed Ecuador of the violation of its Treaty right in the dispute resulting from the enactment of Law 42, \"no machinery of the Government was made known to Burlington such that negotiations went forward with respect to [those] treaty claims\" (Tr. 84:19-22).\n\n274.\n\nAccording to Burlington, tribunals do not require claimants to articulate all of their claims during the period of amicable settlement, recognizing that this approach would be overly formalistic and could hinder the negotiation process. In its letters to Ecuador, Burlington did not need to spell out its legal claims in detail, but merely to make reference to its rights \"in general terms\" (CM, \u00b6 67; Tr. 125:5-15). In *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, for instance, the tribunal held that \"[t]he requirement to consult and negotiate...does not serve to compel the investor to plead its legal case on multiple occasions. To insist upon [specific articulation of the investor's legal claims] would only have a chilling effect on consultation and negotiation\" (CM, \u00b6 67; Tr. 125:16-126:2).\n\n*(iii) Ecuador learned of the existence of the dispute on numerous occasions*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nBurlington alleges that Ecuador knew of the existence of a dispute in Blocks 23 and 24 more than six months before Burlington filed its Request for Arbitration on 21 April 2008 (CM, \u00a7 C.1). In particular, Ecuador learned about the existence of this dispute at the following three different points in time:\n\n(i) First, shortly after Burlington made its investment in these Blocks, that is, in 2000 for Block 24 and in 2002 for Block 23;\n\n(ii) Second, when Ecuador received Burlington's 11 October 2007 notices, i.e., the \"Trigger Letters\";\n\n(iii) Third, when Burlington filed its Request for Arbitration in April 2008 (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 68-69, 70-71).\n\n276.\n\nFirst, soon after it invested in Blocks 23 and 24, Burlington informed Ecuador of the difficulties it was facing in these Blocks due to opposition from local communities. As mentioned before, Burlington made initial requests for protection and security on 6 October 2000 for Block 24 and on 4 December 2002 for Block 23. Burlington repeatedly reiterated these requests by addressing letters to PetroEcuador, to Governors and to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 58, 61).\n\n277.\n\nAccording to Burlington, there are two letters which are \"emblematic of the broader tenor of [the] discussions\" taking place between Burlington and Ecuador. This tenor is one which sufficiently apprised Ecuador of the disputes in the Blocks due to the indigenous opposition. The first letter refers to Block 24 and is date-marked 31 January 2005; the second letter refers to Block 23 and is date-marked 21 December 2005 (Tr. 124:4-25; 129:18-25).\n\n278.\n\nMoreover, as Ministerial Decree No. 197 of 23 April 1999 demonstrates, Ecuador knew that indigenous groups opposed the exploitation of Blocks 23 and 24 and that it was under an obligation to address those issues (CM, \u00b6 60).\n\n279.\n\nSecond, even if these letters did not sufficiently inform Ecuador of the dispute with Burlington in connection with Blocks 23 and 24, the Trigger Letters did. The Trigger Letters explicitly stated that Ecuador's inaction resulted in a violation of its obligations to provide full protection and security for these Blocks (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 63-65).\n\n280.\n\nBurlington's allegations in the Trigger Letters were not limited to Law 42 measures. Indeed, the Trigger Letters stated that Law 42 measures, \" *among other Government's measures* \", constituted a breach of Ecuador's obligation to accord full protection and security to Burlington's investment in the Blocks (emphasis added by Claimant) (CM, \u00b6 64). In the context of Burlington's previous letters of protest and request for assistance, reference to these \"other\" measures necessarily included Ecuador's inaction in connection with Blocks 23 and 24 (CM, \u00b6 65).\n\n281.\n\nTherefore, the Trigger Letters apprised with sufficient detail the existence of a dispute in connection with Blocks 23 and 24, placing Ecuador in a position to take steps to resolve the dispute amicably. This is all that is required under the Treaty, which imposes no formal notice obligation (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 68-69).\n\n282.\n\nThird and finally, Ecuador was once again made aware of the existence of the dispute when Burlington filed its Request for Arbitration on 21 April 2008. In its Request for Arbitration, Burlington detailed all the facts and the law of the dispute concerning Ecuador's alleged failure to accord full protection and security to Burlington's investment in Blocks 23 and 24 (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 70-71).\n\n283.\n\nIn sum, Burlington complied with Article VI of the Treaty because it submitted the dispute in connection with Blocks 23 and 24 to ICSID arbitration more than six months after the date on which the dispute arose (CM, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62).\n\n**C. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether Claimant complied with the requirements of Article VI of the Treaty in relation to its full protection and security claims for Blocks 23 and 24. In its relevant part, Article VI of the Treaty provides the following:\n\n\"1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n[....]\n\n3. (a) Provided that...six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration [to the ICSID].\"\n\n285.\n\nThe Parties disagree on two main issues. First, while it is common ground that Article VI requires the existence of a dispute, the Parties disagree on whether there actually was a dispute in this case with respect to Blocks 23 and 24. Second, the Parties disagree on whether Article VI requires the would-be claimant to provide notice of the dispute containing allegations of the Treaty rights that were purportedly breached and, if so, whether Burlington met this requirement.\n\n286.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal must analyze (i) whether there was a dispute in connection with Blocks 23 and 24 and (ii) whether Burlington was under an obligation to provide notice of the dispute to Ecuador containing allegations of Treaty breach and, if so, (iii) whether Burlington complied with this obligation.\n\n(i) *Was There a Dispute in connection with Blocks 23 and 24?*\n\n287.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that Article VI of the Treaty requires the existence of a dispute. The Parties also agree on the meaning of the term \"dispute\" under Article VI(3) of the Treaty.\n\n288.\n\nClaimant has stated that a \"dispute\" is a \"disagreement\" between the parties \"as to what their obligations or rights are\"; in addition, both parties need to be aware of this \"disagreement\" (Tr. 232:22-233:11). Similarly, Respondent has stated that there is a dispute when there is a \"disagreement between the parties....an opposition of interests and views\", and \"for a disagreement to exist, someone has to say to the other side, \"We disagree on something. You are not doing something\"\" (Tr. 58:10:13; 216:21-24).\n\n289.\n\nIn sum, both Parties agree that a \"dispute\" under Article VI entails (i) a disagreement between the parties on their rights and obligations, an opposition of interests and views, and (ii) an expression of this disagreement, so that both parties are aware of the disagreement. The Tribunal agrees with this definition, and will now apply it to the facts of this case.\n\n290.\n\nClaimant stated that it made initial requests for protection and security on 6 October 2000 for Block 24, and on 4 December 2003 for Block 23. For chronological reasons, therefore, the Tribunal will focus first on Block 24.\n\n(i) Was There a Dispute in Block 24?\n------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nClaimant alleges that it first required protection for Block 24 by letter of 6 October 2000 addressed to the Ministry of Energy and Mines and to PetroEcuador. In the letter, Claimant stated that it was writing:\n\n\"[T]o notify that there is a *Force Majeure* scenario in accordance with [the PSC for Block 24[...]. Burlington continues to face active opposition from the indigenous communities residing in Block 24[...]. Burlington declares that the conditions described....constitute *Force Majeure* \" (Tribunal's translation)(Exh. C-142).\n\n292.\n\nWhile the 6 October 2000 letter refers to the fact that \"Burlington continues to face active opposition from the indigenous communities residing in Block 24\", this is only mentioned as the reason why the Block should be declared in *force majeure*. However, the 6 October 2000 letter contains no request for protection and security, nor does it evidence any disagreement concerning the level of security that Ecuador was providing in the Block.\n\n293.\n\nThe purpose of the 6 October 2000 letter, as Claimant itself acknowledged in its Memorial, was to \"avoid a breach of its obligation to timely perform....under the PSC\" (Mem., \u00b6 184). The Tribunal agrees with Respondent's view that this letter \"is only referring to the *force majeure* question\" (Tr. 63:16-64:2). Thus, this letter fails to raise a \"dispute\" within the meaning of Article VI of the Treaty.\n\n294.\n\nHowever, Claimant argues that it sent other repeated communications to Respondent requesting protection and security for Block 24. Claimant refers in particular to its letter dated 31 January 2005 as \"emblematic\" of the tenor of the discussions taking place between Claimant and Respondent (Tr. 128:19-25). In light of Claimant's own characterization, this letter warrants special attention.\n\n295.\n\nClaimant's letter of 31 January 2005 comprises three pages addressed by Mr. Vickers, of Burlington Ecuador, to the Ministry of Energy and Mines and to Ecuador. In its relevant portions, it states:\n\n\"During 2004, Block 24 continued to be under *force majeure* status due to the difficulties in reaching agreements with the local and indigenous communities that would allow [Burlington Resources] to access and begin with the exploration activities.\n\nMost of Burlington's efforts during 2004 were directed at establishing a clear and open dialogue with the different communities and indigenous groups in the Block that would allow to reach agreements and to begin operations. *Likewise, Burlington worked jointly with agencies of the Ministry of Energy and Mines in order to seek to reach a solution and to settle once and for all the present situation.*\n\nBurlington Resources *has worked jointly with the Government* and the indigenous people in order to develop a program that would benefit the indigenous people residing in the Block....[program description follows].\n\n\u2026\n\nThrough this proposal, the indigenous people residing in this area will be able to participate directly in the economic benefits deriving from oil activities in the Block. Regrettably, *although the Government as well as the indigenous people seem to be open to and supportive of this proposal*, there is thus far no definitive solution to the *Force Majeure* situation.\n\nTowards the end of 2004, there seemed to be some progress in the negotiations as a result of the community help offer previously indicated as well as *the support of the Government* to assemble the indigenous people around a negotiation table in order to secure access to Block 24. This apparent progress encountered once again the pressures of indigenous groups commanded by external groups....\n\n\u2026\n\nUnfortunately....Burlington fears that no agreement will be reached within a short time....\n\n*We hope that within the coming weeks the Government take action, that it proceed emphatically and that it solve these matters*, in such a way that Burlington Resources will not be compelled to opt for [] the Deep Freeze *Force Majeure* alternative.\n\nAs it was previously mentioned, Burlington Resources remains optimistic that the efforts made will allow to reach the necessary agreements in order to begin with the exploration program in Block 24 (Tribunal's translation) (emphases added)(Exh. C-147).\n\n296.\n\nFrom the letter, three observations may be drawn. First, Claimant indicates, on four occasions, that Respondent has assisted Claimant in some form or another in dealing with the indigenous opposition in the Block. Second, towards the end of the letter, Claimant states \"its hope that within the next few weeks the Government take action and that it proceed emphatically and that it solve these matters.\" Finally, the letter ends on an optimistic note, with Claimant expressing confidence that a final agreement with the indigenous communities could be reached.\n\n297.\n\nClaimant's expectation that Respondent \"take action and that it proceed emphatically and that it solve these matters\" is the only portion of the letter that could plausibly bear any relevance to the existence of a \"dispute.\" However, in the view of the Tribunal, this expectation is insufficient to rise to the requisite level of \"dispute\" within the meaning of Article VI(3) of the Treaty.\n\n298.\n\nWhile Claimant's expectation is conceivably a diplomatic request for further assistance in connection with the indigenous opposition in the Block, this request for assistance does not express disagreement with the manner in which the Respondent has fulfilled its obligation to provide protection and security in the Block. In and of itself, a request for assistance does not express disagreement on the parties' rights and obligations are, unless the surrounding context suggests otherwise, *i.e.* that the party whose assistance is requested has thus far failed to abide by its duty to assist.\n\n299.\n\nHowever, the context of the request for assistance, far from suggesting that Respondent has not done enough or has failed to abide by its duty, focuses on the progress made in part *thanks to* the assistance of Respondent. The letter also ends on an optimistic note, indicative of auspicious circumstances. At no point in the letter does Claimant express disagreement with the way Respondent has discharged its obligation to provide full protection and security in the Block.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal has also reviewed the remaining correspondence for Block 24 sent by Claimant before the Trigger Letter, and concludes that they also fail to manifest disagreement in relation to Respondent's obligation to provide full protection and security in the Block (Exhs. C-144, C-145, C-146, C-148 and C-150).\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that it can be difficult to find an adequate balance between diplomacy and assertiveness. Mr. Vickers, who signed many of the letters sent by Claimant to Respondent, stated at the hearing: \" *When you are seeking assistance from a Government, you are not going to tell them, \"You are not doing* *anything.\" You are going to say...\"I appreciate what you have been doing\".....\"but I* *need you to do a lot more*.\"\" (Tr. 155:20-156:3). Nonetheless, this difficulty cannot dispense Claimant from voicing a disagreement as required by Article VI of the Treaty.\n\n302.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal finds that Ministerial Decree No. 197 of 23 April 1999 does not show that Respondent knew that there was a dispute with Claimant in relation to the purported lack of protection and security in Block 24. In its relevant part, Ministerial Decree No. 197 states that:\n\n\"[T]he Government of Ecuador....shall coordinate and carry out the necessary policies and actions in order that the petroleum industry, declared to be necessary to the public interest, may perform its activities normally (CM, \u00b6 60).\"\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant only acquired its interest in Block 24 on 9 May 2000. For that reason, the Tribunal fails to see how the Ministerial Decree, dated 23 April 1999, could show any disagreement *with Claimant*, who at the time of the Decree held no interest in this Block.\n\n304.\n\nIn any event, the Decree expresses no *disagreement* in relation to Respondent's purported failure to comply with its obligation to provide protection and security in the Block due to the indigenous opposition. The Decree simply articulates Respondent's general policy in relation to the petroleum industry, and could at best be construed as an acknowledgement that such industry was facing problems.\n\n305.\n\nIn light of these conclusions, the Tribunal must now examine whether the so-called Trigger Letter for Block 24 apprised Respondent of a dispute in relation to its obligation to provide protection and security in the Block.\n\n306.\n\nThe Trigger Letter for Block 24 is dated 11 October 2007 and reads as follows:\n\nOn March 29, 2006, the Government passed Law No. 2006-42, which together with Decree No. 1672 of July 11, 2006, imposed a new, unilateral 50% participation of the Government in the so-called excessive prices (\"excedentes de precio\") of crude oil, among other measures. On October 4, 2007, the Government issued Decree No. 662, which unilaterally increased this 50% unilateral participation in the excessive prices to 99%. Law No. 2006-42, Decree No. 1672, and Decree No. 662, *among other Government's measures*, manifestly alter the conditions upon which the Companies invested in Ecuador, severely impair the viability of Burlington Resources' investment in Ecuador, and have substantially damaged Burlington Resources' investment and its value.\n\nThese measures, *among others*, constitute a breach of Ecuador's obligations under the BIT toward Burlington Resources' investment in Ecuador, *including but not limited to* the obligations to (i) accord fair and equitable treatment to investments, (ii) *accord full protection and security to investments*, (iii) not to impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of investments, (iv) observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments, and (v) not to expropriate or nationalize investments, either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization, except for a public purpose, in a non-discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation, and in accordance with the due process of law and the general principles of treatment established in Article II(3) of the BIT (emphases added by Claimant) (Exh. C-45).\n\n307.\n\nClaimant argues that the Trigger Letter explicitly states that Respondent has violated its obligation to provide full protection and security against the indigenous opposition in the Block because the letter refers to Law 42 and \" *other\"* measures; and the reference to \" *other* \" measures, construed in the context of Claimant's previous letters of protest, necessarily includes such violation by Respondent. The Tribunal cannot follow this line of argument.\n\n308.\n\nAs the Tribunal just concluded, Claimant's letters prior to the Trigger Letter failed to apprise Respondent of a dispute in relation to its obligation to provide protection and security in the Block. If these letters failed to apprise Respondent of such a dispute, the Tribunal does not to see how they could provide the relevant context to construe the reference to \"other\" measures in the Trigger Letter as apprising Respondent of such dispute.\n\n309.\n\nFurther, in the absence of relevant context from previous letters, the reference to \"other\" measures is insufficient to apprise Respondent of a dispute in relation to its obligation to provide protection and security in the Block *due to the opposition of the indigenous communities*. In short, the Trigger Letter does not articulate Claimant's disagreement with a reasonable degree of specificity.\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal must next examine whether Claimant sufficiently apprised Respondent of the dispute when it filed its Request for Arbitration on 21 April 2008.\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the Request for Arbitration adequately apprises Respondent of a dispute in relation to its protection and security obligation in Block 24 due to the opposition of the indigenous communities. In the Request, after briefly describing the problem of the opposition of the local indigenous communities in the Block, Claimant concludes that \"Ecuador has failed to provide [to Burlington] any real support in resolving the problems, and has failed to provide security to Burlington's installations, personnel and hydrocarbons activities\" (RFA, \u00b6 79).\n\n312.\n\nHowever, the Request for Arbitration is too late a time to apprise Respondent of a dispute. The six-month waiting period requirement of Article VI is designed precisely to provide the State with an opportunity to redress the dispute before the investor decides to submit the dispute to arbitration. Claimant has only informed Respondent of this dispute *with the submission* of the dispute to ICSID arbitration, thereby depriving Respondent of the opportunity, accorded by the Treaty, to redress the dispute *before* it is submitted to arbitration.\n\n313.\n\nIn connection with the dispute arising from the enactment of Law 42, Claimant has stated that \"no machinery of the Government [of Ecuador] was made known to Burlington such that negotiations went forward with respect to [that dispute]\" (Tr. 84:19-22). This comment would suggest that negotiations between Claimant and Respondent would have proven futile in connection with the problem of the indigenous opposition in Block 24. Two observations are warranted in this regard.\n\n314.\n\nFirst, according to Claimant's own account of events, the facts underlying the dispute in Block 24 due to the indigenous opposition chronologically preceded the Law 42 dispute by over five years. In the view of the Tribunal, the fact that negotiations proved futile in this second dispute does not mean that negotiations over a prior, unrelated dispute would have similarly proven futile. In any event, Claimant has not stated, nor has it advanced any evidence, suggesting that negotiations would have proven futile.\n\n315.\n\nSecond, by imposing upon investors an obligation to voice their disagreement at least six months prior to the submission of an investment dispute to arbitration, the Treaty effectively accords host States the right to be informed about the dispute at least six months before it is submitted to arbitration. The purpose of this right is to grant the host State an *opportunity* to redress the problem before the investor submits the dispute to arbitration. In this case, Claimant has deprived the host State of that opportunity. That suffices to defeat jurisdiction.\n\n316.\n\nIn light of the preceding considerations, the Tribunal finds that, prior to the filing of the Request for Arbitration, there was no dispute, sufficiently expressed in legal terms, between Claimant and Respondent in relation to the latter's obligation to provide full protection and security in Block 24 due to the opposition of indigenous communities. And while there was a dispute once the Request for Arbitration was filed, this was too late a time for Claimant to comply with the six-month waiting period requirement contained in Article VI with respect to that dispute.\n\n317.\n\nAs a result, Claimant failed to abide by the conditions for acceptance of the offer of ICSID arbitration contained in Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty with respect to its full protection and security claim for Block 24, and this claim is therefore inadmissible.\n\n318.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal upholds Respondent's objection and declares that it lacks jurisdiction over Claimant's Treaty claim for Respondent's alleged failure to provide full protection and security in Block 24 due to the opposition of local indigenous communities.\n\n(ii) Was There a Dispute in Block 23?\n-------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nClaimant assessed that it first requested protection for Block 23 by letter of December 4, 2002 addressed to the Executive President of PetroEcuador. In the letter, CGC, the operator of the Block, wrote:\n\n\"We seek your attention to notify you of the new violent acts that occurred today in Block 23 of the Ecuadorian Amazon region that have hampered the development of the activities of the operator Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Combustibles S.A., CGC. In this regard, we manifest the following:\n\n[Description of events, where it is mentioned that the seismic base was destroyed and eight employees were kidnapped].\n\n\u2026\n\nIn light of these events, *we insist*, in the most self-restrained fashion, that you intercede with your good offices, and take the measures you deem necessary, with the purpose of ensuring that the Armed Forces and the National Police will act resolutely to procure the liberation of the hostages, as well as to facilitate the execution of the ongoing seismic project.....\n\nIt will not go unnoticed by you the constant willingness of my client, the Company CGC, to engage in dialogue and openness in order to achieve agreements and solutions beneficial for the aforementioned communities, moreover, *it is the duty of the Ecuadorian state*, and PetroEcuador in particular, *to guarantee the safety of the operations*, as stated in our contractual agreement and under appropriate constitutional norms\" (Tribunal's translation for the portions where translation was not provided by Claimant) (emphases added) (CM, \u00b6 58, Exh. C-153).\"\n\n320.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the 4 December 2002 letter is sufficient to raise a \"dispute\" within the meaning of Article VI(3) of the Treaty. While the main purpose of the letter is to request assistance from PetroEcuador with the episodes of violence and the opposition met in the Block, the tone and the context of the letter do manifest a disagreement over rights and obligations.\n\n321.\n\nFollowing the description of the facts giving rise to the request for assistance, CGC, the operator of the Block, \"insist[s]\" that the Armed Forces and the National Police act to ensure that the hostages be liberated and that operations in the Block can continue. The very use of the word \"insist\" suggests that the request was previously made without success.\n\n322.\n\nMoreover, towards the end of the letter, Respondent is reminded that it is its \"duty\" to \"guarantee the safety of the operations.\" This reminder, in a context which suggests that previous security requests remained unheard, is indicative of a disagreement concerning rights and obligations.\n\n323.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal must review the significance of Claimant's \"emblematic\" letter for Block 23. This letter is dated 21 December 2005 and is also addressed to the Executive President of PetroEcuador. It states:\n\n\"The Association composed of my client [CGC] and [Burlington] has a PSC with the Ecuadorian State, represented by PetroEcuador, for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 23, located in the Ecuadorian Amazon Region.\n\nPETROECUADOR is aware that [Block 23 is in *force majeure* ].\n\nIn light of the *force majeure* scenario, we have on innumerable occasions requested PETROECUADOR to comply with its obligation, set forth in Clause 5.2.6 of the Contract, to \"***provide reasonable conditions of security to perform operations***\" [...].\n\nDespite the contractor's repeated requests and demands that the State adopt the necessary measures that will enable to perform the activities agreed upon in the contract, which no doubt are oriented to favour the prospects of reserves for the Ecuadorian State, we have not managed to secure PETROECUADOR and the energy authorities' effective intervention in order to overcome the obstacles underlying the *force majeure* situation.\n\nOn the other hand, it is the duty of the Ecuadorian State, through its police power, to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the security of its citizens in the national territory [...].\n\n[CGC has worked]...with each and every one of the communities residing in said Block, for the purpose of being able to perform the activities agreed upon in the contract, without obtaining, regrettably, the indispensable collaboration and commitment of its counterpart, PETROECUADOR and the Ecuadorian State.\n\n... We accompany a binder containing documentary and incontrovertible evidence of [the damages suffered as a result of the insecurity in the Block].\n\nIn this context, it is imperative that PETROECUADOR, on behalf of the Ecuadorian State, comply with its obligation and adopt compensatory measures for the damages caused to my client, while at the same time, with its intervention, the problems that brought about a stoppage of the exploration activities, and qualified as Force Majeure, may be resolved (Tribunal's translation) (emphasis in the original) (Exh. C-176).\"\n\n324.\n\nWith this letter, Claimant unambiguously apprised Respondent of a dispute in relation to its obligation to provide protection and security in Block 23 due to the opposition of the indigenous communities. The letter articulates a clear disagreement with the way Respondent had discharged its security obligations in the Block up to that point. The reference to requests for protection made on \"repeated\" and \"innumerable\" occasions, the emphasis on Ecuador's security obligations, and the demand for compensatory measures plainly indicate the existence of a dispute.\n\n325.\n\nRespondent alleges that there is no dispute in any event because the Block was in *force majeure* and because the Parties collaborated at different points to solve the problems in the Block. In the view of the Tribunal, these are matters for the merits. For purposes of jurisdiction, Claimant has expressed a disagreement over legal rights and obligations with respect to the lack of security in Block 23, and this is all that the term \"dispute\" requires within the meaning of Article VI(3) of the Treaty.\n\n326.\n\nFinally, Respondent states that these letters cannot raise a dispute between Claimant and Respondent because it was CGC, the operator of the Block, who signed the letters. According to Respondent, these letters could at best raise a dispute between CGC and Respondent, not between Claimant and Respondent. The Tribunal disagrees.\n\n327.\n\nDuring the jurisdictional hearing, Mr. Vickers testified that \"it is certainly the industry practice in Ecuador at the behest of the Government that the operator is the representative [of the Block]\" (Tr. 173:20-22). The Tribunal finds confirmation of this \"industry practice\" in the *coactiva* proceedings which prompted Claimant's request for provisional measures in connection with the Law 42 dispute in Blocks 7 and 21 (*see supra at* \u00b6 65).\n\n328.\n\nIn the *coactiva* proceedings, the Executory Tribunal of PetroEcuador initiated proceedings to enforce the payment of US$ 327.3 million due in accordance with Law 42 for oil produced in Blocks 7 and 21. As initially mentioned, Burlington holds significant ownership interests in these two Blocks: 42.5% in Block 7 and 46.25% in Block 21. Revealingly, however, the *coactiva* proceedings were instituted *only* against Perenco, the operator, for the *entire* debt allegedly accrued in Blocks 7 and 21 and not just for Perenco's share of the debt (Exhs. C-55, C-58 and C-65).\n\n329.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, this sufficiently substantiates Mr. Vickers' statement to the effect that, for Block 23, \"CGC was the face before the Government\" (Tr. 178:11-12). Since CGC was the face of Block 23 before the Government, its letters were also sent on behalf of Burlington, which held a 50% interest in the Block through its Burlington Andean subsidiary.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that CGC's letters of 4 December 2002 and 21 December 2005 to PetroEcuador were also sent on behalf of Claimant. The Tribunal is aware that these letters were addressed to PetroEcuador rather than to Ecuador. However, as Ecuador has argued from the outset of this dispute, PetroEcuador was its legal representative for purposes of the PSCs (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12; PetroEcuador's OJ, \u00a7 2.1). It follows that any communications addressed to PetroEcuador in connection with the PSCs must be deemed to have been addressed to Ecuador as well. Thus, CGC's letters of 4 December 2002 and 21 December 2005 properly raised a dispute between Claimant and Respondent within the meaning of Article VI(3) of the Treaty.\n\n331.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that there was a dispute between Claimant and Respondent in connection with the latter's security obligations in Block 23, and that Respondent's objection must thus be rejected. The Tribunal must now focus on Respondent's next objection.\n\n(iii) Was Burlington Under an Obligation to Make Allegations of Treaty Breach?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nRespondent argues that, in any event, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this claim because Claimant failed to provide proper notice of the dispute. According to Respondent, pursuant to Article VI of the Treaty, there is \"proper notice\" of the dispute only when there is an allegation of treaty breach. Claimant asserts that there is no formal notice requirement under Article VI of the Treaty, let alone a requirement that such notice must contain an allegation of treaty breach.\n\n333.\n\nIn its parts relevant to this issue, Article VI provides the following:\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a **dispute** between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or **relating to\u2026(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred** or created **by this Treaty** with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:\n\n[\u2026.]\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that\u2026six months have elapsed **from the date on which the dispute arose**, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding [ICSID] arbitration. (Emphasis added).\n\n334.\n\nArticle VI(1)(c) defines an \"investment dispute\" as one relating to \"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\"14 Article VI(3)(a), in turn, provides that a dispute may be submitted to ICSID arbitration provided that six months have elapsed \"from the date on which the *dispute* arose\" (emphasis added). The Tribunal considers that the meaning of \"dispute\" in Article VI(3)(a) refers back to the definition of \"investment dispute\" in Article VI(1)(c). Indeed, Article VI(1) defines investment dispute \"for purposes of this Article [VI]\", of which paragraph 3 is no doubt a part. The use of the words \"investment dispute\" and then only \"dispute\" in paragraph 2 shows that these two terms designate one and the same thing. The Tribunal agrees on this point with the *Lauder* decision, upon which Respondent relies. That decision reached the same conclusion with respect to a similarly worded dispute resolution clause in the US-Czech BIT15 (see *Lauder*, \u00b6 184).\n\nSince Burlington's full protection and security claims due to the local indigenous opposition in Blocks 23 and 24 raises purely Treaty claims, Article VI(1)(a) and Article VI(1)(b) are inapplicable to this specific dispute.\n\nArticle VI(1) of the US-Czech BIT sets forth as follows: \"For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving\u2026(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\" Article VI(3)(a) in turn provides the following: \"At any time after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration.\" As may be appreciated, both the language and the structure of Article VI of the US-Czech BIT bear a high level of resemblance with Article VI of the US-Ecuador BIT.\n\n335.\n\nIn short, the \"dispute\" to which Article VI(3)(a) refers is one that relates to \"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\" Stated otherwise, as long as no allegation of Treaty breach is made, no dispute will have arisen giving access to arbitration under Article VI. This requirement makes sense as it gives the state an opportunity to remedy a possible Treaty breach and thereby avoid arbitration proceedings under BIT, which would not be possible without knowledge of an allegation of Treaty breach.\n\n336.\n\nBecause a dispute under Article VI(3)(a) only arises once an allegation of Treaty breach is made, the six-month waiting period only begins to run at that point in time. In this case, Burlington made no allegations of Treaty breach in connection with the indigenous opposition in Blocks 23 and 24 prior to filing its Request for Arbitration. As a result, the waiting period of Article VI(3)(a) did not begin to run. And while Burlington did make allegations of Treaty breach once it filed its Request for Arbitration, at which point the dispute arose, it failed to comply with the six-month waiting period, as it should have, before filing the Request. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Burlington's claim for Block 23 is also inadmissible.\n\n337.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Article VI does not impose a formal notice requirement, it considers that Article VI requires evidence of some form or another that allegations of Treaty breach have been made. By way of example, meeting minutes containing evidence that such allegations were made could suffice. However, Claimant has presented no such evidence.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the requirement that allegations of Treaty breach must be made would not hinder the negotiation process, as Claimant's reliance upon *Generation Ukraine* suggests. Article VI does not require the investor to spell out its legal case in detail during the initial negotiation process; Article VI does not even require the investor to invoke specific Treaty provisions at that stage. Rather, Article VI simply requires the investor to inform the host State that it faces allegations of Treaty breach which could eventually engage the host State's international responsibility before an international tribunal. In other words, it requires the investor to apprize the host State of the likely consequences that would follow should the negotiation process break down.\n\n339.\n\nFinally, Claimant contends that Respondent did not set in motion any government machinery with respect to the allegations of Treaty breach Claimant did make in connection with the Law 42 dispute. In the view of the Tribunal, however, this cannot dispense Claimant from complying with the Treaty requirements with respect to a different dispute.\n\n340.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that Burlington's full protection and security claim for Block 23 is inadmissible in accordance with Article VI of the Treaty. It adds that in ICSID arbitration the inadmissibility of claims has the same consequence as the failure to meet the requirements for jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or the BIT, such consequence being that the Tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n**2.3.2. Has Burlington Perfected Consent to Arbitrate?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's conclusions that Burlington's full protection and security claims for lack of physical security in Blocks 23 and 24 are inadmissible, it is unnecessary to address Ecuador's remaining objection, namely, that it withdrew its offer of ICSID arbitration pursuant to an Article 25(4) ICSID Convention declaration before Burlington actually accepted this offer.\n\n**V. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal declares that:\n\nA. It has jurisdiction over the following claim: Burlington's expropriation claim under Article III of the Treaty;\n\nB. It joins to the merits the determination of whether it has jurisdiction over Burlington's Law 42 first umbrella clause claim and over the first limb of its third umbrella clause claim under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty;\n\nC. Burlington's Law 42 second umbrella clause claim and the second limb of its third umbrella clause claim under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty lapsed on their own terms;\n\nD. It lacks jurisdiction over the following claims:\n\n1. Burlington's Law 42 fair and equitable treatment claim under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty;\n\n2. Burlington's Law 42 arbitrary impairment claim under Article II(3)(b) of the Treaty;\n\n3. Burlington's Law 42 full protection and security claim under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty;\n\nE. The following claims are inadmissible pursuant to Article VI(3) of the Treaty:\n\n1. Burlington's full protection and security claim for Block 24 under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty;\n\n2. Burlington's full protection and security claim for Block 23 under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.\n\nF. In accordance with Rule 41(4) of the Rules, it will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings toward the merits phase;\n\nG. It reserves the decision on costs for subsequent adjudication."}, {"Title": "Decision on Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (Decision on Liability)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2012-11-08T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (Decision on Liability)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI very much regret not to be in full agreement with my distinguished colleagues in the Tribunal. I share many of the conclusions of the Decision, particularly the final one concerning that there has been an act of expropriation in this case in the light of the taking of possession of the Blocks by the Respondent's officials that, as the Tribunal rightly concludes, dispossessed the Claimant not only of its oil production share, and hence of its revenues, but also of the means of production that made those revenues possible, thereby being totally deprived of the effective use and control of the investment.\n\n2.\n\nIt is my respectful submission, however, that the Decision stops short of recognizing a number of other rights that the investor has in the context of the PSCs, the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework and, most significantly, the Treaty and international law. This narrower approach the Decision follows results in that a number of acts that would normally qualify as contract or Treaty breaches, and thus entail liability, are dispensed of a legal sanction and of its consequence in the light of the State's international responsibility for wrongful acts.\n\n3.\n\nThe first shortcoming with which I disagree concerns the meaning and extent of the umbrella clause as written in Article II (3) (c) of the Treaty. It is a well known fact that this matter has given place to a prolonged debate in investment arbitration and international law. The CMS Award, with which I was involved as the presiding arbitrator, took one position. The CMS Annulment Committee, for whose members I have the greatest respect, took a different approach. A number of awards have followed one or other line of thought. The essential divide between these lines of jurisprudence is that concerning privity.\n\n4.\n\nThe Decision has decided to follow to the letter the decision of the CMS Annulment Committee on this last question. While the Decision notes that it is debatable whether the *Azurix*, *Siemens* and *CMS* Annulment decisions constitute a series of consistent cases in respect of the alleged privity requirement, it nonetheless concludes that there is a majority of cases supporting such requirement and assigns particular authority to the *CMS* Annulment decision. I have supported the view that tribunals ought to take into consideration prior decisions on relevant matters in spite of not amounting to legal precedents that ought to be followed, but in this particular matter I do not believe there is such consistency that would compel the Decision to decide as it has. No doubt the *CMS* Annulment is a very respectable opinion, but it is just one opinion among other and the fact of it being the outcome of annulment proceedings does not make it more authoritative, as *Continental Casualty* and other cases evidence. Even some cases such as *Siemens* and *Azurix* that are often invoked as supporting the requirement of privity are not quite conclusive on this issue as the Decision notes, certainly not as a matter of principle as distinguished from the circumstances of the cases respectively considered. Jurisprudence is not formed by majority counting and even then the counting on this matter does not seem to add up in support of the Decision's conclusion.\n\n5.\n\nThe main question discussed by the Decision in this context is the affirmation by the *CMS* Annulment decision that obligations are entered into with regard to particular persons, who are the obligor and the obligee of rights and obligations under a contract. In this case, it is concluded, that legal relationship exists only between the Respondent and the Claimant's subsidiaries, but not the parent company that is claiming under the Treaty, including its claim for breach of the umbrella clause. From the point of view of Civil law, including the Ecuadorean Civil Code, just as from the point of view of contract law, there can be no disagreement with this premise. The issue here, however, is different as it entails determining whose rights are protected under the Treaty and who are the obligor and obligee in the context of complex business transactions usually characterizing investments.\n\n6.\n\nThe issue is not entirely new in the light of the extensive jurisprudence of commercial arbitration tribunals, most notably those operating under the International Chamber of Commerce arbitration rules, to extend the reach of the arbitration clause to third parties when there is a link between that party and the signatory of the contract. That link relates not only to obligations of the third party that are called into account but also relates to the rights that it is entitled to enforce. This very trend is also present in important domestic legislation and jurisprudence, to wit the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 in England which abolished the doctrine of privity of contract and allows a benefit to be conferred upon a non-contracting party.\n\n7.\n\nIn this case Article 1 of the Treaty expressly protects both direct and indirect investments. The obligations to which the umbrella clause refers are also those relating to investments. It would not really matter whether the protected investment is a minority one, as in *CMS*, or the ownership reaches 100%, as here. What matters is that the Treaty has intended to protect all qualifying direct or indirect investments. The latter make take many different forms.\n\n8.\n\nI regret not to be able to agree with the Decision's conclusion that while some Treaty provisions protect both direct and indirect investments, such as expropriation, on other matters, such as the umbrella clause, the scope of the protection is different and does not apply to indirect investments lacking the privity requirement. The Treaty does not make that distinction and if this had been the intention it would have had to be spelled out. A tribunal is not empowered to write into the treaty what the parties have not agreed to. Moreover, in my submission such interpretation is at odds with the rule governing interpretation of treaties under Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, particularly in so far the role of the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose is concerned.\n\n9.\n\nIt is the submission of this arbitrator that the right conclusion should have been that the entity whose interest in the investment is protected under the treaty is also entitled to benefit from the protection of an umbrella clause devised to ensure the observance of obligations concerning that investment. This is often the case when the contract is signed by an investment vehicle or by a local company channeling the investment. When the use of such vehicles or local companies is required by the host State by means of legislation or regulation such conclusion becomes imperative.\n\n10.\n\nAn interpretation to the effect that only the corporate entity having signed the contract can rely on the protection of the umbrella clause will inevitably lead to a negation of the protection in question depriving the treaty of all meaning in this context. Such a view entails extending the treaty protection to its beneficiaries, including the umbrella clause, with the one hand, and then denying such protection with the other hand. In spite that it is sometimes thought that such an interpretation is helpful to restrict the liability of the host country, in fact it might well have the opposite effect as it will put an end to many kinds of joint-ventures and other forms of investment that are channeled through investment vehicles to the benefit of the host State. To begin with no investment would be channeled through a local company which is by definition prevented from claiming against its own State of nationality.\n\n11.\n\nThe essential test continues to be the determination of whose is the real interest in the investment, as it was well explained by the *Goetz* tribunal: \"le Tribunal observe que la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure du CIRDI ne limite pas la qualit\u00e9 pour agir aux seules personnes morales directement vis\u00e9es par les mesures litigieuses mais l'\u00e9tend aux actionnaires de ces personnes, qui sont les v\u00e9ritables investisseurs\". A number of contemporary decisions have recognized such interests, a view that I believe to be consistent with both the applicable treaty and international law. Exceptions are of course justified, as when corporate personality is abused as a mere jurisdictional device to obtain an otherwise unavailable access to international arbitration. No such abuse is present in this case nor has it been alleged to be.\n\n12.\n\nThe conclusions of the Decision concerning the unavailability of the umbrella clause as far as contract claims are concerned touches upon a number of other questions of importance. The Claimant has noted in this respect that it is paradoxical that while the application of the umbrella clause is denied as to the protection of its rights under the PSCs, its contract obligations are nevertheless relied upon for the purpose of the counterclaim made in this case. The Decision rightly concludes that such counterclaim is based on a specific agreement between the parties as to the question of jurisdiction, but such an agreement does not cover of course the questions relating to the merits that will inevitably be centered upon the provisions of the PSCs.\n\n13.\n\nAnother implication of the Decision's conclusions on this matter devolves on the much debated subject of the relations between contract claims and treaty claims. It is today well accepted that not every breach of contract amounts to a treaty breach, just as it is also accepted that certain contract breaches can be the source of treaty claims. To the extent that no contract rights are recognized in the light of the privity question, there would be no treaty rights arising from that source at all. The issue, however, does not seem to be as simple as that and additional complexities may be noted.\n\n14.\n\nThe Decision has rightly concluded that the waiver of claims with prejudice by Claimant's subsidiaries does not mean that they have waived the underlying rights and these may be relied upon by the Claimant to pursue its Treaty claims. Most certainly such waiver has not been made by the Claimant. It thus follows that in spite of the finding that the lack of privity impedes the Claimant to claim contract rights under the PSCs, there are still underlying rights that may be claimed for as Treaty claims.\n\n15.\n\nThis leads to yet another complexity relating to the umbrella clause that the parties have discussed and the Decision has decided upon: the link of that clause to the breach, not of contract but of legislation. It is also well known that different interpretations have been made in respect of this matter by decisions of investment tribunals, some believing that the umbrella clause can only apply to contract obligations and other affirming that, in addition, it can apply to commitments made by law or regulation. This arbitrator is of the view that while normally such legislative extent might be difficult to establish, either because of the general scope of legislation or because the obligations might not be specific enough, it can also understand that in some cases, such as this one, it is justified.\n\n16.\n\nThe Decision has concluded that under Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Legal Framework there are in fact obligations concerning the right to a share of production in the contract area, just as there is a right to tax adjustment when contracts are modified, but further concluding that since these rights assume the existence of a contract once they are included in the PSCs the purpose of the legal provisions is exhausted and they cannot any longer serve as an obligation to be protected under the umbrella clause separately from the PSCs. I regret not to share this last conclusion.\n\n17.\n\nThe obligations contained in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework are specific enough to every investment taking advantage of its provisions to enter into a PSC. The scope of the Legal Framework is also very specific to this sector. It is thus this arbitrator's submission that if the contractual enforcement of the right fails to be kept with, the rights under the Legal Framework survive untouched and they can serve as the very basis of an umbrella clause claim under the Treaty, separately from the contract and therefore do not become necessarily exhausted. In the instant case the rights were included in the PSCs but not observed when the time came and, moreover, the PSCs were terminated by the Caducidad process by Respondent's unilateral decision. The rights will hence be available for umbrella clause protection in spite that the contract rights might not be recognized as available to the Claimant.\n\n18.\n\nThe second major question motivating this dissent concerns the manner how an increase of the State's share of production of natural resources and income can be achieved. One can fully understand and respect the State's policy objective to share the benefits resulting from windfall profits, as it is evident in all corners of the world. A 50% share is probably the expression of the equitable participation on a fifty-fifty split basis, but the Tribunal is bound to decide the controversy submitted to it not under equity but under the governing law as written in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework, the PSCs, the Treaty and international law. Under the rule of law, particularly in the light of specific commitments and the inclusion of tax stabilization clauses, there are only three avenues open to attend to such objectives.\n\n19.\n\nThe first avenue is by means of negotiations which in the instant case did not succeed. The second is to attempt judicial recognition of the modification of a contract in the light of the doctrine of *rebus sic stantibus*. The doctrine is also referred to in the record although the Respondent alleged not to have relied on it in justification of the measures adopted. The Decision concludes in this respect that the Respondent has not invoked such doctrine and that there is no need to examine its requirements. This arbitrator must note, however, that arguments as to the unforeseeable character of the oil price increase, which are of the essence of that doctrine, have been made. It would have been preferable for the Decision to examine this doctrine in the light of the strict requirements for its application under international law.\n\n20.\n\nThe third avenue is to alter production sharing and income distribution by means of expropriation subject to prompt, adequate and effective compensation that is not available in this case either. In this context I must respectfully disagree with the manner how the Decision has dealt with expropriation.\n\n21.\n\nWhile as noted above I fully agree with the conclusion of the Decision that there has been expropriation and that the acts in question are unlawful, I submit that the Decision has narrowed these findings down to the question of taking of possession of the Blocks. The issues surrounding the effects of Law No. 42, the Coactiva process and the ultimate measure of Caducidad of the PSCs also justify in this arbitrator's views a finding of expropriation.\n\n22.\n\nI have no disagreement with the findings of the Decision as to the fact that the record evidences that the economy of the PSCs was not linked to a certain price per barrel of oil or to an internal rate of return of 15% each. As rightly concluded it was only linked to the economic value of its oil participation share. Moreover, I concur with the Decision's findings as to the fact that the tax absorption clauses are equivalent to tax stabilization clauses.\n\n23.\n\nWhile agreeing with the premise that States have an inherent authority to tax and that such power finds its limits in the requirements of customary international law as to nondiscrimination and of not amounting to confiscation, I disagree with the Decision's conclusion that the effects of Law 42 at either a 50% or a 99% participation in the increase of revenues above a certain minimum threshold do not result in expropriation of the investment. In fact, after having the Decision concluded that by introducing a price factor to allocate oil revenues, Law 42 modified the parties' choice to exclude such a factor and hence resulted in oil revenues being redirected to the State in the form of taxes, with the added result that the refusal to apply a correction factor so as to absorb the effects of the taxation approved specifically breached the PSCs, the Decision goes on to conclude that neither the 50% nor the 99% increase in participation amount to substantial deprivation of the value of the investment.\n\n24.\n\nThis arbitrator shares the view that substantial deprivation is an appropriate standard to determine expropriation under international law, albeit not the only one, but even then the facts of this case prove that substantial deprivation did indeed occur. The reasoning of the Decision on this matter is that because taxes amounted beforehand to a level of 40%, including therein income tax and employment contribution, the increase to 50% would only mean, after complex calculations, that the investor's take of the total oil revenues was reduced by 29.2% for Block 7 and 32.8% reduction for Block 21. Applying the same exercise to the increase to 99% it is concluded that the reduction for Block 7 would amount to 58% and for Block 21 to 70.2%.\n\n25.\n\nWhile considering that these last figures considerably diminished Burlington's profits the Decision concludes that they do not prove that the investment became unprofitable or worthless. I respectfully dissent from this finding as no reasonable businessman would be likely to conclude that after having to turn over to the State 50% or, worse, 99% of its revenue income such venture would be profitable or valuable. Indeed it would be almost impossible to find a willing buyer in such circumstances because of the adverse effects of the measures adopted on the viability of the business.\n\n26.\n\nIn this arbitrator's submission there can be many exercises at calculating how profits are affected or unaffected. In this case this arbitrator is not comfortable with the calculation exercise undertaken by the Decision, with the added difficulty that the amortization of capital investments has not been considered in spite that it has carefully complied with the requirements of the law. The concept of substantial deprivation is not, however, a mathematical exercise but a question of reasonableness. The increases under Law 42 are, particularly at the 99% level, beyond any standard of reasonableness, as has been stated by the very Respondent government when deciding to roll back the top figure to 70% in certain circumstances.\n\n27.\n\nWhat matters in the end is not to judge what taxes were before the increase, but which is the overall impact of the measures taken. It does not matter either whether the measures are called a tax, a royalty or a levy in spite of lengthy arguments of the parties in this context. The essential determination is which share of the income will be taken by the State one way or the other. A 50% tax level on income, while not unheard of, is very substantial. A 99% tax level is simply not just an expropriation but a confiscation, even if in this case the investor was allowed to keep a certain minimum income arising from the economy of the PSCs as interpreted by the Respondent. In the end it means that the individual or entity affected will work one half of its time, or close to a 100% of its time, for the State while being allowed that minimum income. I cannot consider any such effect reasonable. Moreover, I believe it raises a serious issue concerning the freedom of the individual in a democratic society. Substantial deprivation is therefore very much the effect of such measures.\n\n28.\n\nThere are in this arbitrator's view two other shortcomings affecting the finding of expropriation. One concerns ***the Coactiva*** measures directed to enforce the tax dues by means of which oil was seized and later auctioned at below market prices. The Decision concludes than since these measures only affected oil and not the entire investment there could be no direct expropriation under the Treaty. The Decision further concludes that the effects of Coactiva measures are not different from those of Law 42 at 99%, and because the latter were found not to amount to expropriation their enforcement neither could then have that effect.\n\n29.\n\nThis arbitrator respectfully disagrees with that conclusion. First direct expropriation need not affect the entirety of the investment to be in breach of Treaty rights. More importantly, however, is the fact that revenues were affected as a result of enforcement measures of Coactiva, certainly during the period of enforcement and in the end permanently as a result of related measures of taking of possession and Caducidad. The view that at the end of collection the investor would have resumed its earnings capacity proved to be quite theoretical, among other reasons because the value of property will have been seriously affected as a consequence of the process as a whole, including in particular the possibility of disposing of the assets concerned.\n\n30.\n\nMoreover, such measures were adopted in disregard of the provisional remedies ordered by the Tribunal, a situation that renders Coactiva quite at odds with the orderly conduct of arbitration proceedings and the authority of the Tribunal. I respectfully suggest that such an event should not pass without consequences.\n\n31.\n\nAnother shortcoming of the Decision's findings concerns Caducidad. While the Decision rightly concludes that the taking of possession of the blocks constitute an act of unlawful expropriation because of the reasons therein explained, it does not believe it necessary to discuss the termination of the PSCs by means of Caducidad in view that expropriation had already occurred with the taking of possession and hence Caducidad came only to formalize a prevailing state of affairs. This arbitrator believes that termination of contracts in the circumstances is an aggravating factor of the unlawfulness of expropriation because all rights are then dispensed with, not just the means of production. The investor ends up empty handed and the many millions that have been invested simply vanish with all accompanying rights and guarantees.\n\n32.\n\nThe process of expropriation as a whole is interlinked in its various components. Beginning with Law 42, followed by Coactiva, culminating in the taking of possession and ending up in Caducidad are all elements that cannot be disaggregated. Characterizing as expropriation only the taking of possession isolates those other elements and narrows down the effects of expropriation. While some measures in themselves might not be enough in the Decision's view to amount to direct expropriation, if one looks at the process as a whole the interlinking noted leads from one step to the other. In this arbitrator's view this is thus a case where, in spite that expropriation is not admitted in respect of the various components, a phase of creeping expropriation leads finally to a situation of direct expropriation. The two kinds of expropriation are not incompatible and it is necessary to approach the effects of expropriation from beginning to end, not just at the end. Among other consequences of one or the other choice there is the question that the date of expropriation as to establishing compensation will be earlier or later.\n\n33.\n\nThis arbitrator believes that this is where the Fair and Equitable Treatment provided for under Article II. 3 of the Treaty, specifically relied upon by the provisions on expropriation of Article III of the same Treaty, has an important role to play. Even if the measures preceding formal direct expropriation are not considered as amounting to expropriation, a conclusion that as noted this arbitrator does not share, they do not seem to be in compliance with the meaning of Fair and Equitable Treatment. Because of the link between the provisions noted expropriation cannot ignore the fact that measures that were conducive to it might be in breach on the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard, thus compounding liability.\n\n34.\n\nIt is submitted that this is not a case of a stand-alone standard that might be irreconcilable with the findings of the Decision on Jurisdiction, which is in itself open to doubt on this point, but of standards that apply consecutively so as to take into consideration the aggregate of measures intervening in this case and ultimately resulting in the expropriation noted. Not even the fact that Article X of the Treaty restricts jurisdiction in taxation matters to, among other cases, expropriation, would prevent this conclusion since that very Article remits to expropriation under Article III which in turns provides the link to Fair and Equitable Treatment. It is thus the very Treaty that has foreseen an inter-linkage of measures that might be conducive to expropriation.\n\n35.\n\nWith all due respect one is left with the impression that these shortcomings convey the wrong message beyond the case in point. It would appear that an investor, or for that matter any individual, might be squeezed by means of taxation or other measures until its income is largely or entirely diverted to the State. It would also appear that its remaining assets could be attached and auctioned so as to collect the taxes due. Finally, there would be termination of all its rights. None of such measures would entail liability. But do not send in the police or the army to take possession, this being the only measure resulting in unlawful expropriation. Because of the above reasons I respectfully believe differently."}], "Content": "Decision on Liability\n---------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Bilateral Investment Treaty; specifically \"Treaty between the United States and Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments\" of 11 May 1997 |\n| CPHB | Burlington's Post-Hearing Brief of 6 May 2011 |\n| CSM | Burlington's Supplemental Memorial on Liability of 29 September 2010 |\n| COSS | Claimant [Burlington]'s Opening Statement Slides for the liability hearing |\n| DJ | Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 June 2010 |\n| ER | Expert Report |\n| Exh.

ECUADOR'S OIL INDUSTRY: THE PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT MODEL**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis Section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to rule on Respondent's purported liability under the Treaty between the United States and Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment\" (the \"Treaty\" or \"BIT\").\n\n6.\n\nThis dispute arose in the wake of the oil price spike that began in 2002 and that, though with some intermittence, continues to this date. The Parties are in dispute as to how the economic benefits of this oil price spike must be distributed between them. At the heart of this dispute lie the production sharing contracts (\"PSCs\") for Blocks 7 and 21, entered into between a Burlington wholly-owned subsidiary and Ecuador. Before entering into the specifics of the dispute, a review of the recent history of Ecuador's hydrocarbons industry is warranted to place the dispute in proper context.\n\n7.\n\nAlong its history, Ecuador has adopted different contract models for the exploration and exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources. In the 1980s, the prevalent contract model for the exploitation of hydrocarbons in Ecuador was the so-called service contract. Under the service contract model, the government remained the sole owner of any oil produced in the exploration area (the \"Block\") awarded to the private contractor. If the contractor discovered oil reserves, it had the right to a reimbursement of its costs and to a fee. If it found no oil reserves within a four-year period, the contractor lost its exploration investment and the contract was terminated.1\n\nMem., \u00b6 41 n. 42.\n\n8.\n\nThe service contract model appeared ill-suited to meet the interests of the State or the investors alike. The State often incurred losses on oil-producing blocks operated under service contract models, in part because the contractor's costs frequently spiraled out of control and the State was contractually bound to reimburse the full measure of these costs.2 The model was thus unfit to curb cost inefficiencies.3 On the other hand, investors showed little interest in the service contract model, in part because the profit margins under this model, albeit steady, were fixed. Investors seemingly preferred to shoulder part of the exploration and exploitation risk in exchange for a share of the oil produced. Tellingly, no service contract was executed in the five-year period between 1989-1993. In a nutshell, with the service contract model, Ecuador's hydrocarbons industry remained stagnant.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 50, 62.\n\nTr. 590:15-591:10.\n\n9.\n\nBeginning in 1992, the newly-elected Ecuadorian President Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n set out to impart new vigor to the sluggish national oil industry. To bring that goal to fruition, the legal regime applicable to hydrocarbons was overhauled. In October 1993, in the context of a general program of economic reforms designed to increase the role of the private sector, President Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n submitted a bill to Congress calling for the adoption of a new contract model for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons: the so-called production-sharing contract (or \"PSC\"). Under this contract model, the contractor would assume the entire risk of oil exploration and exploitation, and would in exchange receive a share of the oil produced in accordance with the allocation formulas specified in each contract.\n\n10.\n\nThe new PSC model was expected to redress the problems that emerged under the service contract model. It would shift the exploration and exploitation risks from the State to the contractor and would thus put an end to the problem of excessive and inefficient costs incurred at the State's expense. In the letter to the Ecuadorian National Congress (the \"Ecuadorian Congress\") enclosing the bill, President Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n observed that:\n\n\"[T]he limited financial resources that the country has [\u2026] do not justify PetroEcuador's assumption of all the risk involved in exploration activities; such risk must be shared with international petroleum companies. [\u2026] [T]he stipulation for mandatory reimbursement of the contractor's investments, costs and expenditures has significantly reduced the participation of the State in the economic benefits of oil exploration and production in medium and small fields.\"4\n\nExh. C-78, pp. 2-4 (Claimant's translation); Mem., \u00b6 63.\n\n11.\n\nIn addition, the new PSC would help to attract foreign investment. In the letter to the Ecuadorian Congress, President Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n noted that \"the current [service contract model] has exhausted its possibilities of attracting foreign capital.\"5 One of the reasons why the service contract model failed to attract foreign investment was that it did not allow contractors to receive a share of the oil production. In the words of President Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n:\n\n\"[T]he service contract does not permit the contracting company to have a production flow of its own. This characteristic goes against the interest and *raison d'\u00eatre* of international petroleum companies, for the majority of whom the availability of production is an essential aspect of marketing in international markets. [\u2026] The new contract [\u2026] will allow Ecuador to position itself at an internationally competitive level for attracting venture capital [\u2026].\"6\n\nExh.

C-78, at p. 4 (Claimant's translation); Mem., \u00b6 64.\n\n12.\n\nThe overall purpose of the proposed shift from service contracts to PSCs was, in sum, to increase Ecuador's competitiveness in the global oil industry. On 29 November 1993, the Ecuadorian Congress approved the bill authorizing the State to enter into PSCs with private companies. In passing this amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law, the Ecuadorian Congress underlined that it was \"indispensable to introduce in the Ecuadorian legislature contractual models that make the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons competitive.\"7 In conjunction with this amendment, Ecuador issued Decree 1417 which regulated in detail various aspects of the Hydrocarbons Law (collectively, the Law and the Decree will be referred to in this award as the \"Hydrocarbons Legal Framework\").\n\nExh. C-15, Preamble (Tribunal's translation).\n\n13.\n\nSubsequently, Ecuador opened international bidding rounds aimed at concluding PSCs with private companies. The purpose of this bidding process was to \"promote foreign investment in the Country and expand the hydrocarbons reserves.\"8 On 20 March 1995, Ecuador awarded the production sharing contract for the exploration and exploitation of Block 21 to foreign investors.9 Furthermore, on 23 March 2000, Ecuador converted the existing service contract for the exploration and exploitation of Block 7 into a production sharing contract..10\n\nExh.

BURLINGTON'S INTERESTS IN THE PSCS FOR BLOCKS 7 AND 21**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nBeginning in mid-2001, Burlington acquired interests in the PSCs executed by the Ecuadorian State for the exploration and exploitation of Blocks 7 and 21. Burlington acquired these interests through its wholly-owned subsidiary Burlington Oriente (or the \"Burlington subsidiary\"). Burlington also acquired interests in the PSCs for Blocks 23 and 24. While Burlington originally asserted claims against Ecuador in relation to Blocks 23 and 24, which were not yet in production, the Parties have since settled these claims. Therefore, this decision is confined to Burlington's outstanding claims in relation to Blocks 7 and 21, which were in production at the time this dispute arose.\n\n15.\n\nBurlington is the minority partner of Blocks 7 and 21. The Blocks are located in the Ecuadorian Amazon Region, and each covers an area of 200,000 hectares. Burlington holds a 42.5% interest in the PSC for Block 711, and a 46.25% interest in the PSC for Block 21.12 The majority partner and operator of the Blocks, the French oil company Perenco, holds the remaining interests in the Blocks. Under an Ecuadorian tax regulation issued on 23 September 2005, partners in PSCs for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons must form a consortium for the joint payment of taxes. In accordance with this regulation, Burlington Oriente and Perenco established a consortium in late 2005, which became effective on 1 January 2006 (the \"Tax Consortium\" or simply the \"Consortium\").\n\nWith respect to Block 7, Burlington Oriente acquired a 25% interest on 25 September 2001, a 5% interest on 13 December 2001, and a 12.5% interest in September 2006. Each of these transactions was followed by the requisite government approvals and registrations.\n\nWith respect to Block 21, Burlington Oriente acquired a 32.5% interest in September 2001, a 5% interest on 7 December 2011, and a 8.75% interest on 7 September 2005. Each of these transactions was followed by the requisite government approvals and registrations.\n\n16.\n\nThe PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 regulated at length the parties' rights and obligations in relation to the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in the Blocks. The PSC for Block 7 was set to expire in 2010; the PSC for Block 21 in 2021. In particular, the PSCs (i) contained participation formulas allocating the oil produced between the State and the contractors, (ii) included choice of law provisions in favor of Ecuadorian law and, (iii) of pivotal importance to this case, incorporated certain tax clauses whose meaning is considerably disputed by the Parties.\n\n17.\n\nFirst, the PSCs contained participation formulas allocating the oil produced between Ecuador, on the one hand, and the contractors (Burlington and Perenco), on the other. The PSCs allocated oil production on the basis of the volumes of oil produced, with a possible upward or downward adjustment based on the quality of the oil.13 The Parties vigorously disagree over whether these participation formulas were also linked to the price of oil at the time the PSCs were concluded. Burlington submits that the participation formulas were grounded solely on the volume and quality of oil produced. Ecuador, on the other hand, claims that the participation formulas were also premised on the price of oil at the time of the PSCs, which would yield a specific internal rate of return (\"IRR\") for the contractor.\n\nExhs. C-1 and C-2, at clause 8.1.\n\n18.\n\nThe PSC for Block 7 established the following participation formula:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Block 7**14 |\n| **Daily average production per year (barrels)** | **Contractor's** **Participation** |\n|  | < 5,000 | 76.2% |\n|  | 5,000 \u2013 10,000 | 74.2% |\n|  | > 10,000 | 65% |\n|  |\n\nExh. C-1, at clause 8.1; Mem., \u00b6 103.\n\n19.\n\nThe PSC for Block 21 stipulated the following participation formula:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Block 2115** |\n|  | **Daily average production per year (barrels)** | **Contractor's** **Participation** |\n|  | < 30,000 | 67.5% |\n|  | 30,000 \u2013 60,000 | 60% |\n|  | > 60,000 | 60% |\n\nExh. C-2, at clause 8.1; Mem., \u00b6 103.\n\n20.\n\nSecond, the PSCs included choice of law provisions in favor of Ecuadorian law. The Parties are in dispute as to whether or not these provisions are legal stabilization clauses, *i.e.* clauses whereby the contract is governed by the laws in force at the time of its execution, as opposed to laws as subsequently modified. Clause 22.1 of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 provide that:\n\n\"Applicable Legislation: This Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and *laws in force at the time of its signature are understood to be incorporated by reference*.\"16 (emphasis added)\n\nExhs. C-1 and C-2 at clause 22.1.\n\n21.\n\nThird, the PSCs incorporated tax clauses regulating the tax treatment that would be afforded to the contractor. Thus, the PSCs stipulated an employment contribution of 15%, an income tax of 25%17, and exempted the contractor from the payment of royalties or other additional fees. Moreover, the PSCs contained tax modification clauses, that is, clauses calling for the application of a \"correction factor\" whenever tax changes \u2013 be it tax increases or decreases \u2013 had an impact on the economy of the contract. The Parties strongly disagree about the import of these clauses: for Burlington, these are tax stabilization clauses; for Ecuador, these are merely renegotiation clauses. Until it has reached a conclusion about their nature, the Tribunal will refer to these clauses as the \"tax modification clauses\", for it is undisputed that they regulate the parties' conduct in the event of a modification to the tax system. The tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 7 provides:\n\n\"Modification to the tax system: In the event of a modification to the tax system or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract or of the employment contribution, in force at the time of the execution of this Contract and as set out in this Clause, which have an impact on the economy of this Contract, a correction factor will be included in the production sharing percentages to absorb the impact of the increase or decrease in the tax or in the employment contribution burden. This correction factor will be calculated between the Parties and will be subject to the procedure set forth in Article thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for Application of the Law Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law.\"18\n\nThe combined tax burden of the employment contribution (15%) and the income tax (25%) is 36.25% and not 40% (Exh. C-1, at 11.2.4; Exh. C-2, at 11.2.2). This is because the employment contribution applies to the gross profits, but the income tax applies only to the lower amount that results following the application of the employment contribution.\n\nExh. C-1, clause 11.12 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n22.\n\nFor its part, the tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21 states:\n\n\"Modification to the tax system and to the employment contribution: In the event of a modification to the tax system, the employment contribution or its interpretation, which have an impact on the economics of this Contract, a correction factor will be included in the production sharing percentages to absorb the increase or decrease in the tax. This adjustment will be approved by the Administrative Board on the basis of a study that the Contractor will present to that effect.\"19\n\nExh. C-2, clause 11.7 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n**D. ORIGIN OF THE DISPUTE: OIL PRICE INCREASES AND ECUADOR'S RESPONSE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nAs noted above, Burlington initially acquired interests in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 in September 2001.20 The crude oil produced in Block 7 is called Oriente crude and it is a high-quality crude, with a gravity ranging between 26\u00b0-29\u00b0 API21; the crude oil produced in Block 21 is known as Napo crude and is of somewhat lower quality, with a gravity oscillating between 17\u00b0-19\u00b0 API. Thus, the market price of Oriente crude is higher than the market price of Napo crude. In September 2001, when Burlington acquired its initial interests in the PSCs for the Blocks, the price of Oriente crude was USD 20.15 per barrel.22 Block 21 was not in production at that time, and would not be in production until late 2003.23\n\nSee *supra*, notes 11 and 12.\n\nAPI is a scale developed by the American Petroleum Institute (API): the higher the API, \"the lighter \u2013 and hence, more valuable \u2013 the crude becomes\" (Mem., \u00b6 42 n.44.)\n\nMartinez Direct Examination binder, Oil Prices tab (hereinafter \"Martinez, Oil Prices tab\").\n\n*Id*.; also, Mem., \u00b6 161 (\"Production in Block 21 began in 2003\").\n\n24.\n\nBeginning in 2002, oil prices began to rise. In 2005, the price of a barrel of oil had more than doubled, exceeding USD 50/bbl for Oriente crude between August and October 2005. By 2006, the price of Oriente crude reached over USD 60/bbl, and Napo crude went over USD 50/bbl. Towards the end of 2007, Oriente crude was trading at around USD 80/bbl and Napo crude at around USD 74/bbl. By 2008, the price of oil surpassed the USD 100/bbl landmark for both Oriente and Napo crude from May to July, reaching USD 121.66/bbl for Oriente crude in June 200824 \u2013 that is, more than USD 100/bbl above its September 2001 price. Thereafter, oil prices fell sharply to below USD 30/bbl at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, only to increase again and stabilize in the range of USD 60-70/bbl for most of 2009 and 2010.25\n\nNapo crude reached a peak of USD 114.67/bbl in June 2008.\n\nSee *supra* note 22.\n\n25.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the increase in oil prices was foreseeable or not. Burlington argues that the parties foresaw the possibility that oil prices would increase. Moreover, as illustrated in the graph below26, in the late 1970s oil prices had experienced the same type of increase as in 2008.\n\nEcuador has noted that the graph fails to specify what kind of oil it refers to: \"[T]here are different kinds of crude oils with different prices. The Ecuadorian crude oil has one price, the WTI has another, the Brent crude oil has another price.\" (Tr. 619:11-19; also RPHB, \u00b6 39). WTI stands for West Texan Intermediate. (Martinez, Oil Prices tab). The WTI is an international benchmark for oil prices. Ecuadorian crude oil prices are lower than WTI prices (RCM, \u00b6 176 n.113) but nonetheless \"follow the evolution of WTI\" (D\u00e1valos, Tr. 620:5-10). Counsel for Burlington assumed that the graph referred to WTI prices (Tr. 620:11-17).\n\n26.\n\nEcuador, on the other hand, maintains that the increase in oil prices was \"completely unforeseen and unforeseeable.\"27 Oil prices remained stable from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 2000s. Ecuador claims that the oil price increases of the 1970s were brought about by specific events, to wit, \"the Arab world's tightening of oil production\"28 following the Yom Kippur War, and the Iranian revolution together with the Iran-Iraq war.29 The graph below illustrates how oil price forecasts evolved from 2002 to 2005.30\n\nRCM, \u00b6 179.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 178.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 176-181.\n\nExpert Report of Fair Links, January 2011 (hereinafter \"Fair Links ER\"), \u00b6 65, Figure 6; RPHB, \u00b6 59.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, this price increase \"destroyed the economic stability\" of the PSCs, including the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.31 More generally, Ecuador believed that the allocation of oil production under the PSCs was no longer fair in view of the remarkable increase in oil prices. It considered that, because the State is the owner of the oil, it should benefit from the increase in oil prices to a greater extent than the contractor; however, under the terms of the PSCs, which allocated the majority of oil production to the contractor, the contractor would benefit from the increase in oil prices to a greater extent than the State.32\n\nRCM, \u00b6 172.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 188; RPHB, \u00b6 246.\n\n28.\n\nIn November 2005, at a time when the prices of Oriente and Napo crude were about USD 40/bbl, Ecuador invited Burlington to renegotiate the terms of the PSCs. Ecuador wished to increase its share of participation from around 22% to 50%.33 Burlington, however, rejected this proposal.34 According to Burlington, the allocation of oil production was independent of the price of oil. In addition, while the PSCs could be amended under certain circumstances, these circumstances did not \"include a change in oil prices or the perceived inequity of the production participations to which the parties agreed.\"35 As a result, Ecuador's proposed renegotiations failed.\n\nMem., \u00b6 207; First Supplemental Witness Statement of Alex Mart\u00ednez, 17 April 2009 (hereinafter \"Martinez Second WS\"), \u00b6 14.\n\n*Id*.\n\nMem., \u00b6 104 n. 141.\n\n29.\n\nOn 1 March 2006, following the breakdown of the renegotiations, Ecuadorian President Palacio submitted a bill to Congress proposing an additional participation for the State of \"at least 50%\"36 on so-called extraordinary profits, *i.e.* profits resulting from oil prices in excess of the price of oil as it stood when the PSCs were executed. In the letter explaining the purposes of the bill, President Palacio stated that the PSCs \"breach the principle of equity\" insofar as there is no clause that allows for a modification of the oil participation share in favor of the State in case of an increase in oil prices.37 The overall purpose of the bill was \"to restore equity\" in favor of the State.38 In the meantime, ConocoPhillips acquired Burlington on 31 March 2006.39\n\nRCM, \u00b6 215; Exh. E-130.\n\nExh. C-174, Explanatory Memorandum enclosed with letter of 1 March 2006, p. 2, first paragraph (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Id*., pp. 2-3 (Tribunal's translation).\n\nAccording to Ecuador, this was a very important event because ConocoPhillips \"knew about the negotiation of the contracts. They knew that Ecuador wanted to do that [renegotiate the PSCs]. They bought Burlington. They knew that Windfall Profits Taxes could be enacted. They had the China experience. And they also knew that Law 42 could be enacted. Why? Because President Palacio had already submitted the draft law, the bill, to Congress on the 1st of March 2006.\" (Tr. 1360:21-1361:11).\n\n30.\n\nOn 19 April 2006, Congress approved President Palacio's bill and enacted Law 42, which amended the Hydrocarbons Law as follows:\n\n\" **Participation of the State over non agreed or unforeseen surpluses from oil selling contracts. Contracting companies** having Hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation participation agreements in force with the Ecuadorian State pursuant to this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil which may correspond thereto according to their participation, in the event the actual monthly average selling price for the FOB sale of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the monthly average selling price in force at the date of execution of the agreement expressed at constant rates for the month of payment, **shall grant the Ecuadorian State a participation of at least 50%** **over the extraordinary revenues caused by such price difference** [\u2026].\"40 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-7, Article 2.\n\n31.\n\nAs the Tribunal previously concluded, Law 42 is a tax measure for purposes of this Treaty dispute.41 While Ecuador has argued that Law 42 is a \"levy\" rather than a \"ta\"x under its domestic law, it has conceded that \"for the purposes of the present case, any dispute as to the legal nature of Law 42 under Ecuadorian law is irrelevant.\"42 Any such dispute would be irrelevant because the Parties agree that, be it a tax or a levy, Law 42 is part of Ecuador's \"tax system\" within the meaning of the PSCs and its tax modification clauses.43 Therefore, for purposes of this decision, the Tribunal deems that Law 42 created a tax.\n\nDJ, \u00b6 167.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 287.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 369-370; RCM, \u00b6 287.\n\n32.\n\nUnder the Law 42 tax, oil companies had to pay 50% of the amount, if any, by which the market price of oil exceeds the price of oil at the time the PSCs were executed.44 In order to calculate the tax, it is necessary to determine:\n\n(i) First, the current market price of oil, defined as the actual monthly average oil spot prices (the \"market price\");\n\n(ii) Second, the market price of oil at the time the PSCs were executed adjusted for inflation (the \"statutory reference price\");\n\n(iii) Third, the tax which is equivalent to 50% of the difference, if any, between the market price and the statutory reference price.\n\nThe Law 42 tax applies to the oil company's gross income. Once other taxes and levies envisaged in the PSCs are deducted from this gross income, the base income is obtained. The employment contribution and the income tax are then assessed on this base income to determine the oil company's net income or profits (RCM, \u00b6 219).\n\n33.\n\nThe statutory reference price was about USD 25/bbl45 for Block 7 and USD 15/bbl46 for Block 21. This statutory reference price was adjusted for inflation and crude quality.47 In July 2006, for instance, the market price of Oriente crude from Block 7 was USD 66.56/bbl and the adjusted statutory reference price was USD 30.01/bbl. Therefore, the Law 42 tax was USD 18.28 per barrel of oil produced in Block 7 (50% of the difference between USD 66.56/bbl and USD 30.01/bbl).48 The market price of Napo crude from Block 21 at that time was USD 57.43/bbl49 and the statutory reference price about USD 18/bbl.50 Accordingly, the Law 42 tax was roughly USD 19.72 per barrel of oil produced in Block 21 (50% of the difference between USD 57.43/bbl and USD 18/bbl).\n\nThe exact initial statutory reference price for Block 7 was USD 25.111383 (Mem., \u00b6 219; Exh. C-178).\n\nThe exact initial statutory reference price for Block 21 was USD 15.358274 (Mem., \u00b6 219; Exh. C-178).\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 218, 342, 500, 502.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 299; ROSS # 118.\n\nMartinez, Oil Prices tab.\n\nAs there appears to be no evidence of the adjusted statutory reference price for Block 21 in July 2006, the Tribunal has applied to the Block 21 statutory reference price the same adjustment rate that was applied to the Block 7 statutory reference price, *i.e.* 20%. This computation is thus meant to be approximate and not exact.\n\n34.\n\nOn 6 September 2006, the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court declared that Law 42 was constitutional.51 Burlington paid the Law 42 tax under protest.52 By letters dated 18 December 2006, the Tax Consortium requested PetroEcuador to apply a correction factor that would absorb the effects of Law 42, allegedly in accordance with the tax modification clauses contained in the PSCs. Ecuador did not reply to these requests, allegedly on the ground that Burlington had failed to present evidence that Law 42 had an impact on the economy of the PSCs \u2013 an essential prerequisite for the application of the tax modification clauses.53\n\nRCM, \u00b6 217; Exh. CL-62.\n\nMem., \u00b6 220; Exh. C-9.\n\nWitness Galo Chiriboga, then Executive President of PetroEcuador, testified that the Consortium's requests were mistimed in light of the looming change of administration (Tr. 782:15-783:8).\n\n35.\n\nIn November 2006, Rafael Correa won the presidential elections, taking office in January 2007 and replacing President Palacio. On 18 October 2007, Ecuador issued Decree 662, which increased the Law 42 tax rate from 50% to 99% (\"Decree 662\" or \"Law 42 at 99%\"). In November 2007, for instance, the market price for Oriente crude from Block 7 was USD 83.20/bbl and the statutory reference price was USD 30.85/bbl. Thus, the Law 42 at 99% tax was USD 51.83/bbl (99% of the difference between USD 83.20/bbl and USD 30.85/bbl).54 In that month, the market price of Napo crude was USD 79.09/bbl55 and the statutory reference price of about USD 18/bbl.56 It follows that the Law 42 at 99% tax was roughly USD 60.48/bbl (99% of the difference between USD 79.09/bbl and USD 18/bbl).\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 299; ROSS # 118.\n\nMartinez, Oil Prices tab.\n\nSee *supra* note 50.\n\n36.\n\nBurlington paid the Law 42 at 99% tax under protest.57 By letters of 28 November 2007, the Tax Consortium again requested PetroEcuador to apply a correction factor to its oil participation share that would absorb the effects of Law 42 at 99%, allegedly in accordance with the tax modification clauses of the PSCs. As was the case with Law 42 at 50%, Ecuador did not respond to these requests, allegedly because Burlington had failed to prove that Law 42 at 99% had affected the economy of the PSCs and therefore that the requirements for the application of the tax modification clauses were met.\n\nMem., \u00b6 225; Exh. C-42.\n\n37.\n\nIn December 2007, Ecuador passed the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria* (\"LET\"), whose purported goal was to open a \"new avenue for negotiations with the oil companies\"58 which would allow \"them to avoid the application of Law 42\"59 at 99%. According to Ecuador, the LET allowed the State and the oil companies to agree \"fairer terms\"60 for the allocation of oil revenues. The LET presented the following three differences with respect to Law 42 at 99%: (i) its tax rate was 70%; (ii) the statutory reference price was not fixed by Ecuador but was subject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis; and (iii) it would apply only to those oil companies that agreed to enter into so-called \"transitory agreements\" \u2013 in the absence of such agreements, Law 42 would continue to apply.61\n\nRCM, \u00b6 221.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 223.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 222-224.\n\n38.\n\nOn 26 January 2008, in the wake of the enactment of Law 42 at 99% and the LET, President Rafael Correa gave a public radio address where he declared that oil companies had the following three options:\n\n\"We are renegotiating the oil contracts. Oil companies have three options:\n\n[1] either they comply with the 99-1 Decree, that is, of the extraordinary profits, extraordinary! [\u2026] Out of the extraordinary gains: 99 percent for the state and 1 percent for the company because the resource is ours. If they disagree, that's the first option, perfect.\n\n[2] We can renegotiate the contract into a services contract which always should have been the preponderant model in the oil industry. Why? Because if the oil is ours we hire somebody to take our oil out, right? We pay for the job, $10 for each barrel of oil extracted, but the rest is for us. So, that's the contract to which we want to go, which was in force at the beginning of the'90s [...]. What does \"participation contract\" mean? They exploit 100 barrels, they take out 100 barrels of our oil, the private and transnational oil companies, and they give us a little piece and the rest they take away [...]. And there are people who defend this. How shameful. They want to take us back into that opprobrious past, when they took away with no shame the resources of our country. This revolutionary, patriot and citizen government is renegotiating oil contracts and we want to go to such special service contracts, that's how they are called, where we pay $10 per each barrel of oil, whatever they consider appropriate...negotiating obviously, but the rest is for us, the owner of the resource. So that's the second option.\n\n[3] And the third option: If they are not happy, no problem. We don't want to rip-off anybody here. How much have they spent in investments? $200 million? Here, have your $200 million and have a nice day, and PetroEcuador will exploit that field. But we will not allow!\n\nMy compatriots, for them to keep taking away our oil. [\u2026] We have to put a limit: 45 days, or if not, they have to continue to comply with the 99-1.\"62\n\nExh. C-183; Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 20, 231, 416; CPHB \u00b6\u00b6 53, 83. (Tribunal's translation)..\n\n39.\n\nSpurred on by the LET and the new government policy, PetroEcuador, on behalf of Ecuador, and Perenco, on behalf of the Consortium, began renegotiations to reallocate oil revenues following the increase in oil prices, though this time against the background of Law 42 at 99%. In March 2008, PetroEcuador and Perenco reached a preliminary agreement to reallocate oil revenues from Blocks 7 and 21. The March 2008 Transitory Agreement provided that: (a) the Blocks would be operated under the PSC model for a period of five years and then would be migrated to another contract model (presumably service contracts); (b) the contract, whatever its modality, would be extended until 2018; (c) the State's oil participation share would be increased for the period 2008-2010, and then would be linked to oil prices for the period 2010-2018; (d) finally, the Law 42 statutory reference price would be increased to USD 42.5/bbl.63\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 228; RCM, \u00b6 228; Exh. E-133.\n\n40.\n\nBurlington complains that it was excluded from these negotiations because Ecuador requested to negotiate exclusively with Perenco. At the hearing, Alex Martinez, the Manager of Latin American Operations for ConocoPhillips and member of the Board of Directors of Burlington Oriente64, testified that \"the [PetroEcuador] negotiation team wants only the operator at the table, and they only want one person \u2013 one voice at the table. They don't want Burlington at the table, and they don't want Burlington to talk.\"65 Burlington argues, however, that although Perenco was the operator of the Block, it could not by itself renegotiate Burlington's rights under the PSCs.66\n\nWitness Statement of Alex Martinez, 20 February 2009 (hereinafter \"Martinez First WS\"), and Martinez Second WS; \u00b61.\n\nTr. 367:4-8; CPHB, \u00b6 225.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 226.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, on the other hand, Burlington has wrongly sought to create the impression that it was left out of the negotiation table and that Perenco failed to apprise it of the status of the negotiations. Ecuador claims that, by virtue of the Joint Operations Agreement, Perenco, as the operator of the Block, was \"to conduct negotiations with the State on behalf of the Consortium.\"67 In addition, whether Perenco apprised Burlington or not of the progress on the contract renegotiations was an internal matter for the Block partners to which Ecuador was alien.68\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 202.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 202-203.\n\n42.\n\nAt any rate, in April 2008, when Burlington was still \"in the midst of evaluating\"69 the terms of the March 2008 Transitory Agreement, Ecuador adopted a new \"single model\"70 policy with respect to the renegotiation of oil contracts. Under this new policy, all transitory agreements, including the March 2008 Transitory Agreement, would only be valid for a year, after which the parties would have to migrate to a service contract. In a public radio address delivered in mid-April, President Correa explained the rationale for this new policy and, referring back to his January public address, stated:\n\n\"I said 45 days, I think in January, for the renegotiation of the [oil] contracts\u2026 We were close to a deal, but I stopped it, because even though we've secured major benefits, I think that we can do better.\n\n[....]\n\nI believe that one of the best alternatives is to reach a transitory agreement, removing a series of absurd clauses from the current contracts, by which we practically surrendered our national sovereignty. It wasn't business being subjected to the country's sovereignty, but rather the country's sovereignty being subjected to business, [which] we cannot admit [...].\n\nSo it seems that the best alternative is to sign a transitory agreement until there is a new Constitution, and move toward a single contractual model for all of the [oil] companies. Basically, what was being done was to modify existing contracts, and we've improved a lot, but we think it is better to move toward this definitive solution of a \"single model\"71 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 369:8; CPHB, \u00b6 229.\n\nExh. C-184; CPHB, \u00b6 229.\n\nExh. C-184.\n\n43.\n\nAs Ecuador itself acknowledged, the decision to migrate to service contracts within a year \"suspended the negotiations with all oil companies, including Perenco and Burlington, for a few weeks.\"72 This decision would have even broader consequences in the case of Burlington, which filed a Request for Arbitration within days of President Correa's announcement of the new \"single model\" policy.73 According to Burlington, the decision to migrate to service contracts \"meant that Ecuador would reap the benefits of Burlington's substantial investment in and development of the Blocks, and at the same time would be the sole beneficiary of then-existing high oil prices and any future oil price increases.\"74\n\nRCM, \u00b6 229.\n\nMem., \u00b6 233; RCM, \u00b6 230.\n\nMem., \u00b6 233.\n\n44.\n\nNegotiations were resumed in May 2008. Consistent with President Correa's announcement, Ecuador submitted to Burlington a new draft Transitory Agreement by virtue of which (a) the Parties would make their \"best efforts\" to migrate to a service contract within 120 days75, (b) Burlington would maintain the levels of investment initially proposed for 200876, and (c) it would suspend the ICSID proceedings against Ecuador.77 Burlington did not accept the terms of this May 2008 Transitory Agreement.78\n\nExh. C-448, \u00a7\u00a7 4.2, 4.3.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 4.1.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 4.3. While Ecuador alleges that no transitory agreement contained an obligation \"to suspend\" the ICSID arbitration (RPHB, \u00b6 208), the May 2008 Transitory Agreement appears to contain just such an obligation at \u00a7 4.3.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 231; Tr. 372:8-375:22.\n\n45.\n\nOn 10 July 2008, Ecuador proposed still another draft Transitory Agreement whereby Perenco and Burlington would undertake to migrate to a service contract within one year of its execution.79 In a joint letter dated 16 July 2008, Burlington and Perenco replied that the terms of this new draft Transitory Agreement, which were \"substantially similar\"80 to those of the May 2008 Transitory Agreement, were \"unacceptable.\"81 On 20 August 2008, Roy Lyons, Burlington's Vice-President, wrote to Galo Chiriboga, Minister of Mines and Oil, to inform that Burlington \"would prefer to proceed with the divestment of its assets in Ecuador, rather than migrating its current Production Sharing Contracts positions into the model of a Services Contract.\"82\n\nExh. E-135, \u00a7 8.\n\nExh. E-136.\n\n*Id*.\n\nExh. E-138.\n\n46.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, from that point on, Burlington blocked every attempt to renegotiate the terms of the PSCs. Since Burlington's consent was indispensable for renegotiating the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21, this effectively forestalled an agreement between Ecuador and Perenco.83 In October 2008, Ecuador and Perenco recommenced negotiations and reached a preliminary agreement with respect to both Blocks 7 and 21. Perenco \"agreed to the principle of migrating to a services contract\"84, a higher statutory reference price (USD 42.5/bbl for Block 7 and USD 48/bbl for Block 21), and the application of the LET tax rate (70%) instead of Law 42 at 99%. The agreement also required the investor to commit to make a USD 110 million investment and to back up that commitment with a parent company guarantee.85\n\nRCM, \u00b6 236.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 242.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 232; Exh. C-422; clauses 3.3 and 5.\n\n47.\n\nPerenco was \"keen\"86 to have its minority partner in the Blocks sign these preliminary agreements (the \"November 2008 Transitory Agreements\"). Accordingly, in early November, Perenco provided Burlington with copies of the November 2008 Transitory Agreements87 and, on 27 November 2008, Perenco wrote to Burlington:\n\n\"In the continued spirit of keeping you apprised of developments between Perenco and the Government of Ecuador, I write to inform you that after extensive negotiations we have a draft transitory agreement that is acceptable to both Perenco on the one hand, and the Government of Ecuador and PetroEcuador on the other [...]. Perenco believes that the attached agreement is the best present alternative regarding Blocks 7 and 21.\n\nThe transitory agreement cannot become effective as to the consortium without Burlington's participation in it. We invite you to consider joining this agreement. If Burlington refuses to do so, there may be adverse consequences for both our companies and Perenco will be compelled to explore all possible means of preserving the value of its investments.\"88\n\nTr. 482:12-14.\n\nExh. C-422.\n\nExh. C-423, p. 1.\n\n48.\n\nBurlington, however, stated that it would \"not sign the draft transitory agreements\" because it was not \"interested in replacing the PSCs with Service Contracts.\"89 By letter dated 22 December 2008, Burlington replied to Perenco as follows:\n\n\"Our clear position has been and continues to be that Law 42 is unlawful and that we are entitled to recover all payments made to Ecuador in connection with Law 42 [...]. Similarly, as we look to the future, we expect to enjoy the benefits of the economics promised to us under the PSCs and the BITs [...]. As a result, we see no point in comparing the economics of the Transitory Agreement to the economics in place after Law 42 was initially implemented. The evaluation we have made, for our purposes, is how this agreement compares to the contracts, as written. In our view, it fails that test.\"90\n\nExh. C-46; Exh. C-425.\n\nExh. C-425. At the hearing, Mr. Martinez testified that under the November 2008 Transitory Agreements \"basically I'm giving up my Contract [the PSC]\" (Tr. 380:8-9). Mr. Martinez stated that \"unless you sign a Service Contract, by [the way] which I don't know what it looks like [\u2026] you get liquidated based on your nonamortized investments [\u2026]. How can I sign that? No businessman will sign that\" (Tr. 380:5-13).\n\n49.\n\nOn 23 December 2008, Derlis Palacios, Minister of Mines and Oil, invited Perenco, the operator of the Blocks, to designate a negotiating team to begin the reversion process of Block 7 \u2013 whose PSC was set to expire in August 2010 \u2013 and to \"terminate ahead of time and by mutual agreement\"91 the PSC for Block 21, as it was not possible to reach a final agreement due to the \"unchanging position of your partner Burlington Resources.\"92 On 7 January 2009, Burlington wrote to Minister Palacios requesting compensation for what was, in its understanding, the intended cancellation of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.93 On 21 January 2009, Minister Palacios reportedly stated that negotiations with Burlington and Perenco \"are 'practically impossible'\"94 and the PSCs are \"headed toward 'termination'.\"95\n\nExh.

C-50.\n\n*Id*.\n\n50.\n\nIn sum, the renegotiation process failed again. According to Ecuador, Burlington's refusal to accept the terms of the November 2008 Transitory Agreements \"only shows its complete bad faith and lack of true intention to find an amicable solution, agreeable to both sides.\"96 Burlington, on the other hand, argues that \"[r]enegotiating in good faith does not imply an obligation to accept *any* proposal by Ecuador\"97 (emphasis in original), and that it had valid reasons not to accept Ecuador's offers98; in the meantime, the terms of the PSCs should have been respected under the *pacta sunt servanda* principle.99\n\nRCM, \u00b6 242.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 236.\n\nBurlington argued *inter alia* that the terms of the service contracts to which the PSCs would have been migrated were unknown (CPHB, \u00b6 227; Martinez, Tr. 379:4-9; 380:10-12).\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 236.\n\n51.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the number of oil companies that agreed to enter into transitory agreements to migrate from PSCs into service contracts. According to Ecuador, almost all major oil producers which were invited to negotiate entered into transitory agreements with Ecuador. Out of a total of twenty-three contracts, fifteen were migrated to service contract.100 Burlington, by contrast, maintains that most oil companies did not accept the new service contract proposed by Ecuador. Of the fourteen PSCs in force when Law 42 at 50% was enacted in April 2006, only four were successfully converted into service contracts; the remaining oil companies either settled their claims before signing transitory agreements or signed transitory agreements but no service contracts.101\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 227-230. The record is slightly inconsistent on this point, partly on account of technical difficulties with the video link examination at the hearing. In the English transcript, Mr. Pastor Morris appears as testifying that 14 out of 24 contracts were migrated to services contract (Tr. 952:11-14). In the Spanish transcript, Mr. Pastor Morris appears as testifying that 15 out of 23 contracts were migrated to services contracts (Spanish Tr. 940:4-8), although it later testified that only 14 out of 23 were so migrated (Spanish Tr. 986:21-987:3). The variations, nevertheless, are of little consequence.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 237-244.\n\n**E.** ***C******OACTIVA*** **PROCEEDINGS, INTERVENTION IN THE BLOCKS AND** ***C******ADUCIDAD*** **DECREES**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nWhile the contract renegotiations were ongoing, Burlington continued to pay the Law 42 tax. Burlington paid the Law 42 tax to Ecuador for two consecutive years, from April 2006 to May 2008. In June 2008, however, Burlington stopped paying the Law 42 tax to Ecuador. By that time, the Tax Consortium, which had paid around USD 400 million in Law 42 taxes, grew \"concerned about the exponential increase in the amounts in dispute and the lack of a clear path to reach a negotiated solution.\"102 Therefore, on 19 June 2008, the Tax Consortium wrote to Ecuador to propose that future Law 42 payments be made \"into an escrow account, maintained by an independent escrow agent in a neutral location, pending resolution of our dispute either by settlement or award.\"103\n\nMem., \u00b6 229 (quotation marks omitted); Exh. C-48.\n\nExh. C-48, pp. 3-4.\n\n53.\n\nAt the time, Ecuador did not respond to the Tax Consortium's request.104 At the hearing, Germ\u00e1nico Pinto, who would simultaneously become Minister of NonRenewable Resources and President of the Board of Director of PetroEcuador and PetroAmazonas for a ten-month stint105, testified that no country in the world would accept the Tax Consortium's proposal.106 In the same vein, former Minister of Mines and Oil Galo Chiriboga stated that \"tax laws in Ecuador, and I think in many parts of the world, are mandatory\", for which reason accepting the Tax Consortium's proposal would not be \"possible anywhere in the world.\"107\n\nMem., \u00b6 229.\n\nWitness Statement of Germanico Pinto, 17 January 2011 (hereinafter \"Pinto WS\"), \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\nTr. 724:8-12.\n\nTr. 802:4-12.\n\n54.\n\nHaving commenced this arbitration and received no answer from Ecuador on its escrow account proposal, the Tax Consortium decided to make future Law 42 payments into a segregated account. From June 2008 to April 2009, Burlington paid around USD 150 million into this segregated account located in the United States. Ecuador referred to this decision as a \"blatant and unlawful act of defiance on the Consortium's part.\"108 At the hearing, Minister Pinto gave evidence to the effect that the Consortium's decision to stop paying the Law 42 tax to Ecuador \"was creating a challenging situation.\"109 Similarly, Minister Chiriboga testified as follows:\n\n\"[C]itizens [..] do not have the power to decide whether they pay a tax or not. We do have the option to discuss--pay the tax, and discuss before a court whether this is legal or not, but we cannot accept that tomorrow a taxpayer will tell an authority \"I am not going to pay to the State. I am going to deposit this money in an account, and whenever the judge or the court that is hearing the case decides on this, we'll see what we do.\"110\n\nRCM, \u00b6 13.\n\nTr. 743:3-14.\n\nTr. 802:16-803:3.\n\n55.\n\nOn 14 February 2009, following the breakdown of the renegotiations, President Correa stated at a press conference that:\n\n\"[T]wo companies, Perenco and Repsol, with which Burlington is also allied, have wasted our time. When an agreement was near, they backed out. I believe, I fear, that they thought they were still dealing with previous administrations. Which, gentlemen, we will not permit\n\n[....]\n\n[S]ince they have not paid their taxes on extraordinary profits, I have ordered enforcement actions against Repsol and Perenco, and these companies can go wherever they like. This country will not pay attention to extra-regional authorities that attempt to tell us what to do or not to do.\"111\n\nExh. C-51, pp. 2-3 (Claimant's translation); Mem., \u00b6 237; CSM, \u00b6 37.\n\n56.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, Ecuador began *coactiva* proceedings against the Consortium to enforce outstanding taxes in the amount of USD 327.3 million. In accordance with this proceeding, the Executory Tribunal of PetroEcuador (the \"Executory Tribunal\") sent three *coactiva* notices to Perenco, the operator of the Blocks, ordering payment of the overdue tax within three days, failing which assets would be attached. On 3 March 2009, the Executory Tribunal ordered the seizure of the crude production and cargo from Blocks 7 and 21, appointing a judicial custodian of the crude. This decision was confirmed on 9 March 2009 by an Ecuadorian judicial court.112\n\nExh. C-60.\n\n57.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, upon the application of Burlington Oriente113, this Tribunal recommended \"that the Respondents [Ecuador and PetroEcuador114] refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the *status quo* until it decides on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures or it reconsiders the present recommendation, whichever is first.\"115 Despite this recommendation, Ecuador held the first auction of seized crude on 15 May 2009, but no bids were submitted and the seized oil remained unsold.116\n\nOriginally one of the claimants in this arbitration, Burlington Oriente ceased to be a party to these proceedings after the contract claims were withdrawn (DJ, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 78-80).\n\nPetroEcuador was initially one of the two respondents to the case, along with Ecuador (DJ, \u00b6 53).\n\nTribunal's recommendation of 6 March 2009, \u00b6 13; Mem., \u00b6 246; CSM, \u00b6 43.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 47.\n\n58.\n\nOn 29 June 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on provisional measures, wherein it generally ordered that the Parties \"refrain from any conduct that may lead to an aggravation of the dispute.\"117 In order to carry out this objective, the Tribunal specifically directed the Parties to \"make their best efforts\"118 to open a joint escrow account into which Law 42 payments would be made, and the Respondents to \"discontinue\"119 the *coactiva* proceedings pending against Burlington Oriente. Procedural Order No. 1 notwithstanding, a second auction was conducted in early July 2009: PetroEcuador, the sole bidder on this occasion, acquired the seized crude at 50% of its market value \u2013 as allowed under Ecuadorian law.120\n\nPO1, *Order* at 8.\n\n*Id*., at 1-6.\n\n*Id*., at 7.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 53. In accordance with the Ecuadorian Code of Civil Procedure, offers in the first auction round may not be lower than two-thirds of the appraised value of the auctioned asset; if there are no bidders in the first round, a new round is to be organized and the minimum offer this time may not be lower than 50% of the appraised value of the auctioned asset (RCM, \u00b6 539).\n\n59.\n\nAt subsequent auctions, PetroEcuador, still the sole bidder, acquired the seized oil in the first round for about two-thirds of its value \u2013 again in conformity with Ecuadorian law. The Parties present diverging accounts on why PetroEcuador was the sole bidder at the auctions. Burlington conjectures that \"potential bidders were aware that ownership of the cargoes was in dispute and subject to the provisional measures rulings of the *Burlington* and *Perenco* tribunals.\"121 Ecuador retorts that this explanation is misleading, and that the real reason why there were no bidders other than PetroEcuador is that the Consortium threatened legal action against any company that would acquire the seized crude.122\n\nCSM, \u00b6 53.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 548.\n\n60.\n\nAlthough Burlington stopped paying the Law 42 tax in June 2008, it was not until February 2009 that Ecuador took enforcement action. The Parties disagree on the reasons behind this timing. Burlington claims that this delayed enforcement of the law is evidence that the *coactiva* process was nothing but retaliation for its refusal to surrender its rights under the PSCs during the renegotiation process, which essentially ended in December 2008.123 For its part, Ecuador denies this as a complete mischaracterization of the facts. Ecuador argues that it did not take enforcement action before because the Law 42 tax was liquidated on an annual basis and also to avoid a \"heavy-handed\"124 environment that could have marred the negotiations.125\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 87, 90; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 88-106.\n\nTr. 842:6-11.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 365-375.\n\n61.\n\nThe seizures of the Consortium's crude stretched from March to July 2009. All in all, by the time the last recorded auction was held in April 2010, Ecuador had auctioned 3,960,000 barrels of crude Oriente from Block 7 and 3,640,000 barrels of crude Napo from Block 21.126 The following chart127 summarizes the outcome of eight auction rounds of the Consortium's crude, covering most of the crude seized from the Consortium and acquired by PetroEcuador.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Block 7 Crude Oriente** | **Block 21 Crude \u00d1apo** |\n| Amount (Barrels) | Bidding Price (USS) | Valuation (US$) | Benefit to the State (US$) | Amount (Barrels) | Bidding Price (US$) | Valuation or Nominal Price (US$) | Benefit to the State (US$) | **Discount** |\n| 1 | 720,000 | 20,962,441 | 41,924,880 | 20,962,439 | 720,000 | 20,052,361 | 40,104,720 | 20,052,359 | **50%** |\n| 2 | 720,000 | 27,980,642 | 41,970,960 | 13,990,318 | 360,000 | 13,382,641 | 20,073,960 | 6,691,319 | **33%** |\n| 3 | 360,000 | 14,455,201 | 21,682,800 | 7,227,559 | 360,000 | 13,975,201 | 20,962,800 | 6,987,599 | **33%** |\n| 4 | 360,000 | 16,044,001 | 24,066,000 | 8,021,999 | 360,000 | 16,044,001 | 21,546,000 | 5,501,999 | **33%** |\n| 5 | 360,000 | 16,620,001 | 24,930,000 | 8,309,999 | 400,000 | 14,737,601 | 22,106,400 | 7,368,799 | **33%** |\n| 6 | 360,000 | 16,140,001 | 24,210,000 | 8,069,999 | 360,000 | 14,472,001 | 21,708,000 | 7,235,999 | **33%** |\n| 7 | 360,000 | 18,300,001 | 27,450,000 | 9,149,999 | 360,000 | 17,712,001 | 26,568,000 | 8,855,999 | **33%** |\n| 8 | 360,000 | 18,369,601 | 27,554,400 | 9,184,799 | 360,000 | 17,827,201 | 26,740,800 | 8,913,599 | **33%** |\n| Total per Block | 3,600,000 | 148,871,899 | 233,789,040 | 84,917,151 | 3,280,000 | 128,203,008 | 199,810,680 | 71,607,672 |  |\n\nCSM, \u00b6 76.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 104.\n\n62.\n\nOn account of the *coactiva* seizures and auctions, the Consortium decided to cease operations in the Block. By letter of 13 July 2009, the Consortium informed the Ministry of Mines and Oil (the \"Ministry\") that \"[u]nder the circumstances, [\u2026] we are left with no choice but to suspend\" operations in Blocks 7 and 21.128 The Consortium noted that it planned to \"commence suspension of activities at noon July 16th, 2009\" unless Ecuador and PetroEcuador \"remedy their current breaches and deliver back to the Consortium the entirety of the seized crude volumes, or pay a cash equivalent market value.\"129\n\nExh. C-208, p. 3.\n\n*Id*.; CSM, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; RCM, \u00b6 571.\n\n63.\n\nOn 15 July 2009, the Consortium sent a new letter to the Ministry detailing a schedule of the planned suspension.130 On the same date, the Ministry replied to the Consortium that this decision was \"illegal\"131 and \"would cause serious technical and economic losses to the government of Ecuador.\"132 On 16 July 2009, after the suspension was scheduled to occur, Ecuador entered the Blocks, without using force, to ensure their continued operation.133 On the same day, PetroEcuador passed a resolution declaring the state of emergency in the Blocks, and authorizing PetroAmazonas to adopt any measure necessary to guarantee the continuity of operations.134 Ever since, Ecuador has been in possession of the Blocks.135\n\nExh.

Burlington refers to this decision as a \"suspension\" of operations, because the Consortium could have \"resume[d] normal operations in relatively short order should Ecuador [have] cease[d] its unlawful actions.\"136 At the hearing, Mr. Martinez testified on direct examination that the Consortium had not contemplated suspending operations prior to the seizures.137 Ecuador, on the other hand, describes the Consortium's decision as an \"abandonment\" of the Blocks.138 At the hearing, Mr. Martinez conceded that the suspension could have lasted for the entire duration of the *Perenco* and the *Burlington* arbitrations.139\n\n*Id.,*, \u00b6 62.\n\nTr. 547:3-5.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 572, 578, 588.\n\nTr. 519:7-13.\n\n65.\n\nIn September 2009, at PetroEcuador's request, the Minister of Non-Renewable Natural Resources initiated the so-called *caducidad* process to terminate the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. Perenco, on behalf of the Consortium, opposed the initiation of the process, albeit to no effect: the Minister did not accept the Consortium's objections.140 Thus, on 20 July 2010, one year after Ecuador's entry into the Blocks, the Minister of Non-Renewable Natural Resources declared the termination \u2013 or *caducidad* \u2013 of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.141\n\nExhs.

Pursuant to this amendment, all PSCs had to be migrated to service contracts within a 120-day period \u2013 *i.e.* by the end of November 2010; if the PSCs were not migrated within that time period, they would be unilaterally terminated \u2013 albeit through a process other than *caducidad* \u2013 and the Ministry of Hydrocarbons would at that point \"determine the value and method of payment for each contract.\"142\n\nExh.

INITIAL PHASE**\n--------------------\n\n67.\n\nOn 21 April 2008, Burlington and the Burlington Subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Initial Claimants\"), filed a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") against Ecuador and PetroEcuador (the \"Initial Respondents\"), enclosing forty-five exhibits.143 In the Request, the Initial Claimants asked for the following relief:\n\n\"(a) DECLARE that Ecuador has breached:\n\n(i) Article III of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures tantamount to expropriation with respect to Burlington's investments in Ecuador;\n\n(ii) Article II of the Treaty by failing to treat Burlington's investments in Ecuador on a basis no less favorable than that accorded [to] nationals; by failing to accord Burlington's investments fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and treatment no less than that required by international law; by implementing arbitrary and discriminatory measures against Burlington's investments; and by failing to observe its obligations with regard to Burlington's investments; and\n\n(iii) Each of the PSC;\n\n(b) ORDER Ecuador: (i) to pay damages to Burlington for its breaches of the Treaty in an amount to be determined at a later stage in these proceedings, including payment of compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the effective and complete payment of the award of damages for the breach of the Treaty; and/or (ii) to specific performance of its obligations under the PSCs and pay damages for its breaches of the PSCs in an amount to be determined at a later stage in the proceedings, including interest at such a rate as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the complete payment of all damages for breach of the PSCs.\n\n(c) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n\n(d) ORDER Ecuador and PetroEcuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Burlington's legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID's other costs.\"144\n\nExhs. C-1 to C-45.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 136.\n\n68.\n\nOn 25 April 2008, the Centre transmitted a copy of the Request to Ecuador and to PetroEcuador in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"). On 2 June 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or the \"Convention\") and dispatched the Notice of Registration to the Parties, inviting them to proceed to constitute the arbitral tribunal.\n\n69.\n\nSince the Parties did not agree on a different procedure within the meaning of Rule 2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), the Initial Claimants opted to constitute the arbitral tribunal pursuant to the formula established in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Under this formula, \"the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the president of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the parties.\"\n\n70.\n\nOn 4 August 2008, the Initial Claimants appointed as arbitrator Prof. Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a Chilean national. On 22 September 2008, the Respondent appointed as arbitrator Prof. Brigitte Stern, a French national. On 27 October 2008, the Parties agreed to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. All three arbitrators accepted their appointments. In addition, the Centre selected Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. On 18 November 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") was deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun.\n\n71.\n\nOn 20 January 2009, the Tribunal held a first procedural session at the World Bank's office in Paris. At the first session, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and raised no objection to the appointment of the members of the Tribunal. Furthermore, the Parties and the Tribunal agreed on a number of procedural issues. The first session was audio-recorded and transcribed in both English and Spanish. Minutes of the first session were drafted, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and transmitted to the Parties on 18 February 2009. Later that month, the Parties also expressed their consent to the procedural calendar proposed by the Tribunal.\n\n72.\n\nOn 20 February 2009, Burlington Oriente, the subsidiary holding Claimant's ownership interests in Blocks 7 and 21, filed a Request for Provisional Measures (the \"RPM\"), together with a request for a temporary restraining order with immediate effect (the \"TRO Request\"), asking that the Initial Respondents refrain from (i) enforcing payments allegedly due under Law 42; (ii) affecting the legal situation or terminating the Block 7 and 21 PSCs; and (iii) engaging in any conduct that may aggravate the dispute between the Parties. The RPM was accompanied by twelve exhibits145, thirteen legal exhibits146, and the witness statement of Alex Martinez. On 4 March 2009, Ecuador filed a Preliminary Reply to Burlington Oriente's RPM, enclosing three exhibits147 and nineteen legal exhibits.148\n\nExhs. C-46 to C-57.\n\nExhs. CL-1 to CL-13.\n\nExhs. E-3 to E-5.\n\nExhs. EL-1 to EL-19.\n\n73.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal recommended \"that the [Initial] Respondents refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the *status quo* until it decides on the Claimants\u2018 Request for Provisional Measures or it reconsiders the present recommendation, whichever is first.\"149 On 17 March 2009, Ecuador filed a Reply to Burlington Oriente's RPM and a request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's 6 of March 2009 recommendation, along with five exhibits150 and seven legal exhibits.151 Eight days later, Burlington Oriente objected to Ecuador's request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's 6 of March 2009 recommendation. On 27 March 2009, Burlington Oriente filed its Response to Ecuador's Reply to the RPM, accompanied by eleven exhibits152 and eight legal exhibits.153\n\nTribunal's recommendation of 6 March 2009, \u00b613 (emphasis added).\n\nExhs. E-6 to E-10.\n\nExhs. EL-20 to EL-26.\n\nExhs. C-58 to C-68.\n\nExhs. CL-14 to CL-21.\n\n74.\n\nOn 3 April 2009, the Tribunal denied Ecuador's request for reconsideration of its 6 March 2009 recommendation on the double ground that there were no changed circumstances that would warrant such reconsideration, and that the hearing on provisional measures would take place shortly thereafter. On 6 April 2006, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder to Burlington Oriente's RPM, enclosing six exhibits154 and fifteen legal exhibits.155 On 17 April 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on provisional measures in Washington D.C., at which counsel for the Parties presented oral arguments and answered questions from the Tribunal. The hearing was transcribed in English and Spanish and copies of the transcript were distributed to the Parties.\n\nExhs. E-11 to E-16.\n\nExhs. EL-27 to EL-41.\n\n75.\n\nOn 29 June 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on provisional measures. It ordered the Parties to \"refrain from any conduct that may lead to an aggravation of the dispute.\"156 In order to implement this general objective, it specifically ordered that the Parties \"make their best efforts\"157 to open a joint escrow account into which Law 42 payments would be made, and that the Respondent \"discontinue\"158 the *coactiva* proceedings then pending against Burlington Oriente.159 This order replaced the Tribunal's recommendation of 6 March 2009.\n\nPO1, *Order* at 8.\n\n*Id*., at 1-6.\n\n*Id*., at 7.\n\nThe Tribunal's order notwithstanding, a second auction was conducted in early July 2009: PetroEcuador, the sole bidder on this occasion, acquired the seized crude at 50% of its market value \u2013 as allowed under Ecuadorian law. (CSM, \u00b6 53).\n\n76.\n\nOn 18 September 2009, the Initial Claimants withdrew their contract claims (the \"Contract Claims\") on the alleged ground that Ecuador had physically occupied the Blocks, bringing \"to completion the expropriation that began with the enactment of Law 42.\"160 Burlington was to continue to pursue its claims under the Treaty (the \"Treaty Claims\"). The Initial Claimants wrote:\n\n\"In this context, and as announced at the First Session, the Claimants respectfully inform the Tribunal that the Contract Claimants [the Burlington Subsidiaries] hereby withdraw their contractual claims, including those relating to Block 23 and 24, without prejudice, and confirm that Burlington maintains its claims under the Treaty [the \"Treaty Claims\"]\".161\n\nThe Initial Claimants' letter of 18 September 2009, Exh. C-189, p. 2.\n\n*Id*.\n\n77.\n\nOn 22 September 2009, the Initial Respondents denied that it had expropriated Blocks 7 and 21, but agreed to the withdrawal of the Contract Claims provided that the withdrawal was \"with prejudice\".162 The Initial Respondents also requested that the Tribunal withdraw Procedural Order No. 1 because Burlington Oriente had abandoned operations in Blocks 7 and 21.163\n\nExh. E-118, p. 2\n\nExh. C-189, p. 3\n\n78.\n\nOn 10 October 2009, the Initial Claimants \"accept[ed] that any withdrawal of the contractual claims should be with prejudice\" because they saw \"no reason to preserve [the] right to re-file the contractual claims in the future.\"164 By the same token, they agreed that Procedural Order No. 1 be withdrawn as \"[m]aintaining the Order would therefore serve no purpose.\"165 Subsequently on 20 October 2009, the Initial Claimants confirmed that \"PetroEcuador is no longer a party to these proceedings\" following the withdrawal of the Contract Claims.166\n\nThe Initial Claimants' letter of 10 October 2009, Exh. C-190, pp. 1 and 2.\n\n*Id*., at 2.\n\nThe Initial Claimants' letter of 20 October 2009, Exh. E-121, p. 1.\n\n79.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\n\"1. Provided that the [Initial] Respondents make no objection by 6 November 2009, the Contract Claims will be deemed withdrawn with prejudice as of that date. Consequently, as of 6 November 2009, PetroEcuador and, subject to the [Initial] Claimants' confirmation by 2 November 2009, [the Burlington Subsidiaries] will cease to be parties to this dispute. As a result, this arbitration will deal solely with Burlington's Treaty Claims against Ecuador.\n\n2. Procedural Order No. 1 is hereby revoked. Any funds in the escrow account are therefore released to the [Initial] Claimants.\" [The Tribunal nonetheless \"specified that the Parties remain under a duty not to further aggravate the dispute\"].167\n\nPO2, *Order* at 1-2 and \u00b6 29.\n\n80.\n\nIn accordance with such order, the Initial Claimants confirmed on 2 November 2009 that the Burlington Subsidiaries were no longer parties to these proceedings and that the Contract Claims were withdrawn. For their part, the Initial Respondents did not object to the withdrawal with prejudice of the Contract Claims by the specified date. Accordingly, as of 6 November 2009, the Contract Claims were withdrawn with prejudice and PetroEcuador and the Burlington Subsidiaries ceased to be parties to these proceedings. From that time on, this arbitration is confined to Burlington's Treaty Claims against Ecuador.\n\n**B. JURISDICTIONAL PHASE**\n---------------------------\n\n81.\n\nOn 20 April 2009, the Initial Claimants submitted their Memorial, accompanied by one hundred and twenty exhibits168, one hundred and six legal exhibits169, the witness statements of Taylor Reid and Herb Vickers, and the first supplemental witness statement of Alex Martinez. In addition, the Initial Claimants submitted complete versions of the PSCs for Blocks 7, 21, 23 and 24170, with authorizations, annexes and English translations.\n\nExhs. C-69 to C-188.\n\nExhs. CL-22 to CL-127.\n\nExhs. C-1 to C-4.\n\n82.\n\nOn 20 May 2009, Ecuador and PetroEcuador announced in separate correspondence that they would object to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. On 20 July 2009, Ecuador and PetroEcuador filed separate Objections to Jurisdiction. Ecuador filed its Objections to Jurisdiction together with ninety-nine exhibits171, fourteen legal exhibits172, the witness statement of Dr. Christian D\u00e1valos, and the expert reports of Prof. Juan Pablo Aguilar and Prof. Luis Parraguez Ruiz.\n\nExhs. E-17 to E-115.\n\nExhs. EL-41 to EL-55.\n\n83.\n\nOn 20 October 2009, Burlington filed a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, enclosing ten exhibits173 and twenty-one legal exhibits.174 Burlington did not append any witness statement of expert opinion to its submission. Because the Burlington Subsidiaries would soon cease to be parties to this arbitration, only Burlington filed a CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction.175\n\nExhs. C-189 to C-198.\n\nExhs. CL-128 to CL-148.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\n84.\n\nOn 30 October 2009, the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing telephone conference to organize the hearing on jurisdiction. Shortly thereafter, the Tribunal circulated Procedural Order No. 3 addressing a number of procedural issues related to the impending hearing. The hearing on jurisdiction took place on 22 January 2010 at the World Bank's offices in Paris. On 2 June 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal dispatched the Decision on Jurisdiction to the Parties.\n\n85.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal declared that: (i) it had jurisdiction over the expropriation claim; (ii) it lacked jurisdiction over the fair and equitable treatment claim, the arbitrary impairment claim, and the full protection and security claim; (iii) it would join to the merits the issue of whether it had jurisdiction over Burlington's Law 42 first umbrella clause claim and over the first limb of its third umbrella clause claim; (iv) Burlington's second umbrella clause claim and the second limb of its third umbrella clause claim had lapsed on their own terms; and (v) Burlington's full protection and security claims for Blocks 23 and 24 were inadmissible.176\n\nDJ, \u00b6 342, A-E.\n\n**C. LIABILITY PHASE AND COUNTERCLAIMS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nFrom the time Burlington began this arbitration in April 2008, significant new events took place \u2013 most notably, the *coactiva* proceedings, Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks, and the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. For this reason, the Parties agreed that Burlington would have the opportunity to file a supplemental memorial. Thus, on 29 September 2010, Burlington submitted a Supplemental Memorial on Liability, together with fifty-two exhibits177, eighteen legal exhibits178, and the second supplemental witness statement of Alex Martinez.\n\nExhs. C-199 to C-250.\n\nExhs. CL-149 to CL-166.\n\n87.\n\nOn 17 January 2011, Ecuador presented its Counter-Memorial on Liability (the \"Counter-Memorial\"), accompanied by seventy exhibits179, ninety-seven legal exhibits180, and the witness statements of Wilson Pastor, Germ\u00e1nico Pinto, Derlis Palacios, Galo Chiriboga, Celio Vega, Pablo Luna, the second witness statement of Christian D\u00e1valos, the expert reports of Fair Links, RPS, IEMS, and the second expert report of Juan Pablo Aguilar. In the Counter-Memorial, Ecuador asserted counterclaims against Burlington for damage to the environment and the infrastructure in Blocks 7 and 21.181\n\nExhs. E-117 to E-186.\n\nExhs. EL-64 to EL-162 (with two exhibits intentionally left blank).\n\nRCM, \u00a7 9.\n\n88.\n\nOn 20 January 2011, the Tribunal and the Parties held a telephone conference to discuss various procedural matters in connection with the forthcoming hearing on liability. On 28 January 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, deciding that, while the hearing on liability would be devoted solely to Burlington's claims, the Tribunal and the Parties would hold a procedural discussion at the end of the hearing to address Ecuador's counterclaims. The Tribunal also issued directions with respect to various matters related to the organization of the hearing, and proposed the appointment of Mr. Gustavo Laborde as assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n89.\n\nOn 7 February 2011, the Tribunal circulated Procedural Order No. 5 granting in part Ecuador's request for document disclosure. On 21 February 2011, Burlington objected to Ecuador's planned cross-examination of Herb Vickers on the ground that this examination would exceed the scope of Mr. Vickers' witness statement. On 2 March 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 allowing Ecuador to cross-examine Mr. Vickers on limited and specified topics. Furthermore, having received the consent of both Parties, the Tribunal confirmed the appointment of Mr. Gustavo Laborde as assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n90.\n\nThe hearing on liability was held from 8 to 11 March 2011 at the World Bank offices in Paris. At the hearing, both Parties submitted new exhibits into the record. Burlington submitted two hundred and five new exhibits182 and sixty-eight legal exhibits183.

At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties held a procedural discussion in relation to the post-hearing briefs and the procedural treatment of Ecuador's counterclaims.\n\n93.\n\nOn 15 March 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, where (i) it took note of the discontinuance of the proceedings in relation to Burlington's pending claims for Blocks 23 and 24 following settlement agreements; (ii) fixed the date for the simultaneous submission of post-hearing briefs; and (iii) set a date by which Burlington would inform whether it intended to raise jurisdictional objections to Ecuador's counterclaims. On 6 May 2011, the Parties simultaneously filed their post-hearing briefs. On 27 May 2011, Burlington advised the Tribunal that it would raise no jurisdictional objections in respect of Ecuador's counterclaims, in accordance with an agreement executed the previous day.186\n\nThis agreement was entered into between Burlington Resources, Burlington Oriente, and Burlington Resources International, on the one hand, and Ecuador, on the other hand (*see* Exh.

On 15 February, the Tribunal approved the Parties' amendment to the procedural calendar, subject to Ecuador's approval.\n\n**III. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. **BURLINGTON'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n96.\n\nFollowing the Decision on Jurisdiction, Burlington's case can essentially be summarized as follows:\n\n(i) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Burlington's umbrella clause claims; with respect to the merits, Ecuador has failed to observe its obligations, contained both in laws and regulations and in the PSCs, with respect to Burlington's investments (the \"umbrella clause claim\");\n\n(ii) Ecuador unlawfully expropriated Burlington's investment; specifically, Ecuador's measures, to wit, (i) Law 42, (ii) the coactiva process and seizures, (iii) the physical occupation of Blocks 7 and 21, and (iv) the termination of the PSCs in the caducidad process, individually and in the aggregate, effected an unlawful expropriation of Burlington's investment (the \"expropriation claim\");\n\n(iii) As a result of the foregoing Treaty breaches, Ecuador must pay damages to Burlington in an amount to be determined in the quantum phase of these proceedings.\n\n1. Burlington's Umbrella Clause Claim\n-------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nBurlington presents claims under the observance of obligations clause of Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, *i.e.* the so-called umbrella clause. Burlington alleges that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims (1.1) and that Ecuador breached the umbrella clause by failing to observe its obligations with regard to Burlington's investment (1.2).\n\n1.1. Jurisdiction over the umbrella clause claims\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nBurlington submits that (i) Ecuador's obligations to Burlington arise not only from the PSCs but also from its hydrocarbons-related laws and regulations; (ii) that the withdrawal of the contract claims under the PSCs does not preclude it from pursuing Treaty claims under the umbrella clause; and (iii) that, for purpose of the umbrella clause claims based on the PSCs, the Treaty does not require privity of contract between Burlington and Ecuador.\n\n99.\n\nFirst, Ecuador's obligations to Burlington are not limited to contractual obligations under the PSCs, but also encompass the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. Unilateral commitments made with respect to a reasonably specific class of investors are within the scope of application of the umbrella clause. Support for this broad construction of umbrella clauses is to be found in *Noble Energy*, *Continental Casualty*, *Revere Copper* and *Noble Ventures*. Investors such as Burlington rely on these unilateral commitments to plan and make their investments.189\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 266-278; Tr. 1314:17-1315:16.\n\n100.\n\nSecond, Ecuador's argument that there is no underlying contractual obligation that could be elevated to the Treaty level because of the withdrawal of the contract claims is flawed. In fact, contract and Treaty claims have \"separate lives.\"190 When Ecuador breached the PSCs, two separate and independent sets of claims arose; one under the contracts, another under the Treaty. These sets of claims involve different parties and different legal sources. Burlington may pursue one set of rights without pursuing the other. The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction already confirmed that these two sets of claims are independent; yet, an undaunted Ecuador reiterates its objections at the merits phase.191\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 262.\n\nTr. 151:11-153:21, Tr. 1294:2-1296:16. Counsel for Burlington further added that \"Ecuador is surely estopped as a matter of good faith from alleging that [\u2026] Burlington's treaty claim, which had been there from the beginning and was quite visibly not being withdrawn, somehow evaporated\" as a result of the subsidiary's withdrawal of the contract claims (Tr. 1294:18-22).\n\n101.\n\nThird, the Treaty's umbrella clause does not require privity between Burlington and Ecuador. This follows from the plain language of the Treaty. The umbrella clause applies to (i) \"any obligation\" (ii) that Ecuador \"may have entered into with regard to\" (iii) Burlington's \"investments.\" All three elements are met in this case. The PSCs contain legal obligations. Ecuador has indisputably assumed the obligations contained in the PSCs, *i.e.* it has \"entered into\" these obligations. These obligations have been entered into \"with regard to [Burlington's] investments.\" This is all the Treaty requires.\n\n102.\n\nThe umbrella clause refers to obligations entered into with regard to \"investments\", not with regard to \"investors.\" This choice of words is significant. The Contracting Parties to the Treaty \u2013 Ecuador and the United States \u2013 could have used a narrower formulation incorporating a privity element, but instead \"deliberately chose the broader term.\"192 Additionally, Ecuador's allegation that there is a \"series of consistent cases\"193 requiring privity for purposes of the umbrella clause is belied by the decision in *Continental Casualty*. Further, a privity component would be contrary to the spirit of the Treaty, which in accordance with Article I of the Treaty is also to protect indirect investments.194\n\nTr. 148:4-6.\n\nTr. 199:2-3.\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 125-131, 135.\n\n1.2. Ecuador breached its obligations with regard to Burlington's investments\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador breached the umbrella clause because it failed to observe its obligations with respect to Burlington's investment. First, Ecuador failed to absorb the effects of Law 42 on Burlington. While Ecuador denies being under such obligation, Burlington argues that its share of oil production was independent of the price of oil \u2013 the rationale behind Law 42 \u2013 and that Ecuador was bound to indemnify Burlington for any tax having an impact on the economy of the PSCs. Second, Ecuador failed to deliver to Burlington its share of oil production according to the formulas set out in the PSCs.195 These breaches are not excused under the principle *rebus sic stantibus*196, upon which Ecuador denies relying despite referring to the requirements for its application.197\n\nMem., \u00b6 369; CSM, \u00b6 123.\n\nA party invoking the *rebus sic stantibus* principle must show (i) that an extraordinary and unforeseeable or unforeseen event caused an imbalance in the obligation of the parties; (ii) that the imbalance is such that performance of the contract would be excessively burdensome for one of the parties; and (iii) that the event causing the imbalance should not be a consequence of the actions or omissions of the party invoking the principle (CPHB, \u00b6 203).\n\nBurlington claims that Ecuador refers to the requirements underlying the principle *rebus sic stantibus* in its submissions and expert reports (CPHB, \u00b6 201).\n\n104.\n\nBurlington had the right to receive the upside of any oil price increase.198 Under the PSCs, its share of oil production was not dependent on the price of oil. It follows that Burlington was entitled to receive the full market value of its share of oil production, subject only to the payment of the taxes and employment contributions specified in the PSCs. In addition, in the event that a tax had an impact on the economy of the contract, a correction factor would have to be applied in order to absorb the effect of that tax. In this case, Law 42 had an impact on the economy of the PSCs, and Ecuador was therefore under an obligation to absorb its effects.199\n\nMem., \u00b6 354; CSM, \u00b6 19; Tr. 24:17-25:15; CPHB, \u00b6 323.\n\nTr. 31:18-19.\n\n105.\n\nThe *rebus sic stantibus* principle has no application to this case.200 On the one hand, both the fact of the oil price increase and the magnitude of the increase were foreseeable. The negotiating history shows that the original parties to the PSC expressly contemplated the possibility that oil prices could increase, but ultimately decided not to include a price adjustment factor.201 Further, the magnitude of the oil price increase was not unprecedented, but was actually similar to that of the 1970s.202 On the other hand, the oil price increase did not render Ecuador's performance of the PSCs more burdensome.203 Thus, Ecuador does not meet the requirements *of the rebus sic stantibus* principle.204\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 386-391; CPHB, \u00b6 204.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 209-210.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 213.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 216.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 219.\n\n2. Burlington's Expropriation Claim\n-----------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nBurlington claims that Ecuador has expropriated its investment (2.1) in breach of the Treaty requirements for expropriation, *i.e.* unlawfully (2.2).\n\n2.1. Ecuador expropriated Burlington's investment\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador has deprived Burlington of the use and enjoyment of its investments by adopting the following measures which, both individually and in the aggregate, run afoul of Article III of the Treaty:\n\n(i) Enactment of Law 42 (at the 50% rate as of April 2006, and at the 99% rate as of October 2007);\n\n(ii) Seizure and auctioning \u2013 at below market prices \u2013 of the Consortium's share of crude oil production through the *coactiva* proceedings;\n\n(iii) Physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21;\n\n(iv) Termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 through the *caducidad* process.\n\n2.1.1. Law 42\n-------------\n\n108.\n\nBurlington claims that the application of Law 42 to its investment was an expropriatory measure. While Burlington agrees that the power to tax is part of a State's regulatory power, it observes that the sovereign power to tax might also entail the power to destroy. As Professor Ian Brownlie explained, a tax is unlawful when it has the \"precise object and effect of confiscation.\"205 The Treaty itself accepts the possibility that a tax may be expropriatory; thus, contrary to what Ecuador alleges, tax measures are not entitled to any special deference.206 Accordingly, a tax that substantially deprives an investor of the value of its investment is expropriatory.207 Whether a tax results in a substantial deprivation and is thus expropriatory is ultimately a fact-specific question.208\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 187.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 188.\n\nMem., \u00b6 441; CSM, \u00b6 82.\n\nCPHB, at \u00b6 189.\n\n109.\n\nLaw 42 was \"a measure tantamount to expropriation\".209 Its effect was to transfer virtually all of Burlington's revenues to Ecuador, and to deprive Burlington of practically all of the profits to which it was entitled under the PSCs. At the 50% rate, Law 42 had a devastating impact on Burlington's investment: Burlington was unable to recover past investments and forced to scale back its development plans, and operations in Block 21 became uneconomic.210 At the 99% rate, Law 42 had a destructive impact on Burlington's investment: Burlington operated at a loss in 2008 and ceased to make any new investment in the Blocks \u2013 even in the Oso field where it did make additional investments with Law 42 at 50%.211\n\nCSM, \u00b6 82.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 162-163, 165-168.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 173, 175-176.\n\n110.\n\nIn the words of counsel for Burlington, Law 42 at 99% transformed operations in the Blocks \"into a form of subsistence farming, hand-to-mouth, day-to-day operation.\"212 Law 42 at 99% diminished the Consortium's share of total revenues from 38.3% to 9.9% in Block 7, and from 48.6% to 8.3% in Block 21.213 In July 2008, for example, Napo crude had a market price of USD 122 per barrel. Under Law 42 at 99%, Burlington had to pay a Law 42 tax of over USD 107 per barrel.214 Therefore, according to Burlington, the evidence shows that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to expropriation both at the 50% and at the 99% rates.\n\nTr. 45:21-46:3.\n\nCOSS, ## 37 and 40 (\"Overview and Legal Framework\"); CPHB, \u00b6 312, pp. 180-181.\n\nMem., \u00b6 432.\n\n111.\n\nEcuador claims that under international law a tax is expropriatory only if (i) the State acts with expropriatory intent, and (ii) the tax is discriminatory. Yet, Burlington counters that there is no basis in the Treaty for these requirements. In any event, Burlington meets the requirements of expropriation even under Ecuador's own standard. In fact, as further elaborated below, the intent behind Law 42 was to deprive Burlington of its valuable rights under the PSCs. There was also a discriminatory application of the tax rates, because a lower tax rate of 70% applied to those oil companies who signed transitory agreements with Ecuador.\n\n112.\n\nContrary to what Ecuador argues, the purpose of Law 42 was *not* to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs.215 Had that been Ecuador's real intention, it would have conducted an analysis of each individual PSC in order to determine what the equilibrium point was. No such analysis was conducted. On the contrary, Ecuador imposed across the board tax rates that applied on a general basis and could thus not be tailored to the specificities of each individual PSC.216 In addition, Ecuador imposed three different tax rates at different points in time \u2013 50, 99 and 70 \u2013, thereby showing that its intent was not to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs.217\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 201.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 221.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 222-223.\n\n113.\n\nIn actuality, the purpose of Law 42 was to force Burlington to surrender its rights under the PSCs. President Correa himself characterized Law 42 as a \"pressuring measure\"218 that would prompt oil companies to negotiate with Ecuador.219 Likewise, President Correa stated that the oil companies had three options: to pay the Law 42 tax \u2013 at that point at the 99% rate \u2013, to renegotiate the PSC into a service contract, or else to receive the sunk costs of their investment and leave the country.220 Further evidence on record supports a similar conclusion. Accordingly, the purpose of Law 42 was to compel Burlington to relinquish its rights under the PSCs, not to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs.\n\nExh. C-182.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 28.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 231, 416.\n\n114.\n\nAfter passing Law 42, Ecuador had a contractual duty to apply the tax stabilization clauses under the PSCs. Pursuant to these clauses, Ecuador was bound to readjust Burlington's oil participation share in order to absorb the impact of the tax increase. However, Ecuador ignored Burlington's requests that its oil participation share be readjusted. This is consistent with Ecuador's goal of unilaterally changing the economic terms of the PSCs.221 By ignoring Burlington's request for a readjustment, Ecuador extinguished Burlington's rights to its participation share under the terms of the PSCs.222 As a result, Ecuador's enactment of Law 42 and its subsequent refusal to absorb the effects of this tax effected a taking of Burlington's contract rights.223\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 82.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 128-130.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 127.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, Ecuador wrongly seeks to create the impression that Burlington was an unreasonable partner. It is not true that Burlington failed to renegotiate the PSCs in good faith following the surge in oil prices. In reality, Burlington was unable to accept Ecuador's renegotiation proposals simply because they were unreasonable. These proposals required Burlington to forgo its rights under the PSCs without even knowing what it would receive in return.224 In addition, Ecuador's allegation that all other oil companies accepted to renegotiate their contracts is disingenuous.225 In fact, most initiated arbitration proceedings against Ecuador after Law 42 was passed, and only four out of the fourteen PSCs in force when Law 42 was enacted were successfully converted into service contracts.226\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 227.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 237.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 239-240, 244.\n\n2.1.2. The *coactiva* process, seizures and auctions\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nBurlington maintains that the *coactiva* process, seizures and auctions constituted a direct and complete taking because they had the effect of destroying the value of its investment.227 Ecuador carried out the *coactiva* process in breach of both the PSCs and this Tribunal's provisional measures order. Under the PSCs, a share of oil production had to be allocated to Burlington. Under the Tribunal's provisional measures order, Ecuador had to discontinue the *coactiva* process. Notwithstanding the PSCs and the provisional measures order, Ecuador continued to seize and auction Burlington's share of oil production.228\n\nCSM, \u00b6 88.\n\n*Id*.\n\n117.\n\nThe *coactiva* process was commenced in retaliation for Burlington's refusal to accept Ecuador's renegotiation proposals.229 In June 2008, the Consortium began making the disputed Law 42 payments into a segregated account. Ecuador raised no protest to this course of action for the next eight months.230 It was only after the renegotiation process broke down in December 2008 that Ecuador commenced the *coactiva* process.231 Ecuador had discretion to decide whether and when to start this process. Therefore, both the discretionary nature and the timing of the *coactiva* process show that it was initiated to retaliate against Burlington's opposition to surrender its rights under the PSCs.232\n\nCSM, \u00b6 87.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 247.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 93.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 90, 93.\n\n118.\n\nBurlington submits that the *coactiva* process was an expropriatory measure.233 As an initial matter, Burlington notes that the auction process was a failure because there were no bidders other than PetroEcuador. This allowed PetroEcuador to acquire the seized oil at discounts of 33% and 50% below market prices, harming Burlington in the process as the auctions resulted in reduced offsets of the alleged Law 42 debts.234 Moreover, by dint of the *coactiva* process, Burlington was deprived of the right to earn a revenue, and hence of the economic benefits of its investment.235 All in all, the *coactiva* process effected a \"complete taking\" because it destroyed the value of Burlington's investment.236\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 90-91.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 74; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 90-92.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 88.\n\n2.1.3. The physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nBurlington asserts that Ecuador's physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 completely expropriated its investment.237 This physical occupation was the culmination of Ecuador's chain of expropriatory measures. As a consequence of the *coactiva* process, Burlington's investment became uneconomic to the point where the Consortium had no rational choice other than to suspend operations in the Blocks.238 Using as a pretext the alleged risks that this suspension would bring about, Ecuador physically took over the Blocks. Accordingly, Ecuador's arbitrary takeover of the Blocks was a complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 93.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 96; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 71-73.\n\n120.\n\nBurlington's decision to suspend operations in Blocks 7 and 21 was justified both from an economic and a legal standpoint. From an economic standpoint, Burlington could not reasonably be expected to continue to fund an investment from which it no longer obtained any revenues.239 With the *coactiva* process, Burlington found itself in a position where it was liable for the entire costs and risks of oil production, but received no revenues in exchange.240 In those circumstances, Burlington had no rational course of action other than to suspend operations and to reduce costs to the minimum.241\n\nCSM, \u00b6 89.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 10.\n\nTr. 59:19-22.\n\n121.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, Burlington's suspension found justification in the principle of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*, by virtue of which a party to a contract may suspend performance in the event that the other party is in breach.242 Burlington could rely on this principle as a matter of both Ecuadorian and international law. Under Ecuadorian law, Burlington could invoke this principle because, contrary to what Ecuador alleges, hydrocarbons production is not a public service and thus there is no need to guarantee its continued operation.243 Under international law, ICSID tribunals have held that an investor may suspend operations when it would be unreasonable to continue operating in light of State measures.244\n\nTr. 64:17-65:14.\n\nTr. 1292:14-15.\n\nTr. 65:7-66:12; COSS, ## 61, 64 (\"Overview and Legal Framework\").\n\n122.\n\nAdditionally, Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks was not justified because there was no real risk of damage to the Blocks.245 The risks of damage on which Ecuador has focused are unsubstantiated and theoretical. They are unsubstantiated because the RPS study at the root of Ecuador's allegations is based on admittedly incomplete and partial information.246 They are theoretical because the RPS study draws no meaningful conclusions as to the likelihood that these risks may actually come to pass.247 As a matter of fact, Burlington's suspension plan was meant to follow a well-developed protocol, based on the experience of previous suspensions, which would have mitigated the risks identified in the RPS report.248\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 107.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 107.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 108-109.\n\n123.\n\nSince there was no proper justification for this measure, Ecuador's physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 was a complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment. The physical takeover of the Blocks was the last of a series of expropriatory measures prompted by Burlington's refusal to abandon its rights under the PSCs.249 It culminated Ecuador's campaign to migrate to a contract model more beneficial to the State in a period of high oil prices.250 Through this measure, Ecuador took possession of Burlington's entire investment.251\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 120.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 94.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 81 and 93.\n\n124.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ecuador's measures \u2013 namely, Law 42, the *coactiva* process, and the physical takeover of the Blocks \u2013 both individually and cumulatively expropriated Burlington's investment.\n\n2.1.4. The *caducidad* process\n------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nAccording to Burlington, the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 in the context of the *caducidad* process was merely \"symbolic\" because its investment had already been fully expropriated with the physical occupation of the Blocks.252 With this measure, Ecuador \"foreclosed any possibility of Burlington returning to the legal and fiscal regime it had been guaranteed prior to Ecuador's expropriation.\"253 For its part, Ecuador first submitted that \" *caducidad* is simply not part of this case\",254 and then raised jurisdictional and admissibility objections against the Tribunal entertaining *caducidad* -related claims. While Burlington has not specifically answered these submissions, it is apparent from its argumentation that it opposes them.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 80.\n\n*Id*.\n\nTr. 301:20-21\n\n2.2. Ecuador's expropriation of Burlington's investment was unlawful\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nEcuador's expropriation of Burlington's investment was unlawful because it failed to meet the requirements of Article III(1) of the BIT. First, under the BIT, compensation is an absolute requirement for a lawful expropriation. An expropriation cannot be lawful except upon payment of \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\"255 Therefore, Ecuador's failure to offer Burlington any compensation for the expropriation renders it unlawful. Second, Ecuador carried out the expropriation in contravention of the general principles of treatment articulated in Article II(3) of the Treaty \u2013 fair and equitable treatment, freedom from arbitrary measures and observance of obligations.256 The Tribunal has jurisdiction over these principles, which are expressly referred to in Article III(1)257 and are thus part of Burlington's expropriation claim.258\n\nExh. C-6, Article III(1); CSM, \u00b6\u00b6 99-101.\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 108-122.\n\n*Id*.,at \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 104-107, 121. Burlington specifically stated: \"Finding that the expropriation was carried out contrary to the principles articulated in Article II(3) does not depend on a stand-alone violation of Article II(3) and thus does not contravene this Tribunal's determination that it does not have jurisdiction under Article X to assess whether tax measures violated Article II(3) of the Treaty\" (*Id*., at \u00b6 106).\n\n**B. BURLINGTON'S REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nOn the basis of this position, Burlington requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n\"(a) DECLARE that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over Burlington's claims under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty;\n\n(b) DECLARE that Ecuador has breached:\n\n(i) Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty by failing to observe its obligations with regard to Burlington's investments; as well as\n\n(ii) Article III of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating Burlington's investments in Ecuador;\n\n(c) ORDER Ecuador to pay damages for its breaches of the Treaty, in an amount to be determined during the Quantum phase of these proceedings [\u2026] including payment of compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate until the effective and complete payment of the award of damages;\n\n(c) [sic] AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n\n(d) ORDER Ecuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Burlington's legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, and ICSID's other costs.\"259\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 137; CPHB, \u00b6339.\n\n**C. ECUADOR'S POSITION**\n-------------------------\n\n128.\n\nFollowing the Decision on Jurisdiction, Ecuador's case can essentially be summarized as follows:\n\n(i) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the (a) umbrella clause claims, (b) the fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment claims that Burlington seeks to reintroduce through the back door, and (c) any claim related to the *caducidad* decrees. In addition, any *caducidad* claim is inadmissible;\n\n(ii) Law 42 was necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. In particular, Law 42 did not modify or breach the PSCs and, at any rate, any alleged contract breach cannot amount to a Treaty breach;\n\n(iii) Ecuador did not expropriate Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21, whether (a) through Law 42, (b) the *coactiva* process, or (c) Ecuador's necessary intervention following Burlington's abandonment of the Blocks. At any rate, Ecuador did not unlawfully expropriate Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n1. Burlington Pursues Claims over which the Tribunal has no Jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nEcuador objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over Burlington's surviving umbrella clause claims, over Burlington's fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment claims, which Burlington is seeking to reintroduce \"through the back door\"260, and over the *caducidad* decrees. It adds that the *caducidad* claims are inadmissible.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 141, \u00a7 2.2.\n\n1.1. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's surviving umbrella clause claims\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nEcuador objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Burlington's surviving umbrella clause claims because (i) there is no \"obligation\" that could be elevated to the Treaty level, and (ii) if *par impossible* there were any such obligation, Burlington is not privy to it. The ordinary meaning of \"obligation\" involves a *ratione personae* element, a relationship between an obligee and an obligor, between a creditor and a debtor.261\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.\n\n131.\n\nHere there is no obligation that could be elevated to treaty level either in the PSCs or under the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law (\"EHL\"). There is none in the PSCs because the Burlington Subsidiaries withdrew the Contract Claims with prejudice. Therefore, Burlington has waived the rights underlying these claims and there is thus no corresponding obligation.262 In addition, Burlington may not invoke the EHL to elevate an \"obligation\" to treaty level because (i) Ecuador has not \"entered into\" any obligation in enacting the EHL, (ii) the EHL is of a general nature, and is not related to any specific investment, and (iii) at any rate, the EHL imposes no obligation upon Ecuador.263\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 48-97.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 99-112.\n\n132.\n\nMoreover, if there were nevertheless any \"obligations\" that could be elevated to treaty level, Burlington could not rely on them for lack of privity. The principle of privity is \"essential to contractual obligations.\"264 An obligation implies an obligor and an obligee, a creditor and a debtor. In short, privity is part of the ordinary meaning of the term \"obligation.\" The *CMS* annulment decision, other ICSID decisions, and commentators confirm this analysis. Burlington simply disregards the ordinary meaning of \"obligation\" and focuses on the expression \"with regard to investments\". However, this expression is intended to narrow the scope of the umbrella clause, not to broaden it.265\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 123.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 101, 113-137.\n\n1.2. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's *caducidad* claims (if any) nor over claims in relation to fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nEcuador also objects to the jurisdiction over and admissibility of the *caducidad* claims. As a preliminary matter, Ecuador understands that Burlington does not contest the validity of the *caducidad* decrees. Indeed, Burlington alleges that these decrees are of \"symbolic\" value and that the expropriation would in any event have occurred \"well before\" these decrees were issued. However, if Burlington does contest the validity of the *caducidad* decrees or the procedure leading up to them, then Ecuador objects to the jurisdiction over and admissibility of these claims.\n\n134.\n\nThe *caducidad* claims do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for several reasons. Initially, because the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 exclude *caducidad* from the scope of their arbitration clauses. In addition, because the PSCs also exclude Treaty claims from the *ratione materiae* scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction: that is what the parties to the PSCs intended, and the PSCs were concluded after the Treaty entered into force.266 Lastly, the *caducidad* claims are not admissible because Burlington has not made a reasonable attempt to pursue redress in relation to these measures before the Ecuadorian administrative courts.267\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 155-162.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 163-168.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, Ecuador also objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Burlington's already dismissed fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment claims. Although Article III(1) of the Treaty refers to Article II(3), Burlington abuses this reference to surreptitiously put before the Tribunal, once again, its fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment claims, over which the Tribunal has already held that it lacks jurisdiction. Thus, Ecuador requests that Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial on Liability (\u00b6\u00b6 102-122) be struck from the record.268\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 142-147.\n\n2. Ecuador Did not Breach its PSCs' Obligations Towards Burlington\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.1. Law 42 was necessary and appropriate under the circumstances\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nContrary to what Burlington alleges, Law 42 was not passed simply to capture a larger share of the revenues generated by increased oil prices. It was passed in a context marked by an unexpected and unprecedented increase in oil prices between 2002 and 2008. Neither Burlington nor Ecuador foresaw or could foresee this course of events. Such unprecedented price increase affected the economic equilibrium of the PSCs, which are based on the reasonably foreseeable expectations of the parties at the time of contract negotiations.269\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 171-183.\n\n137.\n\nWhen an unforeseen increase in prices affects the economics of the contract, the contract must be readjusted, taking into account the widely accepted assumption that the State, as the owner of the non renewable resource, is to be the main beneficiary of extra revenues resulting from high oil prices.270 Numerous other countries have acted just like Ecuador in similar circumstances. In 1980, the United States enacted an Oil Windfall Profit Tax in response to the oil price spike of the 1970s. And since 2002, no less than 16 countries, including developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, have adopted similar measures. Tellingly, ConocoPhillips, Burlington's parent company, has been subject to tax adjustments in the United Kingdom and Norway. Therefore, Burlington's portrayal of Ecuador as a \"renegade State\" is misguided.271\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 188.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 7, 190-194.\n\n138.\n\nThe PSCs were predicated upon economic models prepared by Engineer Celio Vega, Member of the Board of Directors of PetroEcuador and Financial Head of the Petroleum Contract Administration Unit.272 These models are mathematical formulas that take into account the economic variables of the contract at the time of contracting, such as the risk assumed by the investor and the reasonable income that the investor would make. One of the principal variables of these formulas was the oil market price. For Blocks 7 and 21, the market price taken into account at the time of contracting was US$ 15/bbl, and the projections of the reciprocal benefits for the investor and the State during the whole life of the contract was based on this price. At a market price of US$ 15/bbl, the investor could cover its expenses and obtain a reasonable return on its investment.273\n\nVega WS, \u00b6 9.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 195-200.\n\n139.\n\nThe unprecedented increase in oil prices affected the economic equilibrium on which the contract was based. While Ecuador initially attempted to redress this economic disequilibrium through negotiations, this attempt was unsuccessful. In point of fact, Burlington refused outright Ecuador's request for a fairer distribution of the oil production.274\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 201-208.\n\n140.\n\nAs a result, Ecuador sought to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs via the enactment of Law 42. The original proposals discussed were for a State participation of 80% of the extraordinary revenues. Eventually, Congress approved the bill with a State participation of 60%. However, President Palacio vetoed this bill and recommended that the formula \"at least 50%\" be used. With this modification, Law 42 was enacted on 19 April 2006. On 6 September 2006, the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court declared Law 42 constitutional.275\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 209-217.\n\n141.\n\nHowever, Law 42 proved to be insufficient to attain the equilibrium point. Therefore, in October 2007, a year and a half after Law 42 was passed, Decree 662 increased the State's participation in extraordinary revenues from 50% to 99%.276\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 220.\n\n142.\n\nTwo months later, Ecuador passed the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria* (\"LET\"), aimed to open a new avenue of negotiations with oil companies. Under the LET, the State's participation on extraordinary revenues would be 70%, and the reference price could be increased on a case-by-case basis. Except for Burlington and Perenco, all major companies operating in Ecuador took advantage of the LET. In April 2008, Ecuador announced that these transitory agreements would be in force for a maximum of a year before they would be migrated to service contracts. In the same month, on 21 April 2008, Burlington started arbitration proceedings against Ecuador.277\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 221-230.\n\n143.\n\nIn August 2008, Burlington revealed its plan to leave Ecuador. From that point on, Burlington blocked all of Ecuador's attempts to reach an agreement in relation to the PSCs. In fact, Perenco and PetroEcuador reached an agreement on terms that were fair and reasonable. However, Burlington, displaying both bad faith and a lack of a genuine intention to reach a negotiated solution, refused to accept this agreement. This was in marked contrast with Ecuador's attitude, which was always open to dialogue and willing to reach an amicable solution.278\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 235-250.\n\n2.2. Law 42 did not modify or breach the PSCs and, at any rate, any alleged contract breach cannot amount to a Treaty breach\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nEcuador advances the following six propositions. First, Law 42 did not modify the PSCs. Second, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs' clause ensuring Burlington a fixed participation in crude production. Third, Law 42 is not a \"royalty\" and thus Burlington has no right to be exempt from its application. Fourth, the renegotiation clauses have not been triggered nor breached. Fifth, clauses 3.1 and 22.1 of the PSCs are of no assistance to Burlington. Sixth and alternatively, if the Tribunal were to find that Ecuador somehow breached the PSCs, these contract breaches could not amount to a Treaty breach.279\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 255-260.\n\n145.\n\nFirst, Law 42 did not modify the PSCs. Law 42 deals only with oil prices. The PSCs, in turn, deal only with oil volumes and contain no provisions on oil prices. Thus, Law 42 simply cannot modify the PSCs. This is the conclusion which the Constitutional Court of Ecuador also reached. The Constitutional Court ruled that Law 42 did not modify the PSCs.280\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6\u00b6 268-272\n\n146.\n\nSecond, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs' clause ensuring Burlington a fixed participation in crude production. It is undisputed that Law 42 did not hinder Burlington's right to dispose of its share of crude production. However, Burlington self-servingly reads into this clause a right to not be subject to any measures the effect of which would be to reduce its revenues. Yet, if Burlington had this right \u2013 it does not \u2013 there would be no purpose in the renegotiation clauses, which apply precisely when there is a modification of the tax regime.\n\n147.\n\nThird, and although it appears that Burlington has abandoned this argument following the Decision on Jurisdiction, Law 42 is not a \"royalty\" and thus Burlington has no right to be exempt from its application. Law 42 is not a royalty because it is part of Article 55 of the EHL, not of Article 54, where royalties are mentioned, and because, if it were a royalty, there would have been no need to amend Article 44 of the EHL, which already included the term royalties. Moreover, Law 42 does not have the characteristics of a royalty. It is a levy and, as such, is governed by the renegotiation clauses.281\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 304-315.\n\n148.\n\nFourth, the renegotiation clauses have been neither triggered nor breached by the application of Law 42. Indeed, Law 42 had no \"impact on the economy\" of the PSCs, which is an indispensable requirement for the application of these clauses. The \"economy\" of a PSC, under Ecuadorian law, is determined \" as of the date it was executed \"282 (emphasis in the original). At that time, the Parties agreed to use the economic model prepared by Eng. Celio Vega (the \"Vega Model\"). Amid other variables, the Vega Model included a constant oil price of US$ 15/bbl for the entire life of the PSCs. Yet, crucially, Law 42 applied only to oil prices higher than the US$ 15/bbl mark upon which the Vega Model was predicated. Thus, Law 42 did not impact the economy of the PSCs.283\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 329.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 320-343.\n\n149.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Tribunal found that Law 42 did affect the economy of the PSCs, Ecuador has not breached the renegotiation clauses because \"an obligation to negotiate does not imply an obligation to reach an agreement.\"284 Ecuador was always available to negotiate with Burlington; if no agreement was reached, it was due to Burlington. Moreover, this Tribunal does not have the power to rewrite the terms of the PSCs in case the Parties failed to negotiate or to reach an agreement. It would not even have jurisdiction to do so, because this would not be a \"legal\" dispute under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.285\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 349; Exh. EL-102, at 116.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 344-363.\n\n150.\n\nFifth, Clauses 3.1 and 22.1 of the PSCs are of no assistance to Burlington. These are not stabilization clauses. Clause 3.1 merely incorporates the principle of *pacta sunt servanda.* Law 42 does not affect this principle because it addresses a matter \u2013 extraordinary revenues \u2013 which was not regulated in the PSCs. Nor is Clause 22.1 a stabilization clause because (i) it does not expressly exclude the application of future laws and regulations; (ii) it is a mere rule of contract interpretation which does not preclude the application of subsequent laws and regulations; (iii) it operates as a choice of law provision; (iv) other clauses in the PSCs fail to distinguish between laws enacted before the entry into force of the PSCs and thereafter; (v) otherwise the renegotiation clauses would serve no purpose.286\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 365-376.\n\n151.\n\nSixth and alternatively, if the Tribunal found that Ecuador somehow breached the PSCs, these purported contract breaches could not amount to a treaty breach. As explained by the *Vivendi ad hoc* annulment Committee, not every breach of contract amounts to a breach of treaty.287 A contract breach amounts to a treaty breach if there is an \"effective repudiation of the right [...] which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent.\"288\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 386-388.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 388.\n\n3. Ecuador did not expropriate Burlington's investment\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1. Law 42 did not expropriate Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nBurlington's expropriation claim does not stand. As a threshold matter, Burlington bears a high burden of proof. Since Burlington is challenging a tax measure, it must prove, in accordance with *EnCana*, that Law 42 was \"extraordinary, punitive in amount or arbitrary in its incidence\",289 and that its effects amount to expropriation of its investment. Burlington has failed to establish that these elements are met.290\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 397\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 394-398.\n\n153.\n\nIn any event, Law 42 (i) was a legitimate and *bona fide* exercise of its sovereign tax powers, and (ii) it did not expropriate Burlington's investment.291\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 399.\n\n154.\n\nFirst, Law 42 was a legitimate and *bona fide* exercise of Ecuador's tax powers. Under international law, legitimate and *bona fide* State regulatory measures, such as Law 42, do not constitute expropriation and, consequently, are non compensable. Specifically, Law 42 must be presumed to be a valid measure not entitling Burlington to compensation unless proven otherwise. To rebut this presumption, Burlington must show with clear and convincing evidence that Ecuador's exercise of its sovereign power was illegitimate or abusive. However, Burlington has made no such showing.292\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 400-437.\n\n155.\n\nLaw 42 was a legitimate and *bona fide* exercise of Ecuador's tax power because its goal was to remedy the imbalance caused by the massive and unforeseen increase in oil prices. As a result of this imbalance, Burlington had an obligation to renegotiate the PSCs in good faith and Ecuador had a duty to legislate to obtain a fair allocation of oil revenues. Nevertheless, Burlington \"obstinately refused\" to renegotiate the PSCs.293 In view of the failed renegotiations, Ecuador was under a constitutional mandate to seek a fair allocation of the revenues derived from its hydrocarbons. Law 42 was an appropriate means of furthering that mandate.294\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 449.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 440-460.\n\n156.\n\nSecond, even if the Tribunal were to find that Law 42 is an illegitimate regulatory measure, Law 42 did not expropriate Burlington's investment. Law 42 has not expropriated Burlington's investment, whether directly or indirectly. Law 42 did not directly expropriate Burlington's investment because it did not physically seize Burlington's investment, nor did it revoke, cancel or repudiate Burlington's rights under the PSCs.295 Likewise, Law 42 did not indirectly expropriate Burlington's investment. There is an indirect expropriation when the effects of the challenged measure are equivalent to a taking. In particular, the investor must show that the challenged measure caused a total and permanent loss of value or control of the investment. Burlington has shown neither.296\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 464-469.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 464-477.\n\n157.\n\nBurlington has failed to show that Law 42 at 50% expropriated its investment. The following evidence in fact proves that there was no expropriation: (i) the Consortium's tax reports show that, even with the Law 42 payments, 2006 and 2007 were more profitable than 2005; (ii) the Fair Links expert report concludes that Burlington's operations were not \"uneconomic\" as alleged by Burlington; (iii) the Consortium submitted an amended plan for additional developments in Block 7, demonstrating that, even with the Law 42 payments, it made economic sense to invest additional capital (the \"Oso Development Plan\"); (iv) ConocoPhillip's annual reports for the years 20062008 show no losses in Ecuador.\n\n158.\n\nIn addition, as previously demonstrated, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs. Hence, there can be no expropriation, since Burlington claims precisely the value of its rights under the PSCs. Finally, Law 42 cannot constitute expropriation because it does not cause a *permanent* deprivation of Burlington's investment: it applies if and only if the market price of Ecuadorian crude exceeds the reference price. In fact, contrary to the impression that Burlington seeks to create, oil market prices have not always been above the reference price, *e.g.* January and February 2009. In sum, Law 42 at the 50% rate did not expropriate Burlington's investment.297\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 478-507.\n\n159.\n\nSimilarly, Law 42 at the 99% rate did not expropriate Burlington's investment. Law 42 at the 50% rate was insufficient to induce oil companies operating in Ecuador to negotiate a new contractual framework. Decree 662, which increased the rate to 99%, had the effect of prompting companies to sign new service contracts, with the exception of Burlington and Perenco298. Burlington has submitted no evidence that Law 42 at 99% deprived its investment of value. In actuality, Law 42 at 99% did not produce effects tantamount to expropriation, as shown by the same facts as those referred in connection with Law 42 at 50%.299 In particular, Fair Links concluded that Decree 662 \"did not alter the global trend of positive cash flows.\"300\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 511-512.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 508-529.\n\nFair Links ER, \u00b6 94; RCM, \u00b6 517.\n\n3.2. Ecuador's enforcement of Law 42 through the *coactiva* process was not an expropriatory measure under Article III of the Treaty\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nContrary to Burlington's allegations, the *coactiva* process did not constitute an expropriation. Ecuador resorted to the *coactiva* process to enforce its laws and in doing so, it did not expropriate Burlington's investment.\n\n161.\n\nPetroEcuador is an agency authorized to use the *coactiva*, a process whereby an administrative agency may enforce obligations without the need for an order or authorization from State courts. In particular, PetroEcuador was entitled to collect Law 42 payments. In the *coactiva* process, if the debtor does not pay his debt after being notified on two occasions, his assets are seized and eventually auctioned off. In the first auction round, offers may not be lower than two thirds of the appraised value of the asset. If no bids are submitted during the first round, a second round is convened, at which offers may not be lower than 50% of the appraised value of the auctioned asset.301\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 532-540.\n\n162.\n\nThe *coactiva* process did not expropriate Burlington's investment. Burlington seeks to create the appearance that PetroEcuador benefitted from the auction process by acquiring the Consortium's oil at a \"steep discount.\" However, PetroEcuador simply purchased the seized production at the discounts authorized under Ecuadorian law. Moreover, it was only in the first auction that PetroEcuador waited until the second round to present its offer, for it was unaware that no other company would take part in the auctions. After the first auction, PetroEcuador always submitted its bids during the first round, offering a price slightly above the minimum authorized by law. Other companies were dissuaded from participating in these auctions because the Consortium threatened to take legal action against any prospective buyer of the seized crude.302\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 541-552.\n\n163.\n\nFurther, the *coactiva* process did not constitute a direct expropriation of Burlington's investment because Ecuador did not intend to deprive Burlington of its investment but merely to enforce a legitimate credit. In any event, the effect of this process was neutral since, as recognized by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 1, every time oil was seized, previous Law 42 payments were extinguished. Finally, Burlington fails to explain how Ecuador's non-compliance with the Tribunal's recommendation in Provisional Order No. 1 can be deemed an expropriation.303\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 553-559.\n\n3.3. Ecuador's intervention following Burlington's abandonment of Blocks 7 and 21 in July 2009 neither completed the alleged expropriation nor effected a direct expropriation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nEcuador's intervention in Blocks 7 and 21 did not constitute an expropriation of Burlington's investment. It was provoked by Burlington's unilateral decision to suspend operations and aimed at preventing significant harm to the Blocks. Hence, Ecuador's intervention was necessary, adequate, proportionate under the circumstances, and meant to be temporary.304 Ultimately, Burlington's decision to suspend operations was a \"calculated act\" intended to force Ecuador to act in order to avoid damage to the Blocks.305\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 560-561.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 565.\n\n165.\n\nBurlington adopted active steps to suspend operations in the Blocks even though (i) this course of action was not economically justified, as Burlington had the financial resources to continue operating the Blocks, *e.g.* the Law 42 payments made into the segregated bank account; (ii) the suspension would have resulted in the breach of both the PSCs and Ecuadorian law; and (iii) the suspension would have caused significant economic loss and serious damage to the Blocks. As part of its self-expropriation strategy, Burlington knew that this would prompt Ecuador to act in order to prevent damage to the Blocks.306\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 562-565.\n\n166.\n\nBurlington announced that the suspension would take place at noon on 16 July 2009. Ecuador, in turn, indicated that, if the Consortium suspended operations, It would take appropriate measures to prevent the suspension. On 16 July 2009, Ecuadorian government officials entered the Blocks at 2:00 PM. Contrary to what Burlington has alleged, the entry was amicable, not by force. In fact, the Blocks were still in operation at that time because the Consortium's employees had decided to ignore Perenco's instructions. Furthermore, on the same day, PetroEcuador issued a Resolution declaring the state of emergency in the Blocks and authorizing PetroAmazonas \u2013 PetroEcuador's subsidiary \u2013 to adopt the necessary measures to ensure the continuity of operations.307\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 566-580.\n\n167.\n\nBurlington's decision to unilaterally suspend operations in the Blocks was not economically justified. Burlington had the funds necessary to continue operating the Blocks, as shown by the Law 42 payments it had made into a segregated off-shore account. After the enactment of Law 42 and Decree 662, it had also made minimum investments in the Blocks and, if the seized oil was auctioned at below market prices, this was due to the Consortium's active hostility against potential bidders.308\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 589-595.\n\n168.\n\nBurlington's unilateral suspension of operations was in breach of Ecuadorian law and of the PSCs. Under the Ecuadorian Constitution, suspension of public services, which expressly include \"hydrocarbon production\", is forbidden. In addition, Burlington had no justification to suspend operations because the principle *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* finds almost no application under Ecuadorian administrative law. Accordingly, Burlington was bound to perform its obligations despite any alleged breach on Ecuador's part.309\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 596-606.\n\n169.\n\nEcuador intervened in the Blocks to enforce its laws within its police powers and to avoid the significant economic loss and damage to the Blocks that the Consortium's unilateral suspension of operations would have caused. Barring intervention, the Consortium's abandonment of the Blocks would have caused reservoir, mechanical and environmental damage to the Blocks, and significant economic loss to the State. Burlington suspended operations only to induce Ecuador to intervene in the Blocks, in furtherance of its self-expropriation strategy.310\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 620.\n\n170.\n\nEcuador's intervention in the Blocks was appropriate. Burlington was duly informed of the consequences that the suspension of operations would carry, whereas Ecuador entered the Blocks amicably and expressly assured Burlington that its rights under the PSCs would remain unaffected.311 Ecuador's intervention was a means proportionate to the goal of avoiding damage to the Blocks.312 Finally, expropriation requires permanent deprivation. This requirement is not met in this case because Ecuador's intervention was a temporary measure meant to cease once the Consortium resumed operations.313\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 654-657.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 658-661.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 662-665.\n\n3.4. In any event, Ecuador did not unlawfully expropriate Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal were nevertheless to conclude that the measures discussed in the previous sections constituted an expropriation of Burlington's investment, such expropriation was a lawful one. Ecuador submits that the failure to pay compensation pursuant to Article III(1) of the Treaty does not render the expropriation unlawful if the expropriation is disputed. Moreover, the expropriation was not unfair and inequitable, arbitrary or in contravention of Ecuador's obligations to Burlington.314\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 667-675.\n\n172.\n\nFirst, Ecuador's failure to compensate Burlington does not render the expropriation unlawful, because the expropriation is disputed. The expropriation must occur *before* compensation is offered. This case is first and foremost about whether *there is expropriation* in the first place. Compensation becomes a relevant question only after it is established that there is expropriation. Were it otherwise, every single case of indirect expropriation would almost invariably become a case of unlawful expropriation.315\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 676-697.\n\n173.\n\nSecond, had there been expropriation, it was not unfair and inequitable because Law 42 sought to restore the \"economy\" of the PSCs. Law 42 was a *bona fide*, legitimate exercise of Ecuador's sovereign tax powers, which did not cause Burlington to surrender any right under the PSCs. In addition, the alleged expropriation would not have been arbitrary because Ecuador has submitted itself to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, never interfering with its authority; nor were the *coactiva* measures arbitrary for they merely enforced Ecuador's Law 42 tax. Finally, the expropriation would not have been in breach of Ecuador's obligations as the PSCs were neither modified nor breached.316\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 698-721.\n\n**D. ECUADOR'S REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nOn the basis of this position, Ecuador requests the Tribunal to render an award:\n\n\" **10.1 Declaring**\n\n**10.1.1 On jurisdiction**\n\n793. that it lacks jurisdiction over Burlington's (i) Law 42 first umbrella clause claim and (ii) the first limb of its third umbrella clause claim under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty as defined in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction;\n\n794. that, to the extent that Burlington seeks to reintroduce its Law 42 fair and equitable treatment claim and Law 42 arbitrary impairment of the investment claim, Section III(B)(2), paragraphs 102 to 122, pages 56 to 68 of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial are struck off the record;\n\n795. that it lacks jurisdiction over Burlington's claims regarding the *Caducidad* decrees and all matters related thereto;\n\n**10.1.2 On admissibility**\n\n796. alternatively, that Burlington's claims regarding the *Caducidad* decrees and all matters related thereto are inadmissible;\n\n**10.1.3 On liability**\n\n797. that Law 42 did not modify the Participation Contracts and all of Burlington's claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n798. that Ecuador's enactment of Law 42 did not breach the Participation Contracts and all of Burlington's claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n799. that the Renegotiation Clauses were not triggered nor breached by Ecuador's enactment of Law 42 and all of Burlington's claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n800. that, given that the Participation Contracts have not been breached, the Treaty has not been breached either and all of Burlington's Treaty claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n801. alternatively to the finding on jurisdiction requested above, that Ecuador has not breached the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty and all of Burlington's claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n802. that Law 42 was a legitimate and *bona fide* exercise by Ecuador of its sovereign taxation powers;\n\n803. that Ecuador's enactment of Law 42 does not amount to an expropriation under Article III of the Treaty and all of Burlington's claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n804. that Ecuador's institution of the *coactiva* procedures does not amount to an expropriation under Article III of the Treaty and all of Burlington's claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n805 that Ecuador's assumption of operations in Blocks 7 and 21 does not amount to an expropriation under Article III of the Treaty and all of Burlington's claims related thereto are therefore dismissed;\n\n806. that, in any event, the measures in dispute do not amount to an unlawful expropriation under Article III of the Treaty;\n\n807. that Burlington is liable towards Ecuador for the costs of remedying the environmental damages in areas within Blocks 7 and 21 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region; and\n\n808. that Burlington is liable towards Ecuador for the costs required to bring back the infrastructure of Blocks 7 and 21 into good working condition in accordance with the best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbons industry.\n\n**10.2 Ordering**\n\n809. Burlington to bear the full costs of the remaining environmental studies for Blocks 7 and 21;\n\n810. Burlington to remedy any and all environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21 or pay the full costs of remedying the environmental damage, in an amount to be determined in the Quantum phase of this arbitration;\n\n811. Burlington to pay damages for its breaches of the Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 and Ecuadorian law in an amount to be determined in the Quantum phase of this arbitration;\n\n812. Burlington to pay all the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Ecuador's legal and experts fees and ICSID's other costs; and\n\n813. Burlington to pay compound interest at an adequate commercial interest rate on the amounts stated in the two preceding paragraphs from the date of disbursement thereof until the date of full payment.\n\n**10.3 Award**\n\n814. Such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.\"317\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 793-814. In RPHB, \u00b6 589, the Respondent incorporated these requests for relief.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has deliberated and considered the Parties' written and oral submissions and arguments. To the extent that these arguments have not been referred to expressly, they must be deemed to be subsumed in the analysis. This analysis addresses Ecuador's outstanding jurisdictional and admissibility defenses and Burlington's Treaty claims on the merits.318 If Ecuador is found liable to Burlington, a quantum phase will be held at a later stage of the proceedings. In parallel to Burlington's claims, this arbitration will also deal with Ecuador's counterclaims.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that it has jurisdiction over Burlington's expropriation claims, but must still ascertain whether it has jurisdiction over the umbrella clause claims (DJ, \u00b6 342).\n\n176.\n\nAt the outset of the analysis, the Tribunal will consider some preliminary matters, including the law applicable to the merits and the relevance of previous decisions of international courts and tribunals (A); subsequently, it will examine Ecuador's outstanding jurisdictional and admissibility objections (B) and Burlington's claims on the merits (C). Finally, the Tribunal will set forth its decision (Section V).\n\nA. **PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n1. Law Applicable to the Merits\n-------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nBurlington's claims are based upon the United States - Ecuador BIT, which is thus the primary source of law for this Tribunal. With respect to matters not covered by the BIT, the latter contains no choice of law. The Tribunal must thus resort to Article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that:\n\n\"(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n178.\n\nExcept for the undisputed application of the BIT, the Parties to this dispute have not agreed on the rules of law that govern the merits of this dispute in the sense of Article 42(1), first sentence. Therefore, according to the second sentence of Article 42(1), the Tribunal must \"apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute [...] and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" Indeed, the Parties have made their submissions under the correct assumption that both Ecuadorian law and international law govern the merits of this dispute.\n\n179.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal will apply (i) first and foremost the BIT and, if need be, (ii) Ecuadorian law and those rules of international law \"as may be applicable\". In this latter respect, the Tribunal is of the view that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is thus for the arbitrators to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law. In this context, it should be noted that the PSCs include a choice of Ecuadorian law.319 It should further be noted that a party may not rely on its internal law to avoid an obligation under international law.\n\nClause 22.1 of the PSC for Block 7 provides that \"[t]his Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and laws in force at the time of its signature are understood to be incorporated by reference\" (Exh. C-1). Likewise, clause 22.1 of the PSC for Block 21 sets forth that \"[t]his Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and laws in force at the time of its signature are understood to be incorporated by reference\" (Exh. C-2).\n\n2. Ecuador's Request that Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial on Liability be Struck From the Record\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nEcuador requests that Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial on Liability be struck from the record on the ground that it reintroduces, under the guise of its surviving expropriation claim, the fair and equitable treatment and arbitrary impairment claims over which the Tribunal has already ruled that it has no jurisdiction. Ecuador argues that, whereas Article III(1) of the Treaty undoubtedly refers to the principles of treatment of Article II(3), Burlington improperly relies on this reference to establish that there was expropriation. However, the principles of treatment of Article II(3) of the Treaty only become relevant once it has been established that there was expropriation to begin with.320\n\nTr. 210:2-213:7. In particular, Ecuador's assertion that \"realizing that it's not easy for [Burlington] to characterize Law 42 as an expropriation, they in fact rely on Article II [of the Treaty] to characterize it as an expropriation, and that they cannot do. The Treaty does not permit that\" (Tr. 213:3-7).\n\n181.\n\nArticle III(1) of the Treaty provides that \" *investments shall not be expropriated except*\n\n*[...] in accordance with the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3).\"*\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that this provision is only triggered if it is established that there is an expropriation. If there is an expropriation, it must be effected in accordance with the principles of treatment spelled out in Article II(3) of the Treaty. If there is no expropriation, this provision is inapposite.\n\n182.\n\nBurlington's submissions do not suggest a different interpretation of this provision. In the Tribunal's understanding, Burlington relies on the principles of treatment of Article II(3) of the Treaty merely to establish that the purported expropriation of its investment was effected unlawfully:\n\n\" Article X of the Treaty and this Tribunal's ruling in its Decision on Jurisdiction do not affect the applicability of the principles of Article II(3) to assess the lawfulness of Ecuador's measures as an expropriation under Article III. This Tribunal has jurisdiction over Burlington's Article III expropriation claim under Article X of the Treaty. As a result, once it finds that an expropriation has occurred, it has jurisdiction to assess the lawfulness of the expropriation by determining whether, as Article III(1) requires, the expropriation was consistent with the principles of treatment enunciated in Article II(3). Finding that the expropriation was carried out contrary to principles articulated in Article II(3) does not depend on a stand-alone violation of Article II(3) and thus does not contravene this Tribunal's determination that it does not have jurisdiction under Article X to assess whether tax measures violated Article II(3) of the Treaty.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn sum, Ecuador has expropriated Burlington's investments through means contrary to the principles of fair and equitable treatment, the obligation not to impair investment through arbitrary treatment and the duty to observe obligations. Ecuador has offered no compensation whatsoever for its unlawful expropriation. Ecuador is therefore liable under the *Ch\u00f3rzow* standard for an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Treaty and in violation of general principles of international law.\"321 (emphasis added).\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 106, 122.\n\n183.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal sees no reason to strike Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial on Liability from the record.\n\n3. Undisputed Matters\n---------------------\n\n184.\n\nMost of the facts of this case are not in dispute. At the hearing, counsel for the Claimant noted that this \"case [...] is relatively simple on the facts because[,] for the most part, the facts are not in dispute.\"322 While there are a few disputed issues of fact, the Claimant and the Respondent agree on most of the facts that gave rise to this dispute \u2013 their disagreement being, at its core, about how the petroleum rent should be allocated between them.\n\nTr. 14:4-6.\n\n185.\n\nIn particular, the Parties do not dispute that (i) beginning in 2002, oil prices rose well above the prevailing oil price at the time when the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 were executed; (ii) in November 2005, Ecuador sought to renegotiate the PSCs with Burlington (and its partner Perenco) for the first time; (iii) after those renegotiations failed, Ecuador passed sequentially Law 42 in April 2006, Decree 662 in October 2007, and the LET in December 2007; (iv) Burlington made Law 42 payments to Ecuador under protest from the time they were first imposed in mid-2006 until May 2008; (v) in June 2008, Burlington stopped making Law 42 payments to Ecuador, and instead began making Law 42 payments into a segregated account located in the United States.\n\n186.\n\nIt is further common ground that, following a new round of failed renegotiations in 2008, (vi) Ecuador initiated *coactiva* proceedings against Burlington in February 2009 and began to seize Burlington's share of oil production the following month; (vii) from March 2009 to around mid-2010, PetroEcuador auctioned and, being the sole bidder, acquired Burlington's share of oil production at below market prices in the context of the *coactiva* proceedings; (viii) on 16 July 2009, Burlington and Perenco ceased to operate Blocks 7 and 21; (ix) on that same day, Ecuador took possession of Blocks 7 and 21; (x) in July 2010, Ecuador terminated the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 pursuant to the so-called *caducidad* process.\n\n4. Relevance of Decisions of Other International Courts and Tribunals\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nAs stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. Nevertheless, the majority considers that it must pay due regard to earlier decisions of international courts and tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards the certainty of the rule of law. Arbitrator Stern does not analyze the arbitrator's role in the same manner, as she considers it her duty to decide each case on its own merits, independently of any apparent jurisprudential trend.\n\n**B. JURISDICTIONAL AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Does the Tribunal Have Jurisdiction over Burlington's Umbrella Clause Claims under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal joined to the merits \"the determination of whether it has jurisdiction over Burlington's Law 42 first umbrella clause claim and over the first limb of its third umbrella clause claim under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty\"323 (the \"umbrella clause claims\"). It did so, on the ground that the Parties had not sufficiently discussed Ecuador's lack of privity objection, which had been raised for the first time at the hearing on jurisdiction324. As the Parties have since then argued this point at length, the issue is now ripe for the Tribunal's determination.\n\nDJ, \u00b6 342 (B).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 197.\n\n189.\n\nEcuador maintains that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's umbrella clause claims for the following three reasons: (i) by withdrawing the Contract Claims \"with prejudice\", Burlington waived its rights under the PSCs and thus the umbrella clause has no object; (ii) Burlington has no independent rights deriving from the so-called Hydrocarbons Legal Framework; and (iii) contrary to what the Treaty requires, there is no privity of contract between Burlington and Ecuador. The Tribunal will address Ecuador's objections sequentially.\n\n1.1. Is the umbrella clause without \"object\" as a result of the withdrawal of the Contract Claims with prejudice?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.1.1. Positions of the Parties\n-------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nEcuador alleges that the Treaty's umbrella clause is of no avail to Burlington because there is no surviving contractual obligation that could be elevated to the Treaty level via the umbrella clause. In point of fact, the Burlington Subsidiaries withdrew their contract claims against Ecuador \"with prejudice.\"325 This amounts to a waiver of all underlying rights and obligations under the PSCs. Support for this conclusion is to be found in decisions by ICSID tribunals in *Cementownia v. Republic of Turkey* (*Cementownia*)326 and *Waste Management v. United Mexican States* (*Waste Management II*).327 Hence, Burlington may not elevate extinct contractual obligations to the Treaty level through the umbrella clause.328 This argument is submitted as a jurisdictional objection or, alternatively, as a defense on the merits. In addition, Ecuador assumed no independent obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Burlington under the Hydrocarbons Law.329 For these reasons, the Treaty's umbrella clause has \"no object.\"330\n\nLetter from Burlington and the Burlington Subsidiaries to the Tribunal dated 10 October 2009; Exh. C-190.\n\n*Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey* (hereinafter \" *Cementownia* \"), Award of 17 September 2009 (Exh. EL-66).\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, (hereinafter \" *Waste Management II* \"), Award of 30 April 2004 (Exh. EL-67).\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 30-98.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 99-112.\n\nTr. 191:20 and 1326:8.\n\n191.\n\nBurlington argues that the Tribunal already dismissed this objection in its Decision on Jurisdiction.331 In any event, Ecuador's objection is flawed insofar as Contract and Treaty Claims have \"separate lives.\"332 Once the PSCs were breached, two sets of claims arose: a set of Contract Claims and a set of Treaty Claims. It is entirely possible to pursue one set of claims without pursuing the other. These independent sets of claims involve different Parties \u2013 Burlington Resources as opposed to Burlington Oriente \u2013 and different sources of rights \u2013 the Treaty as opposed to the PSCs.333 Moreover, Ecuador also assumed obligations towards Burlington through the specific regulatory regime embodied in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework.334\n\nTr. 151:19-21.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 262.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 260-262; Tr. 152:4-10.\n\nTr. 1295:3-16.\n\n1.1.2. Analysis\n---------------\n\n192.\n\nIn its submissions on the merits, Ecuador raised the argument of the waiver of the contract rights. To the extent that it deals with jurisdiction, this objection would be barred because the jurisdictional phase was closed but for the privity issue. Indeed, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that \"the Parties may not re-argue or present new arguments on any jurisdictional issue other than the privity objection with respect to Burlington's outstanding umbrella clause claims.\"335\n\nDJ, \u00b6 199.\n\n193.\n\nBe this as it may, Ecuador has also submitted this argument as one on the merits. At the hearing on liability, counsel for Ecuador stated: \"[I]f the Tribunal was to decide that this is not an admissible jurisdictional objection at this stage, we deal with it as a defense on the merits [\u2026].\"336 As a defense on the merits, Ecuador's argument is not precluded by the terms of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction. It raises an issue that bears an obvious connection to the merits, to wit, whether Burlington has any umbrella clause rights at all. Hence, the Tribunal will entertain Ecuador's new argument as a defense on the merits.\n\nTr. 189:11-14. Counsel for Ecuador also pointed out: \"Where does the Umbrella Clause stand in that context [of substantive and jurisdictional clauses]? They [umbrella clauses] can reasonably achieve two objectives, and that's reflected in Mr. Vandevelde's commentary which both Jan Paulsson and I mentioned in the opening.\" (Tr. 1336:22-1337:4).\n\n194.\n\nEcuador's defense is based on the premise that a withdrawal of claims with prejudice results in a waiver of the rights underlying those claims. In this way, the Burlington Subsidiaries' withdrawal of their contract claims with prejudice waived the underlying contractual rights. Ecuador finds support for this argument in two ICSID decisions: *Cementownia* and *Waste Management II*. In *Cementownia*, the tribunal quoted the following passage from the *Waste Management II* decision:\n\n\"In international litigation the withdrawal of a claim does not, *unless otherwise agreed*, amount to a waiver of any underlying rights of the withdrawing party.\"337 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. EL-141, \u00b6 36; *Cementownia* Award, at \u00b6 109 (Exh. EL-66)..\n\n195.\n\nOn the basis of *Cementownia* and *Waste Management II*, Ecuador argues that a withdrawal with prejudice amounts to an agreement to waive the rights underlying those claims. Applied to this case, the withdrawal of the Contract Claims with prejudice would be the equivalent of a waiver of the underlying rights. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument for the following reasons.\n\n196.\n\nFirst, it arises from the two cases referred to by Ecuador that the rule is that a withdrawal of claims does not amount to a waiver of rights. It further arises that as an exception to the rule, the parties may agree otherwise, in which case the withdrawal of claims operates as a waiver of substantive rights. Albeit not directly applicable to the withdrawal of claims in this arbitration, Ecuadorian procedural law seems to apply the same rule. Specifically, Article 377 of the Ecuadorian Code of Civil Procedure provides that the party who withdraws a claim \"cannot re-file\" this claim against the same person or against its legal representative.\n\n197.\n\nThus, the question here is whether the Tribunal should apply the exception rather than the rule, that is whether the Parties intended the withdrawal of the Subsidiaries' Claims to operate as a waiver of the underlying substantive rights. The evidence on record suggests the contrary. By letter of 10 October 2009, counsel for the Initial Claimants confirmed that the Burlington Subsidiaries would withdraw their contract claims \"with prejudice\" because they saw \"no reason to preserve [their] right to re-file the contractual claims in the future.\"338 In other words, the avowed purpose of the withdrawal with prejudice was to renounce the possibility to \"re-file the contractual claims in the future,\"339 it was not to waive contractual rights for purposes of this proceeding. Therefore, no intent to waive the contract rights may be inferred from the letter of 10 October 2009 confirming the withdrawal with prejudice.\n\nExh. C-190, p. 2.\n\n*Id.*\n\n198.\n\nMore generally, Burlington's continuing prosecution of the umbrella claim under the Treaty belies an intent by its Subsidiaries to waive their rights under the PSCs. As counsel for the Claimant stressed at the hearing, Burlington's umbrella clause claims were \"present from the beginning of this arbitration and were never waived.\"340 The Treaty's umbrella clause can only become operative if underlying rights arising from another source do exist. Considering that the umbrella clause claim was pending at the time of withdrawal of the Subsidiaries' claims, one cannot understand the Burlington Subsidiaries to have intended to waive the very rights on which Burlington's umbrella clause claim was predicated.\n\nTr. 1294:2-6.\n\n199.\n\nIn sum, the Burlington Subsidiaries have waived the possibility of ever re-filing their claims under the PSCs in any form in the future. They have not waived the underlying rights and Burlington may thus rely on these underlying rights to pursue its Treaty claims in this arbitration.\n\n1.2. May Burlington rely on the Treaty's umbrella clause to enforce its purported rights under the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.2.1. Positions of the Parties\n-------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, Burlington may not rely on the Treaty's umbrella clause to enforce its purported rights under the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework because (i) Ecuador has not \"entered into\" any obligation in enacting the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework, (ii) the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework is of a general nature and unrelated to any specific investment, and (iii) in any event, the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework imposes no obligation upon Ecuador. On the other hand, Burlington submits that the Treaty's umbrella clause covers the specific, unilateral commitments Ecuador made to oil companies under the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. In particular, Ecuador committed to indemnify oil companies for any increase in the tax burden and to adjust the oil participation formulas.\n\n1.2.2. Analysis\n---------------\n\n201.\n\nArticle II(3)(c) of the Treaty, the so-called umbrella clause, provides the following:\n\n\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n202.\n\nThe umbrella clause only becomes operative to the extent that a State party to the BIT has entered into an \"obligation.\" Burlington contends that, by enacting the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework, Ecuador entered into (i) an obligation to absorb the effects of any tax increase pursuant to Article 16 of Decree of No. 1417 and (ii) an obligation to ensure that Burlington would receive its fixed participation of monthly crude production according to Article 4 of Law No. 1993-44.\n\n203.\n\nArticle 16 of Decree No. 1417 (\"Article 16\") lays down the following:\n\n\"Economic stability: The parties' production shares in the contract area will be adjusted when the tax system applicable to the contract has been modified, in order to restore the economics of the contract in place before the tax modification\"341 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-89, p. 23 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation).\n\n204.\n\nArticle 4 of Law No. 1993-44 (\"Article 4\") provides in its relevant part that:\n\n\"Once production is initiated, the contractor will have the right to a share of production in the contract area, which will be calculated in accordance with the production shares offered and agreed upon therein, based upon the volume of hydrocarbons produced\"342 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-15, p. 3 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation).\n\n205.\n\nBoth legal provisions presuppose the existence of a \"contract.\" Without a contract, these provisions are inoperative. Thus, Article 16 refers to \"production shares *in the contract* \"343 and to \"the tax system applicable *to the contract*.\"344 For its part, Article 4 provides that the \" *contractor* will have the right to a share of production *in the contract area*.\"345 This prerequisite \"contract\" that would trigger the application of these provisions is naturally one that would be executed in the future. This explains why Article 4 states that the contractor \"will have the right\" \u2013 that is, the contractor has no vested right at that point, but \"will have the right\" once the PSC containing such \"right\" is executed.\n\n*Supra,* at note 341 (emphasis added) *.*\n\n*Id*. (emphasis added).\n\n*Supra,* note 342 (emphasis added).\n\n206.\n\nUnder these legal provisions, Ecuador bound itself to include certain rights in the PSCs to be executed in the future. Hence, the purpose of these provisions was to guarantee future contractors certain contractual rights. But once these contractual rights were effectively incorporated into the actual PSCs, the purpose of these legal provisions would be exhausted. No \"obligation\" under the legal provisions would survive beyond that point. In this case, it appears that the purpose of these provisions was fulfilled: Ecuador entered into PSCs with the Burlington Subsidiaries, and these PSCs did reproduce the terms of Article 16 and of Article 4. As counsel for Ecuador pointed out at the hearing on liability:\n\n\"Suppose there was no [production sharing] contract or [that we] plac[e] ourselves before there is a contract. What is promised by this Article [16] and to whom? One could argue, well, it's a promise to offer that to a foreign investor and to accept a contract containing a clause more or less reproducing this. All right. Let's admit that, and then we shall see. We do see that the promise was kept. The Participation Contracts contained this undertaking. And from the moment the Participation Contracts are signed, there is an undertaking but it is a contractual undertaking\"346 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 208:12-22.\n\n207.\n\nIn fact, the purpose of these legal provisions was exhausted when the promises made under law were turned into contractual obligations. Accordingly, these provisions no longer contain an \"obligation\" independent of the PSCs upon which Burlington may rely for purposes of the umbrella clause.347 For these reasons, Burlington may not avail itself of the umbrella clause to bring claims based solely on Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. On account of this finding, the Tribunal does not need to examine Ecuador's remaining objections to Burlington's umbrella clause claim based on Ecuador's laws and regulations.\n\nThis is not to say, however, that the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law upon which Burlington relies serve no purpose whatsoever. Since the PSCs were to reproduce these provisions \u2013 which they did as Ecuador has admitted \u2013 they may assist in construing those provisions that were incorporated into the PSCs pursuant to the promises made in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework.\n\n1.3. May Burlington rely on the Treaty's umbrella clause to enforce its subsidiary's rights under the PSCs despite the alleged absence of privity between Burlington and Ecuador?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.3.1. Positions of the Parties\n-------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nEcuador alleges that Burlington may not rely on the umbrella clause to enforce its subsidiaries' rights under the PSCs because, contrary to the requirement of the umbrella clause, there is no privity of contract between Burlington and Ecuador. Privity between a creditor and a debtor is part of the ordinary meaning of the term \"obligation\" in the umbrella clause. The expression \"with regard to investments\" narrows down the scope of the \"obligations\" and thus of the umbrella clause. \"Not being a creditor under the [PSCs], Burlington Resources cannot become a creditor under the umbrella clause, the scope of which must reflect the scope of the contractual obligations.\"348 In support of its position, Ecuador relies primarily on the ICSID decisions in *Azurix*, *Siemens* and the *CMS* annulment *.* It also invokes *Gustav Hamester v. Ghana*. Hence, there is a \"series of consistent cases\" which construe the umbrella clause as requiring privity.349 Finally, Ecuador states that the decisions upon which Burlington relies, *Continental Casualty* and *Duke Energy*, are of no assistance on this issue.\n\nTr. 193:18-21.\n\nTr. 199:2-3.\n\n209.\n\nBurlington, on the other hand, submits that the Treaty's umbrella clause requires no privity. The umbrella clause applies to \"any obligation [...] entered into with regard to investments.\"350 The reference to \" *any* obligation\" shows that the clause is meant to be broad and cover all obligations. The choice of the word \"investment\" is telling. The Treaty only requires that the obligations be entered \"with regard to [Burlington's] investments\", and not the investor, *i.e.* Burlington. In accordance with Article I of the Treaty, \"investments\" covers both direct and indirect investments. Thus, the plain language of the Treaty does not require privity. A narrower formulation calling for privity could have been used, but Ecuador and the United States \"deliberately chose the broader term in the Umbrella Clause.\"351 In addition, Ecuador's interpretation of the umbrella clause is contrary to the purpose of the Treaty, which protects both direct and indirect investments. Burlington denies that there is a \"series of consistent cases\" requiring privity and points to the decision in *Continental Casualty*.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 201.\n\nTr. 148:4-6.\n\n1.3.2. Analysis\n---------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal will focus on the Treaty's umbrella clause and its interpretation under international law (i), and then turn to the ICSID case law dealing with the issue of the umbrella clause's scope (ii).\n\n*(i) The interpretation of the Treaty's umbrella clause*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Treaty's umbrella clause reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n212.\n\nIn application of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Tribunal will interpret the umbrella clause in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty. To avoid any ambiguity in the context of the debate on the significance of umbrella clauses, the Tribunal stresses that the interpretation question it faces is not whether the term \"obligation\" comprises commitments deriving from laws and regulations in addition to contract as some tribunals have found.352 Here, there is no doubt that the obligations at issue arise out of a contract. Nor is the question whether obligations resulting from a commercial contract should be protected under the umbrella clause, or in other words whether a distinction should be made depending on the State's acting as a sovereign or as a merchant.353 Here, if the hurdle of the contract partner is overcome, there is no question that Ecuador entered into the PSCs as a sovereign.354 The question at hand is exclusively whether the umbrella clause protection applies to obligations entered into not between the State and the investor and Claimant, but between the State and an affiliate of the investor.\n\n*Noble Energy Inc. and MachalaPower Cia. Ltda. v. Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad*, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 5 March 2008, at \u00b6 157 (Exh. CL-32); *Continental* *Casualty Company v.

Argentine Republic*, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 27 April 2007, at \u00b6 79 (Exh. CL-40); *Joy Mining Mach. Ltd. v. The Arab Republic of Egypt,* Award on Jurisdiction dated 6 August 2004, at \u00b6 72 (Exh. CL-73).\n\nWhile the Decision on Jurisdiction held that the PSCs did not qualify as \"investment agreements\" under Art. VI(1)(a) and X(2)(c) of the BIT, it did so only because there was no privity between the Claimant and the Respondent, not because the PSCs were commercial contracts (DJ, \u00b6 235).\n\n213.\n\nBearing these delimitations in mind, the Tribunal first notes that the Treaty's umbrella clause imposes an obligation on the Contracting States (\"shall observe\"). Their obligation consists in observing \"any obligation\", which terms are further specified by the words \"entered into\" and \"with regard to investments.\"\n\n214.\n\nThe word \"obligation\" is thus the operative term of the umbrella clause. The Treaty does not define \"obligation\". The Parties agree \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 that the clause refers to legal obligations. This is of little assistance, however, to resolve the question of privity. To answer this question, the Tribunal relies primarily on two elements which in its view inform the ordinary meaning of \"obligation.\" First, in its ordinary meaning, the obligation of one subject is generally seen in correlation with the right of another. Or, differently worded, someone's breach of an obligation corresponds to the breach of another's right.355 An obligation entails a party bound by it and another one benefiting from it, in other words, entails an obligor and an obligee. Second, an obligation does not exist in a vacuum. It is subject to a governing law. Although the notion of obligation is used in an international treaty, the court or tribunal interpreting the treaty may have to look to municipal law to give it content. This is not peculiar to \"obligation\"; it applies to other notions found in investment treaties, *e.g.* nationality, property, exhaustion of local remedies to name just these.356 In this case, the PSCs are governed by Ecuadorian law. It is that law that defines the content of the obligation including the scope of and the parties to the undertaking, *i.e.* the obligor and the obligee.\n\n*E.g.* with respect to the notion of obligation under international law, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,* Text adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission's report covering the work of that session (A/56/10); *Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001,* vol. II, Part Two (Exh. CL-127).\n\n*E.g.*, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines,* (hereinafter \" *SGS* \" ), \u00b6 126; (Exh. EL-73). *Nottebohm Case (second phase), Judgment of April 6th, 1955 : I.C.J. Reports 1955, p.4; and Case concerning certain German interests in Polish Upper Silesia (The Merits), Judgment of 25 May 1926, PCIJ, Series A \u2013 No. 27.* BROWNLIE, Ian. *Principles of Public International Law.* Oxford University Press, Seventh Edition (2008), p. 36; and WEERAMANTRY, J. Romesh. *Treaty Interpretation in Investment Arbitration*, Oxford University Press (2012), *at* 6.36, p. 167.\n\n215.\n\nApplying these two elements to this case, one cannot but conclude that the umbrella clause does not protect obligations arising from the PSCs. Whose right is correlated to the obligation? The answer is found in the law governing the obligation, here Ecuadorian law. Burlington has not alleged, not to speak of established, that under Ecuadorian law the non-signatory parent of a contract party may directly enforce its subsidiary's rights.\n\n216.\n\nThe context of the term \"obligation\" confirms this conclusion. Although not conclusive in and of themselves, the words \"entered into\" can be regarded as reinforcing the idea of privity. As to the terms \"with regard to investments\" also employed by the relevant treaty provision, they denote a \"link between the obligation and the investment\" as Burlington argued at the hearing. This is certainly in keeping with the object and purpose of the Treaty, which are to encourage and protect investments. However, as Ecuador pleaded, this link \"does not replace but qualifies\" the notion of obligation.\n\n217.\n\nIf there is no obligation in the first place, there is nothing to qualify. Nor can these qualifications create an \"obligation\" where there is none to begin with. Burlington argues that, because the definition of investment in Article I of the Treaty covers both direct and indirect investment, it is a co-obligee of Ecuador's obligations under the PSCs. Broad as the definition of investment in the Treaty may be, it cannot compensate for the absence of an \"obligation.\"\n\n218.\n\nThe object and purpose of the Treaty lead to no different conclusion. Burlington claims that reading a privity component into the umbrella clause would be \"contrary to the spirit of the Treaty\"357 which, by virtue of the definition of investment in Article I, seeks to protect both direct and indirect investments. The Tribunal cannot agree. The umbrella clause is only one of the various substantive protections that the Treaty bestows upon investors, with the scope of protection depending on the terms of each specific provision. Other Treaty provisions unquestionably protect both direct and indirect investments, such as for instance the expropriation clause. The object and purpose of the Treaty do not impose that all standards of protection have the same scope.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 135.\n\n219.\n\nBurlington further maintains that it would be ironic for it to not be able to rely on the umbrella clause on the ground that it did not sign the PSCs, when Ecuador has asserted counterclaims precisely on the basis of the PSCs.358 Here again, the Tribunal cannot follow this argument for the reason that its jurisdiction over the counterclaims is based on a specific submission agreement.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 307.\n\n220.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal holds that, Burlington may not rely on the Treaty's umbrella clause to enforce against Ecuador its subsidiary's contract rights under the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. This conclusion is supported by ICSID case law, the import and meaning of which has been heavily debated by the Parties. Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a disagrees with these findings for the reasons explained in the attached dissenting opinion.\n\n*(ii) ICSID case law*\n---------------------\n\n221.\n\nBefore examining the specific cases upon which the Parties rely, the Tribunal must address a threshold matter concerning the precedential value of ICSID cases. Burlington has sought to diminish the relevance of some of the cases upon which Ecuador relies on the ground that statements which Ecuador cites are *obiter dicta*. Ecuador for its part has argued that in the context of investment arbitration, \"[e]verything counts.\"359 The Tribunal tends to agree with Ecuador. It is correct that there is no formal rule of *stare decisis* in international investment arbitration. At the same time, the Tribunal considers that it should \"contribute to the harmonious development of investment law\" and promote a predictable legal order.360 In this light, there is no reason to distinguish between *obiter dicta* and holding. Whether peripheral or central to the decision*,* the statements of an international investment tribunal may provide guidance to investors and host States alike, and may serve to predict the decisions of future tribunals.\n\nTr. 198:12.\n\nDJ, \u00b6 100.\n\n222.\n\nThe decisions in *Azurix*, *Siemens* and the *CMS* annulment proceedings appear to require privity of contract between the investor and the host State for purposes of the umbrella clause. In an award rendered in July 2006, the *Azurix* tribunal dealt with an umbrella clause contained in the United States-Argentina BIT, the wording of which is identical to the u *mbrella clau* se under examination here. The *Azurix* tribunal held as follows:\n\n\"As already stated by the Tribunal in affirming its jurisdiction within the limits permitted by the Convention and the BIT, the Tribunal finds that none of the contractual claims as such refer to a contract between the parties to these proceedings; neither the Province [of Buenos Aires] nor ABA are parties to them. While Azurix may submit a claim under the BIT for breaches by Argentina, there is no undertaking to be honored by Argentina to Azurix other than the obligations under the BIT. Even if for argument's sake, it would be possible under Article II(2)(c) to hold Argentina responsible for the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement by the Province, it was ABA and not Azurix which was the party to this Agreement. \"361 (emphasis added).\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (hereinafter \" *Azurix* \"), Award of 14 July 2006, at \u00b6 384 (Exh. CL-121).\n\n223.\n\nThe implication of this reasoning is evident. The parties to the underlying agreement were the Province of Buenos Aires and ABA, Azurix's subsidiary. Azurix itself was not a party to the agreement. For this reason, even assuming *arguendo* that Argentina had been bound by the agreement, Azurix could not have relied on the treaty's umbrella clause to bring claims based on that contract against Argentina. The unstated but obvious premise is that the umbrella clause required privity between the investor and Argentina.362\n\nThe contract between ABA and the Province of Buenos Aires was governed by Argentine law. The *Azurix* Tribunal held that, while its inquiry on the merits was governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law, the law of Argentina would assist its inquiry \"into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement to which Argentin[e] law applies\". *Azurix* Award, at \u00b6 67 (Exh. CL-121).\n\n224.\n\nSome time later, the tribunal in *Siemens*363 dealt with an umbrella clause contained in the Germany-Argentina BIT. This umbrella clause provided that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in its territory.\" In its award of February 2007, the *Siemens* tribunal stated as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that Article 7(2) has the meaning that its terms express, namely, that failure to meet obligations undertaken by one of the Treaty parties in respect to any particular investment is converted by this clause into a breach of the Treaty. Whether an arbitral tribunal is the tribunal which has jurisdiction to consider that breach or whether it should be considered by the tribunals of the host State of the investor is a matter that this Tribunal does not need to enter. The Claimant is not a party to the Contract and SITS is not a party to these proceedings. \"364 (emphasis added).\n\nThe *Azurix* and the *Siemens* Tribunals were both chaired by the same arbitrator, Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda.\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, Award and Separate Opinion of 6 February 2007, at \u00b6 204 (Exh. CL-79).\n\n225.\n\nJust like in *Azurix*, the implication is clear. The parties to the underlying contract were Argentina and SITS, Siemens' subsidiary.365 Siemens itself was not a party to the contract. Therefore, Siemens could not invoke the treaty's umbrella clause in order to bring contract claims against Argentina. Once again, the implicit premise is that the umbrella clause requires privity.\n\nOnce again, Argentine law governed the Contract \u2013 that is, the underlying obligation that Siemens was seeking to enforce via the umbrella clause.\n\n226.\n\nIn September 2007, the CMS *ad hoc* Committee issued its decision. While this Tribunal stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction that \"no general rule\"366 on privity could be extrapolated from the *CMS* annulment decision, it joined the issue to the merits because the Parties had not sufficiently discussed it in the course of the jurisdictional phase.367 Now with the benefit of the Parties' extensive submissions and legal authorities, the Tribunal is better poised to construct the scope of the Treaty's umbrella clause.\n\nDJ, \u00b6 195. The reason being that the *ad hoc* Committee annulled the tribunal's award for failure to state reasons, not for manifest excess of powers. *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (hereinafter \" *CMS* \"), Annulment Proceeding, Decision of the *Ad Hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic of 25 September 2007 (Exh. CL-72, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98).\n\nDJ, \u00b6\u00b6 197-198.\n\n227.\n\nIn the *CMS* annulment proceedings, Argentina alleged that the tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers because it had allowed CMS to bring claims against Argentina under the umbrella clause even though CMS \"was not a party to any of the applicable instruments.\"368 As in *Azurix*, the applicable umbrella clause was that of the United States-Argentina BIT, which is identical to the present one. Although the *ad hoc* Committee annulled the award for failure to state reasons and not for manifest excess of powers, it made the following observation in the context of its umbrella clause analysis:\n\n\"The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the *parties* to the obligation *(i.e.,* the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause\"369 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 46.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision, at \u00b6 95(c) (Exh. CL-72).\n\n228.\n\nThe *CMS ad hoc* Committee expressed the premise which the *Azurix* and the *Siemens* tribunals had left unstated. First, in keeping with this Tribunal's analysis, the *ad hoc* Committee stated that an obligation has an obligor (\"the person bound by it\") and an obligee (\"the person [\u2026] entitled to rely on it\"). Second, still in conformity with the Tribunal's view, the *ad hoc* Committee stated that the obligation remains governed by its proper law and that the parties to the obligation are not changed by reason of the umbrella clause. Thus, the umbrella clause does not expand the universe of obligees who may rely on the underlying obligation.\n\n229.\n\nBurlington has sought to distinguish the *CMS* annulment decision on the ground that CMS was a minority shareholder, whereas in this case Burlington wholly owns the special investment vehicle party to the PSCs \u2013 Burlington Oriente. The Tribunal does not see why this is a distinguishing factor. Both the *CMS* annulment Committee and this Tribunal held that the notion of \"obligation\" presupposes a person entitled to rely on it or an obligee. Not being a party to the PSCs, Burlington is not an obligee and cannot become one for the reason that it owns all the shares of a signatory party.\n\n230.\n\nBurlington also submits that the *CMS* tribunal \u2013 as opposed to the *ad hoc* Committee \u2013 indicated that there is \"no bar in current international law to the concept of allowing claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned\"370 and that it went on to note that \"[w]hether the protected investor is in addition a party to a concession agreement or a license agreement with the host State is immaterial for the purpose of finding jurisdiction under those treaty provisions, since there is a direct right of action of shareholders.\"371 Although counsel for the Claimant argued that \"[a]d hoc committees are not inherently superior to [a]rbitral [t]ribunals, whether in their composition or in their entitlement to create jurisprudence\",372 one cannot disregard that the ICSID Convention entrusts *ad hoc* committees with the power to annul awards and that this *ad hoc* Committee annulled this award on this very point.373\n\n*CMS* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 48 (Exh. CL-180); CPHB, \u00b6 300.\n\n*CMS* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 65 (Exh. CL-180); CPHB, \u00b6 301.\n\nTr. 1303:9-12.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision, at \u00b6 97 (Exh. CL-72).\n\n231.\n\nIn support of the requirement of privity, Ecuador also invokes *Gustav Hamester v. Ghana.*374 The facts of that case were different because the contract at issue was between the investor and a State entity, as opposed to a contract between a subsidiary of the investor and the State. In spite of this difference, this case equally confirms the need for privity. The *Gustav Hamester* tribunal observed that the *CMS* annulment decision \"made it clear that [\u2026] a contractual obligation between a public entity distinct from the State and a foreign investor cannot be transformed by the magic of the so-called \"umbrella clause\" into a treaty obligation of the State towards a protected investor[\u2026]\"375 By the same token, the umbrella clause cannot transform a contract obligation of the State towards an investor's subsidiary into an obligation to the investor itself.\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana* (hereinafter \" *Gustav Hamester* \"), Award, 18 June 2010 (Exh. EL-150); RPHB, \u00b6 580.\n\n*Gustav* *Hamester*, at \u00b6 346.\n\n232.\n\nFinally, Burlington relies on *Continental Casualty,* a decision of September 2008.376 Construing the umbrella clause of the United States-Argentina BIT invoked in *Azurix* and *CMS*, the *Continental Casualty* tribunal stated that it was \"conscious that the interpretation of umbrella clauses [\u2026] remains controversial and that there is a lack of consistency\" with respect to its scope.377 It eventually dismissed all umbrella clause claims because the underlying obligations were either too general or covered by the necessity defense.378 It also mentioned that the obligations covered by the umbrella clause \"may have been entered with persons or entities other than foreign investors themselves.\"379\n\nBurlington also relied on *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, Award of 18 August 2008 (Exh. CL-41). However, as Ecuador noted, there was no privity issue in *Duke Energy* because the investor's majority-owned subsidiary - Electroquil -was a party to the case and jurisdiction was premised on both an arbitration agreement and an investment treaty (*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 119, 170). \u00b6\n\n*Continental Casualty*, at \u00b6 296.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 302-303.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 297.\n\n233.\n\nIt is debatable whether the *Azurix*, *Siemens,* and *CMS* annulment decisions constitute a \"series of consistent cases\" stating that the umbrella clause requires privity. Indeed, the views expressed in these cases are supported by few reasons, if any, and a different opinion is adopted in *Continental Casualty*.380 Be this as it may, it is certain that the majority of the ICSID case law supports the Tribunal's conclusion that the protection granted under the umbrella clause requires privity between the investor and the host State.\n\nBurlington has also cited the Reader's Guide to the Energy Charter Treaty to buttress its argument that the umbrella clause in the Treaty must cover both direct and indirect investments (CSM, \u00b6 132). First, as the Claimant conceded, the umbrella clause's formula in the Energy Charter Treaty is \"broader\" than in the Treaty under examination (*Id*.). Second, there is no similar explanatory guide to the Treaty showing that the United States and Ecuador intended the umbrella clause to cover both direct and indirect investments.\n\n234.\n\nFor these reasons, the majority concludes that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's umbrella clause claims according to which Ecuador would have failed to adjust the contractor's oil production share and to guarantee the contractor's participation in oil production.\n\n2. Are the *Caducidad* Decrees Part of Burlington's Case?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction on 2 June 2010. Only a few weeks later, on 20 July 2010, Ecuador's Minister of Non-Renewable Natural Resources declared the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 by issuing the so-called *caducidad* decrees. The *caducidad* decrees thus post-date the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, as a consequence of which neither Party had the opportunity to address the *caducidad* decrees in its jurisdictional pleadings. In this Section, the Tribunal will examine (i) whether Burlington has challenged the *caducidad* decrees; if so, (ii) whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decrees, and (iii) whether the allegations based on the *caducidad* decrees are admissible.\n\n2.1. Has Burlington challenged the *caducidad* decrees?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nEcuador argues that \"*caducidad* is simply not part of this case.\"381 It submits that Burlington contests neither the *caducidad* decrees nor the procedures leading up to their declaration.382 Burlington has portrayed the *caducidad* decrees as being merely \"symbolic\" because the purported expropriation of its investment had already been consummated at the time those decrees were issued. Burlington has not specifically answered Ecuador's allegations that Burlington has not challenged the *caducidad* decrees and that, as a result, the *caducidad* decrees are not part of this case. Therefore, the Tribunal will have to determine whether Burlington has challenged the *caducidad* decrees on the basis of the whole record.\n\nTr. 301:20-21.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 153.\n\n237.\n\nAs part of the factual background to the case, Burlington alleged that Ecuador terminated the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 via the *caducidad* process.383 Subsequently, at the very outset of its legal discussion in the same memorial, Burlington argued that \"Ecuador's *measures* have deprived [it] of the use and enjoyment of its investments\"384 (emphasis added). Burlington then listed six measures which, \"both individually and in the aggregate\"385, allegedly expropriated its investment: the last measure includes the termination of the PSCs via the *caducidad* decrees. While Burlington remarked that this termination was \"symbolic\"386 because its \"investment already had been expropriated\",387 it also claimed that \"[w]ith this action [...] Ecuador foreclosed any possibility of Burlington returning to the legal and fiscal regime it had been [previously] guaranteed [\u2026].\"388\n\nCSM, \u00a7 II(C)(4), \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 80.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., last bullet point.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n238.\n\nIn other words, in the Supplemental Memorial, Burlington (i) characterized the *caducidad* decrees as one of the measures which both individually and in combination with other measures allegedly expropriated its investment, and (ii) argued that the *caducidad* decrees made it impossible to revert to the *status quo* which it had enjoyed before the measures of which it complains in this arbitration were adopted. In the view of the Tribunal, these allegations show that Burlington does challenge the *caducidad* decrees.\n\n239.\n\nSimilarly, Burlington devoted some attention to the *caducidad* decrees at the hearing. First, counsel for Burlington cross-examined Minister Wilson P\u00e1stor Morris extensively on the subject of the *caducidad* decrees.389 Second, counsel for Burlington referred to the *caducidad* decrees as follows during the Parties' closing statements:\n\n\"Next, proceedings were commenced for *caducidad*, a contract termination method that sought to excuse Ecuador. The allegation was a breach of Article 74(4) of the Hydrocarbons Law which allegedly did not permit suspension of operations without [\" *justa causa* \"], without just cause.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nNow, of course, the *caducidad* Decision \u2013 let's not be under any illusions \u2013 was reverse-engineered so that Ecuador sought to escape from its contractual obligations with the Claimant. The idea that there could have been any fair consideration of the Claimants' position in a process whereby the Minister has to judge acts of the Government that appointed him has no logic, particularly where he was being advised by Government lawyers whose very description of this Tribunal's order used the verb \" *recomendar* \" in just the description of the document when that verb appears nowhere in your order. He was a judge in his own cause assisted by lawyers to his own cause.\"390 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 874:17-902:5.\n\nTr. 1288:10-15 and 1291:13-1292:3.\n\n240.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador's goal in enacting the *caducidad* decrees was to \"escape from its contractual obligations with the Claimant\" and the *caducidad* process could not be \"fair\", as the Minister who issued the decrees was a \"[j]udge in his own cause.\"391 These statements show once again that Burlington contests both the process leading to, and the substance of, the *caducidad* decrees.\n\nTr. 1291:13-1292:3.\n\n241.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Burlington has challenged the *caducidad* decrees, which are thereby part of this case. In light of this conclusion, the Tribunal must address Ecuador's jurisdictional and admissibility objections to the *caducidad* decrees.\n\n2.2. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decrees?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nEcuador contends that the Tribunal has no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decrees for Blocks 7 and 21. While Burlington has not specifically countered these jurisdictional objections, it is clear from its argumentation on the merits that it considers that there is jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decrees. Therefore, the Tribunal will address these objections on the basis of Ecuador's arguments and relevant elements on record.\n\n243.\n\nEcuador argues that the Tribunal has no contractual or Treaty jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decree for Block 7. The Tribunal has no contractual jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decrees because clauses 21.2.3392 and 21.2.4393 of the PSC for Block 7 carve out this form of contract termination from the contractual jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Furthermore, the Tribunal has no Treaty jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decree for Block 7 under these clauses because (i) the PSC for Block 7 was signed after the Treaty was signed, and (ii) that is what the parties to the contract intended to achieve through the language of clause 20.4.\n\nClause 21.2.3 of the PSC for Block 7 states that when \" the Contract is terminated for reasons other than *caducidad*, the procedures to which the Parties have agreed in Clause [20] will be followed.\" (RCM, \u00b6 156); (Exh. C-1).\n\nClause 21.2.4 of the PSC for Block 7 sets forth that \"for purposes of caducidad and other sanctions, the provisions of Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law will apply.\" (Exh. C-1); (RCM, \u00b6 156).\n\n244.\n\nIn the same vein, Ecuador maintains that the Tribunal has no contractual or Treaty jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decree for Block 21. The Tribunal has no contractual jurisdiction over *caducidad* because this is a \"legal matter\" excluded from the scope of the arbitration agreement pursuant to clause 20.2 of the contract. In addition, the Tribunal has no Treaty jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decrees because (i) the PSC for Block 21 was signed two years after the Treaty was signed, and (ii) that is what the parties to the contract intended to achieve through the language of clause 20.2.20.\n\n245.\n\nIn other words, Ecuador argues that the original parties to the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 intended to carve out *caducidad* not only from the scope of the PSC, but also from the scope of the Treaty. Since the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is premised exclusively on the Treaty, the Tribunal does not need to address *per se* the question of whether the original parties intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the PSCs. It must, however, address the Treaty-based objections.\n\n246.\n\nEcuador argues that the original parties to the PSC for Block 7 intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty, and thus from the scope of the Treaty's jurisdiction. They did so by inserting clause 20.4 into the PSC, which reads as follows:\n\n\"In addition and without prejudice to the provisions of clauses [20.2]394 and [20.3]395 of this participation contract, the Parties also agree to submit any investment-related dispute to the Treaties, Conventions, Protocols and other international law agreements signed and ratified by Ecuador in accordance with the law.\"396\n\nClause 20.2 of the PSC for Block 7 provides that \"all controversies arising from this Participation Contract will be settled by arbitration of law in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Hydrocarbons Law as amended, the Arbitration and Mediation Law [\u2026] and the rules and procedures laid down in this clause\" (Tribunal's translation). There is no mention of *caducidad* in clause 20.2 of the PSC for Block 7 (Exh. C-1).\n\nClause 20.3 of the PSC for Block 7 provides that \"[n]otwithstanding the foregoing, from the date on which the [ICSID Convention] (the \"Convention\"), signed by the Republic of Ecuador, be ratified by the Ecuadorian Congress, the Parties commit to submit the controversies or disputed relating to or arising from the execution of this Participation Contract to the jurisdiction and competence of the [ICSID] so that they may be settled and resolved in conformity with the provisions of that Convention [\u2026]\" (Tribunal's translation). There is no mention of *caducidad* in clause 20.3 of the PSC for Block 7 (Exh. C-1).\n\nExh. C-1 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n247.\n\nThis clause does not appear to reflect an intent by the original parties to the PSC for Block 7 to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty. The *caducidad* process is not specifically mentioned in this clause. Far from signalling an intent to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty, this clause underscores the will of the original parties to the contract to submit \"any investment-related dispute\" to international treaties, of which the United States-Ecuadorian BIT is undoubtedly one. This clause appears to reinforce, not to undermine, the Tribunal's Treaty jurisdiction. Even assuming that the original parties to the PSC for Block 7 intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the contract's arbitration agreement, there is no evidence that they intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decree for Block 7.\n\n248.\n\nEcuador similarly argues that the original parties to the PSC for Block 21 intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty. According to Ecuador, this follows from clause 20.2.20 of the PSC, which provides that:\n\n\"In the event that the Ecuadorian State or PETROECUADOR enter or have entered into an international treaty which, in accordance with the law, provides for the resolution of technical or economic disputes by a different arbitration mechanism, or if so allowed by Ecuadorian law, the Parties agree that they will be able to submit the issue in dispute to that arbitration.\"397\n\nExh. C-2 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n249.\n\nThis clause does not suggest that the original parties to the PSC for Block 21 intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty, nor does it signal an intent to diminish the scope of Treaty jurisdiction. It rather shows an intent \"to submit\"398 to Treaty arbitration \"technical or economic disputes.\"399 There is no reason to infer that the terms \"technical or economic disputes\"400 aim to remove *caducidad* -related disputes from the scope of Treaty arbitration \u2013 especially since the termination of a PSC has evident economic implications. On the contrary, this clause aims to bolster, not to weaken, Treaty arbitration. Even assuming that the original parties to PSC for Block 21 intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the contract's arbitration agreement, there is no evidence that they intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty.401 Thus, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the *caducidad* decree for Block 21.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\nEcuador also argues that the original parties to the PSC for Block 21 intended to remove *caducidad* from the scope of the US-Ecuador BIT because the contract was executed after the Treaty was signed. Indeed, while the Treaty was signed on 27 August 1993, the PSC for Block 21 was signed on 20 March 1995, \u2013 but only entered into force on 11 May 1997, after the execution of the PSC. At any rate, the conclusion that clause 20.2.20 of the PSC for Block 21 does not remove *caducidad* from the scope of the Treaty is unaffected by this chronology.\n\n250.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction under the Treaty over the *caducidad* decrees relating to the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n2.3. Are the allegations based on the *caducidad* decrees admissible?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nEcuador argues that Burlington's allegations relating to *caducidad* are premature because Burlington has not challenged the *caducidad* decrees before the Ecuadorian administrative courts. It notes that, whereas Burlington was not required to exhaust local remedies before commencing this arbitration, it was required to make a reasonable attempt to seek redress before domestic courts. Hence, Burlington's allegation relating to the *caducidad* decrees is inadmissible. Although Burlington has not specifically answered this objection, its argumentation shows that it opposes it. The Tribunal will thus address it on the basis of Ecuador's arguments and other relevant elements in the record.\n\n252.\n\nIn the Supplemental Memorial on Liability, Burlington made the following allegations in relation to the *caducidad* decrees:\n\n\"On September 28, 2009, PetroEcuador petitioned the Minister of Non-Renewable Natural Resources to terminate the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. PetroEcuador took the position that the Consortium had abandoned the Blocks 7 and 21 operations and that this was sufficient cause to terminate the PSCs under the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. Perenco, on behalf of the Consortium, immediately objected to the initiation of the *caducidad* process, because the determination of the legality of Law No. 2006-42 payments and the physical occupation of Blocks 7 and 21 were pending before the *Burlington* and *Perenco* tribunals\"402 (emphasis added).\n\nCSM, \u00b6 77.\n\n253.\n\nEcuador has not disputed these allegations. It therefore appears that Perenco \"immediately objected to the initiation of the *caducidad* process\" and that it did so \"on behalf of the Consortium.\" In fact, Ecuador has expressly admitted that, as the operator of the Block, Perenco was contractually bound to \"deal with the government\" on behalf of the Consortium.403 Hence, Perenco's objection to the *caducidad* process was raised on behalf of both Consortium partners, including Burlington Oriente. Under the facts of this case, this constituted a reasonable enough attempt to seek local redress. Thus, the Tribunal sees no reason to declare Burlington's allegations relating to the *caducidad* decrees inadmissible.\n\n\"[T]here is a specific provision saying very clearly that only the operator should deal with the government. So the operator of this Consortium, as you know, Members of the Tribunal, was Perenco. This is a simple application of a contractual provision.\" Tr. 1349:18-22; *see* also RPHB, \u00b6 202.\n\n**C. EXPROPRIATION**\n--------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal must now address the merits of the claim over which it has jurisdiction, the expropriation claim. The nub of Burlington's case is that each of Ecuador's measures individually404 (the Law 42 tax, the *coactiva* seizures and the takeover of the Blocks) and all of them collectively constituted an unlawful expropriation of its investment. Ecuador denies that any of these measures expropriated Burlington's investment, whether considered individually or collectively. In the alternative, Ecuador argues that, if there was expropriation, it was lawful under the circumstances.\n\nSpecifically, Burlington measure-by-measure case is that the Law 42 tax (at both 50% and 99%) constituted an indirect expropriation of its investment (\"a measure tantamount to expropriation\" (CSM, \u00b6 82)); and that the *coactiva* seizures and the physical takeover of the Blocks constituted a direct expropriation of its investment (\"a direct confiscation\", \"a direct taking\" and \"a direct expropriation\"; CSM, \u00b6\u00b6 90, 91 and 94).\n\n255.\n\nThe Treaty contains the following provision on expropriation:\n\n\"Article III\n\n1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\") except : for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II (3) [transcribed below]. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable and be freely transferable.\"405\n\nArticle II (3) to which Article III refers reads as follows:\n\n\"Article II\n\n3. (a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\n\n(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\n\n(c) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"406\n\nThe Treaty at Article III (Exh. C-6).\n\nThe Treaty at Article II (Exh. C-6).\n\n256.\n\nThe Treaty thus establishes a general prohibition against expropriation of investments unless certain specified requirements are cumulatively met, in which case the expropriation is lawful. In order to adjudicate Burlington's expropriation claim, the Tribunal must first determine what Burlington's investment was (Section 1) and in particular what rights Burlington had under the PSCs (Section 2). In so doing, the Tribunal does not act as a contract judge but exclusively as a treaty judge, addressing contract matters as preliminary issues insofar as it is necessary to rule on a Treaty claim. Subsequently, the Tribunal's task will be to decide whether Ecuador expropriated Burlington's investment (Section 3) and, if there was expropriation, whether the expropriation was unlawful (Section 4).\n\n1. Burlington's Investment in Ecuador\n-------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Treaty provides that \"investments shall not be expropriated.\" The Tribunal understands from this formulation that the focus of the expropriation analysis must be on the investment as a whole, and not on discrete parts of the investment. Other international tribunals have adopted the same approach. The tribunal in *Telenor v. Hungary*, for instance, stated that in the context of a claim for expropriation \"the investment must be viewed as a whole [\u2026].\"407 Likewise, the tribunal in *Merrill v. Canada* noted that \"the business of the investor has to be considered as a whole [\u2026].\"408 In the same vein, the tribunal in *Feldman v. Mexico* held that a State measure that effectively extinguished an entire line of the investor's business \u2013 cigarette exports \u2013 did not amount to an expropriation of its investment as a whole.409\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. Republic of Hungary*, Award of 13 September 2006, \u00b6 67 (Exh. EL-112)\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Canada*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Award of 31 March 2010, \u00b6 144 (Exh. CL-155).\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, (hereinafter \" *Feldman\"*), Award on Merits of 16 December 2002, \u00b6 152 (Exh. EL-80).\n\n258.\n\nThe Parties seem, however, to have focused on a narrower view of investment. In its initial Memorial, for instance, Burlington alleged that Ecuador's measures had injured its \"investments\" in Ecuador, defining these \"investments\" as the \"rights in the four contracts [at the time the PSCs for Blocks 23 and 24 were still part of the dispute] for the exploration and exploitation of crude reserves in Ecuador.\"410 Burlington claimed to possess those rights \"[t]hrough its ownership of [Burlington Oriente].\"411 Hence, according to Burlington, the rights under the PSCs constituted in and of themselves the investment. Consistent with this submission, counsel for Burlington expressed the following view at the hearing:\n\n\"Well, surely the nexus between the PSCs and Burlington's investment is undeniable: Not only were the PSCs linked to Burlington's investments, no, they were Burlington's investments \"412 (emphasis added).\n\nMem., \u00b6 299.\n\nMem., \u00b6 303.\n\nTr. 145:17-20. Admittedly, Burlington also invoked its rights derived from the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. However, as the Tribunal previously concluded, the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework contains no existing \"obligation\" (*see supra*, Section IV(B)(1.2)).\n\n259.\n\nEcuador neither explicitly accepted Burlington's definition of investment, nor did it challenge it as unduly narrow but it made its arguments within the framework of that definition. For instance, in its Counter-Memorial on Liability, Ecuador submitted that the Law 42 tax did not expropriate Burlington's investment because it was not in breach of the PSCs, noting at the same time that \"the investment Burlington alleges is precisely the value of those contract rights\".413\n\nRCM, \u00b6 501.\n\n260.\n\nNevertheless, in line with the cases referred to above, the Tribunal considers that a broader view of investment must be adopted, a view that encompasses Burlington's investment \"as a whole.\" Burlington's investment is not composed solely of the rights of its subsidiary under the PSCs, even if those rights constituted the most valuable portion of Burlington's investment. Burlington's investment included its shares in Burlington Oriente, the infrastructure and equipment employed to exploit oil reserves, any other tangible property related to the project, the monetary and asset contributions made to carry out its operations, and the physical possession of the Blocks.414\n\nThe Tribunal finds its understanding confirmed by other decisions, such as *Saipem S.p.A v. Bangladesh*, (hereinafter \" *Saipem\"*), Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 March 2007, \u00b6 31 (Ex. CL-14) and the very first ICSID Decision on Jurisdiction of 12 May 1974 in *Holidays Inns v. Morocco*, reported in Pierre Lalive, *The First \u2018World Bank' Arbitration (Holiday Inns v. Morocco\"), - Some Legal Problems*, 1 ICSID Reports 645 (1993) at p. 680 in the original pagination (Exh. CL-137).\n\n2. The Rights under the PSCs\n----------------------------\n\n261.\n\nWithout being *per se* investments, the contract rights under the PSCs represented a key component of Burlington's investment. It is by virtue of these contract rights that, through its subsidiary, Burlington had access to a share of the oil produced. These contract rights have a direct incidence on the economic value of Burlington's investment. For this reason, the Parties have devoted considerable attention to the identification of Burlington's rights under the PSCs. Thus, the Tribunal will start by identifying the rights which the PSCs conferred upon Burlington's subsidiary.\n\n262.\n\nThe disagreement of the Parties with respect to the meaning of the PSCs is confined to two main issues. First, the Parties disagree on the meaning of the term \"economy\" of the PSC, a term of crucial importance to understand the economic bargain at the heart of the contracts. Second, under the assumption that the economy of the PSC is affected by a given State measure, they disagree on whether the application of the so-called \"correction factor\" to re-establish the economy is mandatory or not.\n\n2.1. Burlington's position\n--------------------------\n\n263.\n\nBurlington claims (i) that it had the contractual right to receive the full economic value of its oil production share *regardless* of the price of oil, and (ii) that if the economy of the PSCs was affected, the parties were bound to apply a correction factor..\n\n264.\n\nFirst, Burlington claims that under the PSCs it had a right to enjoy the upside of any price increase. Otherwise stated, it claims that it had the right to realize the full economic value of its oil production share without regard to the price of oil \u2013 and subject only to the employment contributions and income tax agreed upon in the PSCs.415 Contrary to what Ecuador argues, the participation formulas were *not* based on the price of oil. The participation formulas were subject to change solely on the basis of increased oil production, quality of the oil, or changes in the tax system. By contrast, the participation formulas were not subject to change because of oil price increases. As counsel for Burlington indicated at the hearing:\n\n\"So, these [participation] percentages would change, amongst other things, with regard to the application of new taxes or with regard to volume [or quality416], but nowhere is any mention made of price as a factor to determine such [oil] share.\n\nAnd consistently, Burlington and the State never agreed that the State's participation would change as the price of oil increased. That was simply part of the risk and reward of the original terms of the Contract. [\u2026] This is entirely consistent with industry practice. Price is not normally included as a factor to determine production share in PSCs. Essentially price is one of the elements of risk and reward that the oil companies insist is not part of any kind of limitation\" (emphasis added).417\n\nCSM, \u00b6 19.\n\n\"[T]here may be an adjustment [of the oil share] for the quality of the crude found \u2013 that's another aspect\" (Tr. 24:8-9).\n\nTr. 24:17-25:15.\n\n265.\n\nAs a result, Burlington's income was not fixed but entirely contingent on the price of oil. If the price of oil increased, Burlington was entitled to the higher revenues resulting from such increase. There was no mathematical-economic equation included in the PSCs:\n\n\"[T]he agreed, fixed equilibrium of the PSCs defined by a mathematical formula simply does not exist. These were risk contracts, which are at odds with any concept of fixed equilibrium, let alone a fixed (therefore guaranteed) rate of return.\"418\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 323.\n\n266.\n\nThe participation formulas constituted the entire agreement between the parties, with each party entitled to realize the full economic value of its oil share regardless of price:\n\n\"[T]he PSCs struck a particular balance between [Ecuador] and private investors, with those investors carrying the risk associated with developing the projects, but also enjoying any potential upside regarding price (and, at the same time, suffering from any downside).\"419\n\nMem., \u00b6 354.\n\n267.\n\nIn sum, for Burlington, the economy of the PSCs meant that it was entitled to realize the full economic value of its oil production share without regard to the price of oil, and subject only to those income and other taxes specifically provided for in the PSCs.\n\n268.\n\nSecond, if a tax measure affected the economy of the PSCs, the parties were under an obligation to apply a correction factor that would absorb the effects of the tax. This followed from the language of the PSCs. The contracts stated that \"if a triggering event occurs, a correction factor will be included.\"420 The terms \"will be included\" implied that the application of a correction factor was mandatory, and not, as argued by Ecuador, merely subject to renegotiation. Thus, the PSCs contained tax stabilization provisions.\n\nTr. 31:18-19.\n\n2.2. Ecuador's position\n-----------------------\n\n269.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, (i) the term economy of the PSCs meant that Burlington only had the right to the price projections upon which the original parties to the PSCs had allocated oil production, that is a price of USD 15 per barrel and a resultant IRR of 15%; and (ii) even assuming that the economy of the PSCs was affected, the contracts merely imposed upon the parties an obligation to renegotiate a correction factor, there being no mandatory adjustment of the parties' participations nor tax stabilization clauses.\n\n270.\n\nFirst, Burlington had no right to windfall profits under the PSCs and thus no right to extraordinary profits resulting from unexpectedly high prices. The PSCs merely allocated oil production volumes between Ecuador and the contractor. This oil allocation was based on the so-called \"Vega model\", a precise mathematical-economic equation upon which the economy of the PSCs was calculated. In other words, the oil participation percentages were but a reflection of the Vega model calculations on the date of conclusion of the PSCs.421\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 335-337.\n\n271.\n\nUnder the Vega model, the contractor's income (\"R\") was calculated on the basis of the following three variables: the production of the Block (\"Q\"); the contractor's participation percentage (\"\"x); and the oil price projections estimated over the life of the contract (\"P\"). In short: R = Q x X x P. Once the contractor's income was calculated, it was possible to determine the internal rate of return (\"IRR\") by factoring in costs, employment contribution and income tax.422\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 338-340; see also Celio Vega WS, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n272.\n\nThe PSCs were based on an oil price projection of USD 15 per barrel, and an IRR of 15%. The price projection based on a price per barrel of USD 15 is part of the Vega model formula. The application of this formula would then yield an IRR of 15% for the contractor. Hence, these two key considerations \u2013 the oil price projections and the contractor's IRR \u2013 were incorporated in the calculation of the contractor's oil participation share. Moreover, in the case of Block 7, the parties' oil price projections over the life of the contract were reflected in Annex V of the PSC. At the hearing, counsel for Ecuador stated:\n\n\"The equation [the Vega model] in the contracts factors among other things the reserves figures and production profile, how much it would cost to get those reserves [from] the ground, revenues \u2013 and this is the important part. I was telling you before we would get to speak about revenues \u2013 here we are \u2013 the revenues that the Parties considered in negotiating this agreement were based on a projection of a price per barrel of $15. This projection, along with the other projections, resulted in an internal rate of return for the Contractor of about 15 percent, and I say about 15 percent because, depending on the Contracts and the risk involved, the figure was more or less around 15.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nWell, as we know, the assumption at the time of contracting was that as long as the price per barrel remained at or around $15 a barrel, obviously adjusted for inflation [\u2026] the Contractor would be able to recover its costs and make a reasonable profit on the basis of an internal rate of return of 15 percent throughout the life of the Contract.\"423\n\nTr. 266:1-13, 267:6-17.\n\n273.\n\nIn sum, Burlington had *no* contractual right to revenues stemming from oil prices in excess of the parties' price assumptions at the time the PSCs were executed, *i.e.* in excess of an inflation-adjusted USD 15 per barrel. The economy of the PSCs meant that Burlington *only* had the right to USD 15 per barrel, which would yield an internal rate of return of 15% \u2013 anything above this oil price was a windfall profit not envisaged by the contracting parties.\n\n274.\n\nSecond, even assuming that the economy of the PSCs were affected, the contracts merely provided for renegotiation. The PSC for Block 7 states that any correction factor \"will be calculated by agreement of the Parties.\"424 The PSC for Block 21, in turn, provides that any adjustment to the participation formulas \"shall be approved by the Administrative Council [\u2026].\"425 It follows from such language that these are merely renegotiation clauses. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide what the parties would have agreed to pursuant to these clauses. In short, even if the economy of the PSCs is affected, the contracts do not impose an obligation to apply a correction factor but merely to renegotiate.426\n\nExh. C-1, clause 11.12.\n\nExh. C-2, clause 11.7.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 345-364.\n\n2.3. Analysis\n-------------\n\n275.\n\nIn light of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal must determine (a) what the economy of the PSCs was, and (b) whether the tax modification clauses calling for the application of a correction factor are mandatory or not, *i.e.* whether they are tax stabilization or renegotiation clauses.\n\n2.3.1. The economy of the PSCs\n------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nIn order to determine what the economy of the PSCs was, the Tribunal will analyze (a) the letter of the PSCs; (b) Annex V of the PSC for Block 7; (c) the Tarapoa contract; (d) Ecuador's conduct; (e) Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law; and (f) the purpose of the shift from service contracts to production sharing contracts.\n\na. The letter of the PSCs\n-------------------------\n\n277.\n\nClause 8.1 of the PSC for Block 7 provides the following in respect of the calculation of the contractor's oil production share:\n\n\"Calculation of the Contractor's Production Share:\n\nThe Contractor's share will be calculated using the following formula:\n\n**PC = [ X. Q ] / 100** 427\n\nWhere:\n\nPC = Contractor's Production Share\n\nQ = Measured Production\n\nX = Average factor, expressed as a percentage rounded to the third decimal place, corresponding to the Contractor's Share of Production.\n\n[...]\"428 (emphasis added).\n\nThe period signifies multiplication.\n\nExh. C-1, clause 8.1.\n\n278.\n\nLikewise, Clause 8.1 of the PSC for Block 21 sets forth the following:\n\n\"Calculation of the Contractor's Share of Production:\n\nThe Contractor's share will be calculated pursuant to the parameters agreed to in this Contract, in accordance with the following formula:\n\n**PC = X. Q**429\n\nWhere:\n\nPC = Contractor's Share of Production\n\nQ = Inspected annual production in the Contract Area\n\nX = average factor, as a percentage, corresponding to the Contractor's share of production [...].\"430 (emphasis added).\n\nThe period signifies multiplication.\n\nExh. C-2, clause 8.1.\n\n279.\n\nFor Ecuador, the contractor's production share is to be calculated in accordance with the following formula: PC = X x Q x P, where \"\"x (contractor's share of production in percentage terms) and \"Q\" (total measured production) coincide with the definitions of clauses 8.1 transcribed above. In addition, Ecuador argues that the contractor's share of production includes the \"P\" factor, *i.e.* the oil price projections estimated over the life of the contract, which would yield an IRR of 15%. However, there is no mention of any such \"P\" factor in clauses 8.1 of the PSCs. Similarly, these clauses do not mention any link between the formula for calculating the contractor's production share and the purported IRR.\n\n280.\n\nMore generally, the formula \"PC = X x Q x P\" \u2013 or the Vega model \u2013 appears nowhere in the PSCs (subject to Annex V of the PSC for Block 7 which will be examined separately), nor is there any mention of the contractor's purported IRR anywhere in the PSCs. This is telling, especially considering how detailed and lengthy the PSCs are. Without counting authorizations and annexes, the PSC for Block 7 contains over 120 pages, and the PSC for Block 21 over 80 pages. If authorizations and annexes are included, both contracts run into the several hundreds of pages \u2013 over 400 pages for the PSC for Block 7 and over 600 pages for the PSC for Block 21. In these circumstances, it is hard to conceive how the original parties to the contract would have left unstated such pivotal aspect of the PSCs, had they intended to include it.\n\n281.\n\nAccordingly, the letter of the PSCs suggests that the economy of the PSCs was linked neither to a price assumption of USD 15 per barrel nor to an IRR of 15%. Instead, it tends to show that the contractor was entitled to the economic value of its oil participation share irrespective of the price of oil or of the contractor's internal rate of return \u2013 subject to the contract's tax provisions examined below.\n\nb. Annex V of the PSC for Block 7\n---------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nEcuador argues that Annex V of the PSC for Block 7 contains the mathematical-economic equation upon which the original parties to the contract purportedly determined the contractor's oil production share, *i.e.* the so-called Vega model. In accordance with clause 24.2,431 Annex V is an integral part of the PSC. Ecuador points in particular to Tables 15, 22 and 27 A of Annex V.432 At the hearing, counsel for Ecuador stated as follows:\n\n\"[T]he economy [of the PSCs] referred to the mathematical and economic equation agreed at the time of the Contract, and you will find such equation, for example, at Annex V of the Block 7 Participation Contract [...]. Well, I think the Contract [for Block 7] is both the text [...] but also its Annexes [...], so I would invite you to keep an eye on Annex V [\u2026].\"433\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 110 at n. 119.\n\nExh. C-1, Annex V (pp. 005212, 005218-005224 in the original pagination).\n\nTr. 265:12-21.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine the purpose of Annex V, whether there is evidence of the Vega Model in Annex V, and whether the notion of the economy of the PSC purportedly arising from Annex V is consistent with the other elements on record, particularly with Law 42.\n\n284.\n\nFirst, Annex V is an internal memorandum from Ecuador's Negotiation Commission for the modification of the Block 7 PSC (the \"Negotiation Commission\") to the President and the Board of Directors of PetroEcuador, dated 3 November 1999. Block 7 was subject to a service contract and thus, unlike blocks such as Block 21, was not part of an international bidding process. At the hearing, counsel for Burlington offered the following explanation in this respect:\n\n\"[T]here needs to be some kind of review by the State as best they can at that moment to work out whether or not it's in the interest of the State to make that migration [to the PSC]. So, Article 10 [of the Hydrocarbons Law] stated, if it's convenient to the interests of the State, the contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons may be modified by agreement of the Contracting Parties. [\u2026] Annex V is simply the memorandum to the PetroEcuador board [which] provides the basis for the approval of the new [PSC] Contract \"434 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 168:15-22, 169:18-20, 172:6-7.\n\n285.\n\nThis explanation finds support in the letter of Annex V and in Article 10 of the Hydrocarbons Law.435 Indeed, the Negotiation Commission concluded that, in accordance with Article 10 of the Hydrocarbons Law, modifying the Block 7 service contract into a PSC would \"suit the interests of the State.\"436 On this basis, the Commission recommended to the President and the Board of PetroEcuador, the addressees of the internal memorandum, to approve the modification of the Block 7 service contract into a PSC if they \"deem[ed] it appropriate.\"437 Hence, Annex V was not intended to set out the terms of the prospective PSC, but merely to establish whether it would be in Ecuador's interest to enter into a PSC in lieu of a service contract from an economic standpoint.\n\nExh. C-15, p. 4 in the original pagination, Art. 10.\n\nExh. C-1, Annex V, p. 005155 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Id*.\n\n286.\n\nIn order to determine whether a PSC was in Ecuador's interest, the Negotiation Commission sought to determine whether the value of a PSC, on a net present value basis, was greater than that of a service contract. To carry out this calculation, it had to assume the price of oil over the life of the contract, expected to run from 2000 to 2010. It used a price assumption of USD 15 per barrel, which explains the price of USD 15 per barrel in Tables 15, 22 and 27 A, upon which Ecuador has focused. Under this price assumption, it concluded that the net present value of a PSC would be greater than that of a service contract for Ecuador, whereas the net present value would be the same for the contractor.438 The price of USD 15 per barrel was thus used to assess whether the modification of the Block 7 services contract was in Ecuador's interest \u2013 *not* to determine the Contractor's participation share or its IRR.\n\n*Id*., at pp. 005176-005177 in the original pagination.\n\n287.\n\nSecond, there appears to be no evidence of the Vega Model in Annex V. While the Commission used a price assumption of USD 15 per barrel, there is no evidence that this assumption was applied in connection with the Vega Model. As seen above, under the Vega Model, the contractor's participation share is based on its percentage (\"\"x) of total oil production (\"Q\") under a specific price assumption (\"P\"). However, Annex V contains no evidence linking \"P\" to \"Q\" or to the contractor's participation share. There is likewise no formula similar to that of clause 8.1 of the contract (PC = X x Q/100) that would suggest a connection between the contractor's participation share and the Commission's price assumption of USD 15 per barrel.\n\n288.\n\nOn the contrary, Annex V contains indications that the contractor's participation share was *not* linked to the price of oil. As part of its description of the negotiation with the contractor, the Negotiation Commission states:\n\n\"As an alternative, it was proposed that an average of USD 17 per barrel be set, with the parties equitably sharing the surplus at 50% each. This proposal was not accepted by the [contractor] either [...]\"439\n\n*Id*., at p. 005153 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation); Mem., \u00b6 102.\n\n289.\n\nFrom the Negotiation Commission's memorandum, it appears that the original parties to the contract specifically discussed the possibility of sharing equally the oil revenues in case the price of oil were to exceed USD 17 per barrel. However, Annex V suggests that the contractor rejected this proposal. The fact that no agreement to this effect was reproduced in the PSC for Block 7 that was concluded about five months after the date of the Annex V suggests that parties did not reconsider this matter, or, if they did, reached no agreement on sharing excess profits.440 In conclusion, Annex V contains no evidence of the Vega Model. On the contrary, it shows that the contractor's participation share was *not* linked to the price of oil.\n\nThe Annex V memorandum is dated 3 November 1999. The PSC for Block 7 was concluded on 23 March 2000 \u2013 that is, nearly five months after the date of the Annex V memorandum.\n\n290.\n\nThird, the economy of the PSC for Block 7 as it allegedly results from Annex V appears inconsistent with the remaining evidence on record as to how the economy of the PSCs is to be ascertained. Under Annex V, the economy of the PSC for Block 7 would be tied to a price of USD 15 per barrel. At the same time, Ecuador has argued that the economy of the PSCs was determined on the date of execution. In the words of counsel for Ecuador:\n\n\"Well, Ecuador's submission, Members of the Tribunal, is that the starting point [...] in this case is the economy of the participation contracts as defined on the date of their execution.441\n\n[....]\n\n[Ecuador's witnesses] all established very clearly that the economy of the Participation Contract \u2013 and it couldn't be otherwise \u2013 is to be established on the date of execution of the Participation Contract \"442 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 262:22-263:4.\n\nTr. 1354:22-1355:3.\n\n291.\n\nOn the date when the PSC for Block 7 was executed *i.e.*, on 23 March 2000, the price of Block 7 oil was USD 25.11 per barrel. In keeping with Ecuador's submission, Law 42 also operates on the basis that the relevant price is the one on the date of execution. This is why Law 42 regards as \"extraordinary\" only those revenues resulting from oil prices in excess of the price of oil on the date the PSCs were executed. As counsel for Ecuador stated:\n\n\" Law 42 takes the price of oil from the market at the time of execution of the Participation Contracts and the extraordinary revenues above that price as corrected by the inflation pursuant to American figures, is to be allocated between the State and the Contractor.\n\n[....]\n\n[T]he Law 42 [reference] price was always above the $15 a barrel price agreed to define the economy of the participation contracts. In fact [...] the [reference] price for Block 7 was $25.11 as of March 2000 \u2013 that is, the date of execution of the Block 7 Participation Contract [...]\"443 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 237:5-10, 269:14-20.\n\n292.\n\nTherefore, there would be two different ways to ascertain the economy of the PSC for Block 7: one based on Annex V, with a price of USD 15, and the other one based on the date of execution of the PSC, with a price of about USD 25. In other words, the economy of the contract purportedly arising from Annex V is inconsistent with Ecuador's submission that the economy of the PSCs is determined on the date of execution, which is the basis upon which Law 42 operates. These inconsistencies reinforce the previous conclusions that Annex V contains no evidence of the Vega model.\n\n293.\n\nIn summary, Annex V does not show that the economy of the PSC for Block 7 was a function of either a price projection of USD 15/bbl or a 15% internal rate of return for the contractor. Thus, Annex V does not appear to set a limit on the revenues that the contractor could derive from its oil participation share.\n\nc. The Tarapoa Contract\n-----------------------\n\n294.\n\nOn 25 July 1995, Ecuador and City Investing Company concluded a PSC for the exploration and exploitation of the Tarapoa Block. Under clause 8.1 of the so-called Tarapoa Contract, the contractor's participation share is a function of its percentage (\"\"x) over total oil production (\"Q\"). The Tarapoa Contract is thus premised on the participation formula \" *PC = X.Q\",* as were the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. Yet, at the end of clause 8.1, the Tarapoa Contract adds the following:\n\n\"If the price of crude oil in the Block exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the surplus of the benefit brought about by the price increase in real terms (calculated at constant values of [1995]) will be distributed between the Parties in equal shares.\"444\n\nExh. C-95, clause 8.1 *in fine* (Tribunal's translation).\n\n295.\n\nThis language creates a link between the economic benefits the contractor may draw from the contract and the price of oil. If the price of oil exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the additional revenues are apportioned between Ecuador and the contractor on a 50/50 basis. This apportionment does not affect the contractor's participation share in terms of oil volumes, but it does affect the economic benefits the contractor may draw from that share by conferring on the State half of the revenues stemming from oil prices in excess of USD 17 per barrel. No such Tarapoa-like clause was included in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21. This is particularly enlightening if one remembers that the PSC for Block 21 and the Tarapoa Contract were negotiated at the same time.445\n\nTr. 597:9-14 and 614:18-19.\n\n296.\n\nChristian D\u00e1valos represented Ecuador in the contemporaneous negotiations of hydrocarbons PSCs for the Tarapoa Block and Block 21. On cross-examination, Mr. D\u00e1valos confirmed that the Tarapoa Contract contained a clause that adjusted the allocation of oil revenues when the price of oil exceeded the USD 17 per barrel threshold:\n\n\" **[Mr Blackaby]:** And you [\u2026] said that a [price adjustment] clause had been included in the Tarapoa Contract; correct?\n\n**[Mr D\u00e1valos]:** I mentioned that the Tarapoa contract was being negotiated at the same time [as Block 21], and that [in] the Tarapoa Contract, at the request of the Contractor, the possibility was included for the price to be over the price that was being negotiated [as] the [\"economy\"] of the Contract. [...] They [the contractors] had agreed on $17 [per barrel as] the [\"economy\"] of the Contract [...]. So, over [USD] 17 [per barrel], they [the contractors] said okay, you can include whatever you want, and so it was decided that this be done on a 50/50 basis, this in the Tarapoa Contract \"446 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 614:16-615:20.\n\n297.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. D\u00e1valos acknowledged on cross-examination that, despite his own suggestion during the contract negotiations, no Tarapoa-like price adjustment clause was included in the PSC for Block 21:\n\n\" **[Mr Blackaby]:** When you were involved in the negotiation of Block 21, you suggested the possibility of including in the Contract a clause to have a share for the State in the event that the price of crude oil rose to 17 or $18 a barrel; correct ?\n\n**[Mr D\u00e1valos]:** Yes, sir.\n\n[....]\n\n**[Mr Blackaby]:** So, in the Block 21 Contract, the negotiating group rejected your idea of including that clause in Block 21.\n\n**[Mr D\u00e1valos]:** Yes [...] They [the contractors] said let's not talk about scenarios, scenarios that will only be scenarios\"447 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 614:10-15 and 615:21-616:7.\n\n298.\n\nBy the same token, Mr. Vega, who negotiated the Block 7 PSC on behalf of Ecuador, conceded on cross-examination that, despite his suggestion in the course of the contract negotiations, no Tarapoa-like clause was included in the PSC for Block 7:\n\n\" **[Mr Blackaby]:** You suggested, in the context of Block 7, that a correction clause be included based on the price.\n\n**[Mr Vega]:** Yes, that's right.\n\n**[Mr Blackaby]:** But at the end of the day, that wasn't done in Block 7. It was rejected by the Contractor.\n\n**[Mr Vega]:** Yes, that's right \" (emphasis added).448\n\nTr. 685:7-13.\n\n299.\n\nThese exchanges lend support to the following two propositions. First, while the Tarapoa Contract parties accepted a clause linking the distribution of oil revenues to the price of oil, the Block 7 and 21 contract parties did *not* accept such a clause. Second, the possibility of linking the distribution of oil revenues to oil prices was specifically discussed during the negotiations for the Block 7 and 21 PSCs. On the basis of these premises, it is safe to conclude that the non-inclusion of a Tarapoa-like clause in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 was not the product of inadvertence but a deliberate choice of the contracting parties.\n\n300.\n\nAs the product of a deliberate choice, the non-inclusion of an adjustment clause in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 suggests that the economy of the contracts was not a function of either oil price projections or of a specific IRR. By contrast, this choice suggests that the economy of the contract was one where the contractor was entitled to the economic value of its oil participation share without regard to either the price of oil or its IRR.\n\nd. Ecuador's conduct\n--------------------\n\n301.\n\nEcuador's conduct may also help to elucidate the meaning of the economy of the PSCs. The Tribunal will focus its attention on Ecuador's initial requests to renegotiate the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21; the deliberations relating to the passage of Law 42; and the reaction to Burlington's requests for adjustment of the \"\"x factors following the enactment of Law 42 and Decree 662.\n\n302.\n\nFirst, Ecuador invited Burlington to renegotiate the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 in November 2005.449 It alleges that, through these renegotiations, it intended to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs. However, there is no indication that Ecuador relied on the PSCs in these renegotiations or that it invoked clause 8.1 of the PSCs, which allegedly reflected the price projections upon which the parties allocated the petroleum rent.450 This suggests that Ecuador did not believe at that time in the notion of economy of the PSCs it now propounds.\n\nExh. C-173.\n\nEcuador alleged that the oil price projections that the parties would have taken into account to allocate the petroleum rent are \"reflected in the participation percentages in clauses 8 of the Participation Contracts\" (RPHB, \u00b6 43). Likewise, Ecuador maintained that the \"economy of the Participation Contracts is reflected in the participation percentages in Clause 8\" (internal quotations omitted) (*Id*., at \u00b6 73). In the same vein, Ecuador stated that the economy of the PSCs \"includes the internal rate of return for the contractor and translates into the participation percentages\" of clause 8 (*Id*., at \u00b6 105).\n\n303.\n\nSecond, following the failure of these renegotiations, the then President of Ecuador, Palacio Gonz\u00e1lez, submitted to the Ecuadorian Congress a bill that eventually became Law 42. In the course of the legislative deliberations relating to this bill, an Ecuadorian congressman expressed:\n\n\"What does this clause [from the Tarapoa PSC] say? 'If the price of crude oil in the Block exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the surplus of the benefit brought about by the price increase in real terms, calculated at constant values of 1995, will be distributed between the parties in equal shares.' Look, it's as if it were copied, that is the proposal that the Government is making, what is already envisaged in one contract [the Tarapoa contract], and we want that this, which is already envisaged in one contract, be incorporated in the rest of the envisaged in one contract, be incorporated in the rest of the contracts \"451 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-177, p. 73 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n304.\n\nAt a later stage of the deliberations, another Ecuadorian congressman added:\n\n\"By virtue of this Law [42] various [oil] contracts were renegotiated. One of the contracts that was renegotiated in the first place was [that of] the Tarapoa block, and that renegotiation was so well done that It Included [the clause] that the [first congressman] read out, by which, when the barrel of oil exceeds USD 17, [the revenues] are shared between the State and the contractor on a 50/50 basis. Then there were other renegotiations [...], and In those renegotiations, strangely, the clause that exists in the [Tarapoa] contract was not included. Now, faced with the bill sent by the President of the Republic, we have discussed whether or not we can by law unilaterally modify oil contracts with retroactive effect. That and no other is the legal issue \"452 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.,* at p. 103 (Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n305.\n\nBy calling attention to this congressional debate, the Tribunal does not intend to attribute responsibility to Ecuador for the statements of individual congressmen. However, in the overall assessment of the facts and the evidence on record, these statements shed light on the manner in which at least some members of Congress understood the context leading to the enactment of Law 42. The understanding of these congressmen was not that Law 42 gave effect to the terms of the PSCs. On the contrary, these congressmen were aware that Law 42 would modify the PSCs which included no Tarapoa-like clause like those of Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n306.\n\nThird, Burlington requested from Ecuador an upward readjustment of its participation share, or X factor, following the enactment of Law 42 and Decree 662.453 Ecuador did not respond to these requests, allegedly because Burlington had failed to submit the economic studies required for such readjustment.454 Yet, had Ecuador believed that Burlington had no right to a readjustment, it could simply have responded by stating as much. Ecuador's failure to give any answer to Burlington tends to demonstrate once again that Ecuador did not at the time embrace the notion of economy of the PSCs which it now advocates.\n\nExhs. C-11, C-12 and C-43; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 130, 311,315-320.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 174-179, 187-190 and 304\n\n307.\n\nIn sum, Ecuador's actions and omissions reveal that it did not believe in the notion of economy of the PSCs it has proffered in this arbitration. This intimates that the economy of the PSCs was not based either upon a price assumption of USD 15/bbl or upon an IRR of 15% for the contractor.\n\ne. Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law\n-----------------------------\n\n308.\n\nAs concluded in the discussion of the umbrella clause obligations, Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law contains no surviving obligation upon which Burlington may directly rely. This does not mean, however, that it is wholly without relevance in order to ascertain the scope of the contract obligations. Indeed, as Ecuador itself noted, the PSCs reproduced some of the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law on which Burlington relies. Thus, these legal provisions may shed light on the meaning of the contract by the very reason that they were to be replicated in the PSCs. Specifically, the Hydrocarbons Law may serve to establish the meaning of the \"economy\" of the contracts in the tax modification clauses.\n\n309.\n\nArticle 4 of Law No. 1993-44, which according to Ecuador contains the \"legal definition of participation contracts\",455 provides the following:\n\n\"Once production is initiated, the contractor will have the right to a share of production in the contract area, which will be calculated in accordance with the production shares offered and agreed-upon therein, based upon the volume of hydrocarbons produced. This share, valued at the selling price of hydrocarbons in the contract area, which in no case will be lower than the reference price, will constitute the contractor's gross income, from which [the contractor] will make deductions and pay income tax in accordance with the rules envisaged in the Internal Tax System Law\"456 (emphasis added).\n\nRCM, \u00b6 111.\n\nExh. C-15, p. 3 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation).\n\n310.\n\nIn accordance with this provision, the contractor's share of production constitutes its \"gross income.\"457 According to Ecuador, the contractor's share under the PSCs would be a function of oil price projections and a specific internal rate of return. The legal provision just quoted contains, however, no indication that the gross income \u2013 the equivalent of the oil participation shares \u2013 would be calculated on the basis of oil price projections or a specific internal rate of return. These indications would have been expected if they were to be replicated in the PSCs. Therefore, this provision of the Hydrocarbons Law tends to confirm that the economy of the PSCs was not a function of oil prices or an internal rate of return.\n\n*Id*. Ecuador has also argued that the PSCs did not \"limit the deductions, contributions, or taxes that could be levied or applied such as Law 42\" (Tr. 254:1-3). It is common ground that Law 42 is part of Ecuador's \"tax system\" within the meaning of the tax modification clauses. Accordingly, the Tribunal will address this argument in the context of its analysis of the tax modification clauses (*infra* section 2.4).\n\nf. The purpose of the shift to production sharing contracts\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nIn 1982, Ecuador introduced the so-called service contract model. Under this model, Ecuador reimbursed oil companies for their costs and expenses and paid a service fee. By 1993, however, the then President Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n submitted a bill to Congress where he noted that \"the current [service contract model]... has exhausted its possibilities of attracting foreign capital.\"458 In support of this conclusion, the bill stated that, \"[i]n the last five years, no contract for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons has been executed under the service contract model introduced by the reforms of 1982.\"459 The bill explained that the service contract model was on the decline for the following three main reasons:\n\n\"[1] The evolution of the international conditions of the oil industry has created more competitive models for attracting the ever scarcer available capitals, such as for instance those that are being implemented in the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. [...]\n\n[2] The Service Contract model [...] has become an extremely complicated contract in terms of management and control. On the other hand, the mandatory reimbursement provisions of the contractor's investments, costs and expenses, has significantly reduced the State's participation in the economic benefits of oil exploration and exploitation in medium-sized and small blocks.\n\n[3] Finally, the Service Contract model does not allow the contracting company to have a production flow of its own. This feature militates against the interest and *raison d'\u00eatre* of international oil companies, for most of which it is essential to be able to market [oil] production in international markets \"460 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-78, p. 3 (Claimant's translation).\n\n*Id*., at 2 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Id*., at 3-4 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n312.\n\nWith respect to the contractor's participation share, the bill, which would be passed into law and amend the Hydrocarbons Law,461 further noted that:\n\n\"With regard to the availability of production, the contractor will freely dispose of the production percentage submitted in the bidding, so that it may be traded in the domestic or external market ; but in no case may the selling price be lower than the price PetroEcuador receives for its external sales\"462 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-15.\n\nExh. C-78, at 4 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n313.\n\nWhile it is not for this Tribunal to judge what type of contract was preferable from a policy standpoint or would have brought about a fairer allocation of the oil rent, it is its role to determine the intent of the parties to the PSCs to the extent that such intent plays a role for the resolution of this Treaty claim. One of the elements that may assist in this determination concerns the reason why Ecuador abandoned the service contract in favour of the PSC.\n\n314.\n\nThe purpose of the shift from the service contract model to the production sharing model was, according to the text of the bill, to \"allow Ecuador to position itself at an internationally competitive level for attracting venture capital.\"463 It is difficult to see how a PSC could be more attractive than a service contract, knowing that the former imposes all costs, exploration and exploitation risks on the investor and the latter does not, if both models set an apparently similar maximum limit on revenues \u2013 revenues which are guaranteed under a service contract but not under a PSC.\n\n*Supra* \u00b611.\n\n315.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the economy of the PSCs was not a function of either a projected oil price of USD 15/bbl or of a contractor's IRR of 15%. Rather, the economy of the PSCs entitled the contractor to receive its oil participation share, dispose of it on the market irrespective of price, and thus to obtain its oil share's market value \u2013 subject to the applicable taxes and to the contract provisions on new taxes examined below.\n\n2.3.2. The tax modification clauses\n-----------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the tax modification clauses, which call for the application of a correction factor when the economy of the contracts is affected, are mandatory or not. Burlington claims that the tax modification clauses were mandatory and, therefore, that they amounted to tax stabilization clauses. Ecuador contends that the tax modification clauses were not mandatory and constituted mere renegotiation clauses. The Tribunal will examine each PSC separately in order to determine whether or not the application of a correction factor was mandatory.\n\na. The tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 7\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe tax modification clause included in clause 11.12 of the PSC for Block 7 provides as follows:\n\n\"Modification to the tax system: In the event of a modification to the tax system or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract or of the employment contribution, in force at the time of the execution of this Contract and as set out in this Clause, which have an impact on the economics of this Contract, a correction factor will be included in the production sharing percentages to absorb the impact of the increase or decrease in the tax or in the employment contribution burden. This correction factor will be calculated between the Parties and will be subject to the procedure set forth in Article thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for Application of the Law Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law\"464 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-1, clause 11.12 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n318.\n\nThis clause must be interpreted in conjunction with clauses 8.6 and 15.2 of the Contract. Clause 8.6 states:\n\n\"Economic stability: In the event that, by the action of the Ecuadorian State or PetroEcuador, any of the events described below were to occur and have an impact on the economy of this Contract, a correction factor will be applied to the production sharing percentages in order to absorb the increase or decrease in the economic burden: a) Modification of the tax system as described in clause [11.12] [\u2026]\"465 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id*., at clause 8.6 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n319.\n\nClause 15.2 in turn provides that:\n\n\"Contract amendments: There shall be negotiation and execution of contract amendments, with prior agreement of the Parties, particularly in the following cases:[...] c) When the tax system [...] applicable to this type of Contract in the country is modified, in order to restore the economy of the Contract in accordance with clause [11.12466]\"467 (emphasis added).\n\nClause 15.2(c) in fact refers to clause 11.11 \u2013 not to clause 11.12. As Ecuador's reliance on this clause indicates, this is a mistake. Clause 11.11 refers to the \"amortization of investments\" and not to modifications to the tax system, which is what clause 15.2(c) addresses. Thus, it is to be understood that the reference in clause 15.2(c) to clause 11.11 was intended to be a reference to clause 11.12.\n\nExh. C-1, at clause 15.2 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n320.\n\nIn order to determine whether the application of a correction factor is mandatory or not, the Tribunal will examine the language of these clauses, their purpose, and the relevant provision of the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework which these clauses are meant to replicate, that is, Article 16 of Decree No. 1417.\n\n321.\n\nFirst, all the three provisions transcribed above contain mandatory language calling for the parties to apply a correction factor in order to absorb the impact of a tax increase or decrease on the economy of the Contract. Under clause 11.12, a correction factor will be included if there is a modification to the tax system which has an impact on the economy of the Contract; under clause 8.6, a correction factor will apply if there is a modification to the tax system which has an impact on the economy of the Contract; under clause 15.2, if there is a modification to the tax system, the parties shall negotiate and execute a contract amendment with a view to re-establishing the economy of the Contract. Those formulations show that the application of a correction factor is not optional. In the event of a modification to the tax system impacting the economy of the Contract, there must be a correction.\n\n322.\n\nAt the same time, both parties to the PSC are to agree on the implementation of this correction factor. According to clause 11.12, the correction factor \"will be calculated between the Parties.\" According to clause 15.2(c), a contract amendment for the application of such correction factor shall be negotiated and executed \"with prior agreement of the Parties.\" In the Tribunal's reading, this requirement does not make the application of a correction factor optional. Otherwise, the content of the clause would be inherently contradictory, with mandatory language being followed in short order by contrary optional language.\n\n323.\n\nThe provision that the parties must jointly calculate the readjustment does not address *whether* a correction factor will be applied. The contract already provides that such a factor \"will be included\" for the purpose of absorbing the impact of the tax. Rather, this provision assists in determining *how* the correction factor will be calculated. The apparent purpose of this provision is to prevent a situation where a party unilaterally imposes its computation of the share of oil production needed to offset the effect of a tax increase or decrease, an admittedly complex calculation.468 This joint calculation notwithstanding, the parties remain under an obligation to apply a correction factor that will counterbalance the effects of a tax change on the economy of the contract.\n\nAt the hearing, counsel for Ecuador stated that \"if the economy of the Participation Contract was affected, the Parties need to negotiate, among others, how the different factors, X-factors in this clause [8.1] should be adjusted. And as I said to you, these negotiations are very complex \" (emphasis added) (Tr. 261:13-17).\n\n324.\n\nSecond, pursuant to the relevant clauses, the purpose of the correction factor is \"to absorb the impact of the increase or decrease in the ta\"x469 and \"to restore the economy of the Contract.\"470 The purpose is to avoid that tax increases or decreases alter the economic foundation upon which the parties entered into the contract.471 This purpose would be defeated if a party could simply refuse to apply a correction factor in the event of a tax increase or decrease. Hence, the purpose of the tax modification clause suggests that the parties intended the application of a correction factor to be mandatory.\n\nExh. C-1, at clauses 11.2 and 8.6.\n\n*Id*., at clause 15.2 (Tribunal's translation).\n\nAt the hearing, counsel for Burlington indicated that the right to a share of oil production \"in itself [] could be meaningless because if the State did not provide protection against changes in a tax and royalty regime, the State could simply neutralize the income realizable from a share in production at will\" (Tr. 29:2-8).\n\n325.\n\nFinally, this interpretation finds confirmation in the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework. As Ecuador itself recognizes,472 the tax modification clause of the PSCs reflects the content of Article 16 of Decree No. 1417, which states:\n\n\"Economic stability: The parties' production shares in the contract area will be adjusted when the tax system applicable to the contract has been modified, in order to restore the economics of the contract in place before the tax modification\"473 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 208:12-22.\n\nExh. C-89, p. 23 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation).\n\n326.\n\nThe language of this provision is also mandatory: the parties' oil production shares \"will be adjusted\" in the event of a change in the tax system. And the purpose of the adjustment is to \"restore the economics of the contract in place before the tax modification.\" Thus, Article 16 provides for a mandatory adjustment clause to be inserted into production sharing contracts.\n\n327.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is of the view that the tax modification provision contained in clause 11.12 of the PSC for Block 7 calls for the application of a mandatory correction factor that absorbs any impact of a tax increase or decrease on the economy of the Contract.\n\nb. The tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21 is set forth in clause 11.7:\n\n\"Modification to the tax system and to the employment contribution: In the event of a modification to the tax system, the employment contribution or its interpretation, which have an impact on the economics of this Contract, a correction factor will be included in the production sharing percentages to absorb the increase or decrease in the tax. This adjustment will be approved by the Administrative Board on the basis of a study that the Contractor will present to that effect \"474 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-2, at clause 11.7 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n329.\n\nIn addition, clause 15.2 of the PSC for Block 21 provides as follows:\n\n\"Contract amendments: There shall be negotiation and execution of contract amendments, with prior agreement of the Parties, particularly in the following cases:[...] c) When the tax system [...] applicable to this type of Contract in the country is modified, in order to restore the economy of the Contract [...]\"475 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.,* at clause 15.2 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n330.\n\nAs with the analysis of the tax modification clause in the PSC for Block 7, the Tribunal will focus on the language, the purpose and the relevant part of the Hydrocarbons Legal Framework.\n\n331.\n\nFirst, clause 11.7, first sentence, provides that a correction factor \"will be included\" in the event of a modification to the tax system. In addition, the second sentence of this clause states that this adjustment \"will be approved\" by the Administrative Board (\"the Board\"). This approval requirement means that the Board may verify and eventually suggest modifications to the correction factor proposed by the contractor. However, the Board has no discretion to refuse the application of a correction factor, which \"will be included.\" Clause 15.2, in turn, stipulates that a contract amendment \"shall\" be negotiated and executed in order to restore the economy of the contract in the event of a tax change. Like for the PSC for Block 7, this language suggests that the application of a correction factor is mandatory.\n\n332.\n\nSecond, the purpose of the application of this correction factor is \"to absorb the increase or decrease in the ta\"x476 in order \"to restore the economy of the Contract.\"477 This purpose would be defeated if a party could simply refuse to apply a correction factor. While the computations required for the application of the correction factor are subject to the \"prior agreement of the Parties\",478 this does not mean that the application of a correction factor is optional. As Mr. D\u00e1valos, Ecuador's head negotiator for the Block 21 PSC, acknowledged on examination by the Tribunal, \"if the [p]arties do not agree on a correction factor\", this disagreement \"could be subject to international arbitration\", *i.e.* resolved by a third-party adjudicator.479\n\n*Id.*, at clause 11.7 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Id.*, at clause 15.2 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Id*.\n\nTr. 640:12-15.\n\n333.\n\nAll in all, both the language and the purpose of these contractual provisions show that the tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21 is mandatory. This conclusion is confirmed by Article 16 of Decree No. 1417, reproduced in the tax modification of the PSC for Block 21, the language of which calls for the mandatory adjustment of the parties' oil production shares \"in order to restore the economics of the contract in place before the tax modification.\"480\n\nExh. C-89, p. 23 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation).\n\n334.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal deems that the application of a correction factor is mandatory when a tax affects the economy of the PSCs for Blocks 7 or 21. This correction factor must be of such extent as to wipe out the effects of the tax on the economy of the PSC. Otherwise stated, the correction factor must restore the economy of the PSC to its pre-tax modification level.\n\n335.\n\nIn conclusion, and for the sole purpose of the resolution of the Treaty claim before it, the Tribunal considers that the PSCs provided for the following rights: (i) the right to receive and sell the contractor's share of oil production irrespective of the price of oil and its internal rate of return, subject to the payment of the taxes and employment contributions specified in the PSCs; and (ii) the right to the application of a mechanism that would absorb the effects of any tax increase affecting the economy of the PSCs, *i.e.* a right to tax absorption under certain conditions.481\n\nThe term tax absorption clause hereinafter supersedes the locutions \"tax indemnification clause\" (DJ, \u00b6 18 n. 1) and \"tax modification clause\" (*supra* \u00b6\u00b6 21-22) previously employed to refer to these clauses.\n\n3. Did Ecuador Expropriate Burlington's Investment?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1. What is the proper approach to examine Burlington's expropriation claim?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the approach which the Tribunal should adopt to analyze Burlington's expropriation claim. While it argues that the measures are expropriatory whether taken separately or together, Burlington favors a creeping expropriation approach. By contrast, Ecuador alleges that the Tribunal must first determine whether Law 42 is expropriatory or not. The Tribunal must therefore determine under which approach it must review Burlington's expropriation claim.\n\n3.1.1. Positions of the Parties\n-------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nBurlington alleges that Ecuador expropriated its investment through the following series of measures: (i) the enactment of Law 42 (initially at the 50% rate and subsequently at the 99% rate); (ii) the initiation of *coactiva* proceedings, which lead to the seizure and auction of Burlington's share of oil production; (iii) the physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21; and (iv) the termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 through the *caducidad* process.482 Burlington maintains that these measures constituted an unlawful expropriation of its investment \"both individually and in the aggregate.\"483\n\nCSM, \u00b6 80.\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 86, 98.\n\n338.\n\nAt the hearing and in its post-hearing brief, Burlington stressed that Ecuador's measures, taken collectively, constituted a creeping expropriation of its investment.484 Burlington relied on the definition of creeping expropriation adopted in *Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine* :\n\n\"Creeping expropriation is a form of indirect expropriation with a distinctive temporal quality in the sense that it encapsulates the situation whereby a series of acts attributable to the State over a period of time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such property\"485 (emphasis in original).\n\nTr. 70:7-12, 73:16-22, 81:9-14, 110:10-15,\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine*, Award of 15 September 2003, at \u00b6 20-22 (Exh. CL-145); Tr. 74:7-14.\n\n339.\n\nWithout a creeping expropriation approach, \"Ecuador will receive a discount for having destroyed much of the value of [Burlington's] investment prior to the physical takeover [of the Blocks].\"486 This would create \"perverse incentives\" that would reward a State \"for measures that it takes to progressively diminish the value and rights underlying an asset prior to the final step in the expropriation.\"487 As a result, \"[u]nder international law, the Tribunal should consider the acts of Ecuador in the aggregate and judge the final toll on the Claimants' investments based on all the measures.\"488 In brief, Burlington favors a creeping expropriation approach over a step-by-step approach.489\n\nTr. 75:14-18.\n\nTr. 74:15-19,\n\nTr. 1264:21-1265:2.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 55-59.\n\n340.\n\nEcuador argues that Burlington's case \"has evolved at [the] hearing.\"490 Prior to the hearing, Burlington's case was that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to expropriation \u2013 an indirect expropriation \u2013 and that the *coactiva* seizures and the takeover of the Blocks constituted a direct expropriation. In a nutshell, Burlington's case was one of indirect and direct expropriation. Yet, for Ecuador, Burlington \"radically changed its case\" at the hearing and adopted a new creeping expropriation theory in lieu of the expropriation theories it previously advocated.491 For this reason, Ecuador has \"reserve[d] all its rights in this regard.\"492 In any event, Ecuador contends that Burlington's creeping expropriation theory is wrong because Law 42 was the initial cause of the subsequent chain of events:\n\n\"We cannot analyze this very case as a creeping expropriation case. This is intellectually incorrect. And it's intellectually incorrect because here what we have is different events that are related in a cause-effect relationship.493 [...] The facts of this case happened in a way that Law 42 should be the cause of the rest of the events, so any theory on cumulative events going towards something is simply against simple logic.494\n\n[...]\n\nBurlington's cumulative indirect [creeping] expropriation case is nonsense, in our opinion. It is a question of logic. The Tribunal cannot overlook the cause-effect relationship between Law 42, the *coactiva*, the abandonment of the fields, and the declaration of *caducidad*. You need to deal with the first event, which is Law 42, and the effects of Law 42 on the economics of the deal between the Contractor and Ecuador.\"495\n\nTr. 217:3-4.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 5.\n\n*Id*.\n\nTr. 1343:1-6.\n\nTr. 217:9-13.\n\nTr. 246:5-13.\n\n341.\n\nEcuador further asserts that \"Law 42 [was] not an internationally wrongful act.\"496 Law 42 did not modify or breach the PSCs. Thus, \"Burlington had to comply with [Law 42].\"497 It was Burlington's failure to comply with Law 42 that set in motion the remaining events of the case: \"[T]he subsequent events of this case, the *coactiva*, the abandonment of the fields by the Consortium, and the declaration of *caducidad*, are consequences of [...] [Burlington's] breach of both Ecuadorian law and the [PSCs] for Blocks 7 and 21.\"498 In short, a proper analysis of Burlington's expropriation claim must begin with Law 42 and a cumulative approach is inapposite under the facts of this case.\n\nTr. 217:16-18.\n\nTr. 217:18.\n\nTr. 217:18-218:2.\n\n3.1.2. Analysis\n---------------\n\n342.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal wishes to address Ecuador's allegation that Burlington \"radically changed\"499 its case at the hearing by endorsing a creeping expropriation theory. According to Ecuador, Burlington \"brought up an entirely new case premised on a 'creeping expropriation' theory.\"500 While Burlington did place greater emphasis on a creeping expropriation theory from the hearing onwards, the record does not support Ecuador's allegation that this was a \"new\" theory. Already in the Supplemental Memorial on Liability, Burlington alleged that Ecuador's measures \"both individually *and in the aggregate* \"501 (emphasis added) constituted an expropriation of its investment. Burlington's reference to measures \"in the aggregate\" encompasses, albeit with a different label, the creeping expropriation theory favored from the hearing on.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 5.\n\n*Id*.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 80 (with similar allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 98).\n\n343.\n\nIn its post-hearing brief, Burlington continued to allege that Ecuador's measures individually, and all of them collectively, were expropriatory \u2013 again, as at the hearing, with an emphasis on a collective approach. Hence, while Burlington shifted the emphasis of its case, it does not appear that it has changed its case at the hearing.502 Furthermore, Ecuador has had the opportunity to refute Burlington's creeping expropriation theory and has in fact availed itself of such opportunity.503\n\n*E.g.* COSS, Expropriation Part, ## 45 ff.; Tr. 73:6-110:6.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 481-493.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn its attention to the two competing analytic approaches according to which it is possible to examine Burlington's expropriation claims. Under the individualized approach, the evidence of an expropriation is examined measure-by-measure while under a collective approach all measures are considered together.\n\n345.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, when the investor puts forward both an individualized and a collective case of expropriation, one should begin the analysis with the measure-bymeasure approach; the reason being that a collective or creeping approach is typically employed only when no single measure is in itself expropriatory. This proposition finds supports both in literature and in previous cases. Michael Reisman and Robert Sloane, for instance, approvingly refer to an arbitrator's view to the effect that \"a creeping expropriation is comprised of a number of elements, *none of which can \u2013 separately \u2013 constitute the international wrong* \"504 (emphasis added). By contrast, these authors note that \"if one or two events in [a] series [of measures] can readily be identified as those that destroyed the investment's value, then to speak of a creeping expropriation may be misleading.\"505\n\nW. Michael Reisman & Robert D. Sloane, *Indirect Expropriation and Its Valuation in the BIT Generation*, 74 THE BRITISH YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 115, (2004), at 123 in the original pagination, quoting the dissenting opinion of Keith Highet in *Waste Management v. Mexico*, Award of 2 June 2000 (Exh. CL-177).\n\n*Id*..\n\n346.\n\nArbitral awards confirm this view. In *Vivendi II*, upon which Burlington has heavily relied, the tribunal stated that \"[i]t is well-established under international law that *even if* a single act or omission by a government may not constitute a violation of an international obligation, several acts taken together can\"506 (emphasis added). The term \"even if\" implies that the collective approach is to be applied only after an individualized analysis has resulted in a finding of no expropriation. The tribunal in *Santa Elena* made the point even more explicitly when it held, in a passage quoted in *Vivendi II*, that \"a measure or series of measures *can still eventually amount to a taking*, though the individual steps in the process do not [...]\"507 (emphasis added).\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, (hereinafter \" *Vivendi II* \"), Award of 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.5.31 (Exh. CL-123).\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Costa Rica*, Award of 17 February 2000, \u00b6 76 (Exh. CL-175).\n\n347.\n\nFinally, Burlington has submitted that \"[i]t is well established under international law that tribunals must assess whether the cumulative effect of measures constitute an expropriation.\"508 At the same time, Burlington has admitted that, when it is simultaneously argued that \"each and every measure analyzed individually constitute[s] an expropriation\",509 a focus on the cumulative effect of measures is but a \"possibility.\"510 In other words, Burlington has *not* submitted that, when both an individualized and a collective approach to expropriation are advanced, the collective approach *must* be adopted first.511\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 57.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 121.\n\n*Id*.\n\nBurlington has made the argument that \"a State should not be rewarded for measures that it takes to progressively diminish the value and rights underlying an asset prior to the final step in the expropriation.\" (Tr. 74:15-19). However, this argument does not assist in the determination of whether an individualized or a creeping approach should initially be adopted; rather, it may help for *quantum* purposes in case a creeping approach were finally adopted.\n\n348.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will first analyze each of the challenged measures individually. In particular, the Tribunal will successively examine (i) Law 42 (both at 50% and 99%), (ii) the *coactiva* proceedings, (iii) the physical occupation of the Blocks, and (iv) the *caducidad* decrees. In the event that none of these measures individually were found to be expropriatory, it would then consider their cumulative effect.\n\n3.2. Were the application of Law 42 and the failure to absorb its effects measures tantamount to expropriation?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether Law 42 and Ecuador's subsequent failure to absorb its effects was a measure tantamount to expropriation at the rate of 50% and 99%.\n\n3.2.1. Burlington's position\n----------------------------\n\n350.\n\nBurlington argues that Law 42, together with Ecuador's failure to absorb its effects, was \"a measure tantamount to expropriation.\"512 In other words, Law 42 had the effects of an expropriation. Law 42 transferred virtually all of Burlington's revenues to Ecuador.513 Thus, Law 42 permanently deprived Burlington of practically all of the profit to which it was entitled under the PSCs.514 By way of example, in July 2008, the price of Napo crude oil was over USD 122 per barrel. Under Law 42 at 99%, Burlington had to pay to Ecuador over USD 107 per barrel. By 2008 Burlington was operating at a loss. Hence, Law 42 has substantially deprived Burlington of its revenue and expropriated its investment.515\n\nCSM, \u00b6 82.\n\nMem., \u00b6 432.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 82.\n\nMem., \u00b6 432.\n\n351.\n\nMore specifically, a State's power to tax may devolve into the power to destroy. As Ian Brownlie wrote, \"[t]axation which has the precise object and effect of confiscation is unlawful.\"516 Although the Treaty does not define the term expropriation, it recognizes the possibility that a tax may be expropriatory. Any government measure which results in a substantial deprivation of an investor's property is a taking.517 Whether a tax causes a substantial deprivation and is thus expropriatory is ultimately a fact-specific question.518\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 187; Exh. CL-105.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 82; Mem., \u00b6 441.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 189.\n\n352.\n\nThere is no basis for arguing, as Ecuador does, that under the Treaty a tax is expropriatory only if (i) it is discriminatory, and (ii) intended to confiscate property rights \u2013 a test based on the Restatement of the Law (Third) of Foreign Relations of the United States.519 At the same time, Burlington conceded at the hearing that it did \"not object to that [Restatement] standard.\"520 It added that if this standard were applied, it would be met in this case.521\n\nTr. 1269:19-1270:6\n\n*Id.*\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 190-195.\n\n353.\n\nFurthermore, a tax that is contrary to a tax stabilization provision is expropriatory: \"[i]t is clear that a tax measure will make the leap from a *bona fide* [g]overnment regulation to an expropriatory measure when the tax measure violates specific commitments [made to] a foreign investor.\"522 In support of this proposition, Burlington relies on the decisions in *Revere Copper*, *Benvenuti*, and *Methanex*, which held that tax measures can effect a taking if they impair contract rights.\n\nTr. 1266:10-13.\n\n354.\n\nIn this case, the purpose of Law 42 was to force Burlington to abdicate its rights under the PSCs. There is ample evidence to this effect. President Correa characterized Law 42 as a \"pressuring measure\"523 that would prompt oil companies to \"sit down to negotiate.\"524 Furthermore, in a public radio address, President Correa stated that oil companies had the following \"three options\"525: (i) continue paying the 99% tax, (ii) renegotiate the contract into a service contract, or (iii) receive the sunk costs of the investments and leave the country.526 That this was the purpose of Law 42 was also confirmed by Celio Vega at the hearing:\n\n\"But when the State calls on companies to renegotiate [the PSCs], the companies don't heed the call. They don't sit down to negotiate because they obviously wanted to continue taking in those high profits. And so the State basically felt obligated to issue Law 42, and the contractors at that moment just at that point realized they needed to negotiate with the State [...]. Some did not sit down to negotiate, and well, you know better than me what happened there.\"527 (Burlington's emphasis).\n\nExh. C-182; CSM, \u00b6 28.\n\n*Id*.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 231, 416.\n\n*Id*.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 77 Tr. 695:18-696:7.\n\n355.\n\nIn carrying out this purpose, Ecuador stepped out of its role as an ordinary commercial partner, using its sovereign power to contravene the specific commitments it had made to Burlington and, in particular, the tax stabilization clauses contained in the PSCs. These clauses were \"crucial [...] as an inducement to long-term investment\"528 because they ensured that the value of the contractor's share of oil would not be \"eroded by future Government action [\u2026].\"529 They required Ecuador to adjust the contractor's share of oil production in order to absorb the effects of tax increases having an impact on the economy of the PSCs.\n\nMem., \u00b6 69.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 309.\n\n356.\n\nHowever, when Law 42 was passed and Burlington requested a readjustment of its share of oil pursuant to the PSCs, Ecuador ignored these requests. This was no accident but the fruition of the purpose of Law 42. Compliance with the tax stabilization clauses would have been incompatible with Ecuador's goal of unilaterally changing the economic terms of the PSCs.530 Thus, in passing Law 42 and then ignoring the requests for readjustment, Ecuador extinguished Burlington's right to the participation share to which it was entitled under the PSCs.531 In this way, Ecuador effected a taking of Burlington's contract rights, a conclusion that finds support in the *Revere* *Copper* and *Benvenuti* decisions, where the tribunals held that tax measures that impair contract rights can effect a taking.532\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 82.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 128-130.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 127.\n\n357.\n\nContrary to what Ecuador claims, the goal of Law 42 was *not* to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs.533 First, Ecuador conducted no analysis of each individual PSC in order to determine what its equilibrium point was, an exercise that would have been required taking into account that the different PSCs were \"all signed at different moments in time and had different production levels and different reference prices [\u2026].\"534 In these circumstances, a general across the board measure could not have served to re-establish an equilibrium point that had not been established in the first place. Second, Ecuador imposed three different tax rates: 50, 99 and 70. This is strong evidence that the goal of this tax was not to re-establish the economic equilibrium of the PSCs. Upon examination by the Tribunal, Mr. Vega conceded that \"a fixed percentage may be able to re-establish [the] equilibrium [point] for some contracts and not for others.\"535\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 201, 220-223.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 221.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 223 (quoting from Tr. 700:12-19).\n\n358.\n\nAlthough Ecuador denies relying on the *rebus sic stantibus* principle (or *th\u00e9orie de l'impr\u00e9vision*), its own submissions and the expert evidence refer to the requirements underlying this principle.536 The party invoking the *clausula rebus sic stantibus* must show that (i) an extraordinary and unforeseeable or unforeseen event caused an imbalance in the obligations of the parties; (ii) this imbalance must be such that performance of the contract would be too burdensome for one of the parties; and (iii) the event causing the imbalance should not be a consequence of actions or omissions of the party invoking the principle. Ecuador, however, cannot meet the first two requirements of the *rebus sic stantibus* principle.537\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 201.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 204.\n\n359.\n\nEven before the enactment of Law 42, Ecuador was receiving the majority of the benefits of the oil production. Ecuador claims that it enacted Law 42 because the oil companies \"were even benefitting *more* than Ecuador from the surge of oil prices\"538 (emphasis in original). This is incorrect as a matter of fact. With respect to Block 7, Ecuador received a total take on oil revenues of 51.1 percent, whereas the Consortium's share of oil production was 38.3 percent and its operating costs 10.6 percent.539 With respect to Block 21, Ecuador's total take on oil revenues was 42.6 percent; whereas the Consortium's share was 48.6 percent and its operating costs 8.8 percent.540\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 205 (quoting from RCM, \u00b6 440).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 206-207.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 208.\n\n360.\n\nFurthermore, the increase in oil prices was foreseeable.541 The parties foresaw the possibility that oil prices could increase and discussed the possibility of including a price adjustment clause. Such a clause was included in the Tarapoa Contract, where the parties agreed that oil revenues resulting from oil prices in excess of USD 17 per barrel would be shared on a 50/50 basis.542 Ecuador secured this clause in the Tarapoa negotiations because it offered in return \"an extension of the term of the contract in relation to a highly profitable and productive Block.\"543 In this case, however, a Tarapoa-like clause was discussed and rejected, as documented in Annex V of the PSC for Block 7:\n\n\"As an alternative, it was proposed that an average of USD 17 per barrel be set, with the parties equitably sharing the surplus at 50% each. This proposal was not accepted by the [contractor] either [...].\"544\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 209-210.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 210.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 211.\n\nExh. C-1, Annex V, at p. 005153 in the original pagination (Tribunal's translation); Mem., \u00b6 102.\n\n361.\n\nContrary to Ecuador's allegation, the magnitude of the price increase was also foreseeable. Ecuador's view is belied by the evolution of oil prices in the twenty-year period preceding the conclusion of the PSCs. Since the term of the PSCs was twenty years, it was logical to look at the evolution of oil prices over the twenty-year period *prior* to the conclusion of the PSCs. This evolution shows that crude oil prices experienced the same type of increase in the 70s as they did in the years 2000, *i.e.* over USD 100 per barrel in real terms.545\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 213.\n\n362.\n\nFinally, the oil price increase did not render the performance of the PSCs more burdensome for Ecuador. On the contrary, Ecuador was receiving more benefits from the PSCs than expected at the time when the contracts were executed. Ecuador's participation share was more valuable than expected and it was receiving higher income taxes than anticipated. As a result, Ecuador has not met the requirements to invoke the doctrine of *rebus sic stantibus*. Furthermore, it is doubtful that the PSCs are public service contracts entitled to the protection of this doctrine in the first place. But even if they were, Ecuador has failed to meet the relevant requirements.\n\n363.\n\nMoreover, Ecuador's allegation that Burlington refused to renegotiate in good faith is untrue.546 The reason why Burlington was ultimately unable to accept Ecuador's renegotiation proposals is that they were unreasonable, as they required Burlington to abandon its rights under the PSCs without even knowing what it would receive in return.547 In March 2008, after the opening of renegotiations two months earlier, Burlington was evaluating a Draft Partial Agreement that contemplated continuing operations under the PSCs for up to five years, a proposal that was \"particularly interesting\"548 for Block 7. However, President Correa suddenly announced that Ecuador \"could do better\"549, and Ecuador submitted a new draft agreement which called for a migration to an undetermined service contract within 120 days. Burlington could not agree to this proposal or to the similar proposal that ensued, and legitimately stood on its rights.550\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 227.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 228 n. 300.\n\nExh. C-184; CPHB, \u00b6 229.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 87, 93.\n\n364.\n\nEcuador portrays Burlington as an unreasonable partner because almost all other companies renegotiated their PSCs. This allegation is disingenuous.551 Most investors commenced arbitration proceedings against Ecuador following the enactment of Law 42, including Petrobras, Repsol, City Oriente, Murphy, and Perenco.552 Of the fourteen PSCs in effect when Law 42 was enacted, only four were successfully converted into service contracts. Most companies either settled their claims or signed transitory agreements but no service contracts.553 At the end of the day, Ecuador successfully renegotiated PSCs into service contracts with only two consortia out of ten.554\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 237.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 239.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 240.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 244.\n\n365.\n\nWith respect to the standard for expropriation, Ecuador wrongly argues that Law 42 is entitled to a presumption that it is a *bona fide* taxation measure under international law.555 If a tax measure were entitled to a presumption of validity, Article X would have stated so.556 By contrast, Article X makes clear that a tax may be expropriatory. Thus, tax measures are entitled to no special deference under the Treaty. Similarly, there is no basis for Ecuador's claim that there is expropriation only if (i) the State intends that the tax be expropriatory, and (ii) the tax is discriminatory. Because the Treaty provides no definition of expropriation, the inquiry is a fact specific one.557\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 185.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 188.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 188-189, 200.\n\n366.\n\nAt any rate, the tax measures would be expropriatory even under Ecuador's own standard. The evidence shows that the purpose behind Law 42 was expropriatory, for it was intended to force Burlington and other investors to surrender their rights under the PSCs. Law 42 was also discriminatory because a lower 70% tax rate would apply to those who signed a transitory agreement, as opposed to the higher 99% tax rate applicable to others. Ecuador also relies on *EnCana v. Ecuador* for the proposition that a tax is expropriatory only if it is \"extraordinary, punitive in amount or arbitrary.\"558 The evidence shows that this standard is met. President Correa himself called Law 42 at the 99% rate \"an exaggeration.\"559 Fair Links, for its part, conceded on crossexamination that no other country had enacted measures as severe as Law 42 at the 99% rate.560\n\nExh. EL-45, \u00b6 177; CPHB, \u00b6 195.\n\nExh. C-179 (Claimant's translation); Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 223, 350; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 79, 148, 152 and 195..\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 195.\n\n367.\n\nLaw 42 at the 50% rate had a devastating impact on Burlington's investment.561 First, it prevented Burlington from recovering past investments, as 2006 was the year in which it would begin to recoup those investments.562 Second, it forced Burlington to scale back its development plans, thereby diminishing its ability to exploit the Blocks during the contract term.563 Third, Burlington submitted the Oso Plan despite Law 42 at 50% because the PSC for Block 7 was to expire in 2010, thus leaving a \"short time frame to develop the reserves available.\"564 Fourth, Block 21 was no longer viable with Law 42 at the 50% rate. At that point, Block 7 \"carried the Consortium.\"565 Finally, as illustrated below, Law 42 at 50% had a significant impact on Burlington's total take on oil revenues.566\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 162.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 163.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 165-168.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 167 (quoting from Tr. 356:15-16; Burlington's emphasis omitted.)\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 171 (quoting from Tr. 544:5-6).\n\nThe \"total take\" includes taxes and other mandatory contributions.\n\n368.\n\nLaw 42 at the 99% rate destroyed the value of Burlington's investment.567 First, the financial statements show that in 2008 Burlington sustained a loss of slightly over USD 60 million in Blocks 7 and 21. Although both Blocks sustained losses, the impact on Block 7 was of lesser magnitude.568 Second, the Consortium did not undertake any new investment, not even in the Oso field.569 Finally, as the graph below shows, Law 42 at 99% destroyed the value of Burlington's investment. It turned the operation of the Blocks \"into a form of subsistence farming, hand-to-mouth, day-to-day operation, no capital expenditure, trying to deal with past CAPEX [capital expenditures].\"570\n\nCPHB, at \u00b6 173.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 175.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 176.\n\nTr. 45:21-46:3.\n\n369.\n\nThe following graph shows the effects of Law 42 on Block 7 at both the 50% and 99% rates:571\n\nCPHB, at \u00b6 207\n\n370.\n\nLikewise, the graph below shows the effects of Law 42 on Block 21 at both the 50% and 99% rates:572\n\n371Finally, the Fair Links analysis about the impact of Law 42 is flawed. First, Fair Links improperly excluded from its analysis the Consortium's capital expenditures \u2013 USD 60 million worth of past investments.573 Second, Fair Links gave an inaccurate version of the Consortium's IRR because (i) it considered outdated cost projections instead of actual costs, and (ii) it undervalued the magnitude of the Consortium's investment. Finally, Fair Links provided an inaccurate picture of the Consortium's profitability as it did not consider (i) the time value of money, (ii) the deterrent effect of Law 42, and (ii) a cash flow analysis for the entire life of the PSCs instead of one ending in July 2009.574\n\n372For these reasons, Burlington submits that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to expropriation both at the 50% and at the 99% rates.\n\nCPHB, at \u00b6 208\n\nCPHB, at \u00b6\u00b6 178-180.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 177-184.\n\n3.2.2. Ecuador's position\n-------------------------\n\n373.\n\nEcuador argues that Law 42 did not expropriate Burlington's investment, be it at the 50% rate or at the 99% rate. On the contrary, Law 42 was a legitimate and *bona fide* exercise of Ecuador's police powers.575\n\nRCM, \u00b6 392.\n\n374.\n\nTaxation is part of the State's regulatory powers and in principle does not give rise to a duty to compensate as a matter of public international law. Ecuador refers to Ian Brownlie's observation that, absent special facts, tax measures are in principle \"not unlawful and do not constitute expropriation.\"576 In conformity with this principle, the tribunals in *Saluka, Sedco*, *Tecmed* and *Telenor* stated that the State was not liable for economic injury resulting from the exercise of its regulatory powers. Taxation is one of the most important aspects of the State's sovereign powers;577 as such, it is in a \"special category\" with respect to expropriation claims.578\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 404-405; Exh. EL-121, p. 509 in original pagination.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 412-413.\n\nTr. 226:6-7.\n\n375.\n\nBecause taxes are in a special category, only in exceptional circumstances will a tax be expropriatory. Case law and doctrinal writings suggest that a tax measure may be tantamount to expropriation if (i) it produces the effects required for any indirect expropriation and (ii) in addition, it is discriminatory, arbitrary, involves a denial of due process or an abuse of rights. Thus, in *EnCana*, the tribunal held that \"[o]nly if a tax is extraordinary, punitive in amount or arbitrary in its incidence would issues of indirect expropriation be raised.\"579 In short, only in \"extreme\" cases will a tax be expropriatory.580\n\nRCM, \u00b6 416; Exh. EL-45, \u00b6 177.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 421; Exh. EL-45, \u00b6 173.\n\n376.\n\nUnder the Restatement of the Law (Third) of Foreign Relations of the United States, a tax will be \"extreme\" and thus expropriatory only if it is \"discriminatory [and] designed to cause the alien to abandon the property to the state or sell it at a distress price.\"581 Expressly invoking this principle, the tribunal in *Emanuel Too v. Greater Modesto* held that the seizure of the claimant's liquor license, home and bank account for failure to pay tax obligations was not expropriatory.582 Similarly, in *Paushok v. Mongolia*, the tribunal stated that an investor had no immunity from windfall profit taxes in the absence of a tax stabilization clause.583\n\nExh. EL-164; ROSS, # 84.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 427; *Emanuel Too v. Greater Modesto Insurance Associates and the United States of America*, Iran \u2013 United States Claims Tribunal, Award of 29 December 1989 (Exh. EL-114 at \u00b6 26). The Respondent has also relied on the decision in *Feldman* for the proposition that a tax measure is not expropriatory unless it entails an \"unreasonable interference with an alien's property.\" Under this test, the tribunal found that there was no expropriation (*Feldman* Award, at \u00b6 106. Exh. EL-80).\n\nBecause this decision was made on 28 April 2011, it was not fully available at the time Ecuador submitted its Post-Hearing Brief on Liability. However, Ecuador has relied on reports of the case.\n\n377.\n\nLaw 42 was a necessary and appropriate measure under the circumstances. As of 2002, there was an unprecedented and unforeseen rise of oil prices. This unforeseen increase in the price of oil destroyed the economic equilibrium of the PSCs. This economic equilibrium must reflect the oil industry's widely accepted assumption that the State, as the owner of the non-renewable resource, \"is to be the main beneficiary of extra revenue resulting from high oil prices.\"584 However, the PSCs have limited price elasticity, *i.e.* the State's participation share remains the same even though prices increase. With the massive and unforeseen increase of oil prices, Ecuador was no longer the main beneficiary of the oil revenues. As a result, the PSCs no longer reflected a fair division of extractive oil rent between the State and the contractor.585\n\nRCM, \u00b6 188.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 171-188.\n\n378.\n\nEcuador's adoption of Law 42 was unexceptional. Since 2002, as many as sixteen States have adopted measures similar to Law 42 in the wake of soaring oil prices, including countries such as the United Kingdom and Norway.586 In particular, ConocoPhillips, Burlington's parent company, has likely been subject to measures similar to Law 42 in various other States, such as Algeria, China or Alaska. Thus, Ecuador's attempt to restore the economy of the PSCs was in accordance with industry practice. Initially, Ecuador sought to restore the economy of the PSCs through negotiations.587 But Burlington obstinately refused to do so, even though it was under a good faith duty to renegotiate in light of the changed circumstances.588 Faced with Burlington's intransigence, Ecuador had a constitutional duty to pass Law 42, which granted the State a participation of \"at least 50%\" over the oil companies' extraordinary revenues.589\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 191.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 206-209.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 442-449.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 188-194 and 206-216.\n\n379.\n\nLaw 42 at the 50% rate was, however, insufficient to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs. That is why, in October 2007, Decree 662 increased the Law 42 rate from 50% to 99%.590 Shortly thereafter, in December 2007, Ecuador passed the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria* (\"LET\"), which set the tax rate on extraordinary profits at 70% and allowed for a new reference price to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.591 Ecuador reached an agreement with all major oil companies except Burlington and Perenco. Despite Ecuador's continuing efforts, Burlington simply refused to negotiate fairer terms for the PSCs.592\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 220.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 221.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 220-250.\n\n380.\n\nContrary to what Burlington alleges, Ecuador does not rely on the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine or *th\u00e9orie de l'impr\u00e9vision*.593 Rather, Ecuador alleges that the massive and unforeseen increase of oil prices altered the economic premises upon which the parties entered into the PSCs.594 Under these economic premises, which were incorporated into participation percentages in the PSCs, the price of oil was projected to be around USD 15 per barrel over the life of the contract and the contractor's IRR at 15%.595 Because subsequent events disproved these economic premises, the PSCs had to be renegotiated.596\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 4 and 104.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 195-204.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 73, 107-109.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 205-207.\n\n381.\n\nLaw 42 did not modify the PSCs. Law 42 deals solely with oil prices while the PSCs allocate oil volumes and nowhere refer to oil prices.597 Law 42 cannot modify the PSCs because it addresses an issue not covered by the PSCs. The Ecuadorian Constitutional Court (the \"Constitutional Court\"), the country's highest court, reached this conclusion.598 Because the PSCs are governed by Ecuadorian law, the Tribunal cannot disregard or overrule the Constitutional Court's decision, for this would be contrary to international law.599 In particular, the Constitutional Court held that Law 42:\n\n\"[C]reates obligations over matters that have not been the subject of contractual stipulation, that have not been agreed upon or foreseen, situations that were impossible to foresee, and had they been foreseeable, by the very nature of the contract, could not have been part of the [parties'] understanding, and therefore they did not affect or influence the consent of the parties.\"600\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 267-271.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 265-279.\n\n*Id*.\n\nExh. EL-19, p. 25 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n382.\n\nLikewise, Law 42 did not breach the renegotiation clauses in the PSCs.601 Under Ecuadorian law, Law 42 is a \"levy\" and, as such, part of the tax system referred to in the renegotiation clauses.602 Yet, Law 42 did not breach these clauses. To begin with, Law 42 did not affect the economy of the PSCs. This is because Law 42 only applied above the price assumption of USD 15 per barrel upon which the PSCs were based.603 Moreover, even if the economy had been affected, Ecuador did not breach its obligation to renegotiate the PSCs, as it was in fact always willing to negotiate with Burlington. The Parties, however, failed to reach an agreement. In light of this failure, the Tribunal has neither the jurisdiction nor the power to fill in the gap and determine what the Parties would have agreed to.604\n\nClause 11.12 of the PSC for Block 7 (Exh. C-1) and clause 11.7 of the PSC for Block 21 (Exh. C-2).\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 283-289.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 323-344.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 345-364\n\n383.\n\nMoreover, not every contract breach amounts to a treaty breach. Even if Law 42 breached the PSCs, this purported contract breach would not amount to a treaty breach. As the tribunal in *Waste Management v. Mexico* held, \"the mere nonperformance of a contractual obligation is not to be equated with a taking of property [\u2026].\"605 A contract breach amounts to expropriation only if there is \"an effective repudiation of the [contractual] right, unredressed by any remedies available to the Claimant, which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent.\"606 Burlington has not met this standard.\n\n*Waste Management II* Award, at \u00b6 174 (Exh. EL-67).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 175.\n\n384.\n\nWith respect to the expropriation claim, Burlington bears a heavy burden. The standard for expropriation is high when the challenged measure is a tax.607 A State's regulatory measure is to be presumed valid and Burlington has failed to rebut this presumption. Contrary to Burlington's arguments, Law 42 was a legitimate and *bona fide* exercise of Ecuador's regulatory power.608 The purpose of Law 42 was to \"remedy a disequilibrium caused by a massive and unforeseen increase in oil prices.\"609 As a result of the inelasticity of the PSCs, oil companies were drawing more benefits than Ecuador from this price increase.610 Law 42 was ultimately intended to ensure a \"fair allocation\" of the revenues stemming from the exploitation of Ecuador's natural resources.611\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 397-398.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 400, \u00a7 5.1.3.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 440.\n\n*Id*.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 453.\n\n385.\n\nIn particular, the tribunal in *EnCana v. Ecuador* noted that, in the context of expropriation, \"taxation is in a special category.\"612 It is only in an \"extreme case\" that a tax of general application may become expropriatory. Specifically, the *EnCana* tribunal held that a tax may be expropriatory only if it is \"extraordinary, punitive in amount or arbitrary in its incidence.\"613 A tax measure is \"extreme\" when the State acts \"with a discriminatory intention [and] with a designated purpose to confiscate the property rights of the investor.\"614 However, Burlington has failed to submit evidence that would meet this standard.615\n\nTr. 226:3-7; Exh. EL-45, \u00b6 177.\n\nExh. EL-45, \u00b6 177.\n\nTr. 232:12-15.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 391-399.\n\n386.\n\nAt any rate, Law 42 was not expropriatory, whether at the 50% or at the 99% rate. First, as shown above, Law 42 did not breach the PSCs. Therefore, Law 42 could not, by definition, expropriate Burlington's rights under the PSCs. Second, Law 42 did not constitute a *permanent* deprivation of Burlington's investment. This is because Law 42 applies if and only if the price of oil is above the reference price. Since Law 42 has been enacted, the price has not always been above the reference price, such as for instance in January and February 2009. Third, as specified below, Burlington's rights under the PSCs did not become worthless.\n\n387.\n\nLaw 42 at the 50% rate did not cause Burlington's rights to become worthless.616 The Consortium's tax returns show that its gross and after-Law 42-tax profits in 2006 and 2007 were higher than its gross and after-tax profits in 2005.617 The Fair Links experts also concluded that Burlington's operations were not \"uneconomic.\"618 In November 2006, the Consortium submitted the Oso Plan in order to make additional investments for USD 100 million.619 The purpose of the Oso Plan was to show that these additional investments were \"economically viable\" both for Ecuador and the contractor.620 Finally, ConocoPhillips' annual reports for the period 2006-2008 show no impairment of its Ecuadorian assets.621\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 480.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 481-482.\n\nFair Links ER, \u00b6 90; RCM, \u00b6 483.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 484-494.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 486.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 495-497.\n\n388.\n\nLikewise, Law 42 at the 99% rate did not render Burlington's rights worthless. Fair Links confirmed that Law 42 at 99% \"did not alter the global trend of positive cash flows.\"622 The Consortium's Oso Plan shows that the increase from 50% to 99% did not substantially alter the economic viability of the project.623 Again, ConocoPhillips' annual reports for the period 2006-2008 show no impairment of its Ecuadorian assets. There is an impairment for the year 2009, but only because the Consortium decided to suspend operations in that year.624\n\nFair Links ER, \u00b6 94.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 519-521.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 522-523.\n\n389.\n\nBurlington has centred its case around the percentages of the Law 42 tax rates, in order to convey an image that the take of the State was significant. However, what Burlington does not show is its revenues per barrel in absolute terms.625 In July 2006, when Law 42 applied for the first time at the 50% rate, Burlington was realizing USD 48.28 per barrel of oil.626 And in November 2007, when Law 42 first applied at the 99% rate, Burlington was realizing USD 31.37 per barrel of oil.627 As shown by the graph below628, these figures are significantly above the equilibrium point the parties agreed to in the PSCs, and allowed Burlington to make a reasonable profit.\n\nTr. 274:4-11.\n\nTr. 272:22-273:7.\n\nTr. 274:6-11.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 299.\n\n390.\n\nIn sum, Ecuador alleges that Law 42, be it at the rate of 50% or of 99%, did *not* expropriate Burlington's investment.\n\n3.2.3. Analysis\n---------------\n\na. Standard for expropriatory taxation\n--------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nTaxation is an essential prerogative of State sovereignty. By virtue of this sovereign prerogative, States may tax not only their own nationals but also aliens, including foreign investors, if they effectuate investments in those States.629 A tax is by definition an appropriation of assets by the State.630 It is also by definition non-compensable. In the well-known phrase of Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, taxes are \"the price we pay for civilized society.\"631 In other words, general taxation is the result of a State's permissible exercise of regulatory powers. It is not an expropriation.\n\n\"Taxation is, in a sense, a partial confiscation.\" A.R. Albrecht, *The Taxation of Aliens under International Law*, (hereinafter \"Albrecht\"), 29 THE BRITISH YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 145, (1952) at p. 173 in the original pagination (Exh. EL-124).\n\nAndrew Newcombe and Llu\u00eds Paradell, *Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment*, (hereinafter \"Newcombe & Paradell\"), Kluwer (2009), pp. 321-398, at 360.\n\nJ. Holmes, dissenting opinion in Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabaco de Filipinas v. Collector of Internal Revenue, 275 U.S. 87, at 100 (1927).\n\n392.\n\nThere are, however, limits to the State's power to tax. There are limits that arise from customary international law on taxation and limits that arise from the protections granted under international law to foreign investments, the only relevant one for present purposes being the protection against expropriation under the Treaty. In the absence of guidance in the Treaty as to the relationship between taxation and expropriation, the Tribunal will consider the limits existing under customary international law recognizing that \"[i]n interpreting a treaty, account has to be taken of any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties \u2013 a requirement which the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") has held includes relevant rules of general customary international law.\"632\n\n*Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic*, (hereinafter \" *Saluka* \"), UNCITRAL, Partial Award of 17 March 2006, \u00b6 254 (Exh. CL-100; internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n393.\n\nCustomary international law imposes two limitations on the power to tax. Taxes may not be discriminatory and they may not be confiscatory.633 Confiscatory taxation essentially \"takes too much from the taxpayer.\"634 The determination of how much is too much constitutes a fact specific inquiry.635 Among the factors to be considered one counts first and foremost the tax rate and the amount of payment required.636 If the amount required is so high that taxpayers are forced to abandon the property or sell it at a distress price, the tax is confiscatory.\n\nAlbrecht, *supra* note 629, at 169 and ss. (Exh. EL-124).\n\n*Id*., at 173.\n\nNewcombe & Paradell, *supra* note 630, at 366.\n\nAlbrecht, *supra* note 629, at 174-175 (Exh. EL-124).\n\n394.\n\nThe concept of confiscatory taxation appears to correspond to that of expropriatory taxation. The US Restatement Third of the Law of Foreign Relations provides that states are responsible for \"expropriation [...] when it subjects alien property to taxation [...] that is confiscatory [\u2026].\"637 Under the Harvard Draft Convention, the execution of tax laws is not wrongful provided that the tax \"is not an abuse of [...] powers [...] for the purpose of depriving an alien of his property.\"638 Similarly, in an article on the interface between investment protection and fiscal powers, Thomas Walde and Abba Kolo, for instance, refer to the concepts of \"confiscatory taxation\" and \"expropriatory taxation\" interchangeably.639 Consequently, the notion of confiscatory taxation under customary international law may inform the Tribunal's understanding of unlawful expropriation by way of taxes under the Treaty.\n\n*Restatement Third of the Law of Foreign Relations of the United States*, American Law Institute (1987), p. 200 in the original pagination (Exh. EL-164).\n\nLouis B. Sohn and Richard R.

These authors also refer to the concept of \"confiscatory expropriation\" to explain that investment treaties often concern themselves only with extreme fiscal measures (p. 424).\n\n395.\n\nThe most important factor to distinguish permissible from confiscatory taxation is the effect of the tax.640 The effects required for a tax to be deemed confiscatory do not appear to be different from those required to assess the existence of an indirect expropriation. In other words, confiscatory taxation constitutes an expropriation without compensation and is unlawful.641 The Parties have also attached importance to the effects of the tax. Burlington alleged that Law 42 was a measure tantamount to expropriation because it \"resulted in a substantial deprivation.\"642 Ecuador has in turn submitted that a tax measure may be tantamount to expropriation only if it causes \"the effects required for any indirect expropriation.\"643\n\nAlbrecht, *supra* note 629, at 173-175 (Exh.

RCM, \u00b6 426.\n\n396.\n\nWhen assessing the evidence of an expropriation, international tribunals have generally applied the sole effects test and focused on substantial deprivation. By way of example, one may cite *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, where the tribunal stated that \"under international law, expropriation requires a 'substantial deprivation'\"644, or *Occidental v. Ecuador*, where in relation to tax measures, the tribunal referred to the same \"criterion of 'substantial deprivation' under international law [\u2026].\"645 In *Archer Daniels v. Mexico*, the tribunal noted that \"expropriation occurs if the interference is substantial.\"646\n\n*Pope & Talbot v.

The United Mexican States*, (hereinafter \" *Archer Daniels* \"), Award of 21 November 2007, \u00b6 240.\n\n397.\n\nWhen a measure affects the environment or conditions under which the investor carries on its business, what appears to be decisive, in assessing whether there is a substantial deprivation, is the loss of the economic value or economic viability of the investment. In this sense, some tribunals have focused on the use and enjoyment of property.647 The loss of viability does not necessarily imply a loss of management or control. What matters is the capacity to earn a commercial return. After all, investors make investments to earn a return. If they lose this possibility as a result of a State measure, then they have lost the economic use of their investment.\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, (hereinafter \" *Middle East Cement\"*), Award of 12 April 2002, \u00b6107 (Exh. EL-91).; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, (hereinafter \" *Parkerings*), Award of 11 September 2007, \u00b6 437 (Exh. CL-119).\n\n398.\n\nMost tribunals apply the test of expropriation, however it is phrased, to the investment as a whole.648 Applied to the investment as a whole, the criterion of loss of the economic use or viability of the investment implies that the investment as a whole has become unviable. The measure is expropriatory, whether it affects the entire investment or only part of it, as long as the operation of the investment cannot generate a commercial return.649\n\nSee cases cited in n. 407, 408 and 409.\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. the United Mexican States*, (hereinafter \" *Metalclad* \"), Award of 30 August 2000, \u00b6\u00b6104-108 (Exh.

EL-127).\n\n399.\n\nThe inquiry under the test of loss of economic use or viability goes beyond the issue of whether the challenged measure caused a reduction or loss of profits. In *Archer Daniels*, for instance, the tribunal concluded that a \"loss of benefits or expectation [...] is not a sufficient criterion for an expropriation.\"650 In the same vein, the tribunal in *Paushok v. Mongolia* held that \"a loss of that size [around USD 1 million] for one year is not a matter leading to the destruction of an ongoing enterprise.\"651 While losses in one year may indicate that the investment has become unviable and will not return to profitability, this is not necessarily so and a finding of expropriation would need to assess the future prospects of earning a commercial return. It must be shown that the investment's continuing capacity to generate a return has been virtually extinguished.\n\n*Archer Daniels* Award, at \u00b6 251.\n\n*Sergei Paushok et al. v. the Government of Mongolia*, (hereinafter \" *Paushok* \"), UNCITRAL arbitration, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability of 28 April 2011, \u00b6 334.\n\n400.\n\nHaving circumscribed the test applicable to expropriation by way of taxation, additional questions arise in respect of the role of the State's intent, the discriminatory character of the tax and the weight of contractual stabilization clauses.\n\n401.\n\nIn addition to the impact of the tax, the State's intent is another factor that tribunals sometimes consider to draw the line between permissible and confiscatory taxation.652 Therefore, a finding that a State measure is designed to \"depriv[e]\"653 the investor of its property or to cause it to \"abandon [...] or sell it at a distress price\"654 would tend to support a finding of expropriation. However, it is clear that the intent plays a secondary role relative to the effects test. In *Tippetts*, the tribunal held that \"the intent of the government is less important than the effects of the measures [...].\"655 Thus, evidence of intent may serve to confirm the outcome of the effects test, but does not replace it.\n\n*Petrobart Ltd. v. Kyrgyzstan*, Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award of 29 March 2005, p. 55.

To reach the level of an expropriation, the discriminatory tax must still meet the test of substantial deprivation discussed above.\n\nAlbrecht, *supra* note 633, at 170-171 (Exh. EL-124).\n\n403.\n\nRelying on *Revere Copper,*657 Burlington has also argued that a tax that is contrary to a tax stabilization or similar clause amounts to expropriatory. According to Burlington, such a tax would \"make the leap from a *bona fide* government regulation to an expropriatory measure.\"658 It is unquestionable that such a tax would amount to a breach of contract. However, to determine whether it constitutes an expropriation, the question remains whether the tax causes a substantial deprivation of the investment as a whole.\n\nIn *Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. v. Overseas Private Investment Corporation*, (hereinafter \" *Revere Copper* \"), Award of 24 August 1974, the majority of the tribunal held that, although the effects of the tax \u2013 the \"Bauxite Levy\" \u2013 were \"not confiscatory\", the tax was nonetheless \"expropriatory\" because it amounted to a repudiation of the contractual commitment to tax stability that had deprived the investor of effective control over its investment. (Exh. CL-104 at pp. 45, 52-55 and 57-60).\n\nTr. 1266:10-13.\n\n404.\n\nA final comment is in place in this context in connection with the nature of the tax at issue. The Law 42 tax is a so-called windfall profits tax, *i.e.* a tax applying to oil revenues exceeding the ones prevailing at the time the PSCs were executed. By definition, such a tax would appear not to have an impact upon the investment as a whole, but only on a portion of the profits. On the assumption that its effects are in line with its name, a windfall profits tax is thus unlikely to result in the expropriation of an investment. A definitive conclusion, however, may only be reached after taking into account the specific circumstances of the case, which the Tribunal will do in the subsequent sections.\n\nb. Did Law 42 and Ecuador's failure to absorb its effects breach the tax absorption clauses in the PSCs?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe tax absorption clauses contained in the PSCs were part and parcel of the value of Burlington's investment. In order to determine the effects of Law 42, the Tribunal must first determine whether Ecuador's measures were in breach of these clauses and thus affected the value of Burlington's investment. Although this analysis involves an issue of breach of contract, it is carried out for the sole purpose of deciding whether there has been an expropriation.\n\n406.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Parties disagree on whether Ecuador relies or not on the doctrine of *rebus sic stantibus*.659 According to Burlington, Ecuador relies on this doctrine, because it refers to the requirements underlying this doctrine. This is evidenced, for instance, in the reports of Ecuador's experts, Fair Links and Juan Pablo Aguilar. Ecuador, on the other hand, expressly denies relying on the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine, retorting that Burlington has pushed the wrong \"door.\"660\n\nThe *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine has three requirements: (i) an extraordinary and unforeseeable or unforeseen event must cause an imbalance in the obligations of the parties; (ii) this imbalance must be severe enough as to render performance of the contract by one of the parties too burdensome; and (iii) the event in question should not be a consequence of the actions or omissions of the party invoking the doctrine (CPHB, \u00b6 203, citing to Aguilar Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28).\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that certain documents on record contain references to the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine. Notably, the bill that President Palacio submitted to the Ecuadorian Congress and which subsequently became Law 42 stated that the PSCs were executed \"considering the *rebus sic stantibus* clause.\"661 Further, Ecuador's legal expert Mr. Aguilar stated, in the section of his report entitled \"economic equilibrium of the contract\", that supervening events can affect this economic equilibrium; when they occur, he explains, \"[w]e are faced with the *rebus sic stantibus* principle.\"662 Finally, Fair Links devoted a section of its report to describe how substantial price changes between 2002 and 2008 affected the economy of the PSCs. These would support Burlington's contention that Ecuador relies on the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine.\n\nExh. C-174, p. 3 (Tribunal's translation).\n\nAguilar Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n408.\n\nIn its post-hearing brief, however, Ecuador expressly disclaimed reliance on the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine in this arbitration. It is true that it alleged that \"a massive and unforeseen increase in oil prices\"663 affected the economy of the PSCs. While this coincides with one of the elements of the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine, Ecuador does not argue that these events subjected it to a burdensome imbalance of obligations, but rather that they invalidated the economic premises upon which the allocation of oil production in the PSCs was based. Because these economic premises were, according to Ecuador, an integral part of the PSCs, they could be relied upon directly as a matter of contract interpretation. Therefore, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Ecuador does not invoke the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine, and that there is thus no need to examine the requirements of this doctrine.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 440.\n\n409.\n\nThe Tribunal's next task is to review whether Law 42 modified or breached the PSCs. Ecuador argues that Law 42 did neither. According to Ecuador, Law 42 did not modify the PSCs because it dealt solely with oil prices, an issue the PSCs left unaddressed. The Tribunal is of a different opinion. As was discussed in Section IV(C)(iii) above, the possibility of including a price adjustment factor similar to the one included in the Tarapoa Contract was expressly discussed and rejected at the time of the negotiation of the PSCs. The non-inclusion of such an adjustment clause in the PSCs was the product of a deliberate choice by the contracting parties. Thus, the issue *was covered* in the PSCs: the parties agreed that oil production would be allocated irrespective of oil prices.664 By introducing an oil price factor to allocate oil revenues, Law 42 modified the parties' choice to exclude such a factor.\n\nThe distinction between oil volumes and oil revenues would, from an economic point of view, be artificial. The contractor's interest is in the economic value of its share \u2013 whether in the form of oil or cash. This is apparent from the text of Article 4 of Law 1993-44, which provides that \"[t]he contractor's participation share may be received in cash, subject to prior agreement with PetroEcuador\" (Exh. C-15, p. 3 in the original pagination; Tribunal's translation).\n\n410.\n\nEcuador notes that the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court has already decided that Law 42 did not modify the PSCs, and submits that this Tribunal cannot overrule or disregard such decision.665 However, while international tribunals should certainly consider decisions rendered by national courts, they are not bound by them. The purpose of investment arbitration is neutral adjudication of a dispute by a tribunal independent from both parties. If the international tribunal adjudicating the dispute were bound by the decision of an organ that forms part of one of the parties to the dispute, this purpose would be seriously jeopardized, if not defeated.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Constitutional Court held that Law 42 \"[c]reates obligations over matters that have not been the subject of contractual stipulation, that have not been agreed upon or foreseen [\u2026] and therefore that did not affect or influence the consent of the parties [in concluding the PSCs].\" (Exh. EL-19, p. 25; RCM, \u00b6 280).\n\n411.\n\nEcuador subsequently argues that Law 42 did not breach the PSCs and the renegotiation clauses, because Law 42 did not affect the economy of the PSCs and, even if it did, the application of a correction factor was not mandatory. In Section IV(C) the Tribunal concluded, however, that the economy of the PSCs meant that the contractor was entitled to its share of oil production regardless of the price of oil and of its internal rate of return. The Tribunal considers that in allocating to the State a large part of oil revenues to which Burlington was entitled under the PSCs, Law 42 had an impact on the economy of the PSCs.\n\n412.\n\nThe impact of Law 42 on the economy of the PSCs was not in and of itself a breach of the PSCs. As Ecuador has noted, the PSCs expressly contemplated the possibility that taxes could be increased or decreased. But Law 42 did trigger the contractual mechanism applicable in the event of a modification to the tax system. As the Tribunal concluded in Section IV(C), these clauses provided for the mandatory application of a correction factor in the event of a modification of the tax system. Accordingly, Ecuador was under an obligation to apply a correction factor that would absorb the effects of Law 42, which had an impact on the economy of the contract.\n\n413.\n\nThe record shows that Burlington twice requested Ecuador to comply with this obligation: once after Law 42 at 50% was passed, and once after the rate was increased to 99%. In a letter dated 18 December 2006, Burlington first requested Ecuador to apply a correction factor absorbing the effects of Law 42 at 50%.666 After Decree 662 increased the rate to 99%, Burlington again requested Ecuador to apply a correction factor that would absorb the effects of Law 42 at 99%.667 It is undisputed that Ecuador did not respond to Burlington's requests that the effects of Law 42 be absorbed.\n\nExhs. C-11 and C-12; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 130, 317.\n\nLetter of 28 November 2007, Exh. C-43; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 130, 317.\n\n414.\n\nEcuador explains its silence by the fact that Burlington did not provide an \"economic analysis demonstrating that Law 42 had affected the economy of the Participation Contracts, nor did it put forward what the appropriate adjustment should have been to re-establish that 'economy'.\"668 The explanation is unpersuasive. No economic analysis was required to show that the economy of the PSCs was affected: Law 42 deprived Burlington of an important portion of oil revenues from its oil participation share to which it was entitled under the PSCs \u2013 oil revenues which were redirected to the State in the form of taxes. The impact of Law 42 on the economy of the PSCs was therefore evident.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 189.\n\n415.\n\nAdditionally, Ecuador's explanation that it failed to respond to the requests for adjustment because Burlington did not \"put forward what the appropriate adjustment should have been\"669 is no more persuasive. After all, the chief purpose of these letters was to request the opening of the administrative procedure for the application of a correction factor.670 The Consortium's pledge to submit \"the figures\"671 in order to calculate the correction factor \u2013 a pledge made only in the December 2006 letters and not repeated in the November 2007 letters672 \u2013 was not intended to act as a condition precedent for the opening of such procedure. Rather, those figures were supposed to be submitted *in the context* of that administrative procedure.\n\n*Id*.\n\nOn 18 December 2006, the Consortium's representative wrote to PetroEcuador to request \"the opening of the applicable administrative proceeding for the parties to analyze the economic impact on the contract of [\u2026] the aforementioned taxes and fees for which the Consortium shall present the figures\" (Exh. C-11 and C-12). On 28 November 2007, Burlington's representative \u2013 as opposed to the Consortium's representative \u2013 wrote to the Attorney General of Ecuador and to PetroEcuador to request that PetroEcuador agree \"to engage forthwith in the process of calculating and implementing a correction factor pursuant to\" the tax absorption clauses in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 (Exh. C-43).\n\nExh. C-11, p. 17.\n\nIndeed, no similar pledge was made in Burlington's letters of 28 November 2007, which make no reference to the submission of \"figures\" and solely request the immediate opening of the process to calculate and implement a correction factor. Thus, Ecuador's argument that it did not react to the requests for application of a correction factor because it was awaiting the figures cannot apply with respect to Burlington's letters of 28 November 2007 (Exh. C-43). At any rate, it is clear from both sets of letters \u2013 those of December 2006 and those of November 2007 \u2013 that the gist of the request was the opening of the process that would allow for the calculation of a correction factor.\n\n416.\n\nIn the same vein, Dr. Galo Chiriboga, who was the Chief Executive Officer of PetroEcuador at the time the Consortium sent the requests for readjustment of the oil participation shares in December 2006, further explained that Ecuador failed to respond to these requests because of their inappropriate timing, considering the forthcoming year end holidays and change of administration. In the words of Dr. Galo Chiriboga:\n\n\"We are talking about the last weeks of December; in Ecuador and, I think, in the rest of the world as well, well, these are very complicated weeks, not only because of Christmas but also because of New Year's. And also, added to that, there was a new administration that was going to take office. [...] To submit a document such as this [the requests for adjustment] to a Government that ended its administration, I think it's a very inappropriate moment to submit that kind of document, in my modest opinion.\"673\n\nTr. 782:19-783:8.\n\n417.\n\nThis explanation, however, does not appear to be any more persuasive than the previous one. Even if the timing of the request had not been appropriate, nothing prevented Ecuador from responding at a later time. Moreover, Burlington reiterated its requests for readjustment in November 2007, after Law 42 at 99% was passed, and still received no response. In sum, Ecuador's failure to respond to Burlington's requests for readjustment demonstrates its unwillingness to even entertain the possibility of applying a correction factor. It was this refusal to absorb the effects of Law 42 that ultimately breached the PSCs.\n\n418.\n\nEcuador finally argues that, even if the PSCs were breached, these breaches do not amount to a Treaty breach because they do not amount to \"an effective repudiation of the right [...] which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent.\"674 However, by enacting Law 42 and then refusing to absorb its effect pursuant to the tax absorption clauses, Ecuador has in effect nullified Burlington's right to a correction factor by preventing the exercise of this right. Moreover, this nullification was made possible through the use of Ecuador's sovereign powers. While both parties to the PSCs may invoke the tax absorption clauses, only Ecuador, as a sovereign State, may increase taxes and disregard this clause.675\n\n*Waste Management II* Award, at \u00b6 175 (Exh. EL-67).\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal observed that the tax absorption clauses may be invoked by both parties to the contract and thus work \"symmetrically\" (DJ, \u00b6\u00b6 182-183). Thus, for the sake of accuracy, it should be noted that these clauses are symmetrical only in the sense that both the State and the contractor may *invoke* their application. The State, however, is the only party to the PSC that may increase and decrease taxes and therefore trigger the application of these clauses. In this other sense, the clauses are asymmetrical.\n\n419.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Law 42 affected the economy of the PSCs and that Ecuador failed to apply a correction factor pursuant to the tax absorption clauses. Accordingly, Ecuador breached the tax absorption clauses of the PSCs. This is a relevant, although by no means decisive, consideration for purposes of the expropriation analysis, which entails a broader inquiry into the investment's overall capacity to generate commercial returns for the benefit of the investor. The Tribunal must next determine whether Law 42, first at 50% and then at 99%, amounted to an expropriation of Burlington's investment.\n\nc. The effects and purpose of Law 42 at 50%\n-------------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the effects of Law 42 at 50%. Burlington claims that Law 42 at 50% had a \"devastating\" impact on Burlington's investment; specifically, it contends that Law 42 at 50% \"had a significant negative impact on the economics of Block 7 and destroyed the economics of Block 21.\"676 Ecuador counters that Law 42 at 50% is not a measure tantamount to expropriation because (i) it did not effect a \"permanent\" deprivation of Burlington's investment, (ii) nor did it cause Burlington a near total loss of the value of its PSCs rights.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 172.\n\n421.\n\nWith respect to the first objection, Ecuador contends that there is no permanent deprivation because Law 42 only applied when the price of oil was above the reference price, which was not always the case. In January and February 2009, for instance, the price of oil was below the reference price. This suffices, according to Ecuador, to conclude that Law 42 is not expropriatory. The Tribunal is unable to follow this line of argument. Law 42 permanently applies to \"non agreed or unforeseen surpluses,\"677 that is, windfall profits as defined in the law. Just like an income tax is not temporary because it does not apply in a period in which the taxpayer has no income, the fact that there may be a period without windfall profits does not turn Law 42 into a temporary measure.\n\nExh. C-7, at Article 2.\n\n422.\n\nIn other words, while the windfall profits may not be permanent, the application of Law 42 to those profits is permanent. Whenever the price of oil was above the reference price, half of the revenues in excess of the reference price would be reallocated to the State. Ecuador's subsequent failure to absorb the effects of Law 42, in accordance with the tax absorption clauses in the PSCs, confirmed the permanent effects of this tax. Therefore, Law 42 at 50% effected a permanent deprivation.\n\n423.\n\nIn connection with Ecuador's second objection and the substantial loss of the value of Burlington's investment, Burlington's case is that Law 42 at 50% was \"devastating\" because (i) it prevented Burlington from recovering past investments, (ii) it forced it to scale back its development plans, which would adversely affect its ability to seek an extension of the PSCs, and (iii) it rendered Block 21 economically non-viable. Burlington has provided no expert evidence to buttress these allegations. Ecuador replies that Law 42 at 50% did not cause a near total loss of the value of Burlington's rights under the PSCs. It bases its reply on the Consortium's tax returns for the years 2005 to 2007, the Fair Links report, the Consortium's Oso Development plan, and ConocoPhillips' annual reports for 2006 to 2008.\n\n424.\n\nLaw 42 at the 50% rate applied between April 2006 and October 2007. From April to December 2006, Burlington made Law 42 payments in the amount of USD 15.85 million for Block 7 (42.5% of total Law 42 payments of USD 37,303 for Block 7),678 and USD 23.04 million for Block 21 (46.25% of total Law 42 payments of USD 49,814 million for Block 21).679 In the aggregate, Burlington made Law 42 payments for a total of USD 38.89 million in 2006. The real impact of Law 42 is, however, lower than what the total Law 42 payments reflect: had Law 42 payments not been made, the corresponding amounts would have become additional income for Burlington, to which the ordinary income tax and employment contributions would have applied. As the income tax (25%) and the employment contribution (15%) alone add up to about 40%680, the real impact of Law 42 is approximately 60% of the total Law 42 payments, *i.e.* about USD 23 million.681\n\nAs previously noted, Burlington's ownership interest in Block 7 is 42.5% and the total Law 42 payments are reflected in its financial statements for 2006 (Exh. C-419, p. 6).\n\nBurlington's ownership interest in Block 21 is 46.25% and the total Law 42 payments are reflected in its financial statements for 2006 (Exh. C-419, p. 9)\n\nAs explained *supra* at note 17, the combined impact of the income tax and the employment contribution is 36.5%, not 40%. However, since municipal taxes and reinvestment obligation must also be taken into account, it appears reasonable to round it up at 40% for computation purposes.\n\nThe exact figure is USD 23.33 million.\n\n425.\n\nStill in 2006, Burlington made net profits of USD 30.85 million in Block 7 (42.5% of total net profits of USD 72,579 for Block 7)682 and USD 13.33 million in Block 21 (46.25% of total net profits of USD 28,821 for Block 21).683 In the aggregate, Burlington made net profits of USD 44.18 million in 2006. However, since Law 42 only applied for three-fourths of the year, the impact of Law 42 in 2006 must be measured on three-quarters of the total profits (or 75% of USD 44.18 million), which equal USD 33.14 million. Had Law 42 not applied, Burlington's three quarter profits of USD 33.14 million would have been USD 56.14 million (USD 33.14 million + USD 23 million). Thus, Law 42 at 50% reduced Burlington's net profits by around 40% (USD 23 million out of a total of USD 56.14 million).\n\nExh. C-419, p. 6.\n\n*Id*., at 9.\n\n426.\n\nIn 2007, Law 42 at 50% applied for the ten-month period spanning from January to October 2007. As of November 2007, Burlington was subject to the higher 99% rate. The overall impact of Law 42 on Burlington's investment was greater in 2007 than in 2006. Burlington's Law 42 payments in 2007 totalled USD 87.74 million (42.5% of USD 98,128 million for Block 7 plus 46.25% of USD 99,552 million for Block 21).684 The real impact of these payments (taking into account the taxes that Burlington would have paid had it not been subject to Law 42) was of approximately USD 52.64 million. Burlington's profits, in turn, totalled USD 30.95 million (42.5% of USD 57.28 million for Block 7 plus 46.25% of USD 14.3 million for Block 21).685 Thus, Law 42 diminished Burlington's net profits by around 62.9 % in 2007 (USD 52.64 million out of USD 83.6 million).686 However, because Burlington's financial statements do not appear to distinguish between Law 42 payments at the 50% rate from those at the 99% rate, it is not possible to precisely determine the impact of Law 42 at 50% in 2007. This impact is certainly lower than 62.9%, since Law 42 applied at the 99% rate during November and December 2007. The figures for 2006 appear therefore more reliable to evaluate the impact of Law 42 at 50%.\n\nExh. C-420, pp. 6 and 9.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n427.\n\nAnother way to appreciate the effects of Law 42 on Burlington's investment is to focus on the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of a barrel of oil.687 From the proceeds of a barrel of Oriente crude oil from Block 7, the market value of which was USD 66.56 in July 2006, Burlington would have received USD 48.28 and would have made Law 42 payments at 50% for USD 18.36. The Law 42 tax would amount to 27.6% of the total value of the Oriente crude oil barrel, or slightly more than one-fourth.\n\nLaw 42 applied whether there was an actual sale or not. Hence, actual proceeds were not a prerequisite for the application of Law 42.\n\n428.\n\nThe impact would have been greater for a barrel of Napo crude from Block 21. Although the price of Napo oil from Block 21 was lower (in July 2006 it was USD 57.43 per barrel; Oil Prices tab at the end of Martinez's direct examination bundle), the Law 42 reference price was also lower (USD 15 in April 2006). Assuming that the reference price of Law 42, adjusted for inflation, had been USD 20 per barrel in Block 21, the impact of Law 42 would have been close to one-third (the Law 42 payment would have been USD 18,715 per barrel of Napo oil, or 32.6% of the value of a Napo oil barrel).\n\n429.\n\nIn relative terms, Law 42 at 50% reduced Burlington's take on the total oil revenues (after taxes and including operating costs) produced by the Blocks from 48.9% to 34.6% in Block 7 (a 29.2% reduction), and from 57.4% to 38.6% in Block 21 (a 32.8% reduction). If Burlington's operating costs are subtracted from its revenues, Law 42 at 50% reduced Burlington's take on total oil revenues from 38.3% to 24% in Block 7 (a 37.3% reduction), and from 48.6% to 29.9% (a 38.5% reduction) in Block 21.\n\n430.\n\nOn the basis of these figures, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the effects of Law 42 at 50 % do not amount to a substantial deprivation of the value of Burlington's investment. Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a disagrees with this finding for the reasons explained in the attached dissenting opinion.\n\n431.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the following facts. First, despite the enactment of Law 42 at 50%, the Consortium submitted a plan for additional investments of USD 100 million in the Oso field, which according to Burlington's own description was the \"largest field in Block 7 and the center of the Block's development plans.\"688 As Ecuador noted, in submitting the Oso plan, the Consortium implicitly conceded that Block 7 was economically viable even with Law 42 at the 50% rate. Second, Burlington's allegation that Block 21 was \"not viable\" with Law 42 at 50% is not supported by the record. As Fair Links pointed out, Burlington's financial statements for Block 21 do not show a loss but a \"positive figure.\"689 Third, Burlington acknowledged that there were bidders willing to acquire its interest in the Blocks despite the effects of Law 42 at 50%.690\n\nMem., \u00b6 174.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. M\u00e9lard de Feuardent, testifying on behalf of Fair Links, explained the following in connection with the Consortium's 2006 financial statement for Block 21: \"On these figures you will see the profit and loss account for Block 21. What do we see? Total income is 171.9 million [\u2026]. Total cost, 117.8 million, which leads you to a result before tax of [USD] 54 million and after tax of [USD] 28.8 million. That is not a taxable income loss. That is a positive figure. Costs are less than revenues\" (Tr. 1170:5-12; Exh. C-419, p. 9). A similar analysis and conclusion would result from the 2007 financial statement for Block 21 (Exh. C-420, p. 9). Law 42 at 50% was in force from April 2006 to October 2007; thus, the 2006 and 2007 financial statements cover the entire period in which the 50% tax was applicable. This evidence appears to belie Mr. Martinez's testimony to the effect that Law 42 at 50% \"effectively made Block 21 go negative in income\" (Tr. 339:6-8).\n\nBurlington's specifically alleged that when Law 42 at 99% was enacted, \"prospective purchasers\" of its Ecuadorian assets \"rescinded their offers\" (Mem., \u00b6 261; CSM, \u00b6 31.). This presupposes that these offers were valid before the Law 42 rate was increased to 99%, that is, when Law 42 at 50% was in effect.\n\n432.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the purpose of Law 42 at 50%. According to Burlington, the purpose of Law 42 at 50% was to force it to abdicate its rights under the PSCs and was thus expropriatory. Ecuador maintains that the purpose of Law 42 was to restore the economics of the PSCs, to prompt oil companies to negotiate with the State, and ultimately to strike a fair allocation of the oil revenues. The record does not support Burlington's allegation that the purpose behind Law 42 at 50% was expropriatory. The purpose seems rather to have been to replicate in the PSCs the effects that the price adjustment clause in the Tarapoa Contract would produce in a scenario of high oil prices, *i.e.* to share the windfall profits resulting from the higher prices on a 50/50 basis between the State and the oil company. As one Ecuadorian congressman observed in the context of the discussions of President Palacio's bill that would later become Law 42:\n\n\"Look, it's as if it were copied, that is the proposal that the Government is making, what is already envisaged in one contract [the Tarapoa contract], and we want that this, which is already envisaged in one contract, be incorporated in the rest of the contracts.\"691\n\nExh. C-177, at 73.\n\n433.\n\nThese facts corroborate the Tribunal's earlier conclusion that Law 42 at 50% did not substantially deprive Burlington of the value of its investment, and was therefore *not* a measure tantamount to expropriation.\n\nd. The effects and purpose of Law 42 at 99%\n-------------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nThe Parties also disagree on the effects of Law 42 at 99%. Burlington asserts that Law 42 at 99% \"destroyed\" the value of its investment. As a result of Law 42 at 99%, Burlington claims that it sustained a loss of USD 60 million in 2008, and it made no additional investments in either Block 7 or Block 21. In contrast, Ecuador essentially argues that Burlington sustained no loss in 2008 because Law 42 at 99% \"did not alter the global trend of positive cash flows\", that the Oso plan shows that Law 42 at 99% did not substantially alter the viability of Burlington's investment, and that ConocoPhillips' annual reports for 2006 to 2008 show no impairment of its Ecuadorian assets.692\n\nEcuador also argues that Law 42 at 99% was not expropriatory because it did not cause Burlington a \"permanent\" deprivation. That objection has already been disposed of in the context of Law 42 at 50% for reasons that apply with the same force here as well.\n\n435.\n\nLaw 42 at the 99% rate applied from November 2007 to around March 2009. In 2008, the only year in which Law 42 at 99% applied for the entire year, Burlington made Law 42 payments in the amount of USD 102.33 million (42.5% of total Law 42 payments of USD 240.78 million) for Block 7,693 and USD 100.76 million (46.25% of total Law 42 payments of USD 217.86 million) for Block 21.694 In combination, in 2008, Burlington made Law 42 payments for a total of USD 203.09 million. The real impact of Law 42, considering that Burlington would in any event have had to pay income tax (25%) and employment contributions (15%) over this amount, amounts to USD 121.85 million.\n\nFair Links ER, Appendix 11; CPHB, Annex 3.\n\nFair Links ER, Appendix 11.\n\n436.\n\nThe Parties specifically disagree on whether Burlington sustained losses or made profits in 2008. Their disagreement appears to stem from the different analytical tools on which they rely to value Burlington's operations. Burlington relies on its financial statements, which include amortizations for USD 106.29 million in 2008. Ecuador, by contrast, argues that financial statements and amortizations present a distorted picture of the economic reality of Burlington's operations, and that the correct analysis should focus on cash flows.\n\n437.\n\nAccording to Burlington, amortization helps to assess the impact of Law 42 at 99% on its investment. In order to properly ascertain this impact, the Consortium's past investments must be taken into account, *i.e.* amortized. Burlington maintains that Fair Links wrongly excluded from its analysis the impact of the Consortium's capital expenditures. On direct examination, Mr. Martinez explained that amortization meant that a dollar spent in a given year for capital investments did not need to be accounted for in that particular year, but could be spread out over the next three to five years depending on the type of asset and the amortization rate. Mr. Martinez testified that the financial statements properly include the amortization of past investments because:\n\n\"You have to account for your capital. You have to account for the investment that you made in order to [...] generate the income. And it's, you know. If you're going to go out and buy a car, you don't buy a car with nothing. You have to account for that price, and you have to account for that investment.\n\nThe amortization is just a countermeasure to account for that investment. If you summed up all the amortizations and you looked at the total investment, they'll sum up, so you have to account for that capital investment that you made, and accounting-wise that's how you do it.\"695\n\nTr. 346:8-20.\n\n438.\n\nUpon examination by the Tribunal, Mr. Martinez testified that Fair Links failed to account for USD 60 million worth of capital expenditures made by the Consortium:\n\n\" [T]he Fair Links Report [is] inaccurate. It doesn't have about $60 million worth of investment accounted for in that table [...]. When you look at what the full investments are, they don't account for it all. I can't tell you where they missed it, but they missed it. [...] [W]e spent quite a bit of money in Block 21 in 2006. We drilled, I believe, almost 11 wells, and that's not \u2013 it doesn't get reflected enough [in the Fair Links Report]\"696 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 540:10-541:8.\n\n439.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, the tool to evaluate Burlington's economic operations is a cash flow analysis, because it is not affected by accounting conventions, such as amortization, which \"may distort the economic understanding\" of a project.697 On direct examination, Mr. M\u00e9lard de Feuardent of Fair Links defined cash flows, annual cash flows and cumulative cash flows:\n\n\" What are cash flows ? A very simple process. This is what you take out of your pocket when you [make] an investment, what you take out of your pocket to finance the [investment's] operation, and then what you get into your pocket as revenue for operation. The sum of these three out-of-pocket issues are what constitutes the annual cash flows. [In the graphs below], the annual cash flows are represented by the gray bars. [...].\n\nAnnual cash flow will not help you to look at the overall profitability of the project [...]. The profitability of the long-term project is to be considered as the sum of the annual cash flows over the whole life of the project [...]. This sum is represented in our graph by the red line, which represent[s the] cumulative cash flow of the project starting [from] 2000 onwards\"698 (emphasis added).\n\nFair Links ER, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93; Tr. 1163:9-16.\n\nTr. 1159:10-1161:21.\n\n440.\n\nAccording to the Fair Links report,699 the annual and cumulative free cash flows for Block 7 were as follows:\n\nFair Links ER, p. 32\n\n441.\n\nWith respect to Block 21, the annual and cumulative free cash flows were the following:\n\n442.\n\nOn the basis of this cash flow analysis, Fair Links concluded that:\n\n\" Law 42 and Decree 622 did not alter the global trend of positive cash flows. In fact, for both Blocks the most significant annual cash contributions over the life of the Projects are either in 2007 (Block 21) or 2008 (Block 7), i.e. when Law 42 then Decree 622 were fully applicable\"700 (emphasis added).\n\nFair Links ER, \u00b6 94.\n\n443.\n\nEcuador additionally argues that Burlington's financial statements evince an excessive amortization rate. By 2008, the financial statements report an accumulated amortization for both Blocks of approximately 80%.701 Fair Links further observed that by 2006, only two years after Block 21 started to produce, the amortization was at 42%. Since the PSC's life did not end until 2021, this \"clearly shows that [...] there is an overburden of [] amortization.\"702 As a result, Fair Links concludes that this is \"a good illustration why financial statements such as [the Consortium's] are not the [right] approach to understand the profitability of a long-term contract.\"703\n\nTr. 441:7-442:19.\n\nTr. 1171:1-13.\n\nTr. 1171:13-16.\n\n444.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that past investments must be accounted for and that it thus appears fair to consider amortization. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the cumulative rate of amortization is considerable, reaching about 80% in Block 21 by 2008 \u2013 even though the Consortium was entitled to operate this Block until 2021. Even if the amortization rates used were required by Ecuadorian law, as Burlington has alleged704, and/or are in conformity with accounting standards, this does not mean that the Tribunal must necessarily rely on those rates to determine whether there was expropriation under the Treaty.\n\nInvestments were amortized in accordance with a distinction between pre-production and production investments. Pre-production investments were amortized on a linear basis over a five-year period. Production investments, on the other hand, were amortized on a unit-of-production basis, *i.e.* seemingly as a function of the level of production, although there is no clear indication on record of how this method is to be applied (CPHB, \u00b6179 n. 221; Exhs. C-258 and C-259; Notes 3(f) and (g); Exhs. C-260 to C-263, Notes 3(f) and (h)).\n\n445.\n\nIt appears that the loss Burlington suffered in 2008 was attributable to such high rate of amortization.705 Indeed, before amortization, the Consortium made profits of USD 62.3 million in 2008,706 paying nearly USD 10 million in income taxes for that year.707 Thus, the Tribunal considers that even if Burlington sustained an accounting loss in 2008, this is not in itself sufficient evidence that Law 42 at 99% caused a substantial deprivation of the value of its investment.708\n\nIndeed, Burlington made virtually no investments in the Blocks in 2008: it invested USD 1.39 million in Block 7 and made no investment in Block 21 (CPHB, \u00b6 50; Exhs. C-258 to C-260 and C-418 to C-419). Yet, its financial statements reflect amortizations for a total of USD 106.29 million. This does not allow to properly assess the effects of Law 42 at 99% in 2008, because of the weight of previous capital expenditures. In fact, in 2008, the Consortium's amortizations account for nearly 50% of the Consortium's total expenses \u2013 USD 106.29 million out of USD 224.66 million (Fair Links ER, Appendix 11; CPHB, Annex 2).\n\nIn 2008, the Consortium's gross profits totaled USD 180.7 million; its total costs before amortization amounted to USD 118,369. Thus, before amortization, the Consortium made profits of USD 62.3 million (Fair Links ER, Appendix 11; CPHB, Annex 2).\n\nThe Consortium paid income taxes for USD 9.78 million and employment contributions for USD 6.9 million. Fair Links ER, Appendix 11; CPHB, Annex 2.\n\nThe Tribunal finds a similar conclusion in *Paushok*, where the tribunal made the following observation: \"[A] loss of that size for one year is not a matter leading to the destruction of an ongoing enterprise [\u2026]\", *Paushok*, at \u00b6 334.\n\n446.\n\nFurthermore, the Fair Links cash flow approach, which did not disregard the Consortium's past capital expenditures but rather took them into account in the year in which they were incurred,709 leads to the conclusion that, despite Law 42 at 99%, the Consortium was still experiencing a \"global trend of positive cash flows\",710 both annual and cumulative, in each of the Blocks.711 At the hearing, Mr. M\u00e9lard de Feuardent testified, on behalf of Fair Links, that \"the cash flow was positive in 2008 [...] which mean[s] that the company was not getting money out of its pocket during operation [but] was getting money in its pocket.\"712 This evidence tends to disprove Burlington's allegation of substantial deprivation.\n\nFair Links ER, \u00b6 92.\n\nFair Links ER, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 96.\n\n*Id*.\n\nTr. 1228:22-1229:4.\n\n447.\n\nBurlington has relied on the Consortium's 2008 five-year plan as evidence of its future earning projections following the enactment of Law 42.713 The five-year plan shows that Burlington would seemingly not make new investments, that total annual oil production would decline year after year, and that as a result the production cost per barrel of oil extracted would increase.714 The five-year projection, however, does not show that the investment would lose its capacity to generate a commercial return for Burlington in the future.715\n\nExh. C-187; Tr. 547:8-548:4, where, in response to a question from the Tribunal as to earning projections, counsel for Burlington referred to the five-year plan.\n\nExh. C-187, pp. 13, 22, 27 and 34.\n\nAlex Martinez testified that, on account of the declining production and the increased production costs per barrel shown in the five-year plan, \"you get to the point where you can see where it's going to cross\", *i.e.* presumably where costs would exceed revenues (Tr. 547:22-548:4). On the basis of this document alone, however, it is not possible to reach the conclusion that production costs per oil barrel would have exceeded revenues in that five-year time frame.\n\n448.\n\nOn the other hand, the effects of Law 42 at 99% on Burlington's investment may also be evaluated by focusing on how the proceeds of a barrel of oil allocated to Burlington Oriente pursuant to the PSCs would have been distributed. For Block 7, the proceeds of a barrel of Oriente crude oil priced at USD 83.20 in November 2007, at which time the reference price adjusted for inflation was of USD 30.85,716 would have been allocated as follows: USD 31.37 per barrel to Burlington (USD 30.85 plus one percent of USD 52.35), and USD 51.83 per barrel to Ecuador.717 Hence, Law 42 at 99% deprived Burlington of 62.3% of the value of each barrel of Oriente crude oil allocated to its subsidiary under the PSCs.\n\nRPHB, p. 89; ROSS, # 118.\n\n*Id.*\n\n449.\n\nFor Block 21, the original reference price as of March 1995 was USD 15.36.718 There does not appear to be evidence on record of the statutory reference price of a barrel of Napo crude oil, adjusted for inflation, in November 2007. Assuming that the reference price was USD 19 at the time,719 the proceeds of a barrel of Napo oil priced at USD 79.09 in November 2007720 would have been apportioned as follows: USD 20.6 per barrel for Burlington (USD 20 plus one percent of USD 59.09) and USD 58.5 per barrel for Ecuador. Consequently, Law 42 at 99% deprived Burlington of approximately 73.9% of the value of each barrel of Napo crude oil allocated to its subsidiary under the PSCs.\n\nTr. 270:1-4.\n\nThe evidence shows that the reference price for Block 21 was USD 19.06 in April 2008 (COSS, Overview, ## 39-40). Thus, it may be assumed that the reference price for Block 21 would have been approximately USD 19 in November 2007.\n\nFair Links ER, Exhs. 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, also included at the end of Martinez, Oil Prices tab.\n\n450.\n\nYet another approach to ascertain the effects of Law 42 at 99%, one that Burlington has favored in presenting its case, is to consider the percentage reduction of Burlington's total oil revenues as a result of the tax. Law 42 at 99% reduced Burlington's take on the total oil revenues produced by the Blocks \u2013 after taxes but including operating costs \u2013 from 48.9% to 20.5% in Block 7721 (a 58% reduction), and from 57.4% to 17.1% in Block 21722 (a 70.2% reduction). This approach confirms that Law 42 at 99% considerably diminished Burlington's profits, but does not prove that Burlington's investment became unprofitable or worthless.\n\nCPHB, p. 180; COSS (Overview), # 36.\n\nCPHB, p. 181; COSS (Overview), # 39.\n\n451.\n\nAdditionally, Ecuador has relied on the Consortium's Oso Plan and on ConocoPhillips' annual reports to show that Law 42 at 99% was not expropriatory. However, Burlington submitted the Oso Plan when the Law 42 rate was at 50% and as such this consideration is of little assistance for the 99% tax rate inquiry. Further, the fact that ConocoPhillips' annual reports show no impairment for the 2006-2008 periods tends to suggest that the group did not consider that Law 42 at 99% had substantially deprived it of its investment in Ecuador at the time.723 On the other hand, the lack of impairment report in the annual accounts may have other explanations: the group could have considered, for instance, that it could still be compensated for the tax pursuant to the terms of the PSCs, or that it could reach a settlement with Ecuador. Thus, these considerations do not appear to be dispositive of the issue under examination.\n\nBy contrast, ConocoPhillips' annual reports for 2009, the year in which Ecuador intervened in the Blocks, do show an impairment.\n\n452.\n\nWith respect to the purpose of Law 42 at 99%, the Parties have presented diverging views. Burlington argues that the purpose of Law 42 was to force it to abdicate its rights under the PSCs. Ecuador, by contrast, contends that the purpose of Law 42 was threefold: (i) to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs; (ii) to achieve a fair allocation of the petroleum rent between the oil companies and the State; and (iii) to prompt oil companies to negotiate with the State.\n\n453.\n\nEcuador's allegation that Law 42 was intended to restore the economic equilibrium of the PSCs is unsupported by the record. As examined in Section IV(C)(iv), Ecuador did not invoke the PSCs when it sought to renegotiate terms with Burlington. Similarly, Ecuador applied the same tax rate to all PSCs, which suggest that such tax rate was not calibrated to restore the specific economic equilibrium of each PSC. Furthermore, when the Ecuadorian Congress discussed the bill that eventually became Law 42, an Ecuadorian congressman noted that the issue was whether the PSCs could be modified:\n\n\"By virtue of this Law [44] various [oil] contracts were renegotiated. One of the contracts that was renegotiated in the first place was [that of] the Tarapoa block, and that renegotiation was so well done that it included the [clause] that the [first congressman] read out, by which, when the barrel of oil exceeds USD 17, [the revenues] are shared between the State and the contractor on a 50/50 basis. Then there were other renegotiations [...], and in those renegotiations, strangely, the clause that exists in the [Tarapoa] contract was not included. Now, faced with the bill sent by the President of the Republic, we have discussed whether or not we can by law unilaterally modify oil contracts with retroactive effect. That and no other is the legal issue \"724 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. C-177, p. 103 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n454.\n\nEcuador further claims that it passed Law 42 to achieve a fair allocation of the petroleum rent. The record indeed supports the proposition that Ecuador perceived the significant increase in oil prices as having created an inequitable situation where oil companies obtained undeserved windfall profits to the detriment of the State. The Tribunal acknowledges that a fair sharing of the rent may well have been Ecuador's general and indeed legitimate goal. However, under the specific facts of this case, Ecuador had an obligation to respect the tax absorption clauses included in the PSCs.\n\n455.\n\nFinally, Ecuador argues that Law 42 was intended to prompt oil companies to negotiate with the State. While this goal may have been related to Ecuador's view that the allocation of oil revenues under the PSCs was unfair, it provides no ground to disregard Burlington's rights under the PSCs. Ecuador appears to have passed Law 42 without intending to apply the correction factor required by the tax absorption clauses of the PSCs. This course of action lends credence to Burlington's allegation that Law 42 was intended to force Burlington to abdicate its rights under the PSCs. At any rate, as the tribunal in *Tippetts* stated, \"the intent of the government is less important than the effects of the measures [...].\"725 In particular, the State's intent alone cannot make up for the lack of effects amounting to a substantial deprivation of the investment.\n\n*Tippetts*, *supra* note 655.\n\n456.\n\nHaving considered all the evidence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Law 42 at 99% substantially deprived Burlington of the value of its investment. While Law 42 at 99% diminished Burlington's profits considerably, Burlington's allegations that its investment was rendered worthless and unviable have not been substantiated. Rather, the evidence shows that, notwithstanding the enactment of Law 42 at 99%, the investment preserved its capacity to generate a commercial return. Finally, although the evidence shows that Ecuador passed Law 42 without intending to comply with the tax absorption clauses, there can be no expropriation in the absence of substantial deprivation.\n\n457.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the effects of Law 42 at 99% were not tantamount to expropriation and, accordingly, that Law 42 at 99% did not expropriate Burlington's investment. Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a disagrees with this finding for the reasons explained in the attached dissenting opinion.\n\n3.3. Did Ecuador expropriate Burlington's investment by enforcing Law 42 through the *coactiva* process, seizures and auctions?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.1. Burlington's position\n----------------------------\n\n458.\n\nBurlington argues that the *coactiva* seizures and auctions constituted a direct and complete taking because they had the effect of destroying the value of its investment.726 Specifically, Burlington alleges that (i) the *coactiva* process was in breach of the PSCs and the Tribunal's provisional measures order; (ii) the *coactiva* process was a retaliation for Burlington's refusal to abdicate its rights under the PSCs; and (iii) the *coactiva* process was an expropriatory measure.727\n\nCSM, \u00b6 88.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 87-88.\n\n459.\n\nFirst, the *coactiva* process breached the PSCs, which established that a percentage of the oil production would be allocated to Burlington. The process was also contrary to the Tribunal's provisional measures order.728 On February 14, 2009, President Correa stated at a press conference that his country would \"not pay attention to extra-regional authorities that attempt to tell us what to do or what not to do.\"729 In line with this policy, Ecuador paid no heed whatsoever to the Tribunal's order that the *coactiva* process be discontinued.730\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 88.\n\nExh. C-51, p. 2; Mem., \u00b6 237; CSM, \u00b6 37.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 97, 99.\n\n460.\n\nSecond, Burlington submits that the *coactiva* process was a retaliation for its refusal to abandon its rights under the PSCs.731 In June 2008, the Consortium began paying the Law 42 dues into a segregated account. For eight months, Ecuador voiced no objection against that practice. It did not register any complaint, place Burlington on notice of forfeiture, or make any effort to enforce Law 42.732 It was only after Burlington stood its ground during the renegotiations, which broke down in December 2008, that Ecuador initiated the *coactiva* process.733 The timing and discretionary nature of this process demonstrate that it was used as a retaliatory measure against Burlington following the breakdown of the renegotiations.734\n\nCSM, \u00b6 87.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 247.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 93.\n\n*Id*., at 90, 93.\n\n461.\n\nThird, Burlington contends that the *coactiva* process was an expropriatory measure.735 It notes that the auction process was a failure because no entity other than PetroEcuador was willing to participate in the auctions. Potential bidders were apparently dissuaded from participating because ownership over the oil cargoes was disputed.736 This allowed PetroEcuador to acquire the auctioned oil at steep discounts ranging from 33% to 50%. The failed auction process prejudiced Burlington in that it resulted in reduced offsets of the alleged Law 42 debts. PetroEcuador, by contrast, benefited from this failed process as it could acquire the oil at below-market prices, only to resell it at market prices.737\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 90-91.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 53.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 54, 74; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104; Tr. 738:10-739:2.\n\n462.\n\nThe *coactiva* process was a \"complete taking\" because it had the effect of destroying the value of Burlington's investment.738 The *coactiva* process deprived Burlington of any income.739 As a result, Burlington had to fund an investment from which it derived no revenue. Like the investors in *Benvenuti v. Congo* and *Starrett Housing v. Iran*, Burlington was deprived of the \"right to earn revenue from the receipt of its production share.\"740 Thus, the *coactiva* process was a direct taking of Burlington's tangible assets and of the economic benefits of its investment.741 In addition, as it was found in *Saipem*, the *coactiva* process also expropriated Burlington's right to have this dispute adjudicated by an ICSID tribunal, as it was in breach of the Tribunal's provisional measures order.742\n\nCSM, \u00b6 88.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 8.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 92.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 90-91.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 137.\n\n3.3.2. Ecuador's position\n-------------------------\n\n463.\n\nEcuador states that the *coactiva* process merely enforced Law 42.743 This process was the normal legal consequence of Burlington's failure to make its Law 42 payments.744 Contrary to Burlington's allegations, (i) Ecuador duly considered the Tribunal's provisional measures before commencing the *coactiva* process; (ii) the *coactiva* process was initiated in application of Ecuadorian law and not in retaliation for Burlington's decision not to sign the transitory agreements; and (iii) the *coactiva* process was not an expropriatory measure.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 531.\n\nRPHB, \u00a7 3.1.\n\n464.\n\nFirst, it is not true, as Burlington would have the Tribunal believe, that Ecuador ignored the provisional measures. At the hearing, Ministers Pastor, Palacios and Pinto testified that they had given serious consideration to the Tribunal's recommendations.745 Minister Pinto testified that Ecuador examined with great \"caution the statements made by the Tribunal.\"746 Under Ecuadorian law, public officials were under a duty to enforce Law 42, the breach of which would have resulted in civil and criminal liability. The enforcement of Law 42 was therefore not a matter of discretion under Ecuadorian law.747\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 359.\n\nTr. 728:6-8.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 361-364.\n\n465.\n\nSecond, Ecuador argues that the *coactiva* process was intended to enforce Law 42, not to retaliate against Burlington. Under Ecuadorian law, PetroEcuador was empowered to collect outstanding Law 42 payments.748 In connection with the alleged eight-month delay in initiating the *coactiva* process, Ecuador claims that it did not want to hamper the ongoing negotiations with Burlington and that Law 42 dues were calculated and liquidated annually. Thus, Ecuador had to await the end of 2008 before enforcing Law 42.749\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 531-532, 536.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 372-375.\n\n466.\n\nThird, Ecuador counters Burlington's argument that the *coactiva* process was expropriatory because PetroEcuador purchased the seized production at a \"steep discount.\"750 At the first auction, no bids were submitted; thus, a second auction round was arranged. At this second auction, PetroEcuador submitted a bid for 50% of the appraised value of the oil, as allowed under Ecuadorian law. In all subsequent auctions, PetroEcuador submitted bids at the first round for slightly more than two-thirds of the appraised value of the oil, again in conformity with Ecuadorian law.751\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 541-544.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 545-546.\n\n467.\n\nPetroEcuador submitted bids only because there were no other bidders due to the Consortium's fault. In fact, the Consortium threatened legal action against any company that would acquire the seized oil. Dissuaded by these threats, no other company submitted bids.752 This interference with the auctions harmed both the State and the Consortium, as it delayed the settlement of the outstanding Law 42 payments. Therefore, Burlington and Perenco have only themselves to blame if the auction process resulted in \"reduced offsets\" of the overdue Law 42 payments.753\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 547-549.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 550-551.\n\n468.\n\nAt any rate, Burlington has failed to show that the *coactiva* process had the effect of destroying the value of its entire investment. The *coactiva* process was economically neutral, since Burlington's Law 42 debts were extinguished as its oil was seized.754 Additionally, Burlington has wrongly argued, relying on *Saipem*, that Ecuador's decision not to comply with the Tribunal's recommendation amounted to expropriation. *Saipem's* broad interpretation of the term investment, expressly dismissed in *GEA v. Ukraine*, is inapplicable to provisional measures the goal of which is merely to prevent an aggravation of the dispute.755 In short, Burlington has not shown that the *coactiva* process was expropriatory.756\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 556; PO1, \u00b6 84.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 382-390.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 559.\n\n3.3.3. Analysis\n---------------\n\na. Standard for expropriation\n-----------------------------\n\n469.\n\nBurlington argues that the *coactiva* measures constituted a direct and complete expropriation of its investment. Relying on *LG&E v. Argentina*, Ecuador has alleged that direct expropriation is the \"forcible appropriation by the State of the tangible or intangible property of individuals by means of administrative or legislative action.\"757 Burlington has not taken issue with this definition, and rightly so.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 466; *LG&E v. Argentina*, Decision on Liability of 3 October 2006, at \u00b6 187 (Exh. EL- 140).\n\n470.\n\nIn this investment dispute, the \"property\" protected by the Treaty's expropriation clause is Burlington's entire investment in Ecuador (\"[i]nvestments shall not be expropriated [...]\"). The forcible appropriation or taking, however, only concerned the oil that was seized and not the entire investment as it was defined above. Thus, under the Treaty, there can be no direct expropriation of the investment as a result of the seizures *per se*.\n\n471.\n\nThis being so, Burlington's submission goes further in the sense that it argues that the effect of the *coactiva* measures was not only to deprive it of the oil seized and the related revenue but more generally to destroy the economic value of its investment. In the Tribunal's view, such an effect comes closer to indirect expropriation than to a direct taking. As a result, it will resort to the same test as the one applied to the alleged expropriation by way of Law 42. In fact, Ecuador has argued \u2013 and Burlington has not objected \u2013 that the following requirements needed to be met:\n\n(i) a substantial deprivation of the value of the whole investment (\"Burlington has [] failed to demonstrate how the *coactiva* procedure has the alleged effect of destroying the value of [its] entire investment\";\n\n(ii) a permanent measure (\"[a]n ephemeral taking is not expropriation\"); and\n\n(iii) a measure not justified under the police power doctrine (\"a State may justify deprivations of private property on the basis of its police powers in order to promote the general welfare and enforce its laws on its territory.\")758\n\nRCM \u00b6 556, \u00b6 662 and \u00b6 626.\n\nb. Did the *coactiva* measures enforcing Law 42 expropriate Burlington's investment?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nThe first *coactiva* seizure took place on or around 27 March 2009, when the Consortium received notice from the *coactiva* judge that an oil shipment had been seized and valued by an expert.759 On 16 July 2009, Ecuador took possession of the fields, a new measure which, although it is part of a continuous causal chain, is analytically independent from the *coactiva* measures.760 Thus, the *coactiva* measures proper, *i.e.* those *coactiva* measures not overlapping with Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks, only took place between 27 March and 15 July 2009. It is this three-and-a-half month period that the Tribunal will address here.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 45.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 65; RCM, \u00b6 578.\n\n473.\n\nPursuant to the standard set forth above, the Tribunal must ascertain whether the *coactiva* measures were a \"forcible appropriation\" that (i) substantially deprived Burlington of the value of its investment, (ii) on a permanent basis, and (iii) found no justification in the police powers doctrine.\n\n474.\n\nThe Tribunal must first ascertain whether the *coactiva* measures caused a substantial deprivation of the value of Burlington's investment. In principle, the economic impact of the *coactiva* measures should have been no greater than the economic impact of the tax they were designed to enforce, *i.e.* Law 42 at 99%. As Ecuador has submitted, the economic effect of the *coactiva* measures should be \"economically neutral\"761: for every dollar of oil seized and auctioned off, a dollar of Law 42 debt would have been extinguished. After all, in its letter of 2 July 2009, Ecuador had vouched to confine the *coactiva* measures to the \"oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt.\"762\n\nRCM, \u00b6 556.\n\nEcuador's letter to ICSID of 2 July 2009, p. 4 (Exh. C-202).\n\n475.\n\nIn reality, the *coactiva* measures did not prove to be \"economically neutral.\" They compounded the effects of the Law 42 tax at 99%. This happened because there were no bidders other than PetroEcuador during the various auction rounds held. As the sole bidder, PetroEcuador consistently made below market price bids, as is allowed under Ecuadorian law in those circumstances. The end result was that the auction proceeds from the oil seized were consistently lower than the actual market value of that oil.763 Consequently, more oil than the \"oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt\" would have to be seized and auctioned off to cancel that Law 42 debt. In short, the *coactiva* procedure as a matter of fact aggravated the economic impact of Law 42 at 99%.\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 57, 74-76; RCM, \u00b6\u00b6 543-547.\n\n476.\n\nThe Tribunal must thus ascertain whether the compounded economic effects of the *coactiva* measures, over and above the effects of Law 42 at 99%, were attributable to Ecuador. This boils down to determine whether the absence of bidders other than PetroEcuador during the multiple auction rounds was attributable to Ecuador. Burlington initially conjectured that the reason for the absence of other bidders was that \"ownership of the [oil] cargoes was in dispute and subject to the provisional measure rulings of the *Burlington* and *Perenco* tribunals.\"764 Apart from the witness statement of Alex Martinez,765 there is no evidence in support of this assertion.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 53.\n\nSecond Supplemental Witness Statement of Alex Martinez, 29 September 2010 (hereinafter Martinez Second Supp. WS), \u00b6 10.\n\n477.\n\nFor its part, Ecuador countered, with evidentiary support, that the reason why no other bidders participated in the auctions was that \"the Consortium threatened to take legal action against any company that would purchase the [seized] oil.\"766 Burlington has not denied this allegation, nor submitted evidence that would offer a different explanation for the way in which the auctions unfolded.767 Accordingly, there is no proper evidentiary basis to attribute to Ecuador the absence of bidders other than PetroEcuador during the auction rounds. For this reason, the Tribunal finds that the compounded effects of the *coactiva* measures, over and above the effects of Law 42 at 99%, are not attributable to Ecuador.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 548.\n\nBurlington did argue that \"private parties submitted higher bids than PetroEcuador\" at the last recorded auction of 16 April 2010, but these bids \"were invalidated by the *coactiva* judge\" (CSM, \u00b6 75). The Tribunal notes that this occurred only at the last auction in April 2010, that is, well beyond the March-July 2009 period under analysis herein. In addition, Burlington has not alleged that the invalidated bids were wrongly invalidated. Thus, this allegation is insufficient to demonstrate that the reason why there were no bidders other than PetroEcuador during the various auction rounds was attributable to Ecuador.\n\n478.\n\nBurlington claims that the *coactiva* measures were expropriatory insofar as they had \"the effect of destroying the value of [its] investments.\"768 These measures would have destroyed the value of Burlington's investment because they deprived it of the right to earn a revenue. The Tribunal cannot agree. Barring the issue of the absence of bidders at the auctions \u2013 which is not attributable to Ecuador \u2013, the economic effects of the *coactiva* measures were coterminous with those of Law 42 at 99%. Since Law 42 at 99% did not deprive Burlington of the right to earn a revenue from its investment, the same conclusion must hold true with respect to the *coactiva* measures. It is true that oil seizures appear to be a more intrusive form of deprivation than tax liabilities, but from an economic standpoint the impact of the *coactiva* measures is indistinguishable from that of Law 42 at 99%.769\n\nCSM, \u00b6 88.\n\nIn PO1, the Tribunal noted that Respondent's argument that the *coactiva* measures were economically neutral relative to the Law 42 tax \"misse[d] the point\" (PO1, \u00b6 84). The context in which the Tribunal made this statement bears little resemblance to the present one. The purpose of PO1 was to provisionally forestall an aggravation of the dispute on the basis of the Tribunal's *prima facie* acquaintance with the case. Because oil seizures are more intrusive than tax liabilities, they posed a greater risk of \"deteriorat[ing] the relationship\" between the Parties and thus of aggravating the dispute.\n\n479.\n\nBurlington specifically argues that it was deprived of the right to earn a revenue, like the investors in *Benvenuti v. Congo* (\" *Benvenuti* \") and in *Starrett Housing v. Iran* (\" *Starret Housing* \").770 Indeed, Ecuador's *coactiva* measures seized Burlington's entire oil participation share \u2013 and hence its entire revenues \u2013 for the period in which they were in place. But this was simply because they were enforcing the sum total of Burlington's unpaid Law 42 taxes for 2008.771 Once these overdue taxes had been collected, Burlington would have continued to receive its share of oil production \u2013 with its economic value diminished by any new Law 42 taxes. At the end of the day, the economic effect of the *coactiva* measures would have been no greater than that of the Law 42 tax itself.\n\nCSM, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\nBurlington did not pay the Law 42 tax to Ecuador, but rather placed the monies directly into a segregated account (CSM, \u00b6 33; RCM, \u00b6\u00b6 562, 590).\n\n480.\n\nIn addition, neither *Benvenuti* nor *Starret Housing* are entirely apposite to this case. While the tribunal in *Benvenuti* \"held Congo liable for confiscating the first shipment of bottled water\" produced by the joint venture between Benvenuti and Congo, it did not hold that such measure was expropriatory.772 In *Starrett Housing*, on the other hand, the tribunal held that Iran had expropriated the claimants' right to \"collect the proceeds of the [apartment] sales\",773 but only after finding that the claimants had been deprived of the \"effective use and control\"774 of its property rights in the investment \u2013 a finding this Tribunal has not made at this juncture. Despite the *coactiva*, Burlington kept effective use and control over the Blocks, the oil wells and its subsidiary. These cases are thus of limited assistance for purposes of this case.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 91; *S.A.R.L. Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Government of the People's Repulic of Congo*, Award of 8 August 1980 (Exh. CL-21). In reality, Congo did not \"confiscate[] the first shipment of bottled water\", as argued by Burlington. Rather, Siacongo, a State corporation, simply failed to pay for the 800,000 bottles delivered by Plasco, the joint venture between Benvenuti and Congo (*Id.,* at \u00b6\u00b6 2.17, 4.38-4.40). Specifically, Benvenuti complained that \"[t]he Government did not fulfil its contractual economic obligations with respect to Plasco [\u2026] [as it did not] take steps to force Siacongo, a State company, to perform its contract with Plasco\" (*Id.,* at \u00b6 4.8(3)). The issue was thus one of contract performance, not of expropriation. While there was an expropriation claim, this claim concerned Benvenuti's shares in Plasco, not a shipment of bottled water) (*Id.,* at \u00b6\u00b6 4.61-62, 4.73).\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, Iran-US CTR 122, Interlocutory Award of 19 December 1983, p. 29 (Exh. CL-20).\n\n*Id*., at p. 27.\n\n481.\n\nFurthermore, relying on *Saipem v. Bangladesh,* Burlington contends that the continuation of the *coactiva* process despite the Tribunal's provisional measures \"constituted an expropriation of Burlington's right under the PSCs to have this dispute resolved by an ICSID tribunal.\"775 While the Tribunal certainly does not condone Ecuador's failure to abide by the provisional measures, it cannot agree with Burlington's contention. Even assuming Burlington had a right to ICSID arbitration under the PSCs, *quod non*, the non-compliance with an order for provisional remedies, which only creates procedural rights during the arbitration (the situation here) cannot be assimilated to a court's decision to annul a final award (the situation in *Saipem*).776 In any event, the very fact that Burlington continues to pursue this arbitration condemns this argument.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 137.\n\n*Saipem*, Award of 30 June 2009. (Exh. CL-159).\n\n482.\n\nWith respect to the purpose of the *coactiva* measures, Burlington also argues that the timing and discretion of the *coactiva* measures show that they were in retaliation for its adopting self-protective measures and insisting on preserving its contractual rights.777 Ecuador objects that it did not wish to create a heavy-handed environment during negotiations with Burlington and that the Law 42 payments were calculated and liquidated annually, so that enforcement action could not have started in 2008.778 The Tribunal finds that both Parties' explanations are plausible and certainly not mutually exclusive. In any event, the Tribunal regards the effects of the measures, rather than their underlying motivation, as the dispositive consideration.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 90-93.\n\nRPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 365-375.\n\n483.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that the *coactiva* measures did not effect a substantial deprivation of Burlington's investment, it is unnecessary to review whether these measures were permanent or not. In point of fact, what must be permanent for purposes of expropriation is the substantial deprivation. If there is no substantial deprivation, the question of whether such deprivation is permanent becomes moot. This is why Burlington's reliance on *Tecmed v. Mexico* (\" *Tecmed* \") and *Metalclad v. Mexico* (\" *Metalclad* \") is not entirely germane to the facts of this case.\n\n484.\n\nBurlington relies on *Tecmed* and *Metalclad* to argue that ICSID tribunals \"have not countenanced a State's confiscation of the fruit that is an investor's reward for its efforts.\"779 But in *Tecmed*, the tribunal held that measures are expropriatory only if they are \"irreversible and permanent\"780 and so deprive the investor of the \"use and enjoyment\"781 of its investment *as if the right to earn revenue \"had ceased to exist.\"*782 For its part, the *Metalclad* tribunal stated that Mexico's measure \"permanently prevented\"783 the use of the investment and negated \"the possibility of any meaningful return\", as a result of which the investor had \" *completely lost its investment.* \"784 By contrast, it cannot here be affirmed that Burlington's right to earn revenue ceased to exist or that its investment was completely lost.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 446-449.\n\n*Tecnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. The United Mexican States*, Award of 29 May 2003, \u00b6 116 (Exh. CL-88).\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 115.\n\n*Id*. (emphasis added).\n\n*Metalclad*,at \u00b6 96\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 113 (emphasis added).\n\n485.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the *coactiva* measures did not substantially deprive Burlington of the value of its investment. In these circumstances, there is no need to examine whether the effects of these measures were permanent or whether they were justified under the police powers doctrine. For these reasons, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the *coactiva* measures did not constitute an expropriation of Burlington's investment. Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a disagrees with this finding for the reasons explained in the attached dissenting opinion.\n\n3.4. Did Ecuador expropriate Burlington's investment by taking possession of Blocks 7 and 21?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.4.1. Burlington's position\n----------------------------\n\n486.\n\nEcuador's physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 in July 2009 completely expropriated Burlington's investment. This was the final step in a series of expropriatory measures.785 As in *Vivendi II*, Ecuador's measures rendered the investment so unprofitable that Burlington was left with no rational choice other than to suspend operations.786 Burlington submits (i) that its decision to suspend operations in the Blocks was legally and economically justified; (ii) that Ecuador's takeover of the fields was arbitrary as there is no evidence that there was a real risk of damage to the Blocks; and (iii) that Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks constituted a complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 93.\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6 96; CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 71-73.\n\n487.\n\nFirst, Burlington argues that the suspension of operations was legally justified. It \"was a direct consequence of Ecuador's violations of its international law obligations, including the violation of this Tribunal's Provisional Measures Order.\"787 In these circumstances, Burlington could rely on the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*, \"whereby a party to a contract may suspend performance in the event that the other party is in breach [\u2026].\"788\n\nTr. 63:1-4; see also Tr. 63:5-8.\n\nTr. 64:17-20.\n\n488.\n\nBurlington may rely on this exception under both Ecuadorian and international law. Ecuador wrongly alleges that, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, this exception does not apply to administrative contracts such as the PSCs. However, \"Ecuador's own legal expert, Dr. Aguilar [...] recognizes that there is no decision or legislation in Ecuador [...] to support this.\"789 Moreover, it is clear \"from any logical analysis [that] hydrocarbons production is not a public service\"790 and there is thus no need to guarantee its continuous operation.791 Thus, Burlington argues that \"the Consortium's suspension was justified under Ecuadorian law.\"792\n\nTr. 65:2-6.\n\nTr. 1292:14-15.\n\nTr. 1292:8-18. Burlington acknowledges that hydrocarbons production may be an activity \"in the public interest as a revenue generator for the State\", but argues that it is not a public service by noting that one does not usually receive a \"monthly bill from [the] local hydrocarbons producer\" (Tr. 1292:16-18).\n\nCSM, \u00b6 78 n. 134.\n\n489.\n\nBurlington also relies on the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* as a matter of international law.793 International tribunals have held that this exception does apply \"when the continued operation of services becomes unreasonable in light of State measures.\"794 In *Azurix*, the tribunal stated that it would take this exception \"into account\" despite the respondent's allegations that it did not apply.795 In *Vivendi II*, the tribunal held that the State had undermined the investment to the point where it was \"utterly unrealistic to suggest that\" the investor \"should simply have stayed put, continuing to provide services for which it was not being paid and accepting ever increasing losses.\"796\n\nBurlington states that the legality of its decision to suspend operations cannot be negated \"as purely a question of Ecuadorian law\", for that would \"deny Burlington the autonomous protection of international law and frustrate the purpose of the Treaty\" (Tr. 64:9-14). It further maintained that it is well-established that \"international law prevails over domestic law\" (Tr. 64:4-7).\n\nTr. 65:12-14.\n\nTr. 65:14-66:12; COSS, # 61 (\"Overview and Legal Framework\").\n\nTr. 68:17-69:6; COSS, # 64 (\"Overview and Legal Framework\").\n\n490.\n\nAt any rate, the Hydrocarbons Law itself allowed the suspension of operations \"for up to 30 days without just cause\"797 and \"indefinitely for just cause\"798 before the State could consider terminating the PSCs. Here, Burlington's suspension was for \"just cause\" because \"the only reason for the suspension\"799 was Ecuador's breach of the Tribunal's order. On the other hand, Ecuador's reliance on its 2008 Constitution is selfserving and should be rejected.800 The 2008 Constitution, which declared that hydrocarbons production was a \"public service\" and hence not subject to suspension, only entered into effect *after* foreign investors brought international claims against Ecuador based on Law 42.801\n\nTr. 67:18-19.\n\nTr. 67:16-18.\n\nTr. 1289:7-9.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 119.\n\n*Id*.\n\n491.\n\nBurlington further maintains that the suspension of operations was economically justified. It was unreasonable to expect that Burlington should have continued to fund an investment from which it could no longer derive any revenue.802 As a result of the *coactiva*, the Consortium was responsible for all the costs and risks of production, but received zero revenue in return.803 At the hearing, counsel for Burlington stated that, \"despite reducing operational costs to the minimum\"804, the Consortium's \"costs still totalled some $ 15 million from the first seizure of crude until the physical takeover of the Blocks.\"805 In these circumstances, Burlington had no rational choice other than to suspend operations in the Blocks.806\n\nCSM, \u00b6 89.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 10.\n\nTr. 59:19-20.\n\nTr. 59:20-22.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 10.\n\n492.\n\nSecond, Burlington submits that Ecuador's physical takeover of the fields was arbitrary as there was no real risk of damage to the Blocks.807 Ecuador's evidence only shows a theoretical risk of damage following a shut-in. However, there is also a theoretical risk of damage when the wells are in operation. Specifically, the RPS report draws no meaningful conclusion on the likelihood that such theoretical risks would actually materialize.808 The report is, moreover, based on incomplete information,809 and its conclusions regarding the risks of damage to the Blocks following suspension are unsubstantiated.810\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 107.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 28.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28.\n\n493.\n\nThe Consortium planned to suspend operations using a well-developed protocol to minimize the risk of harm. This protocol was based on the Consortium's historical experience of suspending well operation for routine reasons.811 Isolation tools would have prevented cross-flow, and there were no concerns of solids migrating into the reservoir or of water incompatibility.812 As Mr. Martinez declared, \"it was in the best interest of the Consortium to ensure that suspension was conducted in a proper way.\"813 Thus, the theoretical risks of damage mentioned in the RPS report did not apply to Blocks 7 and 21.814\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 108-109.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 112-114.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 108; Martinez Second Supp. WS, \u00b6 16.\n\nCPHB, at \u00b6 112.\n\n494.\n\nThe following facts belie Ecuador's alleged fears of economic and environmental damage: (i) six months prior to the scheduled suspension, Ecuador itself asked Burlington and Ecuador to suspend operations in response to OPEC restrictions; (ii) recent field suspensions due to power failures showed no negative effects on either production or the environment; and (iii) the day of the suspension Ecuador's Minister left the country to attend celebrations in Bolivia.815 In reality, Ecuador has raised concerns about the risks of suspension for the first time in this arbitration only to justify its takeover and final expropriation of Blocks 7 and 21.816\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 11.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 118.\n\n495.\n\nThird and last, Burlington argues that Ecuador's physical takeover of the Blocks was a complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment. This was the final step in Ecuador's series of unlawful expropriatory measures817 and the inevitable consequence of Burlington's refusal to abdicate its rights under the PSCs.818 It culminated Ecuador's campaign to force Burlington to migrate to a legal regime that was more beneficial to the State in times of high oil prices. As a result of this measure, Ecuador is in possession of Burlington's entire investment.819 Thus, although no formal decree of expropriation was issued, the takeover was a complete and direct expropriation of Burlington's investment.820\n\nCSM, \u00b6 93.\n\nCPHB, \u00b6 120.\n\nCSM, \u00b6 81.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 93.\n\n3.4.2. Ecuador's position\n-------------------------\n\n496.\n\nEcuador alleges that its intervention in the Blocks was not expropriatory.821 On the contrary, Burlington's illegal decision to suspend operations was a \"cynical gamble\" designed to force Ecuador to intervene and thus create the appearance of direct expropriation.822 Specifically, Ecuador submits (i) that Burlington's threatened suspension of operations in the Blocks was illegal823 and not economically justified;824 (ii) that Burlington's decision threatened significant economic loss to Ecuador and other serious harm to the Blocks;825 and (iii) that the intervention was not expropriatory but was a temporary measure adopted in response to Burlington's unlawful conduct \u2013 as such, it was necessary, appropriate and proportionate under the circumstances.826\n\nRCM, \u00a7 7.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 565, 620.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 596-602.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 589-595.\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6 560.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 561.\n\n497.\n\nFirst, Ecuador submits that Burlington's decision to suspend operations in the Blocks was in breach of Ecuadorian law and the PSCs.827 Under Ecuadorian law, the suspension of operations was contrary to the Constitution and to the Hydrocarbons Law.828 Under the PSCs, Burlington committed to comply with Ecuadorian laws and regulations; further, the PSC for Block 7 specifically provided that the contractor had to continuously \"perform operations in the Contract Area.\"829 In accordance with Ecuadorian administrative law, Burlington was bound to perform its obligations despite any alleged breach on the part of Ecuador.830\n\n*Id.,* at 560; RPHB, \u00b6 425.\n\nRCM, at \u00b6\u00b6 597-600.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 601-602.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 604-605.\n\n498.\n\nBurlington had no legal justification to suspend operations in the Blocks.831 Whether as a matter of Ecuadorian or international law, it may not rely on the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*. As a matter of Ecuadorian law, Burlington cannot rely on this exception because this exception does not apply to administrative contracts such as the PSCs and because Ecuador did not breach the PSCs.832 As a matter of international law, the cases upon which Burlington relies are distinguishable from this case. Unlike Burlington, the investors in *Azurix* and *Vivendi II* sought to terminate their contract with the State and did not suspend operations because they were a party to a public service contract.833\n\nRPHB, \u00b6 408.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 415-420.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 422-424.\n\n499.\n\nIn addition, Burlington did not have \"just cause\" to suspend operations within the meaning of the Hydrocarbons Law. Ecuador's non-compliance with the Tribunal's recommendations could not constitute \"just cause\" for suspension. In fact, \"the recommendations were 'recommendations', *i.e.* not legally binding on Ecuador.\"834 At the hearing, Ministers Palacios, Pastor and Pinto all testified that, in Ecuador's understanding, the Tribunal's provisional measures were recommendations and therefore non-binding. In the *caducidad* decrees, Minister Pastor specifically dismissed the Consortium's argument that there was \"just cause\" for suspension under the Hydrocarbons Law.835\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 409-410 (internal parentheses omitted).\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 411-412; Witness Statement of Wilson Pastor Morris of 17 January 2011, Annex 4 (p. 20) and Annex 5 (p. 20).\n\n500.\n\nNor was Burlington's decision to unilaterally suspend operations economically justified. The *coactiva* did not leave Burlington with the \"crippling prospect of continuing to operate the Blocks for the exclusive benefit of Ecuador.\"836 On the contrary, as confirmed by Fair Links, Burlington had the financial wherewithal to continue operating the Blocks. The Consortium placed USD 327.4 million into a segregated account after it illegally stopped making Law 42 payments in June 2008. Those funds could have been used to keep the Blocks in operation.837 And as Burlington itself conceded, only minimum investment was necessary to keep operating the Blocks after Law 42 was passed.838\n\nRCM, at \u00b6 589.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 590-592; Tr. 461:17-466:12.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 593-595.\n\n501.\n\nSecond, Burlington's decision to suspend operations in the Blocks threatened significant economic loss to Ecuador and other serious and permanent harm to the Blocks. As explained by RPS, Burlington's decision to shut down the oil wells created four types of risk: risk of economic loss to Ecuador, and risk of reservoir, mechanical and environmental damage.839 As RPS observed, the shut-in of oil production would have caused economic loss to Ecuador \"as a result of the deferment of production and the associated revenue.\"840 The extent of this loss would be a function of the length of the shut-in and of the production rate of the wells that are shut in.841\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 613, 618-619.\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6 144 (4th bullet point).\n\n*Id*.; RCM, \u00b6 618.\n\n502.\n\nThe shut-in also threatened to cause serious and permanent reservoir, mechanical and environmental damage to Blocks 7 and 21.842 Reservoir damage is the deterioration of flow capacity and/or the physical loss of oil reserves. This risk was significant in Blocks 7 and 21, as most of their reservoirs are water driven.843 Mechanical damage is corrosion to the production stream of the wells, such as the wellbore tubular and pumps.844 RPS concluded that there is \"little doubt\"845 that this damage will occur to the wells in Blocks 7 and 21. Finally, environmental damage can be caused by leaks and spills related to the shut-in.846\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6\u00b6 610-613.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 614-615.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 616.\n\n*Id*.; RPS ER, \u00b6 55.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 617; RPS ER, \u00b6 56.\n\n503.\n\nThird, Ecuador submits that its intervention was not expropriatory but was rather a temporary measure adopted in response to Burlington's unlawful conduct \u2013 as such, it was necessary, appropriate and proportionate under the circumstances.847 In *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, the tribunal held that \"a deprivation can be justified if it [...] [is] aimed at the maintenance of public order.\"848 The *Saluka* tribunal determined that the context of the impugned measure was \"critical\"849 to determine its validity. As the State's measure in *Saluka*, Ecuador's intervention was permissible regulatory action because it enforced Ecuadorian law.850\n\nRCM, \u00b6 624.\n\n*Saluka*, at \u00b6 254 (Exh. CL-100.); RCM, \u00b6 628.\n\n*Saluka*, at \u00b6 264 (Exh. CL-100.); RCM, \u00b6 628\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6\u00b6 632-661.\n\n504.\n\nThe intervention in the Blocks merely enforced Ecuadorian law in light of Burlington's \"manifestly illegal\" decision.851 In similar circumstances, the tribunal in *Payne v. Iran* recognized that a State's decision to take control of a company could be justified on the ground that the claimant had \"abandoned or [\u2026] ceased\"852 its activities. Additionally, Ecuador's measure was necessary to avoid significant economic loss and the risk of permanent damage to the Blocks. It was also appropriate because Ecuador entered the Blocks without using force. It was equally proportionate as the means employed were suited to the ends of protecting the Blocks.853\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6 633.\n\n*Thomas Earl Payne v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran*, Iran-U.S. Cl. Tribunal, Award of 28 June 1988, \u00b6 21 (Exh. EL-153); RCM, \u00b6 645.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 647-661.\n\n505.\n\nLikewise, Ecuador's intervention did not expropriate Burlington's investment because it was intended to be temporary.854 In *Motorola v. Iran*, the tribunal held that if a State measure is temporary and necessary on account of claimant's actions or omissions, it cannot constitute expropriation.855 As in *Motorola*, Ecuador's intervention would have ceased once the Consortium resumed operations.856 The goal of this measure was not to permanently transfer the investor's property to the State. Accordingly, Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks cannot constitute expropriation.857\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6 624.\n\n*Motorola Inc. v. Iran National Airlines Corporation and The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran*, Iran-U.S. Cl. Tribunal, Award of 28 June 1988, at \u00b6 59 (Exh. EL-154); RCM, \u00b6 645.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 663-666.\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6 662.\n\n3.4.3. Analysis\n---------------\n\na. Standard for expropriation\n-----------------------------\n\n506.\n\nBurlington argues that the takeover of the Blocks constituted a direct expropriation of its investment. Ecuador does not object to reviewing the takeover under the standard applicable to direct expropriation and the Tribunal agrees. Accordingly, a State measure constitutes expropriation under the Treaty if (i) the measure deprives the investor of his investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) the deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine. The Tribunal will examine these elements in reverse order.\n\nb. Did Ecuador's taking of possession of Blocks 7 and 21 expropriate Burlington's investment?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, Ecuador entered and took possession of Blocks 7 and 21 after Burlington had announced, three days earlier, that operations in the Blocks would be suspended. The Tribunal must determine whether Ecuador's taking of possession of Blocks 7 and 21 constituted an expropriation of Burlington's investment. To that end, the Tribunal will first review whether Ecuador's measure was justified under the police powers doctrine. This review raises two sub-issues, namely, (i) the conditions under which Ecuador could intervene in Blocks 7 and 21 as a result of the Consortium's decision to suspend operations in Blocks 7 and 21, and (ii) the nature of the risks that the Consortium's decision to suspend operations posed to Ecuador and to the Blocks. Thereafter, the Tribunal will address (iii) the effects of Ecuador's measure on Burlington.\n\n(i) *The conditions under which Ecuador could intervene in Blocks 7 and 21*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Ecuador's submission that, as held in *Saluka*, the context of a State measure is \"critical\"858 to determine the nature of the resulting deprivation. In this case, the context of Ecuador's intervention revolves around the legality of Burlington's decision to suspend operations. According to Burlington, the decision to suspend operations was legally justified under Ecuadorian and international law; according to Ecuador, the decision was in breach of Ecuadorian law, international law and the PSCs.\n\n*Saluka*, at \u00b6 264. (\"[I]nternational tribunals must consider the circumstances in which the question [of whether there is expropriation] arises. The context within which an impugned measure is adopted and applied is critical to the determination of its validity.\") (Exh. CL-100).\n\n509.\n\nEcuadorian law governed the PSCs, which regulated in detail the rights and obligations of Ecuador and of Burlington's subsidiary, Burlington Oriente. The Tribunal therefore considers that Ecuadorian law should at least initially govern the question of whether the suspension was legal. In keeping with this opinion, both Parties have expressly relied on Ecuadorian law to argue for or against the legality of Burlington's suspension of operations.\n\n510.\n\nIt is true that Burlington has *also* relied on the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* under international law. In the words of counsel for Burlington, this exception means that \"a party to a contract may suspend performance in the event that the other party is in breach [\u2026].\"859 However, when that contract is, as the PSCs are here, specifically governed by the law of the host State, the issue of whether a party is in breach and, consequently, whether the other party may suspend performance, are to be answered initially by reference to that law.\n\nTr. 64:17-20.\n\n511.\n\nUnder Ecuadorian law, the most relevant provision on the issue of suspension of operations is Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law (\"Article 74\"). This provision spells out the circumstances under which the Ministry of Non-Renewable Resources (formerly the Ministry of Energy and Mines) may terminate a hydrocarbons contract by way of a *caducidad* declaration. As counsel for Ecuador explained at the hearing, \" *[c]aducidad* is such an important element in the participation contracts in Ecuador that the [contracting] [p]arties expressly incorporated Article 74 [...] into the [PSCs]. It wasn't enough to say [that] the Hydrocarbons Law applies to the [c]ontract.\"860 Although *caducidad* and the taking of possession are two different measures \u2013 one *de facto*, one *de jure* \u2013, the conditions under which *caducidad* may be declared are also relevant to examine whether Ecuador was entitled to intervene in the Blocks by reason of an unlawful suspension.\n\nTr. 303:15-20.\n\n512.\n\nIn its relevant part, Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides the following:\n\n\"Article 74. The Ministry of [Non-Renewable Natural Resources] may declare the *caducidad* of contracts provided that the contractor:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n4. Suspends exploitation operations for more than thirty days without just cause, previously determined by the Ministry to be so, except for force majeure or act of God, which shall be notified to PETROECUADOR within a ten-day period [\u2026]\"861 (emphasis added).\n\nExh. EL-92, p. 25 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n513.\n\nEcuador argues that the Consortium was under a legal and contractual duty to continuously operate the Blocks. The Tribunal is not convinced that this was the case. Under the plain terms of Article 74, the Ministry may not terminate a PSC if there is no suspension \"for more than thirty days\", regardless of whether there is \"just cause\" for the suspension or not. Nor may the Ministry terminate a PSC if the suspension is longer than thirty days but there is \"just cause.\" In brief, the Hydrocarbons Law authorizes contractors to suspend operations without incurring the risk of *caducidad* for up to 30 days, regardless of \"just cause\", and for more than 30 days with \"just cause.\"\n\n514.\n\nThe 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution does not lead to a different conclusion. It prohibits the \"suspension of [...] hydrocarbons production\"862*qua* public service, but it also provides that \"the law shall establish the limits\"863 to ensure the operation of these services. In the case of hydrocarbons production, these limits are those set in Article 74. Ecuador has not alleged that the 2008 Constitution somehow amended the scope of the pre-existing Article 74.\n\nExh. P-12 (exhibit submitted by PetroEcuador when it was still part of this case), Art. 326, para. 15.\n\n*Id*.\n\n515.\n\nAccording to Article 74, Ecuador has the power to declare the *caducidad* of a PSC by reason of the suspension of operations, and hence eventually to intervene in the face of a an unlawful suspension, if the suspension of operations lasts for more than 30 days.864 This condition is not met here.\n\nThis is an essential but not a sufficient condition for a *caducidad* declaration. In addition to a more than 30-day suspension, the contractor must have no \"just cause\" for suspension. Hence, the contractor can suspend operations for more 30 days without being subject to *caducidad* on condition that it has \"just cause\" to do so.\n\n516.\n\nEcuador took possession of the Blocks on 16 July 2009, the very day on which suspension was scheduled to begin: \"on 16 July 2009 \u2013 2 hours after the scheduled suspension [...] government officials entered the Blocks and took the necessary measures [...] to guarantee the continuance of operations [\u2026].\"865 By Ecuador's own admission, the Blocks were still operating at that moment: \"Blocks 7 and 21 were [] still operating at 2 pm, on 16 July 2009.\"866 Ecuador submits that the suspension did not go into effect at the scheduled time because the Consortium's employees ignored the instructions to suspend operations.867 Whatever the exact cause, the fact remains that the operations were not suspended before Ecuador took possession of the Blocks. The Consortium merely \"threatened suspension\",868 as Ecuador conceded in its submissions. This is manifestly insufficient to justify *caducidad* and intervention under the terms of Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 578.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 577.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 560, 564, 566, 567, 569, 572, 575, 576, 589, 607 and 617.\n\n517.\n\nMoreover, even if the suspension of operations had occurred and lasted more than 30 days,869 the Tribunal would have concluded that the Consortium had \"just cause\". This follows from a review of the events preceding the suspension: Ecuador enacted the Law 42 tax, failed to absorb its effects as it should have done pursuant to its commitments under the PSCs, and eventually collected the tax by way of seizures and auctions. Hence, even if the suspension had lasted more than 30 days, Ecuador would not have been entitled to intervene in the Blocks.\n\nAt the time the Consortium took the decision to suspend operations, it was unclear how long the suspension would last. The evidence suggests, however, that the Consortium was prepared to suspend operations for a period longer than 30 days (Tr. 519:7-22).\n\n518.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that the conditions for an intervention under Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law were not fulfilled, the Tribunal can dispense with analyzing whether Burlington could also rely on the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* under Ecuadorian or international law. Nor is it necessary to establish whether Burlington's decision to suspend was economically justified for purposes of this analysis.\n\n(ii) *Risks resulting from the suspension of operations*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nThe Tribunal must now examine the nature of the risks that Burlington's *decision* to suspend operations posed to Ecuador and to the Blocks. Ecuador claims that it intervened in the Blocks in order to avoid incurring significant economic losses and serious and permanent *dam* age to the Blocks. Burlington, on the other hand, submits that Ecuador's allegations are not properly substantiated and that the theoretical risks of damage identified in the RPS report did not apply to Blocks 7 and 21. The Tribunal is not persuaded that the suspension posed such a significant risk of damage as to justify Ecuador's immediate intervention.\n\n520.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that (i) RPS did not conclude that there was a significant risk of damage, but rather a \"potentially\" significant risk of damage; (ii) RPS's conclusions are admittedly based on incomplete information; (iii) the evidence suggests that the risks of reservoir and mechanical damage required an extended suspension, such that an immediate intervention in the Blocks would not have been warranted; (iv) the evidence does not show that there was a significant risk of environmental damage; and (v) the evidence does not suggest that the risk of economic loss was such as to justify the intervention. These considerations are expanded upon below.\n\n521.\n\nFirst, RPS did not conclude that the Consortium's suspension would have caused significant risk of damage, but rather \"potentially\" significant risk of damage. In its conclusions, RPS stated that shutting in producing wells caused a \"potentially significant\"870 risk of reservoir and well damage. Furthermore, at the hearing, Mr. Gene Wiggins, testifying on behalf of RPS, emphasized the potential nature of the risk:\n\n\" **[Mr Yanos]:** Now, you sum up all your thinking on the issue of the significance of these risks [of suspension] in the last bullet [of the RPS Report], and your conclusion, as I understand it, is that each of the four categories of risks that we went through in the previous bullets [...] add up to a significant risk, is that correct ?\n\n**[Mr Wiggins]:** Potentially a significant risk, yes.\n\n**[Mr Yanos]:** Potentially, right\"871 (emphasis added).\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6 144 (5th bullet point).\n\nTr. 1111:18-1112:4.\n\n522.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal notes that the RPS report is based on incomplete information. Specifically, it contains the following caveat with respect to the risk of reduced oil recovery owing to the encroachment from aquifer water: \"Further study beyond the scope of this report is necessary to quantify the damage that will occur as a result of this phenomenon [...].\"872 Similar caveats are included in connection with other risks of reservoir, mechanical and environmental damage.873 On cross-examination, Mr. Wiggins acknowledged that the word \"potentially\" was used because, in order to reach a more conclusive opinion, he would have to \"look at the complete dataset and develop a more comprehensive understanding about what's going on.\"874\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6 43.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 46, 48, 50, 52, 53, 55 and 65.\n\nTr. 1112:7-9.\n\n523.\n\nSimilarly, there was some uncertainty about the reliability of the tests employed for the report. Ecuador submitted evidence of a trend showing a lower oil production rate in the Mono fields 1, 4 and 11 following a community strike between 27 October and 12 November 2006.875 The Tribunal notes that the descending trend in Mono field 1 appears to be the continuation of a trend that predated the shut-in; in Mono 4, the production rate dropped to approximately 2004-2005 levels; and in Mono 11, the production rate actually increased immediately after the shut-in, before plummeting shortly thereafter to approximately 2003 production levels.876 Referring to this evidence, Mr. Wiggins stated on direct examination that:\n\n\" [I]nherent inaccuracies [] may exist in the data set that we deal with.\n\nWe do not have flow gauges on the wells measuring production. The way the process works is [...] operators conduct intermittent tests; and, then on the basis of those tests, production is allocated to a well for a given month. So, it's--there can be some error that comes about by virtue of the tests, how they were performed, whether they were performed properly, whether they were representative\"877 (emphasis added).\n\nTr. 1086:5-8.\n\nG. Wiggins Direct Testimony Binder, Documents 26-28.\n\nTr. 1088:3-14.\n\n524.\n\nThird, the evidence suggests that the risks of reservoir and mechanical damage would not have materialized before an extended suspension, so that an immediate intervention in the Blocks would not have been warranted. With respect to the risk of reservoir damage due to aquifer water encroachment, the RPS report refers to a study which states that this type of damage may occur after \"a *prolonged* production shutdown\"878 (emphasis added). This bolsters Mr. Martinez's testimony to the effect that the risk of aquifer water encroachment \"takes a very long time\"879 to come to pass. The RPS report appears to echo this when it concludes that the extent of this damage will \"depend on the duration of the shut-in period.\"880 Likewise, in relation to another risk of reservoir damage, another study quoted by RPS notes that \"scale commonly forms after long periods of well shut-in [\u2026].\"881\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6 40.\n\nTr. 517:15-16.\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6 43.\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6 52; Tr. 1065:3-6.\n\n525.\n\nRPS's evidence props up a similar conclusion with respect to the risk of mechanical damage. On direct examination, Mr. Wiggins explained that he was familiar with oil fields which were shut-in and experienced corrosion \"after a period of years\".882 He concluded that if, after a shut-in, the oil well equipment is \"left down-hole for *an extended period of time*, there are just very much limits to what [one] can do from a corrosion inhibition standpoint\"883 (emphasis added). Thus, the evidence does not support the proposition that the suspension of operations would have caused an immediate risk of reservoir and mechanical damage.\n\nTr. 1058:20-1059:3.\n\nTr. 1080:9-12.\n\n526.\n\nFourth, the evidence does not suggest that there was a significant risk of environmental damage. As stated in the RPS report and readily admitted by Mr. Wiggins on crossexamination, two factors create a risk of environmental damage: naturally flowing wells and lack of supervision that could cause leaks or spills.884 However, at the time of the scheduled suspension, only 2 of the 88 active wells in Blocks 7 and 21 were naturally flowing wells. In addition, the evidence shows that the Consortium was to keep personnel on the ground throughout the suspension.885 The Tribunal is thus unconvinced that the suspension would have created a significant risk of environmental damage.\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 66, 144 (12th bullet point); Tr. 1110:12-22.\n\nTr. 1111:5-10; Exhs. C-200 and C-213.\n\n527.\n\nFinally, Ecuador also relies on a risk of economic loss.886 It is true that a suspension of operations will generally produce a loss of revenues. Yet, there is no evidence of its magnitude nor of the period during which it would have accrued. Moreover, at the beginning of its direct examination, RPS qualified its conclusion that economic loss will \"invariably result\"887 from a suspension of operations by noting that this conclusion \"assumed a fairly constant oil price.\"888 This clarification was an implicit acceptance of Mr. Martinez's testimony to the effect that the economic consequences of a shut-in depend \"on the economics of the future price of crude.\"889 In conclusion, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this risk was significant enough to justify the takeover.\n\nRPS ER, \u00b6 144 (4th bullet point).\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 144 (last bullet point).\n\nTr. 1050:6-11.\n\nTr. 396:21-397:18.\n\n528.\n\nTherefore, the evidence does not persuasively establish that the suspension of operations would have created a significant risk of damage. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Ecuador's immediate intervention in the Blocks may not be justified on the ground that it was necessary to prevent serious and permanent damage to the Blocks.\n\n529.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal deems that Ecuador's entry and taking of possession of the Blocks was not justified under the police powers doctrine because (i) At the time of the taking of possession of the Blocks, Burlington's decision to suspend operations was legally justified as a matter of Ecuadorian law and (ii) the evidence does not show that Ecuador's immediate intervention in the Blocks was necessary to prevent serious and significant damage to the Blocks. The next question is to gauge the effects of Ecuador's occupation of the Blocks on Burlington.\n\n(iii) *The effects of Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nAs a purely factual matter, Ecuador's entry into and occupation of Blocks 7 and 21 dispossessed Burlington of the oil fields. Such dispossession deprived Burlington not only of its oil production share \u2013 and thus of its revenues \u2013 but also of the means of production that made those revenues possible. In a nutshell, the occupation of the Blocks deprived Burlington of all the tangible property embodying its investment in Ecuador. While Burlington still had its subsidiary's rights in the PSCs as well as the subsidiary's shares, these rights and shares had no value without possession of the oil fields and access to the oil.\n\n531.\n\nTherefore, once Ecuador entered the oil fields, Burlington could no longer be deemed to exercise \"effective use and control\" over its investment. Ecuador argues that the takeover was not expropriatory because it was intended to be a temporary measure which would have ceased once the Consortium accepted to resume operations. The Consortium, however, was under no obligation to resume operations. On the contrary, as previously concluded, Burlington \u2013 and hence the Consortium \u2013 was entitled to suspend operations for 30 days without cause and had \"just cause\" to suspend operations for more than 30 days.\n\n532.\n\nIt is nevertheless true that Ecuador's occupation of the Blocks was not a permanent measure from the outset. Indeed, in the weeks following the occupation of the Blocks, Ecuador continued to communicate with the Consortium with a view to handing back possession of the Blocks on condition that the Consortium were to resume operations. At that time, there still appeared to be \u2013 in the words of the tribunal in *Sedco v. Iran* \u2013 a \"reasonable prospect\" that the investor could \"return [to] control\"890 its investment. As long as there was such prospect, Ecuador's occupation could not be deemed to be a permanent measure.\n\n*Sedco, Inc. v. national Iranian Oil Company and the Islamic Republic of Iran*, Interlocutory Award of 28 October 1985, p. 23 (Exh. CL-160).\n\n533.\n\nOn 19 August 2009, little over a month after Ecuador's occupation of the Blocks, the Minister of Mines and Oil, Germ\u00e1nico Pinto, sent a letter to the Consortium urging it to resume operations \"within a maximum period of ten (10) days.\"891 However, this demand was inconsistent with Burlington's right to suspend operations with \"just cause\" on account of Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs and of provisional measures order. As Ecuador had by that time neither cured those breaches nor expressed an intent to do so, Burlington still had \"just cause\" to suspend operations. In other words, the *status quo* at the time of this demand was no different from that which had given rise to Burlington's right to suspend operations with \"just cause\" to begin with. Therefore, Burlington had no obligation to accept Ecuador's demand.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Mines and Oil of 19 August 2009, p.2 (Exh. C-223; Tribunal's translation.)\n\n534.\n\nOn 28 August 2009, the Consortium answered that it \"would be prepared to resume\"892 operations provided that Ecuador came \"into full compliance\"893 with its legal and contractual obligations. There is no evidence that Ecuador responded to this letter or further communicated with the Consortium in relation to the possible resumption of operations. Thus, Minister Pinto's letter of 19 August 2009, with its 10-day time limit, is the last evidence on record showing that Ecuador still entertained the possibility that the Consortium could regain possession of the Blocks.\n\nLetter from the Consortium of 28 August 2009, p.2 (Exh. C-224).\n\n*Id*.\n\n535.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal deems that, by the end of the 10-day period mentioned in Minister Pinto's letter of 19 August 2009, the possibility that the Consortium could resume operations, and hence that Burlington could regain control of the Blocks, had vanished altogether. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks became a permanent measure on 30 August 2009. As of this date, Ecuador deprived Burlington of the effective use and control of Blocks 7 and 21 on a permanent basis, and thus expropriated its investment.\n\n536.\n\nEcuador argues that the takeover of the Blocks did not affect the rights of Burlington's subsidiary under the PSCs. Even though these contract rights were still nominally in force after the takeover \u2013 as *caducidad* would not be declared until almost a year later, in July 2010 \u2013, they were bereft of any real value from the moment Burlington permanently lost effective use and control of its investment. The termination of the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 through the *caducidad* process in July 2010 merely formalized an already prevailing state of affairs, but is otherwise irrelevant for purposes of the expropriation analysis. As a result, the Tribunal will dispense with reviewing the specific submissions and arguments made in relation to *caducidad.*\n\n537.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Ecuador's physical occupation of Blocks 7 and 21 expropriated Burlington's investment as of 30 August 2009. This being so, the next question that arises is whether this expropriation was unlawful. But prior to the examination of this question, the Tribunal will briefly address Burlington's submission that this is a case of creeping expropriation.\n\n538.\n\nIn light of the conclusion that the physical occupation effected an expropriation, the Tribunal does not believe that Ecuador's measures taken together constituted a creeping expropriation. As previously noted, creeping expropriation only exists when \"none\" of the challenged measures separately constitutes expropriation. In this case, the physical takeover of the Blocks does constitute expropriation in and of itself. In *Vivendi II*, for instance, no single measure was deemed to be individually expropriatory; specifically, there was no physical takeover of the investor's operations. *Vivendi II* is thus distinguishable from this case. Hence, the definition of creeping expropriation does not appear to fit the facts of this case.\n\n539.\n\nBurlington has relied on *Revere Copper* to suggest that finding expropriation at the time of the physical takeover was too late, since the expropriation had commenced at an earlier stage. In *Revere Copper*, the tribunal held that it would be too \"narrow\"894 an interpretation to require physical impact to make a finding of expropriation. On the basis of this precedent, counsel for Burlington argued at the hearing that:\n\n\"What is significant for our purposes is the Tribunal's recognition that the cumulative impact of the inability to make rational decisions related to an investment can be as harmful to an investor as a physical, outright, troops-in weapons-out expropriation. An investor should not have to operate under conditions that substantially deprive it of the benefit of its investment before crying foul.\"895\n\nThe full passage reads as follows: \"if physical impact on a substantial portion or all of the property or on the operation of the enterprise is needed to trigger [the expropriation clause in the contract], one must ask at what point, if ever, in a complex industrial operation such as we have here, involving large investments, will the cumulative impact of the inability to make rational decisions in fact trigger this subsection? Must one wait until there has occurred something akin to the troops coming in, little by little or all at once, in a nineteenth century sense? Must there be some physical impact? In our view such narrow interpretation of the contract of insurance does not fit the realities of today and was not intended by the [contract] framers [\u2026]\", *Revere Copper* Award, at p. 60 (Exh. CL-104).\n\nTr. 79:3-10.\n\n540.\n\nThe Tribunal takes no issue with this general statement, but considers that it has no application to this case. As was previously concluded, Burlington was not operating under conditions of substantial deprivation *before* Ecuador physically occupied the Blocks. Nor is it possible to conclude that before that point Burlington had lost its ability to \"make rational decisions.\" By way of example, Burlington's decision to place the contested Law 42 payments into a segregated account while continuing to negotiate with Ecuador is but one token that such ability had not been annihilated. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not believe that this is a case of creeping expropriation.\n\n4. Was Ecuador's Expropriation Unlawful?\n----------------------------------------\n\n4.1. Positions of the Parties\n-----------------------------\n\n541.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador's expropriation was unlawful because it failed to meet the requirements of Article III(1) of the Treaty.896 It was unlawful because Ecuador failed to offer Burlington any compensation for the expropriation897 and because Ecuador contravened the general principles of treatment articulated in Article II(3) of the Treaty.898 In effect, Ecuador carried out the expropriation in a manner that was unfair and inequitable, arbitrary, and in contravention of Ecuador's specific obligations to Burlington \u2013 in particular, the tax absorption clauses.899\n\nCSM, \u00a7 III(B).\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 99-101.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 102-107.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 108-120. As per the Tribunal's previous analysis, these are in reality tax absorption clauses (see *supra* \u00b6 335).\n\n542.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, if there was expropriation, it was not unlawful.900 First, Ecuador's failure to pay compensation does not render the alleged expropriation unlawful because it is disputed whether there was an expropriation in the first place. If it is not first established that there was in fact expropriation, there is no duty to offer compensation.901 In *Goetz v. Burundi*, the tribunal refused to characterize the taking as unlawful because, in Ecuador's words, the State \"had not yet been given an opportunity to fulfill the condition of compensation.\"902 Second, at any rate, the alleged expropriation was *not* carried out in a manner that was unfair and inequitable, arbitrary, or in contravention of Ecuador's obligations to Burlington.903\n\nRCM, \u00a7 8.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 680-697.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 685.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 698-721.\n\n4.2. Analysis\n-------------\n\n543.\n\nIt is undisputed that Ecuador has neither paid nor offered compensation to Burlington. Many tribunals have held that the lack of payment is sufficient for the expropriation to be deemed unlawful.904 Ecuador asserts that it offered no compensation to Burlington because it was disputed whether there was expropriation at all. While this may have been true at the time of Law 42 and the *coactiva*, there can be no legitimate dispute that Ecuador appropriated for itself the benefits of Burlington's investment from the time of the physical takeover. There can be no dispute either that Ecuador was aware that compensation was due, for it offered to pay compensation to other oil companies when it took over their operations.905\n\n*ADC Affiliate Ltd. and ADC & ADMC Management Ltd. v. The Republic of Hungary*, Award of 2 October 2006, at \u00b6 444 (Exh. CL-101); *Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe*, Award of 22 April 2009, at \u00b6\u00b6 106-107 (Exh. CL-150); *Rumeli Telekom and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Kazakhstan*, Award of 29 July 2008, at \u00b6 706 (Exh. CL-158); *Vivendi II,* at \u00b6 7.5.21.\n\nAt the hearing, counsel for Burlington stated that \"in this one case, in this one case alone and that of Burlington's partner Perenco, Ecuador claims that no compensation needs to be paid. It argues that it may [\u2026] benefit a hundred percent from the future sales of oil produced as a consequence of the massive investments [\u2026] whilst at the same time in the most recent law, the law of [July] 2010 [], those other Contractors who have had their contracts terminated because they refused to move to a Service Contract recognized that compensation is to be payable.\" (Tr. 69:13-70:6; *see also* Tr. 120:3-7).\n\n544.\n\nIn spite of these considerations, Ecuador made no offer of compensation. The fact thus remains that Ecuador made no \"prompt, adequate and effective\" payment to compensate for the expropriation of Burlington's investment. Ecuador's reliance on *Goetz v. Burundi*,906 in which the Tribunal gave the State the option between paying compensation or withdrawing the expropriatory measure, does not change this fact. At any rate, nothing prevents Ecuador from making an offer after this decision, and possibly reaching a settlement with Burlington which would put an end to this arbitration.\n\n*Antoine Goetz and others v. Republic of Burundi*, Award of 10 February 1999 (Exh. EL-22). Ecuador relied on this precedent in its original pleading; it did not insist on its application either at the hearing or in its post-hearing brief.\n\n545.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Ecuador's expropriation was unlawful.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n546.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\nA. Denies Ecuador's request that Section III(B)(2) of Burlington's Supplemental Memorial on Liability be struck from the record;\n\nB. On the outstanding jurisdictional and admissibility issues:\n\n1.

The Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador **(\"Ecuador\").**\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn August 4, 2008, Burlington, represented by the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer **(\"Freshfields\"),** appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a to serve as arbitrator in this case. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 18 November 2008, and the proceedings began on that date.\n\n3.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session in Paris, France. On April 17, 2009, the Tribunal held a hearing on provisional measures in Washington D.C. On January 22, 2010, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris, issuing its Decision on Jurisdiction on June 2, 2010. A dissenting opinion by Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a was attached to the Decision on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal then held a hearing on liability in Paris from March 8 through 11, 2011, issuing a Decision on Liability on December 14, 2012. A dissenting opinion by Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a was attached to the Decision on Liability.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 8, 2013, Dechert (Paris) LLP **(\"Dechert\"),** counsel representing Ecuador, sent an unsigned letter (the **\"July 8 letter\")** to Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a regarding news reports stating that he had been appointed as arbitrator multiple times **(\"repeat appointments\")** by Freshfields. In this context, Ecuador asked Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a to disclose all of his appointments in cases in which Freshfields acted or acts as counsel, and in particular any cases accepted after signing his Declaration pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 on August 11, 2008 (the **\"2008 Declaration\").** Ecuador also asked for disclosure of the compensation paid in these proceedings.\n\n5.\n\nOn July 11, 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a telephone conference to discuss organizational matters **(\"the July 11 conference\").** At the end of the conference, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a enquired as to the origin of the July 8 letter, mentioning that it was not signed. Counsel for Ecuador apologized for having sent the letter unsigned, indicating that this had been an administrative mistake.\n\n6.\n\nOn July 12, 2013, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a answered the July 8 letter (the **\"July 12 response\"),** providing the list of cases requested by Ecuador.\n\n7.\n\nOn July 24, 2013, Ecuador proposed the disqualification of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (the **\"Proposal\").**\n\n8.\n\nOn July 25, 2013, the ICSID Secretariat notified the Parties that the proceedings were suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"Arbitration Rules\"****).** Professors Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler and Brigitte Stem **(\"the unchallenged arbitrators\")** were seized of the challenge pursuant to Article 58 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States **(\"the ICSID Convention\").**\n\n9.\n\nOn July 27, 2013, Burlington filed a Response to the Proposal (the **\"Response\"),** in which it proposed a briefing schedule for the disqualification procedure that would ensure the hearing scheduled to be held in August 2013 could take place. Burlington also invited the unchallenged arbitrators to issue a summary decision on the disqualification proposal, which could be supplemented at a later date.\n\n10.\n\nOn July 28, 2013, the unchallenged arbitrators invited Ecuador to comment on Burlington\u2019s proposed schedule.\n\n11.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, Ecuador submitted its comments on Burlington\u2019s proposed schedule. Besides raising arguments related to the merits of the Proposal, Ecuador acknowledged its duty to pursue its counterclaims as rapidly as possible, but stated that this duty had to \"be balanced by the need to conduct this arbitration in a fair and cost and time effective manner\". Accordingly, Ecuador proposed an alternative schedule.\n\n12.\n\nAlso on July 29, 2013, the unchallenged arbitrators fixed a calendar for the next steps in the disqualification procedure: Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a would furnish explanations pursuant to Arbitration Rule 9(3) at his earliest convenience; Ecuador would submit a reply within 5 calendar days of receipt of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s explanations; the Claimant would submit a rejoinder within 5 calendar days of receipt of the reply; and the unchallenged arbitrators would advise the Parties on further steps, including an estimated date of issuance of their decision, within 5 calendar days of receipt of the rejoinder.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 31, 2013, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a furnished his explanations. On the same day, the unchallenged arbitrators and the Parties held a telephone conference to address the calendar for the Parties\u2019 outstanding submissions on the Proposal, and the possibility of maintaining the August hearing.\n\n14.\n\nDuring the telephone conference, the Parties agreed, and the unchallenged arbitrators confirmed in a subsequent letter, that Ecuador would submit its reply by August 5, 2013, and that Burlington would file its rejoinder by August 7, 2013. At the end of the conference, the President of the Tribunal asked the Parties to address two questions in their submissions:\n\n(1) What are the applicable standards for disclosure in an ICSID arbitration and what are the consequences of a breach of the duty to disclose?\n\n(2) Do parties to an ICSID arbitration have a duty to inquire about facts that may give rise to doubts as to an arbitrator\u2019s independence and impartiality? If such a duty exists, what is its source and scope?\n\n15.\n\nOn August 5, 2013, Ecuador filed a Reply to the Proposal (the **\"Reply\")** and on August 7, 2013, Burlington filed a Rejoinder on the Proposal (the **\"Rejoinder\").**\n\n16.\n\nOn October 15, 2013, Professors Kaufmann-Kohler and Stem advised the Secretary-General of ICSID that they had failed to reach a decision on the proposal to disqualify Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a. On the same date, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the decision on the Respondent\u2019s Proposal would now be taken by the Chairman of the Administrative Council **(\"Chairman\"),** in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 21, 2013, Ecuador sent a letter to ICSID noting an LCIA Decision on Challenge of Arbitrator (LCIA Reference No. 1303). On October 24, 2013, Burlington objected to Ecuador\u2019s letter of October 21 and stated that the LCIA decision did not establish any governing principles of law as it was grounded on the specific facts of that case.\n\n**C. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------\n\n**I. Ecuador\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn July 8, 2013, Ecuador asked Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a to disclose \"all cases that [he] accepted [as arbitrator] in which Freshfields acts as counsel\", including the amount of fees received on account of those cases.1 It stated that it had become aware of repeat appointments of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a by Freshfields through an article published in an arbitration newsletter on June 20, 2013.2 This article addressed a decision on a proposal to disqualify Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a in *Rusoro* v. *Venezuela3* Ecuador stressed that Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a had not disclosed in this proceeding any appointment in cases in which Freshfields acted or acts as counsel since his appointment and declaration in 2008.\n\nEcuador's Proposal For Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a of July 24, 2013 (the **\"Proposal\"),** \u00b63.\n\nGlobal Arbitration Review, *Arbitrator survives challenge over Freshfields appointments,* published on June 20, 2013 **(Exh.

It considers this an \"excessively high number of appointments by the same law firm during such a limited period of time\".9\n\nId. **,** \u00b644.\n\n22.\n\nThe eight cases referred to in Ecuador\u2019s Proposal10 are:\n\ni. *Eni Daci\u00f3n B.V.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/04);\n\nii. *Burlington Resources, Inc.* v. *Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/05);\n\niii. *Itera International Energy LLC and Itera Group NVv.

According to published reports, the *Rusoro* tribunal rejected the challenge of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a because Venezuela had been aware of eight appointments since 2008, and a potential ninth, in cases where Freshfields acted or acts as counsel, and that the additional appointment in the *Repsol* case was not sufficient to disqualify Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a. Ecuador noted the *Rusoro* tribunal\u2019s recognition that \"excessive dependence on one law firm can be seen as undermining an arbitrator\u2019s independence, can require full disclosure, and may even lead to a successful challenge.\"11 Ecuador also asserted that \"the number of acceptable appointments needs to be determined in each case based on the circumstances.\"12\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 54.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 56.\n\n24.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s excessive dependence on Freshfields is shown by his eight appointments in ICSID cases since 2007, which undermines his independence in this case.13\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 57.\n\n25.\n\nWith respect to the second ground for disqualification, Ecuador contended that Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a failed to fulfill his duty of disclosure \"both prior to and after his appointment.\"14 Ecuador argued that at the time Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a was appointed in the present case, he did not disclose his prior or contemporaneous appointments by Freshfields in the *ENI Daci\u00f3n BV* v. *Venezuela* and *Itera* v. *Georgia* ICSID cases. Ecuador noted that subsequently, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a failed to disclose his appointments by Freshfields in five additional ICSID cases, contrary to the obligation he had assumed in his 2008 Declaration.15\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 60.\n\n*Id,* \u00b6 60-61.\n\n26.\n\nEcuador argued that Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a had adopted an inconsistent view of his duty of disclosure.16 To substantiate its allegation, Ecuador submitted Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s declaration of June 6, 2011 in *Pan American Energy* v. *Bolivia,* a case in which Dechert acted as counsel for Bolivia and in which Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a disclosed that he had been appointed as an arbitrator by Freshfields in *Itera, EVN,* and *Burlington.17*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b662.\n\nSigned Declaration of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a in the *Pan American* case, June 6, 2011 **(Exh.E-384).**\n\n27.\n\nResponding to Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s explanation that all his appointments were readily accessible on the ICSID website, Ecuador noted three points:\n\n(i) The ICSID website only started identifying counsel at the end of 2010, over two years after the 2008 Declaration;18\n\n(ii) The burden of disclosure lies on Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, who assumed a continuing obligation in his 2008 Declaration. Ecuador had no obligation to investigate an arbitrator\u2019s appointments;19\n\n(iii) Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s conduct had been inconsistent since he disclosed his Freshfields appointments in the *Rusoro* case only upon request by one party, but made such disclosure *sua sponte* in the *Pan American* case in June 2011.20\n\nProposal, \u00b6 64.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b665.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 66.\n\n28.\n\nEcuador cited decisions21 on the scope of the duty of disclosure to demonstrate that Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a was obliged to inform Ecuador of all his appointments by Freshfields.22 It relied on the following factors identified in *Suez:* (1) whether the failure to disclose was inadvertent or intentional, (2) whether it was the result of an honest exercise of discretion, (3) whether the non-disclosed facts raise obvious questions about impartiality and independence, and (4) whether the non-disclosure is an aberration on the part of a conscientious arbitrator or part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts as to impartiality.23\n\n*Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v.

For example, it noted that appointments in ICC or UNCITRAL cases are not always public, thus necessitating disclosure by the arbitrator.32 In this context, Ecuador argued that the burden of providing information is on the arbitrator, and the Parties have no obligation to obtain such information.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 18.\n\n35.\n\nEcuador argued that it had no duty to continuously investigate arbitrators in the framework of an ICSID arbitration.33 It recognized that it is standard practice to investigate arbitrators at the initial moment of their appointment, but that this practice does not create a positive duty to investigate an arbitrator throughout the proceeding.34 Furthermore, it argued that practical reasons militate against the existence of such a duty.35\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 78-94\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 87.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 87-94.\n\n36.\n\nEcuador also argued that Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s July 31 explanations were an attack on its counsel that demonstrated he had \"stepped outside of his role as arbitrator\" and could no longer be seen as a neutral decision maker.36\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 27 and 29.\n\n37.\n\nEcuador stated that Burlington failed to show that the proposal was not timely filed.37 According to Ecuador, the word \"promptly\" in Arbitration Rule 9(1) refers to \"the date of actual knowledge\" of the event.38 Ecuador argued that it only became aware of the full extent of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s appointments by Freshfields through his July 12 response. The proposal was filed on July 24, 2013, 13 days later, and hence was promptly filed.39\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 31.\n\nId. **,** \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n*Id.*, 35-36.\n\n38.\n\nFinally, Ecuador submitted that \"Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s bias has [...] become evident based on the Comments that he submitted in response to Ecuador\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification.

Burlington\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n39.\n\nBurlington responded that Ecuador\u2019s Proposal was untimely and unfounded.41 It claimed that the proposal to disqualify represented \"a transparent attempt to sabotage these proceedings\", most notably with regard to the August hearing.42\n\nBurlington's Response to Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a **(\"Response\"), \u00b6 1.**\n\n*Id.,* \u00b63.\n\n40.\n\nBurlington argued that the Proposal was belated with respect to both repeat appointments and the alleged bias during the proceedings. A proposal for disqualification must be made \"promptly\" and a failure to do so amounts to a waiver.43\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 13.\n\n41.\n\nBurlington submitted that all the information on which Ecuador relied had been public before or by February 19, 2013,44 hence the trigger for Ecuador\u2019s challenge was not June 20, 2013. It noted that Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a was appointed to the *Rusoro* case on October 15, 2012, and this fact had been public since then.45 The appointment in *Repsol,* on which Ecuador relies, was disclosed in the media on February 19, 2013, and was published on the ICSID website on or around March 6, 2013, \"about 140 days, or almost three times the delay considered sufficient to warrant dismissal of a challenge in the *Suez* case\".46 Relying on case law, and on Ecuador\u2019s own pleadings in another case47, Burlington argued that Ecuador waived its right to challenge Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a on the basis of these repeat appointments because it waited more than four months after the relevant facts became public to make this challenge.48\n\n*Id.,* \u00b62.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 15.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 13.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL Arbitration pursuant to the Ecuador-United States BIT.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n\n42.\n\nBurlington argued that the challenge based on Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s conduct during the arbitration was not promptly filed. The hearing on liability took place over two years earlier and the dissent in the Decision on Liability was issued more than six months earlier, thus the Proposal \"falls manifestly outside the scope of a \"prompt\" application for disqualification\".49\n\nId. **,** \u00b620.\n\n43.\n\nBurlington submitted that Ecuador \"misunderstands or chooses to misunderstand the party-driven nature of arbitral appointments\".50 In the present case, different parties being advised by the same law firm appointed Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a to the eight cases under scrutiny. As a result, it argued that Ecuador\u2019s Proposal \"implicitly threatens the due process right of all parties in investment arbitration to their choice of arbitrators under the ICSID Convention - and, indeed, to their choice of counsel\".51\n\nId. **,** \u00b625.\n\nId. **,** \u00b625.\n\n44.\n\nBurlington submitted that the Proposal did not reach the high standard for disqualification in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.52\n\nId. **,** \u00b6 26\n\n45.\n\nIt argued that non-disclosure of the appointment in *Repsol* does not in itself support a challenge based on repeat appointments, but merely justifies enquiring into potential economic dependence between the appointed arbitrator and the law firm.53 Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a has been appointed in more than eighty cases over his career, and has held other important functions, thus he was not economically dependent on Freshfields nor did he derive a significant portion of his income from these appointments.54 In the present case, Ecuador had made no attempt to prove such economic dependence.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b634.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b639.\n\n46.\n\nRelying on prior decisions, in particular on *Tidewater55*, Burlington argued that multiple appointments by the same party, *without more,* are not a valid ground for a challenge.56\n\n*Tidewater supra* note 21, Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stem (December 23, 2010) **(Exh. CL 299).**\n\nResponse, \u00b6 37.\n\n47.\n\nBurlington argued that Ecuador\u2019s allegations of bias in the conduct of the arbitration were without merit and \"a vexatious attempt to improperly review ordinary arbitral discretion\".57\n\n*Id.,* \u00b642.\n\n48.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Burlington reiterated that Ecuador had not provided any facts that would lead an objective observer to discern a manifest lack of independence of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a.58\n\nBurlington's Rejoinder to Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a **(\"Rejoinder\"), \u00b6** 5.\n\n49.\n\nBurlington stated that all the facts on which Ecuador relied were public for many months before Ecuador filed its Proposal. Furthermore, Burlington argued that counsel for Ecuador acknowledged that it was aware of five of the eight appointments of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a since June 2011. The sixth appointment in the *Ampal* case was published in the media on October 22, 2012; the seventh appointment in the *Rusoro* case was reported in the media on January 9, 2013; and the eighth appointment in the *Repsol* case was made public in media reports on February 19, 2013, and could be accessed on the ICSID website as of March 2013.59 Additionally, Burlington argued that each of these appointments forming the basis of the challenge - including *Rusoro, Repsol* and *Ampal -* were disclosed on the ICSID website.60\n\n*Id.,* \u00b66.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b655.\n\n50.\n\nBurlington argued that knowledge of notorious facts should be imputed to Ecuador and its specialist counsel, and that Burlington could not be asked to prove that Ecuador had knowledge of public facts.61 Burlington noted that Ecuador acknowledged that certain domestic legal systems recognize a \"should have known\" standard, and submitted that this standard should apply in the present context.62 According to Burlington, Ecuador\u2019s \"willful blindness\" is in breach of good faith.63\n\nId. **,** \u00b6 7.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 7, 49 and 50.\n\n*Ib\u00edd,* \u00b6 56.\n\n51.\n\nBurlington argued that the standard to disqualify an ICSID arbitrator is very high, that the manifest lack of independence must be established by objective evidence, and that supposition or speculation cannot substitute for proof of facts.64\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; *Opic Karimin Corporation v.

In the three relevant cases, repeat appointments by the same party, without more, did not constitute a valid ground for a challenge.67*A fortiori,* this should apply to cases where different parties appoint the same arbitrator, even if they are represented by the same law firm.68\n\n*Id.,* \u00b633.\n\n*Tidewater, supra* note 55; *OPIC supra* note 64; and *Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No.ARB/10/09), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Brigitte Stem and Prof. Guido Santiago Tawil (May 20, 2011) **(Exh.CL-301).**\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 36.\n\n54.\n\nAdditionally, Burlington argued that good faith requires parties to exercise at least minimal due diligence with respect to the relationship of arbitrators and opposing counsel. If there are facts that should have prompted a party to make further inquiry during an arbitral proceeding, the party may not later claim bias on the basis of those facts.69 According to Burlington, this reasoning is especially relevant in this case because Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s appointments were public.70 It also argued that Ecuador could easily have discovered the relevant appointments, for example by a \"Google Alert\", and thus Ecuador\u2019s challenge had not been brought in good faith.71\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 49.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 50.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 53 and 56.\n\n55.\n\nFinally, Burlington argued that upholding Ecuador\u2019s challenge on the basis of repeat appointment would have negative systemic effects for investment arbitration72 and that repeat appointments are \"a necessary part of the practice for the foreseeable future\".73\n\nId. **,** \u00b657.\n\nA/.,\u00b663.\n\n**D. PROFESSOR ORREGO VICU\u00d1A\u2019S EXPLANATIONS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nOn July 12, 2013, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a disclosed all of his Freshfields appointments, as requested by Ecuador.74 Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a also furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) on July 31, 2013.75\n\nSee *supra* \u00b6 6.\n\nSee *supra* \u00b613.\n\n57.\n\nIn his July 12 letter, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a acknowledged the duty to continuously disclose any circumstance that might raise doubts as to his independent judgment and stated that \"none of the appointments made in any way interferes with the arbitrator\u2019s independence to judge impartially\" in this case.\n\n58.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a noted that all the information requested was posted on the ICSID website. Regarding *Repsol,* Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a explained that he disclosed that appointment because a party in *Rusoro* requested a list of all his appointments, just as Dechert was doing now.\n\n59.\n\nPursuant to Ecuador\u2019s request, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a disclosed having been appointed in seven other cases since 2007 where Freshfields acted or acts as counsel: *ENI Daci\u00f3n BV* v. *Venezuela* in 2007, *Itera International Energy LLC and Itera Group* v. *Georgia* in 2008, *EVN AG* v. *Macedonia* in 2009, *Pan American Energy* v. *Bolivia* in 2011, *Ampal-American Israel Corporation* v. *Egypt* in 2012, *Rusoro Mining Ltd* v. *Venezuela* in 2012, and *Repsol, S.A. and Repsol Butano, S.A.* v. *Argentina* in 2013. He noted that *ENI Daci\u00f3n* was settled in 2008 before the tribunal was constituted, and that *Itera* and *EVN* were discontinued in the early stages of the proceedings in 2010 and 2011 respectively. He also indicated that the remaining four cases were still in the early stages of the proceedings. Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a noted that the appointments in *ENI, Itera, EVN* and *Burlington* were made more than three years ago.\n\n60.\n\nWith respect to fees earned in these arbitrations, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a did not disclose his remuneration in these cases and referred to any institutional policy which ICSID may have in respect of disclosure of fees.\n\n61.\n\nIn his July 31 explanations, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a stated as follows:\n\n\"I appreciate your invitation to comment on the proposal for disqualification that Dechert LL. P. has brought on behalf of the Government of Ecuador in respect of this arbitrator in Burlington v. Ecuador. I should state at the outset that I have had and continue to have the most harmonious and respectful relations with the government of Ecuador in many dispute settlement proceedings and other work in the field of international law and related subjects, and that at no point I have experienced the mistrust that Dechert now invokes as an over-dramatization of this challenge. The same hold true for counsel from Dechert.\n\nThese comments shall not deal with the applicable law as this aspect has already been discussed in detail by counsel for the parties. I shall restrict these comments to factual questions in respect of which I believe that counsel for Dechert is wrong.\n\nThe first such question is the alleged non-compliance with the continuing obligation to disclose potential conflicts of interest. I fully agree with this principle but, as held in many disqualification cases, the number of appointments does not per se create a conflict of interest and the circumstances of each case must be considered individually. In the circumstances of this case no such conflict of interest arises in my understanding as I have kept with my tradition of being fully independent from the parties, including financial aspects. It is thus an overstatement to argue, like Dechert does, that several appointments make highly probable that an arbitrator cannot be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment.\n\nAll my professional activities are in any event in the public knowledge, not least fully reported in the ICSID webpage and on many occasions, like in Repsol, in the press. The editors for the Global Arbitration Review will no doubt be delighted to learn that it has become a source of information capable of triggering a challenge, but the fact of the matter is that the Repsol appointment has been reported in the press for many months, including the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and the press throughout Latin America.\n\nDechert further asserts that I would have continuously supported Freshfields position in the cases to which I have been appointed by the latter. One may wonder on which information Dechert bases its conclusion in this respect, as not even I know that. In fact, the Eni case was settled before the tribunal was constituted and EVN was settled before proceedings started. The Itera case was settled during its early phase, and Pan American, Ampal, Rusoro and Repsol are also at the start-up period. That conclusion is rather based on speculation. The only case that has had a record of relevant time is Burlington.\n\nDechert also finds inconsistency in the fact that while no prior cases were reported at the time of the Burlington statement of independence made by this arbitrator in 2008, in other later cases complete listing of appointments were indicated. The reason appears to be simple. Before 2008 there were no cases, as the Eni case did not see a tribunal established in 2007 or at any time thereafter. In the following years the policy in respect of disclosing gradually changed, in part as a result of ICSID practice and in part because of the IBA Guidelines on conflicts of interest had become of common application. This is the very reason why all such information was later published in the ICSID webpage.\n\nA second issue that needs to be commented on is why only ICSID cases have been disclosed by this arbitrator in recent correspondence. The reason is still more evident. There are no other appointments by Freshfields in any other forum at any other time. Dechert, like Holey Foag did in Rusoro, has come up with a new standard in respect of appointments of judges ad-hoc to the International Court of Justice, asserting that counsel for the appointing government in a given case before that Court have to be counted among the cases in respect of which disclosure is required under arbitration proceedings.\n\nWith respect, this new purported standard is utterly wrong. Judges ad-hoc are nominated by governments but confirmed by the Court and both under the Statute and Rules of the Court they have the same obligations of impartiality and independence as any other judge. Judges ad-hoc are indeed members of the Court like any other Judge. They do not represent the nominating government and have no links of dependency with that government, least of all with any counsel that governments decide to appoint. Moreover, the Court requests comments from the other party so as to ascertain whether there could be any objection to that appointment. This has been the procedure followed in the Peru-Chile maritime delimitation dispute before that Court, which Dechert brings up as a non-ICSID case that was not reported.\n\nA third issue concerns Dechert's allegations in respect of the behavior of this arbitrator in the Burlington case, arguing that there is a blatant lack of impartiality to the detriment of Ecuador. Dechert indicates as examples of this behavior the fact that I partly dissented on the decision on jurisdiction and also partly dissented in the decision on liability. Those dissents are partial dissents and Dechert fails to note that in many other matters I concurred with the Tribunal. Neither is Dechert privy to the deliberations of the Tribunal where many other points of agreement are regularly reached.\n\nMore importantly, those dissents concern subjects on which I have long held publicly known views, in particular the interpretation of treaties, privity in international arbitration and questions concerning the umbrella clause. All of it has been addressed in scholarly publications that are well known and could hardly be regarded as views held in detriment of Ecuador. The very counsel for Dechert have cited to some of these publications in the submissions before the Tribunal when convenient to their position.\n\nArbitrators are appointed by the parties not because they favor such party but because their previously held views are considered the right ones. It is then for the tribunal to decide on which party is right or wrong, taking into account both the law and the facts of the case. I have known of no party appointing an arbitrator that holds views contrary to that party's understanding of its rights. I can assume that this is also what Dechert does when requested by a client to propose the names of likely arbitrators for appointment.\n\nDechert also complains about this arbitrator's behavior in the hearing on liability and in a recent telephone conference on pre-hearing arrangements to the hearing that had been scheduled for August. For an arbitrator to ask questions at a hearing is a fundamental right that it is not to be suppressed as otherwise only questions of the like of one party could be asked either to the parties or to their witnesses. Both parties had the opportunity to answer such questions and no complaints were made in this respect. None of it could be attributed to an intention to cast Ecuador's position in an unfavorable light as argued by counsel for Dechert.\n\nThe telephone conference is not different. This arbitrator had the right to ask about the meaning of an unsigned *ex parte* letter he had received from Dechert. It was then explained that it was meant to be signed by counsel Eduardo Silva Romero and that the fact that it had not been signed was purely an administrative mistake, for which he apologized. Now it is argued that to ask such question is a reason for disqualification. Neither to ask about the implications of that letter for the programmed hearing is in any way a form of misbehavior, particularly when the implications asked about turned to be very real.\n\nLastly there are some ethical assertions that cannot be left unanswered. Dechert admonishes this arbitrator to resign on ethical grounds as if Dechert's views were proven correct. This is certainly not the case. Moreover, the real ethical question seems to lie with Dechert's submissions and the handling of confidential information. To the best of this arbitrator's knowledge the correspondence concerning disclosure and other matters in Pan American v. Bolivia is part of the confidential record of that case. Dechert is in the knowledge of such correspondence as counsel for Bolivia, but it does not seem appropriate or ethically justified that this information be now used to the advantage of a different client of Dechert, a use that in any event should be consented to by the other party to that case.\n\nThank you again for the invitation to comment.\"\n\n62.\n\nIn summary, Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a rejected Ecuador\u2019s allegations of partiality in the course of the arbitration.\n\n**E. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n-------------------------------\n\n**I. Applicable Legal Standard**\n--------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\n*\"A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"*\n\n64.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators\".*\n\n65.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to *\"independent judgment,\"* the Spanish version requires *\"imparcialidad de juicio\"* (impartiality of judgment).76 Given that both versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.77\n\nThe French version refers to *\"ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions.\"*\n\n***Suez,*** *supra* note 21, Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (October 22, 2007), \u00b6 28 **(Exh.

Independence is characterized by the absence of external control.78 Independence and impartiality both *\"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case\"79* Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.80\n\n*Suez. supra* note 21, \u00b6 29; *Getma, supra* note 77,\u00b6 59; *ConocoPhillips, supra* note 77, \u00b6 54\n\n*ConocoPhillips, supra* note 77, \u00b6 55; *Universal supra* note 67 \u00b6 70; *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia.

Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nEcuador stated that \"the IBA Guidelines do not apply in this case\" (Proposal, note 17) and Burlington stated that \"(t)he IBA Rules on Conflicts were primarily designed for commercial arbitrations where the pool of available experienced arbitrators and the pool of competent law firms is extremely broad. The same is not true for investment arbitrations, where the pool of arbitrators and law firms with real experience is very small\" (Response, \u00b6 29).\n\n*Alpha, supra* note 77, \u00b6 56; *Urbaser supra* note 79, \u00b6 37.\n\n**II. Analysis**\n----------------\n\n70.\n\nThree grounds are invoked to disqualify Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a:\n\ni. His repeat appointments as arbitrator by Freshfields;\n\nii. His non-disclosure of these appointments in this case; and\n\niii. His conduct in these proceedings, including his dissent from the Tribunal\u2019s 2010 Decision on Jurisdiction and 2012 Decision on Liability; and his conduct during the pre-hearing telephone conference of July 11, 2013, in his July 12 response and July 31 explanations.\n\n71.\n\nArbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*\"A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.\"*\n\n72.\n\nAs stated in *Suez,* \"an orderly and fair arbitration proceeding while permitting challenges to arbitrators on specified grounds also normally requires that such challenges be made in a timely fashion.\"87\n\n*Suez, supra* note 77, \u00b6 18.\n\n73.\n\nAs the ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case by case basis. In *Urbaser,* the tribunal decided that filing a challenge within 10 days of learning of the underlying facts fulfilled the *promptness* requirement.88 In *Suez,* the tribunal held that 53 days was too long.89 In *Azurix,* the tribunal found that 8 months was too long.90 In *CDC,* a filing after 147 days was deemed untimely91 and in *Cemex,* 6 months was considered too long.92\n\n*Urbaser supra* note 79 \u00b6 19.\n\n*Suez, supra* note 77, \u00b6 26.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Tribunal (February 25, 2005) (unpublished) (reported in the Decision on Annulment, 1 September 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 35 and 269).\n\n*CDC Group PLC v. Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No.ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment (June 29, 2005)\u00b653.\n\n*CEMEX Caracas Investments B. V. and CEMEX Caracas II Investments B. V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15), Decision on proposal for Disqualification of an Arbitrator (November 6, 2009) \u00b6 41 **(Exh. CL-295).**\n\n74.\n\nIn this case the Respondent acknowledges that it knew of four of the eight appointments of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a since June 2011 [AI7V, *Itera, Burlington and Pan American].* In addition, the appointment of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a by Freshfields became public in October 2012 in the *Ampal* case, in January 2013 in the *Rusoro* case, and in February 2013 in the *Repsol* case. There is no doubt that all relevant information concerning the *Repsol, Ampal* and *Rusoro* cases was publicly available on the ICSID website before, or by, March 7, 2013.\n\n75.\n\nTaking all of these facts into consideration, the Chairman finds that the Respondent had sufficient information to file its Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a on the basis of repeat appointments and non-disclosure of such appointments well before it did so on July 24, 2013. Similarly, the Respondent knew about Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s conduct at the 2011 hearing on liability and his dissents attached to the 2010 Decision on Jurisdiction and 2012 Decision on Liability, and these were not raised promptly. As a result, the Proposal is dismissed to the extent that it relies on these grounds of challenge.\n\n76.\n\nThe challenge based on Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s conduct following the July 8 letter was raised in a timely manner. The Chairman addresses below the merits of these grounds for challenge.\n\n77.\n\nAs to Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s conduct during the July 11, 2013 teleconference, the Chairman notes the right of arbitrators to ask questions and satisfy themselves of the legal merits of the arguments put forward by the parties. The record in this case does not provide objective evidence of bias in this regard.\n\n78.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s written comments in **his July 31 explanations** are fully set out in paragraph 61 of this decision. To the extent that these comments address circumstances related to the proposal for disqualification they are relevant and appropriate, and do not provide a basis for challenge.\n\n79.\n\nHowever, in this instance, the challenged arbitrator concluded his explanations with allegations about the ethics of counsel for the Republic of Ecuador. He stated:\n\n\"[l]astly there are some ethical assertions that cannot be left unanswered. Dechert admonishes this arbitrator to resign on ethical grounds as if Dechert's views were proven correct. This is certainly not the case. Moreover, the real ethical question seems to lie with Dechert's submissions and the handling of confidential information. To the best of this arbitrator's knowledge the correspondence concerning disclosure and other matters in Pan American v. Bolivia is part of the confidential record of that case. Dechert is in the knowledge of such correspondence as counsel for Bolivia, but it does not seem appropriate or ethically justified that this information be now used to the advantage of a different client of Dechert, a use that in any event should be consented to by the other party to that case.\"\n\nSuch comments do not serve any purpose in addressing the proposal for disqualification or explaining circumstances relevant to the allegations that the arbitrator manifestly lacks independence or impartiality.\n\n80.\n\nIn the Chairman\u2019s view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the July 31, 2013 explanations would conclude that the paragraph quoted above manifestly evidences an appearance of lack of impartiality with respect to the Republic of Ecuador and its counsel. Therefore, on the facts of this case, the Chairman upholds the challenge.\n\n**F. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n81.\n\nHaving considered all of the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the Parties, and for the above reasons, the Chairman decides that the Republic of Ecuador\u2019s proposal to disqualify Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a is upheld."}, {"Title": "Decision on Counterclaims", "Type": "Counterclaims", "Date": "2017-02-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Counterclaims\n-------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS** | |\n| 2nd SMCC | Respondent [Ecuador]'s Second Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims of 24 April 2012 (corrected as of 7 May 2012) |\n| Andrade ER | Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez of 20 February 2013 |\n| API | American Petroleum Institute |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| Award | Decision on Reconsideration and Award |\n| Bed\u00f3n ER1 | 1st Expert Report of Dr. Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n of 27 September 2012 |\n| Bed\u00f3n ER2 | 2nd Expert Report of Dr. Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n of 2 July 2013 |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty; specifically \"Treaty between the United States and Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments\" of 11 May 1997 |\n| BP | British Petroleum Development Limited |\n| Burlington | Burlington Resources Inc. |\n| CEPE | Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana |\n| Civil Code or CC | Ecuadorian Civil Code |\n| CMCC | Claimant [Burlington]'s Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims of 29 September 2012 |\n| Consortium | Consortium formed by Perenco Ecuador Limited and Burlington Resources Oriente Limited |\n| CPF | Central Production Facility |\n| C-PHB | Claimant [Burlington]'s Post-Hearing Brief of 3 October 2014 |\n| C-PSVB | Claimant [Burlington]'s Post-Site Visit Brief of 15 July 2015 |\n| CPUF | Coca-Payamino Unified Field |\n| Crespo ER | Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza of 29 September 2011 |\n| Decision on Liability Decision on Jurisdiction | Decision on Liability of 14 December 2012 Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 June 2010 |\n| EIS | Environmantal Impact Study |\n| EML | Environmental Management Law (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*) |\n| ER | Expert Report |\n| Exh. | Exhibit |\n| Exh.

The Counter-Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Counter-Respondent is Burlington Resources Inc. (\"Burlington\" or the \"CounterRespondent\" or the \"Claimant\"), a corporation created under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, in 1988 and active in the exploitation of natural resources. On 31 March 2006, Burlington was acquired by ConocoPhillips, a multinational energy company with headquarters in the State of Texas, United States of America.\n\n4.\n\nThe Counter-Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Ms. Noiana Marigo, Ms. Lauren Friedman, Mr. Leon Skornicki and Ms. Giulia Previti of the law firm FRESHFIELDS BRUCKHAUS DERINGER US LLP; by Ms. Tracie Renfroe, Mr. Wade Corriell, Mr. Esteban Leccese, Ms. Jamie M. Miller, Ms. Anisha Sud and Ms. Sara McBrearty of the law firm KING & SPALDING; and by Mr. Javier Robalino-Orellana of the law firm FERRERE.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe counterclaims addressed in this decision (the \"Decision\") were filed as part of ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, which has already given rise to decisions on jurisdiction and liability and which will end by the notification of an Award shortly following this Decision.\n\n**A. Initial Phase**\n--------------------\n\n6.\n\nPursuant to Rule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Ecuador asserted two counterclaims in its Counter-Memorial on Liability of 17 January 2011. Although Burlington initially stated that it would challenge the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Parties later executed an agreement dated 26 May 2011 by which Burlington accepted the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the counterclaims.1\n\nAgreement between Burlington et al. and Ecuador dated 26 May 2011 (**Exh. E-251**).\n\n**B. Written Phase**\n--------------------\n\n7.\n\nAfter having consulted with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 on 21 July 2011 (Procedural Orders are referred to herein as \"PO\" followed by their respective numbers; for example, Procedural Order No. 8 is \"PO8\"), which referred to and annexed the Parties' jurisdictional agreement and contained the calendar for the written phase of the counterclaims proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nIn accordance with this calendar as later amended on the Parties' request, Ecuador filed a Supplemental Memorial on Counter-Claims on 30 September 2011 and a Second Supplemental Memorial on Counter-Claims on 24 April 2012. Burlington then filed its Counter-Memorial on Counter-Claims on 29 September 2012. Ecuador filed its Reply on 18 March 2013 and Burlington its Rejoinder on 8 July 2013.\n\n9.\n\nOn 6 July 2012, the Tribunal issued PO9 with regards to Burlington's request for production of documents. On 14 December 2012, the Tribunal issued PO10 with regard to Ecuador's request for production of documents. On 22 May 2013, the Tribunal issued PO13 with regard to Burlington's additional requests for production of documents.\n\n10.\n\nOn 8 April 2014, the Tribunal issued PO16 with regard to Ecuador's request to add new evidence to the record. On 16 April 2014, the Tribunal issued PO17 with regard to Burlington's request to add new evidence to the record. On 16 May 2014, the Tribunal issued PO20 with regard to Burlington's request to add new evidence in response to exhibits admitted by the Tribunal in PO16.\n\n**C. Hearing on Counterclaims**\n-------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to PO14 dated 16 July 2013, the hearing on counterclaims (the \"Hearing\") was initially set to take place from 26 August to 31 August 2013. Due to the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a submitted on 25 July 2013, the proceedings were suspended in accordance with Rule 9(6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The proceeding was resumed on 10 January 2014 following the disqualification of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a and the appointment of Mr. Stephen Drymer as arbitrator.

It was also sound-recorded and transcribed verbatim, in real time, in both English and Spanish. Copies of the sound recordings and the transcripts were delivered to the Parties. At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties held a procedural discussion in relation to posthearing matters, including the advisability and feasibility of a site inspection.\n\n**D. Post-Hearing Phase**\n-------------------------\n\n16.\n\nPursuant to PO21, and after several postponements, the Parties simultaneously filed Post-Hearing Briefs on 3 October 2014.\n\n17.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Tribunal issued PO24 with regard to Burlington's requests for production of documents, of which one request partially related to the counterclaims proceedings.\n\n**E. Site Visit**\n-----------------\n\n18.\n\nHaving secured the Parties' consent at the Hearing, the Tribunal proceeded with the inspection of a number of sites within Blocks 7 and 21 (the \"Site Visit\"). The Tribunal informed the Parties by letter of 23 July 2014 that the main objective of the Site Visit was to focus on (i) soil contamination, including issues of topography and groundwater and (ii) land use, including the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve.2 Upon the invitation and with the guidance of the Tribunal, the Parties drew up a Joint Site Visit Protocol (the \"Protocol\"). For this purpose, the Parties and the Tribunal held two telephone conferences, respectively on 8 October 2014 and 4 November 2014. The Protocol was executed by the Parties on 20 January 2015.\n\nLetter of 23 July 2014 from the Tribunal to the Parties.\n\n19.\n\nThe Protocol was incorporated into PO30 dated 25 March 2015. It set out the scope of the Site Visit, provided for the preparation of joint site information packets (\"Joint Site Packets\"), addressed pre-Site Visit inspections, detailed the Site Visit itinerary and schedule, provided for a confidentiality regime as well as immunities, and touched on miscellaneous other issues, such as transportation and security, accommodation, food, safety and health.\n\n20.\n\nUp to 12 representatives per Party were permitted to attend at each visited site.3 Counsel for the Parties were invited to make oral presentations at each site and to respond to the Tribunal's questions. The Tribunal also addressed questions to the group of experts and to the fact witness designated by each Party for a given site.4 Follow-up questions by the Parties were not allowed, subject to the Tribunal's permission under certain circumstances (such as the particular relevance of the topic and available time), which was in fact granted on many occasions.5\n\nProtocol, \u00b6 7.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 4. On Ecuador's side, IEMS was the designated expert for Yuralpa Pad A, Payamino 2/8, Payamino 1, Payamino CPF, Coca 8, Jaguar 7/8, Mono CPF, Gacela 2, Gacela 1/8, Gacela CPF and Coca 15. Mr. Crouch was the designated expert for Coca CPF and Jaguar 1. Mr. Puente was the designated fact witness for Payamino 2/8, Payamino 1, Payamino CPF, Coca CPF, Coca 8, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 7/8, Mono CPF, Gacela 2, Gacela 1/8, and Coca 15. Mr. Luna was the designated fact witness for Yuralpa Pad A and Gacela CPF. On Burlington's side, GSI was the designated expert for all sites and Mr. Saltos the designated fact witness for all sites.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 4.\n\n21.\n\nUnder the Protocol, Party presentations were considered to be in the nature of submissions and expert and witness responses to Tribunal questions were deemed to be evidence. Accordingly, the experts and witnesses who participated in the Site Visit made the declaration provided in Rule 35(2) or (3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules at the outset of the Site Visit.6\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 5.\n\n22.\n\nThe Protocol further specified that any objection regarding the conduct of the Site Visit had to be raised immediately whenever possible and at the latest at dinner time on the day when the incident complained of occurred.7 In fact, informal debriefing meetings were held each day before dinner to discuss the conduct of the Site Visit that day and to seek to agree on possible improvements.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 9.\n\n23.\n\nThe Joint Site Packets included information relating to the specific sites to be visited (for instance, excerpts from expert reports, pleadings, photographs, maps and/or historical records), their content being limited to evidence already in the record.8 The Parties agreed that no sampling was to be undertaken and that no media would be disturbed (soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water) before or during the Site Visit.9 Off platform locations could be inspected upon request and disagreements concerning the planned Site Visit were to be resolved by the Tribunal prior to the Site Visit.10\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 28.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 29.\n\n24.\n\nThe Site Visit was conducted in English and Spanish with simultaneous translations.11 It was audio- and video-recorded, the audio/video record capturing (i) the presentations by the Parties, (ii) questions from the Tribunal, (iii) answers to such questions, and (iv) any features of the sites requested by the Tribunal.12\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 30.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 31.\n\n25.\n\nThe Site Visit took place from 29 March 2015 to 1 April 2015, with 2 April 2015 in reserve. The following persons attended the Site Visit:13\n\n\u2022 For the Tribunal\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, President of the Tribunal\n\nProfessor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator\n\nMr. Stephen Drymer, Arbitrator\n\nSecretary of the Tribunal\n\nMr. Marco Tullio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor\n\nAssistant to the Tribunal\n\nMr. Magnus Jesko Langer\n\n\u2022 Ecuador's representatives\n\nDr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado Dr. Blanca G\u00f3mez de la Torre, Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado Dr. Diana Moya, Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado\n\nMr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Dechert (Paris) LLP Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, Dechert (Paris) LLP Ms. Audrey Caminades, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nMs. Gabriela Gonz\u00e1lez Gir\u00e1ldez, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\n\u2022 Burlington's representatives\n\nMs. Suzana Blades, Burlington/ConocoPhillips Mr. Rick Greiner, Burlington/ConocoPhillips Ms. Laura Robertson, Burlington/ConocoPhillips Mr. John Urby, Burlington/ConocoPhillips14 Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Ms. Tracie Renfroe, King & Spalding LLP Ms. Jamie Miller, King & Spalding LLP Mr. Thomas Norgaard, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP Mr. Javier Robalino, Paz Horowitz\n\n\u2022 Ecuador's witnesses and experts Ms. Martha Pertusa, RPS\n\nMr. Scott Crouch, Di Sorbo Consulting\n\nMr. Francisco Alfaro, IEMS\n\nMr. Henry Chaves, IEMS\n\nMr. Rodrigo Anota, IEMS\n\nMr. Marcel L\u00f3pez, IEMS\n\nMr. Marco Puente, Petroamazonas\n\nMr. Pablo Luna, Petroamazonas\n\n\u2022 Burlington's witnesses and experts Mr. John Connor, GSI Environmental Mr. Gino Bianchi, GSI Environmental\n\nMr. Danielle Kingham, GSI Environmental Mr. Wilfrido Saltos, Perenco\n\n\u2022 Technical team\n\nMr. Daniel Giglio, Interpreter Mr. Charles Roberts, Interpreter Mr. Favio Claure, AV Contractor\n\nMr. Christian Richard Winter, AV Contractor\n\nSee Joint List of Participants, submitted by Burlington on 20 March 2015, and confirmed by Ecuador on the same day. This list does not include Ecuadorian military or police personnel in charge of the security during the Site Visit.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 53 of the Protocol, Mr. Urby attended the Site Visit as security, thus not counting towards the 12 participant maximum.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties visited the following sites:\n\nOn day 1 (29 March 2015): Yuralpa Pad A;\n\nOn day 2 (30 March 2015): Payamino 2/8, Payamino 1/CPF, Coca 8 and Coca CPF;\n\nOn day 3 (31 March 2015): Jaguar 1, Jaguar 7/8 and Mono CPF;\n\nOn day 4 (1 April 2015): Gacela 2, Gacela CPF, Gacela 1/8 and Coca 15.15\n\nSite Visit Schedule annexed to the Protocol as Annex A.\n\n27.\n\nWhile the Protocol provided that there would be no record of the Site Visit other than the transcript, audio and video recordings mentioned above, it was arranged with the consent of the Parties that an official photograph be taken on day 2 at the Coca 8 site. Such photograph, reproduced below, shows the Tribunal, its Secretary and Assistant, the Party representatives and their Counsel, the experts, the fact witnesses, and the interpreters.\n\n**F. Post Site Visit Phase**\n----------------------------\n\n28.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 31 of the Protocol and paragraph 2 of PO31 dated 21 April 2015, the ICSID Secretariat made copies of the unedited audio/video recording available to the Parties on 21 April 2015. It also provided the Parties with the \"floor\" transcripts on 19 May 2015 and circulated the translated transcripts on a rolling basis from 31 May 2015 to 6 June 2015.\n\n29.\n\nBurlington objected to Ecuador's wish to make public use of the audio/video recording. The Tribunal decided that absent the consent of both Parties, under the Protocol and Regulation 22(2) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the audio/video recording and its transcript could not be made available to the public or used outside the present proceedings. However, in light of Ecuador's insistence on its duty of transparency within its domestic legal framework, the Tribunal indicated that if Ecuador wished to use the audio/video recording and/or transcript, it could apply for leave from the Tribunal by (i) identifying with precision the excerpts which it wished to use, (ii) describing the specific purpose for which the identified excerpts would be put to use, and (iii) explaining the reasons why such publication is deemed necessary.16 Ecuador did not seek leave from the Tribunal thereafter.\n\nPO31, \u00b6 9.\n\n30.\n\nIn accordance with PO31, the Parties filed Post-Site Visit Briefs on 15 July 2015. In PO31, the Tribunal had asked the Parties to jointly file certain depth-integrated maps for the sites inspected during the Site Visit so as to enable the Tribunal to more easily compare the Parties' respective delineations of the alleged contamination and of the areas to be remediated as a result. This request raised difficulties for the parties in terms of the data required to generate these maps and the potential use of data and maps not previously filed in the record. As a result, after a lengthy series of correspondence, the Tribunal advised the Parties on 12 August 2015 that, in light of such unexpected difficulties, it preferred not to receive these maps.\n\n31.\n\nFollowing the issuance on 14 August 2015 of the Interim Decision on Ecuador's Environmental Counterclaim in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. the Republic of Ecuador* (\"*Perenco v. Ecuador*\"), the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their comments on that decision, which they did on 18 September 2015.\n\n32.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal provided the Parties with status reports on its progress on 13 November 2015, on 25 February 2016, on 27 July 2016 and on 29 November 2016. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Parties filed their cost submissions on 2 May 2016, and their reply submissions on 23 May 2016.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 18 January 2017, Ecuador requested leave from the Tribunal to submit the audio and video recording of the site visit to Blocks 7 and 21 conducted in *Perenco v. Ecuador*. By letter of 20 January 2017, Burlington objected to Ecuador's request. After due deliberation, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that the submission of the audio and video recording of the site visit in *Perenco v. Ecuador* would not assist the resolution of the counterclaims in these proceedings. Accordingly, by letter of 25 January 2017, the Tribunal denied Ecuador's request to file the audio and video recording of the *Perenco* site visit into the record of this arbitration. Further, by means of the same letter, the Tribunal, declared the proceedings closed as of 25 January 2017 in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**III. GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING BLOCKS 7 AND 21**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nTo the extent relevant for purposes of the counterclaims, the descriptions of fact contained in decisions previously rendered in this arbitration, i.e. the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability, are incorporated into the present Decision. Similarly, terms and abbreviations used there are used here with the same meaning.\n\n35.\n\nThis section addresses various characteristics of Blocks 7 and 21 not previously discussed, in particular as regards their geography and the oilfield operations that have been conducted in the Blocks, including by Petroamazonas after July 2009. It is based on allegations of facts that were not disputed or on facts that the Tribunal considers established. Where a fact referred to has been disputed it is noted as such.\n\n36.\n\nBlocks 7 and 21 are located in the provinces of Francisco de Orellana, Napo and Pastaza, in the Amazon region of the Ecuadorian Oriente.17 Situated east of the Andean mountains in North-Eastern Ecuador, the Oriente is located in a slightly undulated plain between 200 and 350 meters above sea-level, characterized by the presence of swamps and numerous water bodies flowing into the Napo River.18\n\n**Topographic Map of Blocks 7 and 21**19\n\nIEMS ER1, p. 8, Section 2.1.\n\n*Id*., p. 11, Section 2.3.2.\n\nMap taken from: HSE & SD Assessment and other Technical Services, *Assets in Ecuador*, November 2006, p. 76 (**Exh.

Block 7 (including the Coca-Payamino Unified Field)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nBlock 7 and the Coca-Payamino Unified Field (the \"CPUF\"), which extends to the northeast of Block 7, cover an area of nearly 2,000 square kilometers located approximately 160 kilometers east of the capital Quito.\n\n38.\n\nIt is also a relatively populated area: the city of Francisco de Orellana (also known as \"Coca\"), capital of Orellana province, is located on this Block at the confluence of the Napo, Coca and Payamino Rivers.20 Orellana province has a population of 136,000, of which about 73,000 live in the city of Coca.21 Coca is the main hub for oilfield contractors and functions as the platform for numerous oilfield operations throughout the region.

The term \"SNAP\" in the map's legend refers to the Ecuadorian system of nationally protected areas *(Sistema nacional de \u00e1reas protegidas).*\n\n40.\n\nOther than some exploratory wells, such as Zorro and C\u00f3ndor, which were drilled by Texaco in the 1970s, Block 7 was first developed by British Petroleum Development Limited (\"British Petroleum\" or \"BP\") under a Service Contract concluded in December 1985 (\"Service Contract\") with the then Ecuadorian State Petroleum Corporation (*Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* ; \"CEPE\").26 At that time, Block 7 did not include the Coca field or the portion of the Payamino field that extended to the north of Block 7 and that were operated by CEPE.27 Following BP's 1986 discovery of oil in the Payamino field, in the northeastern corner of Block 7,28 CEPE's drilling of the Payamino 2 well in 1987 and the drilling by CEPE's upstream subsidiary Petroproducci\u00f3n of the Coca 4 and Coca 7 wells, the conclusion was reached in 1989 that the oil reservoir from the Payamino field extended beyond the borders of Block 7 into the Coca field, thus forming a \"common oil deposit\".29\n\nOn 18 December 1985, the Ecuador State Petroleum Corporation (\"CEPE\") and BP entered into a Services Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block Seven of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region. Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region, 18 December 1985 (**Exh. CE-CC-4** ; **Exh. P-5**).

Oryx operated the CPUF between February 1994 and June 1997, and Petroproducci\u00f3n reassumed operations from June 1997 through February 2000.32\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 58-63; Saltos WS1, \u00b6 36.\n\nOperational Agreement for Unified Exploration of the Common Fields Basal Tena, Napo \"U\", Holl\u00edn Superior and Holl\u00edn Principal of the Coca-Payamino Field, 20 July 1990 (**Exh.

In 1993, Santa Fe Minerales del Ecuador, S.A. (\"Santa Fe\"), Sociedad Internacional Petrolera (\"Sipetrol\") and Sigdoil, S.A. (later renamed Compa\u00f1\u00eda Latinoamericana Petrolera Numero Dos, S.A. or \"Clapsa II\") acquired interests in the Service Contract.35 In 1995, Santa Fe transferred its rights to Preussag Energie GmbH (\"Preussag\").36\n\nThe Zorro field was never put into production.\n\nSaltos WS1, \u00b6 28, item 3.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 28, item 4; SMCC, note 49. See also: Block 7 Participation Contract, Clause 2.4 (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation**).\n\n44.\n\nIn 1999, Oryx became Kerr McGee Ecuador Energy Corporation (\"Kerr McGee\" or \"KmG\").37 In March 2000, an amendment to the Service Contract was executed and the contractual framework was migrated into a Production Sharing Contract (\"PSC\"), which was entered into between Petroecuador on the one hand, and Kerr McGee, Preussag, Sipetrol and Clapsa II on the other hand, for the joint operation of Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino Unified Field.38 As a result of that transaction, Kerr McGee became the joint operator of Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, and the two areas have been jointly administered ever since.39 Under the Participation Contract, the Contractor companies were to invest in the Block at their own risk in exchange for a share of the crude oil produced.40\n\nSaltos WS1, \u00b6 28, item 5; CMCC, \u00b6 87.\n\nIn March 2000, the consortium between KmG, Preussag, Sipetrol and Clapsa II entered into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block 7 of the Ecuadorian Amazonian Region (**Exh. CE-CC-28**). Saltos WS1, \u00b6 28, item 6; CMCC, \u00b6 88; SMCC, \u00b6 70.\n\nSMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 65-71.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 88. With respect to the Coca-Payamino field, a joint operating agreement was entered into in May 2000, pursuant to which Kerr McGee, as operator of Block 7, took on the operation of the Coca-Payamino field. Save for the allocated percentage of production, all rights and obligations in the Block 7 PSC were incorporated into the Coca-Payamino Agreement. SMCC, \u00b6 71.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Ecuador's Position and Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nEcuador's case on the counterclaims can essentially be summarized as follows:\n\ni. Under Ecuadorian law, Burlington is strictly liable for any environmental damage found in Blocks 7 and 21. There is environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21 in the form of significant soil and groundwater pollution. IEMS, Ecuador's environmental experts, discovered that close to 2.5 million cubic meters of soil and all groundwater locations tested (18) are polluted with hydrocarbons, heavy metals or both. Burlington is liable for this damage.\n\nii. Under the PSCs and Ecuadorian law, Burlington was bound to maintain the infrastructure, and return it to Ecuador, in good working condition in accordance with industry standards. Burlington breached this obligation and is thus liable.\n\niii. As a result of these breaches, Burlington must pay damages to Ecuador in the total amount of USD 2,797,007,091.42 composed of USD 2,507,107,626 for soil remediation and USD 265,601,700 for groundwater remediation, USD 3,380,000 to complete groundwater studies, USD 3,500,000 for the abandonment of wells in Block 7, and USD 17,417,765.42 for infrastructure damage,58 plus interest and costs.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 1014-1017.\n\n53.\n\nOn this basis, in its Post-Hearing Brief, Ecuador requests that the Tribunal to render an award:\n\n1. Declaring\n\n(i) That Burlington is liable towards Ecuador for the costs of restoring the environment in areas within Blocks 7 and 21 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region;\n\n(ii) That Burlington is liable towards Ecuador for the costs required to remedy the poor state of the infrastructure of Blocks 7 and 21 left behind by Burlington;\n\n2. Ordering\n\n(i) Burlington to pay damages to allow the State to proceed with full restoration of the environment in areas within Blocks 7 and 21 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region quantified at USD 2,507,107,626 (or, alternatively, USD 790,465,298) for soil clean up costs and USD 265,601,700 for groundwater remediation costs;\n\n(ii) Burlington to pay the costs for Ecuador to complete groundwater studies in 52 additional locations quantified at USD 3,380,000;\n\n(iii) Burlington to pay the costs of abandonment of wells in Block 7, quantified at USD 3,500,000;\n\n(iv) Burlington to pay damages for its failure to return the Blocks' infrastructure in good condition to Ecuador in an amount quantified at USD 17,417,765.42 with interest at an adequate commercial interest rate from the date of disbursement thereof until the date of the Award;\n\n(v) Burlington to pay all the costs and expenses incurred in this arbitration in connection with Ecuador's counterclaims, including but not limited to Ecuador's legal and expert fees and costs and ICSID's other costs; and\n\n(vi) Claimant to pay interest at an adequate commercial interest rate on all amounts stated in the preceding paragraphs from the date of the Award until the date of full payment; and\n\n3. Awarding\n\n(i) Such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.59\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 1012-1020.\n\n54.\n\nIn its Post-Site Visit Brief, Ecuador has expressly maintained these prayers for relief.60\n\nR-PSVB, \u00b6 14.\n\n**B. Burlington's Position and Request for Relief**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIn essence, Burlington makes the following submissions:\n\ni. Ecuador's multi-billion environmental claim is no more than tactical retaliation fabricated after Burlington lodged its ICSID claim, with the objective of offsetting the significant damages that are owed to Burlington by Ecuador for its unlawful seizure of the Blocks.61 Similarly, the infrastructure claim is opportunistic and lacks merit.62 It was fabricated to provide additional support for Ecuador's environmental claim. Not satisfied in having cashed in over USD 4 billion in \"unanticipated\" oil revenues from the seizure of the Blocks, Ecuador now seeks USD 2.6 billion for an alleged \"tremendous environmental harm\" caused by a \"series of small incidents\", and an additional USD 17 million to upgrade infrastructure it took from the Consortium.63\n\nii. Ecuador in fact seeks to impose on Burlington responsibility for environmental conditions preexisting the Consortium's operation of Blocks 7 and 21, and even preexisting any human activity on the Blocks. Moreover, whatever environmental damage may be present in the Blocks today is the result of, or has been severely exacerbated by, Ecuador's own operation and indeed expansion of oilfield operations.\n\niii. Ecuador's claims must be rejected *in toto*, since Ecuador relies on invented legal tests that have never been applied in practice and are scientifically unsupported. Alternatively, the Tribunal should evaluate the reasonable costs of remediating \"the pockets of exceedances at the two sites that are possibly attributable to the Consortium, as would have occurred in a normal orderly handover, absent Ecuador's unlawful actions\".64 These costs amount to USD 1.09 million and include the remediation of Yuralpa Pad A and Jaguar 1 Area 3T.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 2.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 228.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 1.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 13.\n\n56.\n\nAccordingly, in its Post-Hearing Brief, Burlington requests the Tribunal to grant the following relief:\n\n(a) DISMISS with prejudice Ecuador's environmental counterclaims in their entirety;\n\n(b) In the alternative, determine that the reasonable cost of remediating the exceedances possibly attributable to the Consortium, including the costs of closing four pits and abandoning seven wells is no more than USD 1.09 million;\n\n(c) DECLARE that, beyond the exceedances assessed by the Tribunal, Burlington has no further liability for environmental harm in Blocks 7 and 21;\n\n(d) DISMISS with prejudice Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims in their entirety;\n\n(e) ORDER Ecuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Burlington's legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, and ICSID's other costs;\n\n(f) ORDER Ecuador to pay compound interest on the sum awarded in (e) above, until the date of effective and complete payment, at a rate of 4 percent compounded annually, or at such a rate and for such a period of compounding as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate in the circumstances; and\n\n(g) AWARD such further and other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.65\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 277.\n\n57.\n\nThe Post-Site Visit Brief did not change these requests for relief.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n58.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' extensive submissions as well as the very extensive evidentiary record, including the evidence gathered during the Site Visit, the Tribunal now proceeds with its analysis of the counterclaims. It will first address various preliminary matters (Section A). Thereafter, it will review Ecuador's environmental counterclaims (Section B) and then turn to the infrastructure counterclaims (Section C) before concluding on the counterclaims, including on the avoidance of double recovery in connection with the counterclaims pending against Burlington's consortium partner Perenco (D). Finally, the Tribunal will discuss interest (VI) and costs (VII) before setting out its decision (VIII).\n\n**A. Preliminary Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe present section deals with (1) the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the counterclaims, (2) the scope of this Decision, (3) the relation between this arbitration and the *Perenco* arbitration, (4) the law applicable to the merits of Ecuador's counterclaims, and (5) certain evidentiary matters.\n\n**1. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of Ecuador's counterclaims is not challenged, and rightly so. As noted in PO8, it derives from an agreement entered into by the Parties on 26 May 2011.66 In this agreement, Burlington and Ecuador expressed their agreement and consent that this arbitration is the \"appropriate forum for the final resolution of the Counterclaims arising out of the investments made by Burlington Resources and its affiliates in Blocks 7 and 21, so as to ensure maximum judicial economy and consistency\".67\n\nAgreement between Burlington et al. and Ecuador, 26 May 2011 (**Exh. E-251**). See also: SMCC, \u00b6 6.\n\nAgreement between Burlington et al. and Ecuador, 26 May 2011 (**Exh. E-251**), introductory clause 9.\n\n61.\n\nBurlington committed not to raise any jurisdictional objections.68 The Parties further agreed that (i) the Tribunal's decision would be final and binding,69 (ii) Ecuador (including its emanations, agencies, instrumentalities, subdivisions and controlled corporations) waived its right to file the counterclaims against Burlington, its subsidiaries or any other corporation in the ConocoPhillips Group before \"any jurisdiction whatsoever whether arbitral or judicial, national or international except for this Arbitration\".70\n\n*Id*., operative clause (a).\n\n*Id*., operative clause (b).\n\n*Id*., operative clause (c).\n\n62.\n\nSince the agreement just described deals with jurisdiction over counterclaims, one must in addition refer to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention. Article 46 allows for counterclaims \"arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\".71 These conditions are met here: (i) the counterclaims arise directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, namely Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21; (ii) they are within the scope of the Parties' consent to ICSID arbitration which is manifested in the agreement just referred to; and (iii) they also fall within the jurisdiction of the Centre as circumscribed by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (legal dispute arising out of an investment, and nationality requirement).\n\nICSID Convention, Article 46.\n\n**2. Scope of this Decision**\n-----------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThis Decision resolves one part of the dispute which forms the subject matter of this arbitration, namely Ecuador's environmental and infrastructure counterclaims raised in the course of the proceedings over Burlington's claims against Ecuador. Burlington's claims, which form the other part of this dispute, have been dealt with in part in the Decision on Jurisdiction of 31 May 2010 and the Decision on Liability of 14 December 2012. Ecuador's request for reconsideration of the latter decision as well as the quantification of Burlington's claims will be settled in the forthcoming Award.\n\n**3. Relation with the Perenco arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn the separate ICSID arbitration initiated by Burlington's Consortium partner, Perenco, Ecuador has raised counterclaims essentially resting upon the same facts and legal arguments as those before this Tribunal. On 11 August 2015, the *Perenco* tribunal issued an Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim (the \"*Perenco* Decision\"), in which it ruled on certain issues of fact and law with a view to narrowing its analysis of the counterclaims.72\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador* (\"*Perenco v. Ecuador*\"), ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim of 11 August 2015. The *Perenco* tribunal also addressed a number of subsidiary issues.\n\n65.\n\nWhile the evidence gathered in the two proceedings was not identical, among other things, in terms of the witnesses heard,73 it remains that the two arbitrations essentially deal with the same alleged damages. Not surprisingly, questions thus arose during the arbitration on the relation between these two parallel proceedings, in particular in respect of (i) their potential consolidation or other \"coordination\" between the two tribunals, (ii) the admissibility in these proceedings of submissions and testimony presented in the *Perenco* arbitration (including transcripts from that arbitration), (iii) the impact of the *Perenco* Decision on this Tribunal's decision-making, and (iv) the risk of double recovery.\n\nEcuador's Letter of 10 April 2014 to the Tribunal, p. 3 (mentioning that witnesses Mr. Gilberto Martinez, Mr. Courteaud and Mr. Hoffman were heard in the *Perenco* arbitration but not in this arbitration).\n\n66.\n\nWith respect to item (i), Ecuador opposed the possibility of a consolidation of the counterclaim proceedings.74 While acknowledging that the two arbitrations were \"parallel\", Ecuador disagreed with Burlington that they were \"nearly identical\".75 At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal enquired whether the Parties would accept some level of coordination between the two tribunals.76 Subject to consulting with Perenco, Burlington was in favor of such coordination if it could reduce the risk of contradictory decisions.77 By contrast, Ecuador maintained its opposition to consolidation and stated that it was \"too late\" for a coordination between the two tribunals.78 Lacking the consent of the Parties, the Tribunal had no choice but to refrain from any coordination with the *Perenco* tribunal.\n\nLetter of 10 April 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 3, citing the letter of 6 June 2012 from Ecuador to the Perenco tribunal (**Exh. E-520**). The Tribunal notes that, even if the Parties had agreed to consolidation or coordination, it would still have remained necessary to approach both Perenco and the *Perenco* tribunal.\n\nLetter of 10 April 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 3. See also: Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2357:1320 (Tribunal, Silva Romero): \"The first comment is that these cases, Perenco and Burlington on the counterclaims have evolved very differently. The arguments are not exactly the same in both cases. The evidence is not exactly the same. Both tribunals have made decisions as to new documents. There are documents that were admitted by the Perenco Tribunal that were not admitted by this Tribunal\".\n\nTr. (Day 6) (ENG), 2161:1-20; Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2353:4-6.\n\nTr.

(Day 7) (ENG), 2356:11-2358:13 (Tribunal, Silva Romero).\n\n67.\n\nIn connection with item (ii) above, the issue arose whether the Parties could rely on the transcripts of the *Perenco* hearing. Ecuador opposed the introduction into the record of the *Perenco* transcripts on the grounds that it \"would threaten the structural integrity of the [present arbitration, as well as] violate the separate identity of the proceedings and create an unacceptable risk of pre-judgment\".79 Following various exchanges, the Parties agreed to admit the *Perenco* transcripts, but only for impeachment purposes during cross-examination of each other's witnesses.80 Accordingly, except for a few instances where specific passages of the *Perenco* transcript were used for this purpose at the Hearing, the *Perenco* transcripts are not part of this record.81\n\nLetter of 10 April 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 1. See also: Letter of 31 March 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, pp. 2-3; Letter of 21 March 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 2; Letter of 14 March 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 4. Ecuador further specified that the introduction into the record of a letter of 3 June 2009 from counsel to Perenco to counsel to Ecuador relating to the so-called \"Suspension Plan\" (**Exh. E-311**) and other documents obtained through document productions in the *Perenco* arbitration (**Exhs. E-433, E-434, E-464, E-467, E-468, E-469, E-470** and **E-471**) \"should not constitute a basis for the introduction\" of the *Perenco* transcripts. Letter of 10 April 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 4.\n\nLetter of 28 April 2014 from the Tribunal to the Parties. On this issue, see for instance, the discussions during the Hearing: Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 348:16-352:14.\n\nThis said, the Tribunal notes that certain decisions, witness statements, expert reports and other documents from the *Perenco* proceedings have been filed in this arbitration, especially in the context of the phases dealing with Burlington's claims.\n\n68.\n\nThe Parties were asked to comment on the third issue, concerning the impact of the *Perenco* Decision on this case, after that decision was rendered. In its comments dated 18 September 2015, Ecuador reiterated that the two sets of proceedings are separate and invited the Tribunal to consider only the arguments and evidence before it in this present arbitration.82 For its part, Burlington commented that the *Perenco* Decision \"substantially narrowed the disputed issues\" and therefore invited the Tribunal to carefully assess that decision's conclusions.83 Burlington further stated that the Site Visit effectively eliminated the need to appoint an independent expert or to engage in further fact-finding.84\n\nLetter of 18 September 2015 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 2.\n\nLetter of 18 September 2015 from Burlington to the Tribunal, pp. 1-2.\n\n*Id*., p. 4.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the separate nature of the two arbitrations and of its duty to resolve the dispute before it solely on its own record and merits. This said, the Tribunal is also mindful of the risk of double recovery, to which it will revert, and of the potential risk of contradictory decisions. For reasons linked to the value of coherence of the legal system, it considers that contradictory decisions on identical issues should be avoided to the degree possible without sacrificing any party's rights of due process or fairness. While ruling on the basis of the record in this case exclusively, the Tribunal will refer to the *Perenco* Decision in those instances where, in spite of the desire to avoid contradictions, it reaches a conclusion different from that of the *Perenco* tribunal.\n\n70.\n\nAs regards the risk of double recovery (item (iv) above), Ecuador does not dispute that it seeks what Burlington calls \"identical overlapping compensation with regard to the same alleged damage\" in both proceedings.85 It also agrees that there is a risk of double recovery.86 This being so, at the end of the Hearing, Ecuador explained that it does not intend to recover its claimed damages twice, but that it will rely on whichever decision proves to be more favorable to its position.87 Burlington, on its part, requested that the Tribunal expressly address the risk of double recovery, such that \"if the dispositive part of either of the awards on counterclaims provides for any compensation, Ecuador would be prevented from enforcing the second award to the extent that it has already been compensated by the first\".88 The Tribunal addresses double recovery below (Section D).\n\nTr.

(Day 7) (ENG), 2358:14-17 and 2359:7-11 (Tribunal, Silva Romero).\n\nLetter of 18 September 2015 from Burlington to the Tribunal, p. 2.\n\n**4. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe law governing the conduct of the procedure on the counterclaims is addressed in the rules of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the Tribunal's procedural orders, in particular PO8 (Proceedings on Counterclaims), PO14 (Hearing on Counterclaims), PO21 (Post-Hearing Matters), PO30 (Site Visit), and PO31 (Post Site Visit Matters).\n\n72.\n\nAs regards the substance of the dispute, it is undisputed that Ecuadorian law applies to both the environmental and the infrastructure counterclaims. This being so, there is no common ground between the Parties with respect to the applicability to the environmental counterclaims of the Block 7 and Block 21 PSCs and the relevance of international law.\n\n73.\n\nWith respect to the environmental counterclaims, Ecuador affirmed throughout the proceedings that its action is solely based on Ecuadorian tort law, as opposed to contract law, although it relies on several provisions of the PSCs to support its interpretation of the strict liability regime under Ecuadorian law.89\n\nSee, for instance: Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 27:12-15 (Opening, Silva Romero), 301:22-302:7, 303:4-20 (Tribunal, Silva Romero).\n\n74.\n\nAccording to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal shall decide the dispute \"in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties\", absent which \"the Tribunal shall apply the law of the [host State] \u2026 and such rules of international law as may be applicable\".90 Here, Ecuador brings a tort action, and neither Party has argued that the choice of (Ecuadorian) law in the PSCs encompasses torts. Therefore, the Tribunal will apply Ecuadorian tort law, not as the law chosen by the Parties under the first leg of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, but as the law of the host State under the second leg of that provision. The relevance of this distinction is that, under the second leg, international law also \"may be applicable\". According to prevailing case law,91 it is left to the Tribunal's discretion to apply either municipal or international law depending on the type of issue to be resolved. Subject to any particular matter that may call for the application of international law, which will be discussed if and when it arises in the analysis, the Tribunal will thus apply Ecuadorian law to the environmental counterclaims. The fact that the dispute is governed by tort law does not mean, however, that the Tribunal may not look to the PSCs to inform its understanding of the obligations assumed by the Consortium in terms of environmental stewardship.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 42(1).\n\n*Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award of 15 April 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117; *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability of 14 December 2012, \u00b6 179; *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award of 8 December 2000, p. 911.\n\n75.\n\nWith respect to the infrastructure counterclaims, Ecuador argues that Burlington's liability for the poor condition of the infrastructure arises both under the Block 7 and 21 PSCs and under Ecuadorian law.92 In this regard, the PSCs contain a choice of Ecuadorian law and, accordingly, the Tribunal will apply such law (under the first leg of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention) as well as any relevant contractual provisions of the PSCs.\n\nSMCC, \u00b6 14.\n\n**5. Assessment of evidence**\n-----------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAt the Hearing, in accordance with its powers in evidentiary matters, the Tribunal suggested to the Parties that an inspection of various sites would assist its understanding of several key issues connected to the environmental counterclaims, such as soil and groundwater contamination, the experts' sampling programs, land use, the topography of the Blocks and specific sites, and the extensive modelling and delineation employed by the Parties' respective experts. As discussed above, both Parties having given their consent prior to the close of the Hearing, the Tribunal decided to conduct a Site Visit in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(b).93\n\nSee above paragraph 18.\n\n77.\n\nFurther, in light of the technical nature of many of the factual issues at stake in the environmental counterclaims, including issues explored during the Site Visit, the Tribunal put to the Parties whether, in their view, it should seek the assistance of a Tribunal-appointed expert in addition to the experts offered by the Parties. The Tribunal ultimately concluded in the negative, because (i) neither Party requested the appointment of a Tribunal expert (for example, Burlington stated that with the benefit of the Site Visit it considered that the Tribunal was fully equipped to decide the environmental counterclaims \"without the need for an independent expert or additional fact finding\"),94 (ii) it had before it extensive evidence from qualified experts, (iii) it also had detailed evidence from fact witnesses, including persons with long-time familiarity with the fields, (iv) it had visited relevant sites and had thus acquired a further, firsthand, visual understanding of the physical environment in which the oil exploration and production operations were conducted, of the situation of the platforms and the other installations, and of the terrain and areas modelled and delineated by the experts. In addition, (v) developing and engaging in a process involving a Tribunal-appointed expert would have caused delays and costs which the Tribunal considered would be disproportionate to the possible usefulness of such an exercise in the circumstances, and contrary to the Tribunal's duty of efficiency.\n\nLetter of 18 September 2015 from Burlington to the Tribunal, p. 2. At the Hearing, Burlington indicated that the appointment of an independent expert would fall within the discretion of the Tribunal, but that with the benefit of a site visit the Tribunal could further obtain evidence from the Parties' experts. The appointment of an independent expert might only become necessary once the Tribunal decided the legal framework and some technical questions would still remain unclear. Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2362:5-2363:7 (Tribunal, Blackaby). For its part, Ecuador stated at the Hearing that the decision to appoint an independent expert fell within the discretionary powers of the Tribunal, and in its letter of 18 September 2015, Ecuador did not opine on the appointment of an independent expert. Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2367:10-13 (Tribunal, Silva Romero); Letter of 18 September 2015 from Ecuador to the Tribunal.\n\n78.\n\nSeveral issues also arose in the context of the document production exercise, which will be addressed if and to the extent relevant to the Tribunal's analysis of particular claims or submissions discussed later in this Decision.\n\n**B. Environmental Counterclaims**\n----------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ecuador claims that the Consortium abandoned Blocks 7 and 21 leaving behind a massive environmental catastrophe, a claim which Burlington strongly denies (save for an admission of liability in an amount of approximately USD 1.09 million). The Parties are in sharp disagreement on nearly all issues of fact and law raised by these counterclaims. To untangle this disagreement, the Tribunal will first set out the Parties' positions on matters of law (Section 1). It will then review the regulatory framework applicable to oilfield operations in Ecuador, in particular as it relates to environmental protection and stewardship (Section 2). This will then allow the Tribunal to assess the legal positions advocated by the Parties (Section 3). In the light of this assessment of the law, the Tribunal will thereafter summarize the Parties' positions on the facts and proceed to analyze such facts on soil contamination (Section 4), mud pits (Section 5), groundwater (Section 6), and well site abandonment (Section 7).\n\n**1. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**1.1 Ecuador's position**\n--------------------------\n\n**1.1.1 Burlington is liable for all environmental harm in Blocks 7 and 21**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, Burlington is incorrect when alleging, and in any event it fails to establish, that Ecuador's counterclaims are a mere set-off strategy. As Professor Crespo explained at the Hearing, Ecuador's position in and approach to these proceedings are proof that Ecuador is pursuing its constitutional obligation to vindicate any environmental harm caused by the Consortium in Blocks 7 and 21.95 Furthermore, Burlington's novel theory on sustainable development does not withstand scrutiny. Sustainable development cannot amount to a \"license to pollute\".96 Quite to the contrary, this principle encompasses the polluter-pays principle, and Ecuador only allowed oil operations to be carried out because such operations are highly regulated and any environmental harm must be fully restored under the maxim *ubi emolumentum,* *ibi onus*.97 If one were to accept Burlington's permissible limits theory, it would signify that \"the Ecuadorian environment and the society at large will be forced to assume part of the costs of Burlington's oil activities [\u2026]\"; an unacceptable position.98 As stated by Professor Crespo, sustainable development implies that operators internalize environmental costs.99\n\nTr. (Day 2) (ENG), 343:10-15 (Cross, Crespo): \"Well, not only through sanctions, but also through demanding that actions be taken completely restoring an environmental harm or imposing administrative penalties to dissuade the economic activities so as to prevent environmental harm\".\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 44.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 46.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nTr. (Day 2) (ENG), 328:9-18 (Direct, Crespo): \"And in closing, I would like to say sustainable development, as I said at the beginning, does not mean that the environment is harmed. It means that one needs to guarantee the environment [\u2026] internalizing costs [of] economic activities\".\n\n**1.1.2 Burlington is strictly liable for any environmental harm found in Blocks 7 and 21**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, under the 2008 Constitution, oil operators bear strict liability for environmental harm. Strict liability means that oil operators are liable upon a mere showing of environmental harm in the areas where they performed oil operations. The State need not prove that the oil operator is at fault, nor that there is a causal nexus between a breach of the duty of care and the environmental damage.100\n\nSMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23.\n\n82.\n\nUnder the strict liability regime, the State must only prove the existence of an economic activity in the relevant area entailing serious risks to the environment and a negative impact on the environment of the type that comes with such perilous economic activity. For Ecuador, Burlington is wrong in seeking to downplay the significance of the impact of its operations on the environment. Indeed, Burlington's \"*significant admission\"* of liability to restore soils in the amount to USD 10 million is itself a manifestation of a \"significant impact\".101\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 36.\n\n**1.1.3 The 2008 Constitution applies to damage discovered after its entry into force**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nIn terms of temporal application, Ecuador submits that the 2008 Constitution applies to any environmental harm discovered after its entry into force, no matter when the harm actually occurred. Burlington did not contradict Ecuador's legal experts, Professors Crespo and Andrade, who stated that the 2008 Constitution applies, at the very least, to all environmental harm that occurred after its entry into force. This follows from Articles 11.3 (direct application)102 and 396 of the 2008 Constitution (strict liability for environmental torts), the latter providing for full reparation of any environmental harm (\"*todo da\u00f1o al ambiente*\").\n\nOn the notion of direct application, Ecuador refers to Doyen Roubier's distinction between dynamic situations and static situations. \"A new law cannot govern a situation or phase that has ended. Conversely, a new law can govern a situation that started before its enactment but which is not yet ended. Environmental harm, *i.e.* continuing harm, is precisely an example of a dynamic situation\". R-PHB, \u00b6 52, note 63.\n\n84.\n\nProfessor Bed\u00f3n, Burlington's expert, also did not deny that the 2008 Constitution could apply to environmental harm preceding the entry into force of the Constitution if a particular norm dictated its application.103 Such norm does exist, so argues Ecuador, as the court confirmed in *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* in reliance on the principle *in dubio pro natura* (enshrined in Article 395(4) of the 2008 Constitution),104 in the following terms:\n\n\"It is important that we highlight that the constitutional principal [sic] that states that in doubt, the rule that most favors environmental protection shall apply, as it is a standard that generates ample protection, the matters contemplated by the current Constitution will apply, as it is a standard that creates a broad protection to the environment, above the matters outlined by the Environmental Management Law or the 1998 Constitution. The provisions of the current Constitution as it relates to environmental issues and its protection is also preferably applied, since, in procedural matters, the rules in force at the time of filing the action apply, and not those that were in force when the legal situation was created\".105\n\nSee R-PHB, \u00b6 54, referring to: Tr. (Day 2) (ESP), 624:18-625:3 (Cross, Bed\u00f3n), corresponding to Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 599:14-21 (Cross, Bed\u00f3n).\n\nArticle 395(4) of the 2008 Constitution (**Exh. P-12**) : \"In case of doubt as to the scope of legal provisions on environmental matters, these shall be applied within the meaning most favorable to nature's protection\" (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 55. *Nelson Alc\u00edvar v OCP,* Corte Provincial de Justicia, 2011, \u00b6 12 (**Andrade ER, Annex 29**).\n\n**1.1.4 Environmental claims are imprescriptible**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent further emphasizes that in *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* the court also held that, under Article 396(4) of the 2008 Constitution, environmental claims are \"*imprescriptibles*\", that is subject to no statute of limitation, and that the Constitution applies to all environmental claims filed after its entry into force.106 Accordingly, since Ecuador filed its environmental counterclaims in January 2011, i.e. after the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution, Burlington cannot rely on Article 2235 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (the \"Civil Code\" or \"CC\") to argue that claims relating to environmental harm caused prior to January 2007 are prescribed, i.e. time-barred.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 57; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slides 15-16.\n\n86.\n\nBurlington's argument that Ecuador's claims are time-barred with regard to harm resulting from acts prior to January 2007, i.e. four years before Ecuador first filed its counterclaims, is also misplaced. Burlington ignores that Article 2235 of Ecuador's Civil Code exclusively governs fault-based liability. The present environmental claims are for strict liability and are not subject to a statute of limitation according to Article 396(4) of the 2008 Constitution, as acknowledged by the Claimant's expert Professor Bed\u00f3n at the Hearing.107 Even if Article 2235 of the Civil Code were to apply, the time period for prescription (the \"clock\") would only start running upon discovery of the harm, which in this case was after the Consortium abandoned the Blocks in July 2009.108\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 69, referring to: Tr. (Day 2) (ESP), 591:22-592:5 (Cross, Bed\u00f3n), corresponding to Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 570:6-10 (Cross, Bed\u00f3n).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 72.\n\n87.\n\nThis understanding of Ecuadorian law is reinforced by Burlington's policy of concealing and failing to report environmental harm,109 which incidentally also does away with Burlington's \"utterly misplaced\" argument that environmental impact studies approved by Ecuador would somehow allow Burlington to evade liability.110\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 765-815.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 746-764.\n\n88.\n\nIn any event, by acquiring its interest in the Blocks and contractually assuming the environmental liabilities of prior operators, Burlington waived its right to invoke any statute of limitations.111\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 71, 636-672.\n\n89.\n\nIn the alternative, so argues Ecuador, Burlington has not denied that norms of public order may be applied with retroactive effect, as was held in *Baquerizo*.112 The Claimant's expert Professor Bed\u00f3n acknowledged at the Hearing that Article 14(2) of the 2008 Constitution characterizes the constitutional environmental protection regime as a matter of public order.113 Incidentally, the same approach has been adopted in various other jurisdictions.114\n\n*A Baquerizo G.C.

For instance, Norway's Pollution Control Act provides that it \"applies to activities which were initiated before the Act entered into force\" (**Exh. El-189**).\n\n90.\n\nBe that as it may, for the Respondent, even if the 2008 Constitution had no retroactive effect, the result would be the same. Read in conjunction with the *Delfina Torres* decision, the environmental regime set out in the 1998 Constitution also imposes strict liability (*responsibilidad objectiva*) for environmental torts.115 As explained by the Respondent's expert Professor Andrade at the Hearing, the only differences between the 1998 and the 2008 regimes concern the burden of proof and the statute of limitations.116 Similarly, the court in *Aguinda v. Chevron* confirmed the objective nature of the liability, holding that \"[l]iability for environmental harm is always strict, regardless of whether a legal provision exists that establishes so\".117\n\nComit\u00e9 Pro Mejoras Barrio Delfina Torres vda. de Concha v.

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Andrade spoke of the burden of proof in his testimony (\"*carga de la prueba*\"), which was erroneously translated as \"the quality of the evidence\". See: Tr.

EL-233**).\n\n**1.1.5 Burlington bears the burden to prove the inexistence of harm**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nAs regards the burden of proof, Ecuador notes that Burlington \"conveniently remained silent\" on Article 397(1) of the 2008 Constitution, which places the burden of proving the inexistence of potential or real environmental damage on the operator. Its expert Professor Andrade explained that Ecuador must only establish the existence of a \"negative impact\", that is an \"alteration of the natural environment\" (something far less than \"harm\") for the burden of proof to shift to Burlington:118\n\n\"[W]hat the Constitution did in relation to these two components \u2013 harm on the one hand and quantum on the other, the quantum of environmental harm \u2013 what it did it was transfer the burden of proof to the person carrying out the activity or the defendant. So, the only modification of the 2008 Constitution in connection with this matter is that what must be shown, the evidence that must be given by the Claimant, is the negative impact, obviously the impact, negative impact upon nature. This is as far as he has to go\".119\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 64.\n\nTr. (Day 2) (ENG), 420:13-421:1 (Direct, Andrade).\n\n92.\n\nMore specifically, Ecuador argues that it only needs to establish that the Blocks have been \"adversely impacted\", upon which the burden shifts to Burlington to show that this negative impact is \"not significant within the meaning of the *Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*\".120 It is sufficient for it to establish that Burlington performed environmentally risky activities in a certain area and that an adverse environmental impact of the kind that may be caused by such activities is present in that area.121 Finally, Professor Andrade confirmed without being contradicted, that pursuant to Article 2217 of the Civil Code, even if the harm to the Blocks were caused by several persons, including prior operators, Burlington remains jointly liable with all third parties for all such harm.122\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 612. This is further reinforced by (1) the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Constitution.

P-12**).\n\n*Id*., Article 397(1).\n\nConstituent Assembly of Ecuador, Final Report of Working Group 5 on Natural Resources and Biodiversity, 2008, p. 15 (**Crespo ER, Annex 9**). See also: Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 45.\n\n*Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador,* p. 48, \u00b6 20 (**Exh. EL-160**) : \"However, since the burden of proof of such fault is almost impossible or very difficult to be borne by the victim, shifting the burden of proof was considered necessary, in the sense that, he who uses the risky thing and takes advantage of it must show that the harmful act was caused either by force majeure or act of God, or the fault of a third party or the exclusive fault of the victim itself\" (Translation by the Tribunal). See also: Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 48.\n\n*Aguinda v. Chevron,* p. 217 (**Exh. EL-233**). See also: Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 47.\n\n95.\n\nOnce the existence of harm in the area of oil operations is proven, the oil operator is liable, unless it can show that the harm results from *force majeure,* the actions or omissions of the victim, or a third party. As Professor Crespo explained, the rationale for such a regime is that in most instances it is very difficult or impossible to establish that the operator's fault caused the environmental damage.132\n\nCrespo ER, \u00b6\u00b6 33-35; 2nd SMCC, \u00b6 26.\n\n96.\n\nEcuador concludes that, in the present case, there is environmental harm in Blocks 7 and 21. Since the Consortium has not demonstrated that the damage is due to *force majeure,* a third party, or the victim, the Consortium is strictly liable for the harm and must fully restore the ecosystems or pay damages to allow the State to proceed with such restoration.133\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, 42, 50-52. See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 609.\n\n97.\n\nFurthermore, Ecuador argues that, contrary to Burlington's assertion, the presumption of causation applies not only to entities operating simultaneously in the Blocks but also to successive operators. Article 2217 of the Civil Code reinforces this view by providing for joint liability \"where a single harm has been caused by several tortfeasors\".134 Joint liability in environmental law precisely addresses the issue of contamination resulting from years of environmentally risky operations. In any event, according to the Respondent, Burlington failed to establish that Petroamazonas caused any harm in Blocks 7 and 21.135\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 624-625.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 628-633.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, Ecuador argues that it has proven that Blocks 7 and 21 have suffered widespread environmental harm and must be fully restored to background values, or, in the alternative, to the sensitive ecosystem standard set out in *Reglamento Ambiental para las Operaciones Hidrocarbur\u00edferas en el Ecuador* (\"RAOHE\"). It also emphasizes that that Burlington must bear the full costs of restoration.\n\n**1.1.7 Burlington must fully restore the damaged environment to background values or, in the alternative, to the sensitive ecosystems standard**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Environmental harm is distinct from violations of regulatory permissible limits**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIn reliance on the 2008 Constitution, Ecuador argues that Burlington is under an obligation to repair the harm \"found in the Blocks\" and to restore the environment to its original condition (*restitutio in pristinum*).136 Ecuador also points to Burlington's identical obligation in Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC and Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 PSC.137\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Slide 25. Also referring to: Pe\u00f1a Chac\u00f3n, *Responsabilidad y Reparaci\u00f3n Ambiental,* Commission on Environmental Law, Online Papers IUCN, p. 73 (**Crespo ER, Annex 8**).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 81.

Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 26.\n\n100.\n\nAs Ecuador's expert Professor Crespo explains, the notion of \"environmental harm\" under the Constitution was intentionally left undefined in order to cover as many types of environmental harm as possible. The notion includes the loss of biodiversity as well as impacts on air quality, health of local populations, cultural heritage, and the local economy.138\n\nCrespo ER, \u00b6 8, item 7 and \u00b6 76; SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 29-38. Professor Crespo indicated that the notion of \"environmental damages\" covered damage to nature and damage to assets of individuals, as well as various types of environmental threats such as: impact on bodies of water, loss of vegetation, loss of air quality, loss of environmental quality due to increased noise levels, loss of wildlife, impacts on the health of local population, impact on local economies, socioenvironmental conflicts, and tangible and intangible impact on cultural heritage. Crespo ER, \u00b6 76.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Burlington's reliance on the regulatory permissible limits is misplaced. As Ecuador puts it, \"[b]elow the numerical permissible limits, pollution is not simply dirt that can be swept under the carpet\".139 While a harmful activity may be conducted lawfully, it still gives rise to an obligation to repair where harm occurs. The Claimant confuses fault and harm, which are independent from each other.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 82.\n\n102.\n\nIn reliance on decisions of the Colombian Constitutional Court and on scholarly writings, specifically Betancor Rodr\u00edguez and Pe\u00f1a Chac\u00f3n, Ecuador submits that RAOHE and the *Texto Unificado de Legislaci\u00f3n Ambiental Secundaria* (\"TULAS\") do not define compensable environmental harm. That definition is found in the Environmental Management Law of Ecuador (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*) (\"EML\"). The EML defines environmental harm as \"all loss, reduction, detriment or significant damage to the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewal of its resources\".140\n\nEcuador's translation taken from: Reply, \u00b6 239. The original Spanish version is in the Glossary of the Environmental Management Law (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*), Codification 19, published in Supplemental Official Register N\u00b0 418 of 10 September 2004 (**Exh. CA-CC-33**).\n\n103.\n\nTherefore, under the EML, \"the significance of the harm depends exclusively on the magnitude of the impact on the environment\", whereas RAOHE and TULAS make environmental harm dependent on the economic use of the land affected.141 In other words, the significant harm standard under the EML \"is perfectly operational, without the need for numerical standards\",142 which is reinforced by the fact that the EML makes no reference to limits.143 In addition, asserts the Respondent, Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution mandates that *all* environmental damage is to be fully repaired, and Article 397 similarly mentions *full* restoration. In any event, TULAS also requires that contaminated soils be restored to their \"prior condition\".144 This \"prior condition\" is represented by the background values established by IEMS.\n\nReply, \u00b6 241.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 242. Ecuador further points to the EU Directive on Environmental Liability and various legislation in Latin American countries, which employ three criteria to define significant environmental harm: (1) environmental impact affecting human health; (2) environmental harm constituting a permanent alteration of the environment; and (3) environmental impact more significant than naturally-occurring negative fluctuations.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 111.\n\nReply, \u00b6 246, referring to: TULAS, Volume VI, Annex 2, Article 4.1 (**Exh. EL-173**).\n\n**b. Burlington must remediate contaminated soils back to background values**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nWhat Ecuador refers to as its \"main case\" is its claim that full restoration under Article 396(2) in conjunction with Article 71 of the 2008 Constitution requires remediation of all environmental harm to the level of the so-called background values, i.e. restoration of the environment to a condition equivalment to its condition prior to the initiation of oil operations. In Ecuador's submission, any \"alteration to the natural state\"145 qualifies as contamination or harm and must be fully remedied back to so-called background values. There is no \"right to freely pollute up to the permissible limits\".146\n\nSMCC, \u00b6 157.\n\nReply, \u00b6 233.\n\n105.\n\nThis approach is consistent with case law of the highest court in Ecuador147 and was endorsed by Professor Andrade's oral evidence.148 From a scientific point of view, IEMS also testified that the regulatory criteria are insufficient to fully protect the environment or the health of the population. In IEMS's opinion, there is contamination whenever a contaminant exceeds the background values triggering the duty of the operator to \"remediate the affected area so as to return it to its natural state\".149\n\n*Aguinda v. Chevron,* p. 141 (**Exh. EL-233**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 234; R-PHB, \u00b6 88; Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 480:15-22 (Cross, Andrade).\n\nSMCC, \u00b6 156; IEMS ER2, pp. 12-13.\n\n106.\n\nEcuador argues six grounds for its background values case. First, the Parties' experts agree that the 2008 Constitution requires full restoration. Since the permissible limits set forth in RAOHE and in TULAS do not represent full restoration, the Tribunal should disregard them and apply the background values established by IEMS.\n\n107.\n\nSecond, as stated above, RAOHE and TULAS do not define compensable environmental harm. They merely set limits within which hazardous activities may be lawfully conducted in a manner so as to prevent to the extent possible the occurrence of harm.150\n\nReply, \u00b6 235.\n\n108.\n\nThird, the Hearing confirmed that RAOHE and TULAS do not purport to define environmental harm, but that their purpose is to regulate the *activities* of operators.151 The \"hollow theory of tolerable and intolerable impact\" put forward by the Claimant's expert Professor Bed\u00f3n was put to rest when, confronted with Professor Pe\u00f1a Chac\u00f3n's comprehensive quote, he had to admit that the strict liability regime excluded a requirement of fault. For Ecuador, \"[i]f the fault element disappears with strict liability, then infringing regulations such as those contained in RAOHE and TULAS regulations becomes irrelevant to assessing the existence and extent of environmental harm\".152\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 114.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 124.\n\n109.\n\nFourth, RAOHE and TULAS are merely risk management tools. They seek to prevent environmental harm and therefore apply *ex ante*.153 Compliance with administrative regulations is no shield against environmental harm. For instance, harm can occur as a result of the \"cumulative effect of certain emissions [\u2026] where no permissible limits have been infringed\".154\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 125-136.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 135.\n\n110.\n\nFifth, as Professor Crespo confirmed, RAOHE and TULAS govern administrative liability, not civil liability for environmental harm. While the administrative liability regime aims at preventing the occurrence of environmental harm, the civil liability regime provides for full restoration.155\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 137-140.\n\n111.\n\nSixth and last, environmental harm cannot be determined in the abstract by \u2018blindly' applying the permissible limits provided in RAOHE and TULAS. It must be assessed on the facts specific to each case.156 Referring to Professor Andrade's evidence, Ecuador submits that the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS are irrelevant \"because any harm must be assessed on site \"157 and because \"*ex ante* empirical data cannot determine, in advance, whether the renewability of a specific ecosystem has been impaired, let alone significantly impaired\".158 More importantly, RAOHE and TULAS do not distinguish between \"types and characteristics of lands (deserts, forest, rainforest, mountains, islands\u2026)\", making them unsuitable for the sensitive ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest.159 Finally, while the limits set in RAOHE and TULAS are bound to vary over time, thus making them unreliable, the notion of environmental harm in the EML will not change over time.160\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 141.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 143 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 145.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 146.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 148.\n\n112.\n\nIn sum, it is Ecuador's submission that remediation to background values is no extraordinary requirement. Comparative law corroborates this approach.161 Burlington's argument that it has the right to pollute up to the permissible limits is incompatible with \"two of the most fundamental principles of environmental law\".162 The first is the polluter-pays principle according to which operators must internalize the environmental costs of their economic activities, as enshrined in the 2008 Constitution, general tort law, and the Rio Declaration. The second fundamental principle is that nature itself is a bearer of rights entitled to protection and reparation in the event of environmental harm under Article 71 of the Constitution.163 According to Ecuador, the 2008 Constitution also establishes that, in case of doubt, \"environmental regulations should be interpreted in the sense most favourable to the protection of Nature\" (*in dubio pro natura*).164 Hence, absent proof to the contrary, any damage found must be considered significant and thus compensable.\n\nReply, \u00b6 249, referring to: the EU Directive on Environmental Liability; the Argentine General Environmental Law No. 25675, Article 28; the Honduran General Environmental Law, Decree N\u00b0 104-93, Article 87; the Nicaraguan General Law on Environment and Natural Resources No. 217, Article 145; the Spanish Environmental Liability Law 26/2007, Annex II, 1.1.1; and the Peruvian General Environmental Law No. 28611, Article 147.\n\nReply, \u00b6 250.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 255.\n\n**c. In the alternative, Burlington must remediate contaminated soils back to the sensitive ecosystems standard**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nAlternatively, if the Tribunal were to discard the background values approach and refer to RAOHE and TULAS as the basis for defining environmental harm, it should apply the permissible limits for *sensitive ecosystems* in those laws,165 for the two following reasons. First, the future land use, taken into account under RAOHE to determine the applicable limits, must be taken to refer to the time \"when oil operations will end\", as opposed to the end of a given operator's activities, as was clarified at the Hearing.166 Oil operations are temporary and the oilfields in Blocks 7 and 21 are \"destined to be absorbed again by rainforest\".167 As a result, the sensitive ecosystem standard must apply, which implies restoration to the state of pristine rainforest.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 151-192.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 158; Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2202:3-10 (Closing, Silva Romero).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 163.\n\n114.\n\nSecond, the oilfields were \"carved out\" of the sensitive ecosystems of the Amazonian rainforest, an area of \"significant ecological importance\" vulnerable to change and in need of protection.168 According to Ecuador, Block 7 is situated in a \"fragile and diverse ecosystem\" with numerous rivers and streams, such as the Napo River crossing the entire Block, the Suno River crossing the Oso field, and the Payamino River in the northern part of Block 7.169 Similarly, Block 21 is an ecologically rich but vulnerable area, characterized by rainforest and drained by several rivers, of which the most important is the Napo River.170 Burlington's argument that Blocks 7 and 21 do not qualify as sensitive ecosystems under RAOHE and TULAS, because they are not so-called \"designated protected areas\" under Ecuadorian law, is ill-founded. According to Ecuador, by devising a distinction in RAOHE between industrial use, agricultural use and sensitive ecosystem, \"the Ecuadorian legislator obviously intended for the Amazonian rainforest, which does not fulfill any industrial or agricultural use, to be included in the latter category\".171\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 192.\n\nSMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59; 2nd SMCC, \u00b6 58. Ecuador points to the description of Block 7 as a fragile and diverse ecosystem by one of the prior private operators in that Block, Oryx Ecuador Energy Company (\"Oryx\"): \"[\u2026] given that Oryx's operations take place in the fragile and diverse amazonic ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem that dominates the course of the Napo river and its tributaries, it is also justified that those operations be performed adopting all possible technical and economical, preventive and corrective measures to reduce to the minimum possible the undesirable environmental effects, thereby complying with its environmental obligations foreseen in the Hydrocarbons Law, the Exploration and Exploitation Agreement, the Rules of Hydrocarbons Operations in Ecuador and its own environmental policy\".

Ecuador has not established any of these elements.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 189; C-PHB, \u00b6 91.\n\n119.\n\nIn support of its defense, Burlington contends that (i) the Consortium was a responsible operator; (ii) Ecuador misstates the applicable legal standards; (iii) it uses the wrong definition of harm; (iv) it erroneously relies on background values; (v) it applies the wrong standards when it alternatively refers to regulatory criteria; (vi) it does not prove causation; and (vii) it raises a claim that is time-barred.\n\n**1.2.1 The Consortium was a responsible and environmentally conscientious operator**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nEcuador's attempt to depict the Consortium as a careless operator is contradicted by Ecuador's own data. Indeed, there were no material oil spills during the Consortium's operations and there are only limited pockets of regulatory exceedances in the Blocks.181 In reality, the Consortium \"was a responsible operator and good corporate citizen that prioritized environmental conditions, complied with government regulations, promptly reported and remediated spills and invested in the neighboring communities\".182 In particular, the environmental audits attested to the Consortium's \"overall regulatory compliance and sound stewardship of the Blocks\".183 In any event, Burlington asserts that there can be no liability so long as the Consortium acted as a *bonus pater familias* or a reasonably prudent operator.184\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 93.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 17, 280.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 121.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 500.\n\n121.\n\nAs a responsible member of the Consortium, Burlington is willing to accept responsibility for exceedances above regulatory criteria for two sites \"at which it cannot definitively link harm to non-Consortium activities (Yuralpa Pad A and Jaguar 1 Area 3T)\" and to bear the costs to close four open pits and abandon seven wells.185\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n**1.2.2 Ecuador misstates the applicable legal standards**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nFirst, fault-based and not strict liability governs Ecuador's environmental claim. Ecuadorian law imposed strict liability in October 2008. Under Article 7 of the Civil Code, \"the law provides only for the future; it has no retroactive effect [...]\" (Translation by the Tribunal). Hence, the strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution does not govern Ecuador's claim in respect of harm that predates the entry into force of the Constitution in October 2008.186 Accordingly, Burlington cannot be held liable unless it is proven that the Consortium breached its duty of care.187 No such proof has been addressed.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 200-203.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 498-504; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 280-318.\n\n123.\n\nBurlington further notes that, as Professor Bed\u00f3n explains, the relevant date to determine the applicable legal regime is the date of the *occurrence* of the act. This date is consistent with the statute of limitation for torts in the Civil Code, which runs from the date on which the harmful act occurred.188 As a result, it rejects Ecuador's argument that strict liability governs because that regime was only in place at the time of IEMS's inspection in 2011. Similarly, it discards Ecuador's view that the Ecuadorian Supreme Court imposed strict liability as early as 2002. Indeed, in *Delfina Torres*, the Supreme Court merely discussed strict liability in *dicta*, and in fact applied fault-based liability with a reversal of the burden of proof.189 In any event, Burlington reiterates that whatever changes were made in 2008, the new Constitution \"cannot have any retroactive effect\",190 since the applicable legal regime is the one in force at the time of the allegedly harmful act.191 Accordingly, the 2008 regime only applies to acts that postdate the Constitution's entry into force.192\n\nArticle 2235 Civil Code (**Exh. CA-CC-38**). See: CMCC, \u00b6 208; Rejoinder, \u00b6 327; Bed\u00f3n ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 205-213, referring to: *Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador* (**Exh. EL-160**) ; Bed\u00f3n ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 190.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 206-210.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 210.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimant identifies a second misstatement of the law argued by Ecuador, relating to the burden of proof. For Burlington, Ecuador has the burden of proving environmental harm.193 Proof of harm is an essential element of tortious liability. Ecuador's position that *any effect* on the environment is an environmental harm and that it only needs to make a showing of a \"negative impact\" defies common sense. An effect on the environment in compliance with environmental regulations cannot constitute recoverable \"harm\". Otherwise, there would be no purpose in regulations and government authorizations.194 Astonishingly, Professor Crespo erroneously believes that Ecuador need only \"allege\" or \"point out the *probability* of harm\".195 If that were true, Ecuador's theory would imply that \"any participant in human activity in Ecuador is presumptively liable for an environmental damage figure chosen by any plaintiff\", since any human activity causes some impact to the environment.196\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 218-221.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 22.\n\n125.\n\nThird, contrary to Ecuador's contention, Ecuadorian law requires causation even for strict liability. The Supreme Court of Ecuador held so and Article 396 of the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution expressly provides that persons are strictly liabile for damages which they have \"caused\". Thus, Ecuador is wrong to argue that it \"need only establish that environmental harm exists\".197 In addition, it must prove that Burlington and Perenco caused such harm.198\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 228, referring to: 2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 28.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 222-229.\n\n**1.2.3 Ecuador's definition of environmental harm is baseless, since a significant impact requires an exceedance of permissible limits**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador's allegation of widespread environmental harm in the Blocks is a \"fantasy\"199 based on novel and unsupported theories about the definition of environmental harm and on flawed reports from its expert IEMS. Among other things, IEMS applied incorrect legal standards, analyzed the soil in mud pits as though it were regular soil, overestimated the volume of contaminated soil through unreliable modelling, and failed to properly filter groundwater samples.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 231.\n\n127.\n\nBurlington notes that it is common ground that the EML defines harm under Ecuadorian law and that the 2008 Constitution left this definition untouched. Ecuador is wrong to deny that the notion of harm is further specified in RAOHE and TULAS, and to make artificial distinctions between the notion of harm and the idea of setting limits to prevent harm. Ecuador's first argument in its Second Supplemental Memorial that its own regulations were \"arbitrary\" is just as erroneous as its second argument that RAOHE and TULAS do not define harm but merely seek to set limits on dangerous activities.200\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 33.\n\n128.\n\nIn conformity with the EML, \"harm\" requires a \"significant negative impact\". As the Respondent's experts Professors Andrade and Crespo acknowledged, this wording implies that some negative impacts are significant, while others are not.201 If all types of negative impacts were prohibited, there could be no development at all.202 While the EML defines \"harm\", it does not set specific permissible limits for each contaminant. Burlington therefore considers it necessary to resort to Ecuador's implementing regulations, specifically RAOHE and TULAS, where the notion of \"harm\" is further specified.203\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 27.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 30.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 34.\n\n129.\n\nBurlington also asserts that reliance on the limits set in RAOHE and TULAS conforms with the \"constitutional right of legal certainty\".204 In other words, \"there must be a clear dividing line determining the point at which environmental impacts become significant \u2013 a dividing line between \u2018insignificant impacts' and \u2018harm'\".205\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 31, referring to: Article 82 of the 2008 Constitution (**Exh. P-12**).\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 31.\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimant further points to Ecuador's practice after 2008, which shows that it refers to permissible limits, not to background values, when it defines \"harm\". For instance, the Ministerial Accord 169 provides that environmental harm must be restored to the conditions \"determined by the environmental authority\", and the Ministerial Resolution No. 1 refers to \"harm\" by reference to permissible limits.206 Ecuadorian case law and the practice of Ecuador's regulatory agencies equally demonstrate that harm is always defined by reference to permissible limits. With respect to case law, Professor Andrade, the Respondent's expert, conceded at the Hearing that no Ecuadorian court had ever applied background values.207 The *Los Vencedores* and the *Municipality of Orellana* decisions support the proposition that there is no harm if there is no exceedance of permissible limits.208 In respect of *Aguinda*, Professor Andrade admitted that the court speaks of \"full reparation\", but does not once make reference to \u2013 let alone apply \u2013 background values.209\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 39-43, referring to: Ministerial Agreement 169, p. 0003 (**Exh.

Burlington highlights that IEMS was instructed by Ecuador to employ background values and never actually analyzed whether the ecosystem was in fact affected.213 IEMS's first expert report actually referred to permissible limits as applicable standard.214 \"Astonishingly \u2013 argues Burlington \u2013 IEMS admitted that if the Consortium were operating today [\u2026], it *would* be subject to RAOHE and TULAS regulations, not \u2018background values'\".215 Thus, had Burlington not been expropriated, it would be subject to the regulatory standards. Having been expropriated, it is somehow subject to background values \"resulting in billions of dollars of bogus damages\".216\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 79, 99, referring to: Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 47:15-20 (Opening, Silva Romero) (\"Ecuador fails to see how in this case it could be disputed that all environmental harm should be repaired so as to restore the site to its original, natural condition, and this is the reason why IEMS, the technical experts of Ecuador, were instructed to employ \u2018background values'\").\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 100, referring to: IEMS ER1, p. 48 (\"In the opinion of IEMS, the regulatory limits of concentration of contaminants in Ecuador must be used to establish the legal obligation of the Consortium for Block 7 and Block 21 to implement the environmental clean-up and/or restoration measures\").\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 79.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 105.\n\n133.\n\nIn support of its argumentation, the Claimant also relies on the purpose of RAOHE, which in the regulation's words, is to set \"[p]ermissible limits for the identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbon industry\".217 Should background values govern, as Ecuador claims, RAOHE would serve no apparent purpose. Further, IEMS itself acknowledged, in its first report and in the *City Oriente v. Ecuador* arbitration, that RAOHE establishes the criteria to define the scope of environmental harm.218 If background values were relevant, then active oil fields would have to be restored to a pristine state of nature even as the oil fields continue to be in operation. This is absurd, especially considering Ecuador's aggressive expansion of oil production.\n\nCMCC \u00b6 109, citing: RAOHE, Table 6 (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 245-248.\n\n134.\n\nIn refutation of Ecuador's reliance on RAOHE Table 6, Burlington remarks that Table 6 states that background values may be used to *increase* permissible limits, not to *decrease* them. Thus, if the natural concentration of a given element in the soil is higher than its regulatory limit, the permissible limit may be increased to that naturally occurring level \u2013 the reverse is not true.219\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 244, 249-254.\n\n135.\n\nBurlington also rebuts Ecuador's further argument according to which background values alone comport with the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution. First, the 2008 Constitution cannot apply retroactively and thus would cover at most a 10-month period (between its coming into force in October 2008 and Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks in July 2009). Second, Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution only comes into play in the event of \"harm\", which is defined in environmental regulations and in particular RAOHE.220\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 255-258.\n\n136.\n\nBurlington further disputes IEMS's assertion that the Ecuadorian regulatory criteria \"might not be enough to protect the health of the local population [...]\".221 On the contrary, says Burlington, \"Ecuador's regulatory limits are remarkably stringent\".222 Ecuador is more protective than other oil producing regions such as Venezuela, Texas and Louisiana. Its regulations are also more stringent than the Risk-Based Corrective Action (\"RBCA\") methodology widely adopted in European countries, the United States, and other parts of the world. In a nutshell, RAOHE criteria are highly protective of human health and no public health rationale warrants the application of a more stringent standard.223\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 260, citing: IEMS ER3, p. 38.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 262.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 240-242, 260-265.\n\n137.\n\nBurlington moreover criticizes IEMS's methodology in calculating the background values that it employs, which resulted in labeling clean samples as contaminated ones. When aggregated across contaminants, Ecuador's background values result in 84% of clean samples being labeled as contaminated.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, according to Burlington, Ecuador's reliance on background values, as opposed to RAOHE criteria, has enormous consequences for its counterclaims. An amount of damages of approximately USD 1.3 billion of Ecuador's claim depends on the application of background values. If the background values are discarded, Ecuador's claims shrink from USD 2.2 billion to USD 895 million.224\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 276.\n\n**1.2.5 IEMS's \"regulatory case\" based on sensitive ecosystems is likewise incorrect**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nBurlington also challenges Ecuador's alternative submission based on regulatory criteria because it exclusively relies on the sensitive ecosystem standard, which is inapposite in most cases. Burlington disagrees with Ecuador's assertion that the entirety of the Blocks is situated in a \"sensitive\" region or that they are located in a biosphere reserve, noting that only a very limited number of areas are designated by Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment as \"sensitive ecosystem\".225\n\nTr. (Day 1) (ENG), 247:10-19 (Opening, Renfroe).\n\n140.\n\nBurlington further argues that, according to RAOHE Table 6, the permissible levels of contamination depend on the \"use\" of the land, which is classified by RAOHE as industrial, agricultural or sensitive ecosystem, the first being the most permissive and the last the least permissive. IEMS's calculation of contamination levels based on the sensitive ecosystem threshold is unwarranted as only a small number of sites in the Blocks intersect with designated \"sensitive ecosystems\" areas.226 Most of the areas where the Consortium's active operations take place are a \"quintessential example\" of land use for industrial purposes, with the surrounding areas being used mostly for agriculture.227\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 278-279; C-PHB, \u00b6 125.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 289.\n\n141.\n\nFor Burlington, Ecuador's argument that the Blocks are to be considered as sensitive ecosystem in their entirety is inconsistent with RAOHE and with Ecuador's own application of RAOHE other than in this arbitration.228 Under RAOHE, the \"posterior use that will be given to the remediated soil\" determines the land use. Posterior use is \"immediate subsequent use to the seizure\", and not use when the oil operations are completed as advocated by Ecuador.229 The areas within the oilfields, such as platforms and drilling equipment, are used to conduct hydrocarbon operations \u2013 an industrial use. This is the sole purpose, present and foreseeable, of these areas. The lands surrounding the oilfields, in turn, are used mostly for pastures, crops, or wood gathering, that is, for agricultural purposes. According to GSI, \"95% of the areas surrounding the inspected platforms constitute agricultural areas or secondary forests\".230\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 283.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 125.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 302.\n\n142.\n\nBurlington also considers that Ecuador's exclusive reliance on the sensitive ecosystem standard is contrary to its own practice. According to Burlington, that practice confirms that most of the land in the Blocks is destined for either \"industrial\" or \"agricultural\" use. On multiple occasions, Ecuador approved, or did not object to, plans where the land in the Blocks was classified as either \"industrial\" or \"agricultural\".231 For instance, IEMS conceded at the Hearing that the ex-post studies on the environmental condition of the Blocks after Ecuador's takeover applied the agricultural use standard.232 In application of RAOHE, the \"posterior use\" of any soil remediated will continue to be either \"industrial\" or \"agricultural\". In short, the \"sensitive ecosystems\" classification bears no relationship to the actual use of the land and must be rejected.233\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 127.\n\n*Ibid*., referring to: Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 761:11-17 (Cross, Alfaro).\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 291-299, 303-310.\n\n143.\n\nIEMS also incorrectly relies on Table 2 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS. For the Claimant, this table only establishes pre-estimated background values for substances not included in RAOHE Table 6 (such as barium and vanadium). It does not express remediation criteria, which are found in Table 3 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS, entitled \"Criteria for Remediation and Restoration of Soils\". TULAS expressly states that the standards for remediation or restoration \"are included in Table 3\",234 a fact that IEMS itself has acknowledged in the *City Oriente* arbitration. Hence, Burlington views TULAS Table 3 as the appropriate table to determine soil remediation standards.235\n\nTULAS Book VI, Annex 2, \u00b6 4.2.2 (**Exh. EL-173**).\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\n144.\n\nAs a final point, Burlington stresses that the land use designations in RAOHE are sufficiently protective of the human health and the environment, since Ecuador's standards are amongst the most stringent worldwide.236\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 133-135.\n\n145.\n\nAs noted above, for Burlington, applying the proper regulatory criteria has an enormous impact on Ecuador's damages claim. In particular, GSI found that 74% of the soil samples analyzed by IEMS that show exceedances of the \"sensitive ecosystems\" limits are in reality compliant with Ecuadorian regulations for industrial and agricultural land.237 Applying correct regulatory criteria, Ecuador's alleged damages are further reduced by USD 885 million to a total of approximately USD 10 million, for which Burlington accepts liability in the amount of USD 1.09 million.238\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 311 and graph.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 17, 282.\n\n**1.2.6 Ecuador entirely ignores its duty to prove causation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nBurlington opposes Ecuador's view that Ecuadorian law imposes a rebuttable presumption of causation. For Burlington, the 2008 Constitution imposes the burden to prove causation on Ecuador and Burlington is only liable for harm caused during its tenure of the Blocks, not for the one caused by Ecuador itself or prior operators.\n\n**a. Ecuador bears the burden to prove causation**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nBurlington's submission is that causation is not presumed, and that Ecuador must prove causation. Professor Bed\u00f3n gave clear evidence to this effect at the Hearing and even Professor Crespo acknowledged that environmental harm must \"be caused by the operator's activity\".239 Ecuadorian courts consistently require plaintiffs to prove causation, including in strict liability cases.240 For instance, in *Medardo Luna*, the Ecuadorian Supreme Court held that the injured party must prove (i) the fact, (ii) the damage, and (iii) the causal nexus. The same conclusion was reached by the re-named National Court of Justice in *Aguinda*, where it held that in the post-2008 strict liability regime the plaintiff must only \"corroborate the risky activity and the relation of *causality*\".241\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 223, referring to: Crespo ER, \u00b6 79.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 224 (\"Ecuadorian courts have explicitly confirmed that causation is a critical element of strict liability as well as of fault-based liability\").\n\nEmphasis by Burlington. C-PHB, \u00b6 61, citing: *Aguinda v. Chevron,* p. 239 (**Exh. EL-233**).\n\n**b. Burlington is only liable for harm caused during its tenure of the Blocks**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that it is only liable for damage caused while the Consortium operated the Blocks. Causation must be proven because each operator is responsible for the damage which it has caused, not for harm caused by someone else.242 Since Professor Crespo testified that Ecuador must prove that the damage was caused \"during the time of the Consortium's operations\", it follows that Petroamazonas, who is presently operating the Blocks, is presumptively liable for any harm that occurred after July 2009. In this context, Professor Andrade's explanations that Petroamazonas somehow plays by different rules must be rejected.243\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 62.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 64, referring to: Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 442:14-443:4 (Direct, Andrade).\n\n149.\n\nConsequently, Burlington also disputes that it is jointly liable for harm caused by prior operators.244 Joint and several liability can only result from \"the *same* tort or wrongful act, not *successive* ones\".245 Hence, Burlington is only liable for the conduct of Perenco, as operator for the Consortium, and not for the conduct of previous or subsequent operators.246\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 269-275.\n\nEmphasis by Burlington. C-PHB, \u00b6 66; Reply, \u00b6 272.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 66.\n\n**c. Contamination in Coca-Payamino was caused by Ecuador itself**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nBurlington submits that the environmental harm in Coca-Payamino, which constitutes more than half of Ecuador's claim, was \"almost certainly\" caused by CEPE and Petroproducci\u00f3n when they operated the fields in the 1980s and during the latter's alternate operatorship with Oryx of the CPUF in the 1990s.247\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 441. Petroproducci\u00f3n assumed operations of the CPUF, from April 1991 through February 1994, and from June 1997 through March 2000. Oryx operated the field from February 1994 through June 1997. The CPUF was continuously operated by the Block 7 Contractor after March 2000. *Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n151.\n\nIndeed, there is abundant evidence of oil spills, problems with mud pits, lack of remediation, and continuous discharges into the environment during CEPE and Petroproducci\u00f3n's tenures of the Blocks. For instance, an environmental audit in 1999 found Petroproducci\u00f3n's operating practices to be \"reactive and not proactive\".248 Furthermore, Burlington notes that, notwithstanding the express order of the Tribunal, Ecuador failed to produce any spill report or remediation program from that period.249 In support of its allegations, Burlington cites the following facts: (i) in Coca CPF, Petroproducci\u00f3n \"permanently discharged production water\" into the environment prior to 1994;250 (ii) in Payamino 2 and 8, the crude oil and heavy metals found in the Jungal swamp originate from a pre-1992 rupture of the mud and production test pits built by CEPE in 1987;251 (iii) in Coca 6, a serious spill was recorded by Oryx in 1999 and the pit in the northern part of the platform was built by Petroproducci\u00f3n in 1989, while the 2007 spill was fully remediated;252 (iv) in Payamino 4, CEPE built pits in 1988 without using liners and filled them with oil-based drilling muds;253 and (v) in Coca 4, drilling was undertaken by CEPE in 1989 which explains the presence of barium in that area.254\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 443, referring to: Patrick Grizzle, *Environmental Audit of Petroproducci\u00f3n Operations of the Coca-Payamino Field,* January 1999 (**Exh.

Ecuador fails to account for environmental harm caused by Petroamazonas after July 2009**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nBurlington calls attention to the fact that Ecuador's claim ignores that the latter took over the Blocks in July 2009 and aggressively expanded operations. In this context, Ecuador's insistence on the sensitive ecosystem standard is \"absurd\" when one considers that Ecuador itself has actively increased the industrial use of the Blocks.255 According to Burlington, Ecuador's expansion of the fields has obviated the need for any remediation, as is shown by three illustrations.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 469.\n\n153.\n\nFirst, the Coca 13 site has been expanded by over 40,000 square meters, 11 new wells, four new mud pits and a new CPF. Doing so, Ecuador has subsumed and \"wiped out\" the alleged zone of contamination for which it claims that Burlington is liable. Yet, it claims USD 26.5 million in damages under its background values case and USD 7.4 million under its sensitive ecosystem case for this site.256\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 474.\n\n154.\n\nSecond, Oso A has also been dramatically expanded, with Ecuador drilling 14 new wells. As with Coca 13, \"Petroamazonas's extensive development of Oso A since July 2009 has obviated the need for any remediation and rendered IEMS's conclusions obsolete \u2013 if contamination even existed in the first place\".257\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 481.\n\n155.\n\nThird, Burlington argues that Ecuador failed to mention or account for the occurrence of a spill in Mono CPF that occurred in 2010 or 2011. In this context, Burlington highlights that IEMS's first report identified this spill as a recognized environmental condition (\"REC\"), but \"curiously\" did not include it in its third report \"despite the fact that Mono CPF represents one of the single largest claims by dollar amount in all of Ecuador's counterclaims\".258 Therefore, Ecuador's claims for over USD 100 million must fail because it cannot show that the alleged contamination is attributable to the Consortium.259\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 486.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 486.\n\n**e. The PSCs exonerate the Consortium for harm caused by others**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nBurlington notes that Ecuador relies on the PSCs to absolve it from having to prove causation, the Consortium being allegedly liable for environmental harm caused by prior operators. Not only is Ecuador's reference to the PSCs barred by the tortious nature of its counterclaim, it is also wrong in and of itself. Indeed, the PSCs \"expressly exonerate the Consortium from responsibility for harm caused by others\".260\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 67. Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provides that \"[t]he Contractor shall not be liable for environmental conditions preexisting at the beginning of operations under the Services Contract\" (**Exh. CE-CC-28**) ; while Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 Participation Contract stipulates that \"[t]he Contractor shall not be responsible for pre-existing environmental conditions at the start of the operations under the Contract\" (**Exh. CE-Cc-13**).\n\n157.\n\nIn this context, Burlington further observes that the limited exceedances above regulatory criteria found at 17 sites were not caused by the Consortium, but by prior operators, including State-owned operators. For instance, there is ample proof that the contamination of the Jungal swamp in Payamino 2 and 8 was caused by CEPE between 1988 and 1992. In fact, Burlington produced evidence linking the contamination found at all but two of the 17 sites to the activities of parties other than the Consortium. As a responsible member of the Consortium, Burlington is \"willing to accept liability for the two sites at which it cannot definitely link harm to non-Consortium activities\" for a total cost of USD 1.09 million.261\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n**1.2.7 Ecuador's claims are time-barred under Ecuadorian law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nBurlington's last defense is that the counterclaim is time-barred. Article 2235 of the Civil Code enshrines a four-year limitation period. Ecuador's reliance on the so-called \u2018discovery rule', which it borrows from other jurisdictions, is ill-founded. Indeed, Ecuador fails to cite a single case in support of this rule. Even if such a discovery rule were to exist, the period would start to run only when Ecuador knew or should have known (\"constructive knowledge\") about the alleged environmental harm.262 In light of the fact that the Consortium was strictly supervised by Ecuadorian regulatory authorities, that Ecuador consistently approved the Consortium's environmental impact studies, that the Consortium regularly filed reports and audits, and that regular inspections were carried out, Ecuador must be deemed to have had constructive knowledge of any alleged harm throughout the Consortium's operations.263 Thus, even if Ecuador had legitimate claims, they are now time-barred under Article 2235 of the Civil Code.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 74.\n\n**2. Applicable legal framework**\n---------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nSince the 1970s, Ecuador has incorporated environmental norms into its legal order, including with respect to hydrocarbons activities, at the constitutional, legislative and regulatory levels, as discussed below.264 After setting out the relevant provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law (2.1), the Tribunal will review the evolution of Ecuador's environmental framework for oilfield operations, including the Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination (2.2), the 1978 and 1998 Constitutions (2.3), the Law on Environmental Management (2.4), the Substitute Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations in Ecuador (2.5), the Unified Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation (2.6), and the 2008 Constitution (2.7). Finally, it will set out relevant provisions of the PSCs (2.8).\n\nSMCC, \u00b6 7; CMCC, \u00b6 107. See also: Chronology of Ecuador's Environmental Laws and Regulations, 1971-2008 (**Exh.

See also: Bed\u00f3n ER1, App. B 0008.\n\n162.\n\nAs regards water, for instance, Article 16 prohibited the dumping of waste water containing contaminants harmful to human health, fauna or property \"into the sewage network, or into streams, irrigation channels, rivers, natural or artificial lakes, or in the ocean, or to let it infiltrate onto land\".273 In connection with soils, Article 20 prohibited the discharge of \"any type of contaminants that could alter the quality of the soil and affect human health, flora, fauna, natural resources and other goods\" without complying with applicable technical and regulatory standards.274\n\nLaw on Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination, Article 16 (**Exh.

The right to live in an environment free of contamination. The State has a duty to ensure that this right is not curtailed, as well as to safeguard nature preservation. The law shall establish the restrictions to the exercise of certain rights or liberties so as to protect the environment\" (Translation by the Tribunal). Article 50 further provided for police powers allowing municipalities to render environmental protection effective: \"In furtherance of the right to housing and the conservation of the environment, municipalities may expropriate, reserve and control areas for future development pursuant to law\". It is to be noted that in 1985, the Ministry of Energy and Mines published a Guide for the Preparation of Environmental Impact Studies (*Instructivo para la Preparaci\u00f3n de Informes y Estudios de Impacto Ambiental*), Ministerial Accord No. 764 of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, published in Official Register No. 330 of 9 December 1985 (**Exh.

CA-CC-33**).\n\n*Id*., Article 1.\n\n166.\n\nWith respect to the instruments of environmental management, the EML provided for the assessment of environmental impacts and environmental controls. For instance, Article 21 EML provides that licenses for economic activities may only be granted if environmental management systems are drawn up, which must include \"base line studies; an environmental impact assessment; risk assessment; management plans; risk management plans; monitoring systems; contingency and mitigation plans; environmental hearings and plans for withdrawal\".282 The EML also defines many relevant terms, such as contamination, environmental harm, and environmental impact.283\n\n*Id*., Article 21.\n\n*Id*., Glossary of definitions. Contamination (\"*contaminaci\u00f3n*\") is defined as follows: \"It is the presence in the environment of substances, elements, energy, or a combination thereof, the concentration and permanence of which are higher or lower than those prescribed by the laws in force\". Environmental harm (\"*da\u00f1o ambiental*\") is defined as follows: \"It is any significant loss, decrease, detriment or impairment to the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources\". Environmental impact (\"*impacto ambiental*\") is defined as follows: \"It is the positive or negative alteration of the environment, caused directly or otherwise by a project or activity in a given area\" (Translations by the Tribunal).\n\n**2.5 The Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations in Ecuador (RAOHE)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nIn 1992, Ecuador enacted RAOHE,284 which was amended in 1995285 and replaced in 2001 by an expanded and updated version.286 RAOHE contains various chapters and annexes that apply to all phases of oilfield operations in Ecuador,287 including prospection, exploration, exploitation, industrialization, storage and transportation, and commercialization of crude oil, its derivatives, and natural gas susceptible of causing environmental impacts.\n\nEnvironmental Regulation for Hydrocarbons Activities in Ecuador, Accord No. 621 of the Minister of Energy and Mines dated 21 February 1992, published in Official Register No. 888 of 6 March 1992 (**Exh.

EL-174**).\n\n168.\n\nRAOHE requires operators to submit environmental programs and audits to the relevant Ministry on a regular basis,288 to undertake regular internal monitoring of environmental conditions in relation to atmospheric emissions, solid and liquid discharges, as well as remediation of contaminated soils or pits.289 It also requires operators to present environmental impact studies prior to any new phase in oilfield operations,290 including by providing environmental management and monitoring plans to mitigate and control adverse impacts.291\n\nSee, for instance: *Id*., Article 10.\n\nSee, for instance: *Id*., Article 12.\n\nSee, for instance: *Id*., Articles 13, 33-41.\n\n*Id*., Article 41, paragraphs 7-8.\n\n169.\n\nArticle 42 of RAOHE further provides that operators must conduct biennial environmental audits,292 in order to determine whether their oilfield operations comply with applicable environmental standards, including the management and monitoring plans.293 Article 42 reads as follows:\n\n*ART. 42.\u2013 Environmental audit.\u2013 The Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, through the National Environmental Protection Directorate, shall audit, at least every two years, or whenever the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection so orders upon detecting non-compliance with the Environmental Management Plan, the environmental aspects of the various hydrocarbons activities conducted by the ones subjected to control.*\n\n*The Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, through the National Environmental Protection Directorate (DINAPA), shall determine the type and scope of the Environmental Audit for the operations of those subjected to control based on compliance with the Environmental Management Plan.*\n\n*At least every two years, those subjected to control shall conduct an Environmental Audit of their activities, following approval of the corresponding Terms of Reference by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, and they shall submit the respective audit report to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection.*\n\n*Additionally, the parties, upon the termination of hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation, or in the event of a change of operator, shall conduct the audit referenced in Art. 11 of the Regulation to Law 44, amending the Hydrocarbons Law.*\n\n*To the effect of the aforementioned audits, the ones subjected to control shall select an environmental auditor qualified by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection to carry out the monitoring and verification of compliance with the Environmental Management Plan, in accordance with the Terms of Reference previously approved by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, in which the documentary framework is determined against which the audit shall be conducted* (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n*Id*., Article 42.\n\n*Id*., Article 43(b).\n\n170.\n\nArticle 16 of RAOHE stipulates that the operator must present for approval to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection (*Subsecretar\u00eda de Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental*) a remediation plan in cases of remediation of pits, contaminated soils, and \"major accidents with spills of more than five barrels of oil, combustibles or other product\".294 Within 15 days after completion of the remediation works, the operator must submit a technical evaluation report to the Undersecretariat for Environmental Protection through the National Direction of Environmental Protection (*Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Protecci\u00f3n* *Ambiental*).295\n\n*Id*., Article 16(2). The Parties disagree on the scope of the obligation of notification. Ecuador submitted that the Consortium was under a duty to report any spill, not just those exceeding five barrels of crude oil. According to Ecuador, the Consortium in any event failed to report all spills that exceeded the five barrel limit. For its part, Burlington argued that it reported all spills exceeding five barrels of crude oil, in addition to other, more minor spills. See, for instance: Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 44-52; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 766-774; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 290-298; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7.\n\nRAOHE, Article 16(4) (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n171.\n\nRAOHE also requires that operators comply with permissible limits, i.e. with maximum benchmark values set out in the annexes. Thus, with respect to atmospheric emissions, liquid discharges and solid wastes, Article 86 of RAOHE requires that operators comply with the permissible limits set out in Annexes Nos. 1, 2 and 3, which constitute the \"minimum program for the internal environmental monitoring\" of the operator.296 If a permissible limit set in the annexes is exceeded, the operator must immediately notify the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection and explain what corrective measures have been applied.297\n\n*Id*., Article 86(1).\n\n*Id*., Article 86(2).\n\n172.\n\nAnnex 2 contains six tables detailing \"parameters, maximum benchmark values and permissible limits\" for routine environmental monitoring and control relating to atmospheric emissions (Table 3), liquid water and effluent discharges (Table 4), black and grey water discharges (Table 5), soil remediation (Table 6), mud pit leachates (Table 7), and waste disposal (Table 8). Finally, Annex 3 contains additional parameters, benchmarks and limits for more in-depth environmental monitoring and control.298\n\n*Id*., Article 86(a)-(c).\n\n173.\n\nRAOHE Table 4 establishes permissible limits for the permanent environmental monitoring of water and effluent discharges during all phases of hydrocarbons operations. It requires oilfield operators to routinely monitor discharges in accordance with the limits for discharge points (Table 4a) and for points at the receptor bodies (Table 4b).299\n\n*Id*., pp. 55-56, Annex 2, Table 4.\n\n174.\n\nRAOHE Table 6 sets out permissible limits for the identification and remediation of contaminated soils \"in all phases of the hydrocarbons industry\".300 It specifies that \"the permissible limits to be applied to a determined project depend on the subsequent use (*uso posterior*) to be given to the remediated soil\".301 As already mentioned, Table 6 distinguishes between three types of land use: industrial, agricultural and sensitive ecosystems.302 Industrial land use criteria apply to \"sites of industrial use (constructions, etc.)\"; agricultural land use criteria focus on the \"protection of soils and crops\"; and sensitive ecosystem land use criteria are employed for the \"protection of sensitive ecosystems such as the National Heritage of Natural Areas and others identified in the corresponding environmental study\".303\n\n*Id*., p. 57, Annex 2, Table 6 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n*Ibid.* (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.*, notes 2-4 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n175.\n\nThe permissible limits set in RAOHE Table 6, Annex 2 are the following:304\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **RAOHE Table 6, Annex 2** |\n| **Parameter** | **Expressed** **in** | **Unit** | **Agricultural** **Use** | **Industrial** **Use** | **Sensitive** **Ecosystems** |\n| Total hydrocarbons | TPH | mg/kg | <2500 | <4000 | <1000 |\n| Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) | C | mg/kg | <2 | <5 | <1 |\n| Cadmium | Cd | mg/kg | <2 | <10 | <1 |\n| Nickel | Ni | mg/kg | <50 | <100 | <40 |\n| Lead | Pb | mg/kg | <100 | <500 | <80 |\n\n*Id*., p. 57, Annex 2, Table 6 (Translation by the Tribunal, footnotes omitted).\n\n176.\n\nTable 6 also contemplates the possibility of increasing the maximum allowable limits where uncontaminated soils show natural concentrations, in other words background values, above the limits of Table 6. In such a case, RAOHE stipulates that these background values must prevail.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to Table 6, contaminated soils must be monitored at least every six months with at least one sample and a final characterization once remediation works are finalized.\n\n178.\n\nRAOHE Table 7 spells out the permissible limits for leachates during the \"final disposal at surface-level of mud drillings and cuttings\".305 The limits vary depending on whether a pit is lined or not (has an \"impermeabilization at its base or not\").306 Table 7a applies to unlined pits and Table 7b to lined pits. Table 7a contains the following permissible limits:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **RAOHE Table 7a, Annex 2** |\n| **a) WITHOUT impermeabilizaron at the base** |  |\n| **Parameter** | **Expressed in** | **Unit** | **Permissible limit value** |\n| Hydrogen potential | pH | \u2014 | 6 |\n| Electrical conductivity | CE | pS/cm | 4,000 |\n| Total hydrocarbons | TPH | mg/l | <1 |\n| Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) | C | mg/l | <0,003 |\n| Cadmium | Cd | mg/l | <0.05 |\n| Total chromium | Cr | mg/l | <1.0 |\n| Vanadium | V | mg/l | <0.2 |\n| Barium | Ba | mg/l | <5 |\n|  |  |  |\n\n*Id*., p. 58, Annex 2, Table 7 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n*Ibid*. (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n179.\n\nAnd Table 7b contains the following limits:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **RAOHE Table 7b, Annex 2** |  |\n| **b) WITH impermeabilizaron at the base** |  |  |\n| **Parameter** | **Expressed in** | **Unit** | **Permissible limit value** |\n| Hydrogen potential | pH | \u2014 | 4 |\n| Electrical conductivity | CE | pS/cm | 8,000 |\n| Total hydrocarbons | TPH | mg/l | <50 |\n| Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) | C | mg/l | <0,005 |\n| Cadmium | Cd | mg/l | <0.5 |\n| Total chromium | Cr | mg/l | <10.0 |\n| Vanadium | V | mg/l | <2 |\n| Barium | Ba | mg/l | <10 |\n\n180.\n\nRAOHE Table 7 further indicates that, in addition to the initial analysis of the mud drillings and cuttings for final disposal, the operator must undertake periodic sampling and analysis of the pit (i) seven days after the disposal, (ii) three months after the disposal, and (iii) six months after the disposal.307\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**2.6 Unified Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation (TULAS)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nTULAS was promulgated on 31 March 2003 in furtherance of the principles established in the EML.308 It deals *inter alia* with the environmental authorities, environmental management, forest regime, biodiversity, coastal resources, environmental quality, the special regime of the Gal\u00e1pagos, the Institute for the eco-development of the Amazon region or ECORAE, and a special tax regime for the use of resources under the authority of the Ministry of the Environment.\n\n2nd SMCC, note 30.\n\n182.\n\nThe provisions relevant to the present case are found in Book VI of TULAS, which is composed of a number of sections and annexes. TULAS establishes a Single Environmental Management System (the \"SUMA\") in order to ensure *inter alia* the State's oversight of compliance with environmental management plans of regulated entities.309 One of the main objectives of TULAS, in particular in Title IV, is to provide the necessary regulations in pursuance of the Environmental Management Law for the Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination.310 Article 42 of Title IV provides that TULAS seeks to \"determine, at the national level, the permissible limits for discharges into water bodies or sewer systems; emissions in the air, including noise, vibrations and other forms of energy; wastes, application and disposal of liquids, solids or a combination, into the soil\", and to \"establish the quality criteria of a resource and criteria or objectives of remediation of an impacted resource\".311\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Title I, Article 2 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0204**). See also: Bed\u00f3n ER1, App. B, \u00b6 5(b).\n\nSee, for instance: TULAS, Book VI, Title I, Article 1 and Title IV (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0204**). See also: Bed\u00f3n ER1, App. B, \u00b6 5(c).\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. TULAS, Book VI, Title IV, Article 42 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0243**). Article 42 reads as follows:  \n \"Art. 42.- Specific Objectives  \n (a) To determine, at the national level, the permissible limits for discharges into water bodies or sewer systems; emissions in the air, including noise, vibrations and other forms of energy; spills, application and disposal of liquids, solids or a combination, into the soil.  \n (b) To establish the quality criteria of a resource and criteria or objectives of remediation of an impacted resource\" (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n183.\n\nArticle 45 of Title IV sets forth general principles of environmental stewardship of regulated entities, such as sustainability, equity, prior informed consent, valid representation, coordination, precaution, prevention, mitigation and remediation of negative impacts, solidarity, co-responsibility, co-operation, recycling and reuse of wastes, conservation of resources in general, minimization of wastes, use of clean technologies, alternative and environmentally sound technologies, and respect for traditional cultures and practices as well as ancestral possessions.312\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Title IV, Article 45 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0244**).\n\n184.\n\nChapter IV of Title IV addresses environmental control techniques, such as environmental impact studies, environmental management plans, environmental audits, and inspections.313 In this context, Article 70 specifies that the approval of environmental management plans or other environmental studies cannot exonerate operators from liability for environmental contamination.314 Chapter V sets out the rights and obligations of regulated entities, such as the duties to submit annual reports on environmental monitoring,315 to obtain approval of environmental management plans and environmental audits,316 to immediately notify emergency situations,317 and to obtain permits for discharges or emissions.318 Finally, Chapter VIII addresses environmental norms, including the various stages for the elaboration of standards in pursuance of Article 4 of the EML.\n\nTULAS, Book, VI, Title IV, Chapter IV, in particular Articles 58-62 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 02490250**).\n\nTULAS, Book, VI, Title IV, Article 70 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0252-0253**).\n\n*Id*., Article 80 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0255-0256**).\n\n*Id*., Article 82 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0256**).\n\n*Id*., Article 87 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0257-0258**).\n\n*Id*., Article 96 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0260**).\n\n185.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, TULAS sets out general rules for the evaluation of environmental impacts of water and soil resources \"from a technical perspective\".319 TULAS is therefore complementary to RAOHE, since it supplies chemical parameters not present in RAOHE and also provides for the application of background values.320\n\n2nd SMCC, note 30.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 170-171.\n\n186.\n\nBy contrast, according to Burlington, RAOHE is the primary source of environmental obligations of oilfield operators in Ecuador, because, unlike the more general TULAS, it expressly and specifically applies to oilfield operations, and TULAS merely supplements RAOHE. Burlington submits that the rules in RAOHE trump the more general regulations contained in TULAS, except where RAOHE is silent. This is so, for instance, with respect to some soil contaminants that are not listed in RAOHE Table 6, Annex 2.321\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 108; Bed\u00f3n ER1, \u00b6 31. Professor Bed\u00f3n explained that \"TULAS is applied in a general manner to all of those activities that may cause an impact that requires environmental authorization. The activities that have a specific regulation due to their subject matter, such as those for hydrocarbons, mining or telecommunications, must be carried out pursuant to said specific regulation and resort to the regulations of TULAS only in the absence of a specific regulation, in which case TULAS will be applied in a supplementary manner\". Bed\u00f3n ER1, App. B, \u00b6 5(a).\n\n187.\n\nThe Annexes to Book VI of TULAS establish the limits for different environmental media.322 For present purposes, Annex 1 relating to the quality of water resources and effluent discharge standards and Annex 2 relating to soil quality standards and remediation criteria are of particular relevance.\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Annexes 1-6 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0312-0496**). See also: Bed\u00f3n ER1, note 26.\n\n188.\n\nTurning first to soil quality, Annex 2, entitled \"Environmental Quality Standard for Soil Resources and Remediation Criteria for Contaminated Soils\", sets out regulatory standards in furtherance of the EML and the Regulation of the EML for the Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination. Its application is mandatory across the entire Ecuadorian territory.323 Its main objective is to prevent and control soil contamination, so as to preserve the integrity of humans, ecosystems and their interrelationships, as well as the environment at large.324 To this end, it establishes (i) norms of general application for soils with distinct uses, (ii) soil quality standards, (iii) remediation criteria for contaminated soils, and (iv) technical norms for the evaluation of the agrological capacity of soils.325\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Introduction (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0367** ; **Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0005**).\n\n*Id,* Article 1 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0367** ; **Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0005**).\n\n*Id*., Introduction (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0367** ; **Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0005**).\n\n189.\n\nArticle 4.1.2 deals with activities that are degrading the soil quality.326 It provides that public or private entities engaged *inter alia* in hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation must take the necessary measures to avoid harm to soils.327 Article 4.1.3, relating to contaminated soils, states that contamination due to spills or leaks must be remediated taking into account \"the remediation criteria for contaminated soils found in [TULAS]\".328 It prescribes that the competent regulatory authority must request that remediation and monitoring be undertaken until the \"remediation objectives or remediation values\" established in TULAS are achieved.329 It further states that \"in case of the inapplicability for the specific case of any parameter established in [TULAS] or in case of the absence in the regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil under study\", the regulated entity must establish the \"background or reference value of the parameter of interest present in the soil\" in the affected area, in order to compare the actual values with these background values.330 This provision further indicates that a concentration exceeding three times the background value for the soil constitutes contamination that requires \"immediate attention\" on the part of the environmental control authority.331 In such cases, the regulated entity must remediate the contaminated soil until the concentration is lower or equal to 1.5 times the background value.332\n\n*Id*., Article 4.1.2 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0380**).\n\n*Id*., Article 4.1.2.1 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0380**).\n\n*Id*., Article 4.1.3.1 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0381** ; **Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0006**).\n\n*Id*., Article 4.1.3.2 (**Exh.

EL-173 (EN) 0006**).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Id*., paragraph 2.\n\n190.\n\nArticle 4.2 establishes soil quality standards and remediation standards. It defines soil quality standards as \"approximate background values or analytical detection limits for a contaminant in the soil\".333 Background values refer to \"representative environmental levels for a contaminant in the soil\", which can reflect natural geological variations of undeveloped areas or areas free of the influence of generalized industrial or urban activities.334 Table 2 sets out soil quality standards, comprising 3 general parameters (electric conductivity, pH and sodium adsorption ratio), 19 inorganic parameters (including arsenic, barium, cadmium, total chromium, mercury, nickel, lead, vanadium and zinc), and 14 organic parameters (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).335 The table below sets out the relevant parameters:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Excerpts of TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Table 2** |\n| **Substance** | **Units** **(Concentration in Dry Weight)** | **Soil** |\n| **General Parameters** |\n| Conductivity | mmhos/cm | 2 |\n| pH |  | 6 to 8 |\n| **Inorganic Parameters** |\n| Arsenic | mg/kg | 5 |\n| Barium | mg/kg | 200 |\n| Cadmium | mg/kg | 0.5 |\n| Total Chromium | mg/kg | 20 |\n| Nickel | mg/kg | 20 |\n| Lead | mg/kg | 25 |\n| Vanadium | mg/kg | 25 |\n| **Organic Parameters** |\n| Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons | mg/kg | 0.1 |\n\n*Id*., Article 4.2.1 (**Exh.

EL-173 (EN) 0007-0008**).\n\n191.\n\nIn this context, Article 2.38 of Annex 2 defines background values as the \"prevailing environmental conditions, prior to any disturbance\", that is, the \"conditions that would have predominated in the absence of anthropogenic activities, with only natural processes being active\".336\n\n*Id*., Article 2.38 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0373** ; **Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0005**).\n\n192.\n\nArticle 4.2.2 defines soil remediation or restoration standards in accordance with the use of the soil, distinguishing agricultural, commercial, residential and industrial uses. The standards set out in Table 3 are meant to determine the \"maximum contaminant concentration levels for soil in the process of remediation or restoration\".337 It contains the following relevant parameters:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Excerpts of TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Table 3** |\n| **Substance** | **Units** | **Land Use** |\n| Agricultural | Residential | Commercial | Industrial |\n| **General Parameters** |\n| Electrical Conductivity | mmhos/cm | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 |\n| pH |  | 6 to 8 | 6 to 8 | 6 to 8 | 6 to 8 |\n| **Inorganic Parameters** |\n| Arsenic | mg/kg | 12 | 15 | 15 | 15 |\n| Barium | mg/kg | 750 | 500 | 2000 | 2000 |\n| Cadmium | mg/kg | 2 | 5 | 10 | 10 |\n| Total Chromium | mg/kg | 65 | 65 | 90 | 90 |\n| Nickel | mg/kg | 50 | 100 | 100 | 100 |\n| Lead | mg/kg | 100 | 100 | 150 | 150 |\n| Vanadium | mg/kg | 130 | 130 | 130 | 130 |\n| **Organic Parameters** |\n| Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons | mg/kg | < 2 |  | < 5 | < 1 |\n\n*Id*., Article 4.2.2 (**Exh.

EL-173 (EN) 0009**).\n\n193.\n\nComing now to groundwater, Annex 1 of Book VI of TULAS determines (a) permissible limits for discharges into water bodies or sewer systems, (b) water quality standards according to their various uses, and (c) methods and procedures to determine the presence of contaminants in water.338 Its objective is to prevent and control contamination of water resources, to preserve the integrity of humans, ecosystems and their interrelationships, as well as the environment more generally.339\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Introduction (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0312**).\n\n*Id.*, Article 1 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0312**).\n\n194.\n\nArticle 4.1.3 addresses quality standards for groundwater.340 It stipulates that any proven alteration of the quality of groundwater triggers the duty to remediate the contaminated groundwater and the affected soil.341 Table 5 sets out the quality standards for groundwater \"considering a soil with clay content between (0-25.0)% and organic material content between (0-10.0)%\".342 It contains the following relevant parameters:\n\n**Excerpts of TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5**\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Parameters** | **Expressed As** | **Unit** | **Maximum Permissible Limit** |\n| Arsenic (total) | As | Mg/l | 35 |\n| Barium | Ba | Mg/l | 338 |\n| Cadmium | Cd | Mg/l | 3,2 |\n| Cobalt | Co | Mg/l | 60 |\n| Copper | Cu | Mg/l | 45 |\n| Total Chromium | Cr | Mg/l | 16 |\n| Molybdenum | Mo | Mg/l | 153 |\n| Mercury (total) | Hg | Mg/l | 0,18 |\n| Nickel | Ni | Mg/l | 45 |\n| Lead | Pb | Mg/l | 45 |\n| Zinc | Zn | Mg/l | 433 |\n| Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons |  | Mg/l | 325 |\n|  |\n\n*Id.*, Article 4.1.3 (**Exh.

Most notably, the new Constitution bestows rights to nature (called *Pacha Mama* using the term employed in traditional Andean cultures) and codifies the fundamental principles of environmental stewardship. It declares that the elimination of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development, as well as the equitable redistribution of resources and wealth are fundamental duties of the State.343 It also specifies that constitutional principles and rights, including those relating to environmental matters, are \"unalienable, obligatory, indivisible, interdependent and of equal importance\".344\n\nConstituci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, published in the Official Register of 20 October 2008, Article 3(5) (**Exh. C-413**). Except where otherwise indicated, the English translations are from the Claimant.\n\n*Id*., Article 11(6).\n\n196.\n\nAddressing first the rights of nature, the Tribunal notes Article 10 providing that \"[n]ature shall be the subject of those rights that the Constitution recognizes for it\". These rights are then specified in Articles 71 to 74.\n\n197.\n\nArticle 71 declares that \"Nature or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes\".\n\n198.\n\nArticle 72 further provides that \"Nature has the right to be restored\" and that the duty to restore nature runs in parallel to the duty to compensate individuals and communities that depend on affected natural systems.345 The exploitation of non-renewable natural resources leading to \"severe or permanent environmental impact\" must be subject to \"the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration\", including through \"adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences\".346\n\n*Id*., Article 72(1) (Translation by the Claimant). The translation provided by Ecuador reads as follows: \"Nature has the right to restoration\" (**Exh.

Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State\").\n\n201.\n\nTurning then to environmental protection in general, the Constitution declares as matters of \"public interest\", *inter alia*, environmental conservation, the protection of ecosystems, biodiversity, the prevention of environmental damage and the recovery of degraded natural spaces.349 The Constitution further recognizes the \"right of the population to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment that guarantees sustainability and *the good way of living* (*sumak kawsay*)\".350 In this context, the State is called upon to promote the use of environmentally clean technologies, nonpolluting and low-impact alternative sources of energy, while certain noxious substances, such as highly toxic persistent organic pollutants or toxic wastes, are forbidden.351\n\n*Id*., Article 14(2).\n\n*Id.*, Article 14(1). The *Good Way of Living System*, is further expanded on in Title VII, Articles 340 to 415, focusing on inclusion and equity on the one hand (Chapter I), and biodiversity and natural resources on the other hand (Chapter II).\n\n*Id.*, Article 15.\n\n202.\n\nThe Constitution also highlights the special value of the Amazon ecosystem, providing that, in addition to the regular territorial subdivisions, special systems may be established for reasons of environmental conservation.352 With respect to the Amazonian region, Article 250 insists on the conservation of its ecosystem as part of the planet's environmental equilibrium:\n\n\"The territory of the Amazon provinces is part of an ecosystem that is necessary for the planet's environmental balance of the planet [sic]. This territory shall constitute a special territorial district, for which there will be integrated planning embodied in a law including social, economic, environmental and cultural aspects, with land use development and planning that ensures the conservation and protection of its ecosystems and the principle of *sumak kawsay* (*the good way of living*)\".353\n\n*Id.*, Article 242(1).\n\n*Id.*, Article 250.\n\n203.\n\nTo implement these objectives, Article 259 requires the State to adopt sustainable development policies:\n\n\"With the aim of safeguarding the biodiversity of the Amazon ecosystem, the central State and decentralized autonomous governments shall adopt sustainable development policies which shall also offset disparities in their development and consolidate sovereignty\".354\n\n*Id.*, Article 259.\n\n204.\n\nIn connection with the economic aspects of environmental protection, the Constitution reserves the State's powers to administer, regulate, monitor and manage strategic sectors,355 such as the hydrocarbons industry,356 in accordance with \"the principles of environmental sustainability, precaution, prevention and efficiency\".357 Only on an exceptional basis may the State delegate to private enterprise the management of strategic resources, including the sustainable use of natural resources.358\n\nStrategic sectors come under the \"exclusive control of the State\" and are defined as those sectors \"that, due to their importance and size, exert a decisive economic, social, political or environmental impact and must be aimed at ensuring the full exercise of rights and the general welfare of society\". *Id.*, Article 313(2).\n\nStrategic sectors are \"energy in all its forms, telecommunications, nonrenewable natural resources, oil and gas transport and refining, biodiversity and genetic heritage, the radio spectrum, water and others as established by law\". *Id*., Article 313(3).\n\n*Id.*, Article 313(1).\n\n*Id.*, Article 316(2).\n\n205.\n\nNon-renewable natural resources are declared part of the \"unalienable heritage of the State and are not subject to a statute of limitations\".359 Their management must take into account the \"responsibility between generations\" and \"the conservation of nature\" as well as the objective to \"minimize the negative impacts of an environmental, cultural, social and economic nature\".360 Water, as a \"vital element for nature and human existence\", forms part of the \"country's strategic heritage for public use\" which is \"unalienable\" and imprescriptible property of the State.361\n\n*Id.*, Article 317, 1st sentence.\n\n*Id*., Article 317, 2nd sentence.\n\n*Id.*, Article 318(1).\n\n206.\n\nOf particular relevance for present purposes is Chapter II of Title VII which deals with biodiversity and natural resources management as part of the so-called *Good Way of Living System*.

Having articulated the principles of prevention and precaution,372 it provides in paragraph 2 that strict liability governs environmental harm and that full restoration of ecosystems must be achieved in addition to compensating affected persons and communities:\n\n\"Responsibility for environmental damage is objective. All damage to the environment, in addition to the respective penalties, shall also entail the obligation to integrally restoring the ecosystems and compensating the affected persons and communities\".373\n\n*Id.*, Article 396(1) (\"The State shall adopt timely policies and measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts where there is certainty about the damage. In the case of doubt about the environmental impact stemming from a deed or omission, although there is no scientific evidence of the damage, the State shall adopt effective and timely measures of protection\"). The translation provided by Ecuador reads as follows: \"The State shall adopt the appropriate policies and measures to avoid negative environmental impacts, where there is a certainty of harm. In the case of doubt regarding the environmental impact of an action or omission, even where there is no scientific evidence of the harm, the State shall adopt effective and appropriate measures of protection\" (**Exh.

C-1 Corrected translation** ; **CE-CC-28**). Similarly, Clause 5.1.17 of the Block 21 PSC provides that the Contractor shall \"comply with all the laws, regulations and any other applicable provisions of the Republic of Ecuador\" (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\nClause 5.1.8 of the Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\nClause 5.1.4 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). Under Clause 5.1.11 of the Block 7 PSC, the Contractor agreed to provide to the Ministry of Energy and Mines these environmental impact studies and any supporting documentation. Under Clause 5.1.20.3 of the Block 7 PSC, the Contractor confirmed that \"as of the effective date\" of the contract, it had completed the required environmental impact studies, and that they had been submitted and approved by the Undersecretary of the Environment. Clause 5.1.20.4 of the Block 7 PSC states that any additional environmental studies that would be required for additional oilfield activities have to be submitted in accordance with the RAOHE. Clause 3.3.12 defines environmental impact studies as follows: \"Environmental Impact Study (EIS): Is the document whereby the Contractor reports the risks and potential positive and negative effects which hydrocarbon operations or other activities foreign to the ecosystem could have on nature and social organizations, and the measures that shall be taken in order to prevent, control, and mitigate the risks and negative effects, as well as the necessary actions to rehabilitate affected areas\". Clause 5.1.20.4 spells out the content of environmental impact studies, as including (i) an inventory and diagnostic (baseline) study to determine the environmental situation and the level of contamination in the Contract Area, including a description of natural resources, in particular forests, flora and fauna; (ii) a description and technical evaluation of the foreseeable direct and indirect effects on the physical, biotic and social environment, in the short and long term; (iii) a detailed environmental management plan, aimed at avoiding exceeding the maximum tolerable levels; and (iv) and abandonment plan for the area. Since the Block 21 PSC was executed prior to any oilfield operations, that contract is drafted in different terms, indicating that exploration had to be undertaken within 6 months of the so-called \"effective date\", which is defined in Clause 3.3.15 as the \"date of approval of the Environmental Impact Study by the Ministry of the Environment for the seismic prospection phase of Block 21\" (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\nClause 5.1.10 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). Compare with: Clause 5.1.9 of the Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\nClause 5.1.20.6 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). Compare with: Clause 5.1.18 of the Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\n219.\n\nUnder Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 7 PSC, the Contractor agreed to \"preserve the existing ecological equilibrium in the Contract Area\" in accordance with all pertinent standards and the environmental impact studies.391 The Contractor also accepted to \"[t]hroughout the term of this Contract, take all necessary measures to conserve and safeguard life and property and to protect the environment\".392 In order to achieve these goals, the Contractor further undertook to employ \"qualified personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, operational procedures and, in general, technology which complies with environmental protection standards and practices used in the international petroleum industry, subject to compliance with existing standards in Ecuador\".393\n\nClause 5.1.20 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). That same provision adds that the Undersecretary of Environmental Protection \"may request the performance of studies complementary to\" already existing environmental impact studies.\n\nClause 5.1.20.8 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). Clause 5.1.19 of the Block 21 PSC reads as follows: \"While conducting the operations, the Contractor shall take every necessary measure to ensure the preservation and safety of lives and properties and preserve the environment. The above notwithstanding, the Contractor shall not be responsible for changes to the ecosystem caused by third parties within the Contract Area\" (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\nClause 5.1.20.9 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). Clause 5.1.7 of the Block 21 PSC is worded slightly differently: \"To use personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, and technology in accordance with the best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbon industry\" (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\n220.\n\nThe Block 7 and Block 21 PSCs also addressed the issue of remediation and postoperations cleanup, in particular by providing that the Contractor would not be liable for preexisting environmental conditions (prior to the Services Contract for Block 7, and prior to the Participation Contract for Block 21), or for environmental conditions resulting from operations that are subsequent to the expiry of the PSCs. Clause 5.1.20.10 of Block 7 PSC reads as follows:\n\n\"The Contractor will take responsibility for cleanup and reforestation of the area with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order to, with time, allow the site to return to its original potential, with environmental conditions similar to those found at the beginning of the operations. The Contractor will also be responsible for abandonment of the wells and installations for which the Contractor has been responsible under the terms of this Contract. The cleanup, reforestation and return to similar conditions and abandonment activities will comply with the Environmental Regulations for Hydrocarbon Operations and with the provisions of the Environmental Impact Study. The Contractor will not be liable for preexisting environmental conditions at the beginning of the Service Contract activities. In situations where government authorities order remediation of the environment in the Contract Area due to preexisting conditions, the Contractor will not be liable for the costs and services. Moreover, the Contractor will not be liable for environmental conditions resulting from operations conducted by PETROECUADOR or third parties after the Contractor has returned the Contract Area\".\n\n221.\n\nSimilarly, Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 PSC reads as follows:\n\n\"The Contractor shall be responsible for the clean-up, reforestation, and abandonment of non-productive wells and facilities as a result of this Contract. These activities shall be carried out in accordance with the legislation in effect in Ecuador at the time that such clean-up, reforestation, or abandonment is carried out and as contemplated in the Environmental Impact Study.  \n The Contractor shall not be responsible for pre-existing environmental conditions at the start of the operations under the Contract.  \n In such cases where the competent authorities order mitigation of the environment in the Contract Area due to pre-existing conditions, any costs incurred in connection with such activities shall be assumed by the Ecuadorian State.  \n Nor shall the Contractor be responsible for environmental conditions resulting from operations by PETROECUADOR or third parties after the Contract Area is returned by the Contractor\".394\n\nClause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\n222.\n\nFinally, in the context of the Contracts' termination, the PSCs specify that the Consortium was to undertake a \"comprehensive environmental audit\" two years prior to the termination of the PSC. Clause 5.1.20.7 of the Block 7 PSC, for instance, reads as follows:\n\n\"Two (2) years prior to the termination date of this Contract, the Contractor will contract a comprehensive environmental audit of the Contract Area, based on the Environmental Impact Studies, and this audit must be completed no later than six (6) months prior to the termination date of this Contract. The final results of the audit will be binding for the Parties. The cost of performing the audit will be paid by the Parties in equal proportions (50/50). This audit will be performed by a company selected by mutual agreement of the Parties in a written agreement and the audit will comply with applicable Ecuadorian Law. The parties who perform these studies and audits must be previously qualified by the Ministry of Environment through the Undersecretary of the Environment\".395\n\nClause 5.1.20.7 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1 Corrected translation** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). Compare with: Clause 5.5.5 of the Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\n**3. Conditions of liability**\n------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by reviewing the liability regime applicable to hazardous activities, such as oilfield operations, in Ecuador (3.1). It will then address the statute of limitation (3.2) and the liability for successive operators (3.3).\n\n**3.1 The liability regime for hydrocarbons operations in Ecuador**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal is called to rule on Burlington's possible liability in tort, as opposed to contractual liability under the PSCs. It will thus review the tort liability regime for environmental harm as it arises from the 2008 Constitution (3.1.1) and as it existed before (3.1.2), to then draw the necessary conclusions for the case at hand.\n\n**3.1.1 The strict liability regime under the 2008 Constitution**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Parties agree, and rightly so, that the 2008 Constitution establishes strict liability for environmental harm.396 The Constitution also sets the following rules of the strict liability regime: (i) the burden of proof of the inexistence of harm falls on the operator;397 (ii) the operator is only responsible for the harm caused by him;398 and environmental claims are imprescriptible.399\n\nArticle 396(2): \"Responsibility for environmental harm is objective. All damage to the environment, in addition to the respective penalties, shall also entail the obligation of integrally restoring the ecosystems and compensating the affected persons and communities\" (**Exh. C-413**).\n\nArticle 397(1), 2nd sentence: \"The burden of proof regarding the absence of potential or real danger shall lie with the operator of the activity or the defendant\" (**Exh. C-413**).\n\nArticle 396(3): \"Each one of the players in the processes of production, distribution, marketing and use of goods or services shall accept direct responsibility for preventing any environmental impact, for mitigating and repairing the damages caused, and for maintaining an ongoing environmental monitoring system\" (**Exh. C-413**).\n\nArticle 396(4): \"The legal proceedings to prosecute and punish those responsible for environmental damages shall not be subject to any statute of limitations\" (**Exh. C-413**).\n\n226.\n\nThe constitutional regime has been clarified in case law. Specifically, the burden of proof of environmental harm was addressed in *Los Vencedores*, a decision dealing with a claim against Perenco for soil contamination in Block 7 that occurred after the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution.400 The Court held that the burden of proving harm had been reversed by Article 397(1) of the 2008 Constitution, which provides that \"[t]he burden of proof regarding the inexistence of potential or real harm shall lie with the manager of the activity or the defendant\". The Tribunal's understanding is that the plaintiff still has the burden to make a showing of harm plausibly connected to the defendant's activities and the defendant then has the burden of proving its absence.\n\n*Irma A. Imbaquingo et al. v. Perenco Ecuador Limited*, Provincial Court of Justice of Orellana, Ecuador, 17 September 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 5.2, 5.7, 6.7 (**Exh. CA-CC-57**).\n\n227.\n\nApplied to the present case, the rule contained in Article 397(1) means that once Ecuador has made a showing of the existence of environmental harm reasonably related to the Consortium's risky activities, for example by way of the IEMS sampling exercise, Burlington then carries the burden of demonstrating that there is no harm or, if there is harm, what its limits are.\n\n228.\n\nEcuadorian courts have also held that fault is not a requirement of strict liability. The National Court of Justice explained that strict civil liability is the equivalent of \"risk liability\" or \"fault-less liability\" that is triggered \"regardless of whether there was willful misconduct or negligence from the person\".401 The Court added that the duty to repair environmental harm is based on the fact that the harm caused \"may be materially attributed to a certain activity, not on the existence of fault\".402\n\n*Aguinda v. Chevron,* pp. 211 -212 (**Exh. EL-233**).\n\n*Ibid*. The National Court of Justice also cited Resolution No. 378-1999 (Tercera Sala, R.O. No. 23, 23 II del 2000) where it is stated: \"The principle that any harm should be repaired gives rise to entirely reconsidering the law of liability. From this principle derives strict liability, in which it is not necessary for fault to link the damaging act with the victim, since the production of harm may be sufficient [\u2026]\". *Id*., pp. 115-116 (**Exh. EL-233**).\n\n229.\n\nApplied to this case, the absence of a requirement of fault implies that Burlington may not avoid liability by raising that it acted diligently.\n\n230.\n\nAnother element of strict liability addressed by the courts is the requirement of causation. Under the strict liability regime, causation is presumed. In *Aguinda*, the National Court of Justice referred to the *Delfina Torres* decision, where it was held that under strict liability the operator could only escape liability by showing that the harm was caused by *force majeure* (*hecho fortuito*), a third party or the victim.403\n\n*Id*., p. 210, referring to: *Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador,* p. 28 (**Exh. EL-160**).\n\n231.\n\nThe reliance on a presumption of causation under the constitutional regime is further substantiated by the Final Report of Committee 5 on Natural Resources and Biodiversity of the Constituent Assembly that prepared the 2008 Constitution. This report explains that the reversal of the burden of proving harm is due to the need to establish a \"presumption of innocence\" in favor of the environment,404 which, in turn, entails a reversal of the burden of proving the causal nexus between the act and the damage:\n\n\"The presumption of innocence should be established in favour of the environment. From this perspective, the burden of proof should be reversed to be against the defendant [\u2026], in other words, counter to the former principle which assumes innocence until guilt is proven, strict liability would be the defense in environmental matters. The plaintiff will not be required to prove causal nexus, and the burden of proof would correspond to the defendant. This principle eliminates one of the barriers impeding access to environmental justice, which is the cost of producing evidence and the technical requirement to prove environmental damages\".405\n\nTranslation by Ecuador. Constituent Assembly of Ecuador, *Final Report of Committee 5 Natural Resources and Biodiversity,* 2008, p. 15 (**Crespo ER, Exh. 9**).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n232.\n\nFor present purposes, this holding means that Burlington can be exempted from liability if it proves that the harm was caused by *force majeure*, by a third party, or by Ecuador and in particular by Petroamazonas after the takeover of the Blocks.406 Burlington accepts that the strict liability regime established under the 2008 Constitution involves \"some burden shifting within the concept of causation\". It insists, however, that Ecuador needed first to prove that the harm \"occurred on the Consortium's watch\", after which Burlington could show that the harm was caused by force majeure, the victim or a third party.407 While the Tribunal will revert to the issue of successive tort liability, it disagrees with Burlington's position that Ecuador must prove that the harm was caused during the time of the Consortium's operations. Indeed, proof of causation is not required. Causation is presumed, with the result that liability ensues from the mere exercise of a risky activity and the occurrence of harm that is plausibly connected to such activity as far as the type and location of the harm is concerned.\n\n*Aguinda v. Chevron,* p. 210 (**Exh. EL-233**).\n\n\"It's typical in a strict liability regime that you would have some burden shifting within the concept of causation. So, for example, under a strict liability regime like the 2008 Constitution, if a claimant can prove that a certain type of harm occurred on the Consortium's watch, then it's up to the Consortium as the defendant at that point to say, well, that event, although it occurred on my watch, was actually caused by a third party, someone from outside came in and sabotaged the well or something of that nature\". Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 214:1-11 (Opening, Coriell).\n\n233.\n\nThe constitutional regime just described has no retroactive effect. Indeed, Article 7 of the Civil Code restates the general principle that laws have no retroactive effect.408 It is true that the decision in *Baquerizo* held that rules of public order do apply retroactively.409 However, environmental protection is not a matter of public order under the 2008 Constitution. It is merely a matter of public interest. Public interest, which is dealt with in Article 14 of the Constitution cannot be equated with public order, the latter notion being more restrictive than the former. As a result, there is no room to apply a rule on environmental protection such as the imprescriptibility of claims under Article 396(4) retroactively.\n\nArticle 7 CC reads as follows: \"The law does not provide but for what is to come; it has no retroactive effect\" (**Exh. CA-CC-38**).\n\n*Baquerizo G. C. Ltda. v. Shulton Inc.*, Supreme Court of Justice, Third Civil and Mercantile Chamber, published in Judicial Gazette No. 12, 25 September 2003 (**Exh. CA-CC-29**).\n\n**3.1.2 The liability regime for hydrocarbons operations prior to the 2008 Constitution**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution not applying retroactively, the Tribunal must assess the rules governing liability for hydrocarbons operations prior to the 2008 Constitution.\n\n235.\n\nThe Parties diverge on whether these rules provided for fault-based or strict liability. Burlington argues in favor of the former, with the result that Ecuador must prove the existence of environmental harm and that the harm was caused by the Consortium's lack of diligence, that is, its fault. In other words, for Burlington, Ecuador must prove harm, fault and causation. For its part, Ecuador argues that the Consortium's activities were always subject to strict liability, or at the latest since the 2002 *Delfina Torres* decision of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court. Accordingly, says Ecuador, Burlington can only be exonerated if it establishes that the harm was caused by *force majeure*, a third party or the victim.410 A showing of diligence, or lack of fault, would not suffice.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 5; Crespo ER, \u00b6 37.\n\n236.\n\nPrior to the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution, tort liability was governed by the Civil Code. While liability was fault-based, the Civil Code also provided for an objective liability standard applicable to particular situations.411 Moreover, the Ecuadorian courts, especially the Supreme Court in the *Delfina Torres* case, had extended objective liability to hazardous activities such as oilfield operations based on the theory of risk.412 In *Delfina Torres,* the Supreme Court of Justice provided the legal foundations for risk based liability in the following language:\n\n\"Today's world and the coming world, with its extraordinary and progressive accumulation of risks, requires greater defense of the values of man, created by a technology that, while it enables everything, it also threatens everything. The variety of real contingencies of dangers and risks that are actually drawn as a result of dissatisfaction and aside from any idea of damages, led to a slow evolution of elements and knowledge that enabled the most advanced legal systems to enter into socialization regimes of risk leading to the proposition that the victim is not left defenseless. This gave rise to the theory of risk, according to which, he who uses and takes advantage of any type of means that endow it with benefits, generates social risks through such means, and, as a result of that circumstance, must assume liability for harm caused by them [\u2026]. No fault or wrongfulness is required to recognize tort liability. It is enough that the harm is a direct consequence of the event that has caused it. It is purely strict liability\".413\n\nArt. 2229 (prior to 2005, Article 2256) CC reads in relevant part: \"The following are particularly liable for reparation: [\u2026] 3. He who removes slabs from an irrigation ditch or pipe in a street or path, without the precautions necessary so that those walking or traveling around the area during the day or night do not fall; [\u2026] 4. He who, being compelled to build or repair a water line or bridge crossing a path, keeps it in a condition that may be harmful to those transiting through it\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. CA-CC-38**).\n\nDelfina Torres v. Petroecuador (**Exh. EL-160**).\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. *Id*., pp. 27-28, \u00b6 20.\n\n237.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice then identified the elements of strict liability showing that it is for the alleged tort feasor to prove that he or she did not cause the harm:\n\n\"Hence, the need arises to promulgate a new type of liability for this type of harm, eliminating the criteria of fault through strict liability or the establishment of an absolute presumption of such. The owner of an exploitation or industry should respond directly for harm caused by the referenced industry or exploitation, and he may only exempt himself from liability if he shows that the harm did not arise from the exploitation, and arose instead from a foreign act (force majeure, fault of a third party or the fault of the victim itself)\".414\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. *Id*., pp. 28-29, \u00b6 20.\n\n238.\n\nAccordingly, the following elements are characteristic of the strict liability regime for environmental harm under Ecuadorian law as established in *Delfina Torres* :\n\n(i) the plaintiff must prove harm connected to the defendant's activities;\n\n(ii) fault is not required; and\n\n(iii) causation is presumed, the defendant being exonerated if he or she proves that the harm was caused by *force majeure*, the victim or a third party.\n\n239.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice also held in *Medardo Luna* that fault is not required for strict liability.415 In the context of the Code of Aeronautics, the *Medardo Luna* court held that it was irrelevant whether the company followed applicable regulations and whether the pilot acted with care.416\n\n*Medardo Luna c. AECA,* Corte Suprema de Justicia, 20 September 2004, p.4,\u00b6 3 (**Exh. CA-CC-32**) : \"[I]n strict liability, however, the individual identified as the culprit is imposed the obligation to compensate the victim, regardless of foresight or intent that the aforementioned may have had from the damage resulting from the accident. In other words, the party acting out of malice, negligence or inexperience is no longer solely responsible, but responsibility also lies upon the individual that created the hazardous activity or used the riskful asset\".\n\n*Id.*, p. 5, \u00b6 4, where the following is stated: \"it is unquestionable that said company incurred in extracontractual civil liability; being it irrelevant whether said company complied with the regulating standards for flight security, or whether the pilot took the precautions indicated for the case\".\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties' experts disagree on whether fault is not a requirement of strict liability at all or whether it remains a requirement but is presumed. Differently worded, they disagree on whether there is a rebuttable presumption of fault (Burlington) or an irrebuttable one (Ecuador). The Respondent's expert Professor Andrade speaks of an irrebuttable presumption (\"*presunci\u00f3n de culpabilidad absoluta*\"),417 while the Claimant's expert Professor Bed\u00f3n considers the presumption to be *iuris tantum*, that is rebuttable.418 The analysis of the *Delfina Torres* and *Medardo Luna* decisions just referred to show that the presumption of fault cannot be rebutted by a showing that all precautions have been followed. Only a showing of *force majeure*, an act of a third party or of the victim can exonerate the defendant.419\n\nAndrade ER, \u00b6 58.\n\nBed\u00f3n ER1, \u00b6 75.\n\nSee, in particular: \"hence, the need arises to promulgate a new type of liability for this type of harm, *eliminating the criteria of fault through strict liability, or establishing an absolute presumption of fault*\" (emphasis and translation by the Tribunal). *Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador*, \u00b6 20 (**Exh. EL-160**).\n\n241.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to adopt the position that the pre-2008 strict liability regime implies a rebuttable presumption of fault, any exceedance of RAOHE or TULAS values would defeat a due diligence argument. In addition, the non-compliances identified by Ecuador's expert RPS in connection with the biennial audits for instance,420 as well as evidence of Mr. Saltos, one of Burlington's witnesses, on various practices of the Consortium (discharges, mud pits, spills), would produce the same result.\n\nRPS ER2, Section 6.\n\n242.\n\nMore specifically, RPS reviewed the compliance record of the Consortium in environmental matters and identified the following non-compliances during the Consortium's operatorship: (i) failure to conduct biennial environmental audits in 2004 in breach of Article 42 of RAOHE and Article 61 of Book VI of TULAS; (ii) lack of key environmental documents, such as environmental management plans and environmental licenses; (iii) irregularities in the management of drill cuttings and mud pits, such as exceedances in maximum permissible limits of leachates in unlined pits; (iv) exceedances in maximum permissible limits for wastewater, as well as soil quality; (v) additional non-compliances, such as irregular waste and chemical management, or failure to respect a \"highly sensitive ecological area\" in Block 21; and (vi) environmental liabilities associated with the Payamino field operations resulting in offsite contamination and affecting third parties.421\n\nRPS ER2, pp. 85-103.\n\n243.\n\nThese instances refute Burlington's contention that the Consortium complied with all regulatory requirements.422 It is further preoccupying that the Consortium was operating the Coca-Payamino, Jaguar, Mono and Gacela fields without any proper environmental license423 and was relying on an outdated environmental impact study for the Coca-Payamino Field.424 And while the Consortium sought to downplay the fact that it produced no biennial environmental audit in 2004, the Subsecretary of Environmental Protection held this omission to be a serious breach of RAOHE.425 In this overall context, the Tribunal further observes that Burlington has not put into the record any baseline studies or internal due diligence studies generated at the outset of operations, allowing to assess the environmental condition of the Blocks at the start of operations as well as preexisting environmental liabilities.426\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 140. See also: Saltos WS1, \u00b6 112.\n\nRPS ER2, Section 6.2.2, p. 89.\n\n*Id*., Section 6.2.3, pp. 89-90.\n\n*Id*., Section 6.2.1, p. 88.\n\nArticle 41, Section 6(5) RAOHE reads: \"In the intervened zones, it is necessary for the Baseline to include an analysis of prior impacts caused by other activities\" (Translation by the Tribunal). Article 41, Section 6(6) reads in relevant part: \"The choice of assessment and evaluation techniques shall be at the discretion of the party conducting the study; however, care shall be taken to: - Analyze the prior environmental situation (Baseline) in comparison with the environmental transformations resulting from the hydrocarbons activities conducted\" (Translation by the Tribunal). See also: Articles 13(2), 51, 55 and 87(a) RAOHE (**Exh. EL-174**). Article 2.37 of the TULAS defines the Baseline as follows: \"Denotes the state of an altered system at a particular point in time, before a subsequent change. It is also defined as the conditions at the time of investigation within an area that may be influenced by productive or human activities\". Whereas the baseline refers to prevailing environmental conditions in an altered system, background level (*linea de fondo*) refers to prevailing environmental conditions \"prior to any disturbance\", i.e., \"conditions that would have predominated in the absence of anthropogenic activities, with only natural processes being active\". See: TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Articles 2.37-2.38 (**Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0373** ; **EL-173 (EN) 0005**).\n\n244.\n\nThe testimony of Mr. Saltos, also revealed various instances of Consortium malpractices. For instance, Mr. Saltos mentioned that production water was discharged on the sand bank of the Napo River at the Oso 4 site, so as to filter these discharges before they reached the water body.427 Mr. Saltos further testified that the Consortium was using auxiliary mud pits, such as the well workover pit in Area 2MT in Payamino 1/CPF, which is located beneath the CPF close to the A\u00f1ango River.428 Mr. Saltos also conceded that, during well workovers, the Consortium was moving drilling muds from one site to another site with open pits, eventually even reopening sealed pits to introduce newly contaminated soils.429 In addition, as the example of auxiliary pits shows, the Consortium also made use of pits that were not reported to the authorities, thus forcing Ecuador's experts to discover unreported mud pits as a result of their sampling campaigns (see, for instance, Payamino 1/CPF; Payamino 16).430 Mr. Saltos also confirmed that the collapse of the pit at C\u00f3ndor Norte due to a landslide in 2006 was not remediated until the Consortium left the Blocks in 2009.431\n\nReporte de taponamiento de piscinas de Oso 4-5, noviembre 2004, p. 5 (**Exh. E-467**) : \"Water was transported to the beach of the ballast mine, so that such beach worked as an infiltration field, thus preventing direct discharge into the river\" (Translation by the Tribunal). Mr. Saltos provided the following testimony: \"Yes, I was referring here specifically to the fact that we did not mix water to reduce exceedance and then discharge it back into the river, as you were saying. In this specific case here, what it says right here, was released into the beach. Now, the beach acts as the filter for the water, and this is probably the reason why it was done here. But it's simply because the beach allowed for that to happen\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1356:1-8 (Cross, Saltos). See also: Saltos WS2, \u00b6 26; Saltos WS2, \u00b6 29. This practice was also employed, for instance, in: Coca 18, Payamino 24.\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1228:1-17 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nFor instance, Mr. Saltos conceded that the Payamino 16 pit was reopened to deposit drilling muds from other platforms. This pit was not reported and poorly covered. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1335:9-10 and 1335:16-1336:12 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1228:1-17; 1226:8-1235:12 (Cross, Saltos) (Payamino 1/CPF); Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1335:9-10, 1335:16-1336:12 (Cross, Saltos) (Payamino 16).\n\nSaltos WS2, \u00b6 37; Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1342:3-5 (Cross, Saltos).\n\n245.\n\nWith respect to spills, the evidence provided by Mr. Manuel Sol\u00eds of Petroamazonas shows that Mr. Saltos' list of spills during the Consortium operatorship is incomplete, further showing that the Consortium did not report all spills to the authorities. Mr. Saltos confirmed that at Jaguar 1, for instance, the 2005 spill in Area 3T was left unreported and, worse, was left unremediated with a 30cm layer of clean soil having been put on top of the affected area, which is not more than 8 meters away from a water body in close proximity to human dwellings and a school.432 Mr. Saltos also testified at Coca CPF during the Site Visit that, while the malpractice of prior operators in discharging produced water into the drainage leading to the Chal\u00e1 swamp was discontinued and remediated, oil seeping continued during the Consortium's operatorship without any proper remediation being undertaken by the Consortium.433\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1246:8-1247:20, 1253:7-10 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nSaltos WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 290, 294, 297; Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 139:17-23 (Tribunal, Saltos at Coca CPF). \"Unfortunately, it continued discharging water from the API separator, and this water may have had traces of hydrocarbons that ended up in the swamp. And, logically, they continued to go through the swamp until they reached Chal\u00e1. And that area, as it is lower lying, and cannot pass directly to the other side of the road, would become sedimented and contamination accumulated there. When I lived in Chal\u00e1, we tried to reach an agreement with Chal\u00e1, we tried, with him, to carry out a remediation Project. Unfortunately, 2009 came and we could not execute it. That's how it was\".\n\n246.\n\nWhile the Tribunal accepts Mr. Saltos' representation that the risk of spills is always present in oilfield operations \"no matter how cautious the operator is\", the Tribunal has much more difficulty in accepting his statement that the Consortium had a \"robust spill prevention system\" in place.434 The Tribunal is even less inclined to accept Mr. Saltos' attempts to minimize the importance of certain spills, which he qualified as \"*casi derrames*\" or \"*liqueos*\",435 since the accumulation over time even of minute amounts of certain contaminants can in certain circumstances lead to significant environmental harm if left unremediated. Finally, while Mr. Saltos is right to argue that discharging effluents into a river was not prohibited prior to the entry into force of TULAS on 31 March 2003,436 this practice does not support Burlington's contention that the Consortium was a responsible operator.\n\nSaltos WS1, \u00b6 102. The Spanish version merely refers to the existence of \"un sistema de prevenci\u00f3n de derrames\".\n\nMr. Saltos stated in relevant part: \"These things that are called spills are now not really spills. These are leaks, small leakages. They're not really important volume wise. The ideal thing, of course, would have been not to have leaked even one drop of crude, obviously, but these things are bound to happen in the course of the operations. These operations are carried out by men, and men are always capable of making a mistake\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1215:9-16 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nSaltos WS2, \u00b6 26.\n\n247.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that in Ecuadorian law strict liability governed instances of environmental harm at the latest since the *Delfina Torres* decision was handed down in 2002.437\n\nThe Supreme Court held that: \"We fully agree with this position and such is the reason why we adopt it as foundation for this ruling, in light of the fact that the production, industry, transportation and operation of hydrocarbon substances undoubtedly constitute hazardous or dangerous activities\". *Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador,* \u00b6 20 (**Exh. EL-160**).\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that the *Perenco* tribunal held that fault-based liability governed Ecuador's claims for environmental harm that predates the 2008 Constitution. While the Tribunal agrees with the finding in the *Perenco* Decision that \"an operator can in general be held only to the legal standards that applied to its conduct at the time\",438 it has difficulty following the *Perenco* tribunal's view that decisions of the Ecuadorian courts have merely \"strengthened the presumptions in favour of a finding of liability in the case of damage caused through hazardous activities\".439 It finds indeed that these courts have established a strict liability regime for hazardous activities, in particular oilfield operations.\n\nPerenco v. Ecuador, \u00b6 357.\n\n*Id*., note 881.\n\n249.\n\nIn addition, it is not disputed that Burlington may be held liable for the harm caused by its Consortium partner, Perenco, which operated the Blocks during the Consortium's tenure.440 It is a different issue whether Burlington may be held liable for harm caused by prior operators as Ecuador claims and Burlington opposes, to which the Tribunal will revert after having addressed the limitation period.441\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 228 (\"Regardless of whether strict liability or fault-based liability governs this dispute, Burlington and Perenco can only be held liable for damages that *they have caused*\") (emphasis in the original). See also: Bed\u00f3n ER1, \u00b6 69. Article 2217 CC stipulates as follows: \"If an offence or tort has been committed by two or more persons, each of them shall be jointly and severally liable for any harm arising from such crime or tort, except in the cases set forth in Arts. 2223 and 2228\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. CA-CC-38**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 268-279.\n\n**3.2 Statute of limitations**\n------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nBurlington submits that most of Ecuador's claims are time-barred under the four-year statute of limitations of Article 2235 of the Civil Code,442 which runs from the date when the allegedly harmful act occurred.443 For Burlington, Ecuador is wrong in seeking to import the so-called \"discovery rule\" into the Ecuadorian legal system or to argue that the imprescriptibility rule of the 2008 Constitution could apply retroactively.444 Accordingly, Burlington submits that claims arising out of incidents that occurred before 18 January 2007 are time-barred and inadmissible.445\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 488-487; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 319-334; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 72-74.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 489; Rejoinder, \u00b6 319.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 319.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 489.\n\n251.\n\nEcuador opposes Burlington's argument mainly on the ground that Article 2235 of the Civil Code only governs liability based on fault.446 Claims for strict liability are subject to the limitation set forth in Article 396(4) of the 2008 Constitution, as the Claimant's expert Professor Bed\u00f3n acknowledged at the Hearing.447 Even if Article 2235 of the Civil Code were to apply, says Ecuador, the period would start to run when the harm is discovered, which is after the Consortium abandoned the Blocks in July 2009.448 Ecuador adds that its argumentation is reinforced by Burlington's concealment policy and lack of reporting,449 and that by acquiring its interest in the Blocks, Burlington contractually took over the environmental liabilities of prior operators.450\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 385-401.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 69, referring to: Tr. (Day 2) (ESP), 591:22-592:5 (Cross, Bed\u00f3n), corresponding to Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 570:6-10 (Cross, Bed\u00f3n).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 72.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 765-815.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 71, 636-672.\n\n252.\n\nIt is common ground that environmental claims for harm caused after the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution are imprescriptible. The Parties disagree, however, on the prescriptibility of claims for harm caused prior to the Constitution's entry into force. They diverge on whether such claims are subject to the four-year limitation of Article 2235 of the Civil Code or whether they are imprescriptible.\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by Ecuador's argument that questions related to the statute of limitations are procedural rather than substantive. The approach in *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* in this regard is not convincing, nor is its criterion of the date of the filing of the claim.451 Article 7(20) of the Civil Code is of no help either here, since it leaves unaffected terms that have begun to run prior to a change in law.452 More generally, the Tribunal is of the view that in comparative law and private international law the trend is to consider the statute of limitation as a substantive rather than a procedural issue.453\n\n*Nelson Alc\u00edvar v. OCP,* Corte Provincial de Justicia, 2011, \u00b6 12 (**Andrade ER, Annex 29**) : \"The provisions of the current Constitution as it relates to environmental issues and its protection is also preferably applied, since, in procedural matters, the rules in force at the time of filing the action apply, and not those that were in force when the legal situation was created. In this case, we observe the moment on which the appeal was filed for application of constitutional rules in procedural matters, related to the environmental case, in application of the provisions of Art. 7, point 20 of the Civil Code\".\n\nArticle 7(20) CC reads: \"Laws concerning the substance and procedure of cases prevail over earlier ones from the time they take effect. But the terms that have begun to run and the actions and proceedings that have already begun shall be governed by the law that was in force then\" (**Exh. CA-CC-38**).\n\nIn civil law countries, limitation periods are considered to be substantive in nature. While common law countries traditionally considered limitation periods to be procedural in nature, various countries have progressively shifted away from that traditional approach. See, for instance the Report of the Law Reform Committee \"Limitation Periods in Private International Law\" (Singapore Academy of Law, 2011), \u00b6 2.\n\n254.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is correct that in principle the four-year statute of limitation period provided in Article 2235 CC applies to harm caused prior to the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution, subject to the following specifications.454 The date of the discovery must apply for environmental harm, not the date of the act, since strict liability is focused on the result, not on the act causing the harm. This is so because it is difficult to identify the precise time when environmental harm is generated455 and because, in oilfield operations in Ecuador, the identification of environmental harm is essentially dependent on the operator's self-reporting.456 In the same vein, reliance by Burlington on environmental audits produced by the Consortium as a means to establish constructive knowledge is misplaced here, since (i) environmental audits have no preclusive effect as a general matter under Ecuadorian law,457 and (ii) the Consortium did not generate the required 2004 biennial audits.458 Accordingly, the limitation period only starts to run from the discovery of the harm. The same applies to harm that has been insufficiently remediated, since Ecuador could only assume on the basis of remediation plans and reports submitted by the Consortium that identified harm had been properly remediated. In this context, the notion of \"*pasivo ambiental*\" in Article 1 of the Ministerial Agreement No. 169 (2012), which refers to insufficiently remediated harm, further reinforces the Tribunal's findings above.459\n\nArticle 2235 CC reads: \"Claims that this Title grants for harm or willful wrongdoing have a statute of limitations of four years, counted from the perpetration of the act\" (**Exh. CA-CC-38**).\n\nSee, for instance, Mr. Saltos' statements on the necessity to assume facts due to the difficulty to determine the origin and date of contamination. Saltos WS1, \u00b6 252 (Payamino 2-8), \u00b6 265 (Payamino 14-20-24); Saltos WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 54, 93, 123; Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1279:18-22 (Cross, Saltos). Also, GSI acknowledged at the Hearing that they were providing \"best estimates\" as to when the alleged damage might have occurred. See, for instance, in relation to the workover pit at Payamino 1: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1556:20-21 (Cross, Connor).\n\nSee, for instance: RAOHE, Article 16 (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Article 70 reads as follows: \"The approval of environmental management plans and other environmental studies shall not be used as exonerating evidence in environmental contamination incidents or accidents attributable to any activity, project or construction. The natural or juridical persons, public or private, that represent such activities shall be liable for payment of any applicable damages and penalties\" (**Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0001**). See also: Crespo ER, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98; SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47; 2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. The Block 7 2008 Environmental Audit indicated that it verified the global compliance of the operations with Ecuadorian regulations, but that it could by definition not ensure complete compliance: \"*Por definici\u00f3n, la auditor\u00eda no asegura que se hayan revisado la totalidad de los requisitos establecidos en el marco legal y* *reglamentario y en las pr\u00e1cticas ambientales dentro de la operaci\u00f3n que lleva a cabo PERENCO en el Bloque 7'*. Block 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008, p. 41 (**Exh. E-252**).\n\nSee above, paragraphs 242-243.\n\nArticle 1 contains various principles and definitions relating to the governance of public environmental policies, including a definition of environmental liability (*pasivo ambiental*) which reads as follows: \"These are environmental damages and/or negative environmental impacts not repaired or restored respectively, *or those that have previously been worked on but insufficiently or incompletely and that continue to be present in the environment constituting a risk to any of its components*, which are generated by a work, project or a productive or economic activity in general\" (emphasis added by the Tribunal). Ministerial Agreement No. 169, published in Official Register No. 655 of 7 March 2012 (**Exh. CA-CC-53**). The Tribunal notes that this regulation postdates the initiation of these counterclaims proceedings.\n\n255.\n\nIn sum, (i) environmental harm caused and/or discovered after the entry into force of the October 2008 Constitution is actionable (Articles 396(4) *and* 11(3) Cst.), (ii) environmental harm caused between 17 January 2007 and the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution is actionable, and (iii) environmental harm caused prior to 17 January 2007 is actionable to the extent that it was discovered thereafter (Article 2235 CC read in light of strict liability). This extends to harm that has been insufficiently remediated, since any remaining exceedances were only discovered by IEMS in 2011 or thereafter.\n\n**3.3 Successive liability of operators**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nBurlington rejects Ecuador's attempts to hold it liable for harm caused by prior operators as a matter of tort law (successive tort liability) or pursuant to Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC and Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 PSC (successive contractual liability).460 After addressing the issue of Burlington's liability for the acts of prior operators, the Tribunal will also address the matter of liability for acts of Petroamazonas, the operator that succeeded the Consortium and is presently operating the Blocks.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 268-279.\n\n257.\n\nWith respect to successive tort liability for prior operators, the Tribunal has already held above that causality is a component of strict liability (both under the liability regime of the 2008 Constitution and under the anterior regime elaborated by Ecuadorian courts), although it is presumed. Accordingly, to be exonerated, Burlington must prove that any alleged harm was caused by *force majeure*, the victim, or a third party. In other words, under the strict liability regime, Burlington cannot be held liable for harm which it can prove to have been caused by prior operators.\n\n258.\n\nThe situation is different under the PSCs. As was seen above, Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC excludes the Consortium's liability for environmental harm caused prior to the first service contract, i.e., prior to January 1986 and after return of the contract area, i.e. in July 2009.461 A similar provision is found in the Block 21 PSC, with the difference that the starting point for the Consortium's liability is set at the conclusion of the first participation contract in 1995.462 Within these time spans, the Consortium is under a contractual obligation to remediate any environmental harm caused by prior operators.\n\nClause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC reads in relevant part: \"The Contractor shall not be liable for environmental conditions preexisting at the beginning of operations under the Services Contract. [\u2026] The Contractor shall also not be liable for those environmental conditions which are the consequence of operations performed by PETROECUADOR or third parties after the Contractor has returned the Contract Area\". Clause 2.1 of the Block 7 PSC specifies that the Services Contract was concluded on 18 December 1985, effective as of 17 January 1986 when it was inscribed in the National Hydrocarbons Directorate (**Exh. CE-CC-28**).\n\nBlock 21 Participation Contract, Clause 5.1.20 (**Exh. CE-CC-13**). The Block 21 PSC was first executed on 20 March 1995.\n\n259.\n\nThe question is thus whether the Tribunal should apply this contractual obligation for harm caused by prior operators in the present context. Ecuador's position has somewhat fluctuated on this issue.463 At the Hearing, it sought to clarify matters as follows: \"Now, our case, Members of the Tribunal \u2013 and we don't want you to have any confusion about it \u2013 our case is not based upon any contractual liability, but rather of a tort liability\".464 In spite of this clear statement, Ecuador sought relief in reliance on the Constitution and the PSCs465 and one part of its oral presentation focused on the construction of the PSC provisions on successive operators.466 On a question from the Tribunal, Ecuador further explained that \"the basis for Ecuador's claim is principally the 2008 Constitution tort liability principles; and [\u2026] tentatively the Contract would apply, if you don't find that a [sic] tort liability principles apply here. Second point, is that, even if you have, as the main case of Ecuador, these tort liability principles encompassed in the 2008 Constitution, it is our position [\u2026] that there are some contractual provisions that have a bearing on the issue of causation, which you understood especially in this scenario of succession of operators [\u2026]\".467 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Ecuador then invoked strict liability and stated that, in addition, the obligation to fully restore the Blocks also arises from the PSCs468 and the transfers authorized by the Ministry,469 which obligation extends to the CPUF.470\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on Liability, Ecuador mainly relied on Ecuadorian tort law to invoke Burlington's liability. It mentioned the PSCs \"*ex abundanti cautela*\" and stated that \"[b]ecause Ecuadorian law recognizes the principle of strict liability for environmental damages caused by hydrocarbons operations, there is no need to consider separately whether, in addition, Burlington could be contractually liable to Ecuador for that same environmental damage under the Participation Contracts [\u2026]\" (Counter-Memorial on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 760-761). Ecuador did not invoke the PSCs in relation to the environmental counterclaim in its Supplemental Memorials on Counterclaims. In its Reply, however, Ecuador referred to the PSCs to extend the temporal scope of the strict liability regime (Reply, \u00b6 430).\n\nTr. (Day 1) (ENG), 27:12-15 (Opening, Silva Romero).\n\nTr.

CE-CC-8**).\n\n260.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal understands that (i) Ecuador's environmental counterclaim is a strict liability claim in tort and that (ii) Ecuador refers to the PSCs first, to provide principles of liability in the event that such principles are lacking in the legal framework governing strict liability and, second to regulate causation in respect of other operators in the field.\n\n261.\n\nFor its part, Burlington regards this counterclaim as one based exclusively on tort law.471 It also considers that the outcome under the PSCs would be no different, as \"the PSCs exonerate Burlington from liability for harm caused by others\".472 Before proceeding further, the Tribunal notes that the outcome would, however, be different, as the contractual liability starts to accrue from the first contracts for the Blocks and not from the beginning of the Consortium's operations, as is shown by Clause 2.1 in conjunction with Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC and by Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 PSC.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 67. See also: Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 52-55, 241-244.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 67.\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that resort to the PSCs is well-founded here. The 2008 Constitution and Ecuadorian case law provide the relevant tort liability principles, as established above, and there is no basis to import liability principles from the PSCs. As regards the contractual rules on successive liability of operators more specifically, Ecuador has not convincingly explained why the Tribunal would need to apply such contract rules to a tort claim in derogation from the tort liability rules contained in the 2008 Constitution and case law. The same reasoning applies to Ecuador's argument in respect to the successive transfers of the prior contractor's obligation to restore the Blocks which were authorized by the Ministry of Mines and Energy.473 While Ecuador characterizes these transfers as a \"parallel source of Burlington's obligation to fully restore the environment in Blocks 7 and 21\",474 it has not sufficiently substantiated that this obligation must take precedence over the general tort liability regime discussed above.\n\nSee references in note 469 above.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 673.\n\n263.\n\nEcuador has also relied on Article 2217 of the Civil Code to argue that, where harm is attributable to several authors, each one is liable for the full amount.475 There is no need to dwell on the rather obvious point that this rule concerns a situation in which several actors create the same harm; it does not govern a situation in which an operator which has not caused the harm may, by operation of law or contract, be liable for the harm caused by another.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 417, referring to: Andrade ER, \u00b6\u00b6 72-79. See also: Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 418-429.\n\n264.\n\nAccordingly, Burlington can only be held liable in these proceedings for harm caused by the Consortium. In other words, Burlington can avoid liability if it shows that the alleged harm was caused by prior operators. This conclusion is nuanced to take account of the possibility that pre-existing environmental harm may have continued to expand or disperse as a result of the Consortium's breach of its duty to monitor the environmental conditions in the Blocks and remediate any exceedances, as well as for the possibility that the Consortium increased the environmental liabilities of an already contaminated site. In either case, such harm could properly be said to have been at least partially caused by the Consortium.\n\n265.\n\nIn application of the principles of causation discussed above, the Consortium cannot either be held liable for harm caused by Petroamazonas, the operator that took over the oilfields in 2009 and expanded operations since then. The Tribunal, however, rejects Burlington's argument that the Consortium bears no liability for the environmental conditions of the Blocks simply by virtue of the fact that Petroamazonas took over the Consortium's rights and obligations by substituting itself to the Consortium.\n\n266.\n\nHaving set out the key components of the strict liability regimes, the Tribunal will now address the Parties' positions and set out the Tribunal's approach regarding soil contamination (Section 4), mud pits (Section 5) and groundwater contamination (Section 6). Finally, the Tribunal will address the issue of well site abandonment (Section 7).\n\n**4. Soil contamination**\n-------------------------\n\n267.\n\nWith respect to soil contamination, the Tribunal will start by addressing the notion of environmental harm (4.1), followed by general considerations on permissible limits (4.2), land use criteria (4.3), as well as guidelines to calculate impacted areas and volumes of impacted soils (4.4) and the remediation costs (4.5). This will then allow the Tribunal to outline its approach to assessing the environmental conditions in the Blocks and engage in a site-specific analysis (4.6).\n\n**4.1 The notion of environmental harm**\n----------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the definition of environmental harm. The opposition hinges on whether environmental harm is defined by reference to \"permissible limits\" set out in applicable regulations (as argued by Burlington) or to \"background values\" that reflect environmental conditions as they were prior to any human interference (as argued by Ecuador);476 and, if the permissible limits approach is adopted, whether the relevant limits are those applicable to industrial or agricultural land use (as argued by Burlington) or to sensitive ecosystems (as argued by Ecuador in the alternative).\n\nMr. Alfaro defined background values as follows: \"The concept of background value [\u2026] entails the conditions of the facilities without or prior to the hydrocarbons operation\". Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 660:15-18 (Direct, Alfaro).\n\n269.\n\nThe consequences of adopting one or the other of these positions are significant in terms of the monetary relief for soil remediation claimed by Ecuador. Indeed, Ecuador's primary case is for soil remediation of any environmental harm in the Blocks back to background values, for which it claims USD 2,507,107,626 (the \"background values case\"). In the alternative, Ecuador claims soil remediation back to the sensitive ecosystems criteria, i.e. the most protective land use standards under RAOHE Table 6, in the amount of USD 790,465,298 (the \"regulatory criteria case\"). The Tribunal will therefore first assess the merits of Ecuador's argument that background values should apply as a general matter, and it will only address Ecuador's alternative case if its background values case is ill-founded.\n\n**4.1.1 Parties' positions**\n----------------------------\n\n270.\n\nIn support of the background values case, Ecuador essentially argues that the notion of environmental harm under the 2008 Constitution and the EML is distinct from the notion of regulatory permissible limits enshrined in RAOHE and TULAS.477 For Ecuador, the Tribunal must determine environmental harm by examining whether there is a \"negative impact\" of any sort on the environment, that is, whether the alleged alteration affects \"the functions of the environment or the renewability of the resources\" in accordance with the EML.478 The Consortium, Ecuador states, had no right to pollute up to regulatory permissible limits and it must repair all harm found in the Blocks so as to restore the environment \"to its original \u2018*background*' condition\".479 This must be so, according to Ecuador, because (i) Burlington's permissible limits theory is contrary to the Constitution's aim of full restoration,480 (ii) the notion of environmental harm is not defined in RAOHE and TULAS,481 which are mere instruments (iii) aimed at regulating the activities of oil operators,482 (iv) and at operating as risk management tools,483 which (v) govern administrative liability, not civil liability for harm.484 In the end, Ecuador argues that (vi) the significance of a \"negative impact\" can only be assessed on the specific facts of each case and environmental harm \"cannot *per se* be defined through quality standards or permissible limits\",485 in particular because RAOHE and TULAS do not differentiate the \"types and characteristics of lands (deserts, forest, rainforest, mountains, islands\u2026)\".486\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 81-150.\n\nTr.

The 2010 Ex-Post Studies also evaluated the environmental condition of the Blocks under regulatory criteria.493 In addition, Burlington argues that IEMS applied a flawed methodology for calculating background values of metals resulting in 84 percent of IEMS's clean samples being deemed contaminated.494 In the end, Burlington submits that\n\n\"[r]emediation must be limited to those soils that exceed Ecuador's protective regulatory limits\", and therefore Ecuador's background case should be dismissed in its entirety.495\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 98.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 8, 79, 99.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 104; Tr.

Environmental harm under Ecuadorian law**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal starts its analysis by noting that neither the 2008 Constitution, nor RAOHE or TULAS contain a definition of environmental harm. Paragraph 2 of Article 396 of the Constitution provides that any environmental harm triggers the duty to fully restore the affected ecosystem. It reads in relevant part:\n\n\"All damage to the environment, in addition to the respective penalties, shall also entail the obligation of integrally restoring the ecosystems and compensating the affected persons and communities\".496\n\nArticle 396(2), 2nd sentence of the 2008 Constitution (**Exh. C-413**) (Translation by the Claimant). The translation provided by Ecuador reads as follows: \"Any harm to the environment, in addition to the corresponding sanctions, shall also give rise to an obligation to fully restore the ecosystems and compensate the individuals and communities affected\" (**Exh. P-12**).\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that Article 71 of the Constitution states that nature has the \"right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes\", and Article 72 provides for nature's \"right to be restored\". This latter provision further stipulates that in cases of \"severe or permanent environmental impact\" caused *inter alia* by the exploitation of nonrenewable resources, \"the State shall establish the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences\".497\n\nThe Tribunal notes Ecuador's representation that Article 72 \"only pertains to environmental disasters, such as Chernobyl, where the State has a duty to intervene without awaiting the operator's actions\". R-PHB, \u00b6 105.\n\n275.\n\nArticle 397 further states that, in case of environmental harm, the State is to act immediately to ensure the restoration of affected ecosystems, and that, in addition to sanctions, \"the State shall file against the operator of the activity that produced the damage proceedings for the obligations entailing integral reparation, under the conditions and on the basis of the procedures provided for by law\".498 Thus, under the 2008 Constitution, any environmental harm triggers the duty of full restoration but *under the conditions and on the basis provided for by law*. The concept of integral or full restoration has been addressed in various instances. The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the 2008 Constitution indicate, for example, that full restoration means returning things to their original state (\"*volver las cosas a su estado original o a su lugar\"*).499 And in *Aguinda*, the National Court of Justice held that integral reparation served to achieve the ultimate finality of \"global restoration of environmental goods\".500 In sum, the Constitution does not define environmental harm, but states that such harm must be fully restored according to the conditions set out in the law. The Tribunal therefore finds no support for Ecuador's argument that the notion of full reparation or full restoration under the 2008 Constitution mandates a return to pre-human conditions or, as Ecuador puts it, the return to a state of the environment \"prior to any form of contamination\".501 In the end, Ecuador's reliance on the notion of full restoration sheds no light on the notion of environmental harm. The question remains whether relying on permissible limits to define environmental harm would be contrary to the 2008 Constitution as Ecuador contends.502\n\nArticle 397 (**Exh. C-413**) (Translation by the Claimant). The translation provided by Ecuador reads as follows: \"In the event of environmental harm, the State shall act immediately and subsidiarily to ensure the health and the restoration of the ecosystems. In addition to the corresponding sanction, the State shall seek restitution from the operator of the activity that produced the harm for the obligations entailed by full reparation, under the conditions and on the basis of procedures established by law\" (**Exh. P-12**).\n\nMinority Report of the Assembly member Sergio Chac\u00f3n Padilla on the rights of Nature (**Exh. El-230**) ; Majority Report on the rights of Nature (**Exh. EL-231**). The Ministerial Agreement No. 169 (2012) defines \"integral restoration\" and \"integral reparation\". Integral restoration, as a right of nature, is defined in relevant part as a return \"to the conditions set forth by the environmental authority that ensure the reestablishment of natural balances, cycles and function\". Integral reparation is defined in relevant part as the \"[s]et of actions, processes and measures that, when comprehensively applied, tend toward reverting environmental damage and liabilities through the reestablishment of the quality, dynamics, ecological balance, life cycles, structure, functioning and evolutionary process of the affected ecosystems\". Ministerial Agreement No. 169 (2012), published in Official Register No. 655 of 7 March 2012, Article 1 (**Exh. CA-CC-53**).\n\n*Aguinda v. Chevron,* p. 141 (**Exh. EL-233**).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 96.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 83.\n\n276.\n\nThe notion of environmental harm is defined in the glossary of the EML, which also contains definitions of the terms contamination and environmental impact.503 Environmental harm is defined as:\n\n\"any significant loss, decrease, detriment or impairment to the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources\".504\n\nContamination is defined as: \"\"The presence in the environment of substances, elements, energy or a combination thereof, the concentration and permanence of which are higher or lower than those prescribed by the laws in force\". Environmental impact is defined as: \"The positive or negative alteration of the environment, caused directly or otherwise by a project or activity in a given area\" (Translations by the Tribunal) (**Exh. CA-CC-33**).\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. A similar definition is provided in Article 1 of Ministerial Decree No. 169: \"Environmental harm: It is the negative environmental impact on the environmental conditions present in a given space, caused by the conduct of development projects, leading to an imbalance in the functioning of ecosystems and altering the supply of the services that such ecosystems contribute to society\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. El-228**).\n\n277.\n\nAccordingly, environmental harm is more than a mere \"negative impact\" (as argued by Ecuador), it implies a *significant* loss or impairment. Ecuador's definition also fails to capture *de minimis* or socially and environmentally tolerable impacts, that is, as IEMS puts it, impacts which do not \"significantly [affect] human health or the environment\".505 The second sentence of the EML definition provides some criteria for determining when an environmental impact is \"significant\" and thus constitutes environmental harm, namely when it \"affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources\".\n\nEcuador's experts from IEMS explained in their first expert report that the \"need to use comparison criteria is based on the fact that, on properties that are used for productive purposes related with petroleum activities, we tolerate certain concentrations of contaminants without altering its functions, and without significantly affecting human health and the environment. Furthermore, the presence of contaminants resulting regularly from petroleum activities, in tolerable quantities and concentrations, represents a [sic] alteration of little relevance compared with the other alterations caused by the same productive activity (deforestation, noise, modification of the hydrological environment, etc.). Therefore, the comparison criteria (which, in this case in particular, consist in the permissible limits set forth in the Ecuadorian legislation), make it possible to establish whether the presence of contaminants at certain levels and components of the environment (soil, surface water, and underground water) is tolerable\". IEMS ER1, p. 20.\n\n278.\n\nNeither Party has put much emphasis on the second sentence in the definition. Burlington has tendered evidence showing that the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS pose no risk to human health,506 but has not otherwise sought to demonstrate that compliance with these standards is sufficiently protective to ensure the ecosystem's functioning and the renewability of its resources. For its part, Ecuador has offered a preliminary analysis of certain macro-invertebrates,507 but has otherwise not provided an ecological risk assessment or any other analysis of possible impacts of the Consortium's operations on the ecosystem of the allegedly contaminated sites. The Tribunal will thus form its opinion on the background values case on the basis of other elements in the record.\n\nGSI ER1, App. E (Evaluation of Potential Human Health Risks Associated with Environmental Conditions).\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 25.\n\n279.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that the EML not only provides a definition of environmental harm, it also refers to permissible limits. Article 1 states that the EML establishes principles and guidelines of environmental policy, determines obligations and responsibilities, and \"indicates the permissible limits, controls and sanctions in this matter\". Moreover, Article 33 stipulates that \"environmental quality parameters\" shall be established as \"instruments for the application of environmental norms\", which shall be \"governed by the respective regulation\".508 This provision tends to support the proposition that RAOHE and TULAS refine and implement the general provisions of the EML.\n\nArticle 33 EML reads as follows: \"The following shall be established as instruments for the application of environmental norms: environmental quality parameters, rules on effluents and emissions, technical rules on product quality, system of administrative permits and licenses, environmental impact assessments, lists of contaminating products harmful to human health and the environment, environmental quality certification of products, services and others to be *governed by the respective regulation\"* (emphasis and translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. CA-CC-** **33**).\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Ecuador's adoption in 1999 of the definition of environmental harm in the EML, was followed shortly thereafter by revisions to the permissible limits in RAOHE in 2001 and by the adoption of limits in TULAS in 2003. It is also particularly noteworthy that the definition of environmental harm under the EML, as well as the permissible limits under RAOHE and TULAS, remained unchanged following the adoption of the 2008 Constitution.\n\n281.\n\nIt is also relevant that RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3 apply specifically to soil contamination and remediation. RAOHE Table 6 is entitled \"Permissible limits for the identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbons industry\". In this context, it is noteworthy that the glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines permissible limits as the \"maximum value of concentration of element(s) or substance(s) in the different components of the environment, *determined through standardized methods, and regulated through legal instrument*\".509 Article 4.2.2 of TULAS which comprises TULAS Table 3 is similarly entitled \"Soil Remediation or Restoration Criteria\", further specifying that the values in Table 3 aim at \"establish[ing] the maximum contaminant concentration levels for soil in the process of remediation or restoration\".510\n\nTranslation and emphasis added by the Tribunal. RAOHE, Annex 6, Glossary (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\nTULAS, Article 4.2.2 (**Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0009**).\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the constitutional duty of full or integral restoration is not in all cases necessarily exhausted by referring to permissible limits under RAOHE and TULAS, but it cannot agree with Ecuador's position that remediating back to permissible limits for the relevant parameters set out in these regulations would be unconstitutional.\n\n283.\n\nHarm to the environment could indeed be caused in a myriad of different ways, but in the Tribunal's view, when it comes to allegations of soil contamination by one of the parameters set out in RAOHE Table 6, then the dividing line between impact and harm (or between *impacto ambiental* and *da\u00f1o ambiental*) is encapsulated in the very notion of permissible limits.\n\n**b. The subsidiary nature of background values**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nIt is only when there is soil contamination by an element not contemplated in RAOHE Table 6, such as for instance barium or arsenic, that recourse must be had to supplementary means such as TULAS, which contains permissible limits for additional parameters, and otherwise enshrines rules prescribing recourse to background values as a subsidiary means to determine the proper remediation standard. Of particular relevance in cases of soil contamination is Article 4.1.3.3 of TULAS, which specifically contemplates having recourse to background values only in the absence of a parameter in TULAS or in case of inapplicability of a certain parameter:\n\n\"In case of the inapplicability for the specific case of any parameter established in the present regulation, or in case of the absence in the regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil under study, the Environmental Control Entity shall adopt the following evaluation criteria:\n\nThe regulated entity must establish the background or reference value of the parameter of interest present in the soil. The regulated entity shall determine the present or current concentration of the parameter under study in the affected area. It shall then proceed to compare the obtained results for the concentration present in the soil against the background values. In general, it is considered that a present concentration greater than three times the background value for the soil denotes contamination that requires immediate attention on the part of the Environmental Control Entity\".511\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Article 4.1.3.3 (**Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0006**). A similar rule relating to marine water discharges can be found in Article 4.2.3.10 of Book VI, Annex I of TULAS.\n\n285.\n\nAccordingly, recourse to background values is subsidiary and only permitted in two cases, namely when a specific parameter is inapplicable or the absence of a relevant parameter, an issue to which the Tribunal will revert further below. In contrast to the regime established in RAOHE, TULAS further differentiates between screening criteria and remediation criteria by stating that any concentrations exceeding three times the mean background value (screening criteria or action level) must be remediated back to 1.5 times the background value (remediation criteria).\n\n\"If the concentration is found to be three times higher than the background value, the Environmental Control Entity shall give immediate attention to this situation and must obl\u00edgate the regulated entity to remediate the soil until the present concentration is less than or equal to 1.5 times the background value\".512\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Article 4.1.3.3 (**Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0006**).\n\n286.\n\nThis provision not only demonstrates the subsidiary or residual nature of recourse to background values to determine remediation criteria, but also puts to rest Ecuador's thesis that Burlington must remediate any alleged harm back to background values, since any remediation would *ex hypotesi* be limited to reducing any contamination present in soils to 1.5 times the mean background value of the relevant parameter. In sum, in addition to the fact that Ecuador has not pointed to a specific provision in its legal order which would mandate having recourse to background values as remediation criteria, the existing references to background values in Ecuadorian law have a much more limited scope of application than suggested by Ecuador.513\n\nFor instance, Table 2 in TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2 sets out soil quality criteria, which are defined in Article 4.2.1 as \"approximate background values or analytic detection limits\" serving as representative environmental values of a contaminant in the soil reflecting natural geological variations in non-developed areas or areas free of industrial or urban activities. Accordingly, Table 2 only sets out approximate background values, but does not spell out remediation criteria or otherwise provide any insight into what amounts to environmental harm under Ecuadorian law.\n\n287.\n\nTwo further considerations are of relevance here, namely the actual practice in Ecuador when it comes to the remediation of environmental harm and the methodology initially adopted by Ecuador's experts from IEMS. With respect to actual practice, the Tribunal notes that Ecuador has not provided a single example where background values have been applied in practice. All remediation reports in the record show that instances of contamination were remediated back to permissible limits as specified in RAOHE and TULAS, be that before or after the promulgation of the 2008 Constitution.514 The *Los* *Vencedores* case is particularly apposite here since it deals with a 12-barrel crude spill that occurred in Block 7 on 11 June 2009 when the Consortium was still operating the Blocks. The court in that case repeatedly referred to permissible limits in RAOHE Table 6 and ultimately found that Perenco had properly remediated the spill within those permissible limits.515 The same can be said of the environmental audits in the record, whether commissioned by the Consortium or by Petroamazonas, which identify environmental conditions by reference to permissible limits.516 Interestingly, the court in *Los Vencedores* also referred to numeral 11 of Article 1 of the preliminary title of TULAS (which was not added to the record by Ecuador), which expressly refers to permissible limits and indicates that the duty to repair and restore the environment arises once these limits are exceeded.517\n\nFor practice in the Blocks during the Consortium's operatorship see, for instance: Letter of 28 January 2003 from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to Edgar L\u00f3pez (DINAPA) attaching the Remediation Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino field, p. 4 (**Exh. cE-CC-51**) (\"The objective of remediation is to decrease the concentration of contaminants to minimal levels specified in the \u2018Industrial Use' column in Table 6 of the Environmental Regulation\" (Translation by the Tribunal)); Letter of 13 June 2003 from Vicente Inepa (Ministry of Energy and Mines) to Luis Cobos (Perenco), approving the Block 7/CPUF remediation plan (**Exh.

Numeral 11 of Article 1 of the preliminary title of TULAS reads in relevant part: \"Without prejudice to addressing environmental issues as a whole, including related legal regulations, special priority shall be given to prevention and control, so as to prevent environmental damage resulting from degradation of the environment and contamination, making sure that permits are obtained in advance, that tolerance limits for each substance are established, and that the State monitors and controls all activities that are potentially degrading and/or contaminating. Degradation and contamination as illegal acts (*once the permissible limits are exceeded*) shall be grounds for penalizing infringers *and imposing on them the obligation to repair the damage caused and restore the environment or natural resource affected*\" (emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n288.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the 32 Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental Management Plans issued since 2001 for both Blocks (that is, after Decree 1215 was enacted) and reviewed by GSI show that RAOHE and TULAS were consistently referred to as the applicable regulations.518 GSI further pointed to 20 remediation projects undertaken in other Blocks in the Oriente region, all of which applied regulatory criteria under RAOHE Table 6 and none requiring remediation back to background levels.519\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.1. See also: GSI ER1, p. 39. The Tribunal notes that Appendix B.1 contains a list of 52 Environmental Impact Studies and Environmental Management Plans spanning from February 1991 to September 2011, and of which 21 were generated by the Consortium. Of those generated by the Consortium, 5 do not specify what regulatory criteria are used for soil quality; 4 refer only to RAOHE Table 6; 1 only to TULAS Table 2; 8 to RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 2; 2 to RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3; and 1 to RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Tables 2 and 3.\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.2. See also: GSI ER1, pp. 39-40.\n\n289.\n\nOf further relevance is the fact that Ecuador's own expert IEMS initially sought to determine the environmental conditions of the Blocks by reference to the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS,520 before being instructed by Ecuador to apply background values on the grounds that permissible limits were not sufficiently protective of the environment.521 Ecuador admitted at the Hearing that it instructed IEMS to apply background values522 and explained that IEMS employed permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS during its first sampling campaign \"for the sake of information only\", since IEMS did not yet have the reference background values at its disposal.523 IEMS moreover opined that Ecuadorian benchmarks are \"arbitrary\" and \"not sufficiently protective of the health of the people who live in the area\".524\n\nIEMS ER1, p. 25.\n\nTr. (Day 3) (ENG), 710:20-711:5, 711:20-712:5 (Cross, Alfaro). IEMS put it in the following terms: \"We received instructions to apply a criterion that would be compatible with the restoration back to original conditions. And to us that, that meant background levels\".\n\nTr. (Day 1) (ENG), 47:15-20 (Opening, Silva Romero). Counsel for Ecuador stated the following: \"Ecuador fails to see how in this case it could be disputed that all environmental harm should be repaired so as to restore the site to its original, natural condition, and this is the reason why IEMS, the technical experts of Ecuador, were instructed to employ \u2018background values'\".\n\nSMCC, note 145. Ecuador indicated that: \"For the sake of information only, IEMS analyzed the collected soil samples in accordance with the parameters set forth in the Ecuadorian regulations (RAOHE and TULAS). Nevertheless, it stresses that the correct criteria to be applied in order to guarantee the full reparation of the damage [\u2026] are the real Reference Values. At the time of its first report, IEMS did not have the Reference Values yet, reason why it applied the criteria provided in the regulations for comparative purposes\".\n\nIEMS ER3, p. 38.\n\n290.\n\nWhatever the merits of these explanations, it remains that IEMS chose to use regulatory limits in its first report and then shifted to background values under the pretext that, in its expert opinion, the regulations were not protective enough, but in reality because it was instructed to do so.525 As to Ecuador's argument that its own regulatory limits are not sufficiently protective of the environment or human health, the Tribunal observes that Ecuador set the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS further to the adoption of the EML, that it did not amend these limits following the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution, and that it is not for the Tribunal to modify Ecuador's duly enacted regulatory framework in place of the competent authorities. The same applies to Ecuador's argument that its regulations are deficient since they do not differentiate between various ecosystems in Ecuador, and that the Amazon region should find particular protection. As already noted above, the 2008 Constitution makes special reference to the Amazon region and this element will be of some relevance when it comes to determining the applicable land use, but here again it falls within the remit of the Ecuadorian authorities to set different criteria for the Amazon region, if they so wish; it is not for this Tribunal to do so.\n\nFor instance, in its third expert report, IEMS stated that \"[i]n this case, to determine whether a site was contaminated, the comparison criterion that was considered, *according to our technical opinion*, was the concentrations of the substance in question that were found in a natural state in areas not affected by hydrocarbon activity (called \u2018background levels' or \u2018benchmarks'); if background levels are exceeded, it has been shown that the operations conducted had a negative impact on the environment, that is, that there had been an alteration of the natural state, which should be restored\". IEMS added that \"*[i]n the opinion of an IEMS expert*, the benchmarks stipulated in Ecuadorian law [\u2026] should not be used generally to determine liability [because] [t]he allowable limits established in [TULAS] do not appear to be based on criteria aimed at the protection of the health of the ecosystem or persons who reside in the impacted area and, therefore, the effectiveness of such limits appears to be limited. The amounts expressed in the regulations appear to be defined in a manner better characterized as arbitrary\" and \"[ *i]n the opinion of the IEMS expert* [\u2026], the obligation to conduct cleanup and/or environmental restoration operations should be based on benchmark concentrations obtained through evaluations of the risk to human health and the environment\") (emphasis added). IEMS ER3, pp. 36-38.\n\n291.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, it is the Tribunal's view that environmental harm is defined by reference to regulatory criteria. In the case of oilfield operations, these regulatory criteria are to be found primarily in RAOHE, and subsidiarily in TULAS. In other words, an oilfield operator could not be considered to have caused environmental harm if permissible limits were observed, since precisely these permissible limits allow determining when a negative impact crosses the threshold of harm.\n\n292.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will resort to RAOHE and TULAS to define harm under the EML. Hence, the limits set out in these regulations establish when impacts become significant, and thereby become harm, thus allowing the inference that these limits determine when the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources are affected.526 In other words, any exceedance of applicable limits triggers extracontractual civil liability and the ensuing obligation of full restoration back to these limits, independently from parallel administrative liability and possible sanctions.\n\nSee IEMS's statement that \"we tolerate certain concentrations of contaminants without altering its [i.e., the environment's] functions, and without significantly affecting human health and the environment\". IEMS ER1, p. 20.\n\n293.\n\nHaving rejected Ecuador's background values case, the Tribunal will now assess the regulatory criteria cases presented by the Parties respectively, starting with the applicable permissible limits for soil remediation and thereafter setting out the applicable land use criteria. Following its analysis for soil remediation, the Tribunal will address the applicable regulatory framework for mud pits and for the alleged groundwater contamination.\n\n**4.2 Permissible limits for soil remediation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nTurning to Ecuador's alternative case for soil remediation based on regulatory criteria, the Tribunal must now determine which standards apply to the allegedly impacted areas in the Blocks. The Parties agree that under the regulatory criteria scenario, RAOHE Table 6 applies for soil remediation, but they disagree whether the values in that table must be adjusted to higher natural values and, if so, what the proper values should be (4.2.2). They further disagree whether TULAS Table 2 (as Ecuador contends) or Table 3 (as Burlington contends) applies for parameters not contemplated in RAOHE Table 6 (4.2.1).527\n\nEcuador's experts from IEMS indicated that \"[s]ince at this point, there is no remediation taking place, it is not clear that Table 3 levels can be asserted proactively as a maximum contaminant level\". IEMS ER4, p. 43.\n\n**4.2.1 Applicable table under TULAS for soil remediation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nTULAS Table 2, entitled \"soil quality criteria\", is part of Article 4.2.1 and sets out soil quality criteria for different \"parameters\" or substances. Article 4.2.1 defines soil quality criteria as \"approximate background values or analytical detection limits for a contaminant in the soil\". It further provides that background values \"refer to the representative environmental levels for a contaminant in the soil\" and that these values \"reflect the natural geological variations of undeveloped areas or areas free of the influence of generalized industrial or urban activities\". In other words, Table 2 only provides for approximate background values reflecting natural variations in undeveloped areas. By contrast, Table 3 is entitled \"Soil Remediation or Restoration Criteria\" and sets forth the \"maximum contaminant concentration levels for soil in the process of remediation or restoration\". In light of the subject matter of the two tables, Table 3 is the proper source for soil contamination parameters not contemplated in RAOHE Table 6.\n\n**4.2.2 Adjustment to higher natural values**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the need to adjust the permissible limits to account for higher natural values. After setting out the adjusted values adopted by the Parties as well as the justifications provided by the Parties (Section a), the Tribunal will address the methodologies adopted by the Parties to calculate their adjusted values and then establish the adjusted values applicable to the present case (Section b).\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Parties adjusted the permissible limits of various compounds to take into account higher natural concentrations in the soils, but reached different conclusions in great part because they applied different methodologies. The Tribunal will first set out the adjusted values adopted by the Parties ((i) below) and then the justifications provided by the Parties ((ii) below).\n\n(i) *The adjusted values adopted by the Parties*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nEcuador's expert IEMS collected 192 soil samples in areas not impacted by oilfield operations to calculate the natural concentrations of (i) cadmium, nickel and lead, which are regulated under RAOHE Table 6;528 and (ii) barium and vanadium, which are regulated under TULAS Table 3.529 In addition to making its own calculations for the values of these compounds, Burlington's expert GSI also calculated the natural value for chromium in Block 7 but not Block 21.530 As a result, each Party adopted the higher values which it had reached as remediation criteria for barium, cadmium, lead, nickel and vanadium.531 The relevant values adopted by the Parties are the following:532\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Chemical | IEMS Soil Criteria (mg/Kg) | GSI Soil Criteria (mg/kg) |\n| IEMS \"Background\" Criteria | IEMS \"Regulatory\" Criteria | Applicable Rule | Industrial | Agricultural | Sensitive Ecosystem | Residential |\n| *\\CPUF/Block 7* |\n| Barium | 213.1 | 639.3 | TULAS | 2000 | 750 | - | 706 |\n| Cadmium | 2 | 1 9967 | RAOH | 10 | 3.8 | 3.8 | - |\n| Chromium | - | 60 | TULAS | 90 | 65 | - | 65 |\n| Lead | 1841 | 80 | RAOH | 500 | 100 | 80 | - |\n| Nickel | 14.41 | 40 | RAOH | 100 | 50 | 40 | - |\n| Vanadium | 106.71 | 320.75 | TULAS | 311 | 311 | - | 311 |\n| TPH | - | 1000 | RAOH | 4000 | 2500 | 1000 | - |\n| *Block 21* |\n| Barium | 113.93 | 600 | TULAS | 2000 | 750 | - | 500 |\n| Cadmium | 1,775 | 1,775 | RAOH | 10 | 2 | 2 | - |\n| Chromium | - | 60 | TULAS | 90 | 65 | - | 65 |\n| Lead | 1841 | 80 | RAOH | 500 | 100 | 30 | - |\n| Nickel | 34.13 | 40 | RAOH | 100 | 50 | 47 | - |\n| Vanadium | 62.31 | 186.93 | TULAS | 130 | 130 | - | 130 |\n| TPH | - | 1000 | RAOH | 4000 | 2500 | 1000 | - |\n\nEcuador set the background value for TPH at zero.\n\nIEMS also tested for pH and electrical conductivity but Ecuador raised no claim with respect to these two parameters. IEMS ER4, p. 15. See also: IEMS ER4, Att. 4; IEMS ER3, Section IV.1.A, Annex L.4 and Annex Y.\n\nGSI ER1, Att. I, p. I.6.\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 44.\n\nFor Ecuador, see: IEMS ER4, p. 44, Table 1; RPS ER2, Table 3-2, p. 21. For Burlington, see: GSI ER2, Table 6.\n\n299.\n\nAccordingly, with respect to Block 7/CPUF, the Parties agree that RAOHE Table 6 be adjusted for cadmium, not for lead and nickel, but disagree on the adjusted value and the relevant land use. Ecuador argues that the cadmium value be adjusted to 2 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystems, whereas Burlington argues that the cadmium value be adjusted to 3.8 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystem as well as agricultural use. And with respect to compounds regulated under TULAS, the Parties agree that TULAS Table 3 be adjusted for barium and vanadium, and not for chromium. They disagree, however, on the adjusted values. Ecuador argues that the barium value for sensitive ecosystem land use should be increased from 500 mg/kg to 639 mg/kg, whereas Burlington argues for an increase to 706 mg/kg. With respect to vanadium, Ecuador's adjusted value of 320.75 mg/kg is higher than Burlington's adjusted value of 311 mg/kg.\n\n300.\n\nWith respect to Block 21, the Parties disagree on the adjusted value for cadmium for sensitive ecosystems, Ecuador arguing for an increase to 1.77 mg/kg and Burlington to 2 mg/kg. They further disagree on whether the value for nickel for sensitive ecosystems should be adjusted, Burlington arguing that the value for nickel should be increased from 40 mg/kg to 47 mg/kg. In addition, Ecuador calculated the background value for barium at 133 mg/kg and the remediation criteria at 600 mg/kg, while Burlington provided no adjusted value for barium. Finally, Ecuador proposed an adjusted value of 186 mg/kg for vanadium, while Burlington did not adjust the vanadium limit.\n\n(ii) *Justifications*\n---------------------\n\n301.\n\nIn general terms, the disagreement between the Parties on adjusting regulatory criteria to reflect higher natural concentrations in the soils essentially turns on when a specific TULAS parameter is inapplicable and, when it is, whether the adjusted value should be calculated using the mean value of all samples (as Ecuador and its experts contend) or the 99% upper prediction limit (\"UPL\") (as Burlington and its experts contend).\n\n302.\n\nThe approach adopted by Ecuador's experts can be summarized as follows. IEMS gathered 192 samples from the Blocks to calculate the background values.533 For IEMS, background values under TULAS are determined by calculating the population mean, i.e. the mean of the complete set of samples. IEMS thus calculated the population mean by taking \"all particles of soil from the unaffected areas in each block, to average them, and to calculate an average concentration of all the particles\".534 Since IEMS did not sample the entire Blocks, it constructed a confidence interval (\"CI\") around \"a range that contains the population mean with a specified probability\".535 IEMS estimated the 99% CI of the mean concentrations, such that there is, in its opinion, a \"99% probability that the true but unknown background mean concentration is below the value presented by IEMS and, conversely, only a 1% probability that it be above\".536 This approach, says IEMS, is \"consistent with the provision of TULAS, although slightly more conservative\", since using a 95% CI would result in lower background concentrations thus increasing the size of the contaminated area.537 Thus, for barium in Block 7 for instance, IEMS calculated the population mean to be 183.65 mg/kg, with a 99% CI value set at 213.10 mg/kg whereas a 95% confidence interval would have resulted in a value of 203.21 mg/kg. In other words, if the 99% CI method is chosen, as advocated by IEMS, there is a 99% probability that the background value for barium is below 213.10 mg/kg and a 1% probability that it is above that value.\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 4.\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 16. To take account of the fact that \"different populations may have different distributions and different variability\" across the two Blocks, IEMS classified the results of soil samples in four groups according to the block and the sample depth in accordance with Chapter 4 of *PROUCL Version 4.0 Technical Guide, EPA/600/R-07/041 (USEPA, 2007)*. IEMS's analysis of variance showed that, except for lead, the parameters were not statistically similar between Block 7 and Block 21. Accordingly, IEMS estimated separately the background levels for Block 7 and Block 21, except for lead where the analysis of variance showed that the results were statistically similar across the Blocks but statistically different between samples less than 1 meter and those below 1 meter. Thus, IEMS estimated separately the background levels for lead for samples collected at less than 1 meter and for samples collected at more than 1 meter. See: IEMS ER4, p. 18.\n\n*Id*., p. 16.\n\n*Id*., p. 17.\n\n*Id*., pp. 17, 46.\n\n303.\n\nIEMS then compared the values of the 99% CI with the values in TULAS Table 2 and then estimated the adjusted regulatory criteria by multiplying by three the site-specific background value \"or 3 times the Table 2 criteria (general background values), whichever was higher\".538 IEMS stressed that, by contrast, GSI's \"selective use of the criteria\" by estimating background values as the 99% UPL is \"erroneous and unreliable\", since it is \"inconsistent with regulatory requirements\".539 For IEMS, no provision states that the background values must be estimated by comparing the 99% UPL to any table in TULAS, let alone to Table 3 as GSI did. Instead of using the 99% UPL, GSI should have calculated the \"true population mean\" of all 192 samples to estimate the 99% CI.540 IEMS further argued that GSI engaged in \"biased manipulation\", since the \"99th percentile is the value that is above 99% of the dataset\", and thus artificially increased the \"tolerance to contamination\".541 In other words, had GSI applied a 100% UPL, the background value would have equalled the highest measured value in clean soil samples. Similarly, after GSI eliminated outliers, its 99th percentile approach resulted in a background value that is above 99% of the dataset, and therefore biased and excessively conservative.\n\n*Id*., p. 46.\n\n*Id*., p. 18.\n\n*Id*., pp. 16, 18.\n\n*Id*., p. 19.\n\n304.\n\nEcuador's experts from RPS concur with IEMS that GSI's use of the 99% UPL is inconsistent with the methodology specified in TULAS. RPS explains that remediation criteria for a particular parameter are not applicable if \"the remediation criterion for a parameter is less than the background concentration\".542 In such cases, the \"background threshold values\" (\"BTVs\") is equal to three times the mean of the background value. In other words, if concentrations at an oilfield site exceed the BTV, \"then remediation is required and the actual cleanup level (remediation criteria) is set equal to 1.5 times the mean of the background data set\".543 While GSI's block-specific remediation criteria equal to 3 times the mean background value are correct, RPS argues that GSI should also have shown \"the actual remediation criteria as 1.5 times the mean background concentration\".544 Instead, GSI's approach underestimates the volume of impacted soils to be remediated. In addition, RPS highlights GSI's use of \"incorrect values for the background soil concentrations\", pointing to discrepancies between the data used by GSI in the ProUCL software with the background soil concentration included in GSI's Table D.18 *Analytical Results for Background Metal Concentrations*.545\n\nRPS ER2, p. 18.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., p. 19.\n\n*Ibid*. RPS pointed in particular to sample CO11-BKGD1-1.90-2.70 showing a \"true barium concentration\" of 250 mg/kg, whereas GSI used a value of 1200 mg/kg as background calculations.\n\n305.\n\nGSI adopts a different approach to estimate background values. While GSI accepts that IEMS's tests may be representative of background soil conditions, GSI criticizes the \"fundamental conceptual error\" committed by IEMS when calculating their background metals concentrations.546 By calculating the 99% upper confidence limit on the mean concentration, GSI considers that IEMS adopted an adjusted mean concentration that is only slightly above the average \"but far below the upper range of concentrations observed in clean samples\", thus resulting in \"approximately 80% of the clean soils at all sites\" being declared by IEMS as being contaminated.547\n\nGSI ER1, p. 37.\n\n*Id*., pp. 38-39.\n\n306.\n\nAccording to GSI, background values are in practice \"commonly established at or near the upper range of observed concentrations (e.g., 99th percentile) of a compound in unaltered \"clean soils\".548 According to GSI, the use of the UPL is \"a well-recognized statistic\" that \"can be employed as a conservative measure of the upper range of normal metals concentrations\", where UPL is defined \"as the value below which a given percentage of the background sample population falls\" and corresponds to the \"upper end of the normal range of measured background concentration\".549 To that end, GSI conducted additional background soil sampling, collecting 91 additional samples, including 12 duplicate samples in the CPUF and Block 7.\n\n*Id*., App. I, p. I.1. See also: GSI ER1, p. 37 (\"According to accepted technical guidelines, \"background\" levels of metals in soils are commonly established at or near the upper range of the observed concentrations, such that a concentration above this level (i.e., beyond the normal range of observations) may be considered abnormal and possibly indicative of an impact\").\n\nGSI ER1, pp. 37-38; GSI ER1, App. I., p. I.1, referring to: USEPA 1989, 1992, 2009; Idaho DEQ, 2009; Sara, 2003.\n\n307.\n\nGSI's approach can be summarized as follows. As a first step, GSI compiled all background samples in a Microsoft Access database and compared the population distributions of metal concentrations in both Blocks. Using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistical test, GSI then determined that the mean background concentrations of all metals, except for lead and nickel in Block 7, were different from those in Block 21, thus justifying evaluating the background soil samples from CPUF/Block7 and Block 21 as \"two distinct background populations, representing site-specific conditions\".550 Since the comparison of IEMS and GSI samples collected in CPUF/Block 7 presented similar background populations, GSI combined its analytical results with those of IEMS \"to create an encompassing background soil dataset (CPUF/Block 7) comprised of 243 unaltered soil samples\".551\n\nGSI ER1, App. I, p. I.3. See also: GSI ER1, App. I, Tables I.2 and I.3.\n\n*Id*., App. I, p. I.3.\n\n308.\n\nAs a next step, GSI excluded data outliers from the background populations in the calculation of the UPL by using Rosner's Outlier Test in the ProUCL software.552 GSI also used half of the detection value for non-detect concentrations. After deriving the 99% UPL for each data set,553 GSI evaluated the 99% UPL value against the population of metals measured in background soil samples.554 It finally proceeded to adjust the soil cleanup criteria based on the applicable regulations in RAOHE and TULAS.555 For GSI, the fact that outliers were excluded and more than 1% of clean soil samples exceeded the 99% UPL for several metals (barium, cadmium and nickel), confirms that its approach is conservative.556 GSI rebuts IEMS's criticism that outliers should only be removed after careful review and that Rosner's Outlier Test should only be used when data follows a normal distribution, by stating that the inclusion of the outliers would have skewed the 99% UPL towards less conservative estimates.557\n\n*Id*., App. I, Attachment I.1.\n\nGSI explained its approach as follows: \"UPLs can be computed using either parametric methods, whereby the data is assumed to display a normal bell-shaped pattern, or nonparametric methods, whereby the data does not exhibit a predictable distribution (e.g., data may be highly skewed towards low or high concentrations). The application of non-parametric statistical methods to normally distributed data is acceptable, although the reverse (application of parametric statistical methods to non-parametric data) is not appropriate [\u2026]. [A]ll metals in the CPUF/Block 7 region and Block 21 displayed non-parametric population distributions, except for lead, which exhibited a normal distribution for both the CPUF/Block 7 region and Block 21, and chromium, which exhibited a normal distribution for CPUF/Block 7. The 99% UPL for each of these metals in the CPUF/Block 7 region and Block 21 was then calculated according to the respective population distribution using the ProUCL Software [\u2026]. Because the nonparametric 99% UPLs for lead in CPUF/Block 7 and Block 21 were actually equal to or lower (i.e., more conservative) than the parametric 99% UPL, the non-parametric 99% UPL statistic has been chosen as a conservative representation of background values for lead in the appropriate geographic areas. In contrast, the parametric 99% UPL for chromium in CPUF/Block 7 was chosen as a conservative representation of the chromium background value in CPUF/Block 7 soils\". GSI ER1, Att. I, p. I.4. GSI added that \"[w]hen background populations from CPUF/Block 7 and Block 21 contained non-detect measurements, the Kaplan Meier estimation method was used to determine summary statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) for the computation of the 99% UPL\". GSI ER1, Att. I, p. I.5.\n\nGSI sought to confirm that the 99% UPLs provide \"reasonable estimates of the normal range of metals in background soils\". It concluded that based on the small percentage of clean samples exceeding the 99% UPL, this method served as an appropriate estimate of the \"typical range of metals in background soils\", further confirming that the estimates are conservative. GSI ER1, App. I, p. I.8.\n\n*Id*., App. I, p. I.8.\n\n*Id*., App. F, p. F.3.1.2.\n\nGSI ER2, App. F, pp. F.3.1.2-F.3.1.2.\n\n309.\n\nWith respect to RAOHE Table 6, GSI considers that the 99% UPL background level is the appropriate cleanup criteria for chemicals for which the relevant 99% UPL background level exceeds the regulatory criteria.558 With respect to TULAS, GSI opines that IEMS not only misinterpreted TULAS but also misrepresented GSI's approach,559 which it explains in the following terms: \"for chemicals for which the relevant 99% UPL background level exceeded the regulatory cleanup level provided in TULAS Table 3 (meaning that the cleanup level logically cannot apply), an action level equal to three times the average background concentration measured for that chemical [is to be used] as the appropriate site-specific cleanup level\".560 Accordingly, this approach not only recognizes that remediation below natural background concentrations is \"infeasible\", but also that \"an additional \u2018significance' factor\" is applied \"to more accurately indicate abnormal conditions that may warrant action\".561\n\nGSI ER1, App. I, p. I.9; GSI ER2, App. F, pp. F.3.1.7-F.3.1.8.\n\nGSI ER2, App. F, pp. F.3.1.4-F.3.1.5.\n\nGSI ER1, App. I, p. I.9; GSI ER2, App. F, p. F.3.1.8.\n\nGSI ER1, App. I, p. I.9.\n\n310.\n\nIn other words, since TULAS does not define when a relevant remediation criterion is inapplicable, GSI opined that the \"only reasonable interpretation\" is that a criterion is inapplicable \"when it is less than the observable range of clean background concentrations\".562 Thus, if the 99% UPL of a given parameter exceeded the remediation criterion, GSI calculated a substitute criterion as mandated by TULAS by (i) establishing the mean background levels, (ii) calculating a substitute criterion by multiplying the mean concentration of the clean background soil samples by three, and (iii) comparing concentrations in the affected area to the substitute criterion to determine if remediation is required.563 By contrast, the effect of IEMS's approach is \"absurd\" according to GSI, since 84% of IEMS's actual clean samples require cleanup under its approach, which constitutes a \"gross overestimate of the cleanup requirements\".564 By ignoring that TULAS specifically requires that soil measurements must be compared to a substituted criterion that is three times the average background concentration, IEMS erroneously concluded that 84% of clean soils are contaminated.565\n\nGSI ER2, App. F, p. F.3.1.4.\n\n*Id*., p. F.3.1.5.\n\n*Id*., pp. F.3.1.6-F.3.1.7.\n\n*Id*., p. F.3.1.7; C-PHB, \u00b6 107.\n\n311.\n\nFor GSI, RPS also misinterpreted TULAS by claiming that a relevant criterion is inapplicable when the mean value of clean background samples is greater than the relevant criterion.566 This approach is \"irrational\" according to GSI, since this would mean that \"approximately half of clean samples used to represent naturally occurring background conditions would require remediation under TULAS regulations\".567 RPS further misapplied TULAS by claiming that the background threshold value should be calculated using three times the mean background concentration. According to GSI, TULAS instructs that three times the mean value should be used as a replacement regulatory criterion \"only when the regulatory criterion provided by TULAS is \u2018inapplicable'\".568 RPS also misrepresented GSI's actions when claiming that GSI should have calculated the actual remediation criteria as 1.5 times the mean value of the background concentration.569 GSI explained that the volume of impacted soils should be determined by using three times the mean value of the background dataset, and TULAS only requires that this volume of soil should be remediated to 1.5 times the mean background samples.570 Accordingly, RPS's approach for calculating soil remediation criteria violates TULAS, since RPS \"replaced the Ecuador criteria with a value equal to 1.5 times the mean background concentration\".571\n\n*Id.,* p.

F.3.2.5.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n(i) *Preliminary remarks*\n-------------------------\n\n312.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that, with slight divergences, both Parties accepted that their background values apply to the entire block, even though the actual background concentrations may vary significantly from one site to another within the same block. The Tribunal further notes that neither Party has pointed to any practice where regulatory criteria have been adjusted to take into account higher natural concentrations in the Blocks.\n\n(ii) *Methodologies to adjust values under RAOHE and TULAS*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nRAOHE Table 6 and Article 4.1.3.3 TULAS allow adapting permissible limits to take into account that natural concentrations of certain chemicals in the soil exceed permissible limits for those substances. However, these two regulations adopt different approaches. RAOHE Table 6 provides for adjusting the Table 6 limits upwards \u2013 \"se pueden incrementar\" \u2013 where they are exceeded by natural concentrations.572 The use of the word \"incrementar\" defeats Ecuador's contention that these limits can also be adjusted downwards. On the other hand, RAOHE Table 6 does not indicate how to assess the natural concentrations or how to adjust the permissible limits to account for these.\n\n\"If the natural (non-contaminated) soils in the area present concentrations higher than the established limits, the values of the respective parameter may be increased to this level, so long as this phenomenon has been statistically verified through monitoring of undisturbed and uninfluenced soils in the same area\" (Translation by the Tribunal). RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6 (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n314.\n\nArticle 4.1.3.3 of TULAS adopts a different approach to the adjustment of the remediation criteria:\n\n\"In case of the inapplicability for the specific case of any parameter established in the present regulation, or in case of the absence in the regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil under study, the Environmental Control Entity shall adopt the following evaluation criteria:\n\nThe regulated entity must establish the background or reference value of the parameter of interest present in the soil. The regulated entity shall determine the present or current concentration of the parameter under study in the affected area. It shall then proceed to compare the obtained results for the concentration present in the soil against the background values. In general, it is considered that a present concentration greater than three times the background value for the soil denotes contamination that requires immediate attention on the part of the Environmental Control Entity. [\u2026] The procedure described shall be coordinated and supervised by the environmental control entity\".573\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Article 4.1.3.3 (**Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0006**).\n\n315.\n\nThis provision goes on to state that the most reliable way to calculate natural concentrations is to collect samples in areas \"immediately outside the area under study\" with no local contamination. Where there is a \"total absence\" of such values in the immediate area surrounding the area under study, the background values may be obtained in regional or national areas. More specifically, it provides some indications on the sampling:\n\n\"In order to determine the background or reference value, at least 5 samples must be taken, if between 5 and 20 samples are taken, the mean value must be selected as the background value\".574\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n316.\n\nIn sum, with different approaches, both RAOHE and TULAS allow adjusting relevant remediation criteria to take into account higher natural concentrations in soils. On the one hand, RAOHE Table 6 merely states that permissible limits can be adjusted upwards when natural concentrations exceed the regulatory criteria without specifying how this is done. On the other hand, TULAS provides that contamination exists when concentration in the soil is greater than three times the mean background value in case a given parameter is absent or inapplicable. In addition, TULAS provides that background values are to be determined by taking at least 5 samples and that \"if between 5 and 20 samples are taken, the mean value must be selected as the background value\".575 This formulation is confusing, as it might be read to suggest using another methodology above 20 samples. Since the regulation provides for no alternative methodology, the Tribunal rejects this suggestion. It therefore finds that, where IEMS collected 192 samples, the mean value of these samples must in any event be estimated so as to comply with TULAS.\n\n*Id*. (**Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0007**).\n\n317.\n\nThe Parties diverge significantly on the proper methodology for adjusting permissible limits. Ecuador's experts from IEMS adopted the 99% CI to determine the mean background concentration, whereas Burlington's experts from GSI held that the proper methodology is to estimate the 99% UPL for each metal in clean background soil samples. In this context, the Tribunal notes that neither RAOHE nor TULAS refer to either methodology, TULAS only referring, as seen above, to the \"mean\" background value (*valor promedio*).576 The Tribunal further notes that GSI, while invoking \"accepted technical guidelines\", in particular of the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States but none from Ecuador, indicated that resort to the 99% UPL \"*can* be employed as a conservative measure of the upper range of normal metals concentrations\",577 and that it was \"*our understanding* [\u2026] that sound technical judgment should be applied in this determination\".578 Absent any express stipulation in the regulations, the Tribunal is disinclined to follow GSI's approach and thus relies on IEMS's approach of estimating the 99% CI even if it too is not strictly compliant with TULAS. This is so, because the 99% CI is a slightly more conservative method than the mean value, there being only a 1% probability that the background mean concentration is above the confidence interval calculated by IEMS. Accordingly, the Tribunal will estimate the background values on the basis of the mean background concentration as adjusted by the 99% CI.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nGSI ER1, p. 38 (emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\nGSI ER2, App. F, p. F.3.2.2 (emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n(iii) *Adjusted values determined by the Tribunal*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nWith respect to RAOHE, the Tribunal notes that the only divergence between the Parties lies in the cadmium values for both Blocks and the nickel value for Block 21. IEMS accepts that the sensitive ecosystem land use criterion for cadmium be adjusted to 2 mg/kg for Block 7, which is the same criterion for agricultural land use, and to 1.77 mg/kg for Block 21. For its part, GSI estimated the background value for cadmium in Block 7 at 3.8 mg/kg, thus requiring in its view an adjustment of both the sensitive ecosystem and agricultural land use criteria. For nickel, GSI estimated the background value in Block 21 to be 47 mg/kg instead of 40 mg/kg. Consistent with its decision to discard GSI's use of the 99% UPL to estimate background values, the Tribunal will adjust the criteria for cadmium as follows: 2 mg/kg for Block 7 and 1.77 mg/kg for Block 21. Similarly, the Tribunal did not adjust the nickel value for Block 21. This approach is consistent with the few instances of practice that the Tribunal discerned in the record. For instance, the Tribunal observes that in two remediation reports for spills in Oso 2 in 2007 and in Mono CPF in 2008, the applicable cadmium value for agricultural land use was held to be 2 mg/kg and not the 3.8 mg/kg advocated presently by Burlington.579\n\nRemediation report on incident in Mono CPF, including subsequent communications and approvals, July to October 2008, pp. 16, 17 and 19 (**Exh. CE-CC-334**) ; Final report by the Consortium on the remediation following a spill incident in a flow line at Oso 2 on 26 May 2007, pp. 5-9 (**Exh. E-432**).\n\n319.\n\nWith respect to TULAS, there is a first significant disagreement between the Parties on when a specified criterion is inapplicable under TULAS, thus justifying adjusting that criterion to reflect background conditions. For IEMS, a given criterion is inapplicable if the mean background concentrations exceed the criterion provided in TULAS Table 2.580 RPS also stated that a remediation criterion is not applicable, for instance, if the remediation criterion for a parameter is less than the background concentration.581 For its part, GSI indicated that a remediation criterion is to be considered inapplicable under TULAS \"when it is less than the observable range of clean background concentrations\", meaning that only if the 99% UPL exceeds the established criterion in Table 3, in which case an adjusted criterion should be established by multiplying by three the mean background concentrations.582\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 46.\n\nRPS ER2, p. 18.\n\nGSI ER2, Att. F, p. F.3.2.2.\n\n320.\n\nTULAS contemplates adjusting remediation criteria in two scenarios, namely in case (i) of the \"inapplicability for the specific case of any parameter established in the present regulation\", or (ii) of the \"absence in the regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil under study\".583 At the outset, the Tribunal stresses that, while TULAS speaks of the \"inapplicability of any parameter\" relevant for the specific case, it should properly be interpreted for present purposes as meaning the inapplicability of any criterion for a given relevant parameter (since it would be contradictory to establish new criteria for a parameter which is held to be inapplicable). The Tribunal notes that neither Party argued that in the present case a relevant parameter is absent in TULAS, but that they advocated differing interpretations on when a criterion of a given parameter is inapplicable. In this context, the Tribunal recalls that TULAS Table 3 contemplates four land uses, namely industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential, but does not provide specific criteria for sensitive ecosystem land use. Thus, it may reasonably be considered that the remediation criteria established in TULAS are inapplicable for sensitive ecosystem land use and that new criteria should be established for this hypothesis by following the procedure provided for in Article 4.1.3.3. This also avoids having to choose either agricultural or residential criteria as a proxy for sensitive ecosystem land use.\n\nTULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Article 4.1.3.3 (**Exh. EL-173**).\n\n321.\n\nIn conformity with its decision not to use GSI's 99% UPL, the Tribunal also rejects GSI's interpretation that a given criterion becomes inapplicable only if the 99% UPL value exceeds the relevant criterion set in Table 3. For the Tribunal, the correct approach to establish new or adjusted permissible limits for sensitive ecosystem land use is to multiply the mean background value by three, and to compare the result with the relevant criterion set out in TULAS Table 3. This approach does away with GSI's criticism that relying on mean background values would imply that clean samples are considered contaminated, an argument that would hold true for Ecuador's background value case (which was rejected above), but not for Ecuador's regulatory criteria case. Thus, for instance, with respect to barium, IEMS calculated a mean background value (adjusted to the 99% CI) of barium in Block 7/CPUF of 213.10 mg/kg, meaning that the permissible limit for barium in that block is 639.30 mg/kg. This value appears reasonable when compared to the permissible limit of 750 mg/kg for agricultural land use and 500 mg/kg for residential land use.584\n\nThe Tribunal notes that for Block 21, IEMS estimated the mean background value for barium at 113.93 mg/kg, but multiplied the barium value of 200 mg/kg in Table 2 by three to calculate a permissible limit of 600 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystem land use. GSI calculated the 99% UPL at 163 mg/kg. Since Burlington did not specifically challenge Ecuador's use of 600 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystem land use, instead arguing that the primary land use in Block 21 is agricultural, the Tribunal accepts IEMS's value of 600 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystem land use in Block 21.\n\n322.\n\nThe issue is somewhat different with respect to vanadium in Block 7, the only other parameter where the Parties disagree on the adjusted value. They concur, however, that the permissible limits for all relevant land uses should be adjusted upwards. This is thus truly a case where the regulatory remediation criteria need adjustment. For the Tribunal, a given criterion becomes inapplicable if (i) the mean background value exceeds the soil quality criterion established in Table 2 and (ii) the newly adjusted criterion calculated as three times the mean background value exceeds any given permissible limit. Thus, for vanadium, the relevant criteria for the contemplated land uses (i.e., industrial and agricultural) must be adjusted since the mean background value calculated by IEMS of 106.71 mg/kg exceeds the 25 mg/kg criterion established in Table 2. Here too, the Tribunal will rely on IEMS's mean background value of 106.71 mg/kg, thus adjusting the applicable permissible limit to 320.75 mg/kg.585 The Tribunal also adopts this value for sensitive ecosystem land use. Although this value is somewhat higher than the one calculated by GSI (i.e., 311 mg/kg), the Tribunal notes that it does not make any difference in terms of actual volumes of soils to be remediated since there are no samples showing vanadium values in between those proposed by either Party. For the same reasons, the Tribunal adopts Ecuador's adjusted value of 186 mg/kg for vanadium in Block 21 for agricultural and industrial land uses, as well as for sensitive ecosystem land use.\n\nWhile 3x106.71 equals 320.13, IEMS uses 320.75 (IEMS ER4, Att. 38), which the Tribunal will employ as well.\n\n323.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal rejects RPS's approach of calculating the remediation criteria as 1.5 times the mean background value concentrations, since the volume of contaminated soils is determined on the basis of the adjusted permissible limit (i.e., a multiple of three of the mean background value), not the adjusted remediation criteria set in TULAS (i.e., a multiple of 1.5 of the mean background value). As GSI correctly stressed, \"TULAS never states that soil samples with concentrations exceeding 1.5 times the mean of background samples must be remediated\", since this would lead to an overestimation of the volume of soil requiring remediation.586\n\nGSI ER2, Att. F, p. F.3.2.4.\n\n324.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal has determined that the applicable remediation criteria are as follows (the adjusted criteria are in bold):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \u2022 Under RAOHE for Block 7 |\n| **Parameter** | **Ecuadorian** **Regulation** | **Regulatory** **Criteria** **SE/Agr/Ind** | **Ecuador's** **adjusted** **value** | **Burlington's** **adjusted** **value** | **Tribunal's** **adjusted** **value** | **Adjusted Criteria SE/Agr/Ind** |\n| Cadmium | RAOHE Table 6 | 1/2/10 | 2 | 3.8 | 2 | **2** /2/10 |\n| Lead | RAOHE Table 6 | 80/100/500 | 80 | 80 | 80 | 80/100/500 |\n| Nickel | RAOHE Table 6 | 40/50/100 | 40 | 40 | 40 | 40/50/100 |\n| \u2022 Under TULAS for Block 7 |\n| **Parameter** | **Ecuadorian** **Regulation** | **Regulatory** **Criteria** **Res/Agr/Ind** | **Ecuador's** **adjusted** **value** | **Burlington's** **adjusted** **value** | **Tribunal's** **adjusted** **value** | **Adjusted Criteria Res/SE/Agr/Ind** |\n| Barium | TULAS Table 3 | 500/750/2000 | 639 | 706 | 639 | 500/ **639** /750/2000 |\n| Chromium | TULAS Table 3 | 65/65/90 | 60 | 65 | 65 | 65/65/65/90 |\n| Vanadium | TULAS Table 3 | 130/130/130 | 320.75 | 311 | 320.75 | 130/ **320** / **320** / **320** |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \u2022 Under RAOHE for Block 21 |\n| **Parameter** | **Ecuadorian** **Regulation** | **Regulatory** **Criteria** **SE/Agr/Ind** | **Ecuador's** **adjusted** **value** | **Burlington's** **adjusted** **value** | **Tribunal's** **adjusted** **value** | **Adjusted Criteria SE/Agr/Ind** |\n| Cadmium | RAOHE Table 6 | 1/2/10 | 1.77 | 2 | 2 | **1.77** /2/10 |\n| Lead | RAOHE Table 6 | 80/100/500 | 80 | 80 | 80 | 80/100/500 |\n| Nickel | RAOHE Table 6 | 40/50/100 | 40 | 47 | 40 | 40/50/100 |\n| \u2022 Under TULAS for Block 21 |\n| **Parameter** | **Ecuadorian** **Regulation** | **Regulatory** **Criteria** **Res/Agr/Ind** | **Ecuador's** **adjusted** **value** | **Burlington's** **adjusted** **value** | **Tribunal's** **adjusted** **value** | **Adjusted Criteria Res/SE/Agr/Ind** |\n| Barium | TULAS Table 3 | 500/750/2000 | 600 | 500 | 600 | 500/ **600** /750/2000 |\n| Chromium | TULAS Table 3 | 65/65/90 | 60 | 65 | 65 | 65/65/65/90 |\n| Vanadium | TULAS Table 3 | 130/130/130 | 186 | 130 | 186 | 130/ **186** / **186** / **186** |\n|  | **4.3** | **Land use criteria** |  |  |  |\n\n325.\n\nHaving determined that RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3 apply to soil remediation, the Tribunal will now address the issue of land use classification. As seen above, both RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3 set different limits depending on the subsequent use (*uso posterior*) of the land.\n\n326.\n\nRAOHE Table 6 distinguishes between industrial, agricultural and sensitive ecosystem land uses, the first being more permissive than the last. TULAS Table 3, for its part, distinguishes between industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential land uses. While the first is also here the most permissive, agricultural or residential use is the least permissive depending on the particular parameter. Since TULAS Table 3 does not contemplate land use for sensitive ecosystems, the Tribunal used the adjusted background values calculated by IEMS as the applicable values for sensitive ecosystems for the relevant parameters (i.e., for barium and vanadium).\n\n327.\n\nThe Parties diverge on the meaning of *uso posterior*, and on the question whether the entire Blocks should be classified as sensitive ecosystem (as Ecuador contends) or agricultural land (as Burlington contends). They further disagree whether the notion of *uso posterior* in RAOHE Table 6 refers to use immediately after remediation (as Burlington argues) or to eventual use at the end of hydrocarbons operations (as Ecuador argues). After setting out the Parties' positions (4.3.1), the Tribunal will first clarify the meaning of *uso posterior*, before addressing the time at which *uso posterior* must be assessed and then setting out its own approach to determine the land use at each site (4.3.2).\n\n**4.3.1 Parties' positions**\n----------------------------\n\n328.\n\nFor Ecuador, *uso posterior* refers to future land use. It does not refer to land use after the Consortium leaves the Blocks but to the time \"when oil operations will end\",587 especially since oil operations are \"*per se* temporary\" and that the oilfields are destined \"to be absorbed again by rainforest\".588 Accordingly, the *current* use of the Blocks, whether Petroamazonas' expansion or the use made by farmers of the land around active fields \"is obviously of no relevance to *future* land use\".589 The Tribunal should therefore characterize all facilities and surrounding areas in the Blocks as sensitive ecosystems,590 especially taking into account IEMS's ecological studies demonstrating that the \"areas in question display characteristics similar to those of a National Natural Area\".591 Such conclusion is further reinforced by the fact, Ecuador argues, that the Blocks overlap with the Sumaco and Yasun\u00ed biosphere reserves, and that a \"significant portion of Block 21 lies within the Huaorani indigenous reserve\".592\n\nTr.

The meaning of** ***uso posterior***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal must determine the meaning of *uso posterior* and at what point in time such use must be assessed. RAOHE Table 6 speaks of \"subsequent use to be given to the remediated soil\" (*uso posterior a darse al suelo remediado*).601 It adds that such use must be indicated in the remediation program to be approved by the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection, which tends to show that the determination is both context-driven and immediately posterior to any remediation. This is reinforced by the use of the expression *uso posterior* (subsequent use), as opposed to the more indeterminate *uso futuro* (future use). It thus appears that the *uso posterior* of land is determined on a case by case basis according to its use immediately after remediation, and that this determination is subject to approval in each instance by the Subsecretariat.602 This reading consequently does not support the argument of a single standard to be applied across the board. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot accept Burlington's position that the agricultural standard applies by default to all off platform areas not specifically designated as sensitive ecosystems.\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. The accompanying text to RAOHE Table 6 indicates the following: \"The permissible limits to be applied in a determined project depend on the subsequent use to be given to the remediated soil, which shall be included in the respective Remediation Program or Project approved by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\nThis conclusion is further reinforced by the introductory comments of Ms. Rosa Zehner, technical assessor of the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, attached to RAOHE: \"In the case of contaminated soils, permissible limits and parameters are established in view of the use that, subsequent to a remediation, is planned to be given thereto\" (Translation by the Tribunal). See: IEMS ER1, Exh. 9, p. 8. Note that these introductory remarks were not attached to Ecuador's exhibit of RAOHE, but were attached to IEMS's exhibit of RAOHE (cp. Exh. EL-174 with IEMS ER1, Exh. 9).\n\n331.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador's position either according to which the entire Blocks must be deemed to be sensitive ecosystem or that their future use, as the expression is used in Ecuadorian law, is necessarily and in all cases to revert to rainforest.603 Ecuador's argument that the Consortium must remediate the entire Blocks back to sensitive ecosystem criteria is incorrect for practical reasons. It makes no sense that an operator should be required to restore to sensitive ecosystem values the soil of an operating platform that will continue in operation. This is especially so in a situation where Ecuador itself concedes that Petroamazonas may well continue to operate the Blocks for another 30 years.\n\nEcuador's expert, RPS, conceded that it would be speculative to determine the long term future land use of the Blocks: \"we don't know what will happen in this area in 30 years or more, it could be used for homes, schools, recreation, agriculture, or just be returned to habitat\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1047:12-15 (Direct, Kerr).\n\n332.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence on record does not support Ecuador's view. To the contrary, the record demonstrates that the *uso posterior* of platforms and other industrial facilities has been consistently classified as industrial.604 This practice has continued after Petroamazonas took over the Blocks in July 2009.605\n\nThe 2003 Remediation Plan of Contaminated Areas in Block 7 and Coca-Payamino (covering Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Payamino 22, and CPFs in Payamino, Coca, and Jaguar), approved by Ecuador's Ministry, indicates that remediation will be done in accordance with the industrial land use criteria set forth in RAOHE Table 6. See: Letter from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to Edgar L\u00f3pez (DINAPA), attaching the Remediation Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino field, 28 January 2003 (**Exh. CE-CC-51**) ; Letter from Vicente Inepa (Ministry of Energy and Mines) to Luis Cobos (Perenco), approving the Block 7/CPUF remediation plan, 13 June 2003 (**Exh. CE-CC-57**).  \n The 10-barrel spill in Payamino 19 in June 2009 was to be remediated back to industrial land use criteria of RAOHE Table 6. See: Perenco Ecuador Limited, (Blasting, Painting and Mechanical Repairs on Gacela Station Tank), March 2005. See: CMCC, note 358.  \n The Oso A and Oso B EIS of April 2006 indicates that at the end of the drilling operations, contaminated soils will be remediated to levels below 4000 mg/kg of TPH, which is the industrial standard under RAOHE Table 6. See: EIS, Oso A and Oso B, Block 7, April 2006, p. 7-70 (**CE-CC-110**) (\"Soil samples shall be taken in areas showing evidence of contamination in order to determine hydrocarbon concentrations and potential contamination. Areas where concentrations above 4,000 mg/Kg are detected shall be remediated to levels below this value\" (Translation by the Tribunal)).  \n Also, the remediation progress report in 2003 regarding remediation in Coca CPF stated that criteria of Table 6 RAOHE are applicable. See: Letter from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to Dr. Huga Chamba (DINAPA), 22 April 2003, p. 1 (**Exh. CE-CC-54**) (\"The value that is important to consider is the TPH (4211.5 mg/Kg), which shows a degree of contamination very close to, but still above, the maximum reference value for industrial-use soils as established in Table 6 of [the RAOHE], which is 4000 mg/Kg\").\n\nThe 2010 Ex-Post EIS' commissioned by Ecuador also employ industrial land use criteria to measure potential effects in the operational areas. See, for instance, Ex-Post EIS for Coca, Payamino, Gacela, Section 3, p. 17 (**Exh. CE-CC-241**) ; Ex-Post EIS for Mono and Jaguar, Section 3.1.6.2., pp. 15-17 (**Exh. CE-CC-242**) ; Ex-Post EIS for Oso, Section 3.1.6.3 (**Exh. CE-CC-236**).\n\n**b. The time at which** ***uso posterior*** **is assessed**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThis raises the question of the time at which the subsequent land use must be assessed. When the operator alleged to have caused the harm is still operating the facilities, the subsequent use is normally assessed at the time of remediation. The position is different here as the Consortium stopped operations in July 2009 and the harm was allegedly caused before, but only brought forward in 2011. In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the most appropriate solution is to assess the subsequent use at the time of the expropriation in August 2009. Indeed, the Tribunal must determine the existing liabilities of the Consortium at the time it was expropriated.606\n\nExpansion activities took place at the following sites: Coca 13, Oso A, B and G, Coca A, Coca K, Yuralpa Pad A. Petroamazonas also undertook to construct a new pipeline connecting Coca 1, Coca CPF and Gacela 1-8. See: CMCC, \u00b6 469; Rejoinder, \u00b6 80; Saltos WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 125-133. Also: Video of Petroamazonas's Expansion of Operations in Blocks 7 and 21, 2 July 2013 (**Exh. CE-** **CC-384**).\n\n**c. The Tribunal's approach to determining subsequent land use**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that functioning platforms should be classified as \u2018industrial'. This applies also to areas that were not industrial in August 2009 but became so under Petroamazonas, with the exception of rights of way which are cleared strips of land and which the Tribunal, in part based on its observations during the Site Visit, classifies as agricultural land.607 The question also arises as to the classification of platforms no longer in operation in August 2009 and which should have been revegetated by the Consortium in accordance with RAOHE.608 Because they were no longer in use in August 2009 (and were not put into use by Petroamazonas), the Tribunal is of the view that these platforms do not qualify as industrial areas and will therefore classify them under the remaining land use categories on a case by case basis according to the circumstances of the relevant site.\n\nThe glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines a right of way (*derecho de v\u00eda*) as follows: \"Fringe of terrain of specific dimensions, in which a duct and/or access road is installed, which traverses one or various properties and to which the owner of the duct has access or a transit servitude, and in which area are established limitations of dominion\" (**Exh. EL-174**) (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\nSee, in particular: Articles 49(i)(2) and 53(c) of RAOHE (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n335.\n\nThe classification of land is more complex with respect to off platform areas. Ecuador argues that all these areas must be classified as sensitive ecosystem. Burlington concedes that sensitive ecosystem criteria apply to a limited number of designated protected areas in Block 7 (Payamino 1/CPF, Payamino 2/8 and Payamino 18) located in the Protected Forests Scientific Station Napo Payamino Cuerpos 1 and 2 Cerro Sumaco, Cuenca Alta of the River Suno Ampliaci\u00f3n,609 which form part of the National System of Protected Areas, Protective Forests, and Forestry Assets of the State (SNAP).610 Burlington also agrees that Nemoca and Waponi-Ocatoe in Block 21 fall within a designated area qualifying as sensitive ecosystem.611 At these locations, GSI applied sensitive ecosystem criteria although the actual land use in Payamino 2/8 and Payamino 1/CPF was arguably different. The Tribunal also notes that ConocoPhillips' own environmental assessment of the Blocks in 2006 recognized that the Puerto Napo \u2013 Yuralpa pipeline in Block 21 traverses three privately managed protected areas, namely the Venecia Protected Forest, the Jatun Sacha Foundation and the Selve Viva Foundation.612 Beyond this, Burlington takes the position that the subsequent use of all off platform, non-industrial land should be considered agricultural.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 284. See: Letter of 16 March 2009 from Milton Freire (Ministry of Environment) to Eric D'Argentr\u00e9 (Perenco) (**Exh. CE-CC-207**) ; Map showing the Blocks' intersections with protected areas (**Exh. CE-CC-266**).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the SNAP map used by Burlington at the Hearing does not mark the protected areas in Block 7 and Block 21 as being part of the SNAP system (**Exh. CE-CC-363**). Additionally, the PANE sheet filed by Burlington indicating the National Heritage of Protected Areas does not contain any protected areas in Block 7 and Block 21 (**Exh. CE-CC-266**).\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 284. See: Letter of 10 March 2009 from Milton Freire (Ministry of Environment) to Eric D'Argentr\u00e9 (Perenco) (**Exh. CE-CC-206**).\n\nHSE & SD Assessment and other Technical Services, *Assets in Ecuador*, November 2006, p. ES-4 (**Exh. CE-CC-126**).\n\n336.\n\nRAOHE Table 6 provides that the sensitive ecosystem values apply to \"sensitive ecosystems *such as* Natural Areas of the National Patrimony or others identified in the corresponding environmental study\" (\"*valores l\u00edmites permisibles para la protecci\u00f3n de ecosistemas sensibles* tales como *Patrimonio Nacional de Areas Naturales y otros identificados en el correspondientie Estudio Ambiental\"*) (emphasis added by the Tribunal). The use of the words \"such as\" \u2013 \"tales como\" \u2013 shows that the reference to formally designated protected areas is illustrative as opposed to exhaustive.613 Hence, the Tribunal cannot accept Burlington's restrictive understanding of sensitive ecosystems. Neither does it agree with Ecuador that all areas within the Sumaco or Yasun\u00ed biosphere reserves automatically qualify as sensitive ecosystems. Indeed, the biosphere reserves under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (\"MAB\") Program are not in fact strictly protected areas in which no human economic activity is tolerated.614\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the introductory remarks attached to RAOHE by Ms. Rosa Zehner, technical assessor of the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection of the Ministry of Energy and Mines: \"Also, a category is established for soils of ecological value subject to specific protection, such as the Amazon swamps\" (Translation by the Tribunal). See: IEMS ER1, Exh. 9, p. 8. These introductory remarks were attached to IEMS's copy of RAOHE (IEMS ER1, Exh. 9).\n\n*Reservas de Biosfera del Ecuador: Lugares excepcionales*, Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador, GTZ/GESOREN-DED-WCS-NCI-UNESCO, Quito, 2010 (**Exh. E-380**) ; Oilfield sites and Sumaco Biosphere Reserve Map (**Exh. E-339**).\n\n337.\n\nUNESCO launched the MAB program in 1971 and the biosphere reserve network in 1976. In 1995, the Seville Strategy was adopted as well as the Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, which sets out the key components of MAB reserves, such as designation, support and promotion of biosphere reserves.615 MAB biospheres should \"strive to be sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale\". Such sites must fulfill three functions: (i) the conservation of landscapes, ecosystems, species and genetic diversity; (ii) the achievement of human and economic development from a sociocultural and ecological point of view; and (iii) the support of local, regional, national and global projects of education, training, research and monitoring of the environment and sustainable development.616 Biosphere reserves comprise a \"mosaic of ecological systems\" that are of significance for \"biological diversity conservation\".617\n\nUNESCO, \"Biosphere Reserves. The Seville Strategy & the Statutory Framework of the World Network\" (UNESCO: Paris, 1996) (**Exh. EL-308**). Biosphere reserves are defined as \"areas of terrestrial and coastal/marine ecosystems or a combination thereof, which are internationally recognized within the framework of UNESCO's programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB), in accordance with the present Statutory Framework\". Statutory Framework, Article 1.\n\nStatutory Framework, Article 3 (**Exh. EL-308**) ; *Reservas de Biosfera del Ecuador: Lugares excepcionales,* Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador, GTZ/GESOREN-DED-WCS-NCI-UNESCO, Quito, 2010, p. 13 (**Exh. E-380**).\n\nStatutory Framework, Article 4(1)-(2) (**Exh. EL-308**).\n\n338.\n\nLand use in these biosphere reserves depends on zoning, each reserve being divided into three zones: (i) a nature reserve or national park as the core area where no economic activity is tolerated (except for traditional uses), (ii) the buffer zone where only activities compatible with the conservation of the ecosystems is allowed, and (iii) the transition zone, which is the external ring of the biosphere and where sustainable development and urbanization can take place.618 The Yasun\u00ed reserve was designated by Ecuador as a MAB biosphere in 1989, and the Sumaco reserve in 2000.619\n\n*Id*., Article 4(5); *Reservas de Biosfera del Ecuador: Lugares excepcionales*, Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador, GTZ/GESOREN-DED-WCS-NCI-UNESCO, Quito, 2010, p. 14 (**Exh. E-380**).\n\nThe Yasun\u00ed reserve covers an area of approximately 2,740,000 hectares and the Sumaco reserve an area of approximately 932,000 hectares. *Reservas de Biosfera del Ecuador: Lugares excepcionales*, Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador, GTZ/GESOREN-DED-WCS-NCI-UNESCO, Quito, 2010, p. 26 (**Exh. E-380**).\n\n339.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal notes that neither of the Blocks intersect with the core area or buffer zone of these reserves; the sites under review only overlap with the transition zones.620 Further, the Yasun\u00ed and Sumaco biosphere reserves under the MAB program have not been designated as part of the protected areas known as SNAP, with the exception of their core areas (i.e., the Parque Nacional Sumaco and the Parque Nacional Yasun\u00ed).621 The partial overlap of the Blocks with the Sumaco and Yasun\u00ed reserves does not *per se* impose a classification as sensitive ecosystems. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Huaorani reserve partly overlaps with Block 21, but not with the Yuralpa field where most of the environmental harm in that block is alleged to have occurred. It is therefore not material to determine the land use in that field.622\n\nFor the Sumaco reserve, compare the following maps: Oilfield Sites and Sumaco Biosphere Reserve Map (**Exh. E-339**) and *Reservas de Biosfera del Ecuador: Lugares excepcionales,* Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador, GTZ/GESOREN-DED-WCS-NCI-UNESCO, Quito, 2010, p. 85 (**Exh. E-380**). ConocoPhillips's Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainable Development (HSE&SD) assessment conducted in 2006 states that although neither block overlaps with the Sumaco Napo-Galeras National Park, \"both blocks do overlap (about 50 percent of the total surface area) the \u2018transition zone' or buffer area of the Sumaco Napo-Galeras Biosphere Reserve, established in 2000 by the Man and Biosphere program of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)\". HSE & SD Assessment and other Technical Services, *Assets in Ecuador,* November 2006 (**Exh. CE-CC-126**).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Yasun\u00ed National Park and Sumaco-Napo Galeras National Park were designated under the SNAP system in 1979 and 1994, respectively, but they do not overlap with the oilfields in the Blocks and Ecuador has not alleged this to be the case. See: Map of Sites in Blocks 7 and 21 that Intersect Protected Areas (2012) (**Exh. CE-CC-266**) ; Ministry of the Environment, PANE data sheet, 18 April 2013, items 8 and 9 (**Exh. CE-CC-363**). See also the SNAP map presented by Burlington at the Hearing: Burlington's Closing Statement, Slide 63; R -PHB, \u00b6 171; C-PHB, \u00b6 121.\n\nThe Huaorani reserve extends to the Waponi-Ocatoe and Dayuno fields. See map of Huaorani reserve and Block 21 attached to: Confidential Memorandum, ConocoPhillips, p. 36 (**Exh. E-214**) ; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 38. Burlington concedes that Waponi-Ocatoe falls in a designated area where sensitive ecosystem criteria apply. See: Map of Sites in Blocks 7 and 21 that Intersect Protected Areas (2012) (**Exh. CE-CC-266**). As seen further below, the Tribunal has classified the land use surrounding the platforms at these sites as being sensitive ecosystem based on the fact that they are surrounded by dense forest, without needing to rely on the fact that these areas fall within the Huaorani indigenous reserve.\n\n340.\n\nThis said, the Tribunal is mindful that the Amazon region in Ecuador is considered to be one of the most diverse and sensitive ecological areas in the world,623 and that it finds special mention in the 2008 Constitution as was seen above.624 The Tribunal also recalls IEMS's evidence that secondary forests surrounding platforms can function as biological corridors connecting preserved areas and modified primary forests, thus fostering biodiversity conservation and protection.625 However, IEMS's biological resource assessment in no way justifies qualifying the entirety of the Blocks as sensitive ecosystems for present purposes.626 Indeed, in light of the existing human dwellings in proximity of many platforms in both Blocks, especially in the northern part of Block 7, the Tribunal considers IEMS's opinion concerning the \"regeneration capacity of the rainforest\"627 too general and vague to support the adoption of a single, all-encompadsing standard across the Blocks and thus disregard the actual situation on the ground. In line with the Tribunal's earlier conclusion, subsequent land use must be assessed case by case, by reference to the particular circumstances of each site.\n\nThe Consortium and previous operators have acknowledged the sensitivity of the land surrounding several platforms, for example in the Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plans for C\u00f3ndor Norte and Lobo 3 (\"All water bodies that are localized in the area of influence of the project correspond to zones that are sensitive to the activities of the project, therefore sensitivity is high\"). See further examples compiled by IEMS regarding Yuralpa Pad D and West Lobo. IEMS ER4, pp. 41-42; Environmental Impact Study for the Yuralpa Field, Block 21, p. 2-2 (**Exh. E-156**). See also Oryx's Environmental Impact Study for Block 7, where it is stated that \"[g]iven that Oryx's operations take place in the fragile and diverse amazonic ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem that dominates the course of the Napo river and its tributaries, it is also justified that those operations be performed adopting all possible technical and economical, preventive and corrective measures to reduce to the minimum possible the undesirable environmental effects [\u2026]\" (Translation by IEMS). Environmental Impact Study of Block 7, pp. 2-3 (**Exh. E-254**).\n\nSee paragraphs 202-203 above. In particular, refer to: Articles 250 and 259 of the 2008 Constitution (**Exh. C-413** ; **Exh. P-12**).\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 15, pp. 29-30.\n\nFor instance, IEMS conceded that secondary forests around platforms showed various degrees of human intervention, presented \"low values of mammalian diversity\" and \"medium values of bird diversity\" as a result of oilfield operations, but also because of crop areas and grasslands. IEMS ER4, Att. 15, p. 34.\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 15, p. 34.\n\n341.\n\nThe Site Visit provided the Tribunal an important, first-hand view of the actual use of land surrounding the platforms. By way of general observations, the Tribunal noted that the vegetation cover was much denser in Block 21 than in Block 7, and that the CPUF is located in the most developed part of the Blocks. This does not mean that all disputed areas in Block 21 are sensitive ecosystems, nor that all land surrounding platforms in the CPUF is agricultural. Again, a site-specific assessment is needed. Yet, the general characterization just mentioned may inform such assessments.\n\n342.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal has engaged in a case-bycase assessment of each site to determine subsequent land use. Its assessment is primarily based on evidence gathered during the Site Visit, the explanations provided by the experts,628 and the satellite imagery and aerial photogaphs of the sites closest in time to the date of expropriation. Where the record contains no images or photographs from that period, the Tribunal decided on the basis of the best available evidence.\n\nFor IEMS, refer in particular to: IEMS ER3, Annexes C and C Corrected; IEMS ER4, Att. 38. For GSI, refer in particular to GSI ER1, App. L and GSI ER2, App. L.\n\n343.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal developed the following guidelines to assess land use at any given site:\n\ni. Platforms in operation on or after the date of expropriation have been classified as industrial, as explained above.\n\nii. Formally designated protected forests are classified as sensitive ecosystems (except for platforms), regardless of other current uses.629\n\niii. Where platforms are completely surrounded by primary or secondary forest, the Tribunal classified the forested areas as sensitive ecosystem.\n\niv. Where areas surrounding the platform are largely cleared, the Tribunal classified the land use of those areas as agricultural.\n\nv. Where multiple land uses may apply to a single site,630 the Tribunal looked more specifically at the sampling locations to determine the land use in that specific area.631\n\nvi. Where land use appeared mainly agricultural, the Tribunal nonetheless looked more closely at particular features, such as swamps, creeks and rivers, that may justify stricter criteria.\n\nvii. Where human dwellings, including school or other community buildings are adjacent to a water system and in close proximity to a contaminated site, the Tribunal applied sensitive ecosystem criteria for RAOHE parameters and residential criteria under TULAS Table 3 (for parameters not contemplated in RAOHE Table 6).632\n\nviii. For platforms that have been abandoned, the Tribunal did not apply industrial criteria to the platform, but the relevant land use of the surrounding area.633\n\nix. In cases of doubt, the Tribunal adopted the most protective standard in conformity with the principles of precaution and *in dubio pro natura*.\n\nThe following sites in the CPUF fall within a protected forest: Payamino 1/CPF, Payamino 2/8, and Payamino 18. Payamino 4, Payamino 14, 20 & 24 and Payamino 23 are immediately adjacent to the protected forest. The following sites in Block 21 fall within State Forest Heritage: Nemoca and Waponi-Ocatoe. Dayuno and Yuralpa 01 are in close proximity of the State Forest Heritage. Map of Sites in Blocks 7 and 21 that Intersect Protected Areas (2012) (**Exh. CE-CC-266**).\n\nSee, for instance: Lobo 1.\n\nSee, for instance: Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 4, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 9, Lobo 3.\n\nSee, for instance: Jaguar 1 (Area 2M), Mono CPF.\n\nSee, for instance: C\u00f3ndor Norte, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 9.\n\n344.\n\nIn applying these guidelines, the Tribunal also considered the administrative practice of land classification, as it arises from approved remediation reports. Most remediation reports address on platform exceedances and classify the land as industrial. As regards off platform exceedances, the few remediation reports referred to by Burlington mostly refer to agricultural use.634\n\nSee, for instance: Payamino CPF (**Exh. CE-CC-151**), Mono CPF (**Exh. CE-CC-189**) and Oso 2 (**Exh.

The ex-post reports very generally apply agricultural criteria to the Coca, Payamino, Lobo and Mono fields,635 which appears too wide an approach for the Tribunal to follow without proceeding to its own site-specific assessment. As for Petroamazonas, it applied agricultural criteria to Coca 6 and Yuralpa Pad E. In this context, the Tribunal also observes that IEMS indicated that agriculture partly surrounds the platforms at Coca 6, Coca 8, Lobo 3, Lobo 1, Oso 9, Mono CPF and Payamino CPF.636\n\nRefer to: Entrix, Ex-post Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan: Coca Complex of Block 7, July 2010 (**Exh. CE-CC-241**), and Entrix, Ex-post Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan: Mono Complex of Block 7, July 2010 (**Exh. CE-CC-242**).\n\nSee, for instance: CMCC, \u00b6 301, referring to: IEMS ER3, Annex H (REC 7-COC06-389, p. 5; REC 7-LOB3-475, p. 47; REC 7-LOB1-208, p. 44; REC 7-OS09-345 p. 62).\n\n346.\n\nThis being so, the Tribunal stresses that the administrative practice of Ecuadorian authorities was certainly helpful. At the same time, reliance on such practice cannot excuse the Tribunal from the task of making its own assessment on the basis of the entire record to ensure that it applies the regulatory criteria correctly.\n\n347.\n\nThe result of the Tribunal's land use assessment following the parameters just set out is described in the site review (Section 4.6).\n\n**4.4 Guidelines for calculating impacted areas and volumes of impacted soils**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Parties advocated divergent approaches for calculating the extent of soil contamination in the Blocks. Whereas Ecuador argued that, due to the impossibility of sampling the entire Blocks, the extent of soil contamination can only be established by extensive modelling (4.4.1), Burlington favored delineation through a process described as \"hand-contouring\" (4.4.2). After reviewing the Parties' methodologies, the Tribunal will set out its own approach (4.4.3).\n\n**4.4.1 IEMS's methodology and Ecuador's position**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nFor Ecuador, GSI's approaches \"to sampling, data collection and analysis do not provide a sound or reasonable basis\" to quantify the extent of harm in the Blocks, since they are \"inherently subjective and arbitrary\", and thus should be disregarded.637 By contrast to GSI's \"contrived and unreliable *sui generis* delineation theory\", Ecuador submits that IEMS reliably and conservatively quantified the extent of harm through modelling and by using the \"widely accepted\" Inverse Distance Weighted (\"IDW\") interpolation technique.638\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 329.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 331.\n\n350.\n\nEcuador explains that IEMS used the computer software ArcGIS to calculate the total volume of contaminated soil.639 Using ArcGIS, IEMS developed a Geographical Information System for Quantifying Environmental Impact Soil (\"SIGAAS\"), which mapped every production facility within Block 7/CPUF and Block 21.640 For the areas of contaminated soil, IEMS mapped each sample it collected, delineated a 10-meter radius around it (called a \"buffer\"), and defined the boundaries of the contaminated area as the outer limits of all buffers (a group of buffers is referred to as \"cluster\") marked by a rectangle called \"bounds\" (see figure below).641\n\n**IEMS's schematic representation of macro to micro scales**642\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 174. IEMS used ArcGIS 10.0 software and included therein: (i) the geographic location of the sites, including oilfield facilities, population centers, principal roads, rivers, land use in 2009 and 2010, (ii) the geographic locations of the identified RECs, (iii) the geographic location of the sampling, and (iv) the relation between the previous information with the general characteristics of the sites using satellite imagery, maps and aerial photographs.

See also: Reply, p. 47, Figure 1.\n\n351.\n\nTo calculate the volumes of contaminated soil, IEMS modeled six different layers of depths (from 0 to 1 meter, 1-2 meters, 2-3 meters, 3-4 meters, 4-5 meters, and more than 5 meters deep).643 For each layer, IEMS measured the level of pollution for each contaminant. IEMS explained that its analytic model required at least three polluted samples per layer and that layers with less than 3 polluted samples were disregarded.644 Once the bounds and the layers were established, IEMS (i) divided the area within the bounds into \"cells\" of one square meter; (ii) categorized each cell where samples were taken as non-contaminated, contaminated in excess of background values but below regulatory levels, or contaminated in excess of regulatory thresholds; and (iii) categorized each surrounding cell applying the IDW method of interpolation with ArcGIS.645 With that method, the value attributed to each surrounding cell is a function of the value of the sample data cells and the distance between the sample cells and the surrounding cells. In other words, the closer a sample data cell is to a surrounding cell, the more impact it has on the surrounding cell's value. In consonance with IEMS's conservative model, argues Ecuador, total volumes of contaminated soil were calculated only within the bounds.646\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 176; IEMS ER3, Annex A.8, pp. 6-7.\n\nIEMS explained that: \"Since the interpolation method requires at least three sampling points within the same analysis layer in order to generate an area, and also the samples corresponding to these points must have significant contamination values in order to be able to evaluate the level of dispersion, those sampling points which showed the existence of contamination but which did not meet these conditions (for example, when only two samples were available for a layer, even if they were contaminated) were not included in the modeling process, in keeping with the conservative methodology used for the study\". IEMS ER3, p. 146. IEMS further held that: \"This methodology is conservative since it did not include identified or suspected areas of contamination that could not be quantified with acceptable certainty (e.g., because our modeling requires at least three contaminated samples within the same depth; anything less than three samples were not modeled)\". IEMS ER4, p. 5. See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 429; Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 932:21-933:5 (Tribunal, Chaves).\n\nIEMS ER3, p. 147; IEMS ER3, Annex A.8, p. 10.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 176-179.\n\n352.\n\nThe IDW interpolation method was necessary, according to Ecuador, due to the sheer scale of the contaminated areas and because hand contouring would require disproportionate resources.647 IDW was chosen among various other models on the basis of the characteristics on the ground, and the model was duly adjusted to account for the particular characteristics of each site. In addition, Ecuador argues that literature confirms that IDW is a recognized and well-understood form of linear interpolation. Contrary to the assertion of Burlington's expert Professor Rouhani, the \"*deterministic* linear interpolator IDW is not conditional on mathematical semivariance (\u2018 *spatial correlation* ')\", since semivariance is only required with the *geostatistical* linear interpolation method known as \"kriging\".648 In this context, Ecuador explains that IDW is a deterministic, not a geostatistical interpolator. The corollary of the foregoing is that IDW assumes spatial correlation. Accordingly, spatial correlation was not tested by IEMS because IDW is not mathematically dependent on semivariance.649\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 409, referring to: Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 689:18-690:2 (Direct, Chaves).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 412 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 414.\n\n353.\n\nEcuador further contends that Professor Rouhani's \"desktop review\" employed a wholly inapplicable analysis.650 For instance, variograms are not used to evaluate IDW on a post hoc basis. Indeed, Professor Rouhani conceded that his approach was \"sub-optimal\".651 Moreover, IEMS confirmed that the contamination in the Blocks was in any event sufficiently correlated at each particular site, and Professor Rouhani conceded that practical experience trumps statistical analysis.652 Finally, Burlington's reference to literature suggesting that IDW should not be used for decision-making is misplaced, since (i) the literature relied upon by Burlington is published by the software developer of ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst, (ii) that manual does not exclude the use of IDW but merely cautions users about the reliability of the IDW interpolations, and (iii) IEMS applied IDW conservatively and with all due caution, for instance, by applying control systems and prediction capacity.653\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 415.\n\n*Ibid*., referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1821:16-17 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 418, referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1808:18-1809:1 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 419.\n\n354.\n\nWith regard to the last point, Ecuador insists that IEMS's comprehensive model relies on robust sampling taking into account topography and site features. Furthermore, modeling was undertaken within small-bounded and well-sampled areas. These bounds circumscribed areas of known contamination. Also, contrary to Professor Rouhani's assertion, IEMS included clean samples in its modeling. In addition, IDW was only used in those locations with a minimum of three nearby data points, and IEMS weighted the IDW interpolations conservatively by using a power of 3, instead of the standard power of 2, the consequence being that the importance given to each sample decreased rapidly.654 Finally, IEMS did not interpolate between points separated by more than 300 meters.655\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 431. See also: IEMS ER3, Annex A.8, p. 9.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 432.\n\n355.\n\nEcuador further asserts that Burlington errs when stating that the IDW method is \"conceptually flawed\" or \"scientifically inappropriate\".656 In fact, Professor Rouhani confirmed at the Hearing that IEMS's IDW approach is a \"systematic space-wide analysis\".657 Indeed, the experts on both sides employed some form of linear interpolation. Yet, as Professor Rouhani noted at the Hearing, GSI used the \"rudimentary\" hand contouring technique, while IEMS used the more powerful and conservative IDW.658 Ecuador further explains that GSI also used mathematical forms to interpolate the extent of negative impacts. In fact, \"all experts agree that a mathematical approach is the scientifically correct way to estimate environmental contamination\".659 Moreover, GSI's criticism of using computer software is unfounded, since GSI also used a computer for its \"hand-drawn\" contour lines.660 Finally, GSI's claim that IEMS extrapolated from a given point outwards is plainly wrong, according to Ecuador. Interpolation was done within well-defined bounds, circumscribing \"heavily sampled areas which were known to contain contamination\".661\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 394, referring to: Rejoinder, \u00b6 159.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 407, referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1799:5 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 396.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 399.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 400-404.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 405-406.\n\n356.\n\nRegarding GSI's quantification of contamination, Ecuador argues that GSI's approach is unreliable for various reasons: (i) GSI did not undertake a site-wide analysis; (ii) GSI's self-made and arbitrary topographical exclusion rules are scientifically flawed; (iii) GSI failed to \"step out\" to take additional samples until clean soil was reached; (iv) GSI's manual delineation approach is arbitrary and (v) produces massive errors; and (vi) GSI's contingency factor cannot iron out the wide-scale methodological shortcomings of GSI's delineation approach.662\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 333, 335-391.\n\n357.\n\nFirst, Ecuador stresses that GSI limited itself to IEMS's sampling without itself engaging in a site-wide analysis, thus undermining its claim of a comprehensive assessment.663 For Ecuador, proper delineation would require an assessment on a meter-by-meter grid basis. Since it is Burlington's burden to prove the absence of significant negative impacts, says Ecuador, one would have expected GSI to undertake a systematic assessment: \"[T]he easiest way for GSI to disprove IEMS' quantification of the negative impact was to sample, meter-by-meter, across the sites and perform a true delineation\".664 Critically, Burlington not only decided not to undertake site-wide sampling, it also decided not to test seriously, \"whether or not IEMS' sampling program was representative of contamination across the Blocks\".665 Ecuador further argues that Burlington's and GSI's punctual criticisms fail to address the more general question \"whether, as a whole, IEMS' sample design produced a representative sample set upon which to found their interpolations\".666\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 358.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 344.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 345.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n358.\n\nSecond, GSI's \"*sui generis* delineation\" rests on a set of misplaced arbitrary and selfmade topographical exclusion rules,667 which GSI nonetheless does not follow, according to Ecuador. As a starting point, Ecuador states that it bears recalling that both RPS and IEMS confirmed that once contamination reaches the subsoil \"any surface topographic features will no longer have any impact on how the contamination migrates through the subsoil\".668 Importantly, GSI applied its own topographical rules in an arbitrary manner. In doing so, Professor Rouhani admitted that GSI failed to take further delineation samples around exceedance points, such as, for instance, in Coca 8, where GSI did not take any delineation samples to the northeast, east, southeast, south or southwest of exceedance point # 5 (CO08-4M-03).669 Ecuador highlighted that Professor Rouhani accepted that \"it would have been much easier to solve this problem by just having one more delineation sample\".670\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 349-351, where Ecuador provides a list of these topographical exclusion rules: (i) topographic features, such as streams and catchment areas were considered; (ii) impacts within stream features were bounded by the stream banks; (iii) upstream and downstream extents of impacts extend to the nearest point with concentrations below the applicable criteria in each direction; (iv) impacts that affect a localized area on a slope are assumed to extend twice as far down slope than across slope; (v) site features were always considered, such as edges of pits, platforms, oil-water separators, and/or roads; (vi) sampling results of points located more than 100 meters away from an exceedance point were only considered from a qualitative standpoint on a case-by-case basis, but were not used for interpolation purposes. Ecuador admonishes GSI for not providing any justification for these rules, or not providing explanations how factors within these rules were considered. See, for instance: GSI ER1, App. L, Att. L.6.E, p. L.1 (Coca 8).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 350.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 360. Ecuador further points to Exceedance #1 (CO08-4M-07), where GSI did not take any further delineation samples to the northwest, west, southwest, or the south, and Exceedance #4 (CO08-4M-04), where GSI did not take any further delineation samples to the south. Also referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1805:19-1806:3 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 353, referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1805:16-18 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\n359.\n\nThird, Ecuador criticizes that GSI did not \"step outwards\" to take additional samples until clean soil was reached.671 Ecuador explained that \"[i]n every case GSI's delineations are founded on only two samples \u2013 one being an *\u2018exceedance\u2019* and one being a \u2018 *non-exceedance* '\".672 Yet, as IEMS stated, the most obvious step to achieve a true delineation would have been to continue sampling until clean soil was uncovered. To compound matters, Ecuador stresses that GSI willfully put dirty samples back into the ground, discarding them totally.673 This happened not only in a few instances as claimed by GSI, but in at least 6 sites (of the 17 where GSI took delineation samples).674 When asked to comment, Ecuador states, GSI \"cynically\" explained: \"And the reason for that is because we stepped out because we're looking for the clean margin\".675 For Ecuador, \"[t]rue delineation required continued sampling in all directions until all contamination was captured\".676\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 356.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 359 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 363.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 365, pointing to: Coca 1, Coca 6, Coca 8, Jaguar 1, Mono CPF and Payamino 23.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 363, citing: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1588:6-8 (Cross, Bianchi).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 362.\n\n360.\n\nFourth, Ecuador states that GSI's delineation approach is in any event wholly subjective and arbitrary.677 GSI cites no literature in support of its *sui generis* approach. The hand drawn isoconcentration contour lines are a \"very rudimentary form\" of interpolation, as Professor Rouhani conceded.678 In addition, this technique provides no certainty as it is not possible to assess the errors associated with the tick marks or the hand drawn contour lines.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 372-381.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 374, referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1793:19-1794:3 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\n361.\n\nFifth, GSI's approach produced massive errors according to Ecuador, notably because of its \"sample dilution\" (both through the use of composite samples and by putting dirty samples back into the ground).679 Finally, GSI's \"all purpose 20% \u2018 *contingency* '\" cannot account for the errors in GSI's delineations and is a \"completely inadequate margin for the massive limitations to, and errors inherent in, GSI's delineations\".680 Ecuador nonetheless points out that both Parties' experts agree that a contingency factor ranging from 20%-30% should be included.681\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 382-386.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 333, 387-391 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 873.\n\n**4.4.2 GSI's methodology and Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nFor Burlington, Ecuador's reliance on IEMS's computer model to estimate volumes of allegedly contaminated soil is \"[o]ne of the most consequential flaws in Ecuador's environmental claim\".682 The result is to artificially inflate the estimates of soil contamination by relying on modelling instead of delineating actual contamination in the fields.683 Burlington also criticizes IEMS for committing serious errors in constructing its model,684 and argues that had IEMS engaged in validation testing, it would have realized that the model is \"highly unreliable\".685\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 154.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 159-171.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 172-182.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 183-194.\n\n363.\n\nAccording to Burlington, the modelling methodology is incorrect and unreliable,686 in particular because specific circumstances which may justify using computer predictions as a substitute for real data are not present here.687 Relying on Professor Rouhani, Burlington argues that the only reliable method for the Blocks is \"site-specific field delineation, relying on real data and observations\".688 Therefore, GSI employed the methodology known as \"hand-contouring\" which involves \"sampling known or suspected areas of contamination and then \u2018delineating' these areas by taking additional samples until clean soil is reached\".689 These clean samples together with topographical features then provide the \"*contours* of the contaminated area\".690\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 383-396.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 156.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 156, 161; Rouhani ER, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 98, 100. Burlington further argued that \"[b]y its nature, therefore, this modeling process generates an imperfect image of reality, and it should only be used when real data is not reasonably obtainable\". Rejoinder, \u00b6 162.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 160.\n\n*Ibid*. (emphasis in the original); GSI ER1, \u00b6 234 and App. D, pp. 10-11, 23-25; GSI ER2, \u00b6 49(c). See also the video explaining hand-contouring (**Exh. CE-CC-368**).\n\n364.\n\nWith respect to Ecuador's modelling exercise, Burlington argues that IEMS used ArcGIS to model the extent of contamination, although that software is \"not designed to extrapolate outwards from a particular data point\" but serves only to \"interpolate between plotted data values\".691 As Professor Rouhani indicated, IDW is \"simply not an appropriate method for modeling soil contamination in the Blocks, as it cannot make predictions within any acceptable range of reliability\".692\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 384; GSI ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 120-121 and Exhibit 20.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 155; Rouhani ER, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 69.\n\n365.\n\nBurlington explains that IEMS should have interpolated whereby \"samples are taken moving outward from a contaminated point until compliant samples are found\".693 Instead, IEMS used a \"fill\" function in ArcGIS to connect \"non-clean\" samples, thus ignoring topography (as the examples of Punino and Coca 1 demonstrate)694 and other physical features (such as low-lying drainages, roads or hills),695 resulting in a modelling exercise where the \"vast majority of areas\" claimed to be contaminated are in fact areas where IEMS's own samples comply with Ecuadorian regulatory criteria \"or areas where no samples were taken at all\".696 In addition, IEMS's models extend \"far beyond the vicinity of any of IEMS's samples\" thus imputing alleged contamination to areas where no sampling was undertaken.697 Burlington also criticizes IEMS's \"inconsistent treatment of samples taken from pits\", in particular by using those samples to interpolate in areas extending beyond the boundaries of the pits,698 as well as IEMS's substitution of \"near-detection-limit values\" for non-detect samples.699\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 385.\n\nGSI ER1, \u00b6 125 and App. F.5, pp. 10-12, 14-15. Burlington explained the consequence of the failure to take into account topography and other physical features as follows: \"IEMS's election to wholly ignore the physical characteristics of the Blocks, many areas of which would naturally constrain contamination, appears deliberate. It specifically selected low-lying areas for its sampling points, since contamination naturally migrates down-gradient. It then selected a modeling procedure that ignored these physical boundaries and \"found\" contamination in surrounding upland areas where impacts are simply unfeasible\" (footnotes omitted). CMCC, \u00b6 388. See further: GSI ER1, \u00b6 117 and App. F.5, p. 14.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 393.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 386; GSI ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 124-127 and Exhibit 21; Rejoinder, \u00b6 182; GSI ER2, App. F.5, pp. 12-14.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 393.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 182; GSI ER2, App. 5, pp. 14-19.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 182; GSI ER2, App. 5.\n\n366.\n\nAccording to Burlington, IEMS provided no explanation for choosing the IDW method over other methods.700 IDW only calculates an \"average, weighted by distance\", based on the assumption that all points are \"correlated\", irrespective of \"how far away one travels from those samples, how unrelated the area being interpolated is to the one from which the samples were taken, or whether there are topographic or other features that would naturally isolate one area from the other\".701 In other words, Burlington submits that IEMS's model is \"blind to the absence of correlation between the existing data and the point that it has been instructed to predict\".702\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 173.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 173-174.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 174.\n\n367.\n\nEcuador's argument that the assessment of actual soil conditions would have required 1.12 million additional samples is unavailing according to Burlington, especially since (i) sampling was not required in a majority of the Blocks where IEMS did not even identify any exceedances or recognized environmental conditions (\"RECs\"), (ii) 88% of IEMS's sampling locations comply with regulatory criteria, and (iii) IEMS failed to consider all available data, ignoring \"*more than 500 soil samples*, including *all* of the data collected by GSI (390 soil samples) as well as IEMS's own samples from its most recent field campaign (157 soil samples)\".703 Burlington argues that the difference between IEMS's and GSI's approaches is best illustrated when comparing the results for barium contamination in Mono CPF, where IEMS's model predicts contamination \"that has no relation to the topography of the site or the existence of clean samples\".704 The following image is used by Burlington to show how GSI used delineation samples and topography to hand-contour the contamination:705\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 168 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 163-165.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 163; GSI ER1, App. L, Mono CPF, Figure L.50.E.B.1.\n\n368.\n\nBy contrast, Burlington explains that the red area in IEMS's model below706 shows Ecuador's regulatory case and demonstrates how IEMS predicted contamination that has no relation to topography or clean samples:707\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 164; see also image at \u00b6 180. The Tribunal notes that this map does not correspond to the one found in IEMS's annexes and that Burlington did not identify the source of this map. See: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Mono CPF, p. 26 and Annex C Corrected, Mono CPF, p. 27; IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Mono CPF, p. 29. It appears that the map was generated by GSI as part of an exercise to assess the effect of various model search radiuses on the predicted area of impacted soils, and in particular the effect of the variable search radius employed by IEMS. See: GSI ER2, p. 35, Exhibit 17 and Annex F.5, p. F.5.7, Figure F.5.5. As seen below (paragraph 376), the Tribunal relied on the maps prepared by IEMS.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 164. Burlington explained that: \"The red area represents predicted exceedances of IEMS's regulatory criteria, and suggests that there is \u2018contamination' spreading uphill and over the platform. Such a result is clearly irrational: it bears no apparent relationship to the topography observed on the ground or the location of the actual exceedances (none of which were on the platform)\". *Id*., \u00b6 165.\n\n369.\n\nAccording to Burlington, employing appropriate delineation methods would reduce IEMS's estimations \"to virtually nothing\".708 Burlington further explained that IEMS compounded matters by engaging in a series of \"extraordinary errors and omissions\" in constructing and applying its method, thus producing distorted results.709 In particular, Burlington highlights the fact that IEMS converted non-detect samples into positive values (so-called false positives) with the result that the ArcGIS software erroneously used \"positive data values to generate maps of allegedly \"contaminated\" areas\".710 This resulted, Burlington says, in a manipulation of 79% of IEMS's data points.711 Ecuador's explanation regarding the power function is to no avail since the power function simply instructs the IDW model \"how *heavily* to weight one sample compared to another based on their proximity\", but will \"always calculate a value for every cell in the modeled area that is between the minimum and maximum sample value, *no matter what power is used*\".712 Instead of using a fixed search radius to avoid overreaching, IEMS used a variable search radius resulting in the model's IDW calculations continuing to run \"until it reaches the model's bounds\",713 as GSI demonstrated when modifying the bounds in the model.714\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 396.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 157.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 399; Rejoinder, \u00b6 182; GSI ER2, App. F.5, p. 5.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 403; GSI ER1, \u00b6 74.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 175 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 177-178.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 178-181; GSI ER2, \u00b6 86 and App. F.5, pp. 6-9.\n\n370.\n\nFinally, Burlington argues that IEMS's failure to engage in meaningful validation testing proves the unreliability of its model, Professor Rouhani having confirmed that these kinds of models require validation testing.715 As a basic reality check, IEMS should at the very least have compared its model to GSI's 390 soil samples or its own additional 157 samples. Instead, IEMS only plotted its new sample locations on its site maps resulting in clean samples appearing in allegedly contaminated areas such as Coca 8, Coca 9, Coca 18-19, Payamino 4, Mono CPF, Mono 10-12 and C\u00f3ndor Norte.716 In this context, IEMS's cross-validation at Coca 8 taking \"a single analyte in a single layer in a single site\" is unreliable, since cross-validation \"only works in points for which the model *already contains data*\" and not at locations distant from known samples.717 In any event, IEMS's cross-validation shows that \"the average difference between known values and predicted values\" is ten times greater than the acceptable error level calculated by Professor Rouhani.718\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 183; Rouhani ER, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 184-185, referring to: IEMS ER4, Att. 36.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 187 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 188; Rouhani ER, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.\n\n371.\n\nMoreover, argues Burlington, IEMS should have engaged in further tests by measuring the correlation of the data and mapping the reliability of the model's predictions through a prediction standard error (\"PSE\") map.719 With respect to data correlation, Professor Rouhani's variograms showed that \"more than half of the model layers\" are not correlated with the result that linear interpolation is unreliable.720 IEMS should also have tested the reliability of its interpolation by generating a PSE map showing \"zones of reliability\" and indicating the range of error within each zone.721 For Burlington, Professor Rouhani's testing of IEMS's model through cross-validation and the use of PSE maps confirmed that the model is not reliable.722\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 190.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 191; Rouhani ER, \u00b6\u00b6 26-28 and Table A.1.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 192.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 193; Rouhani ER, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 69.\n\n**4.4.3 Discussion**\n--------------------\n\n372.\n\nAfter closely reviewing the evidence and the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, as between the methods presented to it, the delineation of discrete pockets of contamination by relying on actual sampling is best suited to estimate the impacted areas and to calculate the volumes of contaminated soil requiring remediation. It therefore discards IEMS's modelling, which it considers unreliable, or at least less reliable, in the circumstances. For various reasons, however, the Tribunal does not rely completely on the results of GSI's delineation exercise and has therefore independently calculated impacted areas and volumes of soil. The Tribunal first provides its reasons for discarding IEMS's modelling ((a) below), then addresses the problems with certain of GSI's delineations ((b) below), before explaining its own approach ((c) below).\n\n**a. IEMS's modelling**\n-----------------------\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal discarded IEMS's modelling for various reasons. In far too many instances there appears to be no reasonable relationship between the model's predictions and the actual data, thus excessively inflating the size of contaminated areas. Among other things, the model does not properly consider clean samples, extends to areas where no sampling was undertaken, and insufficiently takes account of topography and other physical features. In addition, it appears that IEMS did not test the reliability of its conclusions although the ArcGIS user instructions require cross-validation.723 These failings of IEMS's modelling are discussed below.\n\nThe ArcGIS user instructions provide in relevant part: \"Before you produce the final surface, you should have some idea of how well the model predicts the values at unknown locations. Crossvalidation and validation help you make an informed decision as to which model provides the best predictions. The calculated statistics serve as diagnostics that indicate whether the model and/or its associated parameter values are reasonable\". Performing Cross-Validation and Validation, p. 1 (**Exh. CE-CC-439**).\n\n374.\n\nFirst, the Hearing and the Site Visit showed that IEMS's model extends to demonstrably uncontaminated areas. It is common ground among the experts that soil sampling data determine the existence of contamination.724 Burlington rightly pointed to Gacela 4 and Jaguar 3 as examples where clean samples collected by IEMS during its fourth sampling campaign are located in areas that were modelled as contaminated after the first three sampling campaigns, thus disproving the model's predictions.725 IEMS's remodelling of Gacela 4 after the fourth campaign still predicted contamination in areas where new clean samples had been found.726\n\nTr. (Day 3) (ENG), 716:7-12 (Cross, Alfaro); Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1527:12-17 (Cross, Connor).\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 160-164. For Gacela 4 refer to: C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 160-161 and compare IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Gacela 4, p. 17 with Gacela 4\\_Remodeled, Figure 2D (**Exh. E-501**) as well as Gacela 4, Figure 06-B (**Exh. E-499**). For Jaguar 3, refer to: C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 162-163 and compare IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Jaguar 3, p. 17 with Jaguar 3\\_Remodeled, Figure 08-B (**Exh. E-499**).\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 161.\n\n375.\n\nSimilarly, during the Site Visit, the Tribunal observed the absence of correlation of the data included in IEMS's models, in particular at Gacela 2 and Mono CPF. The image of Gacela 2 below shows how IEMS's model predicts contamination extending up and across most of the platform to the north (and beyond) to areas where not a single soil sample had been collected.727 In fact, only one sample taken on the platform \u2013 indicated by the Tribunal with an arrow \u2013 appears to drive the model's predictions (all other samples are to the south or southwest of the platform and lie in lower altitudes than the platform):\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 38, Gacela 2, p. 19. The red area shows IEMS's predictions of contamination above Ecuador's regulatory criteria for sensitive ecosystems under RAOHE Table 6.\n\n376.\n\nIn a comparable manner, the image of Mono CPF below depicts low-lying off platform samples to the east of the platform in the area designated by GSI as Area 2M \u2013 again indicated by the Tribunal with an arrow \u2013 projecting contamination up and across more than a third of the platform although not a single sample was taken on the platform.728\n\nRefer to: IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Mono CPF, p. 29. See also: Tr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG), 88:7-16 (Tribunal, Bianchi at Mono CPF); Video Clip (Day 3), 2:01:09-2:01:42 (Bianchi); C-PSVB, \u00b6 46.\n\n377.\n\nThe pictures above also illustrate that the bounds on IEMS's modelling are determined by clusters of samples and/or discrete samples without considering that large areas inside the bounds have not been sampled at all. Much of IEMS's modelling is thus rather speculative. It also involves a degree of arbitrariness as the models commonly predict that contamination abruptly stops at straight lines.\n\n378.\n\nAs was already mentioned, IEMS's model also fails to sufficiently factor in topography and other physical features of the sites, which is exemplified in the following figure showing Jaguar 7-8. IEMS's model predicts, without supporting sampling data, that contamination spreads east across a creek for approximately 10 meters and uphill for several meters \u2013 indicated by the Tribunal with a yellow arrow \u2013,729 which is contrary to IEMS's own explanation that contamination could conceivably spread uphill some 50 centimetres when the water level rises during the rainy season.730 In addition, IEMS's model ignores GSI's samples on the other side of the creek which show no exceedances.731\n\nJaguar 7-8, Figure 14-B (**Exh. E-499**).\n\nTr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG), 56:1-4 (Tribunal, Chaves at Jaguar 7/8). While the Tribunal might agree with IEMS's explanation that the water level of the creek, and thus also contamination, could rise some 50 centimeters during the rainy season, it does not justify the extension of the model some 10 meters beyond the creek amounting to far more than 50 centimeters height difference.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Tables L.42.3 and L.42.4 for soil confirmation sample JA78-1M-1 and Table L.42.5 for soil delineation samples JA78-1M-3 and JA78-1M-4. See also: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.42.5.\n\n379.\n\nIEMS's modelling at Yuralpa Pad A provides another example of the lack of relation to actual site data. On the basis of a single sample taken next to the oil water separator in the southern corner of the platform (i.e., in the area designated by GSI as Area 2M) \u2013 indicated by the Tribunal with an arrow \u2013 the model predicts that contamination not only spreads downhill to the southeast, but also towards the southwest without any substantiated explanation for this pathway.732 Indeed, there are no IEMS samples showing contamination in that particular area. To the contrary, GSI samples show that the contamination flowed some distance in the southeast direction,733 but that in fact it did not extend to the southwest of the oil water separator.734 This is illustrated by IEMS as follows:735\n\nDuring the Site Visit, IEMS pointed to two potential contamination pathways. First, IEMS mentioned in passing the existence of a river surrounding the platform without providing more specific indications as to the direction of the water flow. Second, IEMS spoke about the structure of the material used to build platforms, which would facilitate the migration of contamination to off platform areas. Tr. Site Visit (Day 1) (ENG), 18:22-19:9 (Tribunal, Chaves at Yuralpa Pad A).\n\nGSI ER1, Att. L.66\\_Yuralpa Pad A, Tables L.66.3 to L.66.5 and Att. A-E, Figure L.66.E.A.1. In particular, GSI sample YUPA-2M-1-(0.0-0.3)R, sample YUPA-2M-1-(0.0-0.3)C Dup, and sample YUPA-2M-3-(0.0-1.0) Dup. The duplicate samples in this case show higher concentrations than the original samples.\n\nGSI ER1, Att. L.66\\_Yuralpa Pad A, Table L.66.5 and Att. A-E, Figure L.66.E.A.1. In particular, GSI sample YUPA-2M-2-(0.0-1.0).\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 38, Pad A, p. 10.\n\n380.\n\nIEMS's predictions for contamination at Coca 15 also demonstrate the flaws of its model. At that site, a single sample with a TPH value purportedly exceeding permissible limits \u2013 signalled by the Tribunal with an arrow \u2013 drives the entire model and predicts contamination in excess of regulatory limits across approximately one-fourth of the platform.736 This is illustrated by IEMS as follows:737\n\nThe Tribunal is concerned here with assessing the reliability of IEMS's model, not on whether any particular sample location has been properly classified under applicable land use criteria. As will be seen further below, this sample (MS-COC-C2-15.3-0.5) has a TPH value of 3,571 mg/kg but shows no exceedance of the correct applicable regulatory criteria, since it is located on the platform and thus must be compared to industrial land use criteria. As stated by Burlington's counsel during the Site Visit: \"So, there's no reason to have the model call for any remediation, and, yet, this site really allows me to illustrate, perhaps, most vividly why this model is so detached from reality and detached from the data. One sample point for a TPH exceedance that is not real drives this red part of the model\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 72:26-31 (Presentation by Ms. Renfroe at Coca 15).\n\nIEMS ER3, Annex C, Coca 15 Corrected, p. 16.\n\n381.\n\nDuring the Site Visit of Coca 15, the Parties' experts disagreed whether the model extended north of the platform where the terrain shows a steep slope upwards.738 While IEMS opined that its model perfectly aligned with topography,739 the Tribunal observes that the red area extends approximately 5 meters beyond the platform (the scale of the map is 1:1000) and thus predicts contamination going up the slope.740\n\nTr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 76:1-30 (Tribunal, Chaves) and 76:31-77:10 (Tribunal, Bianchi).\n\nDuring the Site Visit, IEMS conceded that they did not verify that their bounds aligned to local topography at this particular site, although IEMS thought that this site demonstrated how well its model worked: \"Q: How could the contamination get up there?. A. It doesn't rise. Q: It doesn't rise. Then how does it get here? A. We have a sampling point with TPH values of 3571; the truth is that I hadn't paid attention to that, but, what a good model we made!\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 76:1-8 (Tribunal, Chaves).\n\nAs GSI explained during the Site Visit: \"This is clear evidence of the arbitrariness of how this model works and how it does not consider topography. The model, even if he used it correctly, does not have any input for topography. There is nowhere that you tell it, \"This is higher. This is lower.\" So, we have to dispel that notion that it considers topography. But more than that \u2013 I'm going to hurry. Look at the scale, 1:1000. Every measurement here of one inch would be a thousand inches. This is putting us on the other side. I mean, we can talk about the trees, the clouds, we can talk about anything you want, but this model is on the other side of the slope\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 76:35-77:9 (Tribunal, Bianchi).\n\n382.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that IEMS did not perform any analysis to determine whether its data was spatially correlated.741 It also conceded at the Hearing that it did not conduct a quantitative review to verify the reliability of its model.742 IEMS actually stated that it could not assess the level of precision or imprecision of its model for lack of quantitative analysis743 and admitted being unable to opine whether a 50 percent margin of error would be acceptable.744\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 165-166. IEMS confirmed at the Hearing that it did not engage in any quantitative analysis to test the spatial correlation of its dataset. Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 835:21-836:7 (Cross, Chaves).\n\nDuring cross-examination, IEMS responded as follows: \"Q. And before submitting your Final Report in this case, you did not undertake to evaluate in any quantitative fashion the margin of error or degree of reliability or certainty or uncertainty in your Report, did you? A. Quantitative, no, we didn't conduct a quantitative analysis\". Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 787:20-788:4 (Cross, Alfaro).\n\nTr. (Day 3) (ENG), 788:4-7 (Cross, Alfaro).\n\nIEMS responded as follows during cross-examination: \"Q. I want to focus on the risk that the number you have given this Tribunal of $2.6 billion has a margin of error, has a significant margin of error. And as the Project Manager for this project, and the man who has recommended $2.6 billion of remediation, I'm asking you, sir: Is it acceptable to you for that number to have a 50 percent margin of error? A. Honestly, I don't know if it's acceptable or not acceptable. I am sorry that I'm unable to answer your question\". Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 786:4- 1 4 (Cross, Alfaro).\n\n383.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal observes that Ecuador's other expert, RPS, did not peer review IEMS's model predictions or otherwise test the validity of IEMS's work.745 More importantly, it appears to the Tribunal that, although RPS criticised GSI's sampling methodology (such as using composite samples or sampling at different depths than IEMS), it did not express any principled criticism of GSI's contour delineation.746\n\nRPS testified as follows during cross examination: \"Q. And you're not endorsing the model that they have prepared for this case, are you? A. I have not reviewed the details of the models, no\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1061:14-17 (Cross, Crouch). And further: \"[L]ike I say, I'm not certain of everything IEMS ran. I didn't review all four of their Reports. I looked at what GSI brought forward into their Reports\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1100:9-12 (Cross, Crouch). See also: C-PHB, \u00b6 175.\n\nFor instance, RPS stated the following under cross-examination: \"Q. And so \u2013 and you've provided no criticism of the actual delineation of impacted soils done by GSI at the 17 sites that they identified in their Report? A. No, I think my primary criticisms there were the compositing of the delineation samples \u2013 I guess I offered two criticisms\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1072:8-13 (Cross, Crouch). RPS also criticized GSI more generally for only analyzing for metals and TPH, but not other petroleum chemicals of concern such as BTEX or PAHs. RPS ER2, p. 43. The Tribunal further notes that even IEMS appeared to agree that delineation is a reliable methodology if properly applied: \"When delineation per se is carried out, it can be done in a relatively trustworthy way, but it has to be very well-done\". Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 947:14-16 (Tribunal, Alfaro).\n\n384.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal will not rely on IEMS's modelling. It does not, however, discard the extensive sampling data collected by IEMS. The Tribunal now turns to GSI's delineation approach.\n\n**b. GSI's delineation**\n------------------------\n\n385.\n\nBefore addressing in more detail GSI's approach to delineation (iii), two preliminary issues need to be addressed, namely GSI's indicator parameter theory (i) and GSI's recourse to composite sampling for delineation purposes (ii).\n\n(i) *Indicator parameters*\n--------------------------\n\n386.\n\nGSI only delineated around samples showing TPH or barium exceedances and discarded other heavy metal exceedances as \"background metals issues\", on the ground that such exceedances are unrelated to oilfield operations.747 Ecuador strongly objected to this practice,748 in particular by stressing that Mr. Saltos confirmed that numerous chemicals are used during various phases of the oilfield operations and that Burlington failed to provide a list of the chemicals the Consortium used.749 The Tribunal rejects Burlington's indicator parameter theory for the simple reason that under RAOHE and TULAS *any* exceedances of applicable remediation criteria (adjusted as required to account for higher natural concentrations) in the area of the oilfield operations, warrant remediation by the Consortium, unless Burlington can rely on one of the three exculpatory causes referred to in paragraph 238(iii) above.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 97, 139-141; GSI ER1, pp. 89-92, \u00b6 225 and Exhibits 37-39; GSI ER2, pp. 17-18, \u00b6 45(d).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 69-74; IEMS ER4, pp. 12-14.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 240, referring to: Tr.

(Day 4) (ENG), 1210:5-15 (Cross, Saltos).\n\n(ii) *Composite sampling*\n-------------------------\n\n387.\n\nAnother issue with GSI's approach lies in the use of composite delineation samples. The Tribunal notes that GSI collected discrete risk characterization and soil confirmation samples and that GSI initially started out by collecting discrete delineation samples, only later collecting composite samples since IEMS was projecting contamination in 1-meter layers.750\n\nWhile GSI first took 30 centimeter interval discrete samples, it then resorted to 1-meter interval composite sampling for delineation purposes. GSI explained that prior to its second sampling campaign \"it was discovered that IEMS used discrete sampling intervals to represent full 1 m depth intervals. For example, if an exceedance was detected from 1.2 to 1.5 m, then IEMS assigned that exceedance to the entire 1 to 2 m depth interval. In response, GSI collected composite delineation soil samples [\u2026] from 1-m intervals (i.e., 0.0 \u2013 1.0 m) to provide full lateral delineation. In addition, if the target IEMS sampling location was collected from a portion of a 1m depth interval, then the GSI composite delineation samples were collected from that full 1-m interval\". See: GSI ER1, pp. D.10-D.11. At the Hearing, GSI explained its course of action as follows: \"The goal of our or the objective of our program, was to delineate soil impacts and also to check the IEMS model, and it is true that we began taking these discrete samples and then we switched to taking the 1-meter samples for the purposes of delineation and checking the model\". Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1454:14-19 (Direct, Bianchi). See also: Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 104.\n\n388.\n\nIn addition to various other criticisms raised by Ecuador with respect to composite samples,751 Ecuador notes the risks of dilution and volatilization.752 Ecuador stressed that GSI conceded that 1-meter composite samples are biased towards the lower value since they only show an average and not the highest concentration.753 For these reasons, IEMS did not rely on GSI's delineation samples to compile its models.754\n\nFor instance, Ecuador stated that GSI collected its delineation samples at different depths from IEMS's samples showing contamination. Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 107. Ecuador's expert RPS already raised concerns with respect to GSI's use of composite samples for its risk characterization of mud pits, using Oso 9 as an illustration. RPS ER2, p. 48. RPS stated that GSI's risk characterization samples collected at mud pits at the Oso 9 site were \"two-part composites\". RPS further stated that the use of composite samples led to (i) the loss of VOCs such as TPH, benzene and 1-methylnaphtalene prior to analysis, and (ii) dilution of sample results that are biased low and do not represent the potential concentration of contaminants in the media. According to RPS, \"[i]t is standard risk assessment protocol to collect \"discrete\" rather than \"composite\" samples for determining exposure point concentrations\". RPS further pointed to the EPA's guidance on composite sampling, which provides as follows: \"If the integrity of the individual sample values changes because of compositing, then composite sampling may not be the desired approach. For example, volatile chemicals can evaporate upon mixing of samples or interaction can occur among sample constituents. Another limitation is imposed by potential dilution, when an individual sample with a high value is combined with low values resulting in a composite sample that falsely tests negative\". USEPA, EPA Observational Economy Series, Volume 1: Composite Sampling, EPA/2010/R-95/005, August 1995, p. 5 (RPS ER2, Exh. 30a). See also: RPS Direct Presentation, Slide 14.\n\nEcuador's Closing Statement, Slide 106.\n\nSee, for instance, Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 108, referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1656:12-19 (Tribunal, Bianchi).\n\nDuring the Site Visit, Ecuador explained at Coca 8 why IEMS did not use GSI's delineation samples to model the extent of contamination: \"all of these delineation samples here are composite [\u2026] and explains why GSI results are simply not reliable. They cannot be used. If you were to use that, you will be using wrong data [\u2026] If delineation had been done and they had the choice at the same depth, horizontally, in the same location vertically, we could be talking about delineation, but that's not what they did\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 83:19-24 (Presentation of Mr. Garc\u00eda Represa at Coca 8). See also: R-PSVB, pp. 38-39.\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal need not enter with great detail into the Parties' discussion on composite samples.755 It generally agrees that discrete samples allow for greater accuracy in determining the highest concentration of a contaminant in the soil. There is thus a certain risk of dilution inherent in composite sampling which mixes larger intervals of soil instead of testing thinner intervals. On the other hand, IEMS's 30 centimeter interval samples also involve a degree of composition, merely on a smaller portion. Thus, the Tribunal notes that a certain level of vertical compositing is inevitable for any soil sample.\n\nFor Ecuador's position, refer to: R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 199, 277-287; R-PSVB, \u00b6\u00b6 149-152; Tr.

Rather, RAOHE provides that composite sampling is acceptable.756 RAOHE Annex 5 determines various analytical methods and provides that the method for soil sampling is to collect a \"composite and representative sample\" (\"*Muestra compuesta y representativa*\").757\n\nRAOHE Annex 5 (**Exh. EL-174**). Table 7 of RAOHE Annex 2 also expressly contemplates composite sampling within mud pits. It reads in relevant part: \"The sampling shall be performed so as to obtain representative composite samples as a function of total volume disposed of at the respective site\" (Translation by the Tribunal). See also: GSI ER2, \u00b6 196.\n\nIt then goes on to state as follows: \"a minimum of 15-20 sub-samples per hectare or equivalent, homogenization\" (Translation by the Tribunal). RAOHE Annex 5 (**Exh. El-174**).\n\n391.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal accepts GSI's composite samples in light of the fact that IEMS itself calculated the allegedly impacted areas on the basis of 1-meter layers, the values of which were determined based on samples that ranged from only 10 to 30 centimeters in length.758\n\nGSI provided the following explanation: \"IEMS collected soil samples that typically ranged from 10 to 30 cm in length but assigned the concentration of those samples to the entire 1-meter depth interval of the layer being modeled in their volume calculations. GSI, however, collected soil samples of the full 1-meter length or thickness of the layer being delineated. Consequently, GSI did not have to extrapolate concentrations from a small vertical interval and assume that they applied to a much thicker layer\". GSI ER2, \u00b6 197.\n\n392.\n\nAs to the risk of volatilization referred to above, the Tribunal notes that IEMS did not test its samples for Volatile Aromatic Hydrocarbons,759 and that RPS confirmed that GSI screened its samples with a photo ionization detector (\"PID\") before sending them to the laboratory.760 In any event, the Tribunal is satisfied with GSI's explanation that by the time the sampling took place, these compounds had volatilized to a large extent, since the alleged contamination dated back several years and a key characteristic of these compounds is their high mobility.761\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that IEMS only initially analyzed its samples for PAHs, i.e. compounds which Ecuador's other expert RPS qualified as being pervasive, more toxic and mobile than volatiles, but stopped when it found no exceedances.

(Day 5) (ENG), 1425:18-1426:13 (Direct, Connor).\n\n(iii) *Linear interpolation*\n----------------------------\n\n393.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal now turns to GSI's approach to delineation through linear interpolation. While the Tribunal generally accepts Burlington's delineation methodology, it cannot simply rely on GSI's calculations for several reasons. First, GSI only investigated 22 sites to confirm and delineate the extent of contamination at 74 facilities (of which GSI inspected 58) based on the erroneous assumption that most off platform areas must be evaluated against agricultural land use criteria.762 Consequently, for the contaminated sites for which GSI provided no delineation, the Tribunal will have to undertake its own assessment.\n\nGSI ER1, p. 70. In its second expert report, GSI recognizes that remediation of 37,555 m3 of contaminated soil is required at 17 sites, although it denies that the Consortium caused this contamination. These sites are: Coca 1, Coca 4, Coca 6, Coca 8, Coca CPF, Payamino 1, Payamino 2/8, Payamino 4, Payamino 23, Gacela 1/8, Gacela 2, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 7/8, Mono CPF, Mono Sur and Yuralpa Pad A. See: GSI ER2, p. 24, Exhibit 8 and Table 4; Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1462:22-1463:8 (Direct, Bianchi); GSI's Direct Presentation, Slides 22 and 54. In its first expert report, GSI originally recognized that remediation was warranted at 16 sites, corresponding to 33,415 m3 of total soil volume. See: GSI ER1, p. 88.\n\n394.\n\nSecond, as discussed above (see paragraphs 318-322) for the 17 sites where GSI identified exceedances, GSI's adjusted remediation criteria for certain metals (i.e., barium, cadmium and nickel) have now been found to be incorrect. As GSI conceded under cross-examination, it would have had to delineate around more IEMS samples if the regulatory criteria had been lower than those which it applied.763 Moreover, GSI did not propose alternative delineations considering different regulatory criteria. In other words, GSI's delineation data is insufficient for purposes of the Tribunal's establishement of soil contamination.\n\nGSI responded as follows: \"Q. So, the definition of what an exceedance is is really material, and what I'm putting to you is, if the exceedance threshold is lower, you may be required to delineate around other IEMS samples; correct? A. That is correct. That is possible\". Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1585:9-14 (Cross, Bianchi). And also: \"Q. Now, you recognize, sir, that had you lowered the threshold for an exceedance, there would be more IEMS samples that would need to be delineated around, and some of your own samples may not show clean, and, therefore, you would be required to go even farther to delineate; correct? A. In that hypothetical, yes\". Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1586:3-8 (Cross, Bianchi).\n\n395.\n\nThird, various aspects of GSI's sampling procedure have led the Tribunal to adjust GSI's estimates. In this respect, it may be useful to start by outlining GSI's approach of physical delineation and hand-contouring. GSI first reviewed the laboratory results of soil samples to identify and locate impacted soils.764 It then surrounded these exceedance points with additional soil samples \"until a clean perimeter is defined as needed to delineate the extent of the impacted soils\".765 This \"clean perimeter\" is also referred to as the \"clean margin\".766 It then drew hand contour lines \"by interpolating among the sample points\" (this process is described below), to finally delineate the impacted soil area and its total volume.767 The following image shows the four steps employed by GSI:768\n\nGSI ER2, p. 21.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nSee, for instance: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1588:8 (Cross, Bianchi).\n\nGSI ER2, p. 21.\n\nGSI ER2, p. 22, Exhibit 6.\n\n396.\n\nThe contour lines above (so-called isoconcentration lines) circumscribe the area that fails to comply with the applicable regulatory criteria for one of the indicator parameters tested by GSI, namely TPH or barium, for a given layer of soil depth.769 These contour lines were determined through a combination of one or more of (i) linear interpolation, (ii) physical site features and boundaries (such as edges of pits, platforms, oil-water separators, roads), and (iii) topographic features (such as slopes, streams and catchment areas) and field observations.770\n\nSee, for instance: GSI ER2, Annex D.7.1.4.1 (Coca 8).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n397.\n\nGSI relied on linear interpolation using an equation \"to mathematically locate the isoconcentration contour line between a sampling location that exceeded the specified criterion to a corresponding sampling location that was below the criterion\".771 The interpolated points were indicated on a map using \"tick marks\" and then connected to create an isoconcentration contour line at the specified regulatory criterion for a certain parameter.772 GSI considered site features \"particularly in situations where linear interpolation was not possible\".773 It further explained that \"[f]or selected portions of potentially impacted areas at some sites\", it determined a \"set distance beyond points of exceedance\" based on local topography and field observations where \"linear interpolation was not applicable and/or site features were not available to delineate potentially impacted areas\".774 At the Hearing, GSI acknowledged that the methodology involved a degree of uncertainty in some areas, but that by using professional judgment, providing for additional sampling, and allowing for a contingency factor \u2013 all of which it did \u2013 that uncertainty could be significantly reduced.775\n\nSee, for instance: GSI ER2, Annex D.7.1.4.1 (Coca 8); Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1460:2-16 (Direct, Bianchi).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nSee, for instance: GSI ER2, Annex D.7.1.4.2 (Coca 8).\n\nSee, for instance: GSI ER2, Annex D.7.1.4.3 (Coca 8).\n\nTr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1460:17-1461:14 (Direct, Bianchi).\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal's concerns with GSI's approach can be well illustrated using Coca 8 as an example. Indeed, this could be called the \"poster child\" of Ecuador's critique of GSI's methodology in view of the prominence that it was given at the Hearing. The figure below shows GSI's delineation for barium in the 1-2 meter layer in the area south of the mud pits (located south of the Coca 8 platform).776\n\nGSI ER2, App. D, Figure D.7.1.4.e (Coca 8). See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 359.\n\n399.\n\nAs a first concern, although it does not share Ecuador's criticism that GSI failed to engage in a site-wide assessment,777 especially since the burden to make a showing of harm rests on Ecuador, the Tribunal notes that, as this figure graphically depicts, GSI failed at times to comprehensively collect delineation samples around certain known exceedance points. In the example above, this is the case for instance at: (i) sample location CO08-4M-07 in Area 4M, where no delineation samples were taken to the northwest, west, southwest or south; (ii) sample location CO08-4M-03, where no delineation samples were taken to the northeast, east, southeast, south and southwest; (iii) sample location CO08-4M-04, where no sample was taken to the south; and (iv) sample location CO08-4M-06, where no sample was taken to the west.\n\nSee, for instance: R-PHB, \u00b6 339.\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the fact that the barium value for sample location CO08-4M-07 (770 mg/kg) is close to permissible limit for agricultural use (i.e., 750 mg/kg). The Tribunal nonetheless considers that, as a general matter, and in the light of its own description of its methodology, GSI should have taken additional samples, in particular because GSI purportedly \"stepped out\" of impacted areas to find clean soil.778 This is compounded by the fact that here the applicable criterion is the adjusted sensitive ecosystem limit of 639 mg/kg (see below paragraph 472).\n\nSee, for instance: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1459:13-1460:1 (Direct, Bianchi).\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes GSI's explanation for sample location CO08-4M-03, where the \"potentially impacted area\" was extended by 11 meters southeast since that sample location \"did not have a bounding delineation sampling location or site feature to the east\".779 GSI explained that the 11 meter perimeter was \"a conservative estimate based on the relatively flat localized terrain; therefore, the potentially impacted area was assumed to extend radially an equivalent distance from the GSI exceedance point\".780 However, Professor Rouhani conceded that \"it would have been much easier to solve this problem by just having one more delineation sample\".781 Admittedly, he also concurred with GSI's explanation that practical limitations may militate for using \"professional judgment\" in cases where the results of delineation samples come back from the laboratory with higher than expected values, thus compelling engineers to apply practical approaches instead of relying on purely statistical methods.782\n\nGSI ER2, Annex D.7.1.4.3 (Coca 8).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nTr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1805:16-18 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\nTr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1806:21-1809:1 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\n402.\n\nA second and potentially more problematic difficulty is GSI's resort to linear interpolation combined with its practice, during its stepping-out from exceedance points to locate the clean margin, of putting visually \"dirty\" samples back into the soil without actually testing them in the laboratory. At the Hearing, GSI justified this practice by saying that it was inconsequential to its procedure of \"stepping out\" to find the \"clean margin\", that is, a clean sample that could be interpolated with an exceedance point:\n\n\"Q. Now, leaving aside the conceptually [sic] caveat you put to your answer, in practice, were there instances in which you made a hole in the ground, you looked at the contents of that soil boring \u2013 you took a sample \u2013 and in which you did not submit that sample for laboratory testing? Yes or no.\n\nA. I believe so, yes, if I understood correctly your question. So, we saw evidence of contamination, and we did not submit that sample. Did I understand that correctly?\n\nQ. Right.\n\nA. And the reason for that is because we stepped out because we're looking for the clean margin. So, if we're here and we take the sample \u2013 the exceedance is that monitor there in the middle, and we come here because we believe we're going to be in a clean zone. We look at the sample and like we're not in a clean zone, so that's what I described in my presentation, I think, that we step out. We go further out so that we make sure we include this point, if appropriate \u2013 and that's a key, if appropriate \u2013 within that area\".783\n\nTr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1587:17-1588:16 (Cross, Bianchi). See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 363.\n\n403.\n\nGSI further indicated at the Hearing that this practice was infrequent, pointing to Coca 8 as one instance.784 But Ecuador reviewed GSI's boring logs and pointed to certain other instances785 at Coca 1,786 Coca 6,787 Jaguar 1,788 Mono CPF789 and Payamino 23.790 Generally speaking, the Tribunal has no issue with and accepts using linear interpolation between an exceedance point and a non-exceedance point in order to determine the impacted area based on regulatory criteria. Stepping out looking for clean samples seems appropriate, especially if the clean sample point is taken as the outer limit of the impacted area. However, it also appears to the Tribunal that, as with any methodology, linear interpolation that is based on incomplete data \u2013 in this instance where \"dirty\" borings were not considered \u2013 can distort the results and end up underestimating or otherwise misrepresenting the contaminated area. When linear interpolation between an exceedance point A and a non-exceedance point B is applied, but a \"dirty\" sample C in between is not considered, there is a risk that the contour line is too close to A or otherwise does not reflect the true contours of the contamined area.\n\nGSI stated that it \"can think of Coca 8 as being one example\", further stating that it could not \"recall it happening very often\" and that \"there was very, very few [instances], if more than one\". Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1589:19-1590:6 (Cross, Bianchi).

See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 367.\n\n405.\n\nIn connection with this demonstrative, the following question was put to Professor Rouhani:\n\n\"Q. [\u2026] Now, what I sought to do is I sought to put A and C sort of equidistant from the hand contour line, and you will recall that what we discussed earlier was that, if we had an exceedance that was the same level in excess of the regulatory criteria and a non-exceedance that was the same distance below, or the same volume below, we would arrive roughly in the middle. Now, B, B is our hypothetical exceedance. If B has the same exceedance level as A, and we apply the linear interpolation formula that we have been discussing this evening, and C, the nonexceedance, remains the same level, our tick mark is going to end up further to the east; right? It's going to end up outside the hand contour?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Would you agree with that?\n\nA. Yes\".792\n\nTr. (Day 5) (ENG) 1815:7-1816:2 (Cross, Rouhani).\n\n406.\n\nIn light of the fact that GSI had recourse to this practice in no less than 6 out of 17 sites where GSI delineated impacted areas, the Tribunal cannot but agree with Ecuador that this practice was more systematically used than GSI is willing to concede.793 As discussed above, the Tribunal considers that at certain sites the result of the practice may be to underestimate the contaminated area, in particular where there are no clean samples that define the clean margin in the relevant part of the contour line.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 366.\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal's third concern is that GSI has only delineated areas impacted by its so-called indicator parameters, i.e., barium and TPH.794 As the figure at paragraph 398 above for Coca 8 shows (see also paragraph 471 below), GSI did not delineate areas impacted by what it qualifies as \"background metals issues\" or areas where metal concentrations exceed regulatory limits but no indicator parameter was found. Sample point CO08-4M-05B demonstrates this flaw with respect to its \"background metals\" and indicator parameter approach.\n\nGSI ER1, \u00b6 181(1). GSI explained its indicator parameter theory as follows: \"[For the] characterization of oilfield-related soil impacts, the IEMS soil test results for the primary indicators of oilfield materials (i.e., barium for drilling mud; TPH for crude oil; soil electrical conductance for produced water) were compared to Ecuador regulatory criteria for the relevant land use. The presence of other chemicals in the soil, in the absence of a primary indicator (e.g., nickel in the absence of elevated barium or TPH), *cannot be caused by an oilfield material* and was therefore not retained for further investigation\" (emphasis added). GSI further stated: \"In simple terms, there cannot be an impact by drilling mud, without drilling mud (as indicated by barium), and there cannot be an impact by crude oil without crude oil (as indicated by TPH). The additional chemicals specified in the regulations serve to assess the other constituents (i.e., \u2018the cream') in the spilled material, but they are not reliable to identify the source and/or delineate the spilled material\". GSI ER2, p. 18, \u00b6 45(d).\n\n408.\n\nGSI indicates that sample CO08-4M-05B in the figure at paragraph 398 above, presents a background metals issue in the layer between 1 to 2 meters. Since the nickel value for that sample at that depth is 53 mg/kg, there is an exceedance at that point both under the agricultural and the sensitive ecosystems limits,795 and GSI should have delineated around that exceedance point, which it has not done. Further, this sample location also serves to disprove GSI's indicator parameter theory. Sample CO08-4M-05B in the layer between 1 to 2 meters has a barium value of 310 mg/kg, which is below regulatory limits. However, the barium value in the layer between 0 and 1 meters at that same location is above regulatory criteria (i.e., 830 mg/kg).796\n\nGSI ER2, App. D, Table D.10, p. 1.\n\n*bbid.*\n\n**c. Tribunal's approach to determining the extent of soil contamination**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nHaving determined that it cannot use IEMS's models and that GSI's methodology is affected by certain deficiencies, the Tribunal will now outline its own approach to assess the extent of impacted areas and volumes of contaminated soils. Doing so, the Tribunal relies on all of the elements in the record, including evidence and observations gathered during the Site Visit, which it considers can usefully inform its analysis, in the exercise of its discretion in matters of evidence and quantification of damages.\n\n410.\n\nIn application of the regulatory and land use criteria as set forth in paragraphs 324 and 343 above, the Tribunal starts by determining all exceedance points for a particular site as they arise from the sample results provided by the Parties.797 It then assesses whether the contamination can be attributed (at least partly) to the Consortium, it being recalled that (i) fault is not required, (ii) causation is presumed, the Consortium being exonerated if it proves that the harm was caused by *force majeure*, the victim or a third party (including prior and subsequent operators), and (iii) a finding of fault can lead to the partial attribution of pre-Consortium harm to the Consortium (for instance, with respect to the Consortium's mismanagement of pits built by preceding operators). Where harm is attributed to the Consortium, it then engages in delineating the impacted areas.\n\nSee, for instance: IEMS ER3, Annex C and Annex C Corrected; IEMS ER4, Att. 38; GSI ER1, App. L; GSI ER2, App. D.\n\n411.\n\nFor sites delineated by GSI, the Tribunal adjusts as necessary GSI's impacted areas obtained through linear interpolation by extending them to the next \"clean\" delineation sample (i.e., a sample showing no exceedance under applicable regulatory criteria), where an appropriate \"clean\" sample exists. Where the Tribunal considers that insufficient delineation samples were taken (such as for example in the area in proximity to Coca 8 sample CO08-4M-03 in the figure reproduced at paragraph 398 above), the Tribunal adopts GSI's set distance (for instance, 8 meters at Payamino 23 and 11 meters at Coca 8), if that distance appears sufficiently protective of the environment. Otherwise, the Tribunal extends that distance as it considers appropriate in the light of all of the circumstances.\n\n412.\n\nFor sites not delineated by GSI, the Tribunal seeks to take into consideration all information in the record. Where a number of samples are clustered in a given area, the Tribunal calculates the impacted area on the basis of the scale of the maps, while also considering site features and local topography.\n\n413.\n\nFor sites not delineated by GSI but showing discrete exceedance points, the Tribunal also considers site features and local topography, but mostly applies a set radius around the exceedance point to determine a circular impacted area. The length of the radius depends on various factors, such as the type of contaminant, the level of contamination, the location of the exceedance point, the land use, local topography and proximity to human settlements. Thus, the radius is for instance larger for heavy metals than TPH exceedances due to the increased mobility of the former. The radius is also larger for higher than for lower levels of contamination, or if the exceedance is located in a sensitive ecosystem as opposed to on a platform.\n\n414.\n\nIn general, the Tribunal applies a 5-meter radius for TPH exceedances (amounting to an impacted area of approximately 80 m2) and an 8-meter radius for heavy metal exceedances, including barium (amounting to an impacted area of approximately 200 m2). It considers that these radiuses are adequately protective of the environment. It, however, also takes into consideration that GSI itself sometimes applied slightly larger distances (see, for instance, above paragraph 401; 11 meters at Coca 8, and 8 meters at Payamino 23). As stated above, the radiuses are thus increased as appropriate at certain sites.\n\n415.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal establishes the impacted area for each site. To calculate the volume of contaminated soil, it then multiplies the impacted area by the depth of the contamination, rounding-up the depth to the next meter. Doing so, it seeks to take account of differences in contamination per layer where appropriate. For instance, if the impacted area in the layer between 0 and 1 meter is 200 m2 and the impacted area in the layer between 1 and 2 meters is 80 m2, the total volume of contaminated soil would amount to 280 m3. Where feasible and practicable, the Tribunal calculates total volumes of contaminated soil on the basis of layer-by layer values in an effort to avoid overestimating such volumes.798 However, the Tribunal does not always enter into this level of detail. For instance, where the impacted area of the top layer is smaller than the impacted area in a lower layer (and so, perforce, must be removed and remediated along with the larger contaminated area that lies below), or where the difference of impacted areas between layers is not significant, the Tribunal simply multiplies the largest impacted area by the maximum depth of contamination.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 297. Ecuador's expert IEMS confirmed that its remediation program included remediating clean soil: \"Q.

Burlington screened out various other technologies, mainly because they are ineffective in clayey soils, such as in-situ soil vapor extraction, on site soil washing, bioventing, enhanced biodegradation, or passive remediation.\n\nGSI ER2, App. H, Table H.3.\n\nGSI ER1, App. H, Table H.2. Burlington screened out on site soil washing because it is ineffective in clayey soils.\n\nGSI ER1, App. H, Table H.3.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 412; Rejoinder, \u00b6 197; GSI ER1, \u00b6 246 and App. H, p. 4.\n\n421.\n\nIn addition to inflating the cost for soil treatment and disposal,812 Burlington contends that Ecuador includes unnecessary transportation costs to a transfer station,813 inflates backfilling costs,814 and applies excessive mark ups and contingency.815 Relying on the \"upper-range\" costs of local contractors, Burlington calculates unit costs of USD 80/m3 for off site treatment and disposal (rounded up to USD 100/m3);816 USD 0.40/m3/km for transportation; USD 3/m3 for backfill material; USD 2.50/m3 for excavator rental; and USD 800/day for front loader and bulldozer rental.817 Burlington also includes predesign assessment costs (including for additional soil sampling and testing, as well as travel costs);818 a base cost of USD 20,000 per site for permitting and reporting; and a contingency ranging from 20% (for sites with no potential delineation or access issues) to 30% (for sites with both delineation and access issues).819\n\nGSI ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 144-145.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 146-147.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 148.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 152-153.\n\nBurlington accepts an average reasonable unit cost for excavation, followed by treatment and disposal at an off site remediation facility, of 100 USD/m3. See: Rejoinder, \u00b6 209; GSI ER1, \u00b6 145.\n\nGSI ER1, App. G.2, pp. G.2.6-G.2.7, Exhibit G.2.2 and App. H, pp. H.8-H.9.\n\n*Id*., App. H, Table H.9.\n\n*Id*., App. H, pp. H.11-H.12.\n\n422.\n\nIn total, Burlington calculates an average all-in unit cost for off site landfill disposal of USD 260/m3, which is comparable to and mid-way between the average cost in Europe of USD 303/m3 and in the United States of America of USD 218/m3.820 On that basis, Burlington arrives at a total cost of USD 10,513,000 for the remediation of the 17 sites where it identified exceedances, including closing four open pits and abandoning seven wells821 (although Burlington insists that it is only responsible for remediation at Yuralpa Pad A for USD 110,000 and Jaguar 1 for USD 213,000, in addition to the four pit closures and the seven well abandonments for a total of USD 1,091,000).822\n\nBurlington's Opening Statement, Slide 111.\n\nThe cost for plugging and abandonment of inactive oil wells is estimated by Burlington at USD 100,000 per well. GSI ER1, App. H, p. H.12.\n\nBurlington's Opening Statement, Slides 112 and 116. The Tribunal notes that GSI mentioned an amount of USD 395,000 for the remediation of Jaguar 1, which, in addition to the USD 213,000 for which Burlington accepts liability (Area 3T), includes the remediation costs for the contamination in Area 2M, which Burlington attributes to pre-Consortium activities. See: GSI ER2, Table 4.\n\n**4.5.2 Discussion**\n--------------------\n\n423.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal must decide whether to apply local or international prices. Contrary to Burlington's computations, Ecuador's remediation costs are mostly based on international prices charged by international contractors. Ecuador's expert, IEMS, rejects the use of Ecuadorian contractors because it claims that they are unable to \"provide all of the services required for remediation in compliance with standard[s] which truly protect the environment\"823 and because of the extraordinary amount of remediation under Ecuador's background value case:\n\n\"the reason we didn't choose Ecuadorian contractors, is because the job that we envisaged, that we costed, is a job that has not been done in Ecuador yet [\u2026] It's a job at a level that really has not been done very much in the world. No one has worked those standards before\".824\n\nIEMS ER3, p. 174, note 31.\n\nTr. (Day 3) (ENG), 952:21-953:5 (Tribunal, Green). And further: \"Q. And am I correct that you did not undertake to rely upon local Ecuadorian remediation contractors to develop that estimate? A. That is correct, ma'am. Q. And you didn't develop any local Ecuadorian market information or market price information for remediation of soils in Ecuador to develop that cost estimate, did you? A. That is correct, ma'am\". Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 865:11-19 (Cross, Green). See also: C-PHB, \u00b6 215.\n\n424.\n\nIn fact, the volumes of soil requiring remediation fall significantly below Ecuador's estimates (be it under its background value or its regulatory criteria case). Moreover, the type of remediation activities contemplated here are routinely undertaken in the Oriente region.825 Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason not to use local prices.\n\nSee the updated summary compiled by GSI of key information from environmental remediation projects conducted at oilfield facilities in the Oriente region of Ecuador. GSI ER2, App. B.2.\n\n425.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal must assess whether the remediation must be processed on or off site. Off site remediation appears the more environmentally protective technique. As GSI confirmed, it is indeed used in the Oriente region in about 50% of cases.826 On the basis of the Site Visit and the information on local contractors in the record,827 the Tribunal is satisfied that qualified remediation contractors are available in El Coca and its surroundings which can handle the volumes of contaminated soils off site.828 For these reasons, the Tribunal decides in favor of off site remediation by local contractors.\n\nGSI ER1, App. G.2, p. G.2.5.\n\nGSI ER2, App. B.2.\n\nIn particular, Ecuambiente Consulting Group CIA. Ltda has a 700 hectare treatment and disposal facility nearby the city of El Coca.\n\n426.\n\nThird, as to remediation technology, RAOHE Annex 8, which relates to the treatment of wastes, indicates in its sub-section on non-hazardous wastes, that soils and drillings/cuttings contaminated with crude must be remediated through bioremediation or landfarming.829 The regulations are silent about treatment of heavy metals contamination, but Burlington agrees with Ecuador's view that controlled confinement is the proper technology for soils contaminated with heavy metals (although Burlington favors on site confinement, which the Tribunal rejects for the reasons just mentioned) and that soils contaminated with crude be treated off site, for instance, through bioremediation (whether landfarming, composting or biopiles).830 As to soils contaminated both with TPH and heavy metals, the Tribunal accepts Ecuador's suggestion of off site soil washing, especially in light of the fact that this kind of technology has also been applied by other operators in the Oriente region.831\n\nRAOHE, Annex 8, Section B, items B3001 and B3002 (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\nGSI ER2, App. H, Table H.3.\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.2.\n\n427.\n\nAccordingly, the following remediation technologies appear the most appropriate in the present circumstances: *ex situ* controlled confinement of soils contaminated with heavy metals; *ex situ* bioremediation of soils contaminated with crude; and *ex situ* soil washing for soils contaminated both with crude and heavy metals.\n\n428.\n\nOn that basis and taking into account all relevant facts and evidence in the exercise of its discretion in matters of damage quantification, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that an average all-in unit cost of USD 300/m3 is appropriate in the present circumstances. This unit cost includes all cost items, including pre-design, transportation, additional sampling, backfilling, mark-ups etc, but for a contingency which the Tribunal applies in a range of 20 to 30%. The percentage of the contingency factor depends on whether there are particular remediation challenges in terms of accessibility or exposure issues, such as difficulties in the terrain, larger distances between exceedance points and platform or access road, or proximity to streams and human settlements. Thus, the Tribunal typically applies a 20% contingency to exceedances on platforms and a 30% contingency to exceedance points off platform, unless the latter present no challenges in terms of accessibility or exposure. The all-in unit price used by the Tribunal is applied to volumes of soil as extracted. The Tribunal did not add additional volumes of soil to take account of a possible volumetric expansion, since the all-in unit price already accounts for such expansion.\n\n**4.6 Site review**\n-------------------\n\n**4.6.1 Preliminary remarks**\n-----------------------------\n\n429.\n\nIn application of the standards established above, the Tribunal will now review Ecuador's soil contamination claim site by site. Although Ecuador included in its claim for soil contamination the removal of the mud pits, the Tribunal will address that claim separately.\n\n430.\n\nEcuador investigated a total of 74 sites, sometimes modelling two platforms together.832 IEMS collected a total of 2,950 soil samples to assess the environmental condition in the Blocks, 2,769 in Block 7 and 181 in Block 21.833 Under its regulatory criteria case, Ecuador submits that the impacted area in Block 7 and 21 totals 414,506.14 m2 and that a total of 851,093.75 m3 of soil must be remediated.834 Ecuador's total claim for soil contamination for the regulatory criteria case amounts to USD 790,465,298.835\n\nThis is the case for Gacela CPF and Gacela 1/8, Payamino CPF and Payamino 1, Yuralpa CPF and Yuralpa Pad F, which were modelled together by IEMS. Revised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), lines 21,55 and 68 (**Exh. E-500**).\n\nGSI ER2, Table 2.\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel) (**Exh. E-500**).\n\n*Idid.*\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Ecuador does not claim any soil remediation at Payamino 9, Payamino 13, Payamino 18, Zorro, Yuralpa Pad B, Puerto Napo and Waponi-Ocatoe.836 Neither does it seek soil remedition if regulatory criteria apply at Coca 7, Payamino 6, Payamino 19, Gacela 3, Lobo 2, Lobo 4, Oso 2, Oso 3, Oso A and Yuralpa CPF/Pad F.837 In sum, Ecuador claims for soil remediation at 56 sites.\n\n*Id*., lines 44, 48, 54, 62, 66 and 67 (**Exh. E-500**). This exclusion is explained by the fact that IEMS excluded exceedance points from its modelling exercise in (i) clusters where the values did not exceed background values, (ii) clusters where two sample locations were at a distance beyond 500 meters, and (iii) layers with less than three contaminated samples. See: IEMS ER3, Annex A-8.\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), lines 5, 17, 29, 31,36, 39, 42, 49 and 68 (**Exh. E-500**). For the reasons for not modelling these sites and lEMS's exclusion criteria, see: IEMS ER3, Annex A.8, p. 7.\n\n432.\n\nIn addition to relying on IEMS samples, Burlington's experts from GSI collected an additional 535 soil samples, 482 in Block 7 and 53 in Block 21.838 Burlington disputes any liability for Ecuador's soil remediation claims, although it recognizes that 37,555 m3 of non-pit soil may require remediation for a total cost of USD 9,748,000 at 17 sites.839 Burlington identifies six principal sites, namely Payamino 2/8, Mono 1/CPF, Payamino 1, Gacela 1/8, Coca 8 and Jaguar 1, where more than 1,000 m3 of soil may potentially require remediation.840 Burlington also identifies eleven additional sites that may require remediation of minor quantities of contaminated soil, namely Coca 1, Coca 4, Coca 6, Payamino 23, Coca CPF, Gacela 2, Jaguar 7/8, Mono Sur, Payamino 4 and Yuralpa Pad A.841\n\nGSI ER2, Table 2.\n\n*Id*., Tables 1, 3 and 4.\n\n*Id*., Table 4.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n433.\n\nBurlington acknowledges its liability for the \"reasonable costs of remediating the pockets of exceedances at the two sites that are possibly attributable to the Consortium\", namely USD 323,000 to remediate Yuralpa Pad A and Jaguar Area 3T, since it could not \"definitively link harm to non-Consortium activities\" at those sites.842 In addition, Burlington accepts to pay USD 68,000 to close four open and unused pits (Coca 4, Coca 8 and Payamino 15). Moreover, Burlington accepts to pay USD 700,000 for costs linked to the abandonment of seven platforms (C\u00f3ndor Norte, Gacela 2, Gacela 3, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 7/8, Jaguar 9 and Lobo 4).843 Accordingly, Burlington accepts to pay a total of USD 1,091,000.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 71; GSI ER2, Table 4. Burlington also stated that \"as a responsible member of the Consortium\", it is \"willing to accept liability for the two sites at which it cannot definitively link harm to non-Consortium activities (Yuralpa Pad A and Jaguar 1 Area 3T)\".\n\nGSI ER2, Table 3.\n\n434.\n\nThe Tribunal will now review the circumstances of the 56 sites for which Ecuador claims soil remediation, starting with the sites in Block 7/CPUF (4.6.2) before addressing those in Block 21 (4.6.3). Doing so, it will first address claims for non-pit soil and turn to pit soil in the following section. In this context, the Tribunal notes that GSI states that a number of IEMS samples were in reality taken from pits and/or misplaced by IEMS because of inaccuracies in the assignation of coordinates or in the labelling.844 Taking into account the Parties' and their experts' explanations,845 the Tribunal will decide these matters on a case by case basis where relevant.\n\nSee, in particular: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2; GSI ER2, App. D, Annex D.2.\n\nIn addition to the references in the previous note, see in particular: IEMS ER4, pp. 108-112 and Tables 2 and 3.\n\n**4.6.2 Block 7/CPUF**\n----------------------\n\n**a. Coca 1**\n-------------\n\n435.\n\nEcuador submits that the impacted area in Coca 1 covers an area of 12,960 m2 and it claims for remediation of 16,848 m3 of soil, for a total cost of USD 15,232,093.846 Although Burlington disputes that the Consortium caused any exceedances at Coca 1, it accepts that there is contamination at that site covering 520 m2 in Area 1MT and 70 m2 in Area 2T (see figure in paragraph 437).847\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 1 (**Exh.

Considering the depth of the exceedances (up to 2.6 meters) and the fact that there is no pit at Coca 1, it finds that contamination in Area 1MT is associated to drilling activities and was thus caused by prior operators. Burlington has thus succeeded in rebutting the presumption of causation with respect to the contamination found in that area. By contrast, Burlington failed to convincingly rebut the presumption that it caused the TPH exceedance in Area 2T.\n\n441.\n\nGSI applied linear interpolation to calculate the impacted area,858 placing certain dirty borings back into the soil during its stepping out procedure859 \u2013 although the Tribunal notes that GSI's delineation samples bear relatively low TPH levels.860\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Table L.1.E.1 and Figure L.1.E.A.1.\n\nGSI Log Book for sample CO01-2T-02, 29 February 2012, p. 1; GSI Log Book for sample CO01-2T-02, 3 March 2012, p. 1 (**Exh.

GSI only tested for TPH in Area 2T.\n\n442.\n\nOn that basis and in accordance with the guidelines established above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2 above), the Tribunal determines that 200 m2 in Area 2T are impacted. Since remediation is required up to 2 meters depth, the total volume of contaminated soil amounts to 400 m3, for a cost of USD 120,000. Adding a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428 above), the total cost for which Burlington is liable amounts to **USD 144,000** for Coca 1.\n\n**b.

It is nonetheless noteworthy that the 2006 biennial audit identified a non-conformity with respect to wastewater discharges.880 It is further of particular relevance that, between 1989 and 1996, Petroproducci\u00f3n permanently discharged produced water, without skimming the oil, into the environment from the pits to the south of the CPF into the creek flowing southeast towards the Chal\u00e1 swamp where Area 2T is located.881\n\nThe following spills have been recorded: 20 bl crude spill on 1 January 1994 at transfer pump (Petroproduccion), of which 16 bl were recovered; 2 bl crude spill on 26 December 1994 (Oryx) at tank, of which 1 bl was recovered; 4 bl crude spill on 1 March 1996 at transfer pump (Oryx), none of which was recovered; 3 bl crude spill on 11 May 1996 at power oil line (Oryx), of which 1 bl recovered; 4 bl condensate spill on 25 May 1996 at API separator (Oryx), none of which was recovered; 4 bl crude spill on 26 June 1996 at Monarch2 separator (Oryx), none of which was recovered; 40 bl crude spill on 15 September 1996 at Manifold separation line (Oryx), of which 30 bl recovered; 30 bl crude spill on 25 September 1996 at separators (Oryx), which was all recovered; 10 bl crude spill on 18 February 1997 at Monarch separator (Oryx), all of which was recovered; 40 bl crude spill on 19 February 1997 at Production Separator Gas Burner (Oryx) of which 4 bl were recovered; 20 bl crude and production water spill on 20 February 1997 at Monarch2 Separator (Oryx), none of which was recovered; and 20 bl crude spill on 5 June 2000 at power oil unit (Kerr McGee), of which 19 bl were recovered.

The following is stated in a 1994 environmental assessment prepared for Oryx: \"The produced water is gravity discharged from a pipe approximately 200mm in diameter to two lined earthen retention ponds for disposal into a natural drainage channel. No oil skimming equipment is in place within the pond system. An oil collection system comprised of a series of weirs made of palm leaves is utilized within the drainage channel. The oil is manually skimmed from the pools created by the weirs. The output of the weirs flows down the hillside into a creek which flows into the Rio Huashito. The system has been successful in the collection of oil; however, floating oil is still lost into the creek. Oil contaminated material is stored adjacent to the channel and requires regular disposal\".

Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 141:2-15 (Presentation by Ms. Renfroe at Coca CPF).\n\n449.\n\nWhile Mr. Saltos indicated that Oryx discontinued this practice and the area was remediated in 1997,882 he also stated that oil seeping continued thereafter, and that this state of affairs persisted during the Consortium's operatorship, and that the Consortium did not reach an agreement with Mr. Chal\u00e1 because of the takeover in 2009.883 Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that the Consortium is partially responsible for the environmental condition in the Chal\u00e1 swamp. In the exercise of its discretion in matters of the quantification of damages, it determines that Burlington shall pay 50% of the remediation costs.\n\nSaltos WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 297-298.\n\nMr. Saltos stated the following: \"Unfortunately, it continued discharging water from the API separator, and this water may have had traces of hydrocarbons that ended up in the swamp. And, logically, they continued to go through the swamp until they reached Chal\u00e1. And that area, as it is lower lying, and cannot pass directly to the other side of the road, would become sedimented and contamination accumulated there. When I lived in Chal\u00e1, we tried to reach an agreement with Chal\u00e1, we tried, with him, to carry out a remediation project. Unfortunately, 2009 came and we could not execute it. That's how it was\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 139:17-23 (Tribunal, Saltos at Coca CPF).\n\n450.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal sees no elements in the record to rebut the presumption that Burlington caused the contamination at the other exceedance points mentioned in paragraph 447. Therefore, Burlington is liable to pay the full costs of remediation of these other areas.\n\n451.\n\nWith respect to Area 2T in the Chal\u00e1 swamp, two additional difficulties arise. In this context, it is useful to refer to GSI's impacted area designation in the Chal\u00e1 swamp:884\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.2.8.\n\n452.\n\nThe first difficulty in connection with the Chal\u00e1 swamp relates to the Parties' disagreement on the location of IEMS's sample points in the swamp. Ecuador indicates that IEMS sampled south of the culvert,885 whereas Burlington argues that IEMS sampled north of the culvert.886 The issue was discussed during the Site Visit. While IEMS reiterated that it sampled south of the culvert,887 GSI explained that IEMS did not use a GPS but a tape measure to locate its samples and that one point was missed causing a discrepancy of 100 meters.888 In addition, GSI stated that it found no indication of sampling to the south of the culvert, that GSI itself took verification samples there and found no exceedances, and that TPH exceedances in fact exist to the north of the culvert where GSI sampled.889 On that basis, GSI argues that \"both the geographic and the soil data tell us that we were in the right location\".890\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the maps provided by IEMS in its third and fourth reports indicate sample locations south of the culvert: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Coca CPF corrected, p. 38; IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Coca CPF, p. 46.\n\nGSI ER1, pp. 53-54 and App. D, Annex D.2, p. 14. GSI explained that on the one hand, IEMS Annex I locates these samples south of the culvert, whereas the IEMS GIS database places these samples north of the culvert. GSI therefore relied on the GIS database, since these locations match the locations plotted in IEMS's second report and the site features in the swamp. See also: Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 155:3-14 (Tribunal, Connor at Coca CPF); C-PSVB, \u00b6 33, note 79. See further: GSI field notes, forms, maps and checklists of GSI Environmental \u2013 Second campaign (produced by Burlington on 14 November 2012), JAC Field Notes Redacted, pp. 17-18 (**Exh.

Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 155:19-20 (Tribunal, Connor at Coca CPF).\n\n453.\n\nBecause IEMS did not use state of the art (and in fact commonly used) technology to locate its samples, the Tribunal is inclined to rely on GSI's location. Further, the Tribunal notes that GSI places IEMS's samples where the creek flowing from the API separator reaches the swamp area.891 Accordingly, the Tribunal will work on the basis of GSI's locations for IEMS samples.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.2.3.\n\n454.\n\nThe second difficulty relates to the fact that Petroamazonas built a pipeline in Area 2T after IEMS collected its samples in 2012.892 Because the right of way built by Petroamaonas partly passes through Area 2T, the Tribunal discarded from its analysis various sample locations, the remediation of which was superseded by the construction of the pipeline.893\n\nSee, for instance: C-PSVB, \u00b6 14.\n\nThe Tribunal discards the following samples: 07-CPFCO-SEM18-R, 07-CPFCO-SEM21-R and 07-CPFCO-SEM22-R. Because the Tribunal does not have the exact location of the right-of-way, and because in the doubt the burden falls on Burlington, the Tribunal maintained in its analysis the following samples: 07-CPFCO-SEM13-R and MS-COC-C2-CPF.2-0,5. The Tribunal stresses that the same approach would have been adopted by the Tribunal if it had considered IEMS's samples to be located south of the culvert, since the right of way also traverses that area.\n\n455.\n\nOn that basis and applying the guidelines set out earlier (section 4.4.3.c and in particular paragraph 414), the Tribunal determined the following impacted areas: 480 m2 in Area 2T,894 200 m2 for the cadmium exceedance southwest of the pit area and 200 m2 for the cadmium exceedance north of the API separator, for a total impacted area of 880 m2. The total soil volume is 1,480 m3: 480 m3 in Area 2T, 400 m3 for the cadmium exceedance southwest of the pit area and 600 m3 for the cadmium exceedance north of the API separator.\n\nThe Tribunal determined the impacted areas as follows: 150 m2 around sample MS-COC-C2-CPF.2-0,5 due to the high TPH level; 100 m2 around sample 07-CPFCO-SEM09-R(0,0-0,3)m due to the high TPH level and the site features of the swamp; 80 m2 around sample 07-CPFCO-SEM13-R(0,0-0,3)m due to the relatively low TPH level; and 150 m2 around samples 07-CPFCO-SEM2-R(0,0-0,5)m, 07-CPFCO-SEM4-R(0,5-1,0)m, 07-CPFCO-SEM4-R(0,0-0,3)m, 07-CPFCO-SEM5-R due to the high TPH level of sample SEM5.\n\n456.\n\nIn application of the Tribunal's approach explained above (section 4.5.2) and adding a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428 above), the remediation cost for Area 2T is USD 187,200, of which Burlington must bear **USD 93,600**. Adding a 20% contingency to the cadmium exceedances, the remediation cost for these locations is **USD 360,000**. Accordingly, Burlington is liable to pay **USD 453,600** for soil remediation at Coca CPF.\n\n**c. Coca 4**\n-------------\n\n457.\n\nEcuador submits that the impacted area in Coca 4 extends over 2,732 m2 and claims the remediation of 3,551.60 m3 of soil, for a total cost of USD 3,617,276.895 Although Burlington disputes that the Consortium caused any exceedances at Coca 4, it accepts that there is contamination in Area 1M extending 20 m2 for a total remediation cost of USD 72,000, but argues that this was caused by pre-Consortium drilling activities.896\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 3 (**Exh.

In any event, the Tribunal observes that the satellite imagery of 2010 suggests that secondary forest surrounded the platform and that land use changes have therefore occurred thereafter.

Accordingly, Burlington is liable to remedy all exceedances at Coca 4.\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.5; GSI ER2, App. B.5; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 4 (**Exh.

Adding a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428 above), the total remediation cost for which Burlingtom is liable amounts to **USD 226,200** for Coca 4.\n\nSee GSI's interpolation tick marks: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.3.E.A.1.\n\nFor the location of the nickel exceedances, see: GSI ER2, App. D, Figures D.1.11 and D.5.8.\n\n**d.

GSI ER1, App. L, Tables L.4.1, L.4.3, L.4.4, L.4.5; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 3-5. The precise location of sample 07-COC06-SEH2-(0,0-0,3)m is unclear, since there are no coordinates (no easting and northing) and is otherwise not located on GSI's maps. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.4.3. However, since all samples with the reference \"SEH\" (for instance, SEH1, SEH3, SEH4) are located in the swale of Area 1MT, the Tribunal worked on the assumption that sample SEH2 is also located there.\n\n467.\n\nCoca 6 was drilled by CEPE in 1989, but the well was shut in by the Consortium.916 Burlington links all exceedances to a spill that occurred in 1999.917 However, Ecuador demonstrated that the Consortium conducted a well workover at that site involving drilling and the use of chemicals, which could also be the cause of heavy metal exceedances.918 The Tribunal further notes that there was a spill in 2006 and another one of 10 barrels in 2007.919 In addition, GSI stated that a remediation program was in place when the Consortium took over the operations, but that it was never completed due to unsuccessful negotiations with local communities to gain access to the stream area.920 In light of the fact that the Consortium assumed the remediation program for the 1999 spill, but that it failed to conduct the remediation, and considering the 2002 workover and the 2006 and 2007 spills, the Tribunal holds the Consortium fully responsible for the environmental condition in Area 1MT.\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.5; GSI ER2, App. B.5; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 5 (**Exh.

The Tribunal also notes that Mr. Note\u00f1o, President of the community of *Coraz\u00f3n del Oriente,* filed a complaint in 2006, which, however, appears to relate to the pits to the north of the platform, not to the exceedances in Area 1MT.

Since GSI's delineation does not include all exceedance points in Area 1MT,921 and in light of the high TPH values reaching the creek to the southeast of the swale, the Tribunal determined the impacted area to extend to 1,100 m2 and the total volume of soil to be remediated to amount to 1,100 m3. Considering a contingency of 30% (see paragraph 428 above), the remediation cost amounts to **USD 429,000** for Coca 6.\n\nSee: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.4.8.\n\n**e.

In the Area 1M, the impacted area is 210 m2 and the volume of soil 210 m3. See: GSI ER2, Tables 3 and 4. In its first report, GSI estimated the impact area at 280 m2, the volume of contaminated soil at 280 m3, and the total cost of remediation at USD 167,000. See: GSI ER1, App. L.6.1, p. 5, Att.

For a depth-integrated potentially impacted area calculated by GSI, see: *Id*., Figure D.4.1.\n\n472.\n\nThere are various land uses around Coca 8. With reference to the Tribunal's approach explained above (section 4.3.2.c), the platform falls within the industrial land use criteria. The area northwest of the platform, along the entry road is used for agricultural purposes. All other areas surrounding the platform are properly classified as sensitive ecosystem.930 Applying these criteria, there are no exceedances on the platform and no exceedances to the north of the platform.931\n\nGSI concedes that secondary forest is immediately adjacent to the platform, with agriculture 50 meters to the north, 100 meters northwest and 120 meters to the south. GSI ER1, App. L.6.1, p. 6. The Tribunal did not give much weight to the statement in 2007 of the landowner Mr. Note\u00f1o, that the lands around the platform were destined for agriculture, in light of the explanation by Mr. Saltos that the areas immediately surrounding the platform cannot be used by private owners while oilfield operations are ongoing: \"In addition, this area over here is not used because compensation was paid previously by the private company for the operation of the platform. And while the operation of the platform is ongoing, they cannot use it\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 107:1-3 (Tribunal, Saltos at Coca 8).

See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.6.3; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, p. 9.\n\n473.\n\nFurther, applying the sensitive ecosystem criteria to the other areas, the Tribunal identified numerous barium, cadmium and nickel exceedances in the area visited by the Tribunal south of the three mud pits bordering the southern edge of the platform, which includes the areas designated by GSI as Area 4M, immediately adjacent to the mud pits, and Area 1M further downhill.932 The highest barium level reaches 23,368.3 mg/kg at the sample location 7-COC-08-TE-104P.933 In addition, there are various barium, cadmium and nickel exceedances to the west of the platform and the pit area.934\n\nIEMS samples with exceedances are the following: 7-COC-08-TE-102(0.5-0.7), 7-COC-08-TE-102(1.5-1.7), 7-COC-08-TE-102(2.0-2.2), 7-COC-08-TE-103(0.5-0.7), 7-COC-08-TE-103(1.4-1.6), 7-COC-08-TE-104-(0.5-0.7), 7-COC-08-TE-104(0.5-0.7)P, 7-COC-08-TE-104(1.2-1.4)P, 7-COC-08-TE-104-(1.50-1.70), 7-COC-08-TE-105-(0.5-0.70), 7-COC-08-TE-105-(1.50-1.70), 7-COC-08-TE-106-(0.5-0.70), 7-COC-08-TE-106-(1.50-1.70), 7-COC-08-TE-108-(0.5-0.70), 7-COC-08-251-MS-A-0,5, 7-COC-08-251-MS-B-0,2, 7-COC-08-251-MS-B29, 7-COC-08-251-MS-F-0,5, 7-COC-08-251-MS-H-0,5, 7-COC-08-251-MS-H-1,5, 7-COC-08-251-MS-I-0,5, 7-COC-08-251-MS-I-1,5.

The Consortium was made aware of this situation at the latest in March 2007 when Mr. Note\u00f1o, the President of the *Coraz\u00f3n de Oriente* community, filed a complaint.938 The record does not show that the Consortium took action to mitigate the harm and prevent it from spreading further.939 As a result, the Tribunal finds that Burlington shares a responsibility for this damage and must accordingly contribute 50% to the cost of remediating it. This applies to the area south and west of the pits. By contrast, the two barium exceedances to the west of the platform are unrelated to the condition of the pits at issue and are, therefore, not attributable to Burlington.940\n\nLetter of 22 March 2007 from the President of the Coraz\u00f3n del Oriente Community to Salvadore Quishpe (**Exh.

For instance, sample 7-COC-08-TE-102 was included in Area 4M, and the Tribunal took into consideration that most sample locations have exceedances extending to a depth of 2 meters, including the nickel exceedance at sample point CO08-4M-05B and the cadmium exceedance at sample point 7-COC-08-TE-103. In addition, the Tribunal extended the impacted area to the west of sample point CO08-4M-07 by 8 meters. On that basis the Tribunal extended the impacted area to 2,600 m2 and the total volume of soil to 5,200 m3. In Area 1M, the Tribunal extended GSI's delineation around sample 7-COC-08-251-MS-B from 110 m2 to an impacted area of 200 m2 and a total volume of soil of 200 m3. It also slightly extended the area around sample CO08-1M-1B from 90 m2 to 120 m2, corresponding to 120 m3 of contaminated soil, to factor in the fact that GSI put dirty borings back into the ground at Coca 8. See: R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 363365. Finally, the impacted area around sample 7-COC-08-251-MS-H was significantly expanded from 10 m2 to 350 m2 and a volume of soil of 700 m3, in order to factor in the numerous additional cadmium exceedances (7-COC-08-251-MS-I, 7-COC-08-TE-104, 7-COC-08-TE-105, 7-COC-08-TE-106, 7-COC-08-TE-108).\n\nIn accordance with the information in the previous note, the Tribunal determined an impacted area of 2,600 m2 and a total volume of soil of 5,200 m3 in Area 4M, and an impacted area of 670 m2 and a total volume of soil of 1,020 m3 in Area 1M.\n\n477.\n\nThe exceedance points to the west of the pits make up five discrete impacted areas of 1,000 m2 in the aggregate (200 m2 each) and a total volume of 1,000 m3 of soil to be remediated,943 for a total cost of **USD 390,000** with a contingency of 30% (see paragraph 428).\n\nSamples 07-COC08-SEI05-R(0,0-0,3)m, 7-COC-08-254-MS-B-0,5, 7-COC-08-254-MS-C-0,5, 7-COC-08-254-MS-D-0,5, 7-COC-08-254-MS-F-0,5.\n\n478.\n\nThe exceedance next to the oil/water separator impacted an area of 80 m2 and requires remediation of 160 m3, for a cost of **USD 57,600** that includes a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428).944\n\nSamples 7-COC-08-254-MS-A and 7-COC-08-254-MS-A24.\n\n479.\n\nTo conclude, the total impacted area in Coca 8 is 4,350 m2; the total volume of soil to be remediated is 7,380 m3; and the total cost of remediation of regular soil at Coca 8 amounts to USD 2,873,400, of which Burlington shall bear 50%, totalling **USD 1,436,700**.\n\n**f. Coca 9**\n-------------\n\n480.\n\nEcuador submits that an area of 7,511 m2 is impacted at Coca 9 requiring the remediation of 16,789.50 m3 of soil, for a total cost of USD 16,772,147.945 For its part, Burlington argues that no remediation is called for at this site, since there are no exceedances of any indicator parameters and the vanadium exceedance on the northwestern corner of the platform is a \"background metals issue\".946\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 7 (**Exh.

There are no records of historical spills at that site.950 In its preliminary assessment, IEMS identified discoloration of the floor in the northwestern corner of the platform and signs of contamination in a marshy area located at the southeast corner of the platform.951 The 2008 audit mentioned the lack of labelling of fuel tanks and chemical products, the lack of signage concerning industrial safety or the handling of chemicals, the lack of maintenance of the perimeter ditch, the unmarked oil well, and the accumulation of loose materials on the platform.952 While these facts are not evidence of environmental harm, they suggest faulty conduct, which reinforces a finding of a causation. In light of these facts and of Burlington's argument described above, Burlington cannot be held to have rebutted the presumption that the Consortium caused the harm found at that site.\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 38, Coca 9, p. 1; GSI ER1, App. B.4 and B.5.\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 38, Coca 9, p. 5; GSI ER1, App. B.3.\n\nSee: RECs No. 7-COC-09-60 and 7-COC-09-61.

In reliance on its methodology explanined above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal calculated an impacted area of 200 m2 and a volume of soil to be remediated of 400 m3, for a total cost of **USD 144,000** which includes a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428).953\n\nSample 7-COC-09-61-MS-B-1,5.

Compare with: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Coca 18/19, p. 20; IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Coca 18/19, p. 21.\n\nGSI ER1, Table 4.\n\nGSI ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n\n496.\n\nThe following figures show IEMS's981 and GSI's982 sampling locations at Coca 18/19:\n\n*Id*., App. D, Figure D.5.6.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.13.5.\n\n497.\n\nCoca 18 was drilled by Kerr McGee in July 2001 and Coca 19 by Perenco in December 2003.983 As will be discussed in the analysis of mud pits, when the Consortium drilled the Coca 19 well in 2003, it deposited drilling wastes in four pits adjacent to that well and in two auxiliary pits located just beyond the southwestern corner of the platform, the latter two corresponding to Area 1M.984 Therefore, the Tribunal will address the content of the auxiliary pits as part of its analysis of mud pits.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, lines 13-14 (**Exh.

See also: GSI ER2, App. B.3.1.\n\n498.\n\nIn addition to alleged exceedances in Area 1M, the Tribunal identified one barium exceedance on the platform next to the Coca 18 well.985 While that well was drilled by Kerr McGee in 2001, the Tribunal notes that the Consortium conducted some workovers at that well.986 It, therefore, holds the Consortium liable to remediate that exceedance. In application of its methodology (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), it admits an impacted area of 80 m2987 and a volume of 80 m3, for a total cost of **USD 28,800** for Coca 18/19, taking into account a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428).\n\nSample 7-COC-18-273-MS-A-0,5m.

Payamino 1 and CPF**\n-------------------------\n\n500.\n\nEcuador claims USD 44,642,039 to remediate Payamino 1/CPF, where it contends that an area of 36,613 m2 is impacted and that 50,659.70 m3 of soil need to be remediated.989\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 55 (**Exh. E-500**). Compare with: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Payamino 1, p. 18 and Payamino CPF, p. 27; IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Payamino 1, p. 17 and Payamino CPF, p. 31.

According to Burlington, remediating the 800 m3 of potentially contaminated soil would cost no more than USD 243,000.994 Burlington also accepts that 210 m3 of soil potentially require remediation in Area 2MT for a total cost of USD 64,000.995 Finally, Burlington rejects all other claims for remediation in Payamino 1/CPF, in particular by arguing that IEMS samples in Area 3MT are in reality misplaced and were taken from Payamino 2/8.996 With respect to the sample collected close to the exhaust stack of a diesel-powered compressor at Payamino CPF,997 GSI opined that less than 20 liters (0.02 m3) of soot were collected \"as a thin film on the ground surface\" and that the soils beneath were clean.998 This does not, in Burlington's eyes, justify a claim of over USD 5 million to remediate 5,373 m3 of soil.\n\nGSI ER2, Table 4.

It was drilled by BP in 1986 and evidence suggests that 13 workovers were conducted at that well between 1991 and 2005, including by the Consortium.999 The Payamino 1 well is located north and approximately 30 meters downhill of the CPF, which was put in operation between 1991 and 1992.\n\nGSI ER1, p. 101. See further: Well Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Payamino 1 Reacondicionamiento # 12, March 2005, Reacondicionamiento # 13, May 2005, Reacondicionamiento # 14, June 2007 (**Exh. E-573**).\n\n505.\n\nBefore addressing the off platform exceedances in the areas designated by GSI as Areas 1P, 2MT and 3MT, the Tribunal will address the on platform exceedance of TPH (5,138 mg/kg) adjacent to the diesel-powered compressor at the CPF.1000 Since Petroamazonas operated the compressor after the takeover without addressing that situation, the Tribunal deems it correct to apportion the liability between the Consortium and its successor and, in its discretion in assessing the evidence and quantifying damages, finds that Burlington shall bear 50% of the remediation costs. Because the impacted area appears to be localized, the Tribunal determines that remediation of 30 m3, for a total cost of USD 10,800 including a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), is adequate and reasonable. Burlington shall thus pay 50% of that cost, i.e. **USD 5,400**.\n\nSamples 7-PAY-CPF-N2-MS-B-0,5 and 7-PAY-CPF-N2-MS-B23.\n\n506.\n\nTurning now to off platform locations, it is undisputed that sensitive ecosystem land use criteria apply to areas surrounding Payamino 1/CPF, notably because this site is part of a designated protected area under the SNAP system (see section 4.3.2.c above).1001 On that basis, the Tribunal identified two TPH exceedances in Area 1P1002 and various TPH and barium exceedances in Area 2MT.1003 In light of the fact that IEMS confirmed that it mislabeled samples 07-PAY28-SDB3-R and 07-PAY28-SDB4-R and that they were indeed collected in Area 3MT at Payamino 1/CPF,1004 the Tribunal finds that TPH and barium contamination has been shown also in Area 3MT.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 284; Map of Sites in Blocks 7 and 21 that Intersect Protected Areas, 2012 (**Exh. CE-CC-266**).\n\nSamples 07-PAY01-SDC3-R(1,2-1,3)m and MS-PAY-C1-1.2-0,5. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.14.1; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 22-24, 43-46.\n\nIEMS samples with TPH exceedances are: 07-PAY01-SDA1-R(0,6-0,8)m and 7-PAY-CPF-166-MS-Q-0,5. IEMS samples with barium exceedances are: MS-PAY-C2-1.1-0,5 and 7-PAY-CPF-166-MS-SA-0,2. GSI samples with TPH exceedance are: PACPF-2MT-01-0.0-0.3 See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.14.1; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 22-24, 43-46.\n\nIEMS ER4, pp. 109-110 and Table 3.\n\n507.\n\nIn light of the fact that Area 1P hosted a former concrete produced water basin that was remediated in 1999 and then removed in 2001,1005 that this basin was above ground, that a concrete layer now covers the TPH exceedance points, the Tribunal is of the view that the exceedances were not caused by the Consortium but are liabilities of prior operators. Accordingly, Burlington is not liable for the condition of Area 1P.\n\nGSI explained the following: \"Area 1P, located directly south of the well platform, corresponds to the former location of aboveground concrete basins used for management of produced water from 1996 to 1999. Residual petroleum found in subsurface soils at this location is potentially associated with leakage from the base of these former basins, which were removed from service by 1999 and demolished in 2001. Soil test results indicate that the elevated TPH levels are present beneath only a portion of the former footprint of the produced water basins\". GSI ER1, p. 101.\n\n508.\n\nThe situation is the opposite as concerns the catchment area labelled Area 2MT, which appears to be a workover pit located some 120 meters southwest of the Payamino 1 platform in the proximity of the River A\u00f1ango. This pit was unreported and thus served as a concealed location to dump industrial wastes in the middle of a protected area adjacent to a water body. GSI indicated that 13 workovers had been conducted at Payamino 1 until 2005, including by the Consortium,1006 which Mr. Saltos confirmed.1007 GSI opined that it was unable to determine the cause of the exceedances in Area 2MT.1008 Neither Burlington nor its key witness, Mr. Saltos, appeared to dispute that the Consortium used that workover pit. Accordingly, the Tribunal holds Burlington liable to remediate Area 2MT. By reference to the methodology set out above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the impacted area is 500 m2,1009 the total volume of soil 500 m3, for a total cost of **USD 195,000**, which includes a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).\n\nGSI ER1, App. K. See also: Payamino \u2013 1 Well History (**Exh. E-245**). In particular, the Consortium conducted workover # 13 on 9 April 2005 to perforate in the Napo \"U\" reservoir. Well Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Payamino 1, Reacondicionamiento # 13, May 2005 (**Exh. E-573**).\n\nMr. Saltos responded as follows at the Hearing: \"Q. In Payamino 1, because of the age of the well \u2013 A. Yes, many, many workovers\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1228:5-7 (Cross, Saltos). For Mr. Saltos' testimony on Payamino 1 workovers, see also: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1226:8-1235:12 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nGSI indicated the following: \"Consequently, the date of construction and use of this apparent workover pit is unknown, based upon currently available information\". GSI ER1, \u00b6 271(3).\n\nGSI calculated a total impacted area of 210 m2, including 110 m2 within the catchment area, corresponding to a little more than half its size, and an additional 100 m2 outside the area to remediate the TPH exceedance at sample location 7-PAY-CPF-166-MS-Q. The Tribunal holds that the entire catchment area must be remediated, amounting to 200 m2, and further increased the impacted area outside to catchment area from 100 m2 to 300 m2, in order to remediate the entire northern flank outside of the catchment area.\n\n509.\n\nFinally, Burlington argues that the samples showing TPH exceedances in Area 3MT were mislocated, but does not provide an alternative explanation as to the possible cause of these exceedances. Further, the spill record for Payamino CPF, including the area formerly known as Payamino 22, both of which overlook Area 3MT, reveals numerous spills during the Consortium's operations, including an oil runoff from Payamino 22 in 2002, a 0.1 barrel crude spill in 2004,1010 a 2.4 barrel crude oil spill on 2 January 2007,1011 an unreported spill of contaminated fluids on 1 October 2007 affecting the API separator, perimeter drains and the A\u00f1ango River,1012 a 6.28 barrel crude spill on 6 October 2007 affecting the River A\u00f1ango,1013 and a 2009 crude spill some 10 meters away from the CPF along the Payamino 19 flowline.1014 These facts support a determination that the exceedances were caused during the Consortium's operatorship, which Burlington has not rebutted. This view is reinforced if one looks to the definition of \"affected areas\" in the settlement agreement of 11 May 2010 between Mr. Jungal, Ms. C\u00e1rdenas Hern\u00e1ndez and the Consortium, which includes \"landslides on the slope of well Payamino 22\" and \"erosion and sliding of the slope at Payamino Station\".1015\n\nSol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6 76, item 2 and Annex 40 (Internal report).\n\nReply, \u00b6 135, item d; GSI ER1, App. B.3, line 85.\n\nSol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6 76, item 13 and Annex 51 (Internal spill report of 1 October 2007).\n\nReply, \u00b6 135, item f; GSI ER1, App. B.3, line 91.\n\nSaltos WS1, Annex A, Table of Spills Reported in Blocks 7 and 21, 2002-2009.\n\nAgreement between Jos\u00e9 Daniel Jungal, Nancy Cecilia C\u00e1rdenas Hern\u00e1ndez and the Consortium, 11 May 2010 (English translation), p. 14 (**Exh. CE-CC-235**).\n\n510.\n\nIn light of the high levels of TPH present and by reference to its approach explained above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal determines a total impacted area of 400 m2, a total volume of soil of 1,000 m3,1016 and a remediation cost of **USD 390,000**, including a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).\n\nExceedance point 07-PAY28-SDB3-Rm requires remediation up to 2 meters, for a total volume of 400 m3 and exceedance point 07-PAY28-SDB4-R requires remediation up to 3 meters, for a total volume of 600 m3. See: GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, p. 43.\n\n511.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal determines that Burlington must bear the remediation cost for Areas 2MT and 3MT and half of the cost for the TPH exceedance at Payamino CPF, for a total amount of **USD 590,400** for Payamino 1/CPF.\n\n**n. Payamino 2/8**\n-------------------\n\n512.\n\nEcuador claims USD 31,899,459 for the remediation of 36,643 m3 of soil from an impacted area of 21,600 m2.1017 Burlington includes Payamino 2/8 as one of its principal sites for potential soil remediation, accepting that an area of 15,850 m2 and a volume of 18,345 m3 of soil are affected in an area of the Jungal swamp located to the north and east of the Payamino 2/8 platform and the Payamino 8 mud pit.1018 However, Burlington denies that the Consortium caused the harm, which it attributes to drilling mud discharges and oil spills from the Payamino 2 test pit prior to 1992.1019\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 52 (**Exh.

The Walsh samples are marked as red boxes.\n\n515.\n\nPayamino 2/8 is one of the most contentious sites and the Parties have extensively debated the potential causes for the environmental condition encountered in the swampy area known as the Jungal swamp. The Tribunal will address Ecuador's submissions on the pits in its analysis of mud pits below. Here it will only deal with the off platform sampling locations to the west, north and east of the Payamino 2/8 platform and adjoining pits.1023 In its review, the Tribunal also considers the samples collected for the Walsh report as GSI relies on these samples (shown as red boxes in the preceding figure).1024\n\nNo samples were taken from the platform. See: GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3.\n\nInforme T\u00e9cnico: Caracterizaci\u00f3n del Pasivo Ambiental Adyacente a la Plataforma Payamino 2-8 \u2013 Campo Unificado Coca-Payamino, Walsh N\u00famero de Proyecto: EC103-29 (\"Walsh Report\"), October 2010, Section 4.1.1 (**Exh.

See also: GSI ER2, App. L, Figures L.15.4 and L.15.8.\n\n516.\n\nIt is undisputed that the land to the east of the Payamino 2/8 platform is located in a designated protected area under the SNAP system that qualifies as sensitive ecosystem.1025 Burlington disputes, however, that the area to the west of the designated area falls within that same category and calls for the application of agricultural land use criteria. In accordance with its methodology (see section 4.3.2.c above), as the areas in question are immediately adjacent to a designated protected area, the Tribunal will apply the sensitive ecosystem criterion to all areas surrounding the platform (except for the access road, where no samples were in any event taken).\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 284; Map of Sites in Blocks 7 and 21 that Intersect Protected Areas, 2012 (**Exh.

It can be left open for present purposes whether it was caused by the discharge of test crude into the Jungal swamp or by the rupture of the Payamino 2 pit.1029 In any event, it occurred prior to the Consortium's operatorship. While it is true that successive operators did not indicate the presence of contamination at that site,1030 thus suggesting that the area was remediated when Oryx so requested in 1994, the Tribunal notes that Ecuador has provided no evidence of any remediation.1031 Therefore, the Tribunal cannot rule out that the environmental harm identified above was caused by prior operators and continues to be present in the swamp until today.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 93-116; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 248-264.\n\nSee, for instance: Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 101-105. Ecuador points to various environmental audits conducted by prior operators that do not mention the existence of an environmental liability in the Jungal swamp.

Claimant has not even entertained the possibility that Petroproducci\u00f3n took such actions\". Reply, \u00b6 99; R-PHB, \u00b6 781.\n\n519.\n\nNonetheless, there are several reasons for the Tribunal to hold the Consortium partially liable to remediate the exceedances in the Jungal swamp. First, there is contradictory expert evidence generated on the Consortium's behalf regarding the age of the crude found in the swamp. On the one hand, a report by Gr\u00fcntech dated 2 June 2010 estimated that age to be 4 to 7 years, which suggests that the contamination occurred during the Consortium's time, although the report specified that exact dating was impossible without a patron sample and that other factors influenced the dating procedure.1032 On the other hand, a report by Mr. Douglas from NewFields assessed Gr\u00fcntech's conclusion and opined that the rate of degradation of petroleum is \"highly variable\" depending on numerous factors not considered by Gr\u00fcntech, and finally concluded that any attempt to date the crude oil would be a guess and that it was \"equally as possible that the crude oil was released more than 20 years ago\".1033\n\nThe report stated the following: \"This affects the estimate of the age of the hydrocarbon, and a pattern sample is necessary to compare it, since, in absence thereof, its characteristics may suggest that its age would range between 4 and 7 years\" (Translation by the Tribunal). Gr\u00fcntech Analysis Report, 2 June 2010 (**Exh. E-270**). See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 783.\n\nNewFields Evaluation of Gruentec Cia. Ltda.

That council ordered an inspection which took place on 4 April 2007 and discovered \"[o]n the #02-08 platform (point 4) and to the side of it, a large area of approximately 20,000 m2 [\u2026] containing crude oil residues in large quantities\".1035 Burlington's silence about that inspection in these proceedings and its conclusion that crude oil was found *on the platform* and to its eastern side are disturbing.1036 The same is true of the fact that the Consortium apparently took no immediate action and that no samples were taken for the 2008 audit.1037\n\nEcuador also pointed to a complaint by Mr. Jungal in 2005, which was discussed before an Ombudsman with a Consortium lawyer in attendance. Mr. Saltos' attempts to justify that the Consortium took no action, on the grounds that Mr. Jungal always was a rather difficult person, does not appear convincing. See: Tr.

(Day 4) (ENG), 1289:21-1290:3 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that there is no verification list for that site in the 2008 Audit. See: Block 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008, p. 41, Table 3-3 and pp. 212-279 (with verification lists for Payamino 3 up to Payamino 23) (**Exh. E-252**).

It continues saying that Petroamazonas' health, safety and environment department knows the existence, but not the location and extent of the contamination, and that the local ombudsman knows the location but not the extent. The memorandum then goes on setting out three \"possible solutions\", namely (i) to remedy the site, (ii) to confine the problem by buying the land, or (iii) to dismiss any liability.1039 About this last option, the memorandum is quite explicit:\n\n\"- very probably, Mr. Jungal would sue us before the [criminal] courts for pollution (this crime has already been defined) and will seek multimillion dollar compensation\n\n- the State (Ministry of the Environment and/or Petroamazonas (sic)) will force us to remedy the site under their conditions\n\n- the cost will reach amounts very difficult to estimate now\n\n- the reputational cost to Perenco is also going to be very high\n\n- probably the State will assume that we are hiding many more damages and will scrutinize the operations area in search of more damages *and it* *will probably find them*.1040\n\nLetter of 23 February 2010 from Mr. Jungal to Perenco (**Exh.

E-269**) (Translation by Ecuador; emphasis added by Tribunal). See also: 2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 99-101.\n\n522.\n\nThis memorandum shows that the Consortium was aware of and concerned about the existing liabilities in the Jungal swamp.1041 In 2010, it eventually reached a settlement agreement with Mr. Jungal for an amount of USD 110,000, which agreement contained a confidentiality clause.1042 It is only thereafter that, on 11 June 2010, the Consortium notified the Ecuadorian authorities of the existence of contamination in the Jungal swamp.1043\n\nMr. Saltos testified that he referred to historical liabilities and that he was not aware of any liabilities of the Consortium. However, Mr. Saltos immediately conceded that he was not present in Block 7 at the relevant time. See: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1303:13-1305:9 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nAgreement between Jos\u00e9 Daniel Jungal, Nancy Cecilia C\u00e1rdenas Hern\u00e1ndez and the Consortium, 11 May 2010 (English translation), clause 2(1.1) (**Exh. CE-CC-235**).\n\nLetter of 11 June 2010 from Perenco to the Minister of Environment (**Exh. E-261**).\n\n523.\n\nThese facts lead the Tribunal to conclude that the Consortium indeed played some role in causing the environmental condition, or at least in not mitigating the harm when it became aware of it in 2005 and 2007, a role which is much more important than what Burlington would have the Tribunal believe. As a result, on the basis of the record and in the exercise of its powers in the assessment of the evidence and in the quantification of the damage, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Burlington must bear 60% of the remediation cost for that site.\n\n524.\n\nAs mentioned above, IEMS estimates the impacted area at 21,600 m2, while GSI accepts 15,850 m2. More specifically, GSI resorted to linear interpolation to calculate the impacted area for barium in the layer 0-1 meter (7,460 m2),1044 the impacted area for TPH in the layer 0-1 meter (13,090 m2),1045 and the impacted area for TPH in the layer 1-1.5 meters (4,990 m2).1046 These areas partly overlap and yield a maximum impacted area of 15,850 m2.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Att.

L.15.E, Table L.15.E.1, Figures L.15.E.A.3 and L.15.E.B.3.\n\n525.\n\nConsidering that only one exceedance contains TPH to a depth of 1.5 meters, the Tribunal accepts GSI's calculation of the impacted area for TPH in the layer 1-1.5 meters, namely 4,990 m2,1047 amounting to a total volume of 4,990 m3 of soil to be remediated in the 1-2 meter layer. Considering the TPH and barium levels of clean samples, the Tribunal is also in agreement with GSI's delineation of the impacted area of the 0-1 meter layer, considering that GSI extended the potentially impacted areas by 20 meters further to the north of the Walsh samples, which in turn are further north of IEMS's samples (see figure in paragraph 514).1048 In accordance with its general approach set out earlier (section 4.4.3.c), the Tribunal nevertheless extends GSI's maximum impacted area of 15,850 m2 to 17,000 m2 to take into account the relatively high cadmium exceedance at sample point 07-PAY28-SDB8-R.\n\n*Id*., Figure L.15.E.B.3.\n\n*Id*., Figure L.15.8.\n\n526.\n\nIn light of the foregoing and of its methodology on assessing remediation costs (section 4.5.2), the total volume of contaminated soil is 21,990 m3 and the total cost of remediation, including a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), is USD 8,576,100, of which Burlington shall pay 60%, i.e. **USD 5,145,660** for Payamino 2/8.\n\n**o. Payamino 3**\n-----------------\n\n527.\n\nEcuador claims USD 2,207,021 to remediate 2,453.10 m3 of soil from an impacted area estimated at 1,258 m2.1049 Burlington disputes any liability, since the alleged barium exceedance is located in a pit and any other exceedances are related to preConsortium drilling discharges in 1987.1050\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 53 (**Exh.

E-252**).\n\n529.\n\nOn this basis and by reference to its methodology explained above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal accepts that Burlington is liable to remediate this area, which it sets at 80 m2 and 2 meters in depth for a total volume of soil of 160 m3. With a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost amounts to **USD 57,600** for Payamino 3.\n\n**p. Payamino 4**\n-----------------\n\n530.\n\nEcuador claims USD 20,502,145 for the remediation of 20,529.60 m3 of soil covering an impacted area of 10,807 m2.1056 Burlington accepts that 510 m2 are impacted corresponding to 730 m3 of soil requiring remediation for an estimated USD 261,000.1057 It argues, however, that Ecuador \"ignores the operational history of the site\" and points to the discharges of oil-based drilling muds by CEPE in the unlined pit to the west of the platform.1058 More specifically, Burlington submits that two areas make up the impacted 510 m2, namely 230 m2 in Area 1MT (PA04) corresponding to 230 m3 of soil and a cost of USD 82,000, and 280 m2 in Area 1MT (PA14) corresponding to 500 m3 and a cost of USD 179,000.1059 Area 1MT (PA14) is in fact closer to Payamino 14, since it is on the other side of a creek flowing along the Payamino 14 platform, but Burlington alleges that any exceedances in that area result from the leaking Payamino 4 pit.1060 Finally, GSI indicates that exceedances in Area 1MT (PA04) were caused by oil residue from a produced water spill dating back to 1997.1061\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 40 (**Exh.

Both areas fully overlap. In Area 1MT (PA14), GSI calculated for TPH an impacted area of 280 m2 in the layer 0-1 meter, 190 m2 in the layer 12 meters and 30 m2 in the layer 2-3 meters, totaling 500 m3.

There is one IEMS sample location in Area 1MT (PA04) with a high TPH level (12,839 mg/kg) as well as barium and cadmium levels exceeding regulatory criteria.1066 One GSI sample location also shows TPH exceedances.1067 There are various cadmium exceedances as well.1068\n\nGSI concedes that primary forest is immediatedly adjacent to the east of the platform. The Tribunal further notes that GSI also concedes that the area to the west was only \"recently cleared\", and that satellite imagery dated 2010 shows the area with dense forest.

The spill history compiled by GSI for Payamino 4 reveals a 12 barrel crude spill in 1994 at a frac tank and a 7 barrel crude spill in 1995 at the transfer pump.1073 GSI also mentioned without providing supporting evidence the presence of oil residue remaining from a produced water spill in 1997.1074 The record also shows that the Consortium conducted a workover in 2005 on the Payamino 4 well, which involved the use of chemicals.1075 In addition, GSI referred to an unreported spill of produced water at an unspecified date during the Consortium's operatorship, that occurred to the west of the northeast corner of the platform \"when a contractor was relocating a former produced water discharge line\".1076 According to GSI, Perenco only later learned of this spill and was told \"that the spill area was covered with clean dirt by the contractor\".1077\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.3 and App. L.17, p. 1.\n\nGSI ER2, Table 4.\n\nWell Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Payamino 4, Reacondicionamiento # 13, September 2005, p. 4 (**Exh.

Although GSI stated that the spill location is \"west of the northwest corner of the platform\", GSI thereafter referred to that same spill location in relation to a former produced water line \"located just east of the road\" and IEMS sample 7-PAY-04-114-MS-A-1.0, which clarifies that GSI was in fact referring to the northeast corner of the platform.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n536.\n\nRegarding the Payamino 14/20/24 platform, the record reveals a 4.8 barrel diesel spill in 2000 at Payamino 14. In addition, Mr. Saltos confirmed that Payamino 14 was a stand-by well drilled by prior operators which the Consortium put back into operation, notably by conducting a well workover.1078 There are also indications that diluted effluents were discharged by the prior operator Kerr McGee into the Payamino River during the Payamino 24 pit closure in 2002.1079\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1238:16-22 (Cross, Saltos). See also: Payamino-14 Well History, 1994-2002 (**Exh. C-391**).\n\nThe 2002 closure report states the following: \"Laboratory analyses indicated that water from Payamino River after the discharge site was within parameters similar to the site before the discharge site, which is why it was authorized to discharge water from the pit at a flow rate of up to 1 liter per second. This was done through a 1\" trap from the pit to the river as from October 8\" (Translation by the Tribunal). Informe final de los trabajos de taponamiento de las piscinas de lodos del pozo Payamino 24, performed by Cerecons for Kerr McGee, February 2002, p. 5 (**Exh. E-361**).\n\n537.\n\nWith respect to Area 1MT (PA04), the Tribunal notes that GSI provides no supporting evidence for its assertion that a produced water spill in 1997 caused the exceedances.1080 The fact that Perenco apparently learned of (another) undated produced water spill, which was simply covered with clean soil, and left the situation unremediated reinforces the presumption that the Consortium caused the exceedances in the northeastern corner of the platform. Finally, considering the distance between Area 1MT (PA04) and Payamino 24, there is nothing to indicate that the diluted effluent discharges by Kerr McGee in 2002 in relation with the Payamino 24 pit closure affected the northeastern corner of the Payamino 4 platform. Accordingly, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Burlington failed to rebut the presumption that it caused the harm.\n\nGSI ER2, Table 4.\n\n538.\n\nThe impacted area in Area 1MT (PA04) covers five sampling locations,1081 each amounting to 200 m2, for a total area of 1000 m2. Contamination reaches a depth of 2 meters for all locations, except for one where contamination has only been confirmed in the first 1 meter layer. Accordingly, the total volume of soil to be remediated is 1,800 m3 and, considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is **USD 702,000**.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that GSI's revision of IEMS coordinates of sample 7-PAY-04-114-MS-A does not change the extent of the impacted area. See GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 31.\n\n539.\n\nWith respect to Area 1MT (PA14), Burlington speculates that \"[g]iven the presence of these oily, diesel-based muds and the lack of a liner, drilling mud containing oil could easily have leaked out and contaminated the surrounding soil\".1082 However, the Tribunal notes that Burlington provides no evidence for its contention that the Payamino 4 pit had leaked. It conducted no tests and its expert GSI observes, quite to the contrary, that \"[b]ased on field observations, if this was a former pit, it was properly closed\".1083 Therefore, the Tribunal holds the condition of the pit to be neutral in respect to the presumption of causation.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 465.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L.17, Payamino 4, p. 3.\n\n540.\n\nOn the one hand, the evidence of diluted effluent discharges conducted by Kerr McGee during the Payamino 24 pit closure could serve to rebut the presumption of causation. On the other, the fact that the Consortium put the Payamino 14 stand-by well back into service and thus conducted well workovers suggests that the Consortium also caused the environmental condition to the north of the Payamino 14/20/24 platform, in the area corresponding to Area 1MT (PA14),1084 which reinforces the presumption. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that Burlinton partially rebutted the presumption. Since Burlington bears the burden to disprove causation, the Tribunal holds that the Consortium shall bear half of the cost of remediation for Area 1MT (PA14).\n\nWell Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Payamino 14, Reacondicionamiento # 9 Payamino 14, August 2008 (**Exh. E-573**).\n\n541.\n\nAs to the extent of contamination, in accordance with its general approach (section 4.4.3.c), the Tribunal increases GSI's delineation around IEMS samples 7-PAY-04-113-MS-A and 7-PAY-04-113-MS-B from 280 m2 to 300 m2 so as to remediate the other bank of the creek. In addition, because of the high level of the vanadium exceedance, the Tribunal adds an impacted area of 300 m2 around the vanadium exceedance, and 200 m2 around each of the three additional cadmium exceedances.1085 The total impacted area in Area 1MT (PA14) is thus 1,200 m2.\n\nSample locations 7-PAY-04-113-MS-N, 7-PAY-04-113-MS-P and 7-PAY-04-113-MS-Q.\n\n542.\n\nThe volume of soil for the area delineated by GSI as increased by the Tribunal is 900 m3. Around the vanadium exceedance it is 300 m3 and for the three additional cadmium exceedances 1,000 m3.1086 The total volume of soil is thus 2,200 m3. Accordingly, considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428 and section 4.5.2 more generally), the total cost for the remediation of exceedances in and around Area 1MT (PA14) amounts to USD 858,000, of which Burlington shall pay **USD 429,000**.\n\nSample 7-PAY-04-113-MS-P has cadmium levels exceeding regulatory criteria at a depth of 3 meters. The other sampling locations show cadmium exceedances in the first 1-meter layer. GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 27-28.\n\n543.\n\nIn sum, the total cost of remediation incurred by Burlington with respect to Payamino 4 is **USD 1,131,000**.\n\n**q. Payamino 5**\n-----------------\n\n544.\n\nUnder its regulatory case, Ecuador claims USD 4,908,735 to clean up an area of 1,600 m2 and a volume of soil of 5,375.50 m3.1087 Burlington responds that there are no exceedances at that site when applying correct regulatory criteria and, if there were, they would be related to pre-Consortium drilling activities.1088\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 41 (**Exh.

GSI indicated that a sample with a matching sample ID (i.e., SDD) is located in the northwest corner of the platform, which is correct, but there is another sample with a matching sample ID on the far south of the platform. In addition, the IEMS map in Annex C shows a sample taken in an off platform location to the north of the platform.

It noted that Payamino 14 was a stand-by well put into operation by the Consortium, which involved workovers.1104 It further noted that there had been a 4.8 barrel diesel spill in 2000 and diluted effluent discharges in 2002 during Kerr McGee operations.1105\n\nTr.

See: Well Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Payamino 14, Reacondicionamiento # 9, August 2008 (**Exh. E-573**).\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1238:16-22 (Cross, Saltos).\n\n555.\n\nConsidering the effluent discharges by Kerr McGee in 2002 and the workovers conducted by the Consortium on the Payamino 14 well, the Tribunal holds that Burlington partially rebutted the presumption in respect of the exceedances to the northeast of the platform along the creek flowing into the Payamino River, and that the Consortium shall bear half of the cost of remediation for these exceedances.\n\n556.\n\nTaking account of, on the one hand, the relatively low levels of exceedances of some samples and, on the other, the fact that other samples are close to a protected area or in the immediate proximity of a creek, the Tribunal determines the total impacted area to extend to 560 m21114 and the total volume of soil to be remediated to 1,000 m3.1115 Considering a 20% contingency for platform locations and 30% for off platform locations (see paragraph 428), the cost of remediation for the exceedances on the platform and beyond its southern edge amounts to **USD 304,800**.1116 The cost of remediation for the exceedances to the northeast of the platform, including a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), is USD 78,000, of which Burlington shall pay half, i.e. **USD 39,000**. In total, Burlington is liable to pay **USD 343,800** for Payamino 14/20/24.1117\n\nThe impacted area is composed of 80 m2 for the platform exceedance point 14-18-MS-D; 80 m2 for the off platform exceedance point 101-MS-A, due to its proximity to the platform and the relatively low exceedance levels; 200 m2 for off platform exceedance point 103-MS-E; and 200 m2 for off platform exceedance points 14-18-MSD-E and 14-18-MS-E. For the location of these sample points, see: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.23.3.\n\nThe total volume of soil comprises: 240 m3 for exceedance point 14-18-MS-D; 160 m3 for exceedance point 101-MS-A; 400 m3 for exceedance point 103-MS-E; and 200 m3 for exceedance points 14-18-MSD-E and 14-18-MS-E. For the depth of the samples, see: GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 34-36.\n\nThe cost to remediate the platform exceedance is USD 86,400 and the cost for the off platform exceedances to the south of the platform is USD 218,400.\n\nThe total cost incurred by Burlington comprises USD 86,400 for the platform exceedance point and USD 257,400 for the off platform exceedance points.\n\n**t.

See: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 15 and App. L, Figures L.24.3 to L.24.5.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 267.\n\n558.\n\nThe following figure depicts IEMS's sampling locations,1121 being specified that GSI did not collect samples at this site:1122\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.24.3.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L.24; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.4.\n\n559.\n\nApplying sensitive ecosystem criteria,1123 in reliance on its methodology on land use (section 4.3.2.c), the Tribunal identified several exceedance points to the south of the platform with barium, cadmium and nickel.1124 Further, on the basis of the pit dimensions, the Tribunal finds that sample 7-PAY-15-111-MS-K-1,5 is not located within a pit, as GSI assumed, and therefore constitutes an additional barium and cadmium exceedance to the west of the platform.1125\n\nGSI concedes that the platform is surrounded by secondary forest. GSI indicates that a marsh is \"immediately adjacent\" to the north of the site extending 25 meters, and that a stream some 20 meters to the south-southeast of the platform flows to the north-northeast. See: GSI ER1, App. L.24, p. 6.\n\nSamples 7-PAY-15-109-MS-A-1,5, 7-PAY-15-109-MS-C-0,5, 7-PAY-15-109-MS-D-0,5, 7-PAY-15-109-MS-D-1,5 and 7-PAY-15-109-MSD-B-0,5. The Tribunal also notes a relatively high level of vanadium (264.5 mg/kg) at one point on the platform (sample 7-PAY-15-110-MS-B-1,5), although it falls below the adjusted permissible limit. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.24.1; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 36-38.\n\nSamples 7-PAY-15-111-MS-K-0,5 and 7-PAY-15-111-MS-K-1,5. See: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 15. However, the Tribunal accepts the pit dimensions brought forward by GSI, thus putting a number of IEMS samples within the pit.

Indeed, the record shows that the Consortium used Payamino 16 to store muds from other platforms.1137 Mr. Saltos explained that \"[s]ince Payamino 16 had stopped operations, we made these pits in order to put in them the muds coming from other areas, and that we had like too much mud\".1138 He added that the Consortium operated five unreported off platform pits at Payamino 16.

Mr. Saltos explained as follows: \"Q.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Burlington failed to rebut the presumption of causation and holds it liable to pay for the remediation of that exceedance.\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.3; Saltos WS1, Annex A; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6 76.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that GSI mentioned \"[m]inor localized oil releases\" inside the power oil pumping facility, including outside the containment vault.

Since this exceeds the sum claimed by Ecuador, the Tribunal reduces the amount awarded to **USD 111,683** as claimed for Payamino 21.\n\nSample location 7-PAY-21-222-MS-B still has a TPH level of 6,533 mg/kg at 3 meters depth and a level of 2,930 mg/kg at 4.5 meters depth.

See, for instance: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.29.3.\n\nIEMS samples 7-PAY-23-229-MS-C-0,5, 7-PAY-23-229-MS-C-1,5, 7-PAY-23-229-MS-C-2,5, 7-PAY-23-229-MS-D-1,5, 7-PAY-23-229-MS-E-1,5 and 7-PAY-23-229-MS-E-2,5; and GSI samples PA23-1M-03-(0.0-0.3), PA23-1M-03-(1.0-2.0) and PA23-1M-04-(0.0-0.3). See: GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 41-43 and Tables D.8 to D.10, in particular Table D.10, pp. 3-4.\n\nSample 7-PAY-18-218-MSD-B-0,5. See: GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, p. 42.\n\n577.\n\nWith respect to the exceedances around the northeastern corner of the platform, the Tribunal notes the presence of a chemical storage area and an unused concrete pad that according to GSI was \"possibly [used] for a former power oil pumping system or electrical generator and diesel fuel storage tank\".1160 The 3-barrel crude spill in 2000 mentioned by Burlington weakens the presumption of causation. However, it is noteworthy that GSI refers to various allegedly reported and remediated spills \"due to failures in the power oil units\" at various times in the past, without providing further details.1161 Burlington did not allege that the power oil unit was removed by prior operators. The Tribunal therefore understands that the Consortium also used it. In the same vein, the Tribunal is also inclined to find that at least some of the failures of the power oil unit and ensuing spills alluded to by GSI occured during the Consortium's time. The Tribunal futher notes that the 2008 Environmental Audit indicated that the perimeter drains and grease traps were in poor condition and that not a single soil sample was taken at that location at that time.1162 These elements tend to confirm the presumption that the Consortium caused the exceedances. At the very least, they fail to rebut the presumption. In addition, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Sol\u00eds referred to ruptures on the Payamino 23 flowline \"on at least four occasions\", presumably during the Consortium's time.1163 However, he did not recall the exact dates of the ruptures nor did he specify the impact of the ruptures on the environment and the measures taken.1164 The evidence of Mr. Sol\u00eds is therefore too vague, although, if anything, it would rather confirm the presumption. As a result, the Tribunal concludes that Burlington did not rebut the presumption of causation and must pay the cost for remediating the area to the northeast of the platform.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L.29, p. 3.\n\n*Ibid*. See further: GSI ER1, App. B.3.\n\nBlock 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008, p. 40, Table 3-3, and p. 90, Table 5.1a (**Exh. E-252**). No soil sample was either taken for the 2002 and 2006 audits. See: Block 7 Environmental Audit, Perenco Ecuador Limited, December 2002, pp. 47-48 (Spanish version) (**Exh. E-331**) ; Block 7 Environmental Audit, November 2006, p. 34 (Spanish version) (**Exh. E-334**).\n\nSol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6 25; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6 74.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n578.\n\nWith respect to the area to the southwest, Burlington provided no specific explanation. As a consequence, the Tribunal considers that it failed to discharge its burden to rebut the presumption of causation and shall pay the full costs of remediation. The impacted area to the southwest of the platform around sample 7-PAY-18-218-MSD-B extends to 200 m2. The total volume of soil amounts to 200 m3 and the total cost is thus **USD 78,000**, which includes a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).\n\n579.\n\nIn respect of the impacted area to the northeast of the platform. GSI divided this location in two, namely Area 1M surrounding the heavy metals exceedances and Area 2T around the TPH exceedance.1165 During its second field trip, GSI put a dirty boring back into the ground without taking any sample in the 2-3 meter layer southwards of sample location PA23-1M-02, just east of the oil/water separator.1166 Considering the topography, in particular the ridge to the east of Area 2T, the Tribunal generally accepts GSI's delineation in Area 1M.1167 Considering that GSI put a dirty boring back into the ground instead of testing it, the Tribunal will, however, collapse the three 1-meter layers taking the largest surface, namely 350 m2 and increase that area by 50 m2 to include the piece of land between the oil/water separator and the area designated above, which in total yields 400 m2.\n\nGSI ER2, App. D, Figures D.3.3, D.4.3, D.6.3, D.7.3.4.a, D.7.3.4.b and D.7.3.4.c.\n\nGSI's Field Forms indicate the following for sample location PA23-1M-02: \"2.10-2.4m: Dark grey silty clay (CL). Soft consistency. Homogeneous texture. High plasticity. Hidrocarbon odor. *Sampling spot was moved a couple meters to the north (N) of the initial borehole*. 2.4-3.0m: Soil conditions persist. Material is dark grey clay (CL) of soft texture. Homogeneous consistency. Low moist. Very plastic and with hydrocarbon odor\" (emphasis by the Tribunal).

Indeed, GSI collected a confirmation sample between 2.2 to 2.5 meters with a TPH level of 28.37 mg/kg to discard the two IEMS samples with TPH exceedances taken at 1.5 meters and 2.5 meters.1168 Because the expanded Area 1M partly overlaps with Area 2T,1169 the Tribunal adds 100 m2 to the 400 m2 above, for a total area of 500 m2. The volume of soil requiring remediation is 1,500 m3, and adding a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is **USD 585,000**.\n\nGSI ER2, p. 27, App. D, Tables D.9 and D.11 and Annex D.7.3.\n\nSee, for instance: GSI ER2, App. D, Figure D.7.3.4.a.\n\n581.\n\nIn sum, the total impacted area at Payamino 23 is 700 m2. The total volume of soil to be remediated amounts to 1,700 m3 for a cost of **USD 663,000** for Payamino 23.\n\n**x. Payamino Sanitary Landfill**\n---------------------------------\n\n582.\n\nEcuador claims USD 26,488,219 to remediate 30,517.50 m3 of soil to be taken from an area of 4,634 m2.1170 Burlington opposes that claim and contends that various samples located on the platform were in fact misplaced and were actually taken from the mud pits further south on the platform.1171\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 56 (**Exh.

See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.30.3.\n\n584.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will address these samples in its analysis on mud pits further below (paragraphs 797 and 801). On that basis, the Tribunal finds no non-pit soil exceedances at the Payamino Sanitary Landfill under any regulatory criteria.1173 Therefore, no remediation for non-pit soil is warranted at that site.\n\nIEMS ER3, Annex C, Payamino Waste Transfer Station, pp. 7-18; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L. 30.1; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 46-47.\n\n**y.

Accordingly, Burlington failed to rebut the presumption that it caused the exceedance in question. For these reasons, the Tribunal holds Burlington liable to remediate the TPH exceedance.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Slide 80; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009 (**Exh.

The Tribunal will further address the pit collapse (paragraphs 809-810) and Burlington's duty to properly abandon the platform below (paragraphs 883-888).\n\n2nd CMCC, \u00b6 268; Rejoinder, \u00b6 288; GSI ER1, App. L.32, p. 2; GSI ER2, App. B.5; IEMS ER4, Att. 38, C\u00f3ndor Norte, p. 1; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 36 (**Exh.

It is a marshy, low-lying area to the southwest with a creek flowing in a plain to the west of Gacela CPF. GSI identified this area as 2M. The following compounds are found there in excess of permissible limits: barium, cadmium and vanadium.1197 The vanadium exceedance reaches a level of 460 mg/kg.1198 Above Area 2M is another designated by GSI as 3M, which hosts various barium exceedances.1199\n\nSamples 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-A-1,5, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-B-0,5, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-B-1,1, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-C-0,5, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-D-0,5, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-D-1,5, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-D13, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-D-2,2, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-E-0,5, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-E-1,2, 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-F-0,5 and 7-GAC-1Y8-195-MS-H-0,5.

For GSI sampling locations, see also: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.3.4.\n\n599.\n\nThe second area is linked to Gacela CPF and designated by the Tribunal as Area 1TR. It is located in the plain mentioned above along a small creek below the westernmost oil/water separator at Gacela CPF.

By contrast, the record also includes several major unreported spills under the Consortium's operatorship, which Mr. Saltos sought to justify by explaining that the crude was contained within the retention walls of the CPF.1208 However, there are indications in the record that the unreported 100 barrel spill of formation water and crude on 20 January 2007 partly reached the API separator on the west of the CPF and was thus in close proximity to Area 1TR.1209 GSI also mentioned an allegedly remediated spill west of the API separator in 2007 of 3 barrels of produced water and 26 liters of oil.1210 In addition, there was another unreported crude spill of 17 barrels on 12 June 2008 at an unspecified location, of which 15 barrels were apparently recovered.1211 Finally, the Tribunal notes that not a single sample was collected for the 2008 Environmental Audit, notwithstanding these numerous and occasionally large spills.1212 These elements reinforce the presumption of causation in respect to Gacela CPF, and in particular as regards Area 1TR.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, lines 37-38 (**Exh.

Yet, various other events during the Consortium's operatorship do reinforce the presumption. A 3-barrel spill of produced water on 2 October 2004 was reported to DINAPA on 5 October 20041213 and a spill of 2-3 gallons of crude occurred on 2 October 2005 due to a technician incorrectly opening a valve.1214 The record reveals further that the Consortium conducted three workovers on the Gacela 1 well between 2002 and 2007 involving the use of chemicals during the repair or replacement of pumps.1215 The Consortium also drilled in the Gacela 8 well in 2004 when converting it into an injection well.1216 Finally, the Tribunal notes that not a single sample was collected for the 2008 audit.1217\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.3, line 73.\n\nSaltos WS1, Annex A.\n\nWell Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Gacela 1, Reacondicionamiento # 8, August 2002, Reacondicionamiento # 9, May 2005, and Reacondicionamiento # 10, June 2007 (**Exh.

E-252**).\n\n603.\n\nIn light of this record, the Tribunal assesses the rebuttal of the presumption of causation and the ensuing apportionment of liability as follows:\n\ni. Burlington is fully liable for the environmental condition in Area 1TR, mainly because of the unreported spills in 2007 and 2008.\n\nii. Burlington is partly liable for the environmental condition in Areas 2M and 3M in a proportion of 50%. This proportion is chosen because Burlington is deemed to have partially overcome the presumption. Indeed, pre-Consortium drilling is likely to be an important cause of the contamination, but spills occurred at Gacela 1/8 under the Consortium's watch in addition to various workovers, and no samples were taken on the occasion of the 2008 audit.\n\niii. Burlington is fully liable for the environmental condition in Area 1T. It is true that Petroamazonas built a pipeline and maintains a right of way at that location,1218 but there is no proof of its exact location or that it is located in such a way that it impacted Area 1T.1219 In any event, the Site Visit confirmed that the alleged right of way is not as large as the one seen at Mono CPF.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 80; Saltos WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\nMr. Saltos provided a photograph of the right of way under construction, which does not appear to depict Area 1M, but an area slightly further to the southwest. See: Saltos WS1, \u00b6 311.\n\n604.\n\nFinally, Burlington is liable to remediate all other exceedance points to the northwest of Area 1T, because it failed to rebut the presumption that it caused the observed harm.\n\n605.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's general methodology (sections 4.4.3.c ad 4.5.2), the remediation costs for these areas are as follows:\n\ni. The impacted area in Area 1TR is 600 m2 and the total volume of soil to be remediated is 1,000 m3.1220 Considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost payable by Burlington is **USD 390,000**.\n\nii. Although the Tribunal principally agrees with the interpolation undertaken by GSI in Area 2M,1221 it increases the impacted area from 570 m2 to 700 m2 to include the remediation of both banks of the creek and the piece of land where the creek reaches the culvert. Since the impacted area at 2 meters of depth is larger than in the layer above, but does not totally overlap,1222 the Tribunal decided to collapse both layers for a total volume of soil to be remediated of 1,400 m3. The cost of remediation is thus USD 546,000, which includes a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428). Out of this amount, Burlington shall pay 50%, i.e. **USD 273,000**.\n\niii. In principle, the Tribunal also accepts GSI's delineation of Area 3M.1223 However, it extends the impacted area around sample GACPF-3M-3-(1.0-2.0) by 110 m2 to include an area on the downward slope, for a total impacted area of 500 m2. Since barium contamination reaches 4 meters in depth and the lowest layer is the largest in terms of impacted area,1224 the Tribunal collapsed all four layers for a total volume of soil of 2,000 m3. With a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the cost of remediation totals USD 720,000, of which Burlington shall pay 50%, i.e. **USD 360,000**.\n\niv. The impacted area in Area 1T is 200 m2 and the volume of soil is 200 m3. Considering a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the remediation cost at that location amounts to **USD 72,000**.\n\nv. The impacted area around the discrete exceedance points to the northwest of Area 1T totals 280 m2, comprising 200 m2 around the lead exceedance to a depth of 2 meters1225 and 80 m2 around the slight cadmium exceedance to a depth of 1 meter.1226 The total volume of soil is 480 m3 and the total cost, including a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), is **USD 187,200**.\n\nThe impacted area around samples 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MS-I-0,5 and 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MS-I-1,5 is 200 m2. With a depth of 2 meters, the volume of soil is 400 m3. The impacted area around sample 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MS-H-1,5 is 200 m2 and, with a depth of 2 meters, the volume of soil is 400 m3. Finally, the impacted area around sample 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MSD-G-0,7 is 200 m2 and, with a depth of 1 meter, the volume of soil is 200 m3.

Gacela 2**\n----------------\n\n607.\n\nEcuador claims USD 17,434,730 to remediate 19,962.80 m3 of soil covering an area of 14,785 m2.1227 Although Burlington recognizes that an area of 340 m2 is impacted outside the southwestern corner of the platform, amounting to 340 m3 of soil to be remediated for a cost of USD 158,000, it disputes that it caused the exceedances observed. It argues that \"Perenco and Burlington never operated this platform \u2013 didn't drill, did not put a mud pit in, and so any contamination that we're speaking of was not from the Burlington/Perenco Consortium\".1228\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 16 (**Exh.

See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.34.3.\n\n611.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal identified one exceedance point on the platform to the east of the pit designated by GSI as Area 2P with TPH, barium and vanadium levels in excess of the industrial limit.1234 The vanadium level reaches 769.56 mg/kg and the TPH level is just under 20,000 mg/kg.1235 It further identified four barium exceedances in the area designated by GSI as Area 1M.1236 Finally, there are five exceedance points to the north of the platform showing that the soil is contaminated with cadmium, the highest level reaching 4.62 mg/kg.1237\n\nSample 07-GAC02-SDA2-R. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.34.1; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 51-53. The Tribunal accepts GSI's explanation that sample MS-GAC-C1-2.1-1 is located in the pit in Area 2P. See: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 11. The Tribunal further notes Burlington's explanation at the Site Visit that GSI revised the dimensions of the pit in Area 2P after reviewing the pit closure report of 1998, where it is stated that the pit is in fact 40 meters long. Having reviewed the closure report, the Tribunal accepts this position, although it observes that sample 07-GAC02-SDA-2 still appears to be located outside the pit area, based on the scale in GSI's maps. Accordingly, sample 07-GAC02-SDA3-R is deemed to be within the pit. See, for instance: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.34.3. See further: Tr.

In 1994, Gacela 2A underwent directional drilling and Gacela 2B underwent horizontal drilling in 1997.1238 The walls of the pit containing oil-based mud on the southwestern corner of the platform were remediated, the pit's contents were cemented, and it was eventually closed in 1998.1239 One well was shut in 19991240 and, although Burlington argued that the Consortium never produced oil at that site,1241 it appears that the latter conducted a workover on the Gacela 2B well by perforating into the Basal Tena and Napo \"T\" reservoirs,1242 which well operated for a short time in 2004.1243\n\nGSI ER2, App. B.5; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, lines 39-40 (**Exh.

It is also noteworthy that not a single soil sample was collected for the 2008 Environmental Audit of Block 7.1251 The 2008 audit actually mentions that the perimeter drains and grease traps are not held in good condition. Finally, the Consortium adopted an abandonment plan that was never carried out.1252\n\nGSI ER1, App. L.34, pp. 7-10.\n\nBlock 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008, p. 40, Table 3-3 (**Exh.

See further the verification list for Gacela 2: *Id*., pp. 289-292.\n\n615.\n\nTaking all these elements into account, in particular the fact that the pit located in the southwestern corner was remediated and compacted with cement prior to the Consortium's time, and that the Consortium conducted a workover at that site, the Tribunal considers that Burlington did not rebut the presumption of causation and holds Burlington liable for the environmental condition in Area 1M and on the platform. Burlington is also liable to remediate the exceedances to the north and northwest of the platform, since it provided no explanation on these exceedances and, therefore, left the presumption intact.\n\n616.\n\nFor these different areas, in accordance with its general approach (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal establishes the extent of contamination and the remediation costs as follows:\n\ni. GSI proposed an impacted area in Area 1M of 340 m2.1253 The Tribunal increases the surface to 400 m2 to include all soil between that area and the platform, and in particular the oil/water separator.1254 Hence, the total volume of soil amounts to 400 m3 and, considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is **USD 156,000**.\n\nii. The area impacted by the exceedance on the platform is 80 m2, the volume of soil 160 m3, and, with a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is **USD 57,600**.\n\niii. Finally, the impacted area for the five discrete cadmium exceedances to the northwest of the platform is 1,000 m2, with a total volume of soil amounting to 1,400 m3,1255 and a remediation cost of **USD 546,000**, which includes a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Table L.34.E.1 and Figures L.34.E.A.1 and L.34.E.B.1.\n\nSee, for instance: *Id*., Figures L.34.8 and L.34.E.B.1.\n\nThe impacted area is 200 m2 around each exceedance point. The depth of contamination is 1 meter at four exceedance points and 3 meters at sample location 07-GAC02-SDF3-R. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.34.1.\n\n617.\n\nIn total, the remediation cost payable by Burlington for Gacela 2 amounts to **USD 759,600**.\n\n**cc. Gacela 4**\n----------------\n\n618.\n\nEcuador claims USD 13,092,445 to remediate 13,458.90 m3 of soil covering an area of 11,139 m2.1256 Burlington rejects that claim and argues that no remediation is warranted at that site.1257 Burlington also pointed to the construction of the Oso-Gacela pipeline by Petroamazonas along the Gacela 4 platform.1258\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 18 (**Exh.

This applies to the TPH exceedance on the platform and the off platform exceedance, in an area that does not appear affected by Petroamazonas' expansion activities.1268\n\nCompare the sampling location with the tract of the right of way for the Oso-Gacela pipeline. See: GSI ER1, App. L.36, p. 1 and Figure L.36.3.\n\n623.\n\nThe impacted area on the platform extends over 80 m2; the volume of soil amounts to 160 m3; and applying a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the remediation cost totals **USD 57,600**. The impacted off platform area extends to 200 m2; the volume of soil to be remediated amounts to 400 m3; and, with a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the remediation cost totals **USD 144,000**. In conclusion, the total remediation cost at Gacela 4 payable by Burlington amounts to **USD 201,600**.\n\n**dd.

As to the five off platform exceedances, the impacted area is 1,000 m2. Considering a depth of two meters at two of theses exceedance points and one at the others, the total volume of soil to be remediated is 1,400 m3, for a total cost of **USD 546,000**, which includes a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).\n\n634.\n\nIn conclusion, the total remediation cost at Gacela 6/9 for which Burlington is liable amounts to **USD 574,800**.\n\n**ff.

To the extent that the amount awarded for this site does not exceed the amount claimed, the Tribunal accepts to grant the amount conceded by Burlington, in particular because the latter admitted a spill in 2005.\n\n642.\n\nIn connection with the impacted areas and remediation costs of the other contaminated locations, the Tribunal makes the following findings:\n\ni. For Area 1M, the impacted area is 200 m2 and the volume of soil 600 m3. The same measurements apply to the sample point between Areas 1M and 2M, i.e. sample 7-JAG-1-N1-MSD-A. Thus, the total for these two exceedance points is 400 m2 and 1,200 m3.\n\nii. Area 2M is in close proximity to human dwellings and located in the neck of a stream that flows away from the residential area. GSI estimated an impacted area of 370 m2 and a total volume of soil of 1,110 m3.1306 Considering in particular that GSI put dirty borings back into the soil1307 and that it did not account for sample JA01-2M-10, which exceeds the limit for residential land use for barium, the Tribunal sets the impacted area at 500 m2 and the soil volume for remediation at 1,500 m3.\n\niii. In respect of the seven exceedance points on or close to the platform, the Tribunal admits an impacted area of 560 m2. Considering a depth of two meters, this brings the volume of soil to be remediated to 1,120 m3.\n\niv. With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost incurred to remediate Area 1M and 2M, as well as the barium exceedance between these two areas, is **USD 1,053,000**. With a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the cost incurred to remediate the exceedances on or around the platform is **USD 403,200**. To this, the Tribunal adds the amount conceded by Burlington for Area 3T, i.e. USD 213,000, for a total amount to remediate this site of **USD 1,669,200**.\n\nGSI ER2, Table 4 and App. D, Tables D.7.2.4.a, D.7.2.4.c and D.7.2.4.d. The Tribunal notes that this soil volume exceeds the one claimed by Ecuador. Yet, again to the extent that the total amount that should be awarded according to the Tribunal's determinations for this site does not exceed the amount claimed, the Tribunal does take it into consideration.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 294, 365. See: GSI ER2, Annex D.7.1.1, Field Forms, p. 16, GSI Log Book for sample CO08-4M-05B, 3 March 2013.\n\n643.\n\nAs the total remediation cost claimed by Ecuador for Jaguar 1 is lower than the aggregate of the sums just established, the Tribunal awards the full amount claimed by Ecuador, i.e. **USD 995,206**.\n\n**gg. Jaguar 2**\n----------------\n\n644.\n\nEcuador claims USD 14,201,806 to remediate 15,403.70 m3 covering an area of 5,328 m2.1308 Burlington disputes that it bears any liability, although it recognizes that 100 m3 of soil have been impacted by pre-Consortium drilling activities and 30 m3 by an undated oil spill, for a total cost of USD 128,000.1309 Furthermore, Burlington accepts to bear USD 100,000 for costs needed to properly abandon the well.1310 Otherwise, Burlington discards the heavy metals exceedances as unrelated to oilfield operations.\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 24 (**Exh. E-500**).

On that basis, it identified one nickel exceedance just west of the wellhead,1316 and three cadmium and nickel exceedances on the eastern side of the platform close to the former crude oil storage tank vault.1317\n\nPlan de Abandono Definitivo y Entrega de \u00c1reas Utilizadas para la Perforaci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n de Petr\u00f3leo del Bloque 7: Gacela 2, Gacela 3, Lobo 4, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 8 (subsuelo \u00fanicamente), Jaguar 9, C\u00f3ndor Norte, 2 November 2008 (**Exh.

See: *Ibid*.\n\n648.\n\nApplying sensitive ecosystem criteria to sampling locations to the west, northwest and north of the platform1318 (leaving aside pit soil in Area 3P at this stage),1319 the Tribunal identified numerous cadmium and nickel exceedances, as well as four separate TPH, barium, chromium and lead exceedances, to the northwest of the platform in and around two areas identified by GSI as Areas 4T1320 and 1M.1321 GSI observed that Area 4T is a hillside which drops down toward the northwest into a steep ravine, lying above Area 1M which borders a creek.1322 Finally, there are a number of barium, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel exceedances in and around an area designated as Area 2M.1323\n\nIEMS indicates that jungle is located to the north of the platform and that agriculture is approximately 250 meters to the west. For its part, GSI accepts that secondary forest is located to the north of the platform, with some agriculture immediately adjacent to it, and that agriculture is located to the west. Based on a review of aerial photographs and satellite imagery, the Tribunal deems that subsequent land use at the sampling locations in Areas 1M, 2M and 4T is properly classified as sensitive ecosystem. See: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Jaguar 2, p. 1; GSI ER1, App. L.40.1, p. 6, Figure L.40.6 and Att. L.40.A-L.40.B.\n\nIn light of the very high barium, cadmium, lead, nickel and vanadium values, the Tribunal accepts that Area 3P is a mud pit. This does not appear to be disputed by Ecuador, since IEMS identified an area \"to the southwest of the platform [\u2026] presumed to be a potential mud pit due to the resistivity contrast seen in the area\" (REC No. 7-JAG-2-301).

E-256**).\n\n650.\n\nThere is no record of historical spills other than a 10 barrel crude oil spill on 6 April 2005 because the Jaguar 2 flow line was sabotaged.1326 Jaguar 2 is one of the few sites where Burlington acknowledged that there were \"limited areas of weathered crude oil\".1327 Mr. Saltos, Burlington's witness, testified that the affected area was cleaned and remediated,1328 but GSI noted that not a single barrel of crude oil was recovered, without further specifying what remediation technology was used, if any.1329\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.3, line 79; Saltos WS1, Annex A.\n\nGSI found visual evidence of a crude oil spill at Jaguar 2, specifying that \"[w]eathered crude oil is present in the ground surface within an approximate 30-square meter area located approximately 55 meters west of the northwest corner of the well platform\". See: GSI ER1, pp. 74, 81.\n\nSaltos WS1, Annex A.\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.3, line 79.\n\n651.\n\nThe record does not show the exact location of that spill. From GSI's general description, the Tribunal infers that it affected Area 4T and therefore most likely also Area 1M which lays further downhill.1330 This understanding is reinforced by the fact that IEMS heard from local residents of a crude oil spill to the northwest of the platform, which was apparently only superficially cleaned.1331 The Tribunal further notes that no samples were taken at Jaguar 2 for the preparation of the Abandonment Plan,1332 and only one soil sample for the 2008 Environmental Audit.1333 Finally, GSI's explanation that the weathered crude found in Area 4T may have been caused by \"natural oil seeps, which are known to occur in this area\" appears speculative and is not supported by other evidence. As a consequence, the Tribunal considers that Burlington has not rebutted causation and is liable to remediate the exceedances in Areas 4T and 1M.\n\nGSI provided the following observations: \"GSI investigated an area about 120 m northwest of the platform, where a hillside dropped down toward the northwest into a steep ravine. In this location, the GSI team found a recently cleared area with crude oil on the ground surface and buried at shallow depths at the southeast edge. The crude oil was localized and distributed over an approximately 7 m by 7m area. Available information suggested that these spots may be from a natural oil seep, which are known to occur in this area\". GSI ER1, App. L.40, p. 3.\n\nREC No. 7-JAG-2-298. See: IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Jaguar 2, p. 6.\n\nThe reason provided in the Abandonment Plan was that there was no evidence of areas contaminated by TPH. See: Plan de Abandono Definitivo y Entrega de \u00c1reas Utilizadas para la Perforaci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n de Petr\u00f3leo del Bloque 7: Gacela 2, Gacela 3, Lobo 4, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 8 (subsuelo \u00fanicamente), Jaguar 9, C\u00f3ndor Norte, 2 November 2008, p. 3-21 (**Exh. E-256**).\n\nBlock 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008, p. 40, Table 3-3 (**Exh. E-252**). Similarly, only one sample was collected for the 2006 audit. Block 7 Environmental Audit, November 2006, Table 33 (**Exh. E-334**).\n\n652.\n\nAs for the exceedances in and around Area 2M, they appear related to prior discharges into the pit located in Area 3P, since they have similarly high \u2013 sometimes even higher values \u2013 than the ones in Area 3P.1334 These exceedances therefore appear connected to pre-Consortium drilling operations and Burlington must be regarded as having rebutted the causation presumption in this respect.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Tables L.40.1, pp. 2-4, L.40.4 and L.40.5; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 6162 and Figure D.5.9.\n\n653.\n\nFinally, with respect to the discrete heavy metal exceedances located on the platform, the record shows that the Consortium did operate Jaguar 2 from 2002 through 2005. As a result, the Tribunal holds that Burlington failed to rebut the presumption of causation in this regard and, hence, must bear the costs of remediation.\n\n654.\n\nProceeding now to measure the impact and remediation costs for these three locations, the Tribunal makes the following findings:\n\ni. in respect of Area 4T, GSI delineated 30 m2 around the TPH exceedance (see figure in paragraph 646 above), although it is surrounded by heavy metals exceedances. This delineation appears clearly insufficient.1335 In reliance on its methodology set out above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal considers that the impacted area in and around Area 4T is 2,400 m2 and the total volume of soil 4,800 m3. Considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total remediation cost amounts to **USD 1,872,000**.\n\nii. In Area 1M, GSI delineated an area of 100 m2. Doing so, it incorrectly drew the outer edge of that area at the sample locations with chromium and nickel exceedances.1336 Seeking to better align the delineation with the contamination, the Tribunal determines an impacted area of 300 m2 surrounding these additional exceedance points, which also lies further upwards the hill, from where the contamination would appear to have flown down. Consequently, the total volume of soil is 600 m3. With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total remediation cost is thus **USD 234,000**.\n\niii. For the four platform exceedance points, the Tribunal determines the impacted area to be 800 m2. Considering a depth of two meters at three exceedance points and of one meter at the fourth point, the volume of soil is 1,400 m3. With a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the costs amount in consequence to **USD 504,000**.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Figures L.40.8 and L.40.E.B.2.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Figures L.40.8 and L.40.E.B.1.\n\n655.\n\nIn sum, Burlington is liable to compensate Ecuador for Jaguar 2 in an amount of **USD 2,610,000**.\n\n**hh. Jaguar 3**\n----------------\n\n656.\n\nEcuador claims USD 15,933,119 to remediate 15,960.10 m3 of soil to be taken from an area of 5,051 m2.1337 Burlington rejects this claim and refers in support to preConsortium drilling activities. It also discarded the vanadium exceedance outside the southeastern corner of the platform as a \"background metals issue\".1338\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 25 (**Exh. E-500**).

Including a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is **USD 129,600** for Jaguar 3.\n\n**ii. Jaguar 5/CPF**\n--------------------\n\n662.\n\nEcuador claims USD 307,302 to remediate 230.10 m3 covering an area of 177 m2.1351 Burlington disputes this claim on the ground that there are no TPH or barium exceedances at that site.1352\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 22 (**Exh. E-500**). Compare with: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Jaguar CPF Corrected, pp. 19-20; IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Jaguar CPF, p. 26; 2nd SMCC, \u00b6 261; Reply, \u00b6 195(iv).\n\nGSI ER2, Tables 1 and 3.

On that basis, it found no exceedances to the west of the CPF, but identified a series of cadmium, lead and nickel exceedances in three pockets to the east and southeast of Jaguar 5/CPF. The first pocket is located to the east of the CPF and shows cadmium and nickel exceedances.1357 The second is adjacent to the southeast corner of Jaguar 5 with a lead and a cadmium exceedance.1358 The third pocket is yet further southeast with six sampling points showing cadmium exceedances.1359\n\nSample 7-JAG-5-225-MS-H-0,5.

GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, p. 68.\n\n665.\n\nThe historical record of spills evidences four relatively minor crude oil spills in 1996, two at an API separator, one at the sump, and a fourth one at an unspecified location.1360 In this context, the Tribunal is struck by an e-mail written by Mr. Saltos to his supervisor in 2008. That communication relates to water releases and requests \"immediate corrective actions\" before an inspection to avoid having \"to regret unfavorable reports\". It further recommends not to create \"too much attention around these works (military?), so that there is no resistance, *and so that it cannot be documented*\".1361 The e-mail continues referring to the need to clean the banks of the creek for about 100 meters in the following terms:\n\n\"Discharge of served waters from a plant (grey water????)\u2026 We have to clean the banks of the canal, about 100 meters below the discharge, clean the grease trap, confirm parameters; we have to take into account that we already have NC+ included in the 2008 audit, precisely due to this finding, and that Dinapah has sentenced us with an ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD and FINE which we have yet to know who will pay (?) or who we will impose it on (?)\".1362\n\nAll events had 5 or less barrels spilled. See: GSI ER1, App. B.3, lines 22, 26, 28 and 30.\n\nE-mail of 19 December 2008 from Mr. Saltos to B7 HES Supervisor (emphasis added by Tribunal). This e-mail was attached to the second witness statement of Mr. Sol\u00eds. See: Sol\u00eds, WS2, Annex 61.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n666.\n\nIn his e-mail, Mr. Saltos also mentioned the need to review the \"site destined to treatment of contaminated soil\" so as to ensure that \"the containment ditches and grease traps are operating well\", or else \u2013 so he suggested \u2013 \"we have to construct them immediately\".1363\n\n*Ibid*. See also: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1261:22-1272:11 (Cross, Saltos).\n\n667.\n\nIn light of this evidence, the Tribunal finds Burlington fully liable for the exceedances identified at this site, i.e. the vanadium exceedance and the off platform exceedances to the east and southeast of Jaguar 5/CPF.\n\n668.\n\nSince the volumes of soil to be remediated and the remediation costs as calculated by the Tribunal exceed the amount claimed by Ecuador,1364 the Tribunal grants the full amount claimed for Jaguar 5/CPF, namely **USD 307,302**.\n\nAs seen in paragraph 662 above, Ecuador only claims the remediation of 230.10 m3 of soil covering an area of 177 m2. The Tribunal identified one vanadium exceedance on the platform and a series of nickel and cadmium exceedances in three pockets to the southeast and east of the platform. The remediation of the exceedance, for instance, at sample point 7-JAG-5-229-MS-B-1,5 would already have warranted recovering 400 m3 of soil, exceeding the volume claimed by Ecuador.\n\n**jj. Jaguar 7/8**\n------------------\n\n669.\n\nEcuador claims USD 1,101,436 to remediate 1,017 m3 covering an area of 790 m2.1365 Although Burlington recognizes that 110 m3 of soil may require remediation for a cost of USD 108,000, it denies liability invoking pre-Consortium activities that took place in 1996.1366 This said, Burlington accepts to pay USD 100,000 for well site abandonment works.1367\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 26 (**Exh.

On that basis and accepting that the area designated by GSI as Area 2P is a mud pit,1371 the Tribunal identified three barium exceedances along a creek to the east of the platform in the area designated as Area 1M.1372\n\nThe pit closure report of 1996 mentions that the pit is located outside the platform. At the Site Visit, IEMS confirmed that Area 2P is indeed a pit. See: Pasos y procedimientos ejecutados para el taponamiento de piscinas en las plataformas Mono y Jaguar, performed by Llori Hnos Cia.

The volume of soil is 200 m3. Adding a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the remediation cost thus amounts to **USD 78,000** for Jaguar 7/8.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Att.

Indeed, GSI initially explained that these muds and cuttings \"were possibly discharged to the land surface east of the facility\", corresponding to Area 2M.1410 During the Site Visit, Mr. Chaves from IEMS suggested that Area 2M is a pit, and that it is leaking its contents into Area 3MT, which lays further southwards and downhill.1411 In view of the statement of Mr. Chaves on the existence of a pit, the high levels of metal concentrations (the barium level exceeds 10,000 mg/kg, the cadmium level is above 11 mg/kg and the lead level exceeds 938 mg/kg), and the depth of the contamination (down to the lowest samples at 2.6 meters),1412 the Tribunal accepts IEMS's statement that Area 2M is a pit. It will thus address this area in its analysis of mud pits (see paragraph 811 below).\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.5 and App. L.50, p. 2; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 57 (**Exh.

Ltda. for Oryx Ecuador, September 1996 (**Exh. E-350**). In its first report, GSI mentioned that there were no closed pits at this facility, and indicated that the cuttings and drilling mud from Mono 2 to 5 \"were reportedly disposed into the on-site mud disposal well by injection\". GSI ER1, App. L.50, p. 3.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L.50, p. 3. GSI further suggested that, in addition to the exceedances in Area 2M allegedly caused by drilling mud discharges in 1989, that exceedances in Area 3MT were caused by drilling mud discharges and an oil spill in 1996.

The Tribunal further notes that the Consortium conducted seven workovers at the Mono 1 well between 2003 and 2008, mostly to repair the electrosubmersible pumps, but also involving the use of chemicals, such as workovers ## 10-12. See, for instance: Well Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Mono 1, Reacondicionamiento #12, February 2008, p. 3 (**Exh. E-573**).\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1193:3-1196:6 (Cross, Saltos).

It in particular noted as follows:\n\n\"Historical spills prior to and in 2007 occurred at the oil trap in the southeast corner of the facility and were reported and remediated appropriately. At the time of GSI inspection, this area (located approximately 50 m to the east of the CPF fence line) was covered by dense grass, low brush, and trees. GSI found no evidence of oil staining or sheen on the water or sediments, even when sediments were disturbed\".1423\n\nGSI ER1, App. L.50, p. 5.\n\n692.\n\nGSI further added:\n\n\"Further downstream, in an area near the southeast corner of the CPF, natural/organic iron bacteria was present and visible in the base of the stream. No evidence of impact was observed and the area appeared to be properly remediated\".1424\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n693.\n\nThe cross-examination of Mr. Saltos, however, brought to light a number of relevant facts. First, Mr. Saltos stated that the Consortium conducted workovers at the Mono 1 well.1425 Second, he testified that there \"is a certain tendency to problems\" with power oil pumps, which are \"problem-prone\".1426 Third, Mr. Saltos confirmed that the power oil unit is close to the grease trap on the southeastern corner of the platform.1427 Fourth, he agreed that, if a spill occurred due to problems with the power oil unit, then the production water mixed with crude oil flows towards that grease trap.1428 This is in particular so because the grease trap on the southeastern corner of the platform is at the \"lowest end of the platform\".1429 Fifth, Mr. Saltos stated that five barrels of oil migrated outside the platform on 5 July 2008.1430 Sixth, he explained that Annex A of his witness statement does not list \"all of the spills that were not to be reported\", meaning spills which discharge less than 5 barrels or which remain within the confines of the platform were not listed.1431 When asked whether there were other incidents at Mono CPF during the Consortium's operations, Mr. Saltos responded \u2013 in an open manner that the Tribunal appreciated \u2013 \"Yes, unfortunately\".1432 Finally, Mr. Saltos did not dispute Mr. Sol\u00eds' characterization of the situation at Mono CPF as \"critical\" and acknowledged that Mr. Sol\u00eds had requested \"urgent repairs\" at that site in 2008.1433\n\nTr.

Even if the drainage and creek were remediated by the Consortium, as Burlington alleges, this remediation obviously was insufficient. Burlington's liability also covers the pockets of exceedances in Area 3MT on the other side uphill of the creek. Indeed, since these exceedances are uphill, they cannot be linked to the exceedances in the creek and the only explanation seems to be that they are the product of willful discharges in the environment, rather than the product of accidental spills.1434\n\nAlthough GSI suggested during the Site Visit that the samples may be mislocated, GSI accepted these exceedance points and delineated around them. Tr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG), 100:20101:2 (Tribunal, Bianchi at Mono CPF). See also: C-PSVB, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 43 and note 108. The Tribunal agrees with IEMS that these exceedances most likely occurred during a separate incident, unrelated to the other exceedances in the creek in Area 3MT. See: Tr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG), 81:21-82:17 (Tribunal, Chaves at Mono CPF). In any event, GSI's theory that IEMS's samples may be mislocated is proven wrong by GSI's own delineation sample which revealed a chromium exceedance (sample MOCPF-3MT-11-(1.0-2.0)). See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.50.5 and Figure L.50.5.\n\n695.\n\nFinally, Burlington has not sought to dispute causation in respect of Area 1M. As a result, it must be deemed liable for the environmental condition of that location and bear the remediation cost.\n\n696.\n\nGoing over to the assessment on impacted soil and remediation costs, the Tribunal makes the following findings always in accordance with its general approach explained above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2):\n\ni. GSI estimated that Area 3MT comprises two impacted pockets of 700 m2 in total (see picture in paragraph 685 above).1435 In light of the elevated exceedance levels and considering that GSI put dirty borings back into the ground instead of testing them,1436 the Tribunal extended the impacted area of 3MT to 1,000 m2 to cover both sides of the creek. Moreover, considering that GSI discarded its own delineation sample with a chromium exceedance when delineating the impacted area uphill on the other side of the creek, the Tribunal added an impacted area of 300 m2 at that location. The total volume of soil in the creek area is thus 1,000 m3 and in the area uphill 600 mX3. With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total remediation cost for Area 3MT thus amounts to **USD 624,000**.\n\nii. The impacted area around the two exceedance points in Area 1M is 400 m2; the total volume of soil 400 m3; and, with a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is **USD 156,000**.\n\nMore specifically, GSI calculated for Area 3MT an impacted area of 700 m2 for barium in the 0-1 meter layer, and of 630 m2 in the 1-2 meter layer. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.50.8 and Att. L.50.E, Table L.50.E.1 and Figures L.50.E.A.1, L.50.E.B.1; GSI ER2, Table 4.\n\nGSI noted the following in its field forms: \"Had to move up the bank and upstream (about 1 meter each). First location had a moderate to strong chem odor (Mono CPF)\". See: R-PHB, \u00b6 365; GSI Log Book for sample MOCPF-3MT-04, 8 March 2012, p. 1 (**Exh. E-475**).\n\n697.\n\nIn sum, the total cost payable by Burlington for Mono 1-5/CPF is **USD 780,000**.\n\n**oo. Mono Centro/10-12**\n-------------------------\n\n698.\n\nEcuador claims USD 9,406,337 to remediate 9,763 m3 over an area of 3,769 m2.1437 Burlington opposes this claim on the ground that there are no exceedances when applying correct regulatory criteria and that most samples are located in a pit.1438\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 33 (**Exh.

See also: Remodeled site for Mono 10/12, August 2013, Figure 09-B (**Exh. E-499**).\n\nGSI ER2, Tables 1 and 3. GSI explains that because the barium level of 756.59 mg/kg in sample 07-MON01-SEB1-R(0,0-0,3)m falls \"within the range of background barium concentrations reported by IEMS and GSI\", it did not consider this sample to show an exceedance.

Indeed, barium could well have spilled over during the closure process.1444\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.5; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, lines 55-56 (**Exh.

On that basis, the Tribunal holds that Burlington bears no liability for this site as regards non-pit soil.\n\n**pp. Mono Sur/6-9, 11**\n------------------------\n\n703.\n\nEcuador claims USD 11,458,398 to remediate 13,088.40 m3 over an area of 9,787 m2.1445 Burlington recognizes that 610 m3 of soil may require remediation for a total cost of USD 175,000,1446 but denies that it bears any liability for this environmental condition and points to drilling activities in 1996.1447\n\nRevised Attachment 35 to IEMS ER4 (Excel), line 34 (**Exh.

IEMS notes that the platform is \"mainly surrounded by jungle and estuary\". The satellite imagery does not confirm the presence of agriculture to the north of the platform, in particular in Area 1MT. Accordingly, the Tribunal applied sensitive ecosystem criteria to Area 1MT and to sampling locations to the west and southwest of the platform.

GSI relies on aerial photographs and does not state that the pit was constructed by the Consortium.\n\nA 20bl crude oil spill on 1 December 1996 at the Mono 6 power oil unit, of which all crude was recovered; a 1bl crude oil spill on 15 December 1996 at the Mono 8 injection line, of which no crude was recovered; a 5-6bl crude oil spill in 1997/1998 beyond the oil trap to the southwest; and a 1.5bl crude oil spill on 1 October 1999 at the Mono 7 manifold, all of which was recovered. See: GSI ER1, App. B.3, lines 34, 35 and 47.\n\n*Id*., lines 84 and 90.\n\nSol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6 25.\n\n708.\n\nIn light of the high barium levels at the IEMS sample location, the exceedances identified above appear unrelated to these crude oil spills. Considering further that the Consortium conducted well workovers at this site1459 and that the heavy metals exceedance levels are highest in the upper soil layer implying that contamination is relatively recent, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the presumption of causation is not rebutted and Burlington's liability is established.\n\nThe record confirms that the Consortium conducted two workovers at the Mono 9 well, the first involving drilling activities. In 2003, workover # 5 was unsuccessful in its attempt to change the zone from the Upper Hollin to the Napo \"U\" reservoir; and in 2007, workover # 6 involved another evaluation of the Napo \"U\" reservoir. See: Well Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 to 2012, Mono 9, Reacondicionamiento # 6, November 2007, pp. 2, 4.\n\n709.\n\nApplying linear interpolation, GSI calculated a depth-integrated impacted area of 250 m2 and a volume of soil of 610 m3 (see picture in paragraph 705 above).1460 More specifically, GSI calculated for barium an area of 220 m2 in the 0-1 meter layer, 240 m2 in the 1-2 meter layer, and 130 m2 in the 2-3 meter layer.1461 In addition, GSI calculated for TPH an area of 10 m2 in the 0-1 and 1-2 meter layers within the area of the barium exceedance.1462\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.51.8 and Att.

This said, it collapses all three layers to calculate the volume of soil, since there is not much difference between the respective areas of the three layers.\n\n711.\n\nAs a consequence, the total impacted area is 250 m2 and the total volume of soil is 750 m3. Considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost payable by Burlington is **USD 292,500** for Mono Sur/6-9, 11.\n\n**qq.

Further, referring to sensitive ecosystem criteria to off platform areas to the northwest, north, northeast and east of the CPF,1467 the Tribunal identified several cadmium exceedances in two discrete sampling locations to the northwest1468 and in two locations to the east.1469 Finally, applying agricultural land use criteria around the flare, the Tribunal identified two locations with cadmium exceedances.1470\n\nGSI states that secondary forest surrounds the platform.

GSI indicated that it was drilled by BP in 1970, but it appears more probable that BP drilled it in 1988 as stated by IEMS.1471 Be this as it may, it is largely irrelevant for present purposes, since Mr. Saltos testified at the Hearing that this was a standby well which the Consortium put back into operation, notably by conducting workovers.1472 In addition, there is evidence of a 14 barrel crude oil spill on 24 April 2003 at the Oso 1 storage tank, a 7 barrel crude oil spill on 25 January 2004 at the Oso CPF tank pit, and a 4 barrel crude oil spill on 22 July 2004 at the Oso CPF tank.1473 The record also shows that equipment failure caused a 35 barrel spill on 6 August 2004 at the transfer pipeline in the Oso field, although the exact location is not clear.1474 Finally, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Sol\u00eds mentioned a post-Consortium diesel spill on 1 September 2009 \"apparently caused by an improperly closed valve on the tanker truck\" along the road some 300 meters away from the CPF.1475\n\nGSI ER1, App. L.56, p. 2; IEMS ER3, Annex C, Oso CPF, p. 5.

Ecuador rebuts these assumptions, submitting as follows:1545 (i) GSI adduced no evidence of the proper construction, maintenance and verification of the mud pits; (ii) the Consortium had no written policy of mud pit treatment, as admitted by Perenco and evidenced by the fact that Burlington does not even know the correct number of mud pits located in the Blocks; (iii) Consortium employees confirmed that pits had not been properly constructed, which is well illustrated by the mud pit in Coca 8; (iv) the record shows that only 34 out of the 226 mud pits are lined (but not necessarily adequately maintained), Oso 9 providing a good example of unlined pits;1546 (v) the pits were not properly maintained; (vi) some pits were not reported or properly closed, as confirmed by Mr. Saltos in relation to Payamino 16;1547 and (vii) the mud pits were not properly monitored, as evidenced by Mr. Saltos's statement that the Consortium did not test the mud pits six months after closure as required by Table 7 of RAOHE.1548\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 460-480.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 466. Ecuador states that evidence shows that 33 pits are not lined, and that there is no evidence that the remaining 159 pits are lined.\n\nAnd as further demonstrated with the examples of Gacela 3, Mono 1-5, Jaguar 7-8, Coca 4, Payamino 5, Chonta 1, Nemoca 1, Coca 15, Payamino 23, Payamino 24, Jaguar 9, Coca 18, Coca 19 and Coca CPF, where contaminated soils were not remediated during pit closure. *Id*., \u00b6 474.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 479-480; Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1348:19-1349:12 (Cross, Saltos).\n\n752.\n\nIt is further undisputed, according to Ecuador, that there were incidents at a number of pits and that some are leaking:1549\n\n\u2022 Individuals have been affected by leaks from pits at Coca 4, Payamino 1, Oso A, and Gacela 2;\n\n\u2022 The Waiponi Ocatoe pit collapsed in 2002/2003 and the C\u00f3ndor Norte pit partially collapsed in 2006, as acknowledged by Mr. Saltos;\n\n\u2022 The eastern part of the Mono CPF platform contains discharges of drilling mud and cuttings, as admitted by GSI;\n\n\u2022 The southern part of the closed pit in Coca 8 contains drilling mud beyond the boundaries of the pit, as admitted by GSI;\n\n\u2022 The lining is perforated in the pit of the Payamino 8 well, as discovered by IEMS;\n\n\u2022 The pits in Coca 18/19 have released their contents; and\n\n\u2022 The pit in Mono 10/12 is leaking.1550\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 482.\n\nReply, \u00b6 195(ii).\n\n753.\n\nThese instances thus bely GSI's assumptions, argues Ecuador, as they show that mud pits are bound to collapse or leak and thus contaminate the environment for generations to come, unless tested and restored as regular soil.\n\n754.\n\nFinally, Ecuador submits that Burlington never considered the groundwater effects around mud pits, notwithstanding the fact that mud pits are usually 4.5 meters deep and that the water table is between 1 and 3 meters deep.1551 Accordingly, mud pits are in direct contact with groundwater. Even if the depth of some pits had been reduced, such as in Oso A, this did not prevent contact with groundwater due to the fluctuation of the water level and of the risk of leaking or leaching.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 501-506.\n\n**5.2 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n755.\n\nFor its part, Burlington argues that IEMS improperly passed off mud pit soil as regular soil. Specifically, IEMS collected samples from closed mud pits and subjected them to the testing methodology and regulatory criteria applicable to regular soils. As a result, Ecuador's counterclaims have yet again been grossly inflated.\n\n756.\n\nBurlington contends that one fifth of IEMS's soil samples were collected from mud pits, none of which should be used to ascertain purported contamination in the Blocks.1552 Thus, Burlington rejects Ecuador's claim to remove all mud pits, but accepts that four open and unused pits at three sites (Coca 8, Coca 4 and Payamino 5) must be closed for a total cost of USD 68,000, assuming that \"the pits will require placement and compaction of clean backfill soil to grade, followed by re-vegetation of the former pit area\".1553\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 313-316, 333.\n\nGSI ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 243, 248 and 255; GSI ER2, \u00b6 141 and Exhibit 28.\n\n757.\n\nMore specifically, Burlington argues that mud pits are not to be equated with regular soil and IEMS erroneously collected 624 samples from within pits.1554 Mud pits are approved containment areas designed precisely to contain the discharge of industrial substances \u2013 such as drilling muds, barium and cuttings. They of course contain higher levels of potential contaminants than does non-pit soil; that is their purpose. It thus makes sense to subject mud pits to regulatory criteria different from those for regular soils. Thus, permissible levels of contaminants for mud pits are provided in the less restrictive Table 7 of RAOHE, whereas the more restrictive limits for regular soils are found in Table 6.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 271, 327; GSI ER1, p. 91, \u00b6 225(3).\n\n758.\n\nIn this context, Burlington further argues that Ecuador itself has acknowledged in the past that Table 7 is the applicable regulatory standard for mud pits. Burlington points to the fact that IEMS also applied Table 7 to mud pits in its expert report for the *City Oriente* arbitration while IEMS incorrectly applied Table 6 to mud pits in the present arbitration.1555 In any event, Burlington argues that Ecuador's concerns regarding the hazards associated with pits are \"misplaced\" because \"[p]its are *not* inherently harmful to the environment\" since their contents are \"stable and non-toxic\".1556\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 318-321.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 134 (emphasis in the original).\n\n759.\n\nFor Burlington, IEMS has also applied the wrong methodology to test mud pit samples. The proper test consists in ascertaining whether the mud pit contents can \"leach\" impermissible amounts of substances into groundwater sources.1557 However, IEMS did not perform a single leachate test for any of its 624 mud pit samples.1558 Further evincing its biased approach, IEMS omitted testing mud pits built by Petroamazonas. GSI also indicates that, except for barium, the metal concentrations in the 624 pit samples collected by IEMS are below background levels in clean natural soils.1559 Therefore, says GSI, \"releases of pit materials to surrounding clean soils could not cause an increase in concentrations of cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and vanadium above levels already present in the soils\", and only elevated barium levels in soils surrounding pits may signal pit releases.1560\n\nAccordingly, says Burlington, the regulatory units are different for regular soils and for mud pits. For regular soils, Table 6 of RAOHE tests *solids* and hence measures permissible concentrations in mg/kg. For mud pits, on the other hand, Table 7 of RAOHE tests *liquids leached* and thus sets forth maximum limits in mg/l. See: CMCC, \u00b6 324.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 327. See also: GSI ER1, p. 91, \u00b6 225(3).\n\nGSI ER1, p. 91, \u00b6 252(3). In GSI ER1, App. D, Table D.3, GSI lists IEMS's sampling results and identifies samples taken from pit locations. See also GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2 for IEMS samples that were misplaced (for instance, Jaguar 7 (p. 7), Payamino 15 (p. 15), Payamino 10 (p. 16), Coca 13 (p. 17) and Payamino Sanitary Landfill (p. 32)). For a comparison of IEMS samples to the regulatory criteria applied by GSI, see: GSI ER1, App. F.4.\n\nGSI ER1, pp. 91-92, \u00b6 252(3) and Exhibit 39.\n\n760.\n\nBurlington further opposes Ecuador's argument that each mud pit constructed before July 2009 must be \"dug up, moved off site, and re-buried\" as wholly unsupported by regulations, local practice, and sound science.1561 The use of pits for permanent on site disposal is common practice in Ecuador and around the world. In fact, Table 7 was precisely crafted for this purpose; it conclusively shows that pit soil is subject to different limits than regular soil.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 137.\n\n761.\n\nIn Burlington's view, Ecuador is also mistaken in claiming that all dry pits must comply both with Tables 6 and 7. Indeed, the introductory paragraph of Article 59, a provision on pit remediation, clarifies that that provision \"applies only to a special category of pits\", namely those that contain weathered crude or that were poorly managed, which is not the case of the Consortium's pits.1562\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 96, 126-128.\n\n762.\n\nFor Burlington, properly closed pits, i.e., those that were dehydrated, compacted and covered with clean soil and new vegetation, \"do not fall within the ambit of Article 59 and need not be remediated\".1563 This is confirmed by practice, especially by the fact that the Ecuadorian authorities have never requested compliance with both Tables 6 and 7 on the ground of Article 59.1564 Ecuador's attempt to introduce a barium standard from TULAS so as to apply it to pits \"blatantly disregards RAOH's supremacy in regulating matters specific to hydrocarbons operations\", especially since TULAS contains no provisions on pits.1565\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 128; Bed\u00f3n ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 151-153; Saltos WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 13-18.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 131; Bed\u00f3n ER1, \u00b6 8; Bed\u00f3n ER2, \u00b6 30.\n\n763.\n\nFinally, in Burlington's submission, Ecuador is also wrong to claim that all pits should be subject to the more stringent Table 7a for unlined pits, since it was the Consortium's practice to build all pits with synthetic liners, as Mr. Saltos confirmed, and historical pits do not leak since they are lined with clay soils, as GSI indicated.1566 In sum, Ecuador is seeking to impose remediation costs on Burlington which have never been applied to date.1567 Accordingly, Burlington requests the Tribunal to dismiss Ecuador's claim to have all pits removed or remediated.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 137; Saltos WS1, \u00b6 185; GSI ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 143.\n\n**5.3 Discussion**\n------------------\n\n764.\n\nThe Parties essentially diverge on whether mud pits must be removed from the Blocks, whether Table 6 applies in addition to Table 7, and whether Consortium pits were always lined. The Tribunal will start by discussing the applicable regulatory framework (5.3.1). It then addresses the condition of the pits in the Blocks (5.3.2 to 5.3.6), before drawing conclusions with respect to potential remediation and the costs thereof (5.3.7 and 5.3.8).\n\n**5.3.1 Regulatory framework**\n------------------------------\n\n765.\n\nRAOHE expressly regulates the use of mud pits for hydrocarbons operations. Article 12 provides that oilfield operators must undertake internal monitoring, including by remediating contaminated mud pits. Article 16 further provides that mud pit remediation programs must be authorized by the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection at DINAPA. Article 28(c) prohibits the uncontrolled disposal of any types of wastes, specifying that pits used for final disposal must include an appropriate canalization system to control leachates.1568 Article 58(b) prohibits any disposal of production test fluids in pits.\n\nThe Glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines leachates (\"*lixiviado*\") as follows: \"Solution resulting from the transport of water through the pores or cracks in the soil or other solid and porous media and the physico-chemical interactions of this water with the mineral and organic components of the soil\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n766.\n\nArticle 52(d.2) is entitled \"[o]f the treatment and final disposal of drilling fluids and cuttings\". Article 52(d.2)(2.1) provides that any drill site must include a system for the treatment and disposal of fluids and solids generated during drilling operations. More specifically, Article 52(d.2)(2.3) states that, during and after the drilling, all solid wastes, including muds and cuttings \"can be disposed once they comply with the parameters and limits in Table 7\".1569\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal.\n\n767.\n\nArticle 59 specifically deals with the treatment and closure of pits. It specifies that, in case of pits containing weathered crude or badly maintained pits, the operator must proceed to cleaning and treating the pit content, recuperating the crude, and then sealing and revegetating the area with native species. For pits containing crude and/or water, Article 59 provides that the crude will be recuperated for subsequent use, that any crude that could not be recuperated would be treated either in the pit or *ex situ* preferably through bioremediation, that the floor and walls of the pit must be treated until they comply with Table 6 before rehabilitating the site. For dry pits containing crude but no water, Article 59 stipulates that they must be remediated until they comply with Tables 6 and 7.\n\n768.\n\nTable 7 is entitled \"[p]ermissible limits for leachates for the final disposition of drilling muds and cuttings on the surface\". In its opening paragraph, Table 7 states that drilling muds and cuttings destined for \"final disposal on the surface\" must comply with the parameters and permissible limits in the table \"depending on whether the site of final disposal contains an impermeable base or not\".1570 The second paragraph specifies that, in addition to initial testing, the mud pits must be periodically monitored by taking leachate samples seven days, three months, and six months after final disposal.\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal.\n\n769.\n\nTable 7 is divided into two parts. Part a) applies to pits without impermeable liner and Part b) applies to lined pits. Table 7 contains the following criteria:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| a) SIN \u00a1mpermeabilizaci\u00f3n de la base |  |\n| Par\u00e1metro | Expresado en | Unidad | Valor l\u00edmite permisible |\n| Potencial hidr\u00f3geno | pH | \u2014 | 6 |\n| Conductividad el\u00e9ctrica | CE | pS/cm | 4,000 |\n| Hidrocarburos totales | TPH | mg/l | <1 |\n| Hidrocarburos arom\u00e1ticos policfclicos (HAPs) | C | mg/l | <0,003 |\n| Cadmio | Cd | mg/l | <0.05 |\n| Cromo total | Cr | mg/l | <1.0 |\n| Vanadio | V | mg/l | <0.2 |\n| Bario | Ba | mg/l | <5 |\n| b) CON \u00a1mpermeabilizaci\u00f3n de la base |  |\n| Par\u00e1metro | Expresado en | Unidad | Valor l\u00edmite permisible |\n| Potencial hidr\u00f3geno | pH | \u2014 | 4 |\n| Conductividad el\u00e9ctrica | CE | pS/cm | 8,000 |\n| Hidrocarburos totales | TPI-I | mg/l | <50 |\n| Hidrocarburos arom\u00e1ticos policfclicos (HAPs) | C | mg/l | <0 005 |\n| Cadmio | Cd | mg/l | <0.5 |\n| Cromo total | Cr | mg/l | <10.0 |\n| Vanadio | V | mg/l | <2 |\n| Bario | Ba | mg/I | <10 |\n\n770.\n\nEcuador argues that all mud pits must comply with both Tables 6 and 7,1571 whereas Burlington contends that only Table 7 applies to properly managed mud pits.1572 The Tribunal has no difficulty finding that Table 7 applies to mud pits and not Table 6 (subject to the provisions in Article 59 to which the Tribunal will revert below). This follows not only from Article 52(d)(2)(3) which refers only to Table 7,1573 but also from the fact that Table 6 applies to soil remediation in general and Table 7 to drilling muds and cuttings destined for final disposal in pits specifically. This is further confirmed by the fact that Table 6 provides no criteria for barium, which is the compound most commonly used to drill wells and thus most commonly found in mud pits, whereas Table 7 specifically regulates barium, in addition to other parameters not contemplated in Table 6 that are also used in drilling operations, such as chromium and vanadium.\n\nThe Tribunal notes IEMS's different point of view when contemplating recourse to either Table 6 or 7 depending on the \"timing and purpose of the study\", although IEMS ultimately opined that all pits should be tested against Table 6 in the present case. \"The concentrations of contaminants in mud pits can be analyzed as per the Table 6 of RAOHE (total concentration) or Table 7 (concentration of contaminants on leachate) depending on the timing and purpose of the study\". IEMS ER4, p. 27.\n\nBed\u00f3n ER1, \u00b6 43; Bed\u00f3n ER2, \u00b6 147.\n\nBed\u00f3n ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 149-150.\n\n771.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal cannot follow Ecuador's interpretation of Article 59. It shares Professor Bed\u00f3n's opinion that this provision is not of \"general application\" to all mud pits.1574 The introductory paragraph shows that Article 59 applies to two discrete situations, namely to pits containing weathered crude and to poorly managed pits. In these two situations, Article 59 requires the complete remediation of such pits, including the cleaning of the floor and walls. In such instance, the floor and walls must comply with Table 6. Further, if a pit is totally removed and backfilled with clean soil, the new location must comply with Table 6 in addition to Table 7. Or, as Professor Bed\u00f3n put it, \"the area after the remediation must comply with Table 6 because it becomes regular soil; but it must also be in accordance with Table 7 to ensure that there are no remnants of drilling muds that might leach into the subsoil\".1575\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 152.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 153.\n\n772.\n\nFor all other situations, only Table 7 applies to mud pits.1576 Indeed, Table 7 contemplates a different method of analysis than Table 6, since it requires the testing of *leachates* \"to determine the extent to which barium and other metals in the muds could potentially be dissolved and carried outside the confines of the pit by water\".1577 And as GSI put it, RAOHE \"sets no limit on the total barium concentration in the solidified mud and soil cuttings enclosed within the pit and does not require the contents of a mud/cuttings pit be tested in the same manner as non-pit soils, as this would require these materials to be removed from the very pit in which they were disposed \u2013 an illogical requirement and contrary to accepted practice in the oil industry\".1578 The fact that Perenco's abandonment plan for Block 7 spoke of testing three pit samples from Gacela 2, Jaguar 9 and C\u00f3ndor Norte against Table 61579 does not change the Tribunal's conclusion that only Table 7 applies under applicable law, a conclusion which is reinforced by Ecuador's own approval of the Consortium's pit closure reports that tested mud pits only against Table 7.1580\n\nThe Tribunal notes IEMS's mention that, in addition to crude or heavy metals, mud pits might contain hazardous wastes such as \"potassium hydroxide, quicklime, iridium (190), uranium (191), thorium, strontium (90)\". However, as IEMS concedes, \"[t]he contamination of drilling mud with several of these substances in Blocks 7 and 21 has not been studied\". IEMS ER4, p. 27. Thus, there is no claim for contamination with hazardous substances other than those listed in RAOHE Table 7.\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal.

The Tribunal further notes that the pit remediation reports for Sacha referred to by Ecuador apply Table 6 precisely because the pits had to be remediated. They therefore do not support the contention that normal pit closure requires testing pits against Table 6. See: Letter of 31 August 2006 from Eng. Consuelo Hern\u00e1ndez (DINAPA) to Jaime Crow Montalvo (Petroproducci\u00f3n) (**Exh. CE-CC-415**) ; Letter of 10 January 2007 from Eng.

E-337**) ; Pit closure report for Oso 3, May 2003, pp. 4-5, 9-10 (**Exh. E-466**).\n\n**5.3.2 Removal of pits**\n-------------------------\n\n773.\n\nThis review of the applicable legal framework evinces that the use of mud pits is common practice in oilfield operations to permanently dispose of drilling muds or cuttings produced during the drilling of wells or subsequent well workovers. This follows, for instance, from the term \"final disposal\" (*disposici\u00f3n final*) in Table 7, making clear that mud pits serve as permanent disposal grounds.1581 Such practice is also confirmed by IEMS, according to which the use of mud pits is a common practice in the oil industry and is a method approved by the Government of Ecuador for the management and disposal of drilling mud associated with well development.1582 The lawfulness of the practice is also clear when one considers that Petroamazonas has continued to build mud pits and discharge drilling muds and cuttings into them, for instance, in Yuralpa Pad G or Oso A (it being noted, once more, that IEMS chose only to identify the Consortium pits at these locations as RECs).1583 These findings do away with Ecuador's claim that all mud pits in the Blocks need to be removed.1584\n\nSee also: Article 52(d)(2) which refers to the final disposal of drilling muds and cuttings. See further: Bed\u00f3n ER2, \u00b6 148.\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 23.\n\nSaltos WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 202-212.\n\nThe Glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines \"final disposal\" as follows: \"Final storage method and/or site, or waste destruction method\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n774.\n\nThe conclusion that pits need not be removed is further strengthened by the fact that Ecuador, although it calls mud pits \"ticking time bombs\",1585 has not adduced evidence of even a single instance where an oilfield operator has been required to remove all mud pits after the end of operations.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 449; Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 112:7-8 (Opening, Garc\u00eda Represa); Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 79. Ecuador's contention is partially contradicted moreover by IEMS's evidence that the \"use of synthetic liners is an appropriate engineering control for the protection of the environment, provided they are installed, inspected and maintained properly, as they are not leak-proof. Synthetic liners provide an impermeable barrier that avoids the direct contact of the contaminants with the underlying soil and the direct mobilization of these contaminants when conditions suitable for contaminant transport are present (as with earthen pits). The RAOHE recognizes that synthetic liners increase the level of protection of the environment [\u2026]\". IEMS ER4, p. 39.\n\n775.\n\nConsequently, there is no reason to remove properly constructed, managed and approved pits from their actual location. This applies also to approved mud pits located at the edges of platforms, which are at a higher risk of collapsing due to erosion, such as the mud pit at Yuralpa Pad A, which the Tribunal had a chance to see during the Site Visit. Absent proof to the contrary, it must be assumed that these pits are correctly managed and that any deterioration over the course of time will be adequately addressed by the current operator.\n\n776.\n\nThe situation is obviously different for pits that are demonstrated to have been badly built or managed, in particular pits that collapsed or were leaking their contents into the environment during the Consortium's operatorship. The situation is also different for the Consortium's unreported pits, such as the \"workover pit\" at Payamino CPF (which the Tribunal has addressed in its analysis on regular soil) or the \"auxiliary pits\" at Payamino 16, which must be removed since they have never been approved by Ecuadorian authorities.1586\n\nWith respect to Payamino 16, Mr. Saltos confirmed that five pits had never been reported: \"Q. [\u2026] they also say that there were more than five mud pits that were never reported to the authorities. Do you see that? A. Yes, that is correct. Q. So there are more than five pits in Payamino 16; right? A. Yes. Q. That were never reported to the authorities; yes? A. Yes, that is correct. [\u2026] The pits here, however, were very small pits that were three to 4 meters by 2 meters, and two or 3 meters deep. So, these were small auxiliary pits\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1333:19-1334:18 (Cross, Saltos).\n\n**5.3.3 Pit construction**\n--------------------------\n\n777.\n\nWith respect to the construction of pits, Burlington indicated that the Consortium had no written policy for the construction, cleanup, monitoring, testing and closing of pits. Mr. Saltos, however, explained that, while it had no \"specific little book\", the Consortium had procedures in place which were regularly followed.1587 He added that it was the Consortium's policy to place geomembranes in the pits (an issue to which the Tribunal will revert below).1588 In this context, IEMS points to the Municipal Ordinance over the Control and Monitoring of Waste Discharges of the Municipality of Francisco de Orellana. Ecuador, however, did not invoke this regulation in its submissions, which regulation does not in any case apply to mud pits for oilfield operations, but to pits in general, and includes requirements such as \"a) the distance from the edge of the pit to residential, agricultural and recreational areas and surface water bodies; b) the depth of the groundwater table; c) the geology and hydrogeology; d) the risk of flooding, subsidence and landslides at the site; and e) the protection of the natural and cultural heritage of the area\".1589 Although informative, the Tribunal deems that this ordinance is not sufficiently specific to be helpful in the present context when dealing with mud pits built during oilfield operations.\n\nMr. Saltos responded as follows during his cross-examination: \"Q. Perenco said that it does not have a written specific policy for the construction, cleanup, monitoring, testing and closing of pits. Did you know that? A. A specific policy, no, but for the construction of pits, we knew the dimensions they should have, the depth they should have, what kind of liner or geomembrane should be used in order to protect the pit, and then when the covering of the pits was contracted, we specified the kind of products to be used when there were exceedances, and how to cover these, how thick the layer should be, and how we should compact everything so that no failures arise out of that pit [\u2026] There wasn't a specific little book, but we had all the procedures that had to be applied in place\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1328:2-20 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1347:8-14 (Cross, Saltos). This is further corroborated by IEMS's interview of Mr. Cesar Andrade, a construction supervisor employed by Perenco, who indicated that the Consortium used liners \"in all the pits with which he was involved\". IEMS ER4, Att. 17, p. 27.\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 24. See also: Municipal Ordinance over the Control and Monitoring of Waste Discharges of the Municipality of Francisco de Orellana, 29 January 2001, Article 6(1)(1)(a)-(e). IEMS ER4, Att. 7. See also: IEMS ER4, p. 24.\n\n778.\n\nIEMS also pointed to eyewitness evidence suggesting that Consortium pits had not been appropriately constructed.1590 However, the evidence of Mr. Cesar Andrade to which IEMS refers does not support the contention of poorly constructed pits. In fact, he stated that he was not aware of leaks in pits, only adding that \"geological and hydrological studies were not performed\".1591\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 24 and Att. 17.\n\n*Id*., Att. 17, p. 27 (interview with Mr. Cesar Andrade). The Tribunal notes, however, that Mr. Andrade indicated that the Oso A pit was built close to the river and that the Gacela 2 pit was built in a \"very high area\", without providing any further information as to whether these pits were leaking. See also: *Id*., Att. 17, p. 34 (interview with Fernando Herrera), and p. 36 (interview with Jorge Lara). Only Mr. Ramirez stated that liners \"lacked maintenance\" and that crystallized liners leaked, pointing to Coca 4 and the concrete pits in \"Payaminos\". See: *Id*., Att. 17, p. 29 (interview with Marco Ramirez). And Mr. Coro stated that he did not know if any pit leaked. *Id*., Att. 17, p. 32 (interview with Marco Coro). See also: Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slides 148149.\n\n779.\n\nIn addition, while Ecuador complains that GSI provides no evidence of the proper construction of pits, for instance by opening pits, it is equally the case that IEMS did not open any of the pits either to ascertain how they were built (even though Ecuador bears the burden to prove harm originating from pits closed before the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution in October 2008).\n\n780.\n\nTherefore, Ecuador's contention that construction requirements \"may not have been met by the Consortium\" remains speculative and unpersuasive.1592 Specifically, in respect of the Nemoca and Payamino CPF pits, the pits were constructed by prior operators and were remediated in 2000 and 2001 respectively.1593 As a consequence, there can be no claim against the Consortium on the ground that these pits were poorly built. There could only be an allegation that they have been poorly managed by the Consortium, which Ecuador has, however, not specifically put forward.\n\nFor instance, IEMS indicated that \"[a]t this point, the construction methods and procedures used by Oryx, Kerr McGee and the Consortium remain unclear. There is no evidence on how these pits were built\". IEMS ER4, p. 38.\n\n*Id*., p. 24 and Att. 5 (Nemoca) and Att. 6 (Payamino CPF).\n\n**5.3.4 Pit management**\n------------------------\n\n781.\n\nUnder Article 12 of RAOHE, oilfield operators are bound to regularly monitor the environmental conditions around existing pits, including historical pits built by previous operators. Moreover, if the condition of the pits deteriorates and poses a threat to the environment or to human health, then pursuant to Articles 16 and 59 of RAOHE the current operator is under an obligation to remediate that situation, even if the defective pit was built by a prior operator. The Tribunal agrees with IEMS's position that \"[s]ound environmental management practice would have been to monitor the conditions of the mud pits installed by the previous operators in order to assure that there are no leaks or negative impacts to the environment\".1594 The Consortium appeared to understand being under such a duty as even Mr. Saltos acknowledges that it engaged in the remediation of contamination left behind by prior operators.1595\n\n*Id.,* p. 32.\n\nMr. Saltos stated that \"as a policy, Perenco had to remedy the soils, regardless of their origins\" and \"regardless of who caused the problem in the soil\", before carrying out \"an investigation to determine final liability\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1180:9-15 (Cross, Saltos). With respect to mud pits more specifically, Burlington did not challenge IEMS's statement that the Consortium remediated, for instance, oil outcroppings from the Coca 4 pit that was improperly built by a prior operator. See: IEMS ER4, p. 32.\n\n782.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal reads Article 59 as incentivizing oilfield operators to use water-based drilling muds, as opposed to oil-based drilling muds that are still permitted under RAOHE,1596 but which come with the duty to remediate pits containing weathered crude. The Tribunal has more difficulty in accepting Ecuador's contention that Article 59 further imposes on current operators the duty to remediate any historical pits containing weathered crude left behind by prior operators. This difficulty primarily derives from the text of Article 59 and from the fact that there is no evidence in the record showing that Ecuadorian authorities have ever requested any oilfield operator, and in particular the Consortium (or previous operators regulated under RAOHE since 2001), to remedy historical pits containing weathered crude built by prior operators.\n\nOil-based drilling muds must comply with Table 4 of Annex 2 and be disposed in the earth, while the other drilling fluids must comply with Table 7 of Annex 2. Article 52(d.2.5) reads as follows: \"Where mineral oil-based muds are used, their final disposal shall be onshore, complying with the permissible limits of Table No. 4 of Annex 2 to this Regulation; any decantation muds resulting from the treatment of fluids shall be treated and disposed of, complying with the permissible limits of Table No. 7 of Annex 2 to this Regulation\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. EL-174**). The Tribunal notes that the Parties' experts have not tested any samples against Table 4, and that there is no claim that any limit under that table has been breached.\n\n783.\n\nAs to Ecuador's argument that mud pits are indiscernible from the surrounding environment and thus can no longer be located with the passing of time, the Tribunal agrees that this is indeed a worrying situation,1597 but here again the Tribunal notes that RAOHE does not require operators to clearly demarcate existing pits, and on the contrary requires that they be revegetated with local flora. Ecuador has not pointed to any other potentially relevant provision stipulating such a requirement. What RAOHE requires is that all mud pits must be approved, properly constructed and sealed, monitored and finally revegetated. This leads the Tribunal to turn its attention to the methodology for testing mud pits.\n\nGSI also indicated that \"[f]ollowing closure, these pits are commonly indiscernible from the surrounding terrain and contain a solidified mixture of drilling mud and soil/rock cuttings (generally comparable to natural soils), overlain by a cover of clean soil and vegetation\". GSI ER1, p. 17.\n\n**5.3.5 Method for testing pits**\n---------------------------------\n\n784.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, IEMS's argument that the \"best approach\" is to evaluate mud pits \"per analytical methods for soil contamination\", since leachate testing is only limited to six months under Table 7, is unconvincing.1598 IEMS explains that \"if samples are collected several years after being buried and exposed to rainwater infiltration, the mobile fractions of contaminants have already leached\" and thus contaminated the surrounding soil.1599 Therefore, says IEMS, \"collecting samples for determining the residual mobile fractions of contaminants would not provide clear results on whether the drilling mud should have been disposed of into the pit or even remediated several years earlier\".1600 The Tribunal does not find this argument convincing, because operators wishing to make use of pits must submit to the Ecuadorian authorities the results of the three leachate tests under Table 7 during the pit closure process. They thus provide the data to determine whether the pits in question comply with applicable standards at and shortly after the time when the pits were actually closed.1601 Furthermore, Table 7 prescribes three leachate tests in the six months following closure and no recourse to other testing.\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 28.\n\n*Id*., p. 27.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Ecuador pointed to the closure report for the Jaguar 9 pit showing that leachate testing was only conducted three years after closure instead of following the timeline provided in Table 7. While this deficiency reflects on the Consortium's contention of being a model operator, it does not overcome the Consortium's evidence that the pits in question comply with regulatory criteria, which Ecuador could only have done by analyzing the relevant pits per Table 7. See: Reply, \u00b6 39(d); IEMS ER4, p. 33. IEMS further pointed to Oso 3, Oso 9 and Oso A as examples where leachate testing was not in accordance with Table 7. IEMS ER4, p. 33. With respect to Oso 3 and Oso A, mentioned by IEMS as other examples where the Consortium monitored the pits in 2007 and 2008, the Tribunal notes that the closure reports of these pits were not reviewed by IEMS and that it is therefore speculative whether the Consortium exceeded the timing requirements under Table 7 during the pit closure process or whether additional monitoring took place in 2007 and 2008. The Tribunal is further mindful that, when interrogated about the Oso 9 pits, Mr. Saltos conceded at the Hearing that in some cases the Consortium failed to comply with the monitoring procedure under Table 7, as the following excerpt show: \"Q. Now, you make a reference to the exhibit, Table 7b of RAOHE. But there is no six-month test. Do you know why? A. Well, in some cases there is no six-month test. These are some mistakes we made\". The Tribunal will deal with the Oso 9 pits further below. See: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1349:4-8 (Cross, Saltos); R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 479-480.\n\n785.\n\nAs to the actual methodology for leachate testing, Annex 5 of RAOHE states that the applicable analytical method is USEPA Method 1311 TCLP (toxicity characteristic leaching procedure), with a footnote allowing for equivalent procedures.1602 GSI undertook its leachate analysis through the TCLP method as well as the USEPA Method 1312 SPLP (synthetic precipitation leaching procedure), which RPS argues is not equivalent to TCLP, since TCLP estimates \"potential mobility of materials placed in landfills\", whereas SPLP is used to \"determine the potential for leaching of chemicals from contaminated soils\".1603 The Tribunal can dispense with entering into this discussion, since GSI provided analytic results under both methods,1604 i.e. TCLP and SPLP, and the Consortium itself previously conducted leachate tests applying the TCLP method.1605 As a result, the Tribunal will rely on the results obtained via the TCLP method.\n\nGSI ER1, p. 104. See also: RPS ER2, p. 81.\n\nRPS ER2, p. 81.\n\nGSI ER1, App. D, Table D.12A.\n\nSee, for instance, the closure report for Coca 19. Reporte de taponamiento de piscinas de Coca 19, October 2004, pp. 6-10 (**Exh. E-337**).\n\n**5.3.6 Lined v. unlined pits**\n-------------------------------\n\n786.\n\nThe opening paragraph of Table 7 provides that mud pits must comply with the permissible limits indicated in the table \"depending on whether the site of final disposal [i.e., the pit] has an impermeabilization at its base or not\".1606 Accordingly, Table 7 is divided in two parts with Table 7a applying to unlined and Table 7b to lined pits.\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 7 (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n787.\n\nGSI considers Table 7b applicable in all cases since in its view all pits in the Blocks have a clay base that effectively functions as a natural liner.1607 The Tribunal disagrees; it understands Table 7b to refer to impermeable synthetic liners (such as geomembranes) and not to natural soils with a high degree of impermeability such as clayey soils. This also appears to be the understanding of Burlington's witness Mr. Saltos, who worked in the Blocks since 1995 and was responsible for environmental and industrial safety.1608\n\nSee, for instance, GSI's testimony at Coca 8: \"Q. Does the pit have a liner? [\u2026] A. Yes. The pit was constructed in the time period of 1991. It has a clay liner beneath it. It's the soil we are standing on. You could see it's of low porosity because it's muddy. [\u2026] This is exactly the kind of soil that's used for lands [sic] fills and pits and ponds throughout the world, and that's the type of liner it has. The pit is not leaking\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 118:1- 1 0 (Tribunal, Connor at Coca 8). See, similarly: GSI ER1, p. 17, \u00b6 21; Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 19:17-20 (Tribunal, Connor at Gacela 2).\n\nReferring to Oso 9, Mr. Saltos testified that pits were tested against Table 7a in cases where the condition of the geomembrane had been altered: \"Q. But all of them have geomembranes? A. Yes, geomembranes were placed there. Now, during the operations, at some points, there may have been an alteration of the condition of the geomembrane. That could have happened. And in those specific cases there was a possibility of resorting to Table 7a. Why? Because it was not an obligation to actually put a geomembrane there. Table 7 says either with or without impermeabilization\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1346:4-13 (Cross, Saltos). See also: Saltos WS1, \u00b6 177.\n\n788.\n\nThe application of stricter standards for unlined pits under Table 7a as opposed to Table 7b makes sense, knowing that slope failures or underground roots may perforate the subsurface soils;1609 mud pits are typically 3 to 4 meters deep1610 and thus can potentially come into contact with the groundwater;1611 some pits are located in sandy not clayey soils (such as Payamino 14/20/24 and Coca CPF/Coca 2).1612 Finally, there is evidence in the record that the Consortium also tested several of its pits against Table 7a, as the pit closure reports for Coca 19 and Jaguar 9 demonstrate, for instance.1613\n\nR-PSVB, \u00b6 174.\n\nFor instance, Perenco provided the following information to DINAPA in 2007 with respect to the Oso A platform: \"On the Oso A platform and in reference to the pit system, the hydrogeological characteristics of the area have not been favourable due to the phreatic levels present; in other words, it was necessary to reduce the initial intended depth of 4.50 meters to 3 meters (a 40% reduction in capacity)\". Letter of 17 October 2007 from Eric D'Argentr\u00e9 (Perenco) to Consuelo Hern\u00e1ndez (DINAPA), p. 9 (**Exh. CE-CC-142**) ; Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 146.\n\nFor instance, Mr. Saltos confirmed that the phreatic level in the Blocks was between 1 and 3 meters deep. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1257:21-1258:2 (Cross, Saltos); Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 146.\n\nEcuador's Closing Statement, Slides 150-153, pointing to GSI ER1, Figure L.23.7 and Att. L.23.D.1 (for Payamino 14/20/24) and GSI ER2, App. L.02 (for Coca CPF/Coca 2). See also: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1024:4-1025:14 (Direct, Crouch). See also: RPS Opening Presentation, Slide 38. Ecuador further pointed to the 1991 Environmental Impact Assessment for Gacela 1, mentioning the \"low compactness of the soil\" allowing \"significant infiltrations\". EIA Gacela 1, February 1991, pp. 25-26 (**Exh. CE-CC-428**). Also: Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 154.\n\nGSI ER2, App. B, pp. 28, 32-34; IEMS ER4, Att. 11, p. 6.\n\n789.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that leachate samples must be tested against Table 7b if they come from pits with a synthetic liner or geomembrane, unless the liner is demonstrably defective. In this latter case, the samples must be tested against Table 7a. In case of doubt in this regard, the Tribunal considers it reasonable and appropriate to resort to the most environmentally protective standards of Table 7a.\n\n**5.3.7 Remediation methodology and cost**\n------------------------------------------\n\n790.\n\nFor pits containing weathered crude or which have been poorly managed, Article 59 of RAOHE provides that crude that cannot be recuperated will be treated either in the pit or *ex situ*, preferably through bioremediation.1614 It further stipulates that the site must be rehabilitated once the crude has been evacuated and the pit walls and floor comply with Table 6.1615 Solid wastes found in the pit must be disposed of temporarily in pits with a geomembrane with a recollection and leachate control system, while inorganic solid wastes shall be treated and recycled *ex situ*.1616\n\nRAOHE, Article 59(a.3) (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n*Id*., Article 59(a.5).\n\n*Id*., Article 59(a.6).\n\n791.\n\nIn application of Article 59, the Tribunal will thus assume *ex situ* bioremediation to compute remediation costs. Doing so, it will apply the same unit remediation cost as for regular soil, namely USD 300/m3, since the Parties did not put forward any specific cost estimates specifically relating to pit remediation.\n\n**5.3.8 Assessment of mud pits in the Blocks**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n792.\n\nEcuador essentially argues that all pits in the Blocks require remediation (to the exception of the pits built by Petroamazonas after July 2009), whereas Burlington argues that not a single pit needs to be remediated.1617 The Tribunal hence needs to analyze the results of the Parties' sampling. It notes here that the Parties diverge on the actual number of pits in the Blocks (226 for Ecuador1618 v. 156 for Burlington).1619 Be this as it may, the total figure does not appear pertinent in light of the sampling exercise undertaken by both Parties.\n\nGSI ER2, p. 10, Exhibit 3.\n\nReply, \u00b6 454; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 80; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009 (**Exh. E-563**).\n\nGSI ER1, App. B.5; GSI ER2, App. B.5. See also: R-PSVB, \u00b6 83.\n\n793.\n\nIEMS sampled mud pits at 37 platform and off platform sites (32 in Block 7 and 5 in Block 21), analyzing a total of 488 pit samples1620 and 126 samples from soil surrounding mud pits.1621 For its part, GSI collected 28 samples in 20 closed pits from 16 different platforms, of which 11 samples are leachate samples (including 2 duplicate samples) taken at seven sites (Coca 15, Lobo 3, Oso 9, Payamino 14/20/24, Yuralpa Pad A, Pad F and Pad G).1622 The other GSI samples are taken from the 30 cm clean soil layer covering mud pits.1623\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 29 and Att. 10.1. A review of GSI's data reveals that GSI held that IEMS collected pit samples at 47 sites, namely: Coca 1, 2/CPF, 4, 6, 8, 10/16, 11, 13, 15, 18/19, Payamino 2/8, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14/20/24, 15, 16, 19, Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Punino, C\u00f3ndor Norte, Gacela 2, 4, 5, Jaguar 1, 2, 3, 7/8, 9, Lobo 3, Mono 10, Mono Sur, Oso 3, Oso 9, Oso A, Oso CPF, Chonta, Dayuno, Nemoca, Sumino, Yuralpa Pad A, Pad B, Pad E, Pad G, and Yuralpa Sanitary Landfill. See: GSI ER1, App. L. In addition, it appears that IEMS suggested during the Site Visit, that Area 2M at Mono CPF was a pit, although Ecuador did not so argue. Tr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG), 87:19-21 (Tribunal, Chaves in Area 3MT at Mono CPF): \"And you see the topography: It is declining. The flow of the contamination comes from that, which is a pit, because the records\u2026\". For its part, Burlington argued that contamination in Area 2M was caused by mud discharges in 1989: \"How did it get here? We know exactly how it got here. In 1989, when BP drilled the Mono 1 well that's on the east side of the platform, in those days mud pits were not constructed. They had not been required yet, and so the practice by BP in those days, in 1989, was to simply discharge the drilling mud, the barium drilling mud, off the side of a platform\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG), 95:3-9 (Presentation by Ms. Renfroe in Area 3MT at Mono CPF).\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 29 and Att. 10.2.\n\nGSI ER1, p. 104 and App. D, Table D.12A. GSI also tested mud pits constructed by Petroamazonas at Yuralpa Pad F and Pad G. GSI ER1, p. 105 and App. D, Table D.12B. See also: IEMS ER4, p. 30.\n\nSee, for instance: GSI ER1, App. L, Tables L.2.3 (Coca CPF), L.6.3 (Coca 8), L.12.3 (Coca 15), L.13.3 (Coca 18/19), L.15.3 (Payamino 2/8), L.23.3 (Payamino 14/20/24) and L.54.3 (Oso 9).\n\n794.\n\nBecause mud pits must be tested against Table 7, as the Tribunal established earlier, and because IEMS tested its pit samples exclusively against Table 6, the Tribunal cannot consider IEMS's sampling for purposes of ascertaining the condition of the pits under Table 7. Indeed, the values under both tables are incompatible and cannot be transposed from one to the other, as both Parties agree.1624 The use of IEMS's mud pit data is therefore limited to determining whether the pits contain crude.\n\nBurlington stated that \"because the methodology of the two tables is so distinct, it is not possible to transpose data taken for evaluation on the basis of one table into data readable for purposes of the other\". CMCC, \u00b6 324. Ecuador responded that \"[t]he latter is, in fact, correct\". Reply, \u00b6 303.\n\n795.\n\nIn the absence of relevant data on the conditions of the majority of the pits, the Tribunal will focus on the specific instances where Ecuador alleged that environmental harm was caused by defective or poorly managed mud pits. The analysis will first turn on whether mud pits containing weathered crude require remediation and then assess the position with regard to allegedly poorly managed pits. Finally, the Tribunal will review GSI's leachate tests and determine whether these call for remediation.\n\n**\u0430. Pits containing weathered crude**\n--------------------------------------\n\n796.\n\nArticle 59 provides no answer to the question of what TPH value in pits calls for remediation. It appears clear to the Tribunal that relatively low TPH values do not justify remediation, i.e. values that fall within the permissible limits for regular soil under Table \u0431. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that prior operators were subject to a contractual remediation criteria set at TPH< 1%, corresponding to 10,000 mg/kg TPH.1625 The Parties did not articulate any specific values, although Ecuador took the position that all pits must be remediated back to sensitive ecosystem criteria, which cannot be correct if mud pits host industrial wastes. In the absence of any specification in the PSCs and in the light of the evolving standards for increased environmental protection, the Tribunal deems it reasonable to resort to the 4,000 mg/kg limit prescribed in Table 6 for industrial soil.\n\nGSI ER2, App. B.6 (for instance, Coca 4, Payamino 5, Chonta 1, Sumino 1, Nemoca 1, Yuralpa Centro 2, Coca 15 and Payamino 23).\n\n797.\n\nOn that basis and looking at IEMS's sampling data,1626 the Tribunal identified elevated TPH values in pits at the following sites: Coca 2,1627 Coca 8,1628 Jaguar 2,1629 Mono 10,1630 Oso 9,1631 Payamino Transfer Station/Sanitary Landfill,1632 Payamino 51633 and Dayuno.1634\n\nIn particular: IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1.\n\nAt Coca 2, the following pit samples have TPH exceedances: 7-COC02-SDB4-R(0.5-0.7)m (7'320.36 mg/kg) and 7-COC02-SDB4-R(0.3-0.4)m (6'728.45 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.2, p. 1; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.2.1.\n\nAt Coca 8, the following pit samples have TPH exceedances: 7-COC-08-N7-MS-F-2.2 (92'930 mg/kg), 7-COC-08-N7-MS-F-1.5 (103'140 mg/kg), 7-COC-08-N7-MS-D-0.5 (6'959.9 mg/kg) and 7-COC-08-TE-101-(1.5-1.7) (9'461 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, pp. 3-4; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.6.1. The Tribunal notes that Ecuador did not challenge GSI's contention that sample TE-101-(1.5-1.7) is located in the pit. See GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, p. 6.\n\nAt Jaguar 2, the following pit sample has a TPH exceedance: 7-JAG-2-N3-MS-A-1.5 (7'912 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 11; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.40.1, p. 3.\n\nAt Mono 10, the following pit sample has a TPH exceedance: 7-MON-10-N3-MS-A-1.0 (4'721 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 16; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.49.1, p. 2.\n\nAt Oso 9, the following samples have TPH exceedances: 07-OSO09-SDD3-R(1.4-1.6)m (4'020 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDB6-R(2.2-2.4) (4'084 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDC5-R(2.5-2.7)m (4'559 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SDC8-R(1.5-1.7)m (4'617 mg/kg), 07-COF05-SDA3-R(1.5-1.7)m (5'599.4 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDC7-R(2.5-2.7)m (6'106 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDC3-R(2.5-2.7)m (6'855 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDC4-R(2.5-2.7)m (8'081 mg/kg), 07-CPF05-SDF1-R(2.5-2.7)m (9'320.6 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SDD3-R(2.5-2.7)m (9'604 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDB5-R(2.4-2.6m (10'176 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SW05-R(1.0-1.2)m (10'598 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDB4-R(1.4-1.6)m (11'916 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SDD4-R(1.5-1.8)m (11'920 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SDE6-R(1.8-2.0)m (15'774 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SDD2-R(1.5-1.7)m (18'596 mg/kg) and 07-OSO09-SDD2-R(1.8-2.0)m (29'701 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, pp. 25-26; GSI ER1, App. Other IEMS samples identifying TPH exceedances, but without coordinates and which are located by GSI in the Oso 9 pits, are: 07-OSO09-SDX2-R(1,5-1,8)m (54'878 mg/kg) and 07-OSO09-SDY-2-R(2,0-2,2)m (4'026 mg/kg). Finally, GSI identified the following IEMS samples as pit samples: MS-OSO-C1-9.1-2,3 (10'165 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SDD2-R(1.5-1.7)m (18'596 mg/kg) and 07-OSO09-SDD2-R(1.8-2.0)m (29'701 mg/kg). See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.54.1.\n\nAt Payamino Transfer Station/Sanitary Landfill, the following pit sample has a TPH exceedance: 7-PAY-RES-999-MS-D-3.5 (5'956 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 31. In addition, GSI indicated that the following samples with high TPH levels were mislocated by IEMS and are in reality located in the pits on the southeastern edge of the platform: 7-PAY-RES-999-MS-A-1,5M (4'934 mg/kg), 7-PAY-RES-999-MS-A-2,5M (4'759 mg/kg) and 7-PAY-RES-999-MS-C-2.5 (91'207 mg/kg). According to GSI, \"GSI personnel inspected the area and encountered several abandoned soil borings in the southern portion of the platform. No evidence of borings was present in the areas defined by the [IEMS] Annex I coordinates\", further stating that the \"revised boring locations are consistent with the IEMS boring location identified in the field by GSI personnel. This revised location is also consistent with the description of sample locations in [IEMS] Annex C\". See: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 32 and App. L, Figure L.30.3. Although IEMS made some corrections in its fourth report, it appears that IEMS did not respond to GSI's specific explanations regarding the Sanitary Landfill. See: IEMS ER4, pp. 108-109 and Table 2. In light of GSI's explanations on borings and the fact that IEMS did not respond, the Tribunal is satisfied that the samples are in fact located in the two pits.\n\nAt Payamino 5, the following pit samples have TPH exceedances: 7-PAY-5-156-MS-F-2.1 (22'850 mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-G-2.1 (49'729 mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-G-0.5 (8'687.4 mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-G-1.5 (17'430 mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-H-1.5 (13'294 mg/kg) and 7-PAY-5-156-MS-D-1.1 (14'256.49 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 36 and Att. 10.2, p. 12; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.30.1. The Tribunal notes that Ecuador did not challenge GSI's assertion that sample 7-PAY-5-156-MS-D-1.1 is located in a pit. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.18.1.\n\nAt Dayuno, the following pit samples have TPH exceedances: 21-DAY01-SDD1-R(0,0-0,2)m (32'791 mg/kg), 21-DAY01-SDDO-R(0,0-0,2)m (30'932 mg/kg) and 21-DAY01-SDD1-R(1,4-1,6)m (38'310 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 39; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.59.1.\n\n798.\n\nAll wells at these sites were drilled by prior operators, with the exception of Oso 9 where the well was drilled by the Consortium in September 2005.1635 With respect to Oso 9, the Tribunal notes that the Consortium's pits have high levels of TPH, at some point even exceeding 54,000 mg/kg.1636 It is further undisputed that the Consortium used the pits at the Payamino Transfer Station/Sanitary Landfill and therefore remediation is warranted at that site. But except for Oso 9 and the Payamino Transfer Station/Sanitary Landfill, the Respondent has not alleged that the Consortium reused pits at the other sites just referred to.\n\nCoca 2 was drilled by CEPE in December 1988, although the pit closure date is unknown to both Parties. Coca 8 was drilled by Petroproducci\u00f3n in August 1991, but the pit closure date is unknown. Jaguar 2 was drilled by PB in December 1988, but the pit closure date is unknown. Mono 10 was drilled by Oryx in January 1997, but the pit closure date (for Mono10 and Mono 12) is unknown. Payamino 5 was drilled by Oryx in December 1991, and although the original closure date is unknown, the three closed pits containing oil-based muds were remediated in 1997. Dayuno was drilled by Esso Hispanoil in November 1987, but the pit closure date is unknown. See: GSI ER2, App. B.5; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009 (**Exh. E-563**).\n\nSee note 1631 above. See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 479.\n\n799.\n\nDuring the Site Visit, the Tribunal also had the opportunity to see the large trees and other vegetation covering the Coca 8 pits to the south of the platform, which appeared to confirm that these pits had not been reopened or reused by the Consortium. On that basis, the Tribunal can only dismiss Ecuador's claim for the remediation of TPH in mud pits, except for the pits containing TPH at Oso 9 and at the Payamino Transfer Station, which must be fully remediated.\n\n800.\n\nWith respect to Oso 9, the review of the location of the exceedance points reveals that all five central pits in the main pit area immediately to the south of the platform have TPH exceedances. Accordingly, all five pits must be completely remediated *ex situ*. The dimensions of the five pits are identical (approximately 53x14 meters) amounting to an impacted area for each pit of 742 m2 and, with a depth of 5 meters, to a total volume of soil of 3,710 m3 per pit.1637 Therefore, the total volume of soil in the five pits requiring remediation at that site is 18,550 m3, amounting to a total remediation cost of **USD 5,565,000**.\n\nThe Tribunal chose a depth of 5 meters in light of Perenco's explanation that they transferred the muds from Oso A to Oso 9 precisely because the depth at Oso A could only comport 3 meters due to the phreatic level instead of the 4.5 meters initially contemplated. See: Letter of 17 October 2007 from Eric D'Argentr\u00e9 (Perenco) to Consuelo Hern\u00e1ndez (DINAPA) (**Exh. CE-CC-142**). See also: Saltos WS1, \u00b6 184.\n\n801.\n\nWith respect to the Payamino Sanitary Landfill, two pits must be remediated up to 5 meters depth with an impacted area for the first pit of 720 m2 (40x18 meters) and a total soil volume of 3,600 m3, and an impacted area of 630 m2 and total soil volume of 3,150 m3 for the second pit (35x18 meters), for a total volume of 6,750 m3 to be remediated, and a total cost of **USD 2,025,000**.\n\n802.\n\nIn its review of IEMS's sampling data, the Tribunal further noticed that GSI states that various IEMS samples are misplaced and in reality located in pits,1638 a statement that Ecuador did not challenge.1639 This is the case at the following sites where high TPH values are identified: Gacela 2,1640 Punino,1641 and Oso CPF.1642 Again, all these pits were built by prior operators1643 and Ecuador has not alleged that they were re-used by the Consortium.1644 Accordingly, the Consortium is under no obligation to remediate these pits.\n\nSee, in particular: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2.\n\nIEMS ER4, pp. 108-109 and Table 2.\n\nThis is the case of sample MS-GAC-C1-2.1-1 with a TPH level of 34'907 mg/kg. The Tribunal notes that two other samples to the east of the pit have high TPH levels (namely, 07-GAC02-SDA2-R(1,0-1,2)m and 07-GAC02-SDA3-R(0,5-0,7)m). These exceedances are considered by the Tribunal in its analysis of regular soil contamination under Table 6 of RAOHE (see above note 1234). See also: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 11.\n\nThis is the case of sample 7-PUN-01-71-MS-H-3,0 with a TPH level of 6'590 mg/kg. The Parties agree that the Punino well was drilled in 1990 and that the site has one closed pit to the north of the platform. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.31.1 and Figure L.31.3. The Tribunal notes that sample MS-H is not identified in the map in Figure L.31.3, but it is otherwise satisfied that it is located in the pit on the basis of the sample ID (71-MS). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1 contains no reference to pit samples taken in Punino.\n\nThis is the case of sample 07-CPFOS-SDB8-R(2,1-2,3)m with a TPH level of 8'789 mg/kg and sample 07-CPFOS-SDZ5-R(2,5-2,7)m with a TPH level of 7'005 mg/kg. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.56.1. The sample locations are not identified in Figure L.56.3.\n\nGacela 2A was drilled by Oryx in 1992 with oil-based muds, and Gacela 2B in 1997. The Gacela 2 pits were closed in 1998. Punino was drilled by Petroproducci\u00f3n in 1990 and the pit closure date is unknown. Oso 1/CPF was drilled in 1970 according to GSI and, according to Ecuador, by BP in 1988; the closure dates of the 3 pits are unknown. See: GSI ER2, App. B.5; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009 (**Exh. E-563**).\n\nHowever, Ecuador stressed that Mr. Saltos conceded that Oso 1 was a stand-by well that was put into service by the Consortium following a workover. There is, however, no evidence showing that the Consortium reopened the Oso 1/CPF pits. See: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1239:1-2 (Cross, Saltos); R-PSVB, \u00b6 198.\n\n**b. Poorly managed pits**\n--------------------------\n\n803.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Ecuador's claim that pits were poorly managed. It will particularly review whether there is evidence that pits are leaking their contents into the surrounding environment. Ecuador refers to the following evidence in support of its claim. First, Messrs. Andrade and Ram\u00edrez, both Consortium staff, stated that individuals had complained of being affected by leaking pits at Coca 4, Oso A, Gacela 2 and Payamino 1.1645 Second, Mr. Saltos admitted that the Waponi-Ocatoe pit collapsed in 2003 and that the pit at C\u00f3ndor Norte partially collapsed in 2006.1646 Third, GSI testified that contamination related to past drilling mud discharges was found in two areas to the east of Mono CPF.1647 Fourth, IEMS indicated that the Payamino 2/8 pits are perforated by roots and leaking.1648 Fifth, GSI acknowledged that drilling muds extend to the south of the closed pit at Coca 8.1649 Sixth, Ecuador also alleges that the Coca 18/19 pits are releasing their content and that the Mono 10/12 pit is leaking.1650\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 482(a).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 482(b).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 482(c).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 482(e).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 482(d).\n\nReply, \u00b6 195(ii); R-PHB, \u00b6 482(f).\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal first turns to the allegedly leaking pits at Coca 4, Payamino 1, Oso A and Gacela 2.\n\n805.\n\nWith respect to Coca 4 and Oso A, Ecuador has not provided any specifics regarding the complaints mentioned by Messrs. Andrade and Ram\u00edrez and there are no other elements showing that the mud pits at Coca 4 and Oso A are leaking. Coca 4 has two pits and IEMS collected one sample from the pit to the southeast of the platform, with no exceedance even under Table 6.1651 The only exceedance at Coca 4 would appear to be related to the oil/water separator rather than to the mud pit, and does not support a finding that the pit in question is leaking.1652 Similarly, IEMS only took one sample from the Oso A pit and provided no clear information on how or where the alleged leaking is coming from.1653\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Table L.3.1 and Figure L.3.3.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nGSI ER1, App. L, Table L.55.1.\n\n806.\n\nWith respect to Gacela 2, the Tribunal notes that IEMS accepted that Portland cement mixed with oil-based drilling mud prevents TPH from migrating outside of the pit, although IEMS stressed that this was not the case of heavy metals.1654 GSI disagreed with IEMS's position that Portland cement does not stabilize heavy metals,1655 adding that the Gacela 2 pit at issue also had a plastic liner beneath it.1656 The Tribunal is not convinced that the exceedances surrounding the pit are due to a leak in the pit, as opposed to other causes such as spills during workovers. In particular, Oryx took samples from the Gacela 2 pit during the stabilization and solidification procedure in 1998 and the results show that heavy metals were properly fixated in the mixture.1657 This procedure was furthermore approved by Ecuadorian authorities.1658 Most importantly, the Tribunal notes that IEMS has provided no evidence suggesting that the pit is poorly constructed or any analysis on the pit's structure showing that there is a leak. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Ecuador's claims for remediating the pits at Gacela 2.\n\nIEMS stated the following: \"Portland cement. So, what that does specifically is work with the TPH, but it doesn't perform the same as with metals. And in the same study, for example, on the sealing of these two pits it clearly says that the risk may exist due to the base of metals highly associated with TPH, mainly in this case it cites vanadium, lead, and cadmium; that in the case of vanadium and cadmium we have the presence of highly significant contamination at this site. So, it may be very safe for TPH, for not perhaps for metals [sic]\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 18:33-19:5 (Tribunal, Chaves at Gacela 2).\n\nGSI stated as follows: \"In the other case with the solidified material, the TPH, the oil, and any metals that are in there are very securely stabilized. I would give you a point of view that's very opposite of what Mr. Chaves offered, that cementing completely retains the metals because Portland Cement is aluminium silicate and other agents that attract and tie those metals up. You don't get metals escaping that material\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 19:21-27 (Tribunal, Connor at Gacela 2).\n\nTr.

E-472**).\n\n807.\n\nWith respect to Payamino 1, and leaving aside the unreported workover pit in Area 2M which the Tribunal addressed in its analysis on contamination of regular soil, the Tribunal notes that the above-surface concrete pit in Area 1P inspected during the Site Visit was removed by the prior operator Oryx in 2001.1659 Accordingly, there is no issue of pit leakage at Payamino 1, since any exceedance surrounding or below the concrete pit forms part of the Tribunal's analysis of contamination of regular soil.\n\nGSI ER1, p. 101.\n\n808.\n\nSecond, with respect to collapsed pits, the Tribunal starts its analysis with the pits in Waponi-Ocatoe. Waponi-Ocatoe was drilled by Kerr McGee in 2000 and Ecuador does not know if it was operated by the Consortium.1660 The three mud pits on the southeastern edge of the platform were closed by Kerr McGee in December 2000. Ecuador alleged that two pits were lined, but could not provide information on the third, further arguing that \"[t]he use of a synthetic liner does not mean that it was properly installed, not damaged, and is effectively serving as an \"impermeable\" barrier\".1661 At the Hearing, for the first time, Mr. Saltos indicated that a pit in Waponi-Ocatoe collapsed in 2002 or 2003.1662 However, there are no other elements in the record providing information on the circumstances of the alleged collapse and the remedial action taken by the Consortium,1663 and Ecuador did not further comment on the matter in its PostHearing Brief.1664 The Tribunal further notes that IEMS did not take any sample from the mud pits or immediately adjacent areas to the mud pits, with the exception of four samples taken to the northeast of the northern most pit, which do not show any exceedance.1665 Indeed, IEMS concluded that the platform is free of soil contamination1666 and Ecuador does not claim remediation for this site.1667 Accordingly, no remediation is warranted for the Waponi-Ocatoe pit.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 72 (**Exh. E-563**).\n\n*Ibd.*\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1224:6-8 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nFor instance, even the field investigation conducted by IEMS does not mention the allegedly collapsed pit, but refers to an open pit with water discovered in 2010 by Envirotec (REC 21-WAP-WAP-453) and to some weathered crude on the platform close to a \"possible pit\".

E-500**).\n\n809.\n\nThe situation is different for C\u00f3ndor Norte, especially because the pits were built by the Consortium in 2005.1668 It is undisputed that an area of three pits partially collapsed in 20061669 and Mr. Saltos acknowledged that the Consortium did not properly remediate the situation prior to July 2009.1670 Although Mr. Saltos testified that the contents of the pits did not leak,1671 GSI stated otherwise.1672 It is also unclear whether the pits are properly lined.1673 The Tribunal does not accept the explanation of Mr. Saltos that the Consortium could not properly remediate the pits due to the takeover in July 2009,1674 since the 2008 abandonment plan makes no mention of problems with the pits and does not contemplate remediating the area.1675 Although it would be sufficient for a finding of liability that the pits were built by the Consortium, the Tribunal in addition finds that the C\u00f3ndor Norte pits were poorly built and managed.\n\nGSI ER2, App. B.5, p. 2; Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 36 (**Exh.

There are three closed pits at C\u00f3ndor Norte and the Consortium submitted an Abandonment Plan for C\u00f3ndor Norte in September 2005, which was approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.

(Day 4) (ENG), 1339:16-1340:1 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nMr. Saltos stated as follows: \"I maintain this, the pits of Conde [sic] Norte 1 never broke, they never had any run-off problems, the mud never came out of them\".

(Day 4) (ENG), 1339:3-15 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nGSI stated the following: \"A spill occurred at this site in 2005 when a corner of the mud pits failed, causing mud to run over the adjacent cliff. The pits were closed shortly thereafter, as the well never produced oil. The spill of about 300 barrels of mud reached a stream below. Perenco Ecuador Limited reported the spill and completed remediation\". GSI further stated that it \"conducted a visual/physical inspection at this location and found erosion and slope failure (landslide) of the pit area, but there was no evidence that the pits had been compromised\". GSI ER1, App. L.32 \u2013 C\u00f3ndor Norte 01, pp. 3, 5.\n\nThe 2005 mud pit closure offer mentions both Tables 7a and 7b of RAOHE. First, it is noted that composite samples are tested against Table 7b, but then it is stated that samples comply with Table 7a. Mud pit closure offer, project and report from Constructora Villacreces for C\u00f3ndor Norte (CP-00026612 \u2013 00026667), pp. 13, 21 (**Exh. E-460**). See also: Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 36 (**Exh. E-563**).

CE-CC-338**).\n\n810.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal holds that complete *ex situ* remediation of the three pits is due at this site, to a depth of 3 m, corresponding to a total area of 1,300 m2 (approx. 65 x 20 meters), for a total soil volume of 3,900 m3 and a total cost of **USD 1,070,000**.1676\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the 2005 pit closure offer refers to a total volume of 2,300m3, but in light of the dimensions of the pits (65 x 20 meters) and the depth at which IEMS identified elevated barium levels (up to 3 meters), the Tribunal reached a total volume of soil of 3,900 m3. See: Mud pit closure offer, project and report from Constructora Villacreces for C\u00f3ndor Norte (CP-00026612 \u2013 00026667), p. 32 (**Exh. E-460**) ; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.32.1.\n\n811.\n\nThird, Ecuador also alleges that GSI admitted that contamination found in the area to the east of Mono CPF was related to past drilling mud discharges.1677 The Tribunal already accepted in its analysis on regular soil at Mono CPF the statement of IEMS that Area 2M is a historical pit used by BP when drilling Mono 1 (see paragraph 688 above).1678 However, the Tribunal notes that IEMS's statement that the pit is leaking its contents into Area 3MT is speculative, since it is not supported by any evidence on the pit's structure showing that there is a leak. Accordingly, Ecuador's claim regarding the pit in Area 2M is dismissed.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 482(c).\n\nTr.

Similarly, Mr. Saltos stated that: \"I believe that the contamination was caused when the wall in the Payamino 2 test pits, built by CEPE in 1987, broke and the test crude and drilling muds flowed downhill and into the swamp\". Saltos WS2, \u00b6 93, see also: *Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 94, 236 and Saltos WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 215-233.\n\nR-PSVB, \u00b6 89 (Italics by the Tribunal).\n\n813.\n\nApart from pointing to a piece of fractured liner visible at the edge of the cliff at the Payamino 8 mud pit during the Site Visit,1683 which incidentally led the Parties to disagree on the exact dimensions of the pit, the Tribunal has received no evidence suggesting that the Payamino 8 pit is presently leaking. In particular, there was no sampling in the proximity of the pit, for instance, along the cliff above the Jungal swamp. The closest IEMS sample in the Jungal swamp is some 50 meters away.1684 Finally, IEMS's pit samples are not located at the eastern edge of the pit and, in any event, do not show any TPH exceedance and only one sample with a high barium value.1685 In the Tribunal's view, this evidence is insufficient for a finding that the pit is leaking. Accordingly, no remediation is granted for the Payamino 8 pit.\n\nTr.

See: IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Payamino 2/8, pp. 9-14; GSI ER1, App. L, Table 15.1.\n\n814.\n\nFifth, the Tribunal now turns to the three Coca 8 pits located to the south of the platform that were discussed during the Site Visit.1686 Ecuador complains that the Coca 8 pits are leaking.1687 For its part, GSI agrees that the contamination originated from the mud pits and was caused by an overflow when the pits were compacted during the closure process and not by leakage.1688 In response, IEMS rejected GSI's remediation proposal calling it \"unreasonable\" and further argued that even \"if they remediated, how long will we have to wait for that pit to continue leaking, to continue draining contamination and reach the point of having to be remade? Because it comes from the pit, that's obvious. So are we going to cover the wound with a bandage without healing it from within?\".1689\n\nTr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 80:8-123:16 (Coca 8).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 482(d).\n\nGSI stated as follows: \"Q. Is there any doubt as to where this contamination may have originated? Did it come from the mud pits? A. Yes, we believe it came from the mud pits. The mud pits contained oil-based drilling mud, which is a mixture of diesel with barite and other materials. Mr. Garc\u00eda Represa was correct in saying that there was TPH in that pit, but there are no TPH exceedances out here. There is only barium. Our understanding from looking at the records on this site is that at some point in time there was an overflow from that mud pit which followed the drain in this area, but all the data is consistent with that. We have superficial impacts from barium sulfate\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 87:14-22 (Tribunal, Connor at Coca 8).

In addition to various other cadmium exceedances, the Tribunal notes that sample 7-COC-08-TE-105-(0.5-0.70) has a cadmium level of 4.7 mg/kg and sample 7-COC-08-TE-105-(1.50-1.70) a cadmium level of 3.8 mg/kg. See: GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 6-7.\n\n817.\n\nFor IEMS, these results \"demonstrate a catastrophic failure of the Coca 8 pit, which has released hazardous contents into the surrounding sensitive environment\". IEMS attributes this state of affairs to the \"poor engineering and construction of the pits, combined with a lack of monitoring and maintenance\".1694\n\nIEMS ER4, pp. 37-38.\n\n818.\n\nGSI responds that the Coca 8 pits did not collapse and do not leak, since (i) physical inspection did not reveal \"exposed drilling materials, leaks, or seeps\", (ii) the impacted soils are \"solid materials, with no liquid-phase drilling mud or oil\", and (iii) there is no sign of disturbance of vegetation.1695 It also considered that IEMS sample TE-101 with the high TPH level was located in the pit, thus suggesting that IEMS got the dimensions of the pits wrong.1696 GSI therefore concluded that the soil impacts \"are most likely associated with a historical release of the pit contents, either during the pit operation or at the time of the closure process, which are the only times when the pit would have contained liquid or semi-solid materials\".1697\n\nGSI ER2, pp. 13-14.

Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 107:6-14 (Tribunal, Saltos at Coca 8).\n\n820.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the Tribunal is inclined to accept Ecuador's view that the Coca 8 pits are leaking and were poorly managed by the Consortium:\n\n\u2022 First, the Coca 8 pits do not have a synthetic liner, as GSI conceded when it testified that in its opinion the clay base provided sufficient impermeabilization.1703\n\n\u2022 Second, although the easternmost pit contains oil-based drilling muds, there are no TPH exceedances outside of the pit area,1704 which one may have expected to find if there had been an overflow.1705 In other words, Mr. Saltos's so-called \"sandwich effect\" leading to overflows during the compacting process was disproved, since there are no TPH exceedances southwards of the pit in Area 1M as Mr. Saltos expected.1706\n\n\u2022 Third, the exceedances to the south of the pit are heavy metal exceedances (i.e., barium, cadmium and lead), which, due to their mobility, could very well have leaked over the years into the surrounding environment.\n\n\u2022 Fourth, the Tribunal is not convinced by GSI's opinion that the exceedances are only superficial, since barium exceedances extend at least 1.4 meters deep and cadmium exceedances are at least 1.7 meters deep.1707\n\n\u2022 Fifth, IEMS pointed to a complaint filed on 22 March 2007 by Mr. Note\u00f1o, President of the community *Coraz\u00f3n del Oriente*, indicating that the three Coca 8 pits had been seriously affecting the surrounding environment, including the river Huachito.1708 While Mr. Saltos sought to downplay the significance of this type of complaint,1709 there is no indication that the Consortium ever acted upon that complaint to verify the environmental condition of the mud pits and surrounding areas.\n\nTr.

However, during the Site Visit, IEMS accepted GSI's dimensions of the pits, and thus accepted that sample TE-101 is located within the pit: \"If it weren't for the fact that they had a diagram, which we did not, we never would have known the actual dimensions of the pit\".

While Mr. Note\u00f1o argued that the area was \"destined for agriculture\", the Tribunal decided that Area 1M is located in a sensitive ecosystem for purposes of Table 6 of RAOHE, also keeping in mind the statement made by Mr. Saltos that while oilfield operations are ongoing, that area cannot be used by the private owners: \"In addition, this area over here is not used because compensation was paid previously by the private company for the operation of the platform. And while the operation of the platform is ongoing, they cannot use it\". Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 107:1-3 (Tribunal, Saltos at Coca 8).\n\nSee, for instance: Saltos WS1, \u00b6 360.\n\n821.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Consortium's management of these pits was inadequate and that Burlington is at least partly liable for the remediation of these pits. In the Tribunal's assessment, all three mud pits should be remediated *ex situ*, amounting to an impacted area of approximately 2,500 m2, a total volume of 7,500 m3 (depth 3m), and total costs of USD 2,250,000, of which Burlington shall pay half since the pits were not built by the Consortium,1710 i.e. **USD 1,125,000**.\n\nThe Tribunal has no information on the exact dimensions of the pits (except for Mr. Note\u00f1o's indication that each pit is 10-12 meters wide and long) (**Exh. E-285**), and therefore the Tribunal relied on the figures provided by GSI showing that the pit area is approximately 100x25 meters. Since IEMS sampled 2.5 meters deep, the Tribunal held that the pits were 3 meters deep. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.6.6.\n\n822.\n\nSixth, with respect to Coca 18/19, Ecuador argues that the four pits on the southern edge of the platform are releasing their contents,1711 insisting in particular on the alleged off platform exceedances to the southwest of the pits in the area designated by GSI as Area 1M.1712 In its first expert report, GSI delineated contamination in Area 1M by stating that \"the exact source of the apparent drilling mud discharge at Area 1M is unclear\",1713 to which Ecuador replied that \"[a] more logical conclusion would have been that the contamination is caused by leakage from the pits used by the Consortium\".1714 After reviewing the Coca 19 pit closure report,1715 GSI then expressed the view that there were two auxiliary pits located to the south of the platform, in addition to the four pits located on the platform, and that the exceedances identified by IEMS are actually located within the pits.1716 Burlington therefore submitted that no remediation was required at this site.1717\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 151-156; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 270-272, 482(f).\n\nIEMS ER3, Annex C, Coca 18/19, pp. 7, 9-20; IEMS ER4, Att. 37, p. 3 (\"GSI recognizes soil contamination in Area 1M; however, the contaminated area identified by GSI is much smaller than the one estimated by IEMS. The new samples show good correlation with the prediction of IEMS' modeling and confirm that the impacted area estimated by IEMS is more realistic than GSI's. From the data and modeling it can be inferred that the source of contamination is related to the existing pits at the south of this field in 2004 according to the pit closure report for Coca 19\").

On this basis, the Tribunal finds that the weight of the evidence is that the pits in Coca 19 are not leaking. Therefore no remediation is due for these pits.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, lines 13-14 (**Exh.

GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 44-45.\n\n824.\n\nSeventh and last, with respect to Mono 10/12, the Tribunal considers that, without more, a single sample with a relatively minor barium exceedance (765 mg/kg) located just outside the southern edge of the pit is insufficient to prove Ecuador's allegation that the pit is leaking, since barium could very well have spilled over during the closure process.1726 Therefore no remediation is due for this pit.\n\nSee: Reply, \u00b6 195(ii). See also: GSI ER2, p. 13.\n\n**c. Leachate test analysis**\n-----------------------------\n\n825.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the leachate tests, which GSI conducted at the following sites: Coca 15, Lobo 3, Oso 9, Payamino 14/20/24, Yuralpa Pad A, Pad F and Pad G.1727 A review of these leachate tests shows that there are no exceedances under either Table 7a or 7b at Lobo 3, Payamino 14/20/24, Yuralpa Pad F and Pad G.1728 Since the pit closure report for Coca 15 indicates that the pit was lined,1729 the results must be measured on Table 7b and they evince no exceedance.1730 Similarly, since Ecuador accepts that the pits in Yuralpa Pad A have been lined and there is no evidence that the liner is damaged,1731 there are no exceedances at this site when judged against Table 7b.1732\n\nGSI ER1, App. D, Table D.12.A.

As already mentioned above, the 23 Oso 9 pits were constructed by the Consortium and 20 of them were closed at the latest in October 2007.1733 According to GSI, there are three pits on the platform, nine pits to the south and another pit area yet further south of the platform. The Parties only sampled in the area hosting the nine pits to the south of the platform and, therefore, the Tribunal will concentrate on these pits.\n\nThe Parties agree that Oso 9 hosts 23 pits, including 20 closed pits and 3 open pits. See: Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 65 (**Exh. E-563**) ; GSI ER2, App. B.5, p. 2.\n\n827.\n\nAmong these nine pits, there is documentary evidence that four are lined with an impermeable base,1734 and Mr. Saltos confirmed that all pits in Oso 9 are in fact lined,1735 although he did concede that liners may have been removed in cases of pit failure.1736 GSI further stated that plastic liners are in fact visible at \"some of the pits\".1737\n\nLetter of 29 April 2008 from Eric D'Argentr\u00e9 (Perenco) to Marcelo Mata (DINAPA), p. 4 (**Exh. CE-CC-162**). Ecuador also accepts that the 2008 biennial audit confirms that a fifth pit is lined, although the Tribunal could not verify this since there is no clear information in that respect in the exhibits provided by the Parties. For instance, the verification list attached by Ecuambiente merely states that drilling muds and cuttings are treated in mud pits in the \"posterior part of the platform\", without specifying whether the pits are lined. See: Block 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008, p. 367 (**Exh. E-252**). For the other pits, Ecuador stated that \"[n]o evidence of liners could be found in relation to the other 18 pits. Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 \u2013 Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 65 (**Exh. E-563**). The Tribunal further notes that the leachate test taken from an Oso 9 pit for the 2006 biennial audit was compared to Table 7b for lined pits. See: Biennial Environmental Audit of Block 7, including the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, November 2006, Table 4-15, p. 70 (**Exh. CE-CC-182**) ; Saltos WS1, \u00b6 128.\n\nMr. Saltos also attached a picture of a lined pit at Oso 9. See: Saltos WS1, \u00b6 185; Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1346:4-5, 1347:8-10 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nMr. Saltos stated the following: \"Now, during the operations, at some points, there may have been an alteration of the condition of the geomembrane. That could have happened. And in those specific cases there was a possibility of resorting to Table 7a\", further explaining that: \"I must repeat, perhaps in one of the pits there might have been a failure, it may have been withdrawn, it could have happened. But the policy was to place them there always\". Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1346:6-10, 1347:11-14 (Cross, Saltos).\n\nGSI stated as follows: \"Plastic black liner was visible at the corners of some of the pits\". See: GSI ER1, App. L, GSI Site Inspection and Sampling Report, p. 4.\n\n828.\n\nThe handwritten field forms drawn up by GSI, filed following a document production order, provide the following indications: \"[Some of the pits have plastic liner; others no. But all contents tested by Perenco [are] shown to meet appl. Stds. of [\u2026] Table 7 \u2013 work conducted 2006-2007]\".1738 In light of this statement and because Burlington did not specify which pits are lined, the Tribunal will apply Table 7a to GSI's leachate samples.\n\nField notes, forms, maps and checklists of GSI Environmental \u2013 First campaign (produced by Burlington on 14 November 2012), Oso 09 Inspection Checklist 2, p. 5 (**Exh.

(Day 4) (ENG), 1347:15-1348:11 (Cross, Saltos); R-PHB, \u00b6 467.\n\n829.\n\nThe leachate results for the northernmost pit at Oso 9 show a barium level of 22 mg/l for sample OS09-1P-01-1.5-1.7 exceeding both Table 7a and 7b.1739 In addition, sample OS09-1P-02-0.8-1.8 has a pH value of 10. While just at the limit, this requires no extra remediation since that pit must in any event already be remediated because of the presence of TPH (see above paragraphs 797-798). Finally, sample OS09-1P-03-1.0-2.4 has a level of electrical conductivity of 5,600 pmhos/cm, above the 4'000 pmhos/cm limit of Table 7a. In consequence, barium remediation is required for the northernmost pit and electrical conductivity for the southeasternmost pit, in addition to the TPH remediation already ordered above for the five centrally located pits (see above paragraph 800).\n\nGSI re-analyzed sample OS09-1P-01-1.5-2.7 with a barium level of 21 mg/l. See: GSI ER1, App. D, Table D.12.A, note 8, App. L, Table L.54.6.A and Figure L.54.5.\n\n830.\n\nIn view of the high level of barium, the Tribunal finds that *ex situ* remediation is appropriate in the circumstances for the northernmost pit, which represents an impacted area of 629 m2 (37x17 meters) for a total volume of 2,516 m3 (4 meter depth), and a total cost of **USD 754,800**. Finally, the Tribunal grants **USD 540,000** to remediate the pit (30x15x4) containing the electrical conductivity exceedance. In sum, the Tribunal grants a total amount of **USD 1,294,800** to remediate the pits in Oso 9.\n\n**d. Unreported pits**\n----------------------\n\n831.\n\nFurther, as the Tribunal has already stated, the Consortium also is responsible for the remediation costs associated with unreported mud pits, in particular the five unreported pits at Payamino 16.1740 Mr. Saltos conceded that the Payamino 16 pits were reopened to deposit drilling muds from other platforms and that these five pits, which GSI was able to locate on the northwest of the platform, were not reported to the authorities.1741 Mr. Saltos indicated that the dimensions of these five auxiliary pits were three to four meters by two meters each and two to three meters deep, amounting to an impacted area of 35 m2 and a total volume of 87.5 m3. Accordingly, the Tribunal grants an amount of **USD 26,250** to remediate the unreported pits at Payamino 16.\n\nIn addition to the workover pit in Payamino 1, which the Tribunal addressed in its analysis on regular soil contamination, Ecuador has specifically alleged the existence of unreported pits only at Payamino 16.

GSI ER1, App. L, Payamino 16, GSI Site Inspection Report, p. 3.\n\n**e. Re-opened and re-used pits**\n---------------------------------\n\n832.\n\nSince Mr. Saltos confirmed at the Hearing that the Consortium re-used the mud pit at Jaguar 9 to store muds from other platforms,1742 the Tribunal verified the condition of that pit, although Ecuador makes no specific claim with respect to that pit other than to include it in its general claim that all pits need to be removed.1743 As the samples taken by IEMS show that the pit contains no crude oil, relatively low levels of barium, and no other elevated heavy metals concentrations,1744 the Tribunal finds that no remediation is required for this pit.\n\nTr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1335:4-12 (Cross, Saltos); R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 474, 485(b), 724-725. Ecuador further pointed to Payamino 16 and Oso 9 as further examples where the Consortium stored muds from other platforms. R-PHB, \u00b6 724. The pits in these locations are dealt with above.\n\nSee, for instance: R-PHB, \u00b6 474.\n\nIEMS ER3, Annex C, Jaguar 9, pp. 10-14. IEMS took no further samples at that site during its fourth campaign. See also: GSI ER1, App. L, Table 43.1 and Figure L.43.3; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 44-45.\n\n**f. Closure of open and unused pits**\n--------------------------------------\n\n833.\n\nFinally, Burlington accepts that four open and unused pits at Coca 8, Coca 4 and Payamino 5 must be closed for a total cost of **USD 68,000**.1745 Ecuador did not challenge this amount. Accordingly, the Tribunal grants this amount to backfill the pits with clean soil and re-vegetate the area.\n\nGSI ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 243 and 248; GSI ER2, \u00b6 141 and Exhibit 28.\n\n834.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal determines that Burlington is liable for the remediation costs of mud pits at Oso 9, Payamino Sanitary Landfill, C\u00f3ndor Norte, Coca 8 and Payamino 16, as well as for the cost of closing the four unused pits at Coca 8, Coca 4 and Payamino 5, for a total amount of **USD 11,174,050**.\n\n**6. Groundwater**\n------------------\n\n**6.1 Ecuador's position**\n--------------------------\n\n835.\n\nEcuador claims that the groundwater is contaminated at all the 18 sites it tested and thus seeks compensation for the remediation costs.1746 As a general matter, Ecuador alleges that the Consortium,1747 as well as GSI in the context of the present arbitration, ignored the need to protect water resources, which is particularly worrying in light of the population's dependence on ground and surface water at home and for their livestock.1748 Ecuador further submits that, since IEMS was not in a position to determine background values, it relied on the standards set out in TULAS Annex 1 (Table 5), which was also used by GSI.1749 On that basis, IEMS found heavy metal contamination (zinc, barium, copper, chrome and nickel) at all 18 sites and contamination with hydrocarbons at six sites.1750\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 293-294; Reply, \u00b6 219; R-PHB, \u00b6 507; R-PSVB, \u00b6 168; IEMS ER3, p. 164 and Annexes J.1-J.3; IEMS ER4, pp. 73-79. In total, IEMS collected 115 groundwater samples during its four sampling campaigns (12 during the first campaign, 49 during the second campaign, 30 during the third campaign and 24 during the fourth campaign) at the following 18 sites: Payamino 1, Payamino 2/8, Payamino 4, Payamino 13, Payamino 14, Payamino 15, Coca 2, Coca CPF, Oso 9, Gacela 1, Gacela 2, Gacela CPF, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2 and Mono CPF in Block 7; and the Yuralpa Waste Management Area, Dayuno and Waponi in Block 21. Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 67; R-PHB, \u00b6 511.\n\nEcuador explains, for example, that no groundwater samples were collected for the 2002, 2006 and 2008 biennial audits undertaken by the Consortium.

At the Hearing, RPS explained human water consumption needs as follows: \"It is common sense that with respect to Block 7 and Block 21, people could also contact subsurface soils, use water, groundwater domestically, and use surface water domestically. Livestock could also be contacting subsurface soils and drink water in streams and creeks. It's also common sense that ecological exposure is possible\". Tr.

(Day 3) (ENG), 676:5-10 (Direct, Alfaro); R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 513, 553-554. The Tribunal notes that Ecuador initially alleged the existence of contamination with hydrocarbons in the groundwater at Payamino 2/8, but then stated at the Hearing that TPH exceedances exist in six locations. With respect to the first results at Payamino 2/8, the Tribunal further notes that although the table in IEMS 3rd ER, p. 160 mentions TPH exceedances in Payamino 2 and 8, the conclusion states \"Hydrocarbon contamination was not found\" (at p. 164).\n\n836.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, Burlington's allegation that the groundwater claim is the consequence of flawed field procedures is \"unfounded and unsupported\".1751 Ecuador refutes Burlington's critique of IEMS's sampling procedure,1752 starting with the observation that GSI only tested 15 facilities for groundwater contamination.1753 Ecuador also contends that GSI failed to assess numerous locations with contamination on the \"misguided pretext\" that IEMS samples were taken from soil with 25% clay content and thus not subject to regulatory control.1754 Since the geologic logs on which GSI relied do not determine the percentage of clay at a given location,1755 GSI failed, according to Ecuador, to undertake any studies assessing the clay content in the areas where groundwater was tested. Ecuador further argues that, even if the content were above 25%, this would not mean that \"this same clay content extends to the depths at which groundwater may be found and wells accordingly drilled\".1756\n\nReply, \u00b6 218.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 219.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 509, 516-518. Ecuador explains that GSI failed to collect groundwater samples in Dayuno and Waponi Ocatoe due to purported \"access limitations\", and in the Yuralpa Waste Management Area on the pretext that it did not encounter groundwater, although IEMS managed to retrieve five samples at that location.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 519, 534-538.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 536.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 535; Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 677:7-22 (Direct, Alfaro). The Tribunal notes that the English transcript does not accurately translate Mr. Alfaro's testimony, when it is said that \"GSI correctly concludes that there is no contamination of groundwater\". The original Spanish version reads in relevant part: \"*GSI concluye incorrectamente que no hay contaminaci\u00f3n del agua subterr\u00e1nea*\". See: Tr. (Day 3) (ESP), 714:13-715:9 (Direct, Alfaro).\n\n837.\n\nEcuador also states that GSI improperly dismissed IEMS's samples on the erroneous basis that they should have been filtered.1757 Specifically, Ecuador argues that filtering samples is not in \"accordance with Ecuadorian regulations\", since it leads to biased results, in particular by removing colloidal particles which may have contaminants.1758 In this context, GSI relied on Annex 5 of RAOHE, when that regulation does not apply to groundwater but only to surface waste water.1759 Groundwater, by contrast, according to Ecuador, is regulated by TULAS, which does not require filtration of samples.1760\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 519.\n\nReply, \u00b6 160; R-PHB, \u00b6 540; RPS ER2, p. 23.\n\nReply, \u00b6 159; IEMS ER4, p. 76. IEMS stated: \"RAOHE only regulates water quality for superficial water bodies and wastewater discharges, but not groundwater. The methods listed in RAOHE, which require filtration, are intended for analysis of these types of waters, but not of groundwater. This is due to the differences in water chemistry and other physical parameters. Surface water for example is often highly turbid and contains organic matter while groundwater on the other hand often has much higher levels of dissolved solids, and lower levels of organic matter. These differences can make sample preparation much different to accomplish\".\n\nReply, \u00b6 159. Ecuador further states that TULAS expressly provides that analyses of groundwater samples for arsenic, cyanide and mercury should be \u2018total' analyses, i.e. not filtered. Moreover, TULAS requires that groundwater sampling be done according to specific standards set by the Ecuadorian Standardization Institute, which provide for the analyses of \u2018total metals', i.e. not filtered. See: IEMS ER3, Section 3.3; RPS ER2, Section 3.4, p. 22.\n\n838.\n\nWith respect to filtering, Ecuador argues that Burlington's reference at the Hearing to the INEN guidelines to support the use of 0.45pm filters is incorrect.1761 Indeed, RPS confirmed that these guidelines apply to surface not groundwater sampling.1762 In addition, IEMS indicated that it tested for the total concentration of heavy metals, including colloidal and suspended fractions, and not for their dissolved concentration, thus making the use of 0.45 pm filters a \"fundamental methodological error by GSI\".1763 As IEMS stated, \"[f]iltering the samples prior to acidification would result in only the dissolved fraction being analyzed, and produce erroneously low results\".1764 In any event, although IEMS opined that using 0.45 pm filters would have \"resulted in a serious manipulation of the samples\",1765 IEMS considered filtering its samples when turbidity was greater than 5 NTUs (nephelometric turbidity units),1766 and IEMS took both filtered and unfiltered samples on two separate occasions, i.e. in December 2012 and January 2013, where filtering showed no significant impact on the results.1767 In addition, Ecuador indicates that IEMS collected non-turbid, unfiltered and contaminated samples from 6 facilities in Block 7, namely Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Payamino 13, Payamino 15, Gacela 1 and Payamino 14.1768\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 547.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 548, referring to: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1113:19-22 (Cross, Crouch) (\"[\u2026] if you're collecting a surface-water sample, standard protocol is to collect those and use a.45-micron filter.

Ecuador further explains that \"IEMS' sampling plan was to collect samples after purging if turbidity was less than 5 NTUs, and if greater than 5 NTUs, to collect the samples when NTUs and other parameters had been stabilized. Nonetheless, according to the USEPA, \u2018*natural turbidity in groundwater may exceed 10 NTU*.' Hence, where the natural turbidity in the monitoring wells exceeded 5 NTUs, it was simply not possible for IEMS to collect samples with lower NTUs given that groundwater will not \u2018*clear up*' at the moment of sampling. Therefore, stabilization criteria calls for expecting a minimal change between two turbidity measurements, even in excess of 5 NTUs\" (emphasis in the original).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 161, 220.\n\nEcuador's Closing Statement, Slides 167-168; IEMS Field Notes (**Exh. E-483**). For Ecuador, the fact that the January 2013 samples showed lower concentrations of contaminants \"could be the result of dilution due to heavy rains that happened during the days that the sampling was being performed\". Reply, \u00b6 161.\n\n839.\n\nEcuador further rejects GSI's contention that TPH or drilling muds cannot dissolve in groundwater by pointing to TPH contamination in groundwater at six facilities in Block 7, namely Coca CPF, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Payamino 13 and Payamino 2/8.1769 Among these, Ecuador particularly points to Coca CPF where there is a thick sand aquifer and where the wells are adjacent to pits, thus unsurprisingly showing groundwater contamination.1770 In this context, Ecuador stresses that GSI conceded at the Hearing that fresh crude has a soluble portion. And IEMS indicated that GSI failed to measure TPH as per TULAS provisions, since the laboratory was instructed to divide the hydrocarbons in three different parameters, i.e. Gasoline Range Organics, Diesel Range Organics and Oil Range Organics, instead of considering the sum of the total petroleum hydrocarbons.1771\n\nEcuador's Closing Statement, Slide 169; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 526, 553-554.\n\nEcuador's Closing Statement, Slide 170.\n\nIEMS ER4, pp. 73-74. IEMS points, for instance, to GSI sample COCPF-GW1 showing 0,047 mg/l for GRO, 0.22 mg/l for DRO and 0.26 mg/l for ORO, for a total of 0,527 mg/l TPH in excess of the TULAS limit of 0,325 mg/l.\n\n840.\n\nFor Ecuador, GSI's attempts to downplay the risk of groundwater contamination are ill-founded. The studies on which it relies were undertaken in arid regions and do not apply to Blocks 7 and 21 with far higher average annual rainfall. Mr. Saltos confirmed at the Hearing that the groundwater in the Oriente is found close to or just below the surface.1772 GSI also failed to consider the seasonal effect on groundwater contamination and dilution.1773 In the same vein, Burlington's explanation that the thick, compact layer of clay found in the Blocks prevents contamination caused by oilfield operations from reaching the groundwater is contradicted by the record. GSI's own field logs show the presence of sand and silt layers at multiple locations, such as Coca CPF and Coca 2 which are underlain by a sand layer.1774 Various environmental impact studies undertaken by prior operators of Block 7 also \"disprove this notion of a thick, uniform layer of protective clay being present throughout the Blocks\".1775 In addition, Mr. Chaves explained that platforms are built on highly porous materials that facilitate infiltration.1776\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 523, referring to: Tr.

It is very likely that the real costs of implementing groundwater remediation would be higher than IEMS' estimates in the tropical setting\". IEMS ER4, p. 122.\n\n**6.2 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n842.\n\nBurlington submits that there is no groundwater contamination in the Blocks and that Ecuador's allegations of contamination are entirely a product of faulty testing procedures.1783 In any event, the Site Visit confirmed that residents in the Blocks have \"absolutely no need to exploit underground water\", since they mostly rely on rainwater.1784 According to Burlington, IEMS's alleged findings are \"inconsistent with oilfield operations\", since minerals used in drilling operations \"exhibit very low levels of solubility and mobility\", thus rarely causing impacts to water quality.1785 Burlington essentially argues that Ecuador \"ignored its own regulations\"1786 and that IEMS applied improper sampling techniques in areas with clay content above 25% and failed to filter its samples.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 334; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 153; GSI ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99 and Exhibit 22.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 201; C-PSVB, \u00b6 50.

IEMS thus tested sediment suspended in the water and not groundwater itself.1800\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 148.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 144.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 338; GSI ER1, \u00b6 81.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 338; Rejoinder, \u00b6 144; GSI ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 83-85.\n\n846.\n\nFurthermore, Burlington stresses that Ecuador's criticism of GSI's filtration is inconsistent with Ecuador's other assertion that filtration made little difference in the results.1801\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 143.\n\n847.\n\nMoreover, Burlington refers to RPS's statement at the Hearing that it took no issue with filtering *per se*, but that it objected to the filter size used by GSI.1802 It argues that Ecuadorian regulations require the size of the filter, namely, 0.45pm, employed by GSI.1803 Specifically, Burlington refers to Section 5 of Annex 1 of Book VI of TULAS (and not anymore RAOHE Annex 5), which applies to surface water, freshwater, as well as groundwater.1804 This regulation cites to NTE INEN 2169:98,1805 which in turn mandates the use of 0.45pm filters \"for all metals at issue in this case\".1806\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 152.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 155.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 155-156, referring to: INEN 2169:98, Table 1 (**Exh. CE-CC-349**). Burlington explains that the \"entry for \u2018Aluminium' in Table 1 states \u2018filtraci\u00f3n en el lugar del muestreo' [\u2018leakage in the sampling place'] and the entries for all other metals except for mercury, arsenic, and cyanide state \u2018ver aluminio' [\u2018see aluminum']\".\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 156.\n\n848.\n\nIn addition, Burlington argues that Ecuador's reference to a single unfiltered sample collected by Oryx in 1996 cannot disprove the appropriateness of GSI's filtration, since that sample was collected before RAOHE or TULAS came into force.1807 Burlington also points to the fact that IEMS's additional testing in January 2013 showed lower results,1808 and that Ecuador's explanation that this might be due to increased rainfall fails since the concentration of one analyte \u2013 cobalt \u2013 actually increased and the rainfall was higher in January 2013 than in December 2012.1809\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 150.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 142, referring to: IEMS ER4, Att. 31.2 (January 2013 groundwater sampling results).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 152.\n\n849.\n\nIn respect of the objection raised by RPS that GSI insufficiently analyzed the presence of TPH in groundwater, Burlington calls attention to the fact that RPS accepted IEMS's conclusion at the Hearing that no hydrocarbon contamination was found:1810\n\n\"Q.

(Day 4) (ENG), 1104:14-17 (Cross, Crouch).\n\n850.\n\nFinally, with regard to Ecuador's discussion of surface water contamination during the Site Visit, Burlington stresses that such contamination is \"beyond the record evidence and the scope of the Tribunal's decision making\", since Ecuador asserted no claim for surface water contamination and that there is in any event no evidence in the record of such contamination or any health risks attributable to surface water.1812 Specifically, Ecuador's claim that the Jungal swamp at Payamino 2/8 communicates with the Payamino River is an unsupported new allegation, which the Tribunal should not consider.1813\n\nC-PSVB, \u00b6 50; GSI ER2, \u00b6 172.\n\nC-PSVB, \u00b6 51.\n\n**6.3 Discussion**\n------------------\n\n851.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by setting out the legal framework for groundwater remediation (6.3.1). It will then address the areas of contention between the Parties, namely the experts' sampling procedures (6.3.2), the need for groundwater remediation in clayey soils (6.3.3), and filtration (6.3.4). Finally, the Tribunal will discuss remediation costs (6.3.5).\n\n**6.3.1 Legal framework**\n-------------------------\n\n852.\n\nThe Parties agree that TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5 (\"TULAS Table 5\") sets forth the quality criteria for groundwater,1814 which reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Excerpt of TULAS Table 5** |\n| **Parameter** | **Expressed** **as** | **Unit** | **Maximum permissible limit** |\n| Arsenic (total) | As | ug/l | 35 |\n| Barium | Ba | pg/l | 338 |\n| Cadmium | Cd | pg/l | 3.2 |\n| Cyanide (total) | CN- | pg/l | 753 |\n| Cobalt | Co | pg/l | 60 |\n| Copper | Cu | pg/l | 45 |\n| Total Chromium | Cr | pg/l | 16 |\n| Mercury (total) | Hg | pg/l | 0.18 |\n| Nickel | Ni | pg/l | 45 |\n| Lead | Pb | pg/l | 45 |\n| Zinc | Zn | pg/l | 433 |\n| Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons |  | pg/l | 325 |\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 512-513; IEMS ER2, p. 26; GSI ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 87, 181 and App. D, Table D.13; GSI ER2, Section 4.0; GSI's Direct Presentation, Slide 68. The Tribunal notes that Table 5 expresses units in pg/l, but the Parties have assessed their samples in mg/l. For instance, TPH value in TULAS is 325 pg/l, corresponding to 0,325 mg/l.\n\n853.\n\nMoreover, Article 4.1.3.6 of TULAS specifies that any \"proven alteration\" of groundwater must be remediated. Section 5 further provides that groundwater concentrations must be determined by considering NTE INEN Guidelines 2169:98 and 2176:98, which include specifications for filtration methodology.\n\n854.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the relevance of RAOHE for groundwater contamination. Ecuador argues that ROAHE is irrelevant and that the reference to filtration in Annex 5 only applies to surface waters or effluents, not to groundwater. Burlington replies that no such limitation exists in RAOHE, and notes that Article 16 RAOHE, for instance, refers to groundwater.\n\n855.\n\nAnnex 5 RAOHE spells out certain testing methods for waters, soils, and air emissions. Regarding waters, Annex 5 specifies that when analyzing barium, total chromium, lead and vanadium, samples must be filtered and acidified.1815 This suggests that filtration of samples as such is an approved, and indeed a required, element of testing. Another question is whether RAOHE applies to groundwater. Article 16 relating to the monitoring of remediation programs mentions both surface waters and groundwater. Similarly, the glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines, aquifers (as extending to groundwater) as well as \"groundwater\" or \"phreatic level\" (Translation by the Tribunal). These references tend to demonstrate that Ecuador's limited reading of RAOHE is incorrect and that RAOHE provides support for filtration of groundwater samples.\n\nRAOHE, Annex 5 reads in relevant part: \"Filtration and acidification of the sample, direct determination by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)\" (Translation by the Tribunal) (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n**6.3.2 Sampling procedures**\n-----------------------------\n\n856.\n\nDuring its first two sampling campaigns, IEMS did not measure various key elements, such as turbidity, pH, electric conductance, temperature, or total dissolved solids. It stated indeed that it started doing so after its first two field trips.1816 Moreover, the use of hand-sawn rather than machined well screens does not appear in line with standard practice. As a consequence, the Tribunal does not find the results from these two field trips reliable and will thus discard them.\n\nIEMS ER3, Annex A.10, p. 3, paragraph 6.\n\n**6.3.3 Testing in clayey soils**\n---------------------------------\n\n857.\n\nThe next question is whether groundwater testing is warranted in soils with clay contents exceeding 25%. TULAS Table 5 applies to soils with clay content between 0 and 25% and organic material content between 0 and 10%.1817 Accordingly, GSI appears to be correct when stating that no groundwater remediation is required at all where the clay content is above 25%, mainly because such soils are \"not capable of producing groundwater in sufficient quantities (due to low permeability) or of appropriate natural quality (due to mineral or organic content) to serve as a usable water supply for domestic, agricultural, or industrial use\".1818 Hence, TULAS Table 5 restricts the applicability of groundwater quality criteria to soils capable of producing groundwater.\n\nThe title of Table 5 reads: \"Reference quality criteria for groundwater, considering a soil with clay content between (0-25.0)% and organic material content between (0-10.0)%\" (**Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0002**).\n\nGSI ER1, D.19 (GSI-CMC App D 0058); GSI ER2, \u00b6 101.\n\n858.\n\nIEMS concedes that TULAS Table 5 does not apply to clayey soils above 25%. It also testified that \"a number of monitoring wells may be located in areas with a content of clay greater than 25%, and that therefore the TULAS regulation may not apply\".1819 Quite astonishingly, IEMS then continues asserting that background values apply if Table 5 is inapplicable.1820 As GSI rightly pointed out, clayey soils protect groundwater better than permeable sandy or silty soils. Thus, applying stricter standards to such soils would make no sense, especially in the absence of express wording to that effect in TULAS.1821 Accordingly, the Tribunal understands that TULAS Table 5 does not apply to soils with a clay content above 25%. Consequently, no groundwater remediation is called for in such areas. This finding requires the Tribunal to determine, next, which sites are therefore excluded from groundwater remediation.\n\nIEMS ER4, p. 77.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nGSI ER2, \u00b6 105.\n\n859.\n\nGSI indicated that 30 out of 46 IEMS groundwater sampling locations (at 18 sites), i.e. over 65%, are reported as having clayey or silty soils.1822 This said, the measurable indications in the record of the clay content of the soils where groundwater samples were taken are sparse at best. IEMS's notes from its third field trip do not specify the percentage of clay in the soils.1823 Neither have the Parties made their submissions on the basis of concrete levels of clay content. Only GSI's observations for its own sample locations \u2013 often at a considerable distance of IEMS sample locations \u2013 provide some relevant data.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 101, 112 and App. F.4. In its first report, GSI argued that 56% of IEMS groundwater sampling locations had \"primarily clay\" as soil composition. See: GSI ER1, \u00b6 86.\n\nIEMS Field Notes (**Exh. E-483**). See also: GSI ER2, App. F.4.2.\n\n860.\n\nGSI's field notes do not specify consistently a precise percentage of clay. Yet, as noted, they do contain some useful information. For its groundwater sampling at Jaguar 1 (boring well JA01-GW1), for instance, GSI indicated that soil between 0.0-0.3 and 0.32.0 meters is silty clay, suggesting no groundwater testing warranted there,1824 and that turbidity was lowered to 353 NTU (down from 777 NTU, suggesting need for filtering, as will be seen further below).1825 As a further illustration, the Payamino 14-20-24 GSI field form is more precise: at sample location PAY14-GW1, soil between 0.0-0.8 meters is clayish (\"*arcilla ligera*\") and soil between 0.8-1.8 meters is sandy (\"*arena pobremente graduada*\"), groundwater testing being warranted at this site.1826 A third example shows that the composition of the soil may vary according to layers. The GSI boring log at Payamino 1 (sample PAY01-GW1) states that the soil between 0.0-0.3 and below 0.5 meters is clayish (usually 100% and 90% between 1.4-1.8 meters) and that the soil layer between 0.3-0.5 meters is sandy (80%).1827\n\nJaguar 1 Field Form, Phase 1 (**Exh. E-476**). If the Tribunal's reading is correct, soil between 0.00.3 meters is 100% fine particulate (clay) and soil between 0.3-2.0 meters is 60% fine particulate and 40% with larger grain size. The field form reads: \"0.0-0.3: Greenish Gray, Moderately Humid, 100% fines, medium/low plasticity, no odor, silty clay (CL). 0.3-2.0 m: Light brown, saturated, 60% fines and 40% coarse material, hard ran.

E-476**).\n\n861.\n\nGSI has provided field forms from its groundwater sampling campaigns in respect of 12 sites.1828 For these sites, on the basis of the information provided by GSI, the Tribunal concludes that no groundwater testing is warranted due to clay contents above 25% at Payamino 1, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Gacela CPF, Gacela 2 and Yuralpa Sanitary Landfill. The Tribunal further concludes that the clay content is lower than 25% and that groundwater testing is therefore needed at the following sites: Coca 2, Coca CPF, Payamino 4, Payamino 13, Payamino 14/20/24 and Gacela 1/8. With respect to Payamino 15, the Tribunal notes that groundwater is found at the surface level with a 2-meter clay layer, but that sandy soil is found 2 meters below. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts to consider samples taken at depths below 2 meters.\n\nGSI Field Forms (**Exh. E-476**).\n\n862.\n\nAmong the sites at which IEMS tested for groundwater, GSI did not provide groundwater sampling forms for Payamino 2/8, Mono CPF, Oso 9, Dayuno and Waponi-Ocatoe. Because the field forms for soil contamination at Payamino 2/8 show the presence of clayey soil and the samples were taken within a swampy area (i.e., the Jungal swamp),1829 the Tribunal is inclined to hold that the clay content of the soil is above 25%. The same applies to Mono CPF, where the field forms for 14 soil sampling locations, mostly mention a soil composition of clay or silty clay and only rarely mention the presence of sandy silt.1830 With respect to the other sites, i.e. Oso 9, Dayuno and Waponi-Ocatoe, the Tribunal rejects IEMS's data, because Ecuador did not provide evidence of the soil content at these locations, which makes it impossible to determine whether groundwater sampling conforms to TULAS Table 5.1831\n\nPayamino 2/8 Field Form, Phase 2 (**Exh. E-476**). The field form provides information on two soil sampling locations in Area 2MT. For sample PA28-2MT-2B, the field form indicates as follows: \"(0.0-1.0): Brown silty clay (CH); mud to high plast, mod stick, \"sticky\", no chem odor, mod clay moist content; increasing plasticity with depth. (1.0-2-0): Orange-brown clay (CH); with minor silt content, high plasticity, \"sticky\"; mod stiff, low-mod clay moist content, gray mottling, no chem odor\". For sample PA28-2MT-3B, the field form states: \"(0.0-0.5m): Dark grey coarse sand combined with gravel. Material resembles same soil as the one used to fill the wellpad. (0.50.9m): Grey silty sand of medium-grain size. Homogeneous consistency. Low cohesion. Resembles selected material. Clean appearance. Low moist. (1.0-2.0m): Brown/grey silty claim. Medium hard texture. Homogeneous consistency. Low moist. High plasticity. No odor\".\n\nMono CPF Field Form, Phase 2 (**Exh. E-476**).\n\nEcuador only provided some comments on the presence of a \"thick sand aquifer\" at Coca CPF, but did not otherwise provide evidence on the clay content at this or any other site. R-PSVB, \u00b6 175.\n\n863.\n\nAccordingly, and subject to the following, the Tribunal will review the groundwater sampling results for Coca 2, Coca CPF, Payamino 4, Payamino 13, Payamino 14/20/24, Payamino 15 and Gacela 1/8.\n\n**6.3.4 Filtration**\n--------------------\n\n864.\n\nThe Parties and their experts defended opposite positions about filtration, although each expert also at times employed practices advocated by the other. For instance, IEMS started filtering the samples from its third campaign onwards, whereas GSI filtered its samples with 5pm filters together with 0.45pm filters during its second campaign (but not 10pm filters as suggested by RPS). At any rate, the Parties agree that INEN Guideline 2169:98 is the relevant source to determine whether filtration is required.1832\n\nINEN Guideline 2169:98 \"Water. Water Quality. Sampling. Handling and Preservation of Samples\" (**Exh. CE-CC-349**). See also: IEMS ER4, Att. 23.\n\n865.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that the experts on both sides concur that 0.45pm filters are appropriate for testing dissolved metals concentrations.1833 GSI and RPS also agree that sediments in suspension should be filtered, although RPS favors using a 10pm filter. They do not agree on whether groundwater sampling should only test for dissolved metals, as argued by GSI, or whether it should also test for colloids or \"total\" metal concentrations, as IEMS purported to do. According to RPS, a 10pm filter would allow testing for colloids as well, which is important, because colloids may still carry metals that might dissolve into the groundwater.1834\n\nGSI ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 121-122; IEMS ER4, p. 75; RPS ER2, pp. 23-24. The Tribunal notes, however, that RPS stressed that TULAS Table 5 requires that samples for arsenic, cyanide and mercury should be \"total\" analyses, not \"dissolved\" analyses.\n\nRPS ER2, p. 23.\n\n866.\n\nThe experts thus essentially disagree on whether metals should be tested for their \"total\" or \"dissolved\" values. A 0.45pm filter would filter all sediments and colloids, leaving only the metals dissolved in the groundwater. According to GSI, filtration with a 0.45pm filter is essential, since the acidification of the sample dissolves the metals attached to the sediment and/or colloids and therefore artificially increases the metals concentration in the sampled water.\n\n867.\n\nAs was seen above, filtration is addressed in TULAS and INEN Guideline 2169:98. Section 5 of Annex 1 of TULAS states that INEN Guideline 2169:98 and INEN Guideline 2187:98 \"must be considered\" to determine the values and concentrations of groundwater samples. Table 5 of TULAS sets the criteria for groundwater remediation in soils with clay content below 25% and requires the measurement of total concentrations for arsenic, cyanide and mercury. By contrast, with respect to chromium, the Tribunal agrees with GSI that Table 5 specifies total chromium since chromium has two valence species, i.e. Cr(+3) and Cr(+6), thus calling for the analysis of the \"full chromium mass, without speciation\".1835 Article 4.5.1 of INEN Guideline 2169:98 provides that \"suspended matters, sediments, algae and other microorganisms *should be removed* when taking the sample or immediately afterwards, by filtration through filter paper, filtration membrane or by centrifugation\".1836 It follows from these provisions that filtration is the regular methodology in groundwater sampling and that TULAS requires the analysis of dissolved (not total) metals concentrations, with the exception of arsenic, cyanide and mercury.\n\nGSI ER2, \u00b6 124. However, the Tribunal disagrees that such is the case for arsenic, cyanide and mercury, although GSI has not made specific arguments with respect to these compounds.\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal. IEMS-RCM 23 (EN) 0006; INEN Guideline 2169:98 \"Water. Water Quality. Sampling. Handling and Preservation of Samples\", p. 0026 (**Exh. CE-CC-349**).\n\n868.\n\nArticle 4.5.1 further specifies that there should be no filtration where the filter is capable of \"retaining one or more of the components that will be analyzed\". Since RPS agrees that a 0.45pm filter is appropriate for dissolved metals analyses, it appears that the filters employed by GSI do not fall into the prohibited category, save for arsenic, cyanide and mercury. The Tribunal thus agrees with RPS that TULAS Table 5 indicates that \"total analyses\" are to be carried out for arsenic, cyanide and mercury.\n\n869.\n\nTable 1 of INEN Guideline 2169:98 outlines the general techniques for sample conservation. The methodology specified for barium, cadmium, total chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc is cross-referenced to the methodology for aluminum. For aluminum, Table 1 distinguishes between (i) analysis for dissolved aluminum, for which filtration with a 0.45pm filter is required prior to acidification, and (ii) analysis for total aluminum without filtering the samples. However, it is unclear when analysis for dissolved as opposed to total aluminium is called for.\n\n870.\n\nArticle 4.5.2 provides some more clarity by stating that \"the analysis *can* involve the separation of both soluble and insoluble forms by filtration (for example: of a metal)\". This provision is couched in permissive terms, which suggests that GSI's filtration method was not improper.\n\n871.\n\nRPS concedes that INEN 2169:98 provides that \"dissolved samples include the use of 0.45pm filters prior to acidification\", but specifies that \"total analyses should not be filtered in the field but only acidified\".1837 Since RPS also concedes that under TULAS Table 5 \"total analyses\" are only required for arsenic, cyanide, and mercury, it follows that INEN Guideline 2169:98 does not require \"total analyses\" for barium, cadmium, copper, total chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, or TPH. Accordingly, GSI's use of 0.45pm filters appears appropriate, especially because the regulations provide no basis for the use of a 10pm filter as advocated by RPS.\n\nRPS ER2, p. 23.\n\n872.\n\nThe experts seem to agree that filtration \u2013 independently of filter size \u2013 is necessary where turbidity exceeds 10 NTU. IEMS even appears to agree that samples must be stabilized to a turbidity of 5 NTU.1838 As noted above, IEMS did not measure the turbidity during its first two sampling campaigns, and its field forms for the third sampling campaign are not of much assistance, since they either do not address NTU or provide a zero value which cannot reflect reality throughout the sampling process (even with low-flow).1839 Moreover, IEMS's fourth campaign shows that unfiltered samples typically have higher turbidity with levels frequently above 15 NTU.1840 Finally, IEMS's observations with respect to turbidity appear to be unreliable, since (i) IEMS's own field notes show that the samples had turbid water (for instance, \"turbid water, brown, with presence of solids\"),1841 (ii) GSI demonstrated that water with 200 NTU is still relatively clear,1842 and (iii) GSI field forms shows significant levels of NTU variations during the sampling process.1843\n\nIEMS ER3, Annex A.10, p. 3, paragraph 6; IEMS-SCM Anexo A.10 (SP) 0004.\n\nIEMS Field Notes (**Exh. E-483**).\n\nSee, for instance: GSI-ROC App F 0081, Table F.4.3 (IEMS Field Observations from Dec. 2012 and Jan. 2013 Study of Filtered vs. Unfiltered Samples).\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. See, for instance: GSI ER2, App. F.4.1; GSI-ROC App F 0091-0092.\n\nGSI-ROC App. F 0078, Figure F.4.3.\n\nField Notes, Forms, Maps and Checklists of GSI Environmental \u2013 First Campaign (produced by Burlington on 14 November 2012) (**Exh. E-475**) ; Field Notes, Forms, Maps and Checklists of GSI Environmental \u2013 Second Campaign (produced by Burlington on 14 November 2012) (**Exh. E-476**).\n\n873.\n\nAccordingly, since IEMS did not filter its samples during its third sampling campaign, the Tribunal cannot rely on these results either as they relate to the metals for which the dissolved concentration was supposed to be analyzed. Indeed, IEMS should at least have used a filter to remove the sediments as RPS conceded and as required under Article 4.5.1 of the INEN Guideline 2169:98.\n\n874.\n\nDuring its fourth field trip, IEMS apparently used both 0.45 pm and 5pm filters to compare the results with unfiltered samples. However, that campaign was limited to Payamino 2/8, Payamino 14/20/24, and Payamino 15. As stated earlier, the Tribunal considers that groundwater testing was unwarranted at Payamino 2/8 because of the elevated clay content at that site. The Tribunal therefore reviewed the results for Payamino 14/20/24 and Payamino 15. The filtered samples show barium and lead exceedances at these sites.1844 Sample 7-PAY-14.20.24-TE-100MW-F at Payamino 14/20/24 has a barium level of 1.07 mg/l in excess of the 0,338 mg/l limit, and a lead level of 0.06 mg/l in excess of the 0,045 mg/l limit. With respect to Payamino 15, sample 7-PAY-15-TE-100MW-F has a barium level of 0.93 mg/l and a lead level of 0.06 mg/l; and sample 7-PAY-15-TE-101MW-F has a barium level of 0.87 mg/l.\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 31.2.2; IEMS-RCM 31.2.2 (EN) 0001.\n\n875.\n\nThe unfiltered samples also show mercury exceedances at these two locations.1845 The issue still arises whether, under Article 4.5.1 of INEN Guideline 2169:98, filtration of sediments is still required, so that only colloids are kept for the \"total analyses\". Since RPS concedes that sediments should be filtered,1846 the Tribunal relies on IEMS's filtered samples, which only show mercury exceedances at Payamino 15.1847\n\nIEMS ER4, Att. 31.2.1; IEMS-RCM 31.2.1 (EN) 0001.\n\nRPS ER2, pp. 23-24.\n\nSample 7-PAY-15-TE-100MW-F has a mercury level of 1.16 mg/l and sample 7-PAY-15-TE-101MW-F has a mercury level of 0.64 mg/l. See: IEMS ER4, Att. 31.2.2; IEMS-RCM 31.2.2 (EN) 0001.\n\n876.\n\nThe Tribunal also reviewed GSI's sampling data, which reveals that remediation is required for TPH at Coca CPF.1848 At that site, the Tribunal identified a TPH exceedance at sampling locations COCPF-GW1 and COCPF-GW1Dup, which have been tested by GSI for gasoline, diesel and oil range organics. The addition of the three values provides the TPH value. COCPF-GW1 thus has a TPH value of 0.53 mg/l and COCPF-GW1Dup has a TPH value of 0.67 mg/l, both in exceedance of the 0,325 mg/l limit under TULAS Table 5.\n\nGSI ER1, App. D, Table D.13.\n\n877.\n\nThe data also shows a nickel exceedance at Payamino 14/20/24 at sampling locations PAY14-GW1 and PAY14-GW1Dup, with a value of 0.05 mg/l exceeding the limit of 0,045 mg/l.\n\n878.\n\nFor the three locations where exceedances are established, there are no elements in the record that would allow to rebut the presumption of causation that arises from the findings of harm. Therefore, Burlington is liable to remediate these exceedances.\n\n879.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that groundwater remediation is required (i) for nickel, barium and lead at Payamino 14/20/24, (ii) for barium, lead and mercury at Payamino 15, and (iii) for TPH at Coca CPF.\n\n**6.3.5 Remediation costs**\n---------------------------\n\n880.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties' arguments with respect to remediation, the Tribunal finds that *in situ* remediation applying permeable reactive interceptor trenches is the most appropriate method in the present circumstances since it filters compounds out of the groundwater over several years. It therefore accepts IEMS's estimated capital cost (based on US price comparisons) of USD 1,680,000 for each contaminated site, which includes USD 350,000 for research and feasibility costs, USD 730,000 capital cost, and USD 600,000 for operation and maintenance for a period of six years.1849 The Tribunal notes that Burlington has not provided alternative cost figures. The total cost of remediation of the three sites identified above thus amounts to **USD 5,040,000**. Since it is Ecuador's burden to prove the existence of groundwater contamination, the Tribunal rejects Ecuador's further request that Burlington pay the cost to complete groundwater studies in 52 other sites in the Blocks.1850\n\nIEMS ER3, pp. 180-181 and Table IV-14.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 423.\n\n**7. Well site abandonment**\n----------------------------\n\n**7.1 Parties' positions**\n--------------------------\n\n881.\n\nFinally, relying both on the Block 7 PSC as well as on Articles 53 RAOHE and 24 ROH (*Reglamento de Operaciones Hidrocarbur\u00edferas*),1851 Ecuador requests that Burlington pay the costs of abandonment of the wells in Block 7. It estimates the costs per site to be at least USD 500,000 and claims a total of USD 3,500,000 for the seven sites contemplated in the Consortium's Abandonment Plan of 2008.1852 Although the Consortium's Abandonment Plan was approved by the authorities in March 2009, Ecuador argues that the budgeted costs of USD 929,772 \"is extremely low\", since IEMS estimated the costs for concrete sealing of a well only at USD 500,000.1853 Therefore, if the Tribunal were minded to consider only the seven sites mentioned in the Abandonment Plan, it should grant at least USD 3,500,000.1854 In addition, Ecuador complains \u2013 though without making a specific claim \u2013 that \"there are other areas that should have been abandoned that were not part of the Abandonment Plan\".1855\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 321; Reglamento Ambiental para las Operaciones Hidrocarbur\u00edferas en el Ecuador, published in the Official Register No. 265 on 13 February 2001 (**Exh.

Article 53 RAOHE provides that, in case of definitive abandonment of an area of influence, the operator must remove all equipment and infrastructure, process all wastes, seal the wells, and restore the site by reforesting the area.1858\n\nArticle 53 of RAOHE (**Exh. EL-174**). See also: 2nd SMCC, \u00b6 322.\n\n884.\n\nThe Consortium submitted an Abandonment Plan to the Ecuadorian authorities in December 2008,1859 which was approved on 20 March 2009 by the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection.1860 That plan covered the seven sites enumerated above (paragraph 882).\n\nPlan de Abandono Definitivo y Entrega de \u00c1reas Utilizadas para la Perforaci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n de Petr\u00f3leo del Bloque 7 aplicable a siete locaciones: Gacela 2, Gacela 3, Lobo 4, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 8 (subsuelo \u00fanicamente), Jaguar 9, C\u00f3ndor Norte (**Exh.

As a result, the Tribunal will not further entertain this complaint.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 326.\n\n886.\n\nBy the time the Consortium left the Blocks in July 2009, no action had been taken towards the abandonment of these seven sites.1862 Thus, Burlington must bear the costs involved in abandoning these seven sites, which it does not dispute. The question to be resolved by the Tribunal is merely one of quantum. Burlington accepts liability for USD 100,000 per site and Ecuador claims at least USD 500,000.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 325; Informe T\u00e9cnico No. 897-AADNPCA-SCA-MA-2009, 21 August 2009 (**Exh. E-172**).\n\n887.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection approved the budgeted abandonment costs of USD 929,772 for the seven sites.1863 IEMS, for its part, stated that it \"did not have sufficient information to calculate the cost of full restoration\". It added that the abandonment costs \"should be calculated by a third party, through an assessment of market characteristics\", since the Consortium's estimate of USD 929,722 was \"extremely low\".1864\n\nLetter of 20 March 2009 from DINAPA to the Consortium (**Exh. E-291**). The Consortium budgeted USD 159,340 for Gacela 2, USD 93,650 for Gacela 3, USD 148,670 for Lobo 4, USD 154,084 for Jaguar 2, USD 99,250 for Jaguar 8, USD 183,400 for Jaguar 9, and USD 91,378 for C\u00f3ndor Norte. See: Plan de Abandono Definitivo y Entrega de \u00c1reas Utilizadas para la Perforaci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n de Petr\u00f3leo del Bloque 7 aplicable a siete locaciones: Gacela 2, Gacela 3, Lobo 4, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 8 (subsuelo \u00fanicamente), Jaguar 9, C\u00f3ndor Norte, pp. 411,4-14, 4-17, 4-20, 4-21,4-25 and 4-28 (**Exh. E-256**).\n\nIEMS ER3, p. 167.\n\n888.\n\nIEMS also refers to an assessment it performed in 2008, which estimated at USD 500,000 the costs to cap one well operated by the City Oriente petroleum company, adding that this did not cover \"soil reconfiguration, dismantlement of infrastructure and cleanup and reforestation\".1865 The Tribunal is unable to rely on this cost figure, as IEMS did not provide any details in respect of City Oriente's services. It also notes that IEMS itself acknowledges that it lacked sufficient information to compute restoration costs. By contrast, the Tribunal has available the costs budgeted by the Consortium and approved by the Ecuadorian authorities which did state that the proposed abandonment plan contemplated \"*las medidas necesarias para asegurar la recuperaci\u00f3n de las condiciones ambientales del sitio*\" or in English, \"the measures required to ensure the restoration of the environmental conditions of the site\".1866 These costs amount in total to **USD 929,722**. Accordingly, the Tribunal grants such amount as costs for abandonment of the seven well sites mentioned above.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal.

Infrastructure Counterclaims**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**1.1 Ecuador's position**\n--------------------------\n\n890.\n\nEcuador claims that when the Consortium abandoned Blocks 7 and 21 in July 2009 and Ecuador (through Petroamazonas) took control of the operations, it became apparent that the Consortium had failed to maintain the Blocks' infrastructure in good working condition in accordance with best industry practices, as required by the PSCs. As a consequence, says Ecuador, Burlington failed to return to Ecuador all equipment, tools, machinery and installations in good condition, thus breaching the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\n891.\n\nEcuador argues that, under both the PSCs and Ecuadorian law, the Consortium was under a dual obligation (i) to construct, maintain and replace the infrastructure on Blocks 7 and 21 in accordance with industry standards and (ii) upon contract termination, to return the Blocks to the State in good working condition. According to Ecuador, the Consortium breached both obligations and Burlington is accordingly liable for the remedial costs.1867\n\nR-Ecuador's Counter-Memorial on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 781-785; 2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 356-362.\n\n892.\n\nMore specifically, Ecuador contends that, under the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21, the Consortium was under an obligation to \"use personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, and technology in accordance with the best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbons industry\".1868 Further, the Consortium was required to deliver to the State \"at no cost and in good condition all wells in production at that time, together with all equipment, tools, machinery, installations and other items acquired under the terms of this Contract, and all items must be in good condition except for normal wear\".1869 Article 29 of the Hydrocarbons Law, incorporated by reference in the PSCs, also provides for an obligation to turn over the infrastructure to the State \"in good condition\".1870\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 358, referring to: clause 5.1.7 of the Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**) and clause 5.1.8 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**).\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 360 (emphasis eliminated), referring to: clause 18.6 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**). Ecuador further points to similar provisions in clause 5.1.22 of the Block 7 PSC and in clauses 5.1.21 and 18.6 of the Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 361, referring to: Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law No. 2967 as in effect on 21 May 1999 (**Exh. EL-92**).\n\n893.\n\nEcuador agrees with Burlington that the PSCs and Ecuadorian Law refer to generally accepted standards1871 and practices in the hydrocarbon industry.1872 Burlington's expert Intertek and Ecuador's witness, Mr. Pablo Luna, explain in detail the contents of these standards with respect to building, maintaining and replacing upstream infrastructure in the hydrocarbon industry.1873\n\nThese include those of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), among others.

Mr. Diego Montenegro, another witness of Ecuador, adds that the condition of the infrastructure did not measure up \"to international petroleum industry standards\".1877\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 938.\n\nSol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10 and 14.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 26.\n\nMontenegro WS1, \u00b6 8.\n\n895.\n\nSpecifically, Ecuador contends that the Consortium failed to maintain and revert the infrastructure in good condition because (i) it operated and built sub-standard facilities (platforms and CPFs); (ii) it failed to repair, replace and/or properly maintain fluid lines and pipelines; (iii) it damaged power generators through the use of a cheap and potentially harmful blend of crude oil and diesel (rather than diesel fuel alone) and through the failure to perform timely overhauls; and (iv) it failed to replace obsolete equipment and systems, install appropriate back-up systems, hold a sufficient stock of spare parts and maintain roads.1878 Ecuador's specific arguments are summarized below.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 367.\n\n896.\n\nEcuador dismisses Burlington's arguments regarding the Consortium's alleged successful operation of Blocks 7 and 21 and Petroamazonas' continued operation as mere rhetorical defenses:\n\ni. With respect to Burlington's argument that the Consortium had the economic incentive to maintain and develop production and thus it made \"no economic sense for the Consortium to ignore maintenance\", Ecuador denies that this was the case for Block 7.1879 Ecuador notes that the Block 7 PSC was to expire in 2010, and a proactive maintenance program would only pay off in the long term. According to Ecuador's witnesses, \"the Consortium's maintenance was driven by a \u2018fix it when it breaks' philosophy\".1880\n\nii. Ecuador denies the Consortium's statement that it \"could not have successfully operated for seven years if the construction and the maintenance of its infrastructure were inadequate\".1881 As explained by Messrs. Luna and Sol\u00eds, the fact of producing crude oil does not necessarily mean that the equipment and facilities were in good condition.1882 According to Ecuador, \"[i]t is a fact that Burlington's alleged \u2018successful' operations and production were obtained at the expense of the environment [\u2026] and the safety of its own personnel\", as Mr. Sol\u00eds's testimony confirms.1883\n\niii. While it is true that Petroamazonas has managed to increase production in Block 7, it is not true that this has been achieved by using the very same infrastructure used by the Consortium. According to Ecuador, \"this increase has been made possible by a massive investment in new infrastructure to replace the obsolete and/or worn-out infrastructure left by the Consortium (the cost of which is included in Ecuador's infrastructure claim) as well as new infrastructure strictly devoted to expanding the crude processing capacity in Block 7 (the cost of which is not claimed by Ecuador) as well as a radical change of the underlying philosophy of the maintenance program (from a corrective to a proactive approach to maintenance)\".1884\n\nReply, \u00b6 458, citing: CMCC, \u00b6 147.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 458-459, referring to: Luna WS4, \u00b6 21; Sol\u00eds, WS2, \u00b6 10.\n\nReply, \u00b6 460, citing: CMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 530, 510.\n\nReply, \u00b6 460, referring to: Luna WS4, \u00b6 8; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 19.\n\nReply, \u00b6 461, referring to: Sol\u00eds WS2, Section IV.\n\nReply, \u00b6 463, relying on: Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6 528.\n\n897.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, \"the reality is that the Consortium's alleged comprehensive maintenance \u2018program' was inexistent or flawed and failed to ensure that the infrastructure in Blocks 7 and 21 was maintained and replaced in accordance with international industry standards\".1885 Ecuador alleges in particular that the Consortium (a) did not devote sufficient resources (whether human or material) to ensure a proper maintenance program, and that (b) in any event its maintenance program was either non-existent or dysfunctional.\n\nReply, \u00b6 464.\n\n898.\n\nWith respect to (a), Messrs. Luna and Sol\u00eds have testified that the Consortium had only about 60 employees (including third party contractors) entrusted with maintenance (rather than 200, as Burlington claims), and that these employees worked on 14-day shifts, meaning that only half of them were on the Blocks at any given time.1886 Nor did the Consortium devote sufficient material resources to maintenance, as is demonstrated when one compares Petroamazonas' spending with that of the Consortium, and when one looks at the lack of spare parts for maintenance repairs.1887\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 467, referring to: Luna WS4, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 and Annex 34; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 and Annex 4.\n\nReply, \u00b6 468, referring to: Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 14 and Annex 4.\n\n899.\n\nWith respect to (b), the evidence and especially the testimony of Messrs. Luna and Sol\u00eds demonstrates that \"neither the Consortium's maintenance inspections nor record keeping practices ever met the requirements of international industry standards and practices\", and the Consortium did not carry out sufficient preventive maintenance tasks.1888 In particular, Ecuador alleges that (i) the Consortium's own data show that from 2007 to 2009, 81% of its maintenance activities were corrective;1889 (ii) the Consortium failed to carry out the necessary inspections, and when it did, they did not meet international standards; (iii) similarly, the Consortium's inspection reports did not meet international standards (for instance, by failing to contain recommendations as to maintenance); and (iv) the Consortium failed to carry out the proactive maintenance tasks required by international standards and practices (for instance, by failing to use \"pigs\" to clean pipelines and flow lines before injecting chemicals, to maintain tanks and power oil pumps, and to carry out overhauls for engines used for power generation).1890 Ecuador adds that the Consortium's SAP system could not correct the failures in the Consortium's maintenance policy.1891\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 471.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 472.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 471-479, referring *inter alia* to: Luna WS4, \u00b6\u00b6 24 and 114 and Annexes 30-33; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 68-72.\n\nReply, \u00b6 480, referring to: Luna WS4, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\n900.\n\nFor Ecuador, the Consortium's \"run to failure\" strategy is confirmed *inter alia* by the email of 11 March 2009, in which Mr. D'Argentr\u00e9 instructed the Consortium's maintenance managers to focus only on urgent and indispensable services and put everything else on standby.1892\n\nEmail of March 11, 2009 from Eric D'Argentr\u00e9 to the Consortium\u2018s maintenance managers (**Exh. E-504**) (\"As of today, all orders for min/max (MRP), all services that are not urgent (welding, instrumentation, road maintenance, system, etc.), all RRCC expenses, etc., must be placed on standby\u2026\"; \"We will spend money only on indispensable things to maintain production and to avoid any legal action by the Ecuadorian state\" (Translation by the Tribunal)).\n\n901.\n\nEcuador also denies that the evidence contemporaneous to the Consortium's operatorship demonstrates the good condition of the Blocks' infrastructure. While Ecuador recognizes that \"it is true that these documents include some statements in passing to the effect that most of Block 7 and 21 infrastructure was in good condition\", it argues that \"none of them were intended to constitute a proper basis for assessing the true technical condition of Block 7 and 21 infrastructure at that time\".1893 Ecuador contends in particular that (i) the 2009 SGS Report was \"nothing more than an inventory of the field equipment and facilities for accounting purposes\", and was not a technical inspection that could serve to establish the state of the equipment and facilities;1894 (ii) the 2008 Block 7 environmental audit lasted only one week, which would not have been sufficient to assess the condition of all of the Block's equipment;1895 and (iii) as far as the 2008 Block 21 environmental audit is concerned, while it appears to have required more working hours, its conclusions are limited to assessing the Block's facilities and equipment in light of its environmental impact, and as a result does not provide useful information on their physical condition.1896 In any event, Ecuador argues that environmental audits are of limited value to assess the technical condition of equipment and facilities.1897\n\nReply, \u00b6 484.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 485, referring to: Luna WS4, \u00b6 69 and Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6 85.\n\nReply, \u00b6 486, referring to: Puente WS1, \u00b6 19.\n\nReply, \u00b6 487.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 486, referring to: Luna WS4, \u00b6 71.\n\n902.\n\nSimilarly, Ecuador dismisses the relevance of Dr. Egan's testimony. Ecuador argues in particular that Dr. Egan's factual testimony is of limited value because he only visited the Blocks once in 2012 for a period of one week. Thus, his testimony on the condition of the infrastructure postdates the takeover or relies on the review of documents, which Ecuador characterizes as hearsay. Ecuador further submits that Dr. Egan's expert evidence is unreliable, because \"to assess whether equipment is in \u2018good condition' and whether there has been \u2018normal wear' the actual rates of degradation need to be assessed\", and \"[t]hat assessment can only be done contemporaneously; it cannot be gleaned from by an inspection undertaken three years later in 2012 (which is what Dr. Egan did) and not by reference to generic industry practices (which is what Dr. Egan\u2018s Expert Reports purport to do with respect to all of the key categories of equipment and infrastructure)\". Accordingly, Messrs. Luna and Sol\u00eds's contemporaneous evidence should be preferred.1898\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 942-943 (emphasis eliminated).\n\n903.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, the evidence in the record establishes beyond doubt that many of the Blocks' equipment and facilities were either obsolete or in bad condition exceeding normal wear and tear. Ecuador's specific arguments in this respect are summarized further below.\n\n904.\n\nEcuador quantifies the damages suffered as a result of the Consortium's breaches of its infrastructure obligations for Blocks 7 and 21 at USD 17,231,458.85. It describes this amount as modest, given that it represents \"only 28% of the Consortium's maintenance budget during the operatorship, or a USD 2 million maintenance shortfall for each year of the Consortium's six and a half year operatorship\".1899\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 1007 (footnote omitted).\n\n905.\n\nContrary to Burlington's contention, Ecuador submits that it has duly substantiated all of its claims for infrastructure damage and is not claiming costs related to the expansion of Blocks 7 and 21.1900\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 518-534.\n\n**1.2 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n906.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims should be dismissed along with its environmental claim. The Consortium complied with its obligation to maintain the Blocks' infrastructure in accordance with international engineering standards and in compliance with the PSCs. Indeed, Ecuador has failed to provide credible evidence to the contrary. Burlington describes Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims as concocted and \"alternatively unsubstantiated or irrelevant to refurbishing or replacing substandard equipment\".1901\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 637.\n\n907.\n\nPrior to this arbitration, Ecuador had never alerted the Consortium to any major defect in its maintenance practices or the condition of the Blocks' infrastructure. Even though the expropriation thwarted any prospect of an orderly handover of the Blocks, the condition of the infrastructure as of July 2009 complied with all of the Consortium's contractual and legal obligations.\n\n908.\n\nBurlington draws attention to Clause 5.1.8 of the Block 7 PSC and to Clause 5.1.7 of the Block 21 PSC, under which the Consortium was under an obligation to use the infrastructure \"in accordance with the generally accepted norms and practices of the international petroleum industry\".1902\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 516.\n\n909.\n\nThe Claimant further notes that Ecuador adopted the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards. API is one of several international standard-developing agencies establishing industry consensus on best practices regarding the construction and maintenance of equipment. API standards combine preventive and predictive maintenance techniques. Preventive maintenance techniques refer to \"time-based, planned maintenance activities or scheduled tasks, irrespective of the conditions under which the equipment operates\", whereas predictive maintenance techniques are used \"to tailor maintenance activities to individual pieces of equipment in operation\".1903 By adopting both, as the Consortium did in the present case, operators ensure compliance with best industry practices.1904\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 520-521, referring to: Intertek ER1, \u00b6 27.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 522.\n\n910.\n\nBurlington also stresses that Clauses 18.6 of the Block 7 PSC and 18.6 of the Block 21 PSC provided that the Consortium was to return the equipment in good condition except for normal wear. Article 29 of the 1978 Hydrocarbons Law also refers to \"good condition\". Contrary to what Ecuador implies, good condition does not require the return of new or upgraded equipment. Ecuador wrongly asserts that the infrastructure present in the Blocks shows more than mere normal wear and tear. There is no obligation under the PSCs or Ecuadorian law to replace equipment simply because it is old.\n\n911.\n\nBurlington further claims that Ecuador's notion of \"obsolescence\" is misconstrued. As the Claimant's expert Dr. Egan has explained, Ecuador's concept of obsolescence does not accord with the commonly used definition in the oil industry.1905 As stated in a document on which Ecuador relies, \"the \u2018key is not the age of existing equipment, but its condition'\".1906\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 528; Rejoinder, \u00b6 343.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 343, referring to: Luna WS4, Annex 48, R.L Hughes, *Reasons to Replace Equipment*, 2001, Reliability.com, p. 1.\n\n912.\n\nBurlington affirms that it has complied with international petroleum industry practices. Indeed, had the Consortium not used equipment in compliance with international practices, it would not have been able to operate the fields for over seven years.1907 First, the equipment was built in accordance with international standards. This was confirmed by Moody International, for instance, which inspected the tanks and attested that they had been built in compliance with API 650.1908 It is further confirmed by Dr. Egan and the 2008 Environmental Audit.1909 Second, approximately 200 qualified employees followed a comprehensive maintenance program set up by the Consortium, combining preventive and predictive strategies.1910 Third, the Consortium kept detailed maintenance records and was subject to extensive reporting obligations (yearly budgets, annual reports, quarterly reports).1911\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 530.\n\nD'Argentr\u00e9 WS1, \u00b6 92.\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 107; Block 21 Environmental Audit, November 2008, Table 5-4, pp. 5-26 (**Exh. CE-CC-183**). Burlington mistakenly refers to Exh. E-153.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 532-533.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 534.\n\n913.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant submits that Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims have no legal merit and should be dismissed. Not content with reaping over US$ 4 billion in revenue from the Blocks since their seizure, Ecuador now seeks an additional US$ 17 million \"to upgrade the infrastructure taken from the Consortium\".1912 Considering that they do not amount to more than 1% of the total amount claimed by Ecuador in these proceedings, Burlington argues that the infrastructure counterclaims have been fabricated by Ecuador in order to \"provide foundation to its environmental allegations\",1913 and \"set off against Perenco and Burlington's claims for the loss of their investments in the Blocks\".1914\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 228.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 229.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 638.\n\n914.\n\nBurlington also asserts that the abundant evidence in the record is unequivocal in showing that the Blocks' infrastructure was in good working condition in July 2009. This was expressly confirmed by the two reports drafted by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance conducted in 2009 and 2010 (the \"SGS Reports\").1915 In this respect, Ecuador's \"self-serving inspection reports\" prepared several years after the seizure are irrelevant. Moreover, Ecuador's damages claim includes costs related to its decision to increase production in the Blocks as well as other costs unrelated to this arbitration.1916\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, Inventory Report, 2009 (**Exh. CE-CC-217**) and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, Inventory Report, 2010 (**Exh. CE-CC-240**).\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 231.\n\n915.\n\nContemporaneous assessments of the infrastructure used in Blocks 7 and 21, argues Burlington, contradict Ecuador's thesis of obsolescence and lack of maintenance, as shown by the following reports:\n\ni. The 2008 Environmental Audits of Blocks 7 and 21 refute Ecuador's allegation that the infrastructure was in \"sub-standard conditions\". The Block 7 audit reached the conclusion that \"[i]n general the installations and equipment are in good condition\", identifying only minor issues of normal wear and tear.1917 Similarly, the Block 21 audit concluded that the facilities were \"appropriately maintained and are subject to an ongoing maintenance program\".1918\n\nii. The assessment carried out by SGS shortly before the seizure in July 2009 also refutes Ecuador's claims. All of the equipment on the Blocks was examined at that time, resulting in a 9,000 page report. SGS concluded that approximately 92% of the equipment in Block 7 and 99% of the equipment in Block 21 was in \"good\" to \"very good\" condition.1919 Thus, this report provides no support to Ecuador's exaggerated accusations of disastrous and dangerous conditions.1920\n\niii. The SGS Report commissioned by Ecuador after the seizure once again confirmed the good condition of the infrastructure in both Blocks.1921\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 537; Block 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008 (**Exh. CE-CC-182**), p. 82.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 538; Block 21 Environmental Audit, November 2008, Section 7, p. 1 (**Exh. CE-CC-** **183**), Section 7, p. 1. Burlington mistakenly refers to Exh. E-153.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, Inventory Report, 2009 (**Exh.

(Day 6) (ENG), 2050:4-16 (Direct, D'Argentr\u00e9). See also: C-PHB, \u00b6 246.\n\n917.\n\nAccording to Burlington, the Hearing showed that Ecuador's witnesses lacked credibility or relevant knowledge. Whereas Burlington chose to commission a leading oil and gas infrastructure expert, Dr. Egan, to assess the infrastructure counterclaims, Ecuador decided to rely exclusively on factual witnesses, who lacked credibility and first-hand knowledge of the operations on the Blocks.1923\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 233-239.\n\n918.\n\nBurlington submits that, in any event, Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims are wholly unsubstantiated and in fact comprise a thinly disguised claim for regular maintenance (of the type that Petroamazonas as operator as of July 2009 must bear) and betterment of the Blocks beyond what the Claimant was contractually required to hand over. The Consortium maintained and returned the infrastructure in accordance with the PSCs and Ecuadorian law. Ecuador has failed to provide credible evidence to the contrary and instead has fabricated infrastructure claims that are unsubstantiated or unrelated to the alleged sub-standard condition of the equipment on the Blocks.1924\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 402-423.\n\n**2. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n919.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by setting out the applicable legal framework (2.1) as well as some general considerations applying to all infrastructure counterclaims (2.2). Thereafter, it will discuss each of Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims, i.e. the claims in respect of tanks (2.3), fluid lines and pipelines (2.4), power generators (2.5), pumps, equipment and systems, back-up systems, spare parts and roads (2.6), and other claims (2.7) before reaching a conclusion (2.8).\n\n**2.1 Legal framework**\n-----------------------\n\n920.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that certain clauses of the PSCs establish the Consortium's particular obligations with respect to the Blocks' infrastructure, both *during the operation* of Blocks 7 and 21 and *upon termination* of the PSCs.\n\n921.\n\nClause 5.1.8 of the PSC for Block 7 and Clause 5.1.7 of the PSC for Block 21 require the Consortium to use qualified personnel and suitable equipment and technology during the operation of the Blocks. Clause 5.1.8 reads as follows:\n\n\"5.1 Obligations of the Contractor: [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.1.8 Use qualified personnel, as well as suitable equipment, machinery, materials and technology, in accordance with generally accepted international petroleum industry practices\".\n\n922.\n\nClause 5.1.7 similarly provides:\n\n\"5.1 Contractor's Obligations: [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.1.7 To use personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, and technology in accordance with the best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbon industry\".1925\n\nBlock 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1** ; **Exh. CE-CC-28**) and Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\n923.\n\nUpon termination of the PSCs, Clauses 5.1.22 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 7 and Clauses 5.1.21 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 21 provide that the Consortium shall return the wells and equipment to PetroEcuador in good condition, except for normal wear and tear, and at no cost. Specifically, these provisions are worded as follows:\n\nBlock 7 PSC\n\n\"5.1.22 Upon termination of the Contract, deliver the wells, property, installations, equipment and infrastructure related to this Contract to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, pursuant to the provisions of Article twenty-nine (29) of the Hydrocarbons Law\".\n\n\"18.6 Upon termination of this Contract, either due to expiration of the Production Period or for any other reason during the same Period, the Contractor will deliver to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, all wells in production at that time, together with all equipment, tools, machinery, installations and other items acquired under the terms of this Contract, and all items must be in good condition except for normal wear\".\n\nBlock 21 PSC\n\n\"5.1.21 Upon termination of the Contract, the Contractor shall deliver to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, the wells, property, facilities, and equipment that were acquired for the purpose of the Contract in accordance with article 29 of the Law on Hydrocarbons\".\n\n\"18.6 Upon termination of this present Contract at the end of the Production Period or for any other cause occurring during the same Period, the Contractor shall deliver to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good production conditions, the wells that are active at such time as well as, in good conditions except for normal wear and tear, all other equipment, tools, machinery, facilities, and other movable and immovable property acquired for the purposes of this present Contract\".1926\n\nBlock 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1** ; **CE-CC-28**) and Block 21 PSC (**Exh. C-2** ; **Exh. CE-CC-13**).\n\n924.\n\nThe provisions cited above essentially restate the obligations set out in Article 29 of the Hydrocarbons Law, to which both provisions refer:\n\n\"[U]pon termination of an exploration and exploitation contract, due to expiration of its term or for any other reason arising during the exploitation period, the contractor or associate must turn over to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in a good state of production, the oil wells that are in activity at the time; as well as, in good condition, all equipment, tools, machinery, installations and other real or personal property that were acquired for the purposes of the contract [\u2026]\".1927\n\nHydrocarbons Law, Article 29 (**Exh. EL-92**) (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n925.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these provisions set out two separate but related obligations: the first one is an *obligation de moyens*, which would be met if the Consortium employed generally accepted standards and practices in the petroleum industry in the operation of the Blocks, while the second is an *obligation de r\u00e9sultat*, which would only be met if the Consortium delivered the Blocks in a certain condition at the expiration of the PSCs. Whether the Consortium complied with the first obligation will depend on its standard of diligence, whereas whether it complied with the second will depend on an objective assessment of the state of the infrastructure, regardless of diligence. Ultimately, however, the amount of any compensation is to be determined on the basis of damage actually caused.\n\n926.\n\nWith respect to the first obligation, the *obligation de moyens*, the Parties agree that the \"best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbon industry\" referred to in the clauses quoted above include in particular the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards, which are endorsed by Ecuadorian legislation.1928 For example, Article 10 of the ROH provides that contractors \"shall apply, at least\" the API standard \"and any other rule or standard of the petroleum industry\":\n\n\"**Norms and standards** : In hydrocarbon operations, PETROECUADOR and contractors shall apply, at least, the practices recommended by the American Petroleum Institute (API) particularly the following: \u2018Exploration and Production Standards' and the \u2018Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards' and any other rule or standard of the petroleum industry\".1929\n\nSee www.api.org and Catalog of the American Petroleum's Institute's 2010 Publications Programs and Services (**Exh. E-299**).\n\nROH, Article 10 (**Exh. EL-181**) (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n927.\n\nIn addition, the RAOHE sets specific standards related to infrastructure and contains several references to the API standards.1930 It is similarly undisputed that the API standards combine preventive and predictive maintenance techniques.\n\nRAOHE, Articles 25, 71 and 72 (**Exh. EL-174**).\n\n928.\n\nWith respect to the second *obligation de r\u00e9sultat*, Burlington's obligation was to return the equipment in good (working) condition, except for normal wear and tear. For Ecuador, this obligation is informed by the Consortium's obligation to comply with best standards and practices, as follows:\n\n\"[T]he content of the Consortium\u2018s positive hand-back obligation is plainly informed by the Consortium\u2018s ongoing obligation to operate the equipment to \"*best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbon industry*\". Accordingly, for the reasons explained by Dr. Egan under cross-examination: (i) \"*Good condition*\" means that the equipment and infrastructure has both been maintained in accordance with best international practice *and* is performing in accordance with its expected industry standard performance levels for equipment and infrastructure of that type and age; and (ii) \"*Normal wear*\" means that the equipment is only degrading at the industry-expected rate for equipment that has been maintained in accordance with best international practice (assessing actual rates of degradation, not merely maintenance in accordance with manufacturer maintenance intervals, is the relevant enquiry). \"*Good condition*\" does not simply mean \"*no problems*\" at the moment of termination\".1931\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 936 (emphasis in the original).\n\n929.\n\nEcuador also submits that, according to the best standards and practices in the international hydrocarbon industry, upstream infrastructure must be replaced when (a) it has become obsolete, or (b) it is no longer fit for service. The Parties appear to agree that equipment that is no longer fit for service must be replaced, but differ in their definition of obsolescence:\n\ni. Burlington, relying on Dr. Egan, submits that \"properly-functioning equipment that can be serviced is not considered obsolete in the upstream oil industry. Instead, oil field equipment becomes obsolete when it no longer operates and can no longer be maintained because (i) the manufacturer is no longer in business, (ii) spare parts are no longer available, or (iii) service providers for maintenance are no longer available\".1932 Dr. Egan does not cite to petroleum standards, but to an article commenting on obsolescence in air force equipment.1933\n\nii. Ecuador, relying on Mr. Luna, contends that \"obsolescence is a rule of efficiency which considers both the technology of the equipment as well as the availability of parts, the cost of maintenance (which is based on the quality of the maintenance), whether the useful life [of the asset] has ended [...] Operational safety should be included in the concept of obsolescence\".1934 Ecuador thus finds Dr. Egan's criteria too restrictive \"and even absurd as they imply that equipment is not obsolete (and accordingly, need not be replaced as long as it does not fail) even though a newer and more efficient technology has become available and / or the equipment is no longer safe to operate\".1935\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6 25. See also: Intertek ER1, \u00b6 131.\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 130, citing to: JB Bissell, Obsolete Obsolescence, 2 March 2012 (**Exh. CE-CC-262**).\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6\u00b6 57,61, citing to: R. L. Hughes, Reasons to Replace Equipment, 2001, www.Reliability.com (Luna WS4, Annex 48).\n\nReply, \u00b6 453(a).\n\n930.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Dr. Egan nor Mr. Luna have cited to standards in the hydrocarbon industry to make these assertions. It has thus considered each position in the context of Burlington's contractual obligation, which was to return equipment in good (working) condition, except for normal wear, without requiring Burlington to upgrade it to the newest and most efficient technology. It thus finds that Burlington had to replace equipment when it was no longer fit for service, when it could no longer be operated or be maintained, when it had exceeded its useful life, or (even if the above conditions were not met), when it posed an operational safety risk.1936\n\nThe Tribunal has noted in particular the article cited by Mr. Luna at Annex 48: R. L. Hughes, Reasons to Replace Equipment, 2001, www.Reliability.com (\"So how do we know when equipment has actually reached, or is approaching, the end of its useful life cycle. [\u2026] First and foremost is safety. [\u2026] When the equipment presents an unacceptable safety risk to the plant, plant personnel or the environment \u2013 replace it!\").\n\n931.\n\nWith these standards in mind, the Tribunal will now turn to Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims.\n\n**2.2 General considerations on the assessment of the infrastructure counterclaims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n932.\n\nPrior to analyzing each of the infrastructure counterclaims below, the Tribunal wishes to mention three points.\n\n933.\n\nFirst, both Parties challenge the credibility or relevance of each other's witnesses and experts. The Tribunal recognizes that the witness and expert testimony submitted by both Parties has some limitations. With respect to witness evidence, the Tribunal notes in particular that only one of Ecuador's witnesses (Mr. Sol\u00eds) was present in the Blocks during the Consortium's operatorship, and Burlington has challenged his credibility.1937 Similarly, Ecuador challenges the relevance of Mr. D'Argentr\u00e9's testimony, because he was only present in the Blocks from 2007 on. With respect to expert evidence, Ecuador challenges the testimony of Dr. Egan. It argues that, because he only visited the fields in 2012, he cannot attest to the state of the infrastructure in 2009 as a factual matter, nor can he provide an expert opinion on the degradation of the infrastructure on that date. The Tribunal agrees that Dr. Egan is not a factual witness, but it sees no reason to dismiss outright Dr. Egan's expert opinions based on his review of contemporaneous documents.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 234-235.\n\n934.\n\nAs a result, to the extent possible, the Tribunal will primarily rely on contemporaneous documents to determine the state of the infrastructure on the date of the takeover. If it nevertheless relies on witness evidence, the Tribunal will take into consideration the actual knowledge of the particular witness. Similarly, if it relies on expert evidence, the Tribunal will consider whether such evidence is based on an objective assessment of contemporaneous documents in light of the applicable industry standards and practices.\n\n935.\n\nSecond, there are two contemporaneous reports in the record prepared by an independent third party, SGS, in 2009 and 2010 (the \"SGS Reports\").1938 Both documents assess the condition of the infrastructure (including equipment, facilities and other assets) of Blocks 7 and 21 according to five categories: very good, good, fair, bad, and very bad.1939 According to those reports, a significant majority of the infrastructure was considered to be in a good or very good condition. Indeed, this seems confirmed by some of Ecuador's claims, such as those related to tanks and pumps: the Respondent seeks compensation for what it claims was the sub-standard condition of only 3 tanks out of the 89 present on the Blocks, and of only 5 pumps out of the 160 on the Blocks. It is true that Ecuador dismisses the SGS Reports on the grounds that they are mere asset inventories.1940 The Claimant's expert Dr. Egan, for his part, considers these reports \"very important\" \"as a starting point\", but acknowledges that they are not the equivalent of a technical audit of the condition of the equipment.1941\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, Inventory Report, 2009 (**Exh.

CE-CC-240**).\n\nThe excel sheets in Exhibits CE-CC-240 and CE-CC-217 show columns with headings \"MB\", i.e. \"*muy bueno*\", \"B\", i.e. \"*bueno*\", \"R\", i.e. \"*regular*\", \"M\", i.e. \"*malo*\" and \"D\", i.e. \"*deficiente*\".\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 980-983; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.\n\nTr.

Here again, Ecuador seeks to diminish the importance of this fact. It in particular stresses that none of the amounts claimed is associated with the expansion of production in the Blocks.1943 The amounts claimed \u2013 approximately USD 17 million \u2013 confirms this, says the Respondent, when one compares this figure with Petroamazonas's average annual maintenance costs of USD 25 million.1944\n\nInforme de auditor\u00eda con un prop\u00f3sito especial a las inversiones, costos y gastos del Bloque 7 (incluye Campo Coca-Payamino), Administraci\u00f3n Temporal Petroamazonas S.A.

Montenegro and Luna, in particular: Montenegro WS3, \u00b6 19; Luna WS4, \u00b6 32.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 993.\n\n938.\n\nAs a general matter, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt Ecuador's statement that the amounts claimed here are unrelated to the expansion of the activities in Blocks 7 and 21. It remains though that the evidence of Petroamazonas's expansion activities make it sometimes difficult to establish the facts as they stood when Burlington left the Blocks. The Tribunal will keep this in mind when assessing the evidence and will now review each type of claim individually.\n\n**2.3 Claims related to tanks**\n-------------------------------\n\n**2.3.1 Ecuador's position**\n----------------------------\n\n939.\n\nEcuador argues that the Consortium operated and built sub-standard facilities (referring mostly to platforms and CPFs). It continued to use facilities that had been built \"more than 15 years\" ago without replacing them.1945 It even built new facilities \"using old pumps and tanks recycled from older facilities that were dismantled for this purpose\",1946 including pieces of equipment that were \"too old\"1947 to be recycled.\n\nSol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6 11.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 371.\n\n*Ibid*., citing: Sol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6 13.\n\n940.\n\nEcuador submits that the storage tanks are a salient example of how the Consortium used and built facilities that did not comply with industry standards.1948 First, Ecuador contends that the Consortium purchased sub-standard tanks to avoid the costs of more expensive tanks from established suppliers. In addition, Ecuador emphasizes that the Consortium did not build a single tank in Block 7 with new materials. While recycling parts of old tanks is not prohibited, it must comply with strict requirements that were not met in this case. As a consequence, these tanks posed a safety and environmental risk. As for Block 21, the tanks were bought at a discount from an inexperienced company, and it is thus not surprising that they were sub-standard.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 368-376.\n\n941.\n\nSecond, the Consortium failed to properly maintain these tanks. Inspections carried out from 2010 onwards show that several tanks in Blocks 7 and 21 were in need of repair given their bad condition, which exceeded normal wear and tear. These tanks posed significant safety and environmental risks. A 5,000 barrel storage tank in the Oso CPF, for instance, \"only allowed for a 30-minute reaction time from pump failure before a spill\".1949 The Consortium also wrongly sought to minimize the seriousness of the situation in its 2008 Environmental Audit.1950\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 373.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 377.\n\n942.\n\nEcuador specifies that the following tanks were in bad condition beyond normal wear and tear as follows:\n\ni. The Yuralpa CPF T-400 tank. According to Ecuador, the bad condition of this tank was reported in two inspections in 2010 and 2011. The 2011 inspection reported that 71% of the tank's internal coating had deteriorated and recommended exhaustive repair of the tank's interior, which was done by a third party.1951\n\nii. The Gacela CPF T-101 (T-72130A), T-102 (T-72130B) and T-104 (now T-72400) tanks. According to Ecuador, various inspections between 2010 and 2012 detected serious corrosion at levels exceeding normal wear and tear, and recommended full repair of tank T-104, which was done in 2012. The inspection reports for tanks T-101 and T-102 also indicated that parts of these tanks were worn out beyond normal wear and tear and had to be replaced.1952 According to Ecuador, this shows that the Consortium's maintenance was insufficient.\n\niii. The Coca CPF T-101 (T-71130), T-102 (T-71400A) and T-106 (T-71400B) tanks. Ecuador alleges that inspections carried out in 2011 and 2012 identified corrosion levels exceeding normal wear and tear on the shells and roof, as well as leaking joints and cracked basins.1953 According to Ecuador, this shows that the repairs carried out by the Consortium in T-101 and T-102 were insufficient.1954\n\niv. The Payamino CPF T-101 (T-70130), T-102 (T-70100) and T-105 (T-70400) tanks. Ecuador notes that inspections carried out between 2010 and 2011 identified issues of abnormal wear and tear, including the fact that four rings and the roof of the T-101 tank should have been replaced before July 2009 (at the then corrosion rate).1955\n\nReply, \u00b6 493(a); Luna WS4, Annexes 45, 52 and 53.\n\nReply, \u00b6 493(b); Luna WS4, Annexes 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60.\n\nReply, \u00b6 493(c); Luna WS4, Annexes 27, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.\n\nReply, \u00b6 493(c); Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\nReply, \u00b6 493(d); Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6 49; Luna WS4, \u00b6 93 and Annex 68.\n\n943.\n\nOut of those tanks, Ecuador claims the amounts spent to repair Gacela T-104, Payamino T-102 and Yuralpa T-400, for a total of USD 902,962.1956\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 515 and 523; Montenegro WS1, \u00b6 23; Montenegro WS3, \u00b6 17 and Annexes 3-5; Luna WS4, \u00b6 160 and Annexes 54 and 90.\n\n**2.3.2 Burlington's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n944.\n\nBy contrast, Burlington contends that the Consortium had a suitable tank maintenance program which included cathodic protection and frequent inspections to check for external corrosion, dents and leaks.1957\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 547.\n\n945.\n\nBurlington also notes that Ecuador's claim relates to a mere three tanks out of the 89 tanks on the Blocks. The small percentage of tanks that are the subject of this claim (3.3%) shows that the vast majority of the tanks were in good working condition at the time when Ecuador took over the Blocks and is proof that the Consortium's comprehensive tank maintenance and repair program was effective.1958\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 381.\n\n946.\n\nFurthermore, Burlington argues that the Block 7 tanks which, according to Ecuador, needed to be replaced or repaired, underwent comprehensive repairs between 2005 and 2008 or were taken out of service with governmental approval.1959 In respect of the Block 21 tanks, they were built in accordance with industry standards and adequately maintained with a cathodic protection process.1960 In particular, Burlington asserts that the reported degradation and corrosion in the three tanks on which Ecuador bases its claim occurred under Petroamazonas's watch, well after the Consortium left the Blocks.1961 As a consequence, concludes Burlington, Ecuador's tank claims are groundless and should be rejected.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 548-553.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 554-556.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 264.\n\n**2.3.3 Discussion**\n--------------------\n\n947.\n\nEcuador takes issue with the Consortium's practices for the building and maintenance of storage tanks. It also asserts that 10 tanks out of 89 were in a bad condition beyond normal wear and tear when Ecuador took over the Blocks, but limits its damages claim to the cost of repairing three tanks.\n\n948.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Ecuador has not substantiated its claim that the Consortium failed to construct or maintain tanks in accordance with industry standards and practices.\n\n949.\n\nFirst, Dr. Egan has confirmed that, in his expert opinion, these tanks were constructed and maintained in accordance with industry standards. Dr. Egan notes (and Mr. Luna does not disagree) that oil storage tanks are built in accordance with API 650, while their maintenance is governed by API 653 and bolted storage tanks for oil processing are governed by API 12B.1962 After reviewing a selection of the tanks in the Blocks (between 15 to 20) during his visit in 2012, as well as maintenance records, Dr. Egan confirmed that the Consortium abided by these standards. Specifically:\n\ni. With respect to construction, Dr. Egan confirmed that all of the tanks which he examined had the manufacturers' name plates attached, indicating that the tanks were manufactured in accordance with API 650.1963\n\nii. With respect to maintenance, Dr. Egan confirmed that \"the Consortium (1) regularly inspected the tanks and kept records of observations made during those inspections; (2) monitored the corrosion of the tanks according to API 653; (3) implemented an effective cathodic protection program; (4) worked with independent contractors to conduct periodically comprehensive assessments in order to identify necessary repairs; (5) devised plans to repair the large tanks on the Blocks; (6) kept Ecuador apprised of tank repair plans; and (7) implemented these plans\".1964 Dr. Egan then concluded that \"[i]n light of the Consortium's diligence in inspecting the tanks, the corrosion control and monitoring, the thorough assessments, and the creation and implantation of tank repair plans, I believe the Consortium was a responsible operator and complied with best industry practices\".1965 To support this conclusion, Dr. Egan cited numerous inspection reports and maintenance records.1966\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 105.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 107.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 110.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 123.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 110-123, referring to: Exhs. CE-CC-164; CE-CC-188; CE-CC-212; CE-CC-075; CE-CC-211; CE-CC-005; CE-CC-170; CE-CC-160; CE-CC-086; CE-CC-092; CE-CC-181; CE-CC-087; CE-CC-148.\n\n950.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Dr. Egan's physical inspection was limited to 15 to 20 tanks out of 89, and that Mr. Luna has objected to his assessment of the Consortium's inspection records. However, the fact that Ecuador has limited its comments to 10 out of 89 tanks (i.e., 11%), and claims damages with respect to only 3 of them (3%), suggests that the Consortium's maintenance plan was generally adequate, and that problems were the exception.\n\n951.\n\nSecond, as Dr. Egan has pointed out, the inspections carried out by Petroamazonas took place between 2010 and 2012, i.e. between one to three years after the takeover of the Blocks, and the type of corrosion identified by Petroamazonas in the tanks is one that normally occurs quickly. As a result, inspections carried out one year later or thereafter would not be able to demonstrate whether the alleged corrosion was caused by the Consortium. Dr. Egan explains this as follows:\n\n\"Ecuador is relying on \u2018tank inspections' conducted \u2018from 2010 onwards' to demonstrate that a certain degree of corrosion plagued the tanks in July 2009. This is a risky approach because corrosion can develop and propagate rapidly due to internal vapors of the liquid contained in the tank. As Mr. Luna discusses in his third witness statement, there are two types of corrosion: \u2018homogenous' corrosion, which impacts equipment uniformly, and \u2018localized' corrosion, which appears in the form of \u2018pitting' (holes) and fissures. While homogenous corrosion results in normal wear and can be more easily addressed and repaired, localized corrosion \u2018is insidious and often results in failure or even total destruction of equipment without warning'.\n\n\u2018Localized' corrosion can occur very quickly and is often unanticipated. This type of corrosion generally occurs from the inside of tanks, as tanks of stored fluids contain a fair amount of oxygen, carbon dioxide and acids, which form a corrosive substance. As acid condenses on the roof of the tank, it gains greater concentration when evaporation occurs and can become extremely corrosive (as seems to have occurred in the Gacela T-104 tank, for example).\n\nIt is therefore incorrect to assume, as Mr. Luna does, that corrosion condition at one point in time accurately reflect the condition a year or more earlier\".1967\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 79-81, citing: Luna WS4, \u00b6 65.\n\n952.\n\nOn this basis, Dr. Egan concludes that \"[n]one of the inspection reports submitted by Ecuador, some of which were conducted two and a half years after Ecuador took over the Blocks, suggests that the current damage to the tanks was caused by the Consortium's operations. Rather, it appears that the tanks have fallen into much worse condition since Petroamazonas took control of the Blocks\".1968\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6 82.\n\n953.\n\nHaving considered both Mr. Luna's and Dr. Egan's testimony as well as the documents in the record, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Ecuador has not established that the Consortium breached its obligation to construct and maintain tanks according to industry standards.\n\n954.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to Ecuador's claim that the Consortium returned certain tanks evidencing deterioration beyond normal wear and tear. As Ecuador claims damages for only three specific tanks, the Tribunal will focus its analysis on these items.\n\n**a. Gacela T-104 tank**\n------------------------\n\n955.\n\nThe record shows that the Gacela T-104 tank was inspected in December 2010, December 2011 and February 2012.1969 The December 2010 inspection detected problems with the tank roof, which had a hole and presented high level of oxidization.1970 The December 2011 inspection reported that \"the damages caused by the corrosive processes have increased in a significant manner since the records held for the month of March\" and called for a complete change of the roof, among other measures.1971 The February 2012 inspection concluded that the tank roof and bottom had to be replaced and a cathodic protection system needed to be put in place.1972 The SGS Reports are of no assistance in this context as they make no mention of this tank.\n\nLuna WS4, Annexes 55 to 57.\n\n*Id*., Annex 55, p.1.\n\n*Id*., Annex 56, pp. 6-7 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n*Id*., Annex 57, p. 12.\n\n956.\n\nDr. Egan agrees that the pictures taken during these inspections \"clearly demonstrate significant levels of corrosion\", but opines that \"Ecuador fails to explain how the pitting corrosion located on the Gacela T-104 tank at the time of the inspections is attributable to the Consortium\".1973 According to Dr. Egan, the fact that the tank was in good condition when it was inspected in December 2008 and April 2009 suggests that it was also in good condition in July 2009.\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6 87.\n\n957.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Dr. Egan's explanations. The corrosion of the tank roof reported in 2010 was already signaled during inspections of the Consortium in December 2008 and April 2009, although the roof was still considered in good condition then.1974 Dr. Egan recognizes that \"it is entirely possible that the minimal corrosion identified in April 2009 rapidly progressed and became visible in December 2010\".1975 As a result, the Tribunal finds it reasonable to consider that the cause of the corrosion can be traced back to the Consortium's operatorship.\n\nConsortium Block 7 and 21 \u2013 Block 7 Monthly Inspection of Tanks, 2 July 2008 (**Exh. CE-CC-** **164**), pp. 15 and 58, and Monthly Inspection Report for Gacela Tank T-104, 4 April 2009 (**Exh. CE-CC-341**).\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6 89.\n\n958.\n\nThe Tribunal thus grants damages in the amount of USD 293,442.00, which Ecuador spent to repair the Gacela T-104 tank.1976 It notes that Burlington has not challenged the quantification of this claim as such.\n\nLuna WS4, Annex 90.\n\n**b. Payamino T-102 tank**\n--------------------------\n\n959.\n\nEcuador submits that inspections of the Payamino tank took place between 2010 and 2011. In support, it provides the contract signed between Petroamazonas and Conduto to perform the repairs on tank T-102 which focused mainly on cleaning and painting the tank both internally and externally.1977 This document does not contain a description of the state of the tank at that time.\n\nMontenegro WS3, Annex 5.\n\n960.\n\nThe documentary evidence regarding the state of this tank before July 2009 is found in a document prepared by the Consortium in April 2008 setting out the basis for the bidding process to repair the Coca and Payamino tanks.1978 It shows that, in March 2008, this tank was not in a critical condition but was in need of further inspection and reparation. The document specifically mentions that the T-102 tank should be cleaned and painted.1979 Dr. Egan recognizes this, but notes that \"[b]ased on this repair report, the Consortium developed a project plan with a proposed start date of October 2009 and a duration of eight weeks to conduct the necessary repairs\", but by that time the Consortium was no longer operating the Blocks.1980\n\nSol\u00eds WS2, Annex 34. The SGS Reports are again not relevant in this context as they make no specific reference to this tank.\n\nSol\u00eds WS2, Annex 34, pp. 60-62 in the Spanish version and pp. 15-17 in the English translation.\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6 93, referring to: Remediation report on incident in Mono CPF, including subsequent communications and approvals, July to October 2008 (**Exh. CE-CC-343**).\n\n961.\n\nThis may have been so, but the record shows that this tank developed corrosion beyond normal wear and tear during the Consortium's watch and that on the date of the takeover it had not been repaired. Ecuador claims USD 322,960.42 for the repairs done to this tank,1981 an amount that Burlington does not dispute as such. However, the Tribunal notes that the amount claimed by Ecuador includes repairs made to pipelines and other items. While the Tribunal considers that Ecuador's pipeline claim is justified (see Section 2.4 below), it finds that Ecuador has not justified the claims for other repairs and improvements itemized in Mr. Montenegro's Annex 3. After a review of this document, the Tribunal grants this claim in an amount of USD 210,130.76, which is the amount that in the Tribunal's view may be attributed to repairs made to tank T-102 and pipelines.1982\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 410, Montenegro WS1, Annex 3.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal has reviewed Mr. Montenegro's Annex 3, which contains the list of items adding up to the total amount claimed by Ecuador, and has subtracted all items that manifestly do not relate to repairs done to Payamino Tank T-102 or pipelines, such as, *inter alia*, improvements done to the Jaguar camp's dining room and kitchen, or replacement of floors in the Yuralpa offices.\n\n**c. Yuralpa T-400 tank**\n-------------------------\n\n962.\n\nIn connection with the Yuralpa T-400 tank, two inspections were carried out in March 2011. The first inspection recommended a complete repair of the interior of the tank and identified some punctures in the body and roof of the tank that did not pose \"an immediate risk to the mechanical and structural integrity of the vessel\".1983 The second inspection carried out in the same month after having \"sand blasted\" the tank concluded that \"[d]espite punctures present in the roof slaps and beams, there is no evidence of any problems that could put mechanical and structural integrity of the container at immediate risk. We recommend carrying out a careful application of the lining [...] as well as keeping an annual monitoring program for the thickness of the tank roof\".1984 The repairs were subsequently carried out by Conduto.1985 However, all references to Yuralpa T-400 in the SGS Reports indicate that the elements composing this tank were in \"good\" or \"very good\" condition.1986\n\nLuna WS4, Annex 52, p. 6 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n*Id*., Annex 53, p. 5 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n*Id*., Annex 54.\n\nSee, for instance: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, Inventory Report, 2009, \"Amortizable B21\", lines 604 *et seq* (**Exh. CE-CC-217**).\n\n963.\n\nSince the first inspection identifying a defective condition of this tank dates from March 2011, which is about 20 months after the Consortium had left the fields, and the SGS Report of June 2009 describes the condition of the components of this tank as \"good\" or \"very good\", the Tribunal considers that Ecuador has not established that any damage to this equipment and costs incurred in relation to the condition of this equipment were caused by the Consortium. As a result, it dismisses this claim.\n\n964.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal grants the claim related to tanks in part in respect of the Gacela T-104 and the Payamino T-102 tanks in an aggregate amount of USD 503,572.76.\n\n**2.4 Claims related to fluid lines and pipelines**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**2.4.1 Ecuador's position**\n----------------------------\n\n965.\n\nEcuador submits that the Consortium failed to repair, replace and/or properly maintain fluid lines and pipelines. According to the Respondent, fluid lines transport production fluid (a mixture of crude, gas and formation water, a very corrosive water) from the wellhead to the CPF, where it is filtered, while pipelines transport the crude from the CPF to the main pipeline through which the crude leaves the block.1987\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 379.\n\n966.\n\nEcuador argues that the Consortium did not have a proper pipeline and fluid line maintenance program. Block 7 had more than 100 kilometers of old and badly maintained fluid lines and pipelines, and neither of the two most important pipelines in Block 7 was replaced or properly maintained. The Consortium did not even have the specialized personnel required to monitor the state of its fluid lines and pipelines.1988\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 380.\n\n967.\n\nMr. Sol\u00eds described the poor state of the Consortium's fluid lines and pipelines as \"one of the most serious problems we had\".1989 According to Mr. Sol\u00eds, Repsol performed fluid line and pipeline maintenance on a weekly basis, whereas no maintenance was ever done by the Consortium. Fluid lines and pipelines were thus in a state of decay by July 2009, with no maintenance records or corrosion data.1990 Mr. Sol\u00eds notes in particular that the Consortium failed to \"pig\" its pipelines.1991\n\nSol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6 17.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 22.\n\n968.\n\nAs a result, when Petroamazonas arrived on the Blocks in July 2009, it \"inherited a network of decayed pipes, especially in Block 7, with no maintenance records or data as to the state of corrosion of the pipes, with the corresponding operational and environmental risks. Petroamazonas had, therefore, at great expense, to commission technical studies and replace portions of the pipelines\".1992\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 385, referring to: Luna WS2, \u00b6 11-13 and Annex 5; Montenegro WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.\n\n969.\n\nSpecifically, Ecuador explains that Petroamazonas commissioned technical studies for two pipelines: (i) the 12-kilometer pipeline connecting the Gacela and Coca CPFs, commissioned to SETE (March 2011, the \"SETE Report\"),1993 and (ii) a 37-kilometer section of the pipeline connecting the Mono/Jaguar/Oso CPF with the Gacela CPF, commissioned to Petroenergy (January 2012, the \"Petroenergy Report\").1994 According to Ecuador, the SETE Report concluded that various sections of the Gacela-Coca pipeline needed to be urgently replaced due to severe corrosion and physical damage, while the Petroenergy Report identified 296 defects in the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela pipeline, of which 44 were considered critical and thus requiring immediate repair.1995 As a consequence, several replacement and repair works were carried out.\n\nInspecci\u00f3n UT de la L\u00ednea de Transferencia Gacela-Payamino-Coca 8\" NPS, 17 March 2011; see: Luna WS2, Annex 5.\n\nInforme Final de Inspecci\u00f3n del Sistema de Protecci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3dica CIS \u2013 ACVG \u2013 PH-Resistividad Jaguar 5 \u2013 Lobo 3, January 2012; see: Luna WS3, Annex 14.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 381-388.\n\n970.\n\nEcuador thus seeks to recover USD 1,667,655.83, i.e. the amount spent on the assessment and repair of the pipelines and fluid lines.1996 In addition, the Respondent alleges that it built two new pipelines, although this cost is not included in its claim.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Slide 136; Luna WS2, Annexes 8, 10, 12 and Luna WS4, Annexes 93 to 96.\n\n**2.4.2 Burlington's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n971.\n\nBurlington contends that the Consortium had a comprehensive pipeline and fluid line maintenance program that adequately addressed both external and internal corrosion. For Burlington, this is confirmed by the fact that Ecuador's pipeline claim concerns only a very small percentage of the entire pipeline network of the Blocks. It follows that the vast majority of the pipelines were in good working condition.1997 In any event, Burlington argues that the Consortium's proper maintenance of the pipelines is confirmed by its maintenance records.1998\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 574-575; Rejoinder, \u00b6 389; D'Argentr\u00e9 WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 256, referring to: Visual Inspection of Payamino Gacela Pipelines, 2008, p. 0003 (**Exh.

The Consortium carried out a thorough pipeline inspection in 2004 and, as the API standards only require such inspections every 5 years, the next comprehensive inspection of the pipelines was not due until the end of 2009.2000 In any event, in the 2004-2009 period the Consortium performed regular visual inspections, and employed standard industry methods in its maintenance practices.2001\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 392; Intertek ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 104-105.\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 80.\n\n974.\n\nWith respect to (ii), Burlington observes that the practice of pigging is only one of several methods to clean pipelines and is not required under industry standards. Indeed, due to their configuration, many pipelines were \"unpiggable\".2002 The Consortium's decision to use chemical injection was thus reasonable and in any event equally effective.2003\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 393.\n\n*Ibid*., referring to: D'Argentr\u00e9 WS1, \u00b6 82; Intertek ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 106-108.\n\n975.\n\nBurlington denies that the SETE and Petroenergy Reports provide evidence that there were serious problems with the pipelines at the time when Ecuador took over the Blocks. Burlington argues that these reports (i) do not actually report \"decayed pipes\"; (ii) to the contrary, they report problems that amount to typical wear and tear which were inexpensive to fix and arise along less than 50 km of pipeline; and (iii) speak of conditions of the pipelines over a year after Ecuador's takeover.2004\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 581-588.\n\n976.\n\nAccording to Burlington, the Respondent's claim is for costs that relate to routine maintenance activities. The inspection carried out by SETE was part of a normal pipeline maintenance schedule under API standards that only came due after the Respondent took over the Blocks. Similarly, the corrosion inspection carried out by Petroenergy is an inspection that any operator must conduct as part of routine maintenance. Burlington further contends that the objective of both inspections was to determine whether the existing system could handle Petroamazonas' increased production.2005\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 589-592.\n\n**2.4.3 Discussion**\n--------------------\n\n977.\n\nEcuador argues that the Consortium failed to carry out proper maintenance of the fluid lines and pipelines and, as a result, the Consortium must compensate Petroamazonas for the cost of assessing and repairing the pipelines.\n\n978.\n\nThe Parties' positions differ widely as to whether the Consortium complied with its obligation to carry out proper maintenance for fluid lines and pipelines. While Ecuador and its witnesses emphatically assert that the Consortium did not have a maintenance program in place, and \"never\" carried out maintenance activities, Burlington and its witness and expert strongly affirms that it did have a maintenance program in place, citing numerous maintenance records in support.\n\n979.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that Burlington did not appear to have a \"written, forward looking maintenance plan\" in place for the Consortium's pipelines and fluid lines.2006 Mr. D'Argentr\u00e9 was unable to point to a specific document in the record, and contended instead that the pipeline management plan was \"live\".2007 One can only speculate as to what Mr. D'Argentr\u00e9 meant by \"live\", but if a pipeline maintenance program was in place in an operation such as the Consortium's, it is implausible that there would have been no comprehensive record of such a program. Mr. D'Argentr\u00e9 clarified that he was not saying that no written plan existed, but rather that he did not have access to it.2008 It remains, however, that no written maintenance plan has been submitted into the record.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 945.\n\nTr. (Day 6) (ENG), 2063:11-2064:18 (Cross, D'Argentr\u00e9).\n\nTr. (Day 6) (ENG), 2063:20-2064:6 (Cross, D'Argentr\u00e9).\n\n980.\n\nContrary to what Dr. Egan suggests,2009 the manual entitled entitled \"Program of Inspection and Integrity Management\" to which he refers does not appear to be a pipeline maintenance program, but rather a report on the details of the different pipelines in Block 7.2010 Indeed, despite its name, this document indicates that no \"integrity management programme\" is available for any of the pipelines recorded.2011 And as Ecuador points out, had this document indeed been a pipeline management program, Mr. D'Argentr\u00e9 would have referred to it.2012\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 79.\n\nInspection and Integrity Management Program, September 2008 (**Exh. CE-CC-175**).\n\n*Id*., pp. 3-8.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 942(a).\n\n981.\n\nThat being said, Burlington has submitted numerous maintenance records showing that it carried out maintenance of the pipelines, including (i) visual inspections and ultrasonic thickness measurements;2013 (ii) chemical injection programs designed to prevent internal corrosion of pipelines;2014 (iii) cathodic protection of pipelines;2015 and (iv) inspections and repairs of buried pipelines.2016 The Tribunal thus concludes that the Consortium did carry out maintenance activities with respect to fluid lines and pipelines.\n\nVisual Inspection of Payamino Gacela Pipelines, 2008, p. 0003 (**Exh.

CE-CC-379**).\n\n982.\n\nWhether these maintenance activities were in accordance with industry standards is a different question. Dr. Egan affirms that they were;2017 Mr. Sol\u00eds strongly disagrees.2018 The Tribunal is satisfied that, pursuant to the industry standards, the Consortium did not need to carry out another comprehensive inspection of its pipelines until late 2009 (i.e., after the takeover), as the relevant standard (API RP570 - Piping Inspection Code) requires major inspections to be carried out every 5 years. It also finds that the Consortium's failure to use \"pigging\" to clean its pipelines was not in breach of industry standards.\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 79-98.\n\nSol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 17-23; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 57-72.\n\n983.\n\nWhether the Consortium complied with industry standards in its other maintenance activities is more difficult to establish. The Tribunal notes that a 2011 Petroamazonas report on the mechanical integrity of the transfer pipeline between Oso/Mono and Gacela, to which Mr. Luna refers, notes that several parts of that pipeline had not received preventive maintenance since its entry into service.2019 While this report refers to a single pipeline, it suggests that the Consortium's maintenance of pipelines was substandard.\n\nPetroamazonas, Mechanical Integrity Maintenance Department, Report 001-11 of 3 Jannuary 2011, \"Integridad mec\u00e1nica de oleoducto de transferencia Oso y Mono hacia Gacela\"; Luna WS4, Annex 47, p. 10, noting *inter alia* that there has been no preventive maintenance in the Mono-Lobo or Lobo-Gacela sections, or in the OPF line (Oso CPF)-Tie in Jaguar or SPF line (Oso 9) \u2013 OPF (Oso CPF).\n\n984.\n\nUltimately, however, what matters here is whether the pipelines that Petroamazonas received at the takeover were in a condition beyond normal wear and tear. The Tribunal has noted the emphatic testimony of Messrs. Luna, Montenegro and Sol\u00eds, all of whom attested to the dire conditions of the pipelines at the time of the takeover.2020 The evidence of these three witnesses with direct, contemporaneous knowledge of the state of the pipelines is a relevant indication which must be assessed together with the documentation in the record.\n\nSol\u00eds WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 17-23; Sol\u00eds WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 57-72; Luna WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13 and Annex 5; Montenegro WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.\n\n985.\n\nThere are three comprehensive studies of the state of the pipelines in Block 7 on record:\n\ni. The report prepared by the Consortium in November 2004 (the \"Consortium Report\");2021\n\nii. The SETE Report commissioned by Petroamazonas in March 2011 (the \"SETE Report\");2022 and\n\niii.

CE-CC-63**).\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 5.\n\nLuna WS3, Annex 14.\n\n986.\n\nWhile none of these reports is contemporaneous to the takeover, they provide evidence with respect to the state of the pipelines at various points in time.\n\n987.\n\nThe Consortium Report was prepared nearly five years before the Respondent took over the Blocks. It covers part of Block 7, in particular the Gacela, Payamino, Coca and Oso fields and applies standards API 570, ASME B31.3, ASME B31.4, ASME B36.10M, and NACE RP-01-75. Out of all the lines examined, nothing of relevance is signaled, except for a recommendation of regular re-inspection and monitoring in respect of formalities.2024\n\nDepartment of Constructions, Report of Measured Thickness in the Flow Lines and Pipelines of Block 7, 2004, pp. 135-136, in connection with Gacela 3; Coca 6 and Coca 8; Coca 19 (**Exh. CE-CC-63**).\n\n988.\n\nDrafted 18 months after the Blocks were taken over by Petroamazonas, the SETE Report relates to a 12 km pipeline connecting Gacela CPF to Coca CPF. The purpose of this report was among others to:\n\n- \"Determine the current state of the line [\u2026]\n\n- Identify the areas that require repairs or replacement of sections [\u2026]\n\n- Assess the results obtained applying the standards provided by ASME B31.4 \u2013 ASME B31G \u2013 API 570\".2025\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 5, p. 2.\n\n989.\n\nThe SETE Report concluded that the pipeline had suffered no \"severe\" internal corrosion, but that sections of the line showed general external corrosion that in some instances required urgent attention. Specifically, the report observed:\n\n- \"[\u2026] the line during the operating period of 19 years did not suffer severe internal corrosive processes, as in average the percentage of loss of thickness does not exceed 30% with respect to its nominal thickness. It must be clarified that if no severe corrosive processes exist, this value should not represent immediate risks for the integrity of the pipeline\".2026\n\n- \"There are several sections with generalised external corrosion representing up to 50% of material loss in respect of nominal thickness.

The report states:\n\n\"Considering a homogenous loss of thickness of the remaining wall and assuming that there will be no problems of external corrosion, the remaining life calculated in these conditions would be 25 years. Given that in this particular case there are problems of severe external corrosion added to a loss of thickness of the wall, [which is] normal in this type of lines due to the time of service and to the type of fluid. One observe [sic] sections with a reduction in thickness of 70%, which would represent a remaining life of 0 years in the sections affected by corrosive processes\".2034\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 90-91.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 91.\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 5, pp. 7-8 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n992.\n\nWhile the drafting of this paragraph is awkward, the Tribunal understands it to be saying that, assuming a homogeneous loss of wall thickness and no external corrosion, the useful life of the pipelines should be of 25 years. However, given that in this particular case there are severe problems of external corrosion, added to a the loss of wall thickness (the latter being normal in this type of pipelines due to the years of service and the type of fluid), there are sections with a reduction of wall thickness of up to 70%, which implies 0 years of remaining useful life for the sections affected by the corrosive processes. While the report acknowledges that the loss of wall thickness is due to normal wear and tear, it is less clear whether the same applies to external corrosion. Seen together with the report's conclusion that external corrosion is caused by a lack of external coating, the Tribunal concludes that the deterioration of these particular sections was caused by a lack of proper maintenance and cannot be attributed to normal wear and tear. Although the report is dated March 2011, i.e. over one year and a half after Petroamazonas' takeover, the Tribunal finds that the lack of external coating can be attributed to the Consortium's operatorship for the following reasons.\n\n993.\n\nDr. Egan acknowledges that there are \"isolated\" instances of severe corrosion, but opines that Ecuador's claims are exaggerated. Dr. Egan explains that \"there were only two pipe sections out of a total number of 981 pipe sections in the 12 km long pipeline that had external corrosion that required replacement\", which \"represents approximately 0.2% of the pipe sections\".2035 He adds that \"[e]ach of the pipe sections is about 12 meters in length, and it is most likely that the external corrosion is concentrated in an area of approximately one foot long, which means the amount of the pipeline that would need replacement is closer to 0.02%\".2036 In addition, he asserts that \"[t]hese two affected pipe sections appear in a pipe section that was intentionally designed to have a thinner wall, as demonstrated by the green line in Figure 6-2\", so \"the fact that the wall was thin is in part due to the original design of the pipeline system, rather than corrosion\".2037 Dr. Egan further asserts that \"external corrosion and coating damage are easily repaired by sand blasting to bare metal and recoating to inhibit the corrosion\".2038 By contrast, Mr. Luna asserts that all 64 sections that evidenced external corrosion must be replaced.2039\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 93.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 107.\n\n994.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the SETE Report only recommends the replacement of those sections affected by \"severe\" external corrosion:\n\n\"Following the recommendation of ASME B31.G, the sections of the fluid line with severe external corrosion must be replaced. There are pittings of a depth of up to 4mm [\u2026]\".2040\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 5, p. 11 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n995.\n\nThe SETE Report also notes that these sections are identified in \"reporte UT-002-SETE-2011, Anexo 1\",2041 but this document is not in the record. Dr. Egan has not explained which sections of the pipeline he considers to have shown severe corrosion requiring replacement, but a review of the graphs included in the SETE Report appear to confirm that only two sections were close to the withdrawal limit of the pipeline due to external corrosion: (i) tubes 692, 693 and 694, and (ii) tube 980.2042\n\n**GRAFICA 2.** Corrosi\u00f3n Externa con Respecto al Espesor Nominal\n\n*Id*., p. 12.\n\n*Id*., p. 7 (graph 2).\n\n996.\n\nAbsent other evidence in the record, the Tribunal accepts Dr. Egan's assessment that each of these sections refers to approximately 12 meters of pipeline (24 meters in total), representing approximately 0.2% of the length of the pipeline. Dr. Egan also opines that \"it is most likely that the external corrosion is concentrated in an area of approximately one foot long, which means the amount of the pipeline that would need replacement is closer to 0.02%\".2043 This latter opinion appears unsubstantiated and thus the Tribunal concludes that approximately 0.2% of the Gacela-Coca pipeline requires replacement.\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 93.\n\n997.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that there appears to be one instance of severe internal corrosion (tube 908), as shown in the figure below.2044 As a result, it also considers that this tube was beyond normal wear and tear.\n\n**GRAFICA 1.** Perfil de Espesores de la L\u00ednea de Transferencia 8\" NPS\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 5, p. 7 (graph 1).\n\n998.\n\nMr. Luna also emphasizes that the SETE Report indicatated that there were 16 buried lines, in which 32 interphase sections were \"completely deteriorated\".2045 As a result, it recommended \"a comprehensive recovery of the interphase areas of the buried lines, including welding of covers if the case so requires and a subsequent application of a system of external coating together with a system of protection with mechanic tape\".2046 Dr. Egan does not respond to this point. Be this as it may, SETE's observation that the protective coating of the interphases is \"completely deteriorated\" indicates that it was indeed beyond normal wear and tear.\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 108. See also: Luna WS2, Annex 5, p. 8-9.\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 5, p. 12 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n999.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the results of the Petroenergy Report, which was issued in January 2012, almost two and a half years after Petroamazonas took over the Blocks. Based on standard NACE SP0619-07, this report studies the corrosion levels of part of the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline, in particular the 37 km connecting Jaguar to Lobo. It identified a number of defects which it classified in terms of severity and need for intervention as follows:2047\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **N\u00daMERO TOTAL** **DE DEFECTOS** | SEVERIDAD (%IR) | **65-80%** CORTO PLAZO MAX. 3 M ESES CATEGORIA 3 | **80-100%** **INMEDIATO** **CATEGOR\u00cdA 4** |\n| **1-50%** **LARGO PLAZO** **M\u00c1S DE 1A\u00d1O**\u00a0**CATEGOR\u00cdA 1** | **50-65%** **MEDIANO PLAZO** **MAX.8 MESES** **CATEGOR\u00cdA 2** |\n| 295 [ | 93 | 97 | 62 | **44** |\n| **Cuadro 2 DISCRIMINACI\u00d3N DE DEFECTOS POR SU \u00cdNDICE DE SEVERIDAD** |  |\n\nLuna WS3, Annex 14, p. 4.\n\n1000.\n\nAccordingly, 15% of the defects required an immediate intervention (category 4), 21% within three months (category 3), 33% within eight months (category 2), while the rest, i.e. 31% could wait over one year (category 1), as the following graph illustrates:2048\n\n**GR\u00c1FICA 1 PORCENTAJES DE DISTRIBUCI\u00d3N DE FALLAS DE REVESTIMIENTO V/S SEVERIDAD**\n\n*Ib\u00edd.*\n\n1001.\n\nIn addition, the Petroenergy Report concludes that there is severe corrosion in 91.1% of the 37 km or pipeline reviewed.2049\n\n*Id.,* p. 6.\n\n1002.\n\nIn Dr. Egan's opinion neither of the tests carried out by Petroenergy (the ACVG test nor the pH test) can be used to draw conclusions on the current condition of the pipeline or its state of corrosion; rather the ACVG test \"is an indicator of whether active corrosion will become an issue in the future\", while the pH test \"analyzes the activity of the hydrogen ion in the soil in which the pipeline is buried in order to identify an environment conducive to corrosion\".2050 According to Dr. Egan, the defects identified in the report \"are not defects in the sense that they will impact the structural integrity of the line but rather are indications of coating breaches\".2051 Indeed, Dr. Egan notes that the report concludes that \"99.90% of the cathodic protection levels complied with the second criterion of NACE International Standard SP0169\".2052\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6 122.\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 96.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 97.\n\n1003.\n\nMr. Luna does not address these explanations, but emphasizes the following aspects:\n\ni. \"The results of the alternating current gradient measurement (ACVG technique), which shows the condition of the external casing of the buried pipe: 296 defects, of which 44 were critical, 62 should be repaired in a period of not more than 3 months, 97 should be repaired in 8 months, and 93 in one year\";\n\nii. \"The results of the hydrogen potential (HP) concentration level study: 91.1% with severe external corrosion, 7.9% with moderate corrosion and only 1.1% had a neutral tendency\".2053\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 109 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n1004.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted Dr. Egan's opinion, but cannot overlook the fact that Petroenergy identified 296 defects in the pipeline, 15% of which required immediate attention and another 21% required short-term attention (within 3 months). While it is true that a period of two and a half years had elapsed since the takeover, the Tribunal finds it likely that the defects requiring immediate or short-term attention were caused before Petroamazonas' takeover. It thus finds that Ecuador has proved that a significant part of the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline was beyond normal wear and tear.\n\n1005.\n\nEcuador seeks USD 1,667,655.83 for this claim,2054 relying on Mr. Luna's testimony. However, the Tribunal notes that, in his last witness statement, Mr. Luna quantifies the damages related to pipelines at USD 1,462,553.43, broken down as follows:2055\n\ni. The cost of retaining SETE to perform the inspection of the Gacela-Coca pipeline (USD 272,560.41).2056\n\nii. The cost of retaining Petroenergy to perform external corrosion tests on the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline (USD 151,300).2057\n\niii. The cost of engaging PEC to repair 106 out of the 296 defects identified by the Petroenergy Report in the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline (USD 489,404.44).2058 Mr. Luna emphasizes that PEC has repaired only the 44 defects identified as urgent as well as the 62 defects identified as requiring an intervention within three months.2059\n\niv. The cost of engaging Sertecpet S.A. to maintain fluid lines, including changes of pipes, sleeves and welding in Block 7 (in the Gacela, Payamino, Coca and Jaguar fields) between April and August 2012 (USD 355,422.98).2060\n\nv. The cost of engaging Sachatechnology Multiservicios Cia. Ltda. to perform excavation services for the maintenance of pipelines and support to Sertecpect in Block 7, and the maintenance of tubes in Block 21 (USD 193,865.60).2061\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Slide 136.\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6\u00b6 162-170.\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 6.\n\nLuna WS3, Annex 15.\n\nLuna WS4, Annex 91.\n\nWhile Mr. Luna states that 110 defects have been repaired, he must have meant 106 (44+62). Indeed, he also states that 97 Category 1 defects and 93 Category 2 defects (a total of 190 defects) still remain to be repaired (Luna WS4, \u00b6 168). As Petroenergy identified a total of 296 defects, this must mean that only 106 defects (296-190) have been repaired.\n\nLuna WS4, Annexes 93 and 94.\n\n*Id*., Annexes 95 and 96.\n\n1006.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that significant parts of both the Gacela-Coca and Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela pipelines were beyond normal wear and tear. In reliance on this finding and on the testimonies of Messrs. Luna, Sol\u00eds and Montenegro, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to extrapolate this observation to the remainder of the pipelines in the Blocks. Even if the Consortium had a maintenance program in place and had carried out comprehensive inspections in a timely fashion, the Consortium's maintenance efforts were clearly insufficient to maintain the pipelines in good working condition. The Tribunal also notes that Ecuador is not requesting the replacement of the pipeline system, but has limited its claims to the cost of two inspections and urgent or necessary repairs. The Tribunal thus grants this claim in the amounts identified by Mr. Luna, for a total of USD 1,462,553.43. Awarding this amount, it notes that Burlington did not dispute the quantification of this claim for itself.\n\n**2.5 Claims related to generator engines**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1007.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, as a result of the Consortium's substandard maintenance of a number of power generator engines in Blocks 7 and 21, the engines were in an appalling state when it arrived on the Blocks. Ecuador's claim focuses on W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engines 2, 3, and 4 in Block 21 and on all 27 Caterpillar engines in Block 7.2062 Ecuador accuses Burlington in particular of (i) a lack of proper overhauls to these engines, and (ii) the inappropriate use of a harmful crude-diesel fuel mix in the Block 7 engines.\n\n*Id*., Annexes 81 and 82.\n\n1008.\n\nEcuador claims that these deficiencies caused significant harm to the engines and resulted in Ecuador incurring damages in the form of costs associated with the performance of overdue overhauls, reduced engine life, and the purchase of a new alternator for W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engine 4. Ecuador claims the total of these costs amounting to USD 6,540,010.57,2063 of which USD 4,744,733.75 relate to Block 21 and USD 1,795,276.80 concern Block 7.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Slide 136. Luna WS2, Annex 13; Luna WS3, Annexes 14-15; Otros gastos de reacondicionamiento de los Bloques, amended version (**Exh. E-301**).\n\n1009.\n\nBurlington dismisses Ecuador's claims as grave accusations unsupported by the evidence.\n\n1010.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the claims with respect to overhauls (2.5.1), and then those related to the use of the crude-diesel mix (2.5.2).\n\n**2.5.1 Overhauls**\n-------------------\n\n**a. Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n1011.\n\nEcuador explains that, because Blocks 7 and 21 are in remote areas, the power required for the operations must be generated locally. The Consortium thus installed several Caterpillar diesel engine generators at every platform or CPF in Block 7, and four W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engines in Block 21. The engines must run 24 hours a day. To ensure their proper performance, they must undergo routine maintenance and also regularly scheduled major maintenance or overhauls.2064\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 389-398; Luna WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 8-13.\n\n1012.\n\nEcuador alleges that the individualized assessment which it carried out upon arrival in the Blocks (which was necessary because the Consortium appeared to have kept no engine maintenance records) showed that the Consortium had failed to perform regular overhauls to the engines prior to July 2009. It asserts that \"the state of the engines in both Blocks was appalling\".2065 As a result, says Ecuador, it had to overhaul all 27 Caterpillar engines of Block 7, and W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engines 2, 3 and 4 of Block 21, in addition to buying a new alternator for W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engine 4 and supplementing the existing stock of spare parts.2066\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 973.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 389-398; Luna WS1, \u00b6 14-15; Luna WS2, Annex 8.\n\n1013.\n\nEcuador rejects Dr. Egan's assessment of the Consortium's maintenance of the engines. According to Ecuador and Mr. Luna, the Consortium's own documents show that Ecuador's claim regarding delayed overhauls on the engines listed above is \"grounded and duly documented\".2067\n\nReply, \u00b6 502, referring to: Luna WS4, \u00b6\u00b6 130-143; List of Corrective, Planned, and Preventative Maintenance Orders, 5 September 2012 (**Exh. CE-CC-264**), and Luna WS4, Annexes 30, 31,80 and 81.\n\n**b. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1014.\n\nBurlington denies that it failed to perform regular overhauls of the engines. It contends that the Consortium had \"a robust maintenance program in place\" as W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 overhauls were carried out by W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engineers at the intervals prescribed by the manufacturer, and Caterpillar engine overhauls were done by Consortium engineers in accordance with Caterpillar's recommended guidelines.2068 Burlington also alleges that it submitted annual activity reports to the Government which included information on its overhauls,2069 and provided extensive records of maintenance activities.2070\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 559; W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 Services, Business White Paper: Lifecycle Efficiency, 2011 (**Exh.

Specifically:\n\ni. With respect to the W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engines in Block 21, after having reviewed the Consortium's service contract and its maintenance records, Dr. Egan concluded that the Consortium had performed overhauls in a timely fashion and in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.2071 Relying on Dr. Egan's testimony, Burlington argues that \"[g]iven that the W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engines were to be overhauled every 12,000 hours (i.e., every 1.36 years if constantly running), Ecuador's claims for the overhaul of these engines are nothing more than a disguised attempt to obtain reimbursement of post-July 2009 regular maintenance costs for which the Consortium cannot be held liable\".2072\n\nii. As to the Caterpillar engines in Block 7, after reviewing the Consortium's maintenance records and Mr. Luna's witness statement, Dr. Egan concluded that the Consortium did not delay overhauls; rather, Ecuador claims for several engines that had been recently overhauled by the Consortium and as a result could not have been due for overhaul at the time of the takeover.2073\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 560, referring to: Intertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 560, referring to: Intertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 561, referring to: Intertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.\n\n1016.\n\nIn his second report, Dr. Egan dismisses Mr. Luna's criticisms and confirms his conclusions, both with respect to the Caterpillar and W\u00e1rstil\u00e1 engines.2074\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 39-70.\n\n1017.\n\nBurlington argues that, because the Consortium performed the required maintenance, Ecuador's claim for the increase of maintenance costs and decrease in the engines' useful life should be dismissed. However, even assuming *quod non* that it did not carry out the required maintenance, Burlington, relying on Dr. Egan, contends that \"Ecuador has not provided any scientific or engineering basis for concluding that any hypothetical delay would create such an increase in subsequent overhaul costs or reduction of the useful life\".2075 The claim for the costs of purchasing and installing a new alternator must also be dismissed, because such costs do not qualify as \"overhaul\" costs.2076\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 563, referring to: Intertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 67-71.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 563 referring to: Luna WS2, p. 8; Intertek ER1, \u00b6 59.\n\n1018.\n\nMore generally, Burlington argues that, had it not performed regular overhauls on the engines, it would not have been able to maintain or increase production levels, because without the engines there is no power, and without power there is no production. For this reason, it asserts that between December 2005 and July 2009 it spent almost USD 3 million in spare parts for the Caterpillar engines alone.2077\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 564, referring to: Perenco Ecuador Limited, Caterpillar Cost Details, 2006-2009, p. 16 (**Exh. CE-CC-105**).\n\n**c. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1019.\n\nIt is undisputed that engines require preventive maintenance such as monitoring and testing and overhauls, in which engines are taken apart to be examined and repaired if necessary.2078\n\nSee, for instance: Intertek ER1, \u00b6 54.\n\n1020.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, including in particular Mr. Luna's witness statements, Dr. Egan's expert reports, and the Consortium's maintenance records, the Tribunal concludes that Ecuador has failed to provide sufficient evidence of the Consortium's alleged failure to perform timely overhauls to its generator engines, or to prove that such failure increased the maintenance costs or reduced the useful life of the engines.\n\n1021.\n\nWith respect to the Caterpillar engines in Block 7, the record shows that the Consortium put in place appropriate preventive and corrective maintenance programs. The Consortium's Annual Environmental Report for Block 7 for 2002, which was sent to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, contained a summary of preventive and corrective maintenance programs for engines and other Block 7 equipment.2079 There was no objection or protest from Ecuador to this letter at the time. Similarly, the Consortium's maintenance program in place since 2005 explained the parameters to be used for the maintenance of engines and other equipment, and specified in particular when Caterpillar engine overhauls must be carried out.2080 Specifically, this program explained that \"[m]aintenance of the Perenco equipment installed in Block 7 has been based on the recommendations of those equipment manufacturers, and according to the situation and environmental conditions in which they are operating\", and set out the periodicity in which the engines should be overhauled.2081\n\nLetter of 31 January 2003 from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to the Vincente Juepa (Ministry of Energy and Mines), attaching the Annual Environmental Report for Block 7 for 2002 (**Exh. CE-CC-213**).\n\nPerenco Maintenance Program for Block 7, 2005 (**Exh. CE-CC-100**).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n1022.\n\nAs to whether the Consortium performed overhauls to its Caterpillar engines in a timely fashion and the consequences of such alleged untimeliness, the Tribunal has noted the differing opinions and evidence presented by Mr. Luna and Dr. Egan. Having reviewed their respective statements and the evidence on which they rely, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Ecuador has not established that the Consortium delayed these overhauls, and more specifically:\n\ni. According to Dr. Egan, \"Caterpillar recommends that operators perform overhauls of Model 3406 engines every 6,000 hours and of Model 3412 every 10,000 hours\".2082 After reviewing the Consortium's maintenance records, Dr. Egan concluded that \"the Consortium's preventative maintenance program followed the per-hour overhaul recommendations provided by Caterpillar\".2083\n\nii. According to Dr. Egan, the logs generated by the Consortium's SAP database, as well as the Consortium's work orders, demonstrate that the Consortium performed overhauls in its Block 7 engines in a timely fashion.2084\n\niii. Mr. Luna alleges that, with respect to 14 engines (specifically, engines Nos. 1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 26), there is no indication of any overhaul between September 2007 and July 2009.2085 Dr. Egan notes however that Mr. Luna failed to take into account major overhauls and other maintenance activities performed by the Consortium in this time period.2086 As a result, Dr. Egan provided a revised version of Mr. Luna's Overhaul List for Caterpillar engines,2087 which he asserts \"clearly demonstrates that the Consortium adequately maintained the 14 Caterpillar engines cited by Mr. Luna\", showing that the Consortium either carried out a major overhaul of the engines at issue or performed other maintenance activities in accordance with its ongoing maintenance program.2088 The Tribunal accepts this revised list of maintenance activities. It also agrees with Dr. Egan that whether the Consortium carried out a proper maintenance of its engines is not limited to whether it performed \"major\" overhauls, and that consideration should also be given to other maintenance activities.2089\n\niv. Mr. Luna also states that the Consortium did not comply with the manufacturer's specifications with respect to 13 other engines by not performing overhauls within the appropriate time.2090 Mr. Luna accepts that the Consortium carried out overhauls to these engines within a period of approximately one year prior to the takeover of the Blocks (and thus no further overhauls were due before the takeover), but argues that the failure to perform overhauls before that period resulted in damage that increased the maintenance costs of these engines. Dr. Egan rejects this theory and the Tribunal agrees. As Dr. Egan explains, \"[o]nce an engine has been overhauled and the worn parts replaced or refurbished, there is no lasting damage to the engine that would result in increased maintenance costs for subsequent overhauls. If, in fact, there had been any increased overhaul cost from some earlier neglected or deferred maintenance in 2006 or 2007 for instance, it would have been borne by the Consortium when it conducted the most recent overhauls in 2008 or 2009. Only at that time would it be necessary to replace or repair more parts than normal\".2091\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 55, relying on: Caterpillar, Operation and Maintenance Manual 3406B and 3406C Industrial and Generator Set Engines, November 1999 (**Exh.

After reviewing the evidence in the record, the Tribunal agrees with Dr. Egan, for the following reasons:\n\ni. With respect to W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engine No. 2, Mr. Luna accepts that it was (correctly) overhauled at 24,000 hours, but asserts that in April 2010 Petroamazonas was forced to overhaul this engine at 32,000 hours (instead of at 36,000, which was the next scheduled overhaul). Mr. Luna alleges that this overhaul had to be brought forward due to leaks in the engine, but he does not explain how these leaks could have been attributed to an earlier lack of maintenance by the Consortium.2095\n\nii. With respect to W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engine No. 3, Mr. Luna acknowledges that the Consortium conducted a 12,000 hour overhaul in October 2006. Mr. Luna argues that no other overhaul was performed since then, but as explained by Dr. Egan the next overhaul was not due until July 2009. Given Ecuador's physical takeover on 16 July 2009, the Consortium cannot be held responsible for failing to carry out this overhaul. In any event, the record shows that the Consortium carried out additional maintenance at 16,000 hours.2096\n\niii. The Tribunal reaches a similar conclusion with respect to W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 engine No. 4. As Mr. Luna recognizes, this engine was only put into service in 2007. The record shows that the Consortium carried out various preventive maintenances, including a 4,000 hour overhaul in January 2008, but the first major overhaul (at 12,000 hours) was not due until January 2010, after Petroamazonas' takeover.2097\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 55; Intertek ER2, \u00b6 43.\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 137.\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 137(a) and Annexes 81 and 83; Intertek ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48; W\u00e1rtsil\u00e1 Ecuador S.A.

Indeed, even if the Tribunal had found evidence of untimely overhauls, it finds that Ecuador has failed to establish that such delays would have caused the increased costs which it claims. The Tribunal accepts Dr. Egan's explanation that \"[a]lthough a delay in overhauls may affect the performance of the engine (primarily power output and emissions levels), this will not necessarily increase the maintenance costs or reduce the useful life of the engine. At most, a delay in overhaul will affect the top part of the engine (i.e., valves, combustion chambers and injectors). However, these parts need to be replaced during overhauls regardless of the delay. In other words, there is no penalty for delaying overhauls\".2098 The record does not support a different conclusion.\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 68.\n\n1027.\n\nConsequently, this aspect of the engine claim is denied.\n\n**2.5.2 Use of crude-diesel fuel blend**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**a. Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n1028.\n\nEcuador contends that the Consortium failed to use the engines pursuant to the manufacturer's specifications. Instead of using diesel fuel as required, the Consortium altered the engines on Block 7 in order to use a cheaper diesel/crude mix containing crude produced in the Block (first a 50/50 blend, settling on a blend of 40% crude and 60% diesel after testing).2099\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 395-398; Luna WS1, \u00b6 16.\n\n1029.\n\nEcuador submits that the effect of these modifications was disastrous. Only a few weeks after making these modifications one of the engines broke down and eventually all of the engines were damaged.2100 As explained by Mr. Montenegro in his memorandum of 9 January 2011:\n\n\"The effect of this new fuel in the engines was immediately felt and was a disaster; exhaust gases changed color, the temperature of exhaust multiples increased and the fuel filters were saturated very soon. [\u2026] Few weeks later the first block of a Cat 3406 Engine for the Power Oil Units in the Coca Station broke; when the engine was taken apart we saw a great accumulation of crude in the internal walls, piston rods blocked, detached rod's bearings and bed caused by the lack of internal lubrication, [and] severe damage to the turbos and injection pumps. This happened again in various engines since it was not possible to predict when failure would occur [\u2026] After this event, all of the engines without exception were affected [\u2026] This fuel system was in place until March/09 [\u2026] but the engines were left damaged\".2101\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 395-398; Luna WS1, \u00b6 16.\n\nMemorandum \"Blending Plant. Afectaci\u00f3n a los motores CAT\", dated 9 January 2011, pp. 2-3 (Luna WS1, Annex 2) (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n**b. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1030.\n\nBurlington accepts that it used a crude-diesel fuel blend in Block 7, but contends that this choice was a reasonable one and had government approval, and in any event was carried out during a limited time, thus having no lasting impact on the engines.\n\n1031.\n\nDue to the sharp increase in diesel prices at the end of 2007, the Consortium began studying the possibility of using a crude-diesel fuel mix in the Caterpillar engines in Block 7. It tested the blend for six months. According to Burlington, this trial period showed that it was an appropriate fuel for the engines.\n\n1032.\n\nBurlington also argues that the use of such a blend was consistent with international industry practice, and that Perenco had used the blend before in other countries such as Turkey. Dr. Egan notes in particular that Caterpillar provides guidelines for using blended fuel in its engines, and that the Consortium complied with these guidelines: Caterpillar recommends that the blended fuel used in its engines have a maximum crude-to-diesel ratio of 45%, and the Consortium used a 40% crude-to-diesel blend ratio.2102\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 73, referring to: Caterpillar, Application and Installation Guide Diesel Fuels and Diesel Fuel Systems, 2012, Appendix 2 (**Exh. Ce-CC-260**).\n\n1033.\n\nBurlington also emphasizes that not only was the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum aware of this practice and of the Consortium's intent to use the blend in the Blocks, it also gave its approval to build the required fuel mixing plant, and Ministry representatives were present during the short period of time when the blend was used. Burlington further submits that, in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines, the Consortium conducted more frequent maintenance on the engines using the blend, thus avoiding any damage. It adds that, given that the blend was used only from August 2008 to February 2009, this practice could not have had, and in fact did not have, any lasting impact on the engines.2103\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 566-572, relying on: Intertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 72-76.\n\n**c. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1034.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that Burlington's use of a crude-diesel fuel blend in the engines in Block 7 may have impacted the engines' life and potentially led to higher maintenance costs for Ecuador after it took control of the Blocks. This is supported by Caterpillar's 2001 fuel recommendations, in which the engine manufacturer warns that, while permissible, the use of \"blended fuels\" can increase maintenance costs and reduce engine life:\n\n\"Diesel engines have the ability to burn a wide variety of fuels. These fuels are divided into two general groups. [\u2026] The preferred fuels provide maximum engine service life and performance. The preferred fuels are distillate fuels. These fuels are commonly called diesel fuel, [\u2026]. The permissible fuels are crude oil or *blended fuels*. *Use of these fuels can result in higher maintenance costs and in reduced engine service life*\".2104\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal. Luna WS4, Annex 85.\n\n1035.\n\nIt is true that Burlington alleges that the Consortium adopted an increased maintenance routine as recommended by the manufacturer.2105 Yet, the Tribunal notes that the Consortium decided to stop using the blend after seven months because of \"serious problems with the engines\" and \"an average of three engines a month that failed completely\", as explained by Mr. Sol\u00eds at the Hearing:\n\n\"We stopped using [the crude-diesel blend] because we had serious problems with the engines, all of the engines, at Block 7 when we used this mixture. This mixture may be used, but with engines that are manufactured to that end rather than the engines that we had back then at Block 7. Those engines were manufactured to operate only with diesel oil -- with diesel rather than a combination of crude oil and diesel. Perenco tried out that mix so as to reduce production costs. We had several failures with the engines, and I remember that we had an average of three engines a month that failed completely\".2106\n\nD'Argentr\u00e9 WS1, \u00b6 61.\n\nTr. (Day 6) (ENG), 1854:19-1855:8 (Direct, Sol\u00eds).\n\n1036.\n\nAs regards Burlington's contention that the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum knew of this practice, the Tribunal notes that the record indeed shows that the Ministry was aware that the Consortium was building a mixing plant at the Gacela CPF in August 2008 in order to use this blend in the Block 7 engines. For example, there is correspondence between the Consortium and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum between November 2007 to June 2008 referring to the trial period and the financial motivation behind the Consortium's choice. The Ministry's letters show no opposition to the use of the blend.2107 To the contrary, in February 2008, the National Hydrocarbons Directorate even authorized Perenco \"to use the crude oil coming from the percentage of its share set in the Participation Contract for Hydrocarbons Exploration and Production, combined with diesel as fuel for power generation in Block 7 and Coca Payamino Unified fields\".2108\n\nLetters between 6 November 2007 and 23 June 2008 between the Consortium and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum (**Exh. CE-CC-146**).\n\nLetter of 13 February 2008 from Javier Eg\u00fcez Espinosa (Ministry of Mines and Petroleum) to Eric D'Argentr\u00e9 (Perenco) (**Exh. CE-CC-157**). Other evidence of the Ministry's knowledge can be found at: Letter of 20 August 2008 from Alfredo Coronel (Perenco) to Vicente Guerra (DNH) (**Exh. CE-CC-174**) and Perenco Ecuador Limited, Record of Temporary Suspension of Blending Plant Meter, 11 February 2009 (**Exh. CE-CC-200**).\n\n1037.\n\nThat being said, although Ecuador was aware of and did not object to the Consortium's use of the blend, it remains that the responsibility for the good condition of the equipment lay with the Consortium. The record shows that the use of the blend, although permissible according to the manufacturer, could lead to higher maintenance costs and affect the engines' life. It also establishes that the Consortium itself discontinued its use of the fuel blend because it experienced problems with the operation of the engines.\n\n1038.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers it sufficiently established that the use of the blend affected the condition of the engines.\n\n1039.\n\nEcuador claims a total of USD 1,795,276.80 in connection with the engines in Block 7,2109 out of which USD 1,123,800 account for a reduction in the engines' useful life due to lack of regular maintenance and to the use of the crude-diesel blend.2110 Burlington does not dispute Ecuador's quantification as such, but argues that the claim has no technical support. As noted in paragraph 1026 above, the Tribunal has already rejected Ecuador's argument that Burlington's alleged lack of regular maintenance reduced the useful life of the engines, and Ecuador does not explain what portion of the reduction in useful life can be attributed to the use of the blend. In the exercise of its discretionary powers in matters of assessing the evidence and quantifying damages, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to grant Ecuador half of the amount claimed for the reduction of useful life of the Block 7 engines. The Tribunal thus grants this claim in an amount of USD 561,900.00.\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Slide 136.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 415; Luna WS2, Annex 10.\n\n**2.6 Claims related to pumps / electrical systems / IT equipment / road maintenance**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1040.\n\nEcuador alleges that, when Petroamazonas took over the operations in July 2009, it discovered that the Blocks' pumps, electrical systems, IT equipment, spare parts, and roads were in sub-standard condition. It thus argues that the Consortium failed to replace obsolete equipment and systems, install appropriate backup systems, hold a sufficient stock of spare parts, and maintain roads, and claims for the costs that Petroamazonas has had (or will have) to incur to upgrade these items.2111 Burlington opposes all of these claims. Due to their specific character, the Tribunal will address each claim separately.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 399-406; Otros gastos de reacondicionamiento de los Bloques, amended version (**Exh. E-301**).\n\n**2.6.1 Pumps**\n---------------\n\n**a. Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n1041.\n\nEcuador claims that the Consortium (i) operated with too few pumps and that those that it employed were obsolete, (ii) did no preventive or predictive maintenance, (iii) had either no or insufficient backup systems, and (iv) lacked the necessary stock of spare parts. Petroamazonas must thus purchase new pumps to replace the ones currently in place. However, since this is a costly and protracted process, at the time of its PostHearing Brief, it had not yet done so. At that time, it had performed overhauls in pumps 2 and 4 of Coca CPF, which it claims have cost USD 33,662.45.2112\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 123 and Annex 78.\n\n**b. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1042.\n\nBurlington stresses that Ecuador's damage claim focused initially on only 5 out of the 160 pumps on the two Blocks. Once it admitted that it had not yet replaced any pumps with new purchases, it reduced its claim to seek merely the costs of the overhaul of two pumps.2113\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 251 and note 343; Intertek ER2, \u00b6 124.\n\n1043.\n\nIn response to Ecuador's four arguments summarized in paragraph 1041 above, Burlington asserts that (i) the pumps were not obsolete in July 2009, pointing to the fact that Ecuador continued to use them well into its own operation period, (ii) it did have a comprehensive preventive and predictive maintenance program in place that complied with manufacturer guidelines, and conducted daily visual inspections, (iii) Ecuador's backup claim is \"yet another claim for equipment needed to handle Ecuador's increasing production activity, not to remedy the Consortium's lack of proper maintenance\", and (iv) the Consortium kept an adequate inventory of spare parts.2114\n\nCMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 593-601, referring to: D'Argentr\u00e9 WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42 and 69-71, and Intertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 147-148.\n\n**c. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1044.\n\nAt the time of the Hearing, Ecuador was still operating the pumps it claims are obsolete, but for two pumps in Coca CPF. On these latter two pumps, Ecuador in fact performed overhauls, the cost of which is quantified by Mr. Luna at USD 32,662.45 and claimed here.2115 The fact that 158 of the 160 pumps that were present in the Blocks when Petroamazonas took control of the operations in July 2009 have not been overhauled or replaced after the takeover leads the Tribunal to infer that these pumps were not in the dire condition that Ecuador alleges.\n\nLuna WS4, Annex 78. The Tribunal notes that this annex appears to refer to only one pump. Yet, it remains that Ecuador claims USD 32,662.45 on this head of claim (the Reply in paragraph 513 mentions USD 33,662.45, which the Tribunal understands to be due to a typographical error).\n\n1045.\n\nAs for the two overhauled pumps in Coca CPF, while it is true that Ecuador has submitted an inspection report showing that the pumps suffered from a number of problems, this report is dated September 2012, over three years after Petroamazonas took over the Blocks.2116 It is consequently of little value to assess the state of the pumps in July 2009. Burlington, by contrast, has submitted environmental audits that were sent to the Ministry of Energy and Mines from 2003 to 2006, showing the pump maintenance program in place during its operation of the Blocks, which included overhauls every 300 hours.2117 Moreover, the Claimant presented a summary of the maintenance accounts of Block 7, where Coca CPF is located, from 2003 to 2009, which shows that USD 2,500,139.25 were spent on \"Pump Maintenance\".2118 Finally, the Tribunal notes in addition that the SGS Reports contain no references to pumps in bad condition at the Coca field.\n\nLuna WS4, Annex 79.\n\nLetter of 31 January 2003 from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to Vincente Juepa (Ministry of Energy and Mines) (**Exh. CE-CC-213**), specific references to the Coca CPF pumps can be found at pp. 2930, 67 and 112.\n\nConsortium Block 7 and Block 21, Summary of Maintenance Accounts for Block 7 from 20032009 (**Exh. CE-CC-190**).\n\n1046.\n\nThis claim is consequently dismissed.\n\n**2.6.2 Electrical systems**\n----------------------------\n\n**a. Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n1047.\n\nAs regards the electrical systems, Ecuador submits that the Consortium did not comply with the relevant standards applicable in the petroleum industry, such as those contained in the National Electrical Code. Specifically, Ecuador argues that the Consortium (i) used technologically obsolete equipment, such as variators and switchgear boards that caused problems in the operation of the Blocks, and (ii) had inadequate electrical fittings. Ecuador quantifies its damages for this claim at USD 2,120,254, the cost of the new variators.2119\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 416; Luna WS2, \u00b6 29; Invoice for acquisition of 23 frequency variators (**Exh. E-** **308**).\n\n**b. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1048.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Ecuador's replacement of 23 variators and other improvements to the electrical facilities were not directed to repair substandard infrastructure, but to support Ecuador's expansion plan. Burlington argues that \"the variators could not have been obsolete, as even spare parts were still available from the supplier at the time of the expropriation and continue as of June 2013 to be available\".2120 By contrast, Burlington points to two documents (Luna Annex 13 and Exhibit CE-CC-280) which suggest that Ecuador incurred these costs to improve its profitability.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 418.\n\n**c. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1049.\n\nWhile Ecuador criticizes the Consortium's upkeep of electrical equipment and fittings in general, its claim is limited to the purchase of 23 variators for Block 7 for a price of USD 2,120,254.2121 However, the memorandum submitted as Luna Annex 13 does not show that the purchase was necessary as a consequence of the bad state of the existing equipment. To the contrary, it states that \"technical and financial advantages\" underlie a decision to migrate to a different model of variator:\n\n\"There are technical and financial advantages that justify the migration from the ICS model to the GCS model. *It is for this reason* that the replacement of 23 of the 26 frequency variators of block 7 has been planned [\u2026]\".2122\n\nThis is the amount claimed by Ecuador. The Tribunal notes however that neither of the documents cited by Ecuador in support of this claim exactly matches this figure. Luna Annex 13 refers to a cost of USD 2,120,262, while Exh. E-308 contains an invoice for the purchase of 23 generators for a total of USD 2,374,684.48.\n\nLuna WS2, Annex 13 (Translation and emphasis by the Tribunal).\n\n1050.\n\nIn addition, Exhibit CE-CC-280, entitled \"Repowering the Electrical System in Station Coca B-7\" refers to the \"repotentiation\" (in the original Spanish: *repotenciaci\u00f3n*) of the electrical system in Block 7 through a project (in fact, the second phase of a project) whose scope is defined as \"Development of Basic and Detailed Engineering for the Improvement of Electrical Facilities and Control of the Coca Station\". The very first sentence of that document explains that the repowering was necessary \"[d]ue to increased production\".\n\n1051.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal dismisses the claim for lack of proof that the expenses related to the purchase of the new variators were caused by the Claimant's improper maintenance, or by a bad condition beyond normal wear of the electrical systems of the Blocks in July 2009.\n\n**2.6.3 IT equipment and software**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a. Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n1052.\n\nEcuador alleges that the Consortium did not have a proper maintenance software in accordance with industry standards. As a result, after the takeover, Petroamazonas incurred costs in order to upgrade the technology used in its offices and implement \"Maximo\", a new Computered Maintenance Management System (CMMS).2123 Mr. Luna highlights that Petroamazonas had to implement the system from scratch, because the Consortium did not transfer the information from its SAP system or other maintenance archives when Petroamazonas took over the Blocks.2124\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 406.\n\nLuna WS3, \u00b6 171.\n\n1053.\n\nEcuador now seeks to recover these costs, which Mr. Luna quantifies at USD 151,601.96, including the purchase of computers, cameras, and the cost of hiring specialized personnel to implement the system.2125 Excluding the purchase of computers, Ecuador quantifies this claim at USD 81,384.96.2126\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 10-14 and Annex 18; Luna WS4, \u00b6 172.\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 418.\n\n1054.\n\nEcuador also separately claims for the additional costs of purchasing (additional) new software and computers.2127 Ecuador includes this in a global claim for other equipment,2128 but has clarified that its total claim for new software and computers (including Maximo) amounts to USD 470,565.01.2129 The Tribunal thus understands that its claim for additional computers and software (other than Maximo) amounts to USD 389,180.05 (USD 470,565.01- USD 81,384.96).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 417.\n\nOtros gastos de reacondicionamiento de los Bloques, amended version (**Exh. E-301**).\n\nEcuador's Opening Statement, Slide 137.\n\n**b. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1055.\n\nFor Burlington, the claim related to the Maximo software is another illustration of Ecuador seeking payment for upgrades. Burlington contends that the Consortium owned the software management program known as SAP, which complied with industry standards and was programmed with the information on the Block's infrastructure. Burlington thus argues that, even if Ecuador had chosen to switch from SAP to Maximo, it could have done so at a minimal cost by transferring the data contained in the SAP database to the Maximo database.2130 However, Ecuador chose not to participate in technical meetings with the Consortium to facilitate the transfer of data. As a result, it is solely responsible for any associated costs.2131\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 635, relying on: Intertek ER1, \u00b6 50.\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 635; Rejoinder, \u00b6 422.\n\n1056.\n\nBurlington further argues that an upgrade in technology does not require new or special computers.2132\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 634.\n\n**c. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1057.\n\nWith respect to Ecuador's claim for the implementation of the Maximo CMMS, the Tribunal notes that the Consortium had another management software in place (the SAP system), which Dr. Egan characterizes as a \"comprehensive\" and \"internationally recognized management system\" complying with industry standards.2133 Dr. Egan explains that:\n\n\"The Consortium's SAP program was populated with maintenance information relevant to the Block 7 and Block 21 infrastructure. Based upon the maintenance information entered, the SAP program alerted the Consortium when additional maintenance was needed, according to predetermined time intervals. Once the maintenance was completed, the SAP program generated a work order to document that the required maintenance was complete\".2134\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 49.\n\n1058.\n\nMr. Luna does not dispute these statements, but rather argues that, because the Consortium did not leave its SAP database when it left the Blocks, Petroamazonas had to program the Maximo system from scratch.2135 However, as Burlington has pointed out, after the takeover, the Consortium wrote to Petroamazonas to, *inter alia*, \"propose a technical meeting to assure an orderly post-takeover transition [\u2026]\", but Petroamazonas did not reply.2136 While it is true that the Consortium's letter referred specifically to the transition of employees and contractors, this letter shows the Consortium's willingness to collaborate towards an adequate transition. As a result, the Tribunal finds that Ecuador must bear its costs of implementing a new CMMS.\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 172.\n\nLetter from Rub\u00e9n Vintimilla (Perenco) to Wilson P\u00e1stor M. (Petroamazonas), 23 July 2009, p. 4 (**Exh. CE-CC-221**).\n\n1059.\n\nAs to Ecuador's claim for new computers, other than Mr. Luna's assertions that the Consortium did not have sufficient computers to implement the Maximo system2137 and Ecuador's allegation that Petroamazonas thus had to purchase new computers,2138 Ecuador has not advanced any evidence that the IT equipment and computer software were in need of replacement. Indeed, Ecuador itself characterizes these expenses as an upgrade, rather than a repair.2139 In addition, both SGS Reports consider most of the computers and software examined to be in \"good\" or \"very good condition\".2140\n\nLuna WS4, \u00b6 172 *.*\n\n2nd SMCC, \u00b6 417.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 405 (referring to expenses incurred for, inter alia, \"upgrading the technology used in the offices with new software and computers\").\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, Inventory Report, 2009 (**Exh.

CE-CC-240**).\n\n1060.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal dismisses this claim for lack of sufficient evidence that these expenses were caused by Burlington's negligence.\n\n**2.6.4 Road maintenance and vehicles**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n1061.\n\nEcuador seeks to recover the amounts which it has spent in the purchase of new vehicles (USD 98,187.16) and road maintenance (USD 381,127.64).2141\n\nOtros gastos de reacondicionamiento de los Bloques, amended version (**Exh. E-301**).\n\n1062.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, contemporaneous evidence shows that the Consortium's vehicles had exceeded their useful life. Ecuador alleges in particular that in March 2008, 72% of the vehicles were more than 10 years old and 51% had run over 250,000 kilometers. For this reason, Ecuador argues that it is entitled to be reimbursed for the costs of the replacement vehicles it acquired.2142\n\nReply, \u00b6 532(a).\n\n1063.\n\nEcuador also contends that the Consortium did not invest sufficiently in road maintenance, as proved by the discrepancy between Petroamazonas' and the Consortium's spending. According to Ecuador, in 2010 Petroamazonas spent USD 4,264,318.05 on road maintenance, while the Consortium only spent USD 435,051 in 2008.2143 Ecuador emphasizes that it only seeks road maintenance costs which it incurred on account of the Consortium's lack of past maintenance during its operatorship of Blocks 7 and 21.2144\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 532(c).\n\n*Ibid.*, referring to: Luna WS4, Annex 36.\n\n**b. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1064.\n\nBurlington opposes the claims concerning road maintenance and new vehicles on the ground that Petroamazonas attempts to charge the Consortium for regular maintenance and for improvements necessary for its expanded operations and growing workforce on the Blocks.2145\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 634; Rejoinder, \u00b6 413.\n\n1065.\n\nRelying on Dr. Egan, Burlington argues that its obligation was limited to maintaining the roads that provided access to the pads and that Ecuador has not shown evidence of a lack of maintenance in any of these roads.2146 In addition, Dr. Egan notes that the total amount invested in road maintenance on the Blocks from 2006 to 2009 was an average of USD 649,595 per year. While Dr. Egan recognizes that \"it is difficult to interpret the trends (the need for road maintenance may be affected by weather causing wash outs for example)\", he concludes that \"it is clear that the Consortium invested substantially in road maintenance through its operating period\".2147 Burlington also notes that the annual expenses allegedly incurred by Petroamazonas cover its total spending on the 6 blocks which it operates. Adjusted for two blocks the figure is comparable to that of the Consortium.2148\n\nIntertek ER1, \u00b6 140.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 141.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 413.\n\n1066.\n\nBurlington also denies that the vehicles left by the Consortium had exceeded their useful life and argues that it was therefore unnecessary to buy new vehicles. According to Burlington, Ecuador's purchase of four new vehicles corresponds to an upgrade in view of Petroamazonas' growing workforce.2149\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 634; Rejoinder, \u00b6 420\n\n**2.6.5 Discussion**\n--------------------\n\n1067.\n\nWith respect to Ecuador's claim for new vehicles, the Tribunal notes that, according to \"the National Transit Commission of Ecuador, the useful life of a double cabin truck is 15 years, and the larger vehicles such as tractors and trucks have a useful life of 32 years\".2150 The Tribunal also notes that Ecuador has put forward no documentary evidence supporting the need to repair or replace specific vehicles. That being said, the SGS reports identify at least two vehicles (both of them Toyota Landcruisers) that are either in \"very bad\" or \"good\" but damaged condition.2151 Since Ecuador is claiming the cost of purchasing four similar vehicles for a total of USD 98,187.162152 and Burlington has not challenged this amount as such, the Tribunal grants Ecuador half of this claim, i.e. USD 49,093.58.\n\nIntertek ER2, \u00b6 175.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, Inventory Report, 2009, Line 247, Depreciable B-7 (**Exh.

CE-CC-240**).\n\nOtros gastos de reacondicionamiento de los Bloques, amended version (**Exh. E-301**).\n\n1068.\n\nIn respect of roads, Ecuador claims that the amounts spent on road maintenance were due to a lack of past maintenance by Burlington without pointing to any supporting evidence. No mention of the allegedly bad state of the roads is found in either SGS Report, and while the 2008 Environmental Audit refers to a lack of signposting, this can hardly be considered sufficient to support Ecuador's claims.2153 Therefore, the claim regarding road maintenance expenditures is dismissed for lack of proof that these expenses were caused by Burlington's negligence.\n\nBlock 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008 (**Exh. CE-CC-182**).\n\n**2.7 Other claims**\n--------------------\n\n1069.\n\nEcuador also seeks compensation for other repairs and the upgrade of facilities and purchase of back up equipment, spare parts and materials to bring the Blocks' operations in line with industry standards. These works include the reconditioning of wells, the refurbishment of camps and a new communications tower in Gacela CPF.\n\n1070.\n\nBurlington contends that these claims should be dismissed, because it maintained and returned the Blocks' infrastructure in good condition and in accordance with industry standards. For the Claimant, Ecuador's refurbishment works and any increase in the maintenance budget are attributable to its expansion of the Blocks and the resulting rise in production levels, and are unrelated to Burlington's operation of the Blocks.\n\n1071.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that these claims have not been sufficiently particularized or proven \u2013 in certain cases they were not even pleaded \u2013 by the Respondent. As an example, Ecuador claims USD 122,540.77 to build a new communications tower in Gacela CPF. However, there is no reference to this item in the Respondent's submissions. The only mentions of this tower which the Tribunal has been able to identify are in Exhibit E-301 and slide 137 of Ecuador's Opening Statement on Counterclaims. Yet, these provide no explanation for the claim nor any indication that the construction of the tower was necessary due to the Consortium's conduct. This is but one example to illustrate that these claims are insufficiently established.\n\n1072.\n\nMoreover, as noted above, the Tribunal has found that the infrastructure on the Blocks was generally in proper condition, and that the Respondent's expansion plans and increases in production were bound to require (and in certain cases have in fact been shown to be the cause of) improvements to the existing equipment and facilities.\n\n1073.\n\nFor all these grounds, these further claims are thus dismissed.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n1074.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides to grant a total of **USD 2,577,119.77** in respect of Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims, itemized as follows:\n\ni. USD 503,572.76 for the Gacela T-104 and Payamino T-102 tanks, as well as minor repairs to pipelines;\n\nii. USD 1,462,553.43 for repairs related to pipelines and fluid lines;\n\niii. USD 561,900.00 for Block 7 engines; and\n\niv. USD 49,093.58 for new vehicles.\n\n**D. Conclusion On Counterclaims**\n----------------------------------\n\n1075.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal decides to grant a total of **USD 41,776,492.77** in respect of Ecuador's counterclaims, comprising:\n\ni. USD 39,199,373 for the environmental counterclaims (see paragraph 889 above); and\n\nii. USD 2,577,119.77 for the infrastructure counterclaims (see paragraph 1074 above).\n\n1076.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes Burlington's request for relief raised in its PostHearing Brief seeking a declaration that \"beyond the exceedances assessed by the Tribunal, Burlington has no further liability for environmental harm in Blocks 7 and 21\".2154 The declaration sought is in line with the agreement of 26 May 2011 by which the Parties submitted the counterclaims to this Tribunal.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 277(c). Burlington's earlier memorials do not contain a request of the same content. Its Rejoinder seeks an indemnification from third party claims, a request not later repeated and distinct from the one discussed here. See: Rejoinder, \u00b6 426(b).\n\n1077.\n\nWhereas Clause 9 of such agreement records that this arbitration is \"the appropriate forum for the final resolution of the Counterclaims arising out of investments made by Burlington Resources and its affiliates in Blocks 7 and 21, so as to ensure maximum judicial economy and consistency\", Clause 1(b) extends the binding force and *res judicata* effects of the present decision as follows:\n\n\"The decision of the Arbitral Tribunal constituted in the Arbitration on the Counterclaims shall be final and binding on the Parties and have full ***res judicata*** effect with respect to: (i) Burlington Resources and Ecuador (including its emanations, agencies, instrumentalities, subdivisions and controlled corporations including, without limitation, Petroecuador); and (ii) all affiliates of Burlington Resources, Burlington Oriente and Burlington Resources International, including ConocoPhillips and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the ***ConocoPhillips Group***) as if such claims had been brought and resolved against them\".2155\n\nAgreement between Burlington, Burlington Resources Oriente Limited and Burlington Resources International and Ecuador, 26 May 2011 (**Exh. E-251**) (emphasis in the original).\n\n1078.\n\nClause 1(c) then provides for a waiver by Ecuador of further actions in the following terms:\n\n\"Ecuador (including its emanations, agencies, instrumentalities, subdivisions and controlled corporations including, without limitation, Petroecuador) formally waives its right to bring the Counterclaims, including, but not limited to any claims based on alleged environmental liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21 (including under the Block 7 PSC and Block 21 PSC) against Burlington Resources, Burlington Oriente and any other corporation in the ConocoPhillips Group, before any jurisdiction whatsoever whether arbitral or judicial, national or international except for this Arbitration\".2156\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n1079.\n\nIn view of this waiver, the Tribunal considers that a ruling is not necessary. It takes formal notice, however, of the content of the agreement of 26 May 2011, especially of the waiver which it contains, as recorded above.\n\n1080.\n\nAs a final matter, the Tribunal must address the issue of double recovery. As mentioned in paragraph 70 above, Burlington has called the Tribunal's attention to the potential risk of double recovery in respect of the Respondent's counterclaims since Ecuador \"made a full claim for the alleged environmental harm in each of the Burlington and Perenco cases\".2157 Burlington requests that the Tribunal address the \"potentially pernicious consequences\" deriving from that risk so that \"if the dispositive part of either of the awards on counterclaims provides for any compensation, Ecuador would be prevented from enforcing the second award to the extent that it has already been compensated by the first\".2158\n\nLetter of 18 September 2015 from Burlington to the Tribunal, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid.* ; CMCC, \u00b6 643.\n\n1081.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties on the issue of double recovery. More specifically, first, there is no question that Ecuador claims compensation for the same damages in these and in the parallel *Perenco* proceedings. For Burlington, Ecuador is \"twice seeking 100% recovery of precisely the same alleged damages, for precisely the same alleged injury, on precisely the same legal and factual bases\".2159 Ecuador, for its part, does not deny that it seeks compensation for the same harm in both cases, although it distinguishes the two arbitrations in various ways, stating for instance that the arguments or the evidence in both cases are not \"exactly the same\".2160 Ecuador actually relies on the joint and several liability of the Consortium partners to justify its claim against Burlington, although only Perenco operated the Blocks.2161\n\nCMCC, \u00b6 643. See also: Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 155:17-22 (Opening, Blackaby).\n\nSee, for instance: Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2357:13-20 (Tribunal, Silva Romero).\n\nFor instance, Ecuador stated that: \"Pursuant to Ecuadorian law, all the authors of a tort (such as environmental harm) are jointly liable to its victim. Accordingly, Ecuador is entitled to claim for the total amount of damages from Burlington or Perenco or any other author of the environmental harm caused, including CEPE and Petroproduccion, which are entities different from the Ecuadorian state\". Reply, \u00b6 8. See also: R-PHB, \u00b6 603.\n\n1082.\n\nSecond, it is also common ground that claiming compensation for the same damage in parallel proceedings creates a risk of double recovery.2162 In this context, Ecuador submits that whichever tribunal issues the later award on Ecuador's counterclaims can readily address this risk and thus Burlington's fear of \"pernicious consequences\" is misplaced:2163\n\n\"Ecuador [\u2026] adds that its counterclaims will not result in \u2018 *pernicious consequences*.' If Claimant alludes to the issue of double recovery, the prohibition thereof exclusively applies when a party has already been indemnified by a third party. In addition, Claimant cannot pretend to ignore that any second award in the present cases against the Consortium members \u2018 *could be fashioned in such a way as to prevent double recovery*.' International law, Ecuadorian law and international decisions offer numerous mechanisms for preventing double recovery, including by taking into account the monetary relief granted by any prior award\".2164\n\nLetter of 18 September 2015 from Burlington to the Tribunal, p. 2.\n\nReply, \u00b6 545.\n\nEmphasis in the original and citations omitted. Reply, \u00b6 547.\n\n1083.\n\nThird, there is common ground between the Parties that a creditor can only be compensated once for a given harm, and rightly so, as a number of arbitral tribunals have acknowledged that the \"prohibition of double recovery for the same loss is a well-established principle\".2165\n\n*Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award of 9 October 2014, \u00b6 378. See also: *Pan American Energy LLC and BP Argentina Exploration Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13 and *BP America Production Company and others v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/8, Decision on Preliminary Objections of 27 July 2006, \u00b6 219; among others: *Bayindir Insaat Turzim Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.\u00a7. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 November 2005, \u00b6 270; *Daimler Financial Services AG v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award of 22 August 2012, \u00b6 155.\n\n1084.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal takes note that, prior to the end of the Hearing on counterclaims, counsel for Ecuador clearly stated that Ecuador does not seek double recovery in its claims against the Consortium members:\n\n\"The second comment I am specifically instructed to make today is that we don't want the Burlington Tribunal to have any concern regarding double recovery. This is not what Ecuador is looking for\".2166\n\nTr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2358:14-18 (Tribunal, Silva Romero).\n\n1085.\n\nThe Tribunal takes due notice of Ecuador's representations, which are in line with the general principle prohibiting double recovery.\n\n1086.\n\nAs of the date of the present Decision, the *Perenco* tribunal has issued no decision yet on the counterclaims before it. Therefore, this Tribunal lacks the necessary information or basis to adopt any specific measures \u2013 to *fashion its decision*, to borrow Ecuador's phrase \u2013 to prevent double recovery, a task that it must leave to the *Perenco* tribunal as the one deciding in second place. This being said, this Tribunal nonetheless states that, as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage.\n\n**VI. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n**A. Parties' Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n1087.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief quoted in paragraph 0 above, Ecuador claims interest on all sums awarded at an \"adequate commercial interest rate\" from the date of the Award. In addition, on sums awarded based on the infrastructure counterclaims, it also requests pre-award interest, to run from the \"date of disbursement\" of the amounts for which damages are awarded. While in earlier submissions on the counterclaims, the Respondent sought compound interest,2167 the requests for relief in the Post-Hearing Brief contain no indication whether simple or compound interest is sought. Nor does Ecuador provide any arguments on the entitlement and computation of interest in connection with the counterclaims, unlike in the context of Burlington's claims. That said, in its submissions on Burlington's claims Ecuador has clarified that it seeks simple interest for both claims and counterclaims.2168\n\nCM Liability, \u00b6 813; SMCC, \u00b6\u00b6 339 and 341; 2nd SMCC; \u00b6\u00b6 425 and 427; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 541 and 543.\n\nMotion for Reconsideration and Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 563.\n\n1088.\n\nBurlington opposes Ecuador's claims on the merits, but does not take issue with the request for interest as such. For itself, it claims interest on costs and expenses involved in the context of the counterclaims at a rate of 4 percent p.a. compounded annually or any other rate and compounding period that the Tribunal may consider \"just and appropriate\".2169\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 277; quoted in paragraph 0 above.\n\n1089.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, in its costs submission, Ecuador claimed simple interest at an adequate commercial rate, which it equated to a \"reasonable commercial rate\" and specified as LIBOR plus two percent.2170 Burlington claimed interest on costs upon the same terms as those set out in the preceding paragraph.\n\nR-Cost submission, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13, 15 and 29.\n\n**B. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1090.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that amounts due and paid late must earn interest. It is equally undisputed that interest must accrue at a reasonable commercial rate. For reasons further explained in the Award and because this solution is in line with both Parties' requests, the Tribunal sets such rate at LIBOR for three month borrowings plus two percent.2171\n\nSee: Section VII.D (5.3.3) of the Award.\n\n1091.\n\nThere is no controversy either that interest on sums awarded for Ecuador's counterclaims must run from the date of this Decision. As an exception, in connection with the infrastructure claims, Ecuador claims interest from the \"date of disbursement\" of the amounts expended to remediate the poor condition of the infrastructure. Burlington does not appear to have expressed a view on this claim for pre-award interest. This said, Ecuador has not indicated the relevant \"dates of disbursement\" that the Tribunal is asked to take into consideration. As a result, the Tribunal cannot but consider that these dates are insufficiently established and, therefore, sets the *dies a quo* of the interest on the date of this Decision.\n\n1092.\n\nThere remains the question whether interest should be simple or compound. While Ecuador has argued for simple interest in the context of Burlington's claims, in its submissions on counterclaims it has first sought compound interest and then remained silent (save in relation to costs, which will be addressed in the Award).\n\n1093.\n\nIn its submissions in respect of Burlington's claims, Ecuador has argued that Ecuadorian law prohibits compound interest,2172 and has clarified that, in accordance with Ecuadorian law, it is limiting its claim for interest on the amounts sought under its counterclaims to simple interest.2173 The Tribunal has rejected this argument in respect of interest accruing on the claims because these are subject to international law.2174 Ecuador's counterclaims, however, are governed by Ecuadorian law. Burlington objects to the application of Ecuadorian law to interest awarded on its claims, but is silent with respect to the law governing interest on the counterclaims.2175\n\nMotion for Reconsideration and Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 562, citing: Article 308 of the Constitution, Articles 1575 and 2113 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, and Article 561 of the Ecuadorian Commercial code.\n\nMotion for Reconsideration and Counter-Memorial on Quantum, \u00b6 563.\n\nSee: Section VII.D (5.3.3) of the Award.\n\nBurlington declines to comment on whether Ecuadorian law prohibits compounding, arguing that \"[e]ven if true (which must at least be questionable given Ecuador's prior pleadings), the treatment of interest under domestic Ecuadorian law is irrelevant\" in the context of Burlington's international law claims. See Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 244.\n\n1094.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as a general rule, Ecuadorian law prohibits compounding. Pursuant to Article 2113 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, \"[i]t is forbidden to stipulate interest on interest\".2176 That being said, the Ecuadorian Commercial Code exceptionally appears to allow compounding in certain cases, as follows:\n\n\"In commercial loans or other kinds of commercial debt, no returns are owed over accrued returns, but from, once they are settled, the moment in which they are included in a new contract as an increase in the principal, or from the moment when, pursuant to a mutual agreement, or by a judicial declaration, outstanding accounts are settled; settlement that must include the returns accrued up to that moment, and which cannot take place but when the obligations the returns derive from are due and payable in cash\".2177\n\nArticle 2113 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (Translation by Ecuador) (**Exh. EL-182**).\n\nArticle 561 of the Ecuadorian Commercial Code (Translation by Ecuador) (**Exh. EL-296**).\n\n1095.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not sufficiently clear whether the interest to be awarded in this Decision falls under the exception provided in Article 561 of the Ecuadorian Commercial Code. The Tribunal thus defers to Ecuador's interpretation of its own law, according to which compound interest is prohibited, and to its request for relief, which seeks simple interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal will award simple interest on Ecuador's counterclaims.\n\n1096.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that it will deal with the matter of interest on the Parties' costs claims in the context of its review of costs in the Award.\n\n1097.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal deems it just and appropriate to award simple interest at LIBOR for three month borrowings plus two percent, from the date of this Decision until payment in full.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n1098.\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with the costs of this arbitration in one decision including interest on costs, to be included in the Award.\n\n**VIII. OPERATIVE PART**\n------------------------\n\n1099.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\nA. Declares\n\n1. That Burlington is liable towards Ecuador for the costs of restoring the environment in areas within Blocks 7 and 21 in the amount specified in paragraph B(1) below;\n\n2.

THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\nA. **The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Burlington Resources Inc. (\"Burlington\" or the \"Claimant\"), a corporation created under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, in 1988 and active in the exploitation of natural resources. On 31 March 2006, Burlington was acquired by ConocoPhillips, a multinational energy company with headquarters in the State of Texas, United States of America.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this phase of the proceedings by Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Elliot Friedman, Mr. Carlos Ramos-Mrosovsky, Mr. Leon Skornicki, and Ms. Bonnie Doyle of the law firm FRESHFIELDS BRUCKHAUS DERINGER US LLP; by Mr. Craig Miles, Mr. Wade Coriell, Ms. Elizabeth M. Silbert, Ms. Jamie Miller, and Ms. Kate E. Hill of the law firm KING & SPALDING LLP; by Mr. Jan Paulsson of the law firm THREE CROWNS LLP; and by Mr. Javier Robalino of the law firm FERRERE (ECUADOR).\n\nB. **The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador (\"Ecuador\" or \"Respondent\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Dr. Diego Garda Carrion, Procurador General del Estado, Dra. Blanca Gomez de la Torre, Directora de Asuntos Internacionales y Arbitraje, Dr. Christel Gaibor and Dr. Diana Moya from the PROCURADURIA GENERAL DEL ESTADO, REP\u00dbBLICA DEL ECUADOR; by Prof. Eduardo Silva Romero, Mr. Philip Dunham, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garda Represa, Mr. Alvaro Galindo, Ms. Erica Stein, Ms. Maria Claudia Procopiak, and Ms. Audrey Caminades of the law firm DECHERT (Paris) LLP; and by Professor Pierre Mayer who left DECHERT (Paris) LLP on 1 June 2015.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\nA. **Decisions on Jurisdiction and Liability**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 June 2010, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, informing the Parties that it would take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings towards the merits phase.\n\n6.\n\nOn 14 December 2012, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Liability and informed the Parties that it would take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings towards the quantum phase.\n\n7.\n\nThe Decisions on Jurisdiction and Liability are made an integral part of this Award.\n\nB. **Decision on Counterclaims**\n--------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nIn the course of this arbitration, on 17 January 2011, Ecuador raised counterclaims seeking compensation for damage to the environment and to the infrastructure of the oilfields allegedly caused by the Consortium. The Parties later entered into an agreement conferring jurisdiction over the counterclaims to this Tribunal, as recounted in Procedural Order No. 8 dated 21 July 2011 (Procedural Orders are referred to herein as \"PO\" followed by their respective numbers).1\n\nThe POs not referred to here, for instance, POs No. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 30, 31, dealt with another aspect of these proceedings, for instance with the counterclaims.\n\n9.\n\nThe proceedings on the counterclaims gave rise to a Decision on Counterclaims issued shortly before this Award. The Decision on Counterclaims is made an integral part of this Award.\n\n**C. Written Phase on Quantum**\n-------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn 28 January 2013, Ecuador sought leave to submit (i) additional document requests and (ii) a motion for reconsideration of the Decision on Liability. Ecuador further requested the Tribunal to suspend the quantum proceedings or, in the alternative, organize parallel proceedings, set out a briefing schedule and reserve a 2-3 day hearing on the motion for reconsideration. In its letters of 1 and 5 February 2013, Burlington responded that it did not object to additional document production requests, nor did it contest the right of either Party to request reconsideration or clarification, but it did object to the suspension of the quantum proceedings requested by Respondent.\n\n11.\n\nOn 22 March 2013, the Tribunal set a document production schedule allowing the Parties to make requests before the first round of quantum briefs. In PO11, the Tribunal authorized Ecuador to file a motion for reconsideration, but denied the suspension of the quantum proceedings or the holding of parallel proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nOn 30 April 2013, the Tribunal issued PO12 addressing Burlington's quantum-related document requests.\n\n13.\n\nOn 24 June 2013, Burlington filed its Memorial on Quantum.\n\n14.\n\nOn 24 July 2013, Ecuador proposed the disqualification of Professor Orrego Vicuna, following which the Centre informed the Parties on 25 July 2013 that the proceedings were suspended pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"). On 13 December 2013, the Centre issued its decision disqualifying Professor Orrego Vicuna. On 11 January 2014, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceedings resumed upon Mr. Stephen Drymer's acceptance of his appointment as arbitrator in replacement of Professor Orrego Vicuna.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 January 2014, the Parties agreed to a revised calendar setting out the procedural steps for the counterclaims as well as the quantum proceedings. On 10 February 2014, the Tribunal issued PO15 addressing Ecuador's quantum-related document requests.\n\n16.\n\nIn PO18, issued on 22 April 2014, the Tribunal addressed Ecuador's renewed request seeking a decision from the Tribunal ordering Burlington to comply with PO15.\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 May 2014, Ecuador filed its Counter-Memorial on Quantum together with a Motion for Reconsideration. In addition, Ecuador made a renewed attempt to bifurcate its motion for reconsideration, to suspend the quantum proceedings, or alternatively, to organize parallel proceedings allowing the Tribunal to rule on the motion for reconsideration as a matter of urgency. On 7 July 2014, the Tribunal issued PO22 denying Ecuador's request to bifurcate the motion for reconsideration from the proceedings on quantum.\n\n18.\n\nOn 9 August 2014, the Tribunal issued PO23, addressing Burlington's request for updated documents.\n\n19.\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Burlington filed its Reply on Quantum and Counter-Memorial on Reconsideration.\n\n20.\n\nIn PO24 issued on 22 December 2014 the Tribunal ruled on Burlington's request for quantum-related documents and in PO25 issued on 23 December 2014, the Tribunal resolved Ecuador's quantum-related document requests.\n\n21.\n\nThereafter, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder on Quantum and Motion for Reconsideration on 12 January 2015.\n\n22.\n\nOn 20 January 2015, the Tribunal and the Parties held a telephone conference to discuss procedural aspects relating to the organization of the hearing on quantum and Ecuador's motion for reconsideration.\n\n23.\n\nOn 29 January 2015, the Tribunal issued PO26 setting out the organizational aspects of the upcoming hearing.\n\n24.\n\nOn 11 February 2015, the Tribunal issued PO27 deciding Burlington's request to introduce new evidence into the record, and on 18 February 2015, in PO28, the Tribunal resolved Ecuador's request to introduce additional evidence.\n\n25.\n\nOn the same day, 18 February 2015, Burlington filed a supplemental witness statement of Mr. Crick.\n\nD. **Hearing on Quantum**\n-------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe hearing on quantum and on Ecuador's motion for reconsideration took place from 2 to 6 March 2015 in Paris (the \"Hearing\").

Burlington further presented the following experts: Mr. Manuel Abdala (Compass Lexecon), Mr. Pablo Lopez Zadicoff (Compass Lexecon), Mr. Mark S. Sheiness (Compass Lexecon), Dr. Geoffrey Egan (Papanui Resources), Mr. Christopher P.

Post Hearing Phase**\n-------------------------\n\n31.\n\nOn 29 May 2015, the Parties simultaneously filed their Post-Hearing Briefs (\"PHBs\").\n\n32.\n\nThe Parties simultaneously filed their cost submissions on 2 May 2016, and their reply submissions on 23 May 2016.\n\n33.\n\nAt the Tribunal's request (as discussed and agreed with the Parties and their experts prior to the close of the Hearing), in accordance with PO29 dated 13 March 2015, on 24 April 2015 the Parties' experts submitted a joint valuation model allowing for the calculation of potential damages according to the DCF methodology under different assumptions and scenarios (the \"Model\"). The Tribunal understands that, to the extent that each Party's assumptions are applied as described in each expert's individual report, the result of the joint model replaces the experts' previous damages figures. This is particularly relevant for valuations using the date of the award or valuations of interest, which vary with time.\n\n34.\n\nOn 27 July 2016, the Tribunal invited the experts to update the Model, providing additional assumptions and specifications (the \"Updated Model\"). The experts did so on 20 September 2016 and the Parties commented on the Updated Model on 4 October 2016.\n\n35.\n\nOn several occasions after the PHBs, specifically on 25 February 2016, 27 July 2016, and 29 November 2016, the Tribunal reported to the Parties on the progress of its deliberations.\n\n36.\n\nOn 25 January 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed.\n\n**III.

Should the Arbitral Tribunal nonetheless be inclined to award compensation to Burlington, Ecuador respectfully requests that it be calculated in accordance with this submission and, in any event, that any such compensation be substantially reduced on account of Burlington's behavior leading to its loss.\n\n606. Finally, Ecuador respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(a) Order Burlington to pay all the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Ecuador's legal and expert fees and ICSID's other costs, with interest at an adequate commercial interest rate; and\n\n(b) Award such other relief as the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate\".\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 603-606.\n\n41.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Ecuador submitted the following Request for Relief:6\n\n\"964.

SCOPE OF THIS AWARD**\n---------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThis Award deals with and resolves Ecuador's motion to reconsider the Decision on Liability, with the quantum of Burlington's claims further to the Decision on Liability, and with the costs of the entire arbitration, including the proceedings on Burlington's claims (jurisdiction, liability and quantum phases) and Ecuador's counterclaims. As stated above, the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Decision on Liability and the Decision on Counterclaims are also made integral parts of this Award.\n\n**V. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A.** **Law Applicable to the Merits**\n---------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to paragraphs 177 to 179 of the Decision on Liability. There, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that it would apply (i) first and foremost the BIT and, if need be, (ii) Ecuadorian law and those rules of international law \"as may be applicable\". In this latter respect, the Tribunal further stated that it was of the view that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is thus for the arbitrators to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law, it being understood that a party may not rely on its internal law to avoid an obligation under international law.\n\n**B.** **Undisputed Matters**\n-----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nWhen applying the law (whether national or international), be it in this Award or in earlier decisions, the Tribunal is of the view that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle *iura novit curia* \u2013 or better in this instance, *iura novit arbiter* \u2013 allows the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not rely on a legal theory that was not subject to debate or that the Parties could not anticipate or address.8\n\nSee, for instance: *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1 (\" *Daimler v. Argentina* \"), Decision on Annulment of 7 January 2015, \u00b6 295 (\"[\u2026] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to: or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties.

Relevance of Decisions of Other International Courts and Tribunals**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAs stated in the Decisions on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions of international tribunals.9 The majority considers, however, that, subject always to the specifics of a given treaty and to the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent similar cases, if such exist, absent compelling contrary grounds. Arbitrator Stern does not analyze the arbitrator's role in the same manner, as she considers it her duty to decide each case purely on its own merits as argued before her, independently of any apparent jurisprudential trend.\n\nDoJ, \u00b6 100; DoL, \u00b6 187.\n\n**D.** **Language of Decisions and Award**\n------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn accordance with Clause 7 of the Minutes of First Session, the Tribunal renders this Award, and has rendered its prior decisions, in both English and Spanish. This being so, it notes that English is the language in which this Award and the prior decisions were originally drafted. Hence, in the event of any discrepancy between the two versions, the English version must be deemed to reflect the meaning intended by the Tribunal, and such version shall thus prevail.\n\n**VI. ECUADOR'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIn its Motion for Reconsideration (the \"Motion\"), Ecuador requests that the Tribunal reconsider its Decision on Liability on the ground of two exceptional circumstances.\n\nA. **Parties' Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n49.\n\nEcuador requests that the Decision on Liability be reconsidered because it is \"fundamentally and fatally flawed\" with respect to the question whether there was an expropriation.10 Ecuador raises essentially two \"exceptional circumstances\", which, it says, justify reconsideration \"even though a finding for Ecuador on either count will suffice to reverse the unlawful expropriation holding\":11\n\n(i) the Tribunal based its decision on expropriation on a legal argument over Article 74(4) of the Hydrocarbons Law (the \"HL\") that neither Party had raised;12 and/or\n\n(ii) the Tribunal reached its decision without the full knowledge of the significant, real and immediate risks created by the suspension, Burlington having withheld key evidence in this regard.13\n\nLetter of 28 January 2013 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, pp. 1-5; CM, \u00b6 25; Rejoinder, \u00b6 30; R-PHB, \u00b6 13.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 30.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, the Decision on Liability is not an award, but a \"decision preliminary to an award\" which does not carry *res judicata* effects,14 as was recently confirmed by the tribunal in *Standard Chartered Bank (\"SCB\") v. Tanesco*.15 It is therefore capable of reconsideration in the Tribunal's discretion. Here, the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to reconsider as a result of the exceptional circumstances just referred to.16\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 46. See also: CM, \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (Tanesco)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20 (\" *SCB v.

Tanesco*, pp. 2-3.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n51.\n\nEcuador further argues that the Motion is admissible and that the Tribunal has the power to reconsider the Decision on Liability.17 In particular, it notes that Burlington expressly agreed that both Parties could seek reconsideration and thus cannot now object that the Motion is inadmissible.18 It further explains that \"powers of reconsideration\" exist in exceptional circumstances, such as those embodied in Articles 49(2), 51, 52 of the ICSID Convention, as well as ICSID Arbitration Rules 25 and 38(2).19 In any event, Ecuador submits that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention provides the Tribunal with the inherent power to reconsider prior decisions.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; R-Comments on *SCB v.

Tanesco* confirms that the Tribunal has the power to reopen and amend the Decision on Liability.20 Ecuador admits that such power is limited to exceptional circumstances,21 but it argues that it is not constrained by the requirements of Article 51 or Article 52 applied by analogy or by any other provision of the ICSID Convention.22 If, *par impossible*, the Tribunal were to hold that the Decision on Liability is *res judicata*, it could still reconsider the decision, under the higher standard of Article 51.23 In contrast to the *Perenco* tribunal, which merely examined whether any of the provisions invoked by Ecuador applied to the motion for reconsideration in that case, the Tribunal should focus on the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying reconsideration.24 According to the Respondent, exceptional circumstances exist if \"any of the grounds for reopening a Convention award or decision apply, or if it is otherwise in the interest of justice\".25\n\nR-Comments on *SCB v.

Ecuador also stresses that the tribunal in *SCB v. Tanesco* reconsidered its prior decision in circumstances similar to the present ones.27\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 38; R-Comments on *SCB v. Tanesco*, p. 3.\n\nR-Comments on *SCB v. Tanesco*, pp. 3-4.\n\n54.\n\nFirst, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal should reconsider its decision on expropriation and hold that Ecuador was entitled to intervene in the Blocks \"following the Consortium's suspension\".28 It essentially invokes five reasons in support of this submission:29 (i) the Tribunal, in breach of due process, reached its decision by engaging in an interpretation of Article 74 HL \"that neither party had raised in these proceedings\";30 (ii) Article 74(4) HL only relates to *caducidad*, not to suspension or intervention;31 (iii) Ecuador was entitled to intervene in the Blocks to ensure the continuity of hydrocarbon production as required under its Constitution, Ecuadorian law, and the PSCs;32 (iv) intervention is not a sanction, but a coercive measure aimed at protecting Ecuador's strategic assets in a situation of urgency, and Ecuador had inherent powers to substitute itself to a private oilfield contractor in default;33 and (v) provisions of Ecuadorian law provide for inherent powers of the State to fulfill its duty to minimize \"all negative impact on the hydrocarbon production\".34\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 41-65.

Instead, it should hold that the Consortium could not rely on that defense, since (i) Burlington admitted that \"the only reason\" why the Tribunal found just cause to suspend operations was that Ecuador had breached its contractual commitments, which is precisely an application of the *exceptio* ;35 (ii) the *exceptio* is inapplicable in the circumstances of the present case, as hydrocarbon operations are subject to the principle of continuity;36 (iii) there are no Ecuadorian cases allowing a contractor to raise the *exceptio* against the State;37 and (iv) Burlington should have sought the Tribunal's authorization to suspend operations.38\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 60.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 63.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 180; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. See also: Tr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1488:9-1489:8 (Closing, Silva Romero).\n\n56.\n\nSecond, Ecuador argues that the suspension of the oilfield operations created risks of damage so significant as to justify immediate intervention. According to Ecuador, the technical action plan of 3 June 2009 to suspend operations at Blocks 7 and 21 (in Ecuador's abbreviation, the \"Suspension Plan\" or, in Burlington's terminology, the \"Draft Action Plan\") which Burlington disclosed belatedly and the Tribunal thus did not have knowledge of when making the Decision on Liability is \"highly relevant evidence\".39 It demonstrates the existence of significant risks of reservoir,40 mechanical41 and environmental damage.42 It also shows that the Consortium was aware of these risks. The Decision on Liability was therefore premised on incomplete and misleading evidence.43 Contrary to Burlington's view, that document is not privileged since it addresses the technical risks of suspension.44\n\nCM, \u00b6 52.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 253-270.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 271-290.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 291-302.\n\nCM, Section 2.2.2.1, \u00b6\u00b6 94-123; R-Comments on *SCB v.

Accordingly, revision should be available when a fact is discovered which decisively affects a pre-award decision.46 Ecuador also argues that, since Burlington produced the Suspension Plan belatedly, the time limits set forth in Article 51 do not apply.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 96.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 34.\n\n58.\n\nIn addition, so says the Respondent, the Suspension Plan proves that the Consortium imprudently planned to abandon the Blocks, as it failed to engage in an in-depth risk assessment.47 In short, the Suspension Plan identified \"real and significant risks\" associated with the suspension, in particular reservoir, mechanical and environmental risks. These risks justified Ecuador's immediate intervention48 to avoid significant damage and economic loss.49\n\nTr.

Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n59.\n\nBurlington argues that the Motion is inadmissible as a matter of law, as the ICSID system does not provide for such a review mechanism. In any event, Burlington alleges that the Draft Action Plan does not affect the Tribunal's finding of unlawful expropriation.\n\n60.\n\nIn the first place, Burlington submits that the ICSID Convention \"firmly forecloses\" interlocutory reconsiderations such as the one sought by Ecuador. The ICSID Convention provides that review can only occur after a final award and is \"extremely circumscribed\".50 The Tribunal has no power to invent remedies not present in the ICSID framework.51 In addition, the Tribunal's implied or inherent powers are only \"gap-filling powers\"; they cannot operate in a manner \"contrary to the positive architecture of the ICSID Convention and Rules\".52 The kind of \"open-ended reconsideration\" requested by Ecuador would lead to \"procedural paralysis\", in particular in bifurcated or trifurcated cases.53\n\nTr.

See also: Burlington's Closing Statement, Slide 74.\n\n61.\n\nMore specifically, Burlington states that (i) the ICSID system allows no reconsideration of final decisions;54 (ii) the Decision on Liability is final according to the principle of *res judicata* ;55 and (iii) the Tribunal has no inherent powers under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention or otherwise to entertain the Motion.56 For Burlington, the Decision on Liability is not a draft. Even though it is not a final award, it is final as to liability \"just as the Decision on Jurisdiction was to jurisdiction\".57 The finality and *res judicata* nature of pre-award decisions was confirmed in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* and *Perenco v. Ecuador*,58 as well as in other cases.59 In addition, Burlington highlights that Ecuador acknowledged the finality of preaward decisions disposing of issues in this case when it objected to the purported reintroduction of claims that had been discarded at the jurisdictional stage.60\n\nReply, \u00b6 268.\n\nReply, \u00b6 269; C-Comments on *SCB v.

Tanesco* cannot be understood as an \"endorsement of free-for-all reconsideration\".61 That decision confirms that ICSID tribunals only assume a power to reconsider final decisions \"in circumstances of the most extreme injustice\", such as perpetrating fraud upon the tribunal.62 Unlike the present dispute, so says Burlington, *SCB v. Tanesco* presented an \"extreme set of facts\", where the tribunal was deliberately misled on a material fact, which required the tribunal to fashion a \"correspondingly extreme \u2013 and unprecedented \u2013 remedy\".63 In doing so, the tribunal stressed that the power to reconsider is not unlimited, since an unconstrained power would lead to considerable uncertainty. It therefore set an \"extremely high threshold\" for reconsideration, which is not met here.64\n\nC-Comments on *SCB v. Tanesco*, p. 2.\n\n*Id*., p. 1.\n\n*Id*., p. 2.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n63.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's questions on the pertinence of Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, Burlington submits that (i) revision is not allowed if the relevant fact was known prior to the issuance of an award;65 (ii) Ecuador has not alleged a fact that could support the application of Article 51 by analogy;66 and (iii) Ecuador failed to act timely as it was in possession of the Draft Action Plan for 135 days before it filed it.67 While Ecuador now argues that that document is \"decisive\", it \"did not think so at the time\".68 Regardless of Ecuador's motives, Burlington insists that \"if a party seeking to reopen a past decision was, or should have been aware before the decision was issued of the facts upon which reconsideration is sought, such a request must be denied\".69\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 191-194.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 195-199.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 200-202; C-Comments on *SCB v.

On the law, and more specifically as regards the complaint that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 74 HL breached due process, the Motion is a \"direct appeal\" of a legal determination, which is \"categorically foreclosed\" under the ICSID system.70 As confirmed in *SCB v. Tanesco*, the power of reconsideration, if it exists, cannot encompass the situation where \"an unsuccessful party simply wants to re-argue an issue\".71 In any event, the Tribunal's decision was \"entirely correct\", since (i) Ecuador's conduct was \"expressly *prohibited* \" under Ecuadorian law and therefore breached the principle of legality;72 (ii) no inherent power otherwise authorized Ecuador to intervene in the Blocks;73 and (iii) the Tribunal's inquiry under Article 74 HL obviated the need to assess the applicability of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*.74\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 205.\n\nC-Comments on *SCB v.

Tanesco*, the Draft Action Plan \"was neither \u2018material' nor could it have had \u2018an impact' on the Tribunal's decision on liability\".79 The Plan was only the starting point for discussions within the Consortium and was not intended to reflect Burlington's or the Consortium's views on the risks of the planned suspension.80 It remained a draft enumerating a number of issues. That draft was superseded by conversations held in Bogota on 18-19 June 2009;81 by Ecuador's suspension plan review of 30 June 2009;82 by the decision of the Consortium's representatives entitled \"Consent Action of the Representatives\" of 8 July 2009 authorizing suspension;83 and by the organigram of the Consortium's postsuspension team.84 The draft status of the plan is demonstrated by the fact that various proposals which it contains, such as terminating work contracts, were not retained.85 As Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 testified, \"we moved on to a new plan\".86\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 217.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 218; C-Comments on *SCB v.

Tanesco*, p. 4.\n\n*Id*., p. 4, note 17.\n\n67.\n\nRegarding the risks alleged by Ecuador, Burlington claims that the suspension would not have increased the risk of reservoir, mechanical or environmental damage. It stresses that \"controlled suspension of operations is routine and does not create significant risk of harm\".89 It further highlights that the Consortium suspended operations for a week in all of Block 7 in 2005, as well as in all of Block 21 and parts of Block 7 in 2006, without any material harm to the oilfields.90\n\nTr.

Applicable legal framework**\n---------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nEcuador invokes Articles 49(2), 51, 52 of the ICSID Convention, as well as Rules 25 and 38(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in support of the Motion.99 Ecuador also relies on Article 44 of the ICSID Convention to argue that the Tribunal has inherent powers to entertain the Motion. For its part, Burlington relies on Article 53 of the Convention to argue that the Motion is inadmissible.\n\nEcuador also invoked various other provisions, such as Articles 14 and 48 of the ICSID Convention, as well as Rule 12 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which the Tribunal does not deem necessary to spell out in more detail at this juncture.\n\n73.\n\nArticle 44 of the ICSID Convention, which deals with the procedural powers of ICSID tribunals, reads as follows:\n\n\"Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question\".\n\n74.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention concerning the rectification of awards, is worded as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. [\u2026]\".\n\n75.\n\nArticle 51 of the ICSID Convention, which is the provision on revision of awards, has the following relevant wording:\n\n\"(1) Either party may request revision of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant's ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.\n\n(2) The application shall be made within 90 days after the discovery of such fact and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.\n\n[\u2026]\".\n\n76.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention about the annulment of awards, reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based\n\n[\u2026]\".\n\n77.\n\nArticle 53 of the ICSID Convention, which provides for the finality of ICSID awards, is worded as follows:\n\n\"(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52\".\n\n78.\n\nArbitration Rule 25 entitled \"Correction of Errors\", has the following content:\n\n\"An accidental error in any instrument or supporting document may, with the consent of the other party or by leave of the Tribunal, be corrected at any time before the award is rendered\".\n\n79.\n\nFinally, Arbitration Rule 38 dealing with the closure of the proceeding, reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) When the presentation of the case by the parties is completed, the proceeding shall be declared closed.\n\n(2) Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points\".\n\n**2. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal will address its power to reconsider the Decision on Liability (2.1), and then review the two legs of the Motion, namely the contention that the Tribunal erred as a matter of law (2.2) and that it was misled by Burlington and reached its decision on the basis of incomplete facts (2.3).\n\n**2.1 Power to reconsider the Decision on Liability**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to Ecuador's contention, Burlington has not accepted the admissibility of the Motion. Indeed, Burlington merely accepted that Ecuador raise the Motion in parallel to the quantum proceedings. Specifically, Burlington stated that it had \"no objection to either party raising any requests for reconsideration or clarification in the context of its pleadings in the quantum phase\".100 The lack of objection went to the procedural setting of the request for reconsideration, not to admissibility.\n\nLetter of 1 February 2013 from Burlington to the Tribunal, p. 1.\n\n82.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules contain provisions dealing with the power of tribunals to reconsider their decisions.101 Unlike most national arbitration laws and the New York Convention, the ICSID legal framework distinguishes between \"decisions\" and \"awards\". The term \"award\" is reserved for the decision putting an end to the arbitration, which under other regimes is called a final award. So for instance, a decision denying jurisdiction over the entire dispute (Arbitration Rule 41(6)) or a decision on the merits that resolves all or all the remaining claims before the tribunal is an \"award\" (Article 48(3) ICSID Convention). On the other hand, a preliminary decision affirming jurisdiction or resolving other issues arising \"on the road\" to the final award, e.g. on applicable law, or liability, or part of the claims, is a (pre-award) \"decision\" for ICSID purposes. Under other regimes, these decisions would be designated by terms such as interim, preliminary, interlocutory, or partial awards.\n\nExcept for Article 39(3) of the Arbitration Rules, which provides that the tribunal \"may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations\" on provisional measures.\n\n83.\n\nPre-award decisions must also be distinguished from procedural orders that organize the proceedings and from provisional measures. Due to their nature, such procedural orders and orders for provisional remedies can be reconsidered at any time, if circumstances so require.102 In effect, Arbitration Rule 39(3) expressly authorizes a tribunal to reopen a decision on provisional measures.103 This is the only provision in the ICSID legal framework expressly empowering a tribunal to reconsider a decision which it has rendered.\n\nSee, for instance in respect of procedural orders: *Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40 (\" *Churchill v. Indonesia* \"), Procedural Order No. 13 of 18 November 2014, \u00b6 33(1).\n\nArticle 39(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. See: note 101 above.\n\n84.\n\nThese distinctions being made, one notes that the ICSID framework is silent about the possibility of reopening a pre-award decision.\n\n85.\n\nThe majority in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* held that decisions preliminary to an award \"that resolve points in dispute between the Parties\" are vested with *res judicata* and can thus not be reopened.104 A similar view was adopted in *Perenco v. Ecuador*,105 although the tribunal envisaged the possibility that \"a very specific situation\" may call for a tribunal to \"revisit its prior findings\".106 By contrast, the tribunal in *SCB v. Tanesco* recently held that pre-award decisions are not *res judicata*, and that \"there may be circumstances where a tribunal should consider reopening a decision that it has made\".107 This view had previously been expressed in the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab108 in the *Conoco* case just referred to.109\n\n*ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of 10 March 2014, \u00b6 21 (**Exh. EL-237**). For completeness, it is noted that the *Conoco* tribunal later refused to reconsider that decision *(**ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,* Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision of 10 March 2014 of 9 February 2016, \u00b6 37).\n\nThe tribunal stated that \"[t]here is ample prior authority in support of the view once the tribunal decides with finality any of the factual or legal questions put to it by the parties [\u2026] such a decision becomes *res judicata* \". *Perenco v. Ecuador*, Decision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion of 10 April 2015, \u00b6 43 (**Exh. CL-390**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 42.\n\n*SCB v. Tanesco,* Award of 12 September 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 318, 320 (**Exh. TL-001**).\n\n*ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, Dissenting Opinion of Georges Abi-Saab of 10 March 2014, \u00b6 57 (**Exh. EL-237**).\n\nFor completeness, it is noted that Prof. Bucher dissented along the same lines on the occasion of the second *Conoco* reconsideration decision (*ConocoPhillips et al. v. Venezuela*, Dissenting Opinion of Andreas Bucher of 9 February 2016).\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *SCB v. Tanesco* when it states that a preaward decision does not carry *res judicata* effects, for reasons essentially connected to the structure or architecture of the ICSID Convention. First, apart from orders on procedural matters under Article 44 and under other rules dealing with the organization of the proceedings and other than decisions on provisional measures, the ICSID framework contemplates that arbitration proceedings give rise only to (i) one decision on preliminary objections, if such objections are raised and are not joined to the merits (Arbitration Rule 41(4)), and to (ii) one (final) award (Article 48 ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules 46 ff.).110 It provides further that the award must deal with \"every question submitted to the Tribunal\" (Article 48(3)) and contain the \"decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it\" (Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i)). To comply with these provisions, the practice is for tribunals to incorporate earlier decisions into their (final) award.\n\nThis restrictive position was, for instance, adopted in *Tanesco v. Independent Power Tanzania* : \"[T]he ICSID Arbitration Rules contain no provisions which permit or even contemplate \u2018Partial' or \u2018Interim' Awards, indeed, it seemed to the Tribunal that the Rules contemplated only one, Final Award\". *Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd. v. Independent Power Tanzania Ltd.*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/7 (\" *Tanesco v. Independent Power Tanzania\"),* Final Award of 22 June 2001, \u00b6 32 (**Exh. TL-001**).\n\n87.\n\nSecond, remedies, i.e. rectification, requests for supplementary decisions, interpretation, revision, and annulment, are only available from the time when the award is rendered. In other words, a decision affirming jurisdiction, for instance, can only be challenged in annulment proceedings brought once the (final) award in which it is incorporated is issued.\n\n88.\n\nThird, following the same logic, the duty of ICSID Contracting States to recognize decisions emanating from the Centre and to enforce pecuniary obligations imposed by such decisions under Article 54(1) of the Convention only applies to awards, not to earlier decisions even though these could include pecuniary obligations, for instance a cost order contained in a decision accepting jurisdiction.\n\n89.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the requirement for incorporation of earlier decisions into the award, the absence of remedies against these decisions, and the fact that the Contracting States' obligation to recognize and enforce only attaches to the award, not to earlier decisions, show that *res judicata* attaches to the \"award\" in the ICSID meaning and not to earlier decisions.\n\n90.\n\nThis being so, the lack of *res judicata* does not mean that decisions on preliminary objections and what under other rules would be called interim or preliminary awards on issues other than jurisdiction and admissibility can necessarily be reopened. Indeed, ICSID tribunals have had no hesitation finding that preliminary decisions bind the parties and the tribunal in the course of the proceedings. That view is sometimes put in terms of *res judicata* (*quod non*, as was concluded above).111 It is also occasionally expressed as a manifestation of the intentions of the tribunal, as for example in *Electrabel v. Hungary* :\n\n\"Although necessarily described as a \u2018Decision' and not an \u2018Award' under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules, the several decisions and reasons contained in this Decision are intended by the Tribunal to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of these arbitration proceedings\".112\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II,* Decision on Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings of 26 June 2002, \u00b6 45 (**Exh. EL-141**) (\"[A]t whatever stage of the case it is decided, a decision on a particular point constitutes a res judicata as between the parties to that decision if it is a necessary part of the eventual determination and is dealt with as such by the tribunal\").\n\n*Electrabel v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability of 30 November 2012, \u00b6 10.1 (**Exh. CL-349**).\n\n91.\n\nIn the words of the second *Amco Asia* tribunal, the approach is stated as a general principle \"that a right, question, or fact distinctly put in issue and distinctly determined cannot be disputed\".113 Whatever the justification, these tribunals express the opinion that an issue resolved once in the course of an arbitration should in principle not be revisited in the same proceedings. Irrespective of *res judicata*, the rationale for this opinion is obvious: a contrary view would defeat the purpose of efficient dispute settlement, entailing constant re-litigation of issues already resolved, with unavoidable adverse consequences in terms of increased costs and length of proceedings. In addition, the possibility of re-litigating issues would jeopardize legal certainty and ultimately undermine the confidence of the users in the system.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 (Resubmitted Case) *(\"Amco Asia v. Indonesia II\"),* Decision on Jurisdiction of 10 May 1988, \u00b6 30 (**Exh. CL-330**). See also: *CMS v. Argentina,* Award of 12 May 2005, \u00b6 126 (**Exh. CL-99**) (\"It must also be noted that in connection with the merits the Respondent has again raised certain jurisdictional issues that were addressed in the jurisdictional phase of the case, such as the jus standi of the Claimant. These issues were decided upon at that stage and will not be reopened in this Award\").\n\n92.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that ICSID tribunal decisions (other than orders on procedure and provisional measures) which are not final awards are not *res judicata*, but are nevertheless binding on the parties and the tribunal within the proceedings in which they were issued, the Tribunal also agrees with the finding in *SCB v. Tanesco* according to which \"there may be circumstances where a tribunal should consider reopening a decision that it has made\".114\n\n*SCB v. Tanesco,* Award of 12 September 2016, \u00b6 320 (**Exh. TL-001**).\n\n93.\n\nThe *SCB* tribunal saw practical advantages in accepting such a power of reconsideration, be it based on Article 51(1) or 44 of the ICSID Convention: \"It avoids having the Tribunal decide issues on the merits on the basis of a decision which has been seriously called into question, and then have the parties wait until the whole matter has been included in its final award before having its decision reopened or subject to annulment, thus potentially wasting the time and expense that has been incurred since the Tribunal became aware that its decision could be called into question. Efficiency grounds alone suggest that there may be circumstances where a tribunal should consider reopening a decision that it has made\".115 In other words, procedural efficiency, which requires that an interim decision be binding on the tribunal that has issued such a decision, may at the same time call for an exception to the principle of binding force under certain circumstances. The Tribunal agrees with this view.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n94.\n\nThe question thus is to determine what exceptional circumstances may warrant reopening a decision that binds an ICSID tribunal. In answering this question, the Tribunal is in agreement with the *SCB* decision, pursuant to which it \"should be guided by, although not bound by, the limitations that apply to awards\", adding that the power to reconsider extends \"at least [\u2026] to the grounds for reopening an award in Article 51\".116 The limitations applicable to awards include the prohibition of appeals in Article 53(1), the restrictive bases for revision in Article 51, and possibly the limited grounds for annulment in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, to which the Tribunal will revert.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 322.\n\n95.\n\nEcuador refers to a number of provisions, quoted above, to substantiate its argument that exceptional circumstances may justify reconsidering decisions preliminary to an award. While Ecuador concedes that none of these provisions specifically apply to pre-award decisions, it argues that \"exceptional circumstances\" warrant reopening a pre-award decision in all cases where it can be shown \"that any of the grounds for reopening a Convention award or decision apply\",117 or if it is \"otherwise in the interest of justice\".118 Ecuador further submits that the standard of review to reconsider the Decision on Liability \"must necessarily be lower under *pre-closing* circumstances than the standard of review at the *post-award* annulment stage (or even in *post-closing* circumstances)\".119\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 20.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 115.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow Ecuador's far-reaching interpretation of a tribunal's power to reconsider pre-award decisions or the proposed standard of review. The tribunal in *SCB v. Tanesco* rightly held that an unconstrained power of reconsideration would lead to \"considerable uncertainty\".120 In the present case, the Decision on Liability is binding on the Tribunal and the Parties; it is not a draft that can be reopened at will.\n\n*SCB v. Tanesco,* Award of 12 September 2016, \u00b6 322 (**Exh. TL-001**).\n\n97.\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, guidance must be sought by analogy in the limitations applicable to the reconsideration of awards. In this respect, Article 51(1) allows a party to request the revision of an award \"on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award\", provided that \"when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and the applicant and that the applicant's ignorance of the fact was not due to negligence\". Article 51(2) requires that the application be made within 90 days after the discovery of such fact and no more than 3 years after the award was rendered. *Venezuela Holdings* summarized the requirements of knowledge and timing contained in the first paragraph of Article 51 as follows:\n\n\"Only a fact that existed when the award was rendered could have been known when the award was rendered. Only ignorance of a fact that existed when the award was rendered could be due to negligence. It follows that only a fact that existed when the award was rendered may form the basis for a request for revision under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention\".121\n\n*Venezuela Holdings, B.V. et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27 (\" *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela* \"), Decision on Revision of 12 June 2015, \u00b6 3.1.11.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that this provision, although worded as a post-award remedy, may apply by analogy to pre-award decisions. This view relies in particular on Article 51(3), which favors a solution where, to the extent possible, the tribunal that rendered the award is reconstituted to deal with a revision request. Where the arbitration is still pending and the tribunal still constituted, it appears all the more compelling that the tribunal be afforded the opportunity to revise a pre-award decision if a decisive and previously unknown fact comes to light.\n\n99.\n\nThis view is further confirmed when one observes that it is generally accepted in proceedings before both international tribunals and national courts that an adjudicatory body can reopen a judgment or award that it has rendered in revision proceedings.\n\n100.\n\nThe International Court of Justice ruled that it cannot be excluded that the same tribunal revise a judgment \"in special circumstances when new facts of decisive importance have been discovered\", a process which cannot be likened to an appeal and which would \"conform with rules generally provided in statutes or laws issued for courts of justice\".122 Mixed claims commissions as well as the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, have also accepted the existence of a power to revise their prior decisions or awards under exceptional circumstances, such as the appearance of decisive new evidence, even in the absence of an express power under the applicable rules.123 The Iran-US Claims Tribunal circumscribed exceptional circumstances justifying the revision of an award to situations where the challenged decision was induced by fraud or perjury and to cases of \"discovery of some fact of such a nature as to be a decisive factor\",124 provided that the ignorance of the new fact was not due to the applicant's negligence and that it was raised in a timely manner.125\n\n*Effect of Awards of Compensation made by the UN Administrative Tribunal*, Advisory Opinion of 13 July 1954, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 55 (**Exh. EL-310**).\n\nSee, for instance: *Lehigh Valley Railroad Company et al. (United States) v. Germany (Sabotage Cases),* Decision of 15 December 1933, R.I.A.A., Vol. VIII, p. 188 (**Exh. EL-238**).\n\nSee in particular: *Ram International Industries, Inc., Universal Electronics, Inc., General Aviation Supply, Inc., Galaxy Electronics Corp. v. The Air Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran*, Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, Case No. 148 (\" *Ram v. Iran* \"), Decision No. Dec 118-148-1 of 28 December 1993, \u00b6 20.\n\n*Ram v. Iran*, Decision No. Dec 118-148-1, 28 December 1993, \u00b6 24; *The United States of America v. The Islamic Republic of Iran*, Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, Case No. B36, Decision No. Dec 126-B36-2, 17 March 1997, \u00b6 15.\n\n101.\n\nAn additional reason for accepting to apply Article 51 by analogy is the timing that it envisages. Ecuador argues that, unless a remedy analogous to that of Article 51 were available, a party would be deprived of an opportunity to seek revision when the relevant fact became known to the applicant and the Tribunal after the preliminary decision but before the award.126\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 58.\n\n102.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties whether the absence of an analogous remedy may not encourage a party that discovers a decisive fact to conceal that discovery until after the award is rendered.127 The Parties did not dispute that Article 51 may find application by analogy, although Ecuador argued that the conditions set out in Article 51 should not apply as such to pre-award requests for revision, while Burlington submitted that Ecuador's request did not fulfill the conditions set in that provision.\n\nProcedural Order No. 29, \u00b6 4(a).\n\n103.\n\nMore specifically, in respect of the time limit set in Article 51(2), Ecuador states that it \"does not apply\", since it was only stipulated to avoid indefinite revisions after the issuance of an award. As the arbitration here is still pending, the time limit is \"devoid of any rationale\", says Ecuador. This position appears to be supported by *SCB v. Tanesco*, where the tribunal decided that the constraints of the requirements of Article 51 need not apply if pre-award decisions are not considered to be *res judicata*.\n\n104.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the discovery of outcome-determinative facts unknown to the Tribunal and the applicant prior to the rendering of a pre-award decision should open the possibility of revising such decision prior to the issuance of the award in application of Article 51 by analogy. This exception to the binding nature of a preliminary decision must, however, be balanced against the interests of legal certainty and procedural efficiency. These interests militate in favor of keeping the requirements set out in Article 51(1), as well as the time limit of 90 days from the discovery of the decisive fact set out in Article 51(2). While the time limits for the revision of an award (90 days after discovery and in any event no later than three years after the award) are meant to avoid that an award vested with *res judicata* may be put into question indefinitely, a consideration that does not apply here, there are nonetheless good reasons to stick to the 90 day time period even when the proceedings are still pending. Indeed, the sooner the discovery is brought to the attention of the tribunal, the lesser the potential consequences on the proceedings, as this case well shows. Moreover, the existence of a time limit encourages \"good behavior\" and discourages \"bad behavior\", such as concealing the fact until such time as a party considers it strategic or tactical to disclose it. Such a limitation cannot be said to unduly restrict the applicant's rights, as parties and counsel seem in a better position to promptly assess and act on the discovery of a new fact while they are still actively involved in pursuing their case than after the end of the proceedings.\n\n105.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal considers that a pre-award decision (other than a procedural order or decision on provisional measures) may be revised under Article 51 applied by analogy, provided (i) a fact is discovered; (ii) of such a nature as decisively to affect the pre-award decision; (iii) which was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant when the pre-award decision was rendered; (iv) the applicant's ignorance not being due to negligence; and (v) the request for reconsideration being made within 90 days after the discovery of the fact.\n\n106.\n\nTurning now to the other provisions that Ecuador invokes to support the Motion, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's reliance on Article 49(2) of the Convention and Article 25 of the Rules is to no avail, since Ecuador does not allege that the Tribunal omitted to decide a particular question in the Decision on Liability nor does it request the rectification of a clerical, arithmetical or similar error. Ecuador also accepts that Article 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules does not apply to pre-award decisions and that, in the present case, it cannot apply since the proceedings still have not been closed. At best, Rule 38(2) could have applied by analogy if Ecuador had requested to file new evidence just prior to the issuance of the Decision on Liability, which it did not do.\n\n107.\n\nFinally, Article 52 of the ICSID Convention deals with annulment proceedings. Unlike revision proceedings which, as a rule, are conducted by the tribunal which issued the litigious decision, annulment actions are brought before a different body, namely (under the ICSID regime) before an annulment committee. If it were to assume the power to rule on a challenge based on grounds falling within the scope of Article 52, the Tribunal would in effect exercise a competence reserved for another body in disregard of the organization of powers under the ICSID Convention.\n\n108.\n\nIn conclusion, it is the Tribunal's view that a decision preliminary to an ICSID award (other than a procedural order or decision on provisional measures) is not a *res judicata* until it is incorporated into the award pursuant to Article 48(3) of the Convention, but that it nonetheless binds the parties and the tribunal. Therefore, such decisions can be reconsidered only in exceptional and very limited circumstances. Absent any specific rule in the ICSID framework, the most reasonable approach is to apply by analogy the test for revision provided in Article 51 of the Convention. This is so mainly because, under Article 51, the power of revision is in principle entrusted to the tribunal that issued the litigious decision. By contrast, it does not appear appropriate to resort to Article 52 by analogy, since the power to annul awards is vested in a body other than the tribunal that issued the decision. An analogy with the grounds of Article 52 would thus disturb the allocation of powers mandated by the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, considerations of efficiency of the dispute settlement process and of manageability of the proceedings call for the application of strict limits so as to avoid opening the floodgates of reconsideration requests.\n\n109.\n\nHaving reached these conclusions, the Tribunal will now review the two grounds for reconsideration raised by Ecuador.\n\n**2.2 The Tribunal erred as a matter of law**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nEcuador alleges that the Tribunal erred as a matter of law with respect to its \"*sua sponte* interpretation\" of Article 74 HL and the contradiction concerning the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*. In this context, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal breached the Parties' due process rights, since the Parties only discussed Article 74 HL in the context of *caducidad*, whereas the Tribunal's interpretation of that provision addressed suspension and intervention.\n\n111.\n\nTo the extent that Ecuador asserts that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 74 HL and the decision to dispense with analyzing whether Burlington could also rely on the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*, are errors of law, the Tribunal agrees with Burlington that these submissions amount to an appeal. As was discussed above, appeals are impermissible under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n112.\n\nTurning then to due process, Ecuador complains that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 74(4) HL \"was never debated nor proposed by the Parties in the liability phase\".128 For Ecuador, that provision does not address the power to intervene in the Blocks and take over the operations, but relates to *caducidad* only. According to Ecuador, subject to *force majeure,* the law of Ecuador and the PSCs barred the Consortium from suspending its operations, on the grounds of the principle of continuity. On that basis, Ecuador argues that it had inherent or implicit powers to perform the PSCs in lieu of the Consortium in default, and that it could therefore intervene in the Blocks and assume operations when it did.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1484:5-7 (Closing, Mr. Silva Romero).\n\n113.\n\nFollowing the approach outlined above, this complaint falls within the scope of Article 52 and thus within the remit of an *ad hoc* committee. This being so, the Tribunal is mindful of the *SCB* decision which does not appear to entirely rule out resort to Article 52 by analogy. Indeed, paragraph 320 quoted above refers to the decision being \"reopened or subject to annulment\". With this opinion in mind and although it favors limiting the power of reconsideration to cases within the ambit Article 51 for the reasons explained above, the Tribunal will nevertheless briefly address this complaint, for the sake of completeness.\n\n114.\n\nThe record shows that Article 74(4) HL was debated prior to the issuance of the Decision on Liability in connection with suspension and intervention. The second expert report of Ecuador's expert, Dr. Aguilar, discusses Article 74(4) HL in the context of the principle of continuity and suspension of operations.129 Further, Ecuador cited the text of Article 74(4) HL in its Counter-Memorial and added that \"Burlington's unilateral decision to suspend operations in Blocks 7 and 21, without cause, was illegal both under the Ecuadorian Constitution and under the HCL\".130\n\nAguilar ER2, \u00b6 89.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Liability, corrected, \u00b6 600.

See also: Claimant's Supplemental Memorial on Liability, note 134.\n\n115.\n\nFurthermore, compliance with fundamental principles of procedure and especially the parties' opportunity to be heard does not mean that a tribunal cannot adopt its own reasoning.131 The maxim of *iura novit curia* allows the Tribunal to establish and assess the content of the law without being constrained by the Parties' arguments, as long as it remains within the legal framework established by the Parties.132 Since both Parties provided their views on the scope of Article 74(4) HL during the liability phase, the Tribunal's interpretation of that provision is clearly within the legal framework set by the Parties. The same is true in respect of the arguments on the principle of continuity133 and the provisions dealing with suspension and intervention in the hydrocarbons sector.134\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12 (\" *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* \"), Decision on the Annulment Application of Caratube International Oil Company LLP of 21 February 2014, \u00b6 94 (**Exh. CL-335**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 301 and note 583.\n\nUnder Article 314 of the 2008 Constitution only public services are governed by the principle of continuity, and Ecuador's expert, Dr. Aguilar, conceded that hydrocarbons exploitation is not a public service (Aguilar ER4, \u00b6 30). He also confirmed that the PSCs were distinct from the public services described in Article 249 of the 1998 Constitution, which was later replaced by Article 314 of the 2008 Constitution. See also: Aguilar ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\nThe power to intervene in economic sectors \u2013 such as stock exchanges, the electricity sector, the telecommunications sector or the mining sector \u2013 is explicitly regulated under Ecuadorian law as convincingly shown by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose (P\u00e9rez Loose ER, \u00b6\u00b6 13-21), but no express provision existed at the relevant time in respect of oilfield operations and it is telling that Ecuador amended Article 11 HL in 2010 to provide for intervention in the hydrocarbons sector. In other words, in July 2009, the only topical provisions were Article 74(4) HL read in conjunction with Article 75. (Law Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law and the Internal Tax System Law, Official Registry No. 244, 27 July 2010, Article 5(g) (**Exh. P\u00e9rez-** **13**)).\n\n116.\n\nIn conclusion, this leg of the Motion is denied.\n\n**2.3 The Tribunal was misled on the facts**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nEcuador alternatively argues that Burlington wrongfully withheld key evidence and misled the Tribunal. Ecuador invokes the Suspension Plan as the decisive fact which would affect the outcome of the Tribunal's determination that Burlington was unlawfully expropriated of its assets. This leg of the Motion falls within the scope of Article 51 applied by analogy. The Tribunal must thus review whether Ecuador's arguments fulfill the requirements of Article 51. They do not.\n\n118.\n\nIndeed, Ecuador knew of the existence of the Suspension Plan since 2011135 when Burlington noted that it was privileged in its privilege log. Ecuador later obtained the Suspension Plan on 1 August 2012 through document disclosure in the parallel *Perenco* case.136 Burlington thereafter produced the document in this arbitration on 14 November 2012 to Ecuador137 and Ecuador filed it on 14 December 2012,138 on the day of issuance of the Decision on Liability. Accordingly, 135 days lapsed between the moment when Ecuador became aware of the content of the Suspension Plan and when it produced that document in this arbitration. From August to December 2012, Ecuador had ample opportunity to advise the Tribunal that it had come into possession of a document that it regarded as decisive to the outcome of the case.\n\nLetter of 21 February 2011 from Burlington to Ecuador, p. 007, item 99 (**Exh. C-472**).\n\nLetter of 31 August 2012 from Perenco to Ecuador (**Exh. E-311**).\n\nLetter of 14 November 2012 from Burlington to Ecuador (**Exh. E-310**).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n119.\n\nOn this basis alone, this leg of the Motion fails and the Tribunal could dispense with further analysis. This said, the Tribunal recognizes that there is another view on the adequacy of applying the time limit of Article 51(2) of the Convention to requests for revision of pre-award decisions and, because the Parties have extensively argued this part of the Motion, the Tribunal will nevertheless briefly consider further arguments advanced by the Parties.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Burlington that Ecuador cannot now argue that it entered into Blocks 7 and 21 because of alleged risks justifying intervention and, argue at the same time, that it discovered these risks when it obtained a copy of the Suspension Plan.\n\n121.\n\nIt is true that Ecuador argues that its ability to rely on the Suspension Plan during the liability phase was compromised by Burlington's allegedly wrongful invocation of privilege. However, that argument fails, since the Tribunal considers that the Suspension Plan is indeed privileged under the work product doctrine, as it was generated by in-house and outside counsel for Perenco for the purposes of ongoing arbitral proceedings.139 Accordingly, it could only have been produced once Perenco consented to lift the privilege.\n\nThe document bears an identification number of Debevoise & Plimpton, thus demonstrating that it was generated by lawyers with input from technicians (Suspension Plan) dated 3 June 2009 (**Exh. E-309**). See: Tr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1438:22-1439:20 (Closing, Mr. Blackaby).\n\n122.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal also notes that the Suspension Plan contains no factual information that was previously unknown to the Parties or the Tribunal, nor was it susceptible of decisively influencing the outcome of the Decision on Liability.\n\n123.\n\nFirst, Burlington demonstrated that the Suspension Plan was the starting point of discussions on risks associated with the suspension, which was later superseded by other discussions between the Consortium partners, such as the meeting held in Bogota on 18-19 June 2009 and the Suspension Plan's review on 30 June 2009.140 Second, the Consortium offered on two occasions to provide Ecuador with \"additional details about the suspension activities\", but Ecuador did not follow up on these offers prior to intervening in the Blocks on 16 July 2009.141 Third, for Ecuador's expert RPS, the Suspension Plan showed that the Consortium conducted a risk assessment in or around June 2009.142 The expert added that that document \"expressly recognizes the risks and uncertainties\" which RPS had previously identified during the liability phase in relation to reservoir damage, mechanical damage and serious economic loss, as well as risks of sabotage and looting.143 RPS also insisted that prior to the Decision on Liability, it \"lacked the specific data necessary to decisively refute the testimony of Mr. Martinez\" that there were no significant risks associated with suspension.144 Be this as it may, these risks were abundantly debated prior to the Decision on Liability and the Suspension Plan adds nothing new in this respect, let alone does it provide the \"specific data\" that RPS required to assess the concreteness of the risks it had identified.\n\nDraft Minutes of Meeting in Bogota, 18-19 June 2010 (**Exh. E-534**) ; Ecuador Suspension Plan Review, 30 June 2009 (**Exh. C-200**).\n\nLetter of 13 July 2009 from Burlington and Perenco to the Ministry of Mines and Oil, (**Exh.

QUANTUM**\n----------------\n\n126.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that, by taking over Blocks 7 and 21 (which takeover became permanent on 30 August 2009), Ecuador expropriated Burlington's investments,145 and that this expropriation was unlawful.146 The Tribunal's task here is to determine what compensation is due to Burlington for Ecuador's treaty breach.\n\nDoL, \u00b6 535.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 543-545.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal will first provide an overview of the Parties' positions (Section A) and address the question of the standard of compensation (Section B). It will then determine whether the heads of claim sought by Burlington are compensable (Section C), followed by the valuation of the claims that pass this test (Section D). It will conclude its analysis with an assessment of Ecuador's defense on contributory negligence (Section E) and Burlington's request for post-award interest (Section F).\n\nA. **Overview of the Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Overview of Burlington's position**\n----------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nBurlington argues that it is entitled to full reparation for the losses resulting from Ecuador's unlawful expropriation of its investment, which (according to Burlington) the Tribunal defined expressly to include Burlington's contractual rights.147\n\nCM, \u00b6 72, with reference to: *Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 36-40.\n\n129.\n\nBurlington seeks compensation for the following three categories of losses:\n\ni. ***Past Law 42 dues*** paid or seized by Ecuador, i.e., \"[t]he accrued amounts owing to Burlington at the time of the expropriation as a result of Ecuador's failure to indemnify Burlington for Law 42 payments and seizures effected previously\".148 Burlington's quantum expert, Dr. Abdala of Compass Lexecon, calls this head of claim \"pre-expropriation tax debts\" and has calculated them from the day those taxes became effective (20 April 2006) until the date of the expropriation (30 August 2009).149 Burlington characterizes these losses as \"lost contract rights\".150\n\nii. The ***lost profits*** that Burlington would have received under the PSCs absent (or \"but for\") Ecuador's unlawful acts. Compass Lexecon refers to this head of damages as the value of Burlington's expropriated operating assets.151 According to Burlington, the valuation of these lost profits must take into account Burlington's contractual right to be indemnified against Law 42. Accordingly Compass Lexecon calculates these lost profits net of the economic effects of Law 42.\n\niii. Burlington's ***lost opportunity*** to engage in good faith negotiations with regard to an extension of the Block 7 PSC.152 Compass Lexecon refers to this head of damages as the \"Value of Block 7 Extension\".153\n\nMem., \u00b6 72(b).\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 2(ii).\n\nMem., title B at page 48.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 2(i).\n\nMem., \u00b6 72(c).\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 2(iii).\n\n130.\n\nIn its Second Report, Compass Lexecon quantifies these damages as follows:\n\n**Table 1: Summary of Damages to Burlington as of September 15, 2014**\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n|  | **US$ millions** |  |\n|  |  |  | **Block 7** | **Block 21** | **Total** |  |\n| **a** | **Pre-Expropriation Tax Debts** | **113.9** | **124.9** | **238.7** |\n| **b** | **Value of Operating Assets** | **244.0** | **567.1** | **811.1** |\n|  | *Historical Lost Profits (pre-September 2014)* | *244.0* | *388.6* | *632.6* |\n|  | *Fair Market Value as of September 2014* | *-* | *178.5* | *178.5* |\n| **c** | **Value of Block 7 Extension** | **300.5** | **n.a.** | **300.5** |\n| **a+b+c Total Damages** | **658.4** | **692.0** | **1,350.3** |\n|  | *Source: Compass Lexecon Second Valuation Model.* | *(CLE\\-49)* |  |\n\n131.\n\nBurlington claims compound interest on all of these amounts and requests that the award be protected against taxation.\n\n132.\n\nIn the Updated Model, using a valuation date of 31 August 2016 and all of Compass Lexecon's assumptions, Burlington's damages are quantified damages at **USD 1,515,603,095**, including pre-award interest.\n\n**2. Overview of Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nEcuador denies that Burlington has a right to be compensated for the preexpropriation tax debts, or for the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC. First, it submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over either of these claims, which in its view are contract and not treaty claims. Even if the Tribunal should find that it has jurisdiction, says Ecuador, both claims fail on their merits.\n\n134.\n\nBy contrast, and of course subject to its motion for reconsideration, Ecuador acknowledges that Burlington has a right to the fair market value (FMV) of its expropriated investment (which Ecuador appears to accept is reflected in the value of its rights under the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 on the date of the expropriation). However, it contends that Burlington's valuation of these assets is grossly inflated, mainly because Burlington misapplies the relevant standard of compensation, uses the wrong valuation date, adopts false assumptions (in particular, the failure to account for Law 42 taxes when projecting future profits) and applies an exaggerated interest rate.\n\n135.\n\nIn his Second Report, Ecuador's expert, Mr. M\u00e9lard de Feuardent of Fair Links, quantifies Burlington's damages as follows:154\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| High case |  | Fair Market Value of Burlington\u2019s assets as of August 2009 **(a)** | Post expropriation interest August 2009 - August 2015 O>) | Total damage value as of August 2015 **(c)=(a) +** (b) |\n| production scenario Base case | *MS* | 28.8 | 4.3 | 33.1 |\n| production scenario Low case | *MS* | 26.3 | 3.9 | 30.2 |\n| production scenario | *MS* | 20.6 | 3.1 | 23.7 |\n\nThe Tribunal understands these figures to be in million USD.\n\n136.\n\nEcuador argues that, in any event, any compensation awarded to Burlington must reflect Burlington's contribution to its own losses.\n\n137.\n\nFinally, Ecuador argues that Burlington's claim for interest is unreasonable.\n\n138.\n\nIn the Updated Model, using a valuation date of 30 August 2009 and all of Fair Links' assumptions, Ecuador's valuation of the Burlington's base case scenario is quantified at **USD 27,597,980**, including pre-award interest.\n\nB. **Standard of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n139.\n\nBurlington argues that, because the Tribunal found that the expropriation was unlawful, the appropriate standard of compensation is the customary international law standard of full reparation. Relying in particular on the *Chorz\u00f3w* case,155 as well as on the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the \"ILC Articles\"),156 Burlington submits that this standard requires that the award fully eliminate the consequences of Ecuador's unlawful conduct, and reestablish the situation that would have existed in the absence of that unlawful conduct.157\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 49, 110, referring to: *Case Concerning The Factory At Chorz\u00f3w (Claim for* *Indemnity) (The Merits)*, Permanent Court of International Justice, Series A., No. 17, Decision of 13 September 1928 *(\"Chorz\u00f3w\"),* p. 47 (**Exh. CL-102**) ; as well as: *Vivendi v. Argentina II,* Award of August 20, 2007, \u00b6 8.2.7 (**Exh. CL-123**) ; *Opinion in the Lusitania Cases,* United States-Germany Decisions of Mixed Claims Commission, 1 November 1923, 7 *United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards* 32 (1932), p. 39 (**Exh. CL-124**).\n\nInternational Law Commission Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ILC Articles\") (**Exh. CL-127**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 2.\n\n140.\n\nIn the context of an unlawful expropriation, \"the tribunal's task is to require the State to place the investor in the economic position that it would have enjoyed had the wrongful acts never occurred \u2013 that is, the situation that would have existed \u2018but for' the unlawful expropriation\".158 If restitution is impossible or impracticable, as here, the Tribunal should make an award of damages \"equal to the current value of the investment taken, plus compensation for any losses that would not have been incurred but for the State's unlawful actions\".159\n\nMem., \u00b6 52.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n141.\n\nAccording to Burlington, this standard applies to all unlawful expropriations, regardless of the breach that caused that unlawfulness. It argues that Article III(1) of the BIT provides that all expropriations are unlawful (this being the default position agreed by the contracting States), unless four cumulative conditions are met: the taking must be (i) for a public interest, (ii) non-discriminatory, (iii) in accordance with due process of law, and (iv) upon payment of compensation.160 Stated differently, if any one of these conditions is not met, the expropriation is unlawful. Burlington submits that the Treaty makes no distinction between these conditions, and there is no authority under international law to make one.161 There is thus no basis for Ecuador's theory that a failure to pay compensation \"somehow renders an expropriation \u2018less unlawful'\".162\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 31.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n142.\n\nAs the Treaty itself does not provide the standard of compensation for unlawful expropriations, Burlington argues that the Tribunal must turn to the customary international law standard. Any expropriation carried out in violation of Article III(1) thus triggers the full reparation standard set out in *Chorz\u00f4w.* Restitution is not feasible and so the Tribunal must award compensation sufficient to wipe out all of the consequences of the illegal act.\n\n143.\n\nBurlington contends that, as with the other requirements for a lawful expropriation, the compensation requirement would serve no practical purpose if an expropriation that *violated* the requirement attracted the same remedial consequences as an expropriation that *complied with* the requirement, with the result that there would be no incentive for States to pay prompt, adequate and effective compensation.163 Upholding Ecuador's position would incite States to expropriate industries with likely increases in value so as to limit liability to the value at the time of the initial seizure, and impose a \"hierarchy of unlawfulness\" that does not exist in the BIT or any other investment treaty.164\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 32; Tr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 13:3-14:17 (Opening, Paulsson).\n\nReply, \u00b6 56.\n\n144.\n\nAccording to Burlington, far from being an \"anomaly\" as claimed by Ecuador, tribunals regularly awarded full reparation in cases of expropriation that are unlawful for failure to pay compensation, as demonstrated in *ConocoPhillips* (a case relied upon by Ecuador, except for this specific matter), *Unglaube, Siemens* and *Funnekotter*.165 Furthermore, leading commentators such as Dolzer and Schreuer do not provide any support for \"the notion that some unlawful expropriations are remedied differently from others\".166\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 38-41, citing: *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 342-43, 401 (**Exh. CL-343**) ; *Unglaube and Unglaube v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case Nos.

Zimbabwe\"),* Award of 22 April 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 107 (**Exh. CL-150**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 43.\n\n145.\n\nBurlington submits that Ecuador's recited authorities are not persuasive in this regard. For Burlington, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which distinguishes between \"inherently unlawful dispossession\" and expropriation unlawful by failure to pay compensation, provides \"limited, if any, guidance on a State's remedial obligations to foreign investors under investment treaties\".167 The ECtHR deals with takings by a State of property of its own nationals, and therefore applies different standards of protection than those applicable in international investment law. The doctrine of the \"margin of appreciation\", and thus a larger degree of deference to the State, is also inept in the international investment context, as confirmed in *Siemens* and *Quasar*,168 and indeed by the ECtHR itself in *Lithgow*.169\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 47.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, referring to: *Siemens v.

CL-336**).\n\n146.\n\nBurlington adds that the scholarly authorities relied on by Ecuador are similarly unpersuasive. Audley Sheppard's advocacy for the abolition of *any* distinction between takings in the context of the ECT, disregards Article 31 VCLT and is unsupported by the text and structure of Article III(1) of the BIT, which makes clear that \"the elements of a lawful expropriation are cumulative and of equal importance\".170 And while Brownlie speaks of the failure to pay compensation as unlawful *sub modo*, he acknowledges that any expropriation in breach of a treaty provision is illegal *per se*.171\n\nReply, \u00b6 55, referring to: A. Sheppard, \"The distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation\", in *Investment Arbitration and the Energy Charter Treaty*, JurisNet LLC, 2006, p. 171 (**Exh. EL-259**). Burlington also argues that Sheppard is effectively re-pleading in his article a position that he had advocated on behalf of the Respondent in *ADC* and that was explicitly and forcefully rejected by the Tribunal in that case.\n\nReply, \u00b6 55, note 65, referring to: Ian Brownlie, *The Rule Of Law In International Affairs: International Law At The Fiftieth Anniversary Of The United Nations* (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1998), p. 143 (**Exh. CL-154**).\n\n147.\n\nIn any event, argues Burlington, Ecuador's arguments are ultimately irrelevant, since the expropriation failed to satisfy *any* of the four criteria set out in Article III(1) of the BIT.172\n\ni. First, it served no public purpose. The Tribunal found that Burlington had just cause to suspend operations. It also held that evidence did not support the contention that suspension created significant risks. Since Ecuador violated its own laws, no *legitimate* public purpose was served by the taking.173\n\nii. Second, the taking was discriminatory.174 Ecuador offered compensation to other oil companies, but not to Burlington.\n\niii. Third, Ecuador admits that it did not offer compensation.175\n\niv. Fourth, no due process of law was followed, there being no reasonable advance notice, no fair hearing, and no unbiased and impartial adjudicator.176 In fact, Ecuador, through President Correa, admitted that Decree 662 was a \"pressuring\" measure intended to force investors to abandon their contracts.177 Ecuador also failed to abide by order on provisional measures set out in PO1 by persisting with the *coactiva* process, thus violating Burlington's procedural rights.178 According to Burlington, \"[a]n expropriation effected through the violation of an investor's procedural rights and flouting the orders of an international tribunal cannot be found consistent with due process of law\".179\n\nv. Finally, the expropriation also breached the FET standard of Article II(3) of the BIT, which is expressly incorporated into Article III(1) of the BIT.180 Specifically, Ecuador breached the FET standard by failing to respect due process, as well as through its conduct leading up to the expropriation, which \"nullified by sovereign action Burlington's core rights\",181 as recognized by the Tribunal. By finding that Burlington had \"just cause\" to suspend operations, the Tribunal \"perforce\" recognized that the taking \"was linked with, and premised upon, State conduct\" violating Article II(3) of the BIT.182 In particular, the refusal to absorb Law 42 and the seizures, \"were necessary links in the chain that ultimately led to the formal expropriation\".183\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 57-71.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 61.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 62, also referring to: *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v.

Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n149.\n\nEcuador contends that the applicable standard of compensation is not found in customary international law, but in Article III(1) itself, which provides:\n\n\"Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable and be freely transferable\".186\n\nArticle III(1) of the Treaty.\n\n150.\n\nAs a result, in the Respondent's submission, Burlington is only entitled to the fair market value of its investment, valued on the date of expropriation, plus interest from the date of the taking.\n\n151.\n\nEcuador's primary case is that this standard applies to all expropriations, whether lawful or unlawful, and regardless of the breach giving rise to the unlawfulness.187 Ecuador argues that Burlington is wrong to contend that the simple failure to pay compensation inexorably leads to a standard of compensation different from the one in the BIT. Burlington's cited authorities do not support that proposition, nor does the text of the Treaty lead to such a result. As *Funnekotter* makes clear, case law \"is not perfectly clear\" as to whether the treaty standard of compensation does or does not apply in cases of unlawful expropriation, \"particularly in case of lack of compensation\".188 The Iran-US Claims Tribunal, and in particular the views expressed by Judge Brower, show that the treaty standard, not customary international law, was applied in cases of expropriation that was lawful save for the lack of compensation.189 Audley Sheppard has opined that \"in the absence of clear language to the contrary\", the treaty standard is applicable in all cases of expropriation, whether lawful or not.190 This position has been adopted in a \"long line of cases\", such as *Wena*, *Middle East Cement*, *Tecmed*, *Goetz*, *Rumeli*, *CME*, *Sistem* in a BIT context (where there was no material difference between the BIT language in those cases and here), and *Metalclad* or *SD Myers* in the NAFTA context.191\n\nEcuador relies on *Funnekotter v.

Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 249:2-8 (Opening, Silva Romero).\n\nTr.

Relying on *Chorz\u00f4w*, Ecuador contends that \"[t]he remedial response to an unlawful taking differs under customary international law depending on whether the taking would have been lawful \u2018but for' the payment of compensation\".198 Where (as here) an expropriation would have been lawful if compensation had been paid, the State's obligation is \"limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of the dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment\".199\n\nCM, \u00b6 353.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 357; Tr.

CL-102**).\n\n155.\n\nEcuador denies that the expropriation can be characterized as unlawful for other violations of Article III(1), as Burlington alleges. First, the Tribunal has found that it has no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to address Burlington's claim based on fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary impairment and full protection and security, which are premised on the legal notions of \"public purpose\", \"discrimination\", \"due process of law\", \"fairness\" and \"equity\". Burlington cannot now reintroduce these claims through the back door.200\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 386-387.\n\n156.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal has already dismissed Burlington's allegations. In the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal considered the same allegations that Burlington now seeks to repeat, but declared that Ecuador's purported expropriation was unlawful solely on the basis of lack of compensation. This means that the Tribunal did not accept Burlington's allegations that the expropriation had breached other conditions of Article III(1). No other conclusion can be drawn from the Tribunal's silence. The dispositive section of the Decision on Liability confirms that Burlington's other allegations regarding the unlawfulness of the expropriation were dismissed.201\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 388-391, citing: DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 541-545 and 546 (C) 1 and 2.\n\n157.\n\nThird, Burlington has not filed a motion for reconsideration on these counts.\n\n158.\n\nLastly, if, *par impossible*, the Tribunal should decide to enter into the merits of Burlington's alternative case, it should dismiss it for the following reasons:\n\ni. Ecuador has demonstrated through its Motion for Reconsideration that under Ecuadorian law it was entitled to take over Blocks 7 and 21, given the risks identified in the Consortium's Suspension Plan (among other documents).202\n\nii. There is no evidence on record to support the allegation that the expropriation was discriminatory. The other companies referred to by Burlington as having received compensation from Ecuador were not in the same circumstances as Burlington, in particular because they accepted to renegotiate their oil contracts, migrate them to service contracts and pay Law 42 taxes, whereas Burlington did not.203\n\niii. While it is undisputed that Burlington has not received compensation for Ecuador's purported expropriation, it is also undisputed that, had Burlington not torpedoed the Consortium's negotiations with Ecuador, the Consortium would have entered into transitory agreements with the State and eventually either continued to operate the Blocks under service contracts, or discussed with the State the liquidation of the PSCs, which under Ecuador's new hydrocarbon legal framework would have led to compensation. That being said, Ecuador emphasizes that Burlington is owed no compensation in accordance with Article 75 of the Hydrocarbons Law and the Caducidad Decrees.204\n\niv. Finally, there is no evidence on record showing that Ecuador's purported expropriation was carried out in violation of due process or any of the elements in Article II(3). It is untenable for Burlington to have abandoned the oilfields and then allege that the State, which had no choice but to intervene in the Blocks, did not follow a \"process of law\". In any event Ecuador followed the procedure for emergency situations.205 According to Ecuador, Burlington also ignores five relevant facts:206\n\na. The Consortium (as recognized by the *Perenco* tribunal) failed to provide the State with the economic study required for the tax renegotiation clauses to be triggered. It was thus the Consortium's own fault if the Parties did not follow the contractual procedure foreseen in Clauses 11.12 and 15.2 of the PSC for Block 7 or Clauses 11.7 and 15.2 of the PSC for Block 21.207\n\nb. Ecuador considered, in accordance with the ICSID Convention, that the provisional measures adopted in PO1 were \"mere recommendations and, hence, not binding upon the State\".208 According to Ecuador, \"[n]o breach of due process of law may occur for not following some recommendations. If, however, those provisional measures were to be considered binding upon Ecuador (*quod non*), their breach does not entail a violation of any of the elements (right of defense, equality of the parties, etc.) forming the due process of law principle\".209\n\nc. Ecuador invited the Consortium several times to resume operations in the Blocks, without success. Burlington's reaction was disproportionate in the circumstances.210\n\nd. The internal rate of return offered by Ecuador for the service contracts was the same as the one implied in the economy of the PSCs,211 and\n\ne. If due process of law was violated by Ecuador's purported expropriation, Burlington was entitled to request remedies from Ecuadorian administrative courts, which it chose not to do.212\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 394, referring to: CM, \u00b6\u00b6 88-167.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 395-396.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 397.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 398.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n159.\n\nFor these reasons, Ecuador argues that \"Burlington's renewed attempt to circumvent the Tribunal's jurisdiction and findings on liability should be given short shrift\".213\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 399.\n\n3. **Analysis**\n---------------\n\n160.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the appropriate standard of compensation in this case is the customary international law standard of full reparation. Article III(1) only describes the conditions under which an expropriation is considered lawful; it does not set out the standard of compensation for expropriations resulting from breaches of the Treaty. This conclusion has been reaffirmed in a number of cases where the treaty in question had similar language.214 The authorities cited by Ecuador in this regard are unpersuasive: it is clear in this case that the Treaty provides the primary rules of international law, i.e., the State's substantive obligations, and not the secondary rules, i.e., those that determine the State's responsibility for breach of those obligations. In the absence of such a secondary rule in the Treaty, the Tribunal must turn to customary international law.\n\nSee, for instance: *Siemens v. Argentina,* Award of 6 February 2007, \u00b6 349 (**Exh. C-79**) (\"The law applicable to the determination of compensation for a breach of such treaty obligations is customary international law. The Treaty itself only provides for compensation for expropriation in accordance with the terms of the Treaty\"). See also: *ADC v. Hungary,* Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 483 (**Exh. CL-101**) (\"Since the BIT does not contain any *lex specialis* rules that govern the issue of the standard for assessing damages in the case of an unlawful expropriation, the Tribunal is required to apply the default standard contained in customary international law in the present case\"); *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v.

Bolivia\"),* Award of 16 September 2015, \u00b6 326.\n\n161.\n\nHowever, during the quantum phase, Ecuador has argued that the standard of compensation under customary international law is different for expropriations that are unlawful solely as a result of the failure to pay compensation as opposed to expropriations that are unlawful on other grounds.215 This is a question that was not pleaded during the liability phase and that the Decision on Liability did not address. As the conditions set out in Article III(1) of the Treaty are cumulative, in the Decision on Liability the Tribunal concluded its analysis of the lawfulness of the expropriation after having found that Ecuador had breached one of those conditions (specifically, the requirement to pay or offer compensation). This was done in the interest of procedural efficiency, not because Ecuador's failure to pay compensation was necessarily the only breach of Article III(1). At that stage, the Parties' submissions did not require the Tribunal to proceed any further with its legality analysis. This being said, given Ecuador's argument during this phase according to which the nature of the unlawfulness of an expropriation impacts the quantum of damages, the Tribunal has re-examined the Parties' arguments and evidence and concludes that Ecuador failed to comply with other conditions set by Article III(1) for a lawful expropriation.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that this is Ecuador's alternative argument (its primary case being that the treaty standard should apply).\n\n162.\n\nDoing so, contrary to Ecuador's suggestion, the Tribunal is not contradicting or reconsidering the Decision on Liability. In that Decision, the Tribunal declared that \"Ecuador breached Article III of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating Burlington's investment in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 30 August 2009\";216 it did not declare that Ecuador's expropriation was unlawful solely on the basis of lack of compensation. Likewise, the Tribunal declared that \"all different or contrary requests for relief in connection with Ecuador's liability are dismissed\";217 it did not dismiss Burlington's allegations that the expropriation was unlawful also due to other reasons. The Tribunal's finding that the expropriation was unlawful because it did not meet one of the conditions of Article III(1) of the Treaty was sufficient for its Decision on Liability. Whether or not Ecuador breached the remaining conditions of Article III(1) is now raised by Ecuador as a factor allegedly relevant to establish the standard of compensation, which is a question for the quantum phase of the proceedings, as is shown by the fact that the Parties have submitted extensive arguments on this subject in this phase. The Tribunal now turns to that question.\n\nDoL, \u00b6 546(C)(1).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 546(C)(2).\n\n163.\n\nArticle III(1) of the Treaty provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\") except: for a public purpose; in a nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3)\".\n\n164.\n\nAs this language shows, Article III(1) expressly incorporates the requirement that, to be lawful, an expropriation must be carried out in accordance with the general principles of treatment provided in Article II(3) of the Treaty, which reads as follows:\n\n\"(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\n\n(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\n\n(c) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\".\n\n165.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the combination of these two provisions means that, to be lawful, an expropriation must be carried out (i) for a public purpose; (ii) in a nondiscriminatory manner; (iii) upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation, (iv) in accordance with due process of law; (vi) in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment, including in particular the requirement that the expropriation not be arbitrary218 and that it be conducted in accordance with the minimum standard of treatment; (vii) in accordance with the principle of full protection and security, and (viii) without breaching obligations it may have entered with regard to investments.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the prohibition of arbitrary conduct is already included in the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Ecuador's argument that it has no jurisdiction to determine whether an expropriation was carried out in accordance with the general principles provided for in Article II(3). It is true that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that it had no jurisdiction over Burlington's separate fair and equitable treatment claim, arbitrary impairment claim, and full protection and security claim.219 However, it has upheld jurisdiction over Burlington's expropriation claim, and the Treaty standard expressly provides that, to be lawful, an expropriation must be carried out, *inter alia*, in accordance with the general principles contained in Article II(3). To ignore this would contradict the plain language of Article III(1) and render the phrase \"in accordance with [\u2026] the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3)\" without *effet utile*. This does not mean that Burlington may revive FET claims through the back door. The Tribunal's analysis is limited to determining whether the expropriation (which the Tribunal has found occurred when the physical takeover of the Blocks became permanent)220 was carried out in accordance with these general principles.\n\nDoJ, \u00b6 342(D).\n\nDoL, \u00b6\u00b6 530-537.\n\n167.\n\nIt arises from the record underlying the Decision on Liability and this Award that the expropriation was not carried out in accordance with the general principles of treatment provided in Article II(3). Indeed, the Tribunal finds that the expropriation was not carried out in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment, which is a condition of a lawful expropriation under Article III(1) referring to Article II(3), even under a stringent interpretation of that standard.\n\n168.\n\nThe tribunal in *Waste Management II* defined the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law (which provides the floor for the fair and equitable treatment standard) as follows:\n\n\"[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process\".221\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II,* Award of 30 April 2004, \u00b6 98 (**Exh. CL-179**).\n\n169.\n\nHaving said that, *Mondev* clarified that \"[t]o the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious\" and that \"a state may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith\".222 It also observed that \"[a] judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case\".223 The Tribunal concurs.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2 *(\"Mondev v. United States\"),* Award of 11 October 2002, \u00b6 116 (**Exh. CL-387**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 118.\n\n170.\n\nBurlington argues that \"[u]nder any reading of [the FET] standard, a state's use of its sovereign power to expropriate an investment in retribution for an investor's refusal to surrender its rights in specific legal instruments designed for, and afforded to, the investor by the state is certainly a violation thereof\".224 The Tribunal agrees. Indeed, after reviewing the totality of the circumstances that surrounded the takeover of the Blocks, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Ecuador's permanent takeover of the Blocks, which it has found to have been without justification in the law and in the facts,225 was the final step in a chain of harassment measures directed to forcing Burlington to migrate the PSCs into service contracts or abandon them altogether.\n\nSupp. Mem. on Liability, \u00b6 108.\n\nSee: DoL, \u00b6 529.\n\n171.\n\nAs recognized in *Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan*, the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment includes \"[t]he obligation not to exercise unreasonable pressure on an investor to reach certain goals\".226 While that tribunal considered that such conduct constituted a violation of due process (which is one aspect of the fair and equitable treatment standard), other tribunals have considered that such harassment violated the fair and equitable treatment or minimum standards of treatment more generally. For instance, the *Tecmed* tribunal found that the state agency's denial of a license extension was \"a means to pressure [the investor] and force it to assume a similar operation in another site, bearing the costs and risks of a new business\", and that \"[u]nder such circumstances, such pressure involve[d] forms of coercion that may be considered inconsistent with the fair and equitable treatment\" standard.227\n\n*Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan*, Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability of 2 September 2009, \u00b6 221 (**Exh. CL-361**). The Tribunal notes that this tribunal considered this to be a form of violation of due process.\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico,* Award of 29 May 2003, \u00b6 163 (**Exh. EL-23**).\n\n172.\n\nHere, the record shows that Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks was the final step in a series of acts of harassment directed against Burlington in order to force it to renegotiate the PSCs. As reported in the Ecuadorian press, President Correa stated that Decree 662, which increased the Law 42 dues to 99%, \"was only a \u2018pressuring measure' for the parties to sit down to negotiate\".228 Ecuador has not disputed this. Indeed, in the context of its analysis of whether Law 42 was expropriatory, the Tribunal noted that \"Ecuador argue[d] that Law 42 was intended to prompt oil companies to negotiate with the State\".229 It reasoned that \"[w]hile this goal may have been related to Ecuador's view that the allocation of oil revenues under the PSCs was unfair, it provides no ground to disregard Burlington's rights under the PSCs\",230 adding that \"Ecuador appear[ed] to have passed Law 42 without intending to apply the correction factor required by the tax absorption clauses of the PSCs\", which \"len[t] credence to Burlington's allegation that Law 42 was intended to force Burlington to abdicate its rights under the PSCs\".231\n\n**Exh. C-182**.\n\nDoL, \u00b6 455.\n\n*Ibid*\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n173.\n\nIn this context, it bears repeating that the Tribunal has found that \"by enacting Law 42 and then refusing to absorb its effect pursuant to the tax absorption clauses, Ecuador has in effect nullified Burlington's right to a correction factor by preventing the exercise of this right. Moreover, this nullification was made possible through the use of Ecuador's sovereign powers. While both parties to the PSCs may invoke the tax absorption clauses, only Ecuador, as a sovereign State, may increase taxes and disregard this clause\".232 While this conduct may not have had an expropriatory effect, it undoubtedly had an impact on Burlington's business. Seen together with President Correa's statements quoted above, it confirms that Ecuador was using its sovereign powers to pressure Burlington into negotiating.\n\nDoL, \u00b6 418.\n\n174.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has dismissed the argument of a creeping expropriation, it did so because the physical takeover of the Blocks constituted an expropriation in and of itself.233 That does not preclude the Tribunal from assessing whether the expropriation was carried out in accordance with fair and equitable treatment. This assessment cannot take place in a vacuum; it involves reviewing the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the expropriation. Having done so, the Tribunal holds that Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks was carried out in breach of the principle of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 538.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that none of Ecuador's additional arguments justifies the conduct in breach of FET in the course of the expropriation:\n\ni. Ecuador first argues that (as recognized by the *Perenco* tribunal), the Consortium failed to provide the State with the economic study required for the tax renegotiation clauses to be triggered and, as a result, it was the Consortium's own fault if the Parties did not follow the contractual procedure foreseen in the PSCs. The findings of the *Perenco* tribunal are not binding on the present Tribunal, but even if they were, the fact that the contractual procedure for the application of the correction factor was not triggered would not justify the adoption of pressuring measures to force an investor to renegotiate or give up its investment.\n\nii. Ecuador's arguments with respect to its failure to comply with the Tribunal's provisional measures are irrelevant in this context, as indeed are Burlington's. While Ecuador's failure to comply with the Tribunal's provisional measures could have breached Burlington's procedural rights, it does not in itself involve a violation of due process with respect to the expropriation.\n\niii. As to Ecuador's allegation that the Consortium refused to resume operations despite Ecuador's invitation to do so, in its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that Minister Pinto's letter of 19 August 2009, in which Ecuador urged the Consortium to resume operations within a maximum period of 10 days, was \"inconsistent with Burlington's right to suspend operations with \u2018just cause' on account of Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs and of [the] provisional measures order\" and, as a result, \"Burlington had no obligation to accept Ecuador's demand\".234 In any event, Ecuador's account is incorrect: as recorded in the Decision on Liability, on 28 August 2009, the Consortium answered that it \"would be prepared to resume\" operations provided that Ecuador brought itself into compliance with its legal and contractual obligations, and there is no evidence that Ecuador responded to this letter or further communicated with the Consortium in this regard.235\n\niv. Whether the internal rate of return offered by Ecuador for the service contracts was the same as that implied in the economy of the PSCs is irrelevant as regards fair and equitable treatment or due process.\n\nDoL, \u00b6 533, referring to: **Exh. C-223**. More specifically, the Tribunal found that \"[a]s Ecuador had by that time neither cured those breaches nor expressed an intent to do so, Burlington still had \u2018just cause' to suspend operations. In other words, the *status quo* at the time of this demand was no different from that which had given rise to Burlington's right to suspend operations with \u2018just cause' to begin with\". DoL, \u00b6 533.\n\nDoL, \u00b6 534, referring to: **Exh. C-224**.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal thus reaches the conclusion that the expropriation was unlawful not only for failure to pay compensation. As a result, it can dispense with determining whether the standard of compensation under customary international law is different for expropriations that are unlawful solely as a result of the failure to pay compensation as opposed to expropriations that are unlawful on other grounds.\n\n177.\n\nThe appropriate standard of compensation is thus the customary international law standard of full reparation set out in Article 31 of the ILC Articles, applied by analogy. While Part Two of the ILC Articles, which sets out the legal consequences of internationally wrongful acts and to which Article 31 belongs, is not applicable to the international responsibility of States vis-\u00e0-vis non-States,236 it is generally accepted that the ILC Articles can be transposed to the context of investor-State disputes.237 ILC Article 31 provides that \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\". Pursuant to this principle, first articulated in the landmark *Chorz\u00f4w* case, \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".238\n\nSee: ILC Article 33(2), and commentary (3) to Article 28.\n\nSee, for instance: *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C.

The PCIJ also noted that \"[t]he calculation of a lump sum referred to above [the value of the undertaking] concerns only the Chorz\u00f4w undertaking, and does not exclude the possibility of taking into account other damage which the Companies may have sustained owing to dispossession, but which is outside the undertaking itself\". *Chorz\u00f4w*, p. 49.

CL-173**) (\"In my view *Chorz\u00f4w Factory* presents a simple scheme: If an expropriation is lawful, the deprived party is to be awarded damages equal to the \u2018value of the undertaking' which it has lost, including any potential future profits, as of the date of the taking; in the case of an unlawful taking, however, either the injured party is to be actually restored to enjoyment of his property, or, should this be impossible or impractical, he is to be awarded damages equal to the greater of (i) the value of the undertaking at the date of loss (again including lost profits), judged on the basis of information available as of that date, and (ii) its value (likewise including lost profits) as shown by its probable performance subsequent to the date of loss and prior to the date of the award, based on actual post taking experience, plus (in either alternative) any consequential damage\").\n\n**C. Categories of Compensable Losses**\n---------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nApplying the relevant standard of compensation, Burlington is entitled to full reparation for the losses resulting from Ecuador's unlawful expropriation of its investment.\n\n179.\n\nAs anticipated in Section A above, Burlington claims three categories of losses: (i) past Law 42 dues paid or seized (what the Claimant's expert Compass Lexecon calls \"pre-expropriation tax debts\"); (ii) its lost profits under the PSCs (what Compass Lexecon calls the \"value of the operating assets\"), and (iii) the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC (what Compass Lexecon calls the \"value of Block 7 extension\").\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal will first determine whether Burlington is entitled to each of the heads of damages it seeks (this Section B), starting with the past Law 42 dues (Section 1 below), followed by the value of Burlington's operating assets (Section 2 below), and ending with Burlington's claim for the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC (Section 3 below). If it determines that any of these categories of claims constitutes a compensable loss, it will discuss its valuation in Section C below.\n\n**1. Past Law 42 dues**\n-----------------------\n\n**1.1 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n181.\n\nBurlington claims that it is entitled \"to recover damages equal to all Law 42 amounts paid under protest or extracted in kind through the *coactiva* seizures\",239 which Burlington characterizes as \"lost contract rights\" and Compass Lexecon refers to as \"pre-expropriation tax debts\". In the Updated Model, using Compass Lexecon's assumptions this claim is quantified at **UsD 298,639,960**, including pre-award interest. Burlington puts forth five main arguments in this respect.\n\nReply, \u00b6 108.\n\n182.\n\nFirst, Burlington contends that these lost contract rights were assets that were expropriated and, as such, for which it must be compensated. According to Burlington, when Ecuador expropriated its investment, it \"took everything of value relating to Burlington's investments in Blocks 7 and 21, including Burlington's contractual rights\".240 In particular, says Burlington, Ecuador took its right under the PSCs to have a correction factor applied to absorb the effects of Law 42, a right that the Tribunal found to be \"part and parcel\" of Burlington's investment.241 For Burlington, this right was a protection against both past and future taxes. As a result, \"by unlawfully expropriating the PSCs, Ecuador not only deprived Burlington of its future rights under those contracts, *it also deprived Burlington of its acquired rights \u2013 the right to be indemnified by Ecuador for the sums paid and seized under Law 42* \".242 Burlington adds that \"Ecuador cannot be permitted to wipe out its own debts by unlawfully expropriating the contracts pursuant to which those debts are owed\".243\n\nMem., \u00b6 93.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 93, citing: DoL, \u00b6 405.\n\nMem., \u00b6 94 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 94.\n\n183.\n\nAccording to Burlington, the Decision on Liability confirms that past Law 42 dues were expropriated. The Decision on Liability found that the investment had to be viewed \"as a whole\" and not as discrete parts. It also found that the entire investment had been expropriated, as it did not specify that there were parts of the investment that were not taken. As a result, the Tribunal must now value that investment \"as a whole\".244\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1386:11-1388:18 (Closing, Coriell), referring to: DoL, \u00b6 257.\n\n184.\n\nThe Decision on Liability also confirms, says Burlington, that the Claimant lost everything that constituted its investment, including all of its rights related to the investment. The Tribunal expressly found that \"[w]hile Burlington still had its subsidiary's rights in the PSCs as well as the subsidiary's shares, these rights and shares had no value without possession of the oilfields and access to the oil\", and that \"[e]ven though these contract rights were still nominally in force after the takeover [\u2026], they were bereft of any real value from the moment Burlington permanently lost effective use and control of its investment\", which according to the Tribunal occurred when Ecuador entered the oilfields and physically occupied the Blocks, a situation that became permanent on 30 August 2009.245\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1388:19-1395:14 (Closing, Coriell), referring to: DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 530531, 536.\n\n185.\n\nIn addition, Burlington continues, the Decision on Liability confirms that what was expropriated was \"not a simple accrued debt\", but \"a contractual adjustment that requires a contractual mechanism\".246 Specifically, when discussing the content of the tax absorption clause and the impact of Law 42 on the PSCs, the Tribunal considered that the parties jointly were required to calculate the readjustment and that \"Law 42 trigger[ed] the contractual mechanism applicable in the event of a modification to the tax system\", that is, an administrative procedure providing for \"the mandatory application of a correction factor\", which Burlington argues is a contractual mechanism that arose from and depended on the existence of the PSC.247 Ecuador was required to apply this contractual mechanism but failed to do so, and so breached the PSC. On the date of the expropriation, Ecuador was still under an obligation to apply this mechanism. However, when the PSCs were expropriated, the means by which Burlington could enforce that mechanism was also expropriated. For Burlington, \"the expropriation and the failure to apply the correction factor and the contractual mechanism to get it were inextricably linked\".248 The right to a mechanism to obtain that correction factor was \"wrapped up\" in the investment in and the operation of the Blocks, which were lost with the seizure of the oilfields on 30 August 2009. As found by the Tribunal, the right remained only \"nominally\" in existence (given that *caducidad* would not be declared until almost one year later), \"bereft of any real value\", as the means to obtain the \"mandatory\" correction was gone. Although Burlington may not have needed access to the oil to obtain its past Law 42 payments, it certainly needed the PSCs themselves.249\n\nTr.

Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1394:22-1396:16 (Closing, Coriell).\n\n186.\n\nAs a result, the Claimant submits that its claim for indemnification for past Law 42 dues forms part of the expropriated investment. This was the approach taken by the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, which held that, because Venezuela had expropriated the claimant's enterprise \"as a whole, by assuming control in fact of its business and all of its assets\", \"the investment that was lost must include outstanding unpaid accounts receivable\".250\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 91, citing: *Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 (\" *Tidewater v. Venezuela* \"), Award of March 13, 2015, \u00b6 175 (**Exh. EL-422**).\n\n187.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant contends that \"international law likewise requires that the value of Burlington's \u2018investment' includes the value of any accrued payments that Ecuador owed to Burlington as of the date of expropriation, the right to which was seized along with the Blocks\".251 Relying on *Tidewater*, *Siemens*, and *Tippets*, among other decisions, Burlington argues that international tribunals routinely compensate expropriated parties for unpaid services or accrued debts. The contrary would in fact create perverse incentives as States would be permitted to wipe out accrued contractual liabilities through expropriation.252 Likewise, relying on *Phillips Petroleum, American International Group* and *Azurix*, Burlington argues that tribunals exclude from the calculation of compensation any diminution of value resulting from prior wrongful acts by the State related to the expropriation or to the enterprise at issue.253\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 98.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 96-100; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 100-103.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 104-108; Tr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 89:9-92:17 (Opening, Coriell).\n\n188.\n\nBurlington's second argument in favor of compensation for past Law 42 dues is that since its contractual rights were nullified by sovereign action, the effects of Ecuador's conduct must be wiped out. Burlington recalls that in the Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal held that a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard could only occur if Ecuador had acted in its sovereign capacity.254 Then, in its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal held that Ecuador's failure to honor the tax absorption clause was a measure taken in the exercise of its sovereign powers.255 Accordingly, the failure to absorb the effects of Law 42 was \"an internationally wrongful act involving Ecuador's sovereign power\".256\n\nMem., \u00b6 101, citing: DoJ, \u00b6 204.\n\nMem., \u00b6 102, citing: DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 418-419 (\"this nullification was made possible through the use of Ecuador's sovereign powers\" and \"only Ecuador, as a sovereign State, may increase taxes and disregard this clause\").\n\nMem., \u00b6 105.\n\n189.\n\nThis is relevant, says Burlington, because Article III(1) of the Treaty incorporates a requirement that expropriations be carried out in a fair and equitable manner.257 The Tribunal's findings confirm that the expropriation did not meet that requirement, as it was preceded by sovereign acts nullifying Burlington's \"core rights\".258 Burlington notes that Ecuador itself acknowledged that Law 42 was part of a \"plan to induce foreign investors to abandon their rights\".259 Burlington also points to *Occidental II*, where the tribunal held that Law 42 breached the PSC and the investor's legitimate expectations, thus violating the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT.260\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 106.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 107.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 109, referring to: Burlington's Memorial on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 221-256.\n\nMem., \u00b6 104, citing: *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

CL-240**).\n\n190.\n\nThird, Burlington pleads that its position is consistent with the fact that the Tribunal's jurisdiction only covers Treaty breaches. It explains that \"[t]he conduct for which Burlington claims relief is not a breach of contract but the destruction of contract rights by sovereign action, [\u2026] the nullification of such rights\", which \"must be by its essence a treaty claim because only a sovereign can destroy contractual rights by its action\".261 Burlington claims no more than the value of the PSCs that were unlawfully expropriated, and a significant part of that value is the accrued right to reimbursement for Law 42 payments and seizures that occurred prior to the expropriation.262 This does not mean that this is a contract claim; it is a matter of determining the value of the expropriated investment.263\n\nTr.

Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 63:10-14 (Opening, Blackaby).\n\n191.\n\nEcuador fails to realize, argues Burlington, that arbitral tribunals routinely include the value of lost contract rights when valuing expropriated assets even when those tribunals were not presented with the contract claims themselves or lacked jurisdiction over contract claims.264 For instance, in *Tippetts*, the tribunal had no jurisdiction over the contract which was the source of the right to claimed debts, but nonetheless included unpaid invoices in its valuation.265 The same occurred in *SPP v. Egypt* as well as in arbitrations arising from the Argentine debt crisis.266 \"This did not mean [\u2026] that the Tribunals in those cases were entertaining contract claims [...]. Rather, they simply recognized that most investments are comprised of a bundle of contractual rights and that international breaches by States are frequently aimed at the destruction of those rights or the impact on the value of those rights\".267\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 98-104, referring to: *Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton (TAMS) v.

Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 64:6-14 (Opening, Blackaby).\n\n192.\n\nAs a fourth element, Burlington opposes Ecuador's contention that this claim is barred as a consequence of Burlington's so-called waiver of contract rights in this arbitration. Burlington primarily advances the following arguments in support:\n\ni. Ecuador confuses contract and treaty claims. Burlington seeks compensation for these sums \"as part of the value of its investment on the date of expropriation\", not to pursue contractual indemnification.268\n\nii. Further, although it withdrew its right to pursue a claim under the PSCs, Burlington did not waive the underlying right to be compensated for Law 42 payments. The Tribunal has already found that Burlington only waived the possibility of re-filing its claims under the PSCs, but did not waive its underlying rights, and can thus rely on them to pursue its treaty claims.269 This is confirmed by Ecuadorian law: in his expert report, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose explains that Ecuadorian law distinguishes between substantive legal rights and \"procedural vehicles that convey those rights\", differentiating between (a) an underlying substantive right, (b) a right of action, (c) a claim, and (d) a legal action.270 The withdrawal of a legal action or claim in no way destroys the substantive right.271 Furthermore, Ecuador's position squares poorly with case law holding that an investor cannot \u2013 even explicitly \u2013 waive its substantive treaty rights; it can only waive its procedural rights.272 Finally, it is undisputed that on 30 August 2009, \"the dispositive date for identifying the expropriated assets\", Burlington possessed the contractual right to tax absorption.273\n\niii. Moreover, Burlington argues that the contract claims of the Burlington Subsidiaries274 were withdrawn *as a result of* the expropriation, since they had become \"superfluous\".275 From then on, Burlington sought to recover the value of its tax absorption rights forming part of its investment as part of its expropriation case, rather than as a stand-alone claim for damages. The withdrawal of Burlington's contract claims is irrelevant for purposes of valuing the expropriated investment because, \"but for\" the expropriation, Burlington would not have waived its right to file the contract claim.276 Tribunals have shown themselves to be reluctant to question strategic litigation decisions, and properly so. Be this as it may, what matters here is that Burlington clarified in written statements to the Tribunal and Ecuador that the withdrawal of its contract claims was predicated on Ecuador's conduct.277 Burlington emphasizes that, \"[h]aving agreed that the conclusion that led to Burlington's withdrawal of the claim was correct, namely that Burlington was faced with an unlawful expropriation, the Tribunal cannot be asked to penalize Burlington through its damages valuation for something that would not have occurred but for Ecuador's unlawful conduct\".278\n\niv. Finally, Burlington argues that it is in any event entitled to indemnity against the effects of Law 42 arising *after* the withdrawal of its contract claims, since the withdrawal could only apply to existing claims arising from Ecuador's prewithdrawal conduct, not to potential future claims arising from its postwithdrawal conduct. That is, even if the Tribunal considered that the withdrawal gave rise to some form of waiver of Burlington's substantive rights (*quod non*), it would still have to ignore the effects of Law 42 after the date of the withdrawal. This is because a breach of Burlington's contractual rights occurring after that date would justify new claims by Burlington or any purchaser of the investment. Burlington contends that it would make no sense to allow Ecuador to profit \"from future unlawful acts by erasing the future value of the tax absorption clauses based on (at the very most) a waiver of claims for past breaches\".279 For a prospective buyer, the tax absorption clauses of the PSCs would include \"tremendous future value\" irrespective of a withdrawal of any *pre-existing* contract claims.280 As noted above, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose explains that Ecuadorian law provides that a withdrawal of a legal action entails the loss of the right to refile that same legal action, not future legal actions, and in any case does not affect the underlying substantive rights, which continue to form part of the assets.281\n\nv. Fifth and last, Burlington denies that the contract rights that give rise to its claim for past Law 42 dues are disputed, as Ecuador alleges. In its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal determined the meaning of the tax absorption clauses and that determination is binding: \"So, the dispute, to the extent there was one, has been resolved, and it's been resolved in Burlington's favor\".282\n\nReply, \u00b6 110.\n\nTr.

Its primary submission is that these are contract claims which Burlington now seeks to reintroduce through the back door and over which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Alternatively, Ecuador argues that this claim is inadmissible because it pertains to the vindication of contract rights that are disputed by the Parties. In the further alternative, it submits that this claim fails on the merits because (i) these are credits that do not form part of the expropriated assets and are still held by the Contract Claimants,283 and (ii) in any event, the Contract Claimants have waived their entitlement to enforce their contractual right for indemnification against Law 42 payments.\n\nAs that term is defined in Freshfields' letter of 18 September 2009, namely, Burlington Resources Inc., Burlington Resources Oriente Limited, Burlington Resources Andean Limited and Burlington Resources Ecuador Limited.\n\n194.\n\nIt is Ecuador's primary case that Burlington's claims related to Law 42 (including Burlington's claim for its accrued right to receive reimbursement for payments made under Law 42 or *coactiva* seizures) are contract claims and not treaty claims. As a result, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over these claims.284\n\nEcuador also raises the arguments summarized later in this section, in response to Burlington's submissions related to the future impact of Law 42 on its lost profits claim.\n\n195.\n\nAs a general matter, Ecuador argues that all of Burlington's claims related to Law 42 payments (whether past or future) are contractual in nature. Burlington attempts to circumvent the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction by disguising these claims as treaty claims, when in fact they rest entirely on the PSCs.285 For Ecuador, contract and treaty claims have \"different legal bases and give rise to separate legal analysis, with distinct tests and applicable rules\", as recognized in case law and doctrine.286 As confirmed in *Pantechniki*, the key to the distinction is the \"normative source\" from which the different types of claims derive and the assessment whether a claim \"truly does have an autonomous existence outside the contract\".287 Awards and scholarly writings have confirmed that an objective test must be adopted, meaning that tribunals are not bound by the parties' characterization of the legal foundation of their claims.288 Here, the legal foundation of Burlington's Law 42 claims reveals that they are contractual in nature.289\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 320.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 321-323, referring to: *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (\" *Vivendi v.

These claims are identical to its previous contract claims to enforce the tax renegotiation clauses in the PSCs, as the Tribunal already found in its Decision on Jurisdiction (\"this claim revolves around a contract matter, not a \u2018matter of taxation'\").290 They have the \"same factual predicates, the same legal basis, and seek the same relief\" as the contract claims put forward by Burlington's Subsidiaries and as Burlington's umbrella clause claim.291 Whereas the Subsidiaries withdrew their contract claims and the Tribunal dismissed the umbrella clause claim, Burlington now seeks to reintroduce these same claims through the back door. If the Tribunal puts Burlington in the pecuniary position in which it would have been if the tax renegotiation had been performed, it will in effect uphold a contract claim.292\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 326, citing: DoJ, \u00b6 181.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 327-329.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 338.\n\n197.\n\nAs the Contract Claimants are no longer parties to the arbitration, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Burlington's contract claims.293 For Ecuador, these claims must be dismissed because (i) contract claims cannot be entertained by the Tribunal if the Parties to the proceedings are not also parties to the contract, (ii) the Tribunal already held that Burlington may not rely on the umbrella clause to enforce its Subsidiaries' contract claims, and (ii) while the Tribunal considered disputed contract rights as facts, it cannot take into consideration the value of those disputed rights to determine the amount of damages, since this would effectively mean granting Burlington's contract claims.294\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 346-362.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n198.\n\nBurlington's alleged fairness considerations cannot override the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction.295 As Professor Stern acknowledged in her dissent in *Occidental*, there is nothing unjust if Burlington is not entitled to compensation for contract claims due to the limited jurisdiction of the Tribunal.296 If anything, granting Burlington's contract claims would be \"unfair and unjust\", since these claims were withdrawn with prejudice at a time when Burlington was expected to file its response to Ecuador's objections to jurisdiction (including jurisdiction over the contract claims).297\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 363-369.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 368, referring to: *Occidental v.

With respect to (ii), according to Ecuador, \"there is undeniably a genuine dispute between the Parties as to the existence and scope of Burlington's alleged contract rights purportedly affected by Law 42\",300 as recognized in the Decision on Liability.301\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 370. Ecuador advances this argument for all claims related to Law 42, as well as for the claim for lost opportunity to extend Block 7.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 371, citing: Z.

In both instances, the treaty tribunal lacks jurisdiction to resolve the contractual dispute, which must be resolved by a different tribunal\".303 While in most cases, the treaty tribunal can generally stay the proceedings and await the determination by another tribunal mandated to determine the parties' contract claims, this is not an option here because the contract claims are not pending before any tribunal, nor can they ever be, since the possibility of refiling these claims was waived with prejudice.304\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 377.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 378.\n\n201.\n\nFaced with Burlington's argument that the Tribunal has already resolved the dispute between the Parties regarding these contract rights, Ecuador acknowledges that \"the Tribunal made some dicta in their [sic] Decision on Liability regarding the effect of the renegotiation clauses, but we all know this very distinguished tribunal doesn't have jurisdiction over Contract Claims\". Ecuador contends that, as a result, \"[t]here cannot be any Decision, any adjudication whatsoever, in the Decision on Liability or elsewhere on the Contract claims\", as a result of which these rights are still disputed.305\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1479:22-1480:10 (Closing, Silva Romero).\n\n202.\n\nIn a further alternative, in the event that the Tribunal were to hold that it has jurisdiction over Burlington's claim for Law 42 payments and that this claim is admissible, Ecuador is of the view that the claim fails on its merits for two main reasons.\n\n203.\n\nFirst, the rights for which Burlington seeks compensation were never expropriated.306 Ecuador notes that, because the Tribunal dismissed its fair and equitable treatment and umbrella clause claims and found that Law 42 was not an expropriation, the Claimant effectively has no choice but to argue that Burlington Oriente's acquired right to tax absorption is part of the expropriated investment. This argument fails because, as a matter of fact, Ecuador did not take these past contract rights when it expropriated Burlington's investment. The Tribunal deemed the expropriation to have occurred on 30 August 2009 when Ecuador's physical takeover of the Blocks became permanent. As a consequence, from that day forward the PSCs could not be a source of profit for Burlington. In other words, \"[w]hat Ecuador took was the right to, in the future, explore and exploit the oilfields, keep a share of the oil and sell it for its profit. It did not take any other asset of Burlington Oriente\".307 According to Ecuador, paragraphs 530308 and 536309 of the Decision on Liability confirm that \"the rights which had crystallized before Burlington lost control of the Blocks [were] not affected by the takeover\".310\n\nTr.

Such dispossession deprived Burlington not only of its oil production share \u2013 and thus of its revenues \u2013 but also of the means of production that made those revenues possible. In a nutshell, the occupation of the Blocks deprived Burlington of all the tangible property embodying its investment in Ecuador. While Burlington still had its subsidiary's rights in the PSCs as well as the subsidiary's shares, these rights and shares had no value without possession of the oil fields and access to the oil\").\n\nDoL, \u00b6 536 (\"Even though these contract rights were still nominally in force after the takeover \u2013 as *caducidad* would not be declared until almost a year later, in July 2010 \u2013, they were bereft of any real value from the moment Burlington permanently lost effective use and control of its investment\").\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 236:3-5 (Opening, Mayer).\n\n204.\n\nEcuador emphasizes that it did not expropriate Burlington Oriente as a company with all its assets; it only expropriated the PSCs. Burlington Oriente retained its other assets, and in particular its credits.311 This is confirmed by the fact that Burlington has repeatedly stated in this arbitration that it still holds its contract rights.312\n\nTr.

Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 232:18-234:15 (Opening, Mayer).\n\n205.\n\nBurlington's argument that what was expropriated in this regard was a contractual mechanism, as opposed to a simple debt, also fails. Burlington ignores that \"when a contract terminates, termination is not retroactive, and a court or an arbitral tribunal can still apply its clauses to obligations that had appeared before termination\".313 At the time of the expropriation, Burlington had a right to specific performance of these pre-existing contractual obligations and, as Ecuador refused to perform, it had a right to damages to replace that specific performance. In Ecuador's submission, this right to damages stems from the non-performance of a contractual obligation that predates the expropriation; \"[e]xpropriation has nothing to do with i t\".314\n\nTr.

Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1507:14-1508:10 (Closing, Mayer).\n\n206.\n\nAs a result, because Burlington's right to be reimbursed for past Law 42 dues was not expropriated, Burlington does not have a treaty claim for these rights; only a contract claim over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.315\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 234:13-17 (Opening, Mayer).\n\n207.\n\nThe second reason why this claim must fail on the merits in Ecuador's opinion is that it is a contract claim which Burlington has withdrawn and can thus no longer raise. On 10 October 2009, the Burlington Subsidiaries withdrew \"with prejudice\" their claims to recover Law 42 payments. The consequences of this withdrawal were recorded in PO2, which noted that Burlington Oriente, Burlington Andean and Burlington Ecuador ceased to be parties to this arbitration as of 6 November 2009 and that, consequently, the arbitration would deal solely with Burlington's treaty claims.316\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 245:5-21 (Opening, Mayer).\n\n208.\n\nBurlington is wrong to argue, says Ecuador, that it did not waive its underlying right to be compensated. As the Tribunal determined, the Burlington Subsidiaries \"waived the possibility of ever re-filing their claims under the PSCs in any form\".317 Accordingly, the underlying rights are unenforceable and thus valueless. Ecuadorian law confirms that a withdrawal of a claim with prejudice entails a waiver of the underlying rights; Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose fails to cite a single decision to the contrary.318\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 411-412, citing: DoL, \u00b6 199.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 423, citing: *Corte Suprema de Justicia*, Quito, 20 December 1935, Gaceta Judicial, Ano XXXV, Serie V, No. 131, p. 3129 (**Exh. EL-382**).\n\n209.\n\nEcuador also opposes Burlington's alternative argument that it is entitled to postwithdrawal indemnity.319 To the extent that this argument relates to pre-expropriation tax debts, it is nonsensical. The Law 42 payments accrued *before* the withdrawal of the claims and *before* the expropriation date determined by the Tribunal. The legal foundation of these claims is still the alleged breach of the tax renegotiation clauses, and therefore these claims are not new.320\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 446-449.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 449.\n\n210.\n\nEcuador further observes that the reasons why Burlington withdrew its contract claims are irrelevant. It does not matter whether it did so as a result of the expropriation, because the past dues were in any event not part of the expropriated investment. Regardless of the reasons, \"[t]he consequences of the withdrawal are there. Burlington Oriente is not a party. Contract Claims have been withdrawn for whatever good or bad reason, and the Tribunal cannot revive what is dead\".321\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 247:3-7 (Opening, Mayer).\n\n211.\n\nEcuador appears to recognize that other tribunals have awarded the value of accrued account receivables as compensation for expropriation. However, it argues that \"[n]one of the cases on which Burlington relies for the proposition that compensation is due for expropriated contractual rights addresses the situation where those contractual rights were waived by the claimant party.322 It adds that, unlike in the present case, in those cases the debts were in any event not disputed.323\n\nCM, \u00b6 189, note 182.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 565.\n\n**1.3 Analysis**\n----------------\n\n212.\n\nAt the outset, it is necessary to recall that the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction over Burlington's umbrella clause and FET claims,324 that no contract claims are before it,325 and that it held that Law 42 and Ecuador's failure to absorb its effects did not amount to an expropriation.326 The only unlawful act identified in the Decision on Liability was the expropriation of Burlington's investment through Ecuador's permanent physical takeover of the Blocks. As a result, the Tribunal's task is circumscribed to awarding damages \"arising from and ascribable to\"327 that takeover.\n\nDoJ, \u00b6\u00b6 208, 342(D)(1); DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 220, 234, 546(B)(1).\n\nDoL, \u00b6\u00b6 220, 234, 546(B)(1).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 419, 430, 433, 456-457.\n\nCommentary 9 to Article 31 of the ILC Articles specifies that \"it is only \u2018[i]njury \u2026 caused by the internationally wrongful act of State\" for which full reparation must be made. This phrase is used to make clear that the subject matter of reparation is, globally, the injury resulting from and ascribable to the wrongful act, rather than any and all consequences flowing from an internationally wrongful act\".\n\n213.\n\nIn carrying out this task, the Tribunal must proceed to the valuation of Burlington's expropriated investment, even if the valuation involves considering contract rights which allegedly form part of the expropriated investment.328 Considering contract rights in this context, the Tribunal does not exercise jurisdiction over the PSCs; it values an expropriation claim over which there is no question that it has jurisdiction. The Tribunal thus dismisses Ecuador's jurisdictional objection.\n\nSee, for instance: *Tippetts v. Iran,* p. 227 (**Exh. CL-264**), *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (\" *SPP v. Egypt\"),* Award on the Merits of 20 May 1992 (**Exh. CL-162 and CL-376**).\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal likewise dismisses Ecuador's admissibility objection. In resolving Burlington's treaty claim, and in determining Ecuador's liability under the Treaty, the Tribunal made certain determinations regarding the content and scope of the rights arising under the PSCs' tax absorption clauses.329 The content and scope of these contract rights are thus no longer in dispute for purposes of this phase of the proceedings and the Tribunal relies on its assessment in the Decision on Liability to the extent necessary in the present context.\n\nSee, for instance: DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 334-335 (among others).\n\n215.\n\nThat being said, the Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that Burlington's claim fails on its merits. The Tribunal can only award compensation for the damages caused by the internationally wrongful act. Here, the internationally wrongful act was the permanent physical takeover of the Blocks, which the Tribunal has held to constitute an unlawful expropriation of Burlington's investment. The consequence of that physical takeover was that Burlington through its Subsidiaries lost the capacity to operate the Blocks and thus to earn revenues under the PSCs. As stated in the Decision on Liability:\n\n\"As a purely factual matter, Ecuador's entry into and occupation of Blocks 7 and 21 dispossessed Burlington of the oil fields. Such dispossession deprived Burlington not only of its oil production share \u2013 and thus of its revenues \u2013 but also of the means of production that made those revenues possible. In a nutshell, the occupation of the Blocks deprived Burlington of all the tangible property embodying its investment in Ecuador. While Burlington still had its subsidiary's rights in the PSCs as well as the subsidiary's shares, these rights and shares had no value without possession of the oil fields and access to the oil\".330\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 530.\n\n216.\n\nThis can only mean that Ecuador's physical takeover of the Blocks destroyed the value of Burlington's rights under the PSCs going forward, i.e., its possibility of producing oil and obtaining revenues from oil sales in the future. The Decision on Liability makes this clear when it states that *\"[a]s of this date [30 August 2009]*, Ecuador deprived Burlington of the effective use and control of Blocks 7 and 21 on a permanent basis, and thus expropriated its investment\".331\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 535 (emphasis added).\n\n217.\n\nBy contrast, the physical takeover of the Blocks could not *per se* destroy the value of Burlington's credits for the reimbursement of Law 42 dues that had accrued *before* the date of expropriation. The Burlington Subsidiaries retained their right to demand payment of these accrued credits. Had Ecuador expropriated the Burlington Subsidiaries' shares, the situation may have been different. And while the Tribunal held that, as a result of the expropriation, the Burlington Subsidiaries' rights in the PSCs \"had no value without possession of the oil fields and access to the oil\",332 this statement only applies as of 30 August 2009.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 530.\n\n218.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal stated that Burlington's right to tax absorption under the PSCs was \"part and parcel\" of the value of its investment333 and constituted \"the most valuable portion\"334 of that investment does not assist Burlington's case. The expropriation caused Burlington to lose this right from 30 August 2009 onwards; it would not have prevented the Burlington Subsidiaries from exercising it with respect to debts accrued before this date, if they had not waived their right to claim.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 405.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 260.\n\n219.\n\nAt the Hearing, Burlington raised a new argument, according to which its right to past Law 42 dues is \"not a simple accrued debt\", but a right to the application of a \"contractual adjustment that requires a contractual mechanism\" that was taken together with the PSCs.335 Since it has lost the PSCs, so Burlington argues, it can no longer request Ecuador to apply that contractual mechanism. The Tribunal cannot agree. As Ecuador points out,336 the Burlington Subsidiaries' right to specific performance of that contractual mechanism became a right to claim compensation for Ecuador's failure to perform, which survived the contract (otherwise no contract claimant could ever claim damages on the basis of a terminated contract).\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1392:17-1396:16 (Closing, Coriell).\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1507:10-1508:10 (Closing, Mayer).\n\n220.\n\nBurlington's additional arguments similarly fail. Although the Tribunal did state that \"by enacting Law 42 and then refusing to absorb its effect pursuant to the tax absorption clauses, Ecuador has in effect nullified Burlington's right to a correction factor by preventing the exercise of this right\", and that \"this nullification was made possible through the use of Ecuador's sovereign powers\",337 it ultimately held that Ecuador's failure to absorb the effects of Law 42, be it at 50% or at 99%, did not substantially deprive Burlington of its investment.338 It thus rejected Burlington's indirect expropriation claim based on Law 42 and Ecuador's contractual breaches.339\n\nDoL, \u00b6 418.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 419 (finding that Ecuador's breach of the tax absorption clauses of the PSCs was a \"relevant, although by no means decisive, consideration for purposes of the expropriation analysis, which entails a broader inquiry into the investment's overall capacity to generate commercial returns for the benefit of the investor\", and noting that \"[t]he Tribunal must next determine whether Law 42, first at 50% and then at 99%, amounted to an expropriation of Burlington's investment\"); \u00b6 430 (holding that \"the effects of Law 42 at 50 % do not amount to a substantial deprivation of the value of Burlington's investment\"); and \u00b6 456 (holding that \"the Tribunal is not persuaded that Law 42 at 99% substantially deprived Burlington of the value of its investment\").\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 456 (holding that \"there can be no expropriation in the absence of substantial deprivation\"); \u00b6 433 (finding that \"Law 42 at 50% did not substantially deprive Burlington of the value of its investment, and was therefore not a measure tantamount to expropriation\"); and \u00b6 457 (finding that \"the effects of Law 42 at 99% were not tantamount to expropriation and, accordingly, that Law 42 at 99% did not expropriate Burlington's investment\").\n\n221.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal expressly rejected Burlington's claim that Ecuador's measures taken together constituted a creeping expropriation.340 Indeed, the Tribunal found that \"Burlington was not operating under conditions of substantial deprivation before Ecuador physically occupied the Blocks\", \"[n]or is it possible to conclude that before that point Burlington had lost its ability to \u2018make rational decisions'\".341\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 538-540.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 540.\n\n222.\n\nFinally, in the circumstances described here, if the Tribunal were to grant compensation for past Law 42 dues, it would give relief for Ecuador's failure to comply with the PSC tax absorption clauses, when it has held that such noncompliance was not an expropriation and it had no jurisdiction over other treaty breaches and contract violations. In other words, it would grant relief for an act for which it has ruled out liability or over which it lacks jurisdiction.\n\n223.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Burlington's claim for its accrued rights against Ecuador for the reimbursement of past Law 42 payments or *coactiva* seizures is not a compensable loss under Burlington's treaty claim.\n\n224.\n\nThat does not mean that Burlington (or rather, the Burlington Subsidiaries) may not have a contract claim against Ecuador. However, as a result of the withdrawal of the claims of the Burlington Subsidiaries, these companies are no longer parties to this arbitration and the Tribunal cannot rule on their claims. This arbitration deals solely with Burlington's treaty claims against Ecuador.342\n\nPO2, \u00b6 III.1.\n\n**2. Value of the operating assets (lost profits under the PSCs)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**2.1 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n225.\n\nBurlington asserts that Ecuador must compensate it for profits lost \"from the production foregone\", which Burlington would have obtained under the PSCs absent the expropriation, as valued on the date of the award. Burlington's financial expert, Compass Lexecon, calls this head of damages \"value of operating assets\", the assets in question being the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n226.\n\nBurlington submits that \"[i]nternational law requires that the State pay an amount of damages representing the fair market value of the affected investment\", adding that \"[w]here (as here) the investment was a \u2018going concern' prior to the unlawful expropriation, an assessment of fair market value must take future profitability into consideration in order to provide full compensation\".343\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55.\n\n227.\n\nBecause Burlington values this head of damages on the date of the award, its lost production can be broken down into two elements: (i) profits already lost, i.e., losses to the date of the award, with interest applied to actualize the cash flows to present value, and (ii) future lost profits, i.e., losses from the date of the award until the expiry of the PSCs, discounted to present value.344\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 74. See: paragraph 287 below.\n\n228.\n\nUsing the discounted cash flow (DCF) method and Compass Lexecon's assumptions, in the Updated Model these lost profits are quantified at **USD 840.9 million** as of 31 August 2016 (the date used as a proxy for the date of the award), including pre-award interest. Relying on the full reparation principle, Compass Lexecon has ignored the economic effects of Law 42 when making this quantification.\n\n**2.2 Ecuador's position**\n--------------------------\n\n229.\n\nEcuador acknowledges that \"in accordance with international law, compensation should correspond to the fair market value (\"FMV\") of Burlington's purportedly expropriated investment\" and that, \"[i]n the context of going concerns, the tribunal will look to the investment's \"earning capacity during the remainder of its life for assessing its \u2018market value'\".345\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 327, citing: *Middle East Cement v. Egypt,* \u00b6 127 (**Exh. CL-271**).\n\n230.\n\nMore specifically, Ecuador accepts that the expropriated assets in this case consist of Burlington's rights to operate Blocks 7 and 21 under the PSCs, and that Burlington is entitled to the FMV of these rights as reflected in the profits that Burlington would have earned under those contracts.346 Ecuador does not contest that the value of Burlington's expropriated investment should be quantified by reference to the contract rights indirectly held by Burlington through its Subsidiaries. As discussed in more detail below, Ecuador also agrees that a DCF analysis is the appropriate valuation method.347\n\nSee, for instance: CM \u00b6\u00b6 8, 324-327; Rejoinder, \u00b6 454. Ecuador clarifies that it does not agree that the FMV is \"simply a proxy for the lost future cash flows\", since under certain circumstances, \"lost future cash flows operate as a proxy for FMV\", and Dr. Abdala now admitted to have calculated the value of future cash flows, not the FMV of Burlington's investment. Rejoinder, \u00b6 455.\n\nSee: Section VII.D.2.2 below.\n\n231.\n\nBy contrast, Ecuador submits that Burlington's valuation of these lost profits is grossly inflated, mainly because Burlington misapplies the relevant standards of compensation, uses the wrong valuation date, bases its calculation on incorrect assumptions (in particular, it fails to account for Law 42 taxes when projecting future profits), and applies an exaggerated interest rate. According to Ecuador's expert, Fair Links, the FMV of the PSCs, valued on the date of the expropriation, is USD 26.3 million. Because Ecuador values the investment on the date of the expropriation, the Tribunal notes that its valuation is composed solely of projected future profits discounted back to the date of the expropriation.\n\n**2.3 Analysis**\n----------------\n\n232.\n\nThere is common ground that the value of Burlington's investment should be quantified by reference to the profit-making capacity of the PSCs (which Burlington indirectly held through its Subsidiaries)348 as of the date of expropriation and for the remainder of their term. As stated in the Decision on Liability,349 Ecuador's physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 deprived Burlington of the possibility to earn future revenues under the PSCs. The Tribunal further held that Ecuador's physical takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 became permanent on 30 August 2009.350 As a result, \"[a]s of this date, Ecuador deprived Burlington of the effective use and control of Blocks 7 and 21 on a permanent basis, and thus expropriated its investment\".351 In other words, the physical takeover of the Blocks deprived Burlington of the possibility of obtaining future revenues from the PSCs from 30 August 2009 onwards. On this basis, the Tribunal considers that Burlington's lost profits claim from 30 August 2009 onwards is a compensable loss.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty provides that \"investment\" means \"every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled ***directly or indirectly*** by nationals or companies of the other Party\", and includes \"any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law\" (Emphasis added).\n\nDoL, \u00b6 530.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 535.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n233.\n\nIt is undisputed that Burlington seeks to recover the value of its own investment, represented by its share in the Consortium's revenues, and not the entire value of the Consortium's investment. Compass Lexecon makes this clear when it states that it \"[i]n order to compute the damages incurred by Burlington, I apply its equity participation in each of the Blocks: 42.5% in Block 7 and 46.25% in Block 21 (since October 2006)\".352 Ecuador acknowledges this.353 As a result, no risk of double recovery by Burlington and Perenco (who has initiated its own claim) would arise from an award from this Tribunal on this head of claim.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 9.\n\nEcuador notes in particular that \"[i]t It is not in dispute that Burlington's free cash flows, assuming no Law 42, result from deducting from the Consortium's gross revenues (i) the State's participation (i.e., share of production), (ii) the operating costs (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX), (iii) Perenco's share of the Blocks' revenues (53.75% of Block 21 and 57.5% of Block 7), and (iv) Burlington's income tax and labor participation\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 345).\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal will address Ecuador's objections to the valuation of this claim in Section C below.\n\n**3. Lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**3.1 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n235.\n\nBurlington argues that Ecuador's \"unlawful conduct\" deprived Burlington of the opportunity to negotiate in good faith an extension of the Block 7 PSC, and Ecuador must compensate for that loss of opportunity.354 According to the *Chorz\u00f4w* standard of full reparation, damages include all the profits that Burlington would have obtained absent the unlawful activity, which destroyed the opportunity to negotiate a contract extension.355 Burlington submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this claim (Section 3.1.1), that in the \"but for\" world, Burlington would have enjoyed a right to negotiate the extension of the Block 7 PSC (Section 3.1.2), and that Burlington would \"in all probability\" have obtained an eight-year extension under revised contractual terms (Section 3.1.3).\n\nMem., \u00b6 112.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 114.\n\n**3.1.1 The Tribunal has jurisdiction over this claim**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nContrary to Ecuador's contention, Burlington submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to compensate the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC.356 In the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that the investment must be assessed \"as a whole\" and the value of the lost opportunity to negotiate the extension is part of the value of the PSC that was taken. The claim for the value of the Block 7 extension is thus a treaty, not a contract claim. Burlington's submission is not that Ecuador \"breached an agreement for a contract extension\", but that Burlington was deprived \"of the valuable opportunity *to seek an extension* \".357 In other words, Burlington does not claim the breach of a contractually agreed extension, but for the economic value of the right to negotiate such an extension, which, it argues, *would probably have been agreed* but for Ecuador's unlawful conduct. Ecuador's argument that Burlington may not raise this claim because it was not a party to the PSC and because its Subsidiaries have withdrawn their contract claims fails for the same reasons.358\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 200-208.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 206 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 207.\n\n237.\n\nAccording to Burlington, the argument that it brings a new treaty claim for lost opportunity without having given Ecuador notice under Article VI of the BIT is equally ill-founded. The term \"investment\" is defined broadly under the BIT. It includes \"any right conferred by law or contract\", which encompasses Clause 6.2 of the PSC providing the right to an extension.359 Therefore, Burlington's existing treaty claim covers Burlington's lost opportunity to negotiate an extension of the Block 7 PSC.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 208.\n\n238.\n\nBurlington also submits that, in the \"but for\" world, it would have enjoyed a right to negotiate the extension of the Block 7 PSC (Section 3.1.2),360 and would \"in all probability\" have obtained an eight-year extension under revised contractual terms (Section 3.1.3).361 Burlington further argues that tribunals have recognized the importance of lost opportunities in the valuation of an investment (Section 3.1.4).362\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 116-124.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 131-133.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 125-130.\n\n239.\n\nIn support of its claim, Burlington relies on Mr. Moyes' expert report, which explains the terms on which Burlington would \"in all probability\" have obtained a contract extension in a context of good faith negotiations as mandated under the PSCs and Ecuadorian law.363\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 115, 187; Reply, \u00b6 200, referring to: Moyes ER2, \u00b6 12.\n\n**3.1.2 In the \"but for\" world, Burlington would have enjoyed a right to negotiate the extension of the Block 7 PSC**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nAccording to Burlington, Article 6.2 of the Block 7 PSC sets out the conditions for a \"mandatory negotiation concerning an extension\". Under that provision, the contract term may be extended in four situations: (a) if and when it is in the State's best interests, (b) if the production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon infrastructures, (c) if the contractor proposes significant new investments during the last five years of the contract, or (d) if new deposits are discovered as an exclusive result of new exploration.\n\n241.\n\nIn addition, Article 1562 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code establishes the general duty to perform all contracts in good faith.364 Hence, once the Consortium satisfied any of the conditions set forth in Article 6.2, Ecuador was under a duty to negotiate an extension in good faith.365\n\nMem., \u00b6 123, citing: Codigo Civil, Article 1562 (**Exh. CL-59**) ; Estatuto del R\u00e9gimen Jur\u00efdico Administratif de la Funcion Ejecutiva, Article 101(1) (**Exh. CL-266**).\n\nMem., \u00b6 124.\n\n242.\n\nBurlington alleges that the Consortium would have met at least three of the four alternative conditions.366 First, as Mr. Moyes explains, it would undoubtedly have been in Ecuador's best interests to extend the Block 7 PSC.367 Ecuador is wrong to argue that it has the discretionary power under Clause 6.2 to grant an extension or not. Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose clarified that Ecuador's public administration was under a duty to protect Burlington's \"legitimate expectation\" and Ecuadorian law recognizes compensation for lost opportunities.368 Fair Links' suggestion that Petroamazonas had the capacity to operate the Blocks directly misses the point, says Burlington. The fact that Ecuador entered into contracts with seven private consortia between 2010 and 2012 demonstrates that Ecuador itself considered that its interests were best served by having its oilfields operated by third parties.369\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 117; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 209-226.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 118, 124, 133, referring to: Moyes ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 44-46, 58-60.\n\nReply, \u00b6 212, referring to: P\u00e9rez Loose ER, \u00b6\u00b6 181-183, 192.\n\nReply, \u00b6 213, referring to: Moyes ER2, \u00b6 12.\n\n243.\n\nSecond, Burlington and its Consortium partner unquestionably proposed and made significant investments during the last five years of production (at least until October 2007 when Decree 662 was imposed). Burlington invested **USD 213 million** between 2005 and 2007 \"yielding substantial increases in production\".370\n\nMem., \u00b6 119, referring to: Burlington Oriente Financial Statements FY 2002-2003, 20032004, 2004-2005 (**Exhs.

The estimated reserves grew from an initial 33.5 million barrels in 2004 to 70 million barrels in 2006, namely an increase of over 100%.384\n\nMem., \u00b6 121; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 210-211.\n\nMem., \u00b6 121, referring to: Crick WS1, \u00b6 150.\n\nMem., \u00b6 121, referring to: Crick WS1, \u00b6 152.\n\n249.\n\nBurlington adds that, contrary to Ecuador's assertions, the Consortium did carry out the required exploratory activities in Oso.385 The 2006 Oso Development Plan \"resulted exclusively from the Consortium's new exploration activities\" leading to the discovery and development of the north Oso field, which was sufficient to \"trigger\" the extension under Article 6.2, as Mr. Moyes confirms.386\n\nReply, \u00b6 210.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 211, referring to: Moyes ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 47.\n\n**3.1.3 Burlington would \"in all probability\" have obtained an eight-year extension under revised contractual terms**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nBurlington is of the view that it would \"in all probability\" have obtained an eight-year extension of the Block 7 PSC, although it acknowledges that it would have had to accept revised contract terms.387 According to Mr. Moyes, assuming good faith on both sides, contractual negotiations for an extension would most likely have resulted in a revised contract with the following characteristics: (a) a service contract with a fixed fee per barrel, (b) and a service fee of USD 35 per barrel, adjusted for inflation, for existing wells, and a fee yielding 25% return on investment for new or incremental production, (c) for a duration of eight years.388\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 131-133.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 187, referring to: Moyes ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.\n\n251.\n\nIt is Burlington's submission that, had Ecuador complied with its contractual obligation to absorb the tax and acted as a reasonable contract partner, the Consortium would have accepted such revised terms, as Mr. Martinez confirmed.389 In Mr. Moyes' expert opinion, these terms would also have been acceptable to Ecuador, since they compare to those achieved in Blocks 10 (Agip) and 16 (Repsol).390 They would also have been in line with President Correa's new \"single model\" contract form.391\n\nMem., \u00b6 132, referring to: Martinez WS4 Supp., \u00b6 12.\n\nMem., \u00b6 133, referring to: Moyes ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 51-57.\n\nMem., \u00b6 133, referring to: *Correa Proposes \u2018Single Model' for Contracts with Foreign Oil Companies,* El Diario, 14 April 2008 (**Exh.

Egypt*, and *CME v. Czech Republic*. For Burlington, these cases show that \"an investment's future prospects, whether dependent on a contract or license, are central to its value\".393 In *Sapphire Petroleum*, the arbitrator awarded compensation for lost opportunity to generate profit from the concession although operations were in an early stage and no oil had yet been discovered.394 The arbitrator found it clear that the plaintiff had lost an opportunity to discover oil, which he regarded to be \"very favourable\".395 He further held that, where damage cannot be proven, it is enough \"to be able to admit with sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage\".396 In *SPP*, the tribunal considered the lost opportunity of making a commercial success of the project.397 In *CME*, the tribunal applied the \"but for\" scenario assuming that the broadcast license would have been renewed \"in all likelihood\", and considered the \"reasonable probability of license renewal\" when valuing the investment.398 In the present circumstances, the situation is much simpler, says Burlington, since Block 7 was already \"highly productive\" at the time of expropriation \"and remains so to this day\".399 By contrast, *Gemplus*, upon which Ecuador relies, must be distinguished from the present case given that Burlington produced \"extensive evidence\" proving the \"strong likelihood\" of receiving a contract extension.400\n\nMem., \u00b6 125.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 130.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 126, citing: *Sapphire International Petroleums Ltd. v.

This latter test is \"more than satisfied\", since, absent Law 42, an extension was \"reasonably certain\".\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 225-226.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 225, referring to: *SPP v.

First, Ecuador argues that this is a contract claim over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction (Section 3.2.1). Alternatively, Ecuador submits that the claim is inadmissible or fails on the merits (Section 3.2.2).\n\n**3.2.1 Burlington's lost opportunity claim is a contract claim over which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nIt is Ecuador's primary submission that Burlington's lost opportunity claim is contractual in nature, as a result of which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.404 Ecuador's arguments regarding contract claims set out in Section VII.C.1.2 above apply *mutatis mutandis* to the present claim.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 324.\n\n257.\n\nMore specifically, Ecuador argues that Burlington's self-serving argument that the negotiation of a contract extension is part of the value of its investment is \"insufficient\" to support the existence of a treaty claim. By resorting to the broad definition of the term investment, Burlington attempts to introduce a contract claim through the back door. If the Tribunal applies an objective test, it will recognize that the claim is based on the PSCs. This is clear if one considers that the claim is based on the alleged breach of the tax renegotiation clauses.405\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 343.\n\n**3.2.2 In the alternative, Burlington's claim is inadmissible or fails on the merits**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nAlternatively, if the Tribunal were to hold that Burlington's claim is based on a treaty obligation, this claim would be inadmissible, because \"(i) Burlington's claims pertain to the vindication of contract rights and (ii) there is a genuine dispute as to the existence and scope of said rights\".406 Ecuador's specific arguments in this respect are set out in Section VII.C.1.2 above.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 370. Ecuador advances this argument for all claims related to Law 42, as well as for the claim for lost opportunity to extend Block 7.\n\n259.\n\nIf the Tribunal does not reject the claim for lack of jurisdiction or inadmissibility, Ecuador submits that it must dismiss it on the merits. According to Ecuador, this claim is nothing more than an attempt by Burlington to create damages \"where none exist\".407 Mr. Moyes is not an expert on the Ecuadorian oil sector, as a consequence of which his opinion is irrelevant. This is especially true of his speculations with respect to the buy-out of Murphy Oil's interest in Block 16 and his misrepresentations regarding the context of the negotiations of the contracts to which he refers.408 Nor is Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's opinion of any support for Burlington's imaginary claim, which artificially inflates its damages claim by \"a staggering USD 300.5 million (of which USD 135.6 million is interest)\".409\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 751.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 752-753, referring to: Moyes ER2, \u00b6 42.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 754-755.\n\n260.\n\nFor Ecuador, this claim must be dismissed for three reasons: (i) Ecuador had full discretion to grant an extension or not, (ii) Burlington is solely responsible for having foregone the opportunity to continue operations, and (iii) no willing buyer would have attributed any value to the remote and uncertain alleged opportunity.\n\n261.\n\nFirst, Ecuador asserts that it holds discretionary power under Article 6.2 of the Block 7 PSC to decide \"if and when\" it is in its best interests to grant an extension.410 Burlington had no vested right, not even a legitimate expectation to a contract extension.411 To wit, Article 6.2 provides that the contract term *\"podra ser prorrogable, siempre y cuando convenga a los intereses del Estado* \".412 This language unequivocally shows the State's discretionary power. It does not create an \"entitlement\" to an extension, as Burlington argues.413 Prof. Aguilar, Ecuador's legal expert, opined that the use of the words \" *podra ser* \" indicates that Ecuador was under no obligation to grant an extension, and that it had the authority to determine if and when a contract extension was in the State's best interest.414 Even if there is an obligation to negotiate (in French, an *obligation de moyens*), there is no obligation to achieve a specific result (in French, an *obligation de r\u00e9sultat*).415\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 757, 780.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 767-768, 780.\n\nDr. P\u00e9rez Loose translates this as \"this term may be extended, if and when it is in the best interests of the State [\u2026]\". (P\u00e9rez Loose ER (English translation), \u00b6 159). Ecuador provides a virtually identical translation of this language (\"this term may be extended, if and when it is in the State's best interest [\u2026]\". CM, \u00b6 230, note 213).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 759, referring to: Aguilar ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 57-63.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 763, referring to: Aguilar ER4, \u00b6\u00b6 77-81; ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 765.\n\n262.\n\nIn any event, Ecuador asserts that Burlington failed to meet the technical requirements under Article 6.2 to qualify for a potential extension. But even if it had, it would still be irrelevant in light of the discretionary power of the State. Beyond economic considerations, Ecuador would have considered the following aspects before accepting an extension: the imposition of the single service contract model, Burlington's sabotage of the negotiations with Perenco, the fact that Burlington had stopped investing in Ecuador since December 2007, and Burlington's intention to sell its Ecuadorian assets.416 These facts would have led Ecuador to conclude that an extension was not in its best interest.417\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 761.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 762.\n\n263.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Ecuador notes that Burlington has abandoned its prior argument that it qualified for an extension based on significant investments. Instead, it now limits itself to arguing that it allegedly discovered new oil deposits.418 However, notes Ecuador, Burlington failed to rebut its argument that every new oil discovery gives rise to the application of a specific economic regime under Article 8.1.1 of the Block 7 PSC for purposes of allocation of produced oil. Yet, the alleged Oso field discoveries \"remained subject to the same economic regime\" as the rest of Block 7, indicating that Burlington itself did not truly believe to have made a new discovery.419\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 773-774, referring to: Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 210-211.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 775-778.\n\n264.\n\nAs a second substantive reason for the Tribunal to refuse to award damages concerning the potential extension of the Block 7 PSC, Ecuador submits that Burlington's claim fails for lack of causation, since Burlington's alleged loss was not and could not have been caused by Ecuador. It was Burlington's strategic decision to leave Ecuador and to torpedo the negotiation process that led to its alleged losses. Indeed, Burlington admitted that it preferred to proceed with its \"asset divestment strategy\".420 Ecuador engaged in negotiations with Perenco, which remained open, but Burlington prevented Perenco from agreeing to \"fairer contractual terms\".421 In fact, Burlington was never interested in reaching an agreement and even threatened legal action against Perenco. Accordingly, for Ecuador, Burlington is solely responsible for having foregone the opportunity to negotiate an extension of its operations.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 782, referring to: Letter from Burlington Resources to PetroEcuador, 7 October 2008 (**Exh. E-140**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 783.\n\n265.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, this failure to prove causation is fatal to Burlington's claim, as only damages caused by an internationally wrongful act are subject to compensation in international law. Burlington's \"abusive mention of purported unlawful action **s**, in the plural\" must not be entertained, in light of the Tribunal's finding that the only internationally wrongful act in this case was Ecuador's failure to pay compensation.422\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 792 (emphasis in original).\n\n266.\n\nEcuador's third argument is that no willing buyer would have attributed a value to the alleged lost opportunity in light of its uncertainty and remoteness.423 Burlington's own test of \"reasonable certainty\" and \"sufficient probability\" leads to the conclusion that its claim must fail. Burlington cannot even show that it sought the negotiation of an extension, and the ConocoPhillips sale documents show that the intent was to sell the group's interests in Ecuador in any event. Moreover, the true reason for Burlington's decision to stop investing in the Blocks was the poor quality of the reservoirs and the \"imminent expiry\" of the Block 7 PSC, not Law 42.424 For Ecuador, it cannot have been Law 42, since contemporaneous documentation shows that the Oso field was still profitable in October 2007 and the Consortium considered drilling new wells even under Law 42 at 99%.425\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 794-821.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 799-800.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 801, referring to: Internal ConocoPhillips email titled \u2018 *Drilling Plan Proposal from Perenco',* 9 October 2007 (**Exh.

All the examples cited by Mr. Moyes relate to renegotiated and amended contracts which were to migrate to the service contract model. Furthermore, the service contracts agreed with Eni/Agip and Repsol cannot be used as reference here as the contracts are not comparable. Repsol reached an agreement during the transitory period in 2008, when Burlington insisted on blocking a similar agreement.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 802, referring to: Reply, \u00b6 302; *CME v. Czech Republic,* \u00b6 605 (**Exh. CL-174**).\n\n268.\n\nFinally, Mr. Moyes' analysis of the \"likely terms\" of a renegotiated contract is based on his personal considerations, and he failed to show that Ecuador's position on the relevance of such \"likely terms\" is wrong.427\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 280-290; Rejoinder, \u00b6 808.\n\n**3.3 Analysis**\n----------------\n\n269.\n\nThrough its lost opportunity claim, Burlington is in effect asking the Tribunal to find that its profit stream under the Block 7 PSC would have continued for an additional eight years after the expiry of the then-existing contract term, albeit on different terms.428 It can thus be understood as expanding the production profile under which Burlington values the Block 7 PSC, with some modifications. In this context, although this claim (like all the other claims of Burlington) is linked to the PSCs, the Tribunal considers that it is in essence a claim for damages caused by the expropriation, that is, a treaty claim over which the Tribunal indeed has jurisdiction.\n\nRelying on Mr. Moyes' testimony, Compass Lexecon projects the Block 7 PSC's profit stream from 16 August 2010 to 16 August 2018 based on a service contract where the Consortium receives (i) \"[a] service fee of US$ 35 per gross barrel produced from all wells that Claimant would have drilled absent the extension, partially adjusted for inflation\"; and (ii) \"[a] service fee for incremental investments (i.e., new wells and associated facilities that are only to be drilled under the extension scenario) which would allow the Consortium to achieve a 25% return on such incremental investments\". Compass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 56.\n\n270.\n\nEcuador nonetheless invokes the inadmissibility of this claim. The Tribunal has already examined this objection with respect to Burlington's claim for past Law 42 dues (see paragraph 214 above), to which discussion it refers. As a result, it holds that this claim is admissible.\n\n271.\n\nIn the further alternative, Ecuador is of the view that this claim fails on its merits. The Tribunal agrees. Under the clear and unambiguous terms of Article 6.2 of the Block 7 PSC, Burlington did not have an entitlement to a contract extension that could have been taken or destroyed as a result of Ecuador's expropriation. All that it had, and all that it lost, was a right to negotiate such an extension. Its claim for profits allegedly lost as a result of this loss of its right to negotiate a contract extension fails for the reasons explained below.\n\n272.\n\nIt is evident from the wording of Article 6.2 that Ecuador had full discretion to allow an extension of the Block 7 PSC or not, even under a new service contract model. Article 6.2 reads as follows:\n\n\"El Per\u00edodo de Explotaci\u00f3n durar\u00e1 en el presente caso, hasta el diecis\u00e9is de agosto de dos mil diez; este plazo podr\u00e1 ser prorrogable, siempre y cuando convenga a los intereses del Estado por las siguientes causas: Cuando el \u00e1rea de explotaci\u00f3n se encuentre alejada de la infraestructura hidrocarbur\u00edfera petrolera existente, previa aprobaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo y por un per\u00edodo de hasta cinco (5) a\u00f1os. Cuando la Contratista proponga nuevas inversiones significativas en los \u00faltimos cinco (5) a\u00f1os del Per\u00edodo de Explotaci\u00f3n, previa aceptaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo y aprobaci\u00f3n del CEL, siempre y cuando requieran plazos adecuados de amortizaci\u00f3n para dichas inversiones. Para el caso de eventuales descubrimientos de nuevos Yacimientos de Hidrocarburos Comercialmente Explotables provenientes exclusivamente de trabajos de nueva exploraci\u00f3n que realizare la Contratista, el plazo de Per\u00edodo de Explotaci\u00f3n se prorrogar\u00e1 previa aceptaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo y aprobaci\u00f3n del CEL\".429\n\n**Exh. C-1**. Burlington provides the following [unofficial] translation (Mem., \u00b6 116): \"In this case, the Production Period will last until August sixteenth (16), two thousand ten (2010); this term may be extended, if and when it is in the State's best interest, **or** for the following reasons:  \n \u2022 When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon production infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and for a period of up to five (5) years;  \n\u2022 When the Contractor proposes significant new investments during the last five (5) years of the Production Period, with the agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the [Special Bid Committee], if and when adequate amortization periods are required for those investments;  \n \u2022 If new Commercial Hydrocarbon Deposits are discovered as an exclusive result of new exploration work performed by the Contractor, the Production Period will be extended with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the [Special Bid Committee]\" (emphasis added by the Tribunal).  \n In turn, Ecuador provides the following unofficial translation (CM, \u00b6 230, note 213): \"In this case, the Production Period will last until August sixteenth (16), two thousand ten (2010); this term may be extended, if and when it is in the State's best interest for the following reasons: When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon production infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and for a period of up to five (5) years; When the Contractor proposes significant new investments during the last five (5) years of the Production Period, with the agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the CEL, if and when adequate amortization periods are required for those investments; If new Commercial Hydrocarbon Deposits are discovered as an exclusive result of new exploration work performed by the Contractor, the Production Period will be extended with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the CEL\").  \n The Tribunal prefers Ecuador's translation, which does not contain the emphasized \"or\" in first sentence, and which does not exist in the Spanish original.\n\n273.\n\nAs Prof. Aguilar opines, this clause contains three rules that must be analyzed separately: (i) first, the contractual term may be extended; (ii) second, the extension will only be granted if it is in the State's interests, and, additionally, (iii) at least one of three requirements must be met.430\n\nAguilar ER3, \u00b6 59.\n\n274.\n\nWith respect to (i), it appears from the use of the verb \" *podr\u00e1*\u00a0\" (\"may\") that this provision grants the State discretion to grant the extension or not. If the extension had been mandatory, the provision would have used the verb \" *deber\u00e1*\u00a0\" (\"shall\") or the future imperative tense \" *se prorrogar\u00e1*\u00a0\" (\"shall or will be extended\"). The Tribunal further notes that the provision states that the contract \" *podr\u00e1 ser prorroga**ble* \", which strictly speaking should be translated as \"may be subject to an extension\", or \"may be extendable\", instead of \" *podr\u00e1 ser prorroga**do* \", meaning \"may be extended\". The use of two terms that indicate possibility rather than certainty (\" *podr\u00e1*\u00a0\" and \" *prorrogable* \") confirms the opinion of the Tribunal that this was a discretionary power.431 This does not mean that the State had unfettered discretion. The State's discretion must be exercised reasonably and the PSCs imposed further limits, as described below.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.\n\n275.\n\nSecond, the extension may be granted \" *siempre y cuando* \" (if and when) it is in the State's interests. The determination of what are the State's best interests can only rest with the State itself, which strengthens the discretionary nature of this extension. As Prof. Aguilar explains, the interests of the State are not merely economic; they are also social and political.432 Even if Burlington could prove that the Block 7 extension would have been economically rational for Ecuador (a question of fact that the Tribunal need not address), it cannot be presumed that the extension would necessarily have been in the State's interests.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 73 (\"[W]hen we are dealing with the public interest, which is the one assessed the moment a discretional power is exercised, judgments do not respond solely and necessarily to economic rationality, which is doubtless very important in Private Law. Public interest consults not only this rationality, but also social rationality and political rationality, which the administrative authority is required to consider to satisfy collective interests and the common good\") (translation by the Tribunal).\n\n276.\n\nFinally, under Article 6.2 of the Block 7 PSC, the extension may only be granted in one or more of the following three scenarios:\n\ni. \"When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon production infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and for a period of up to five (5) years\";\n\nii. \"When the Contractor proposes significant new investments during the last five (5) years of the Production Period, with the agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the CEL, if and when adequate amortization periods are required for those investments\";\n\niii. \"If new Commercial Hydrocarbon Deposits are discovered as an exclusive result of new exploration work performed by the Contractor, the Production Period will be extended with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the CEL\".433\n\nArticle 6.2 of the Block 7 PSC (**Exh. C-1**) (unofficial translation provided by Ecuador at CM, \u00b6 230, note 213).\n\n277.\n\nIn each of these three scenarios, the consent of the State is required. None gives rise to an \"automatic\" extension. In addition to the discretion of the State just referred to, the extension is subject to the \"prior approval of the Ministry\" and in the last two scenarios also to the \"approval of the CEL\". It is true that the third scenario uses more imperative language *(\"se prorrogar\u00e1\",* or \"shall be extended\"), but that is only if the prior approval of the State is obtained. While Mr. Moyes might possibly be right that in the ordinary course of business an extension would likely have been agreed on service contract terms acceptable to Ecuador and Burlington (that Burlington refused it in the actual circumstances is not determinative), it nonetheless remains that any extension was subject to the consent of the State.\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that, even if Burlington had met any of the three conditions listed above (a factual inquiry in which, for reasons of procedural efficiency, the Tribunal does not engage), Burlington would not have been entitled to an extension of the Block 7 PSC. In other words, as noted above, Burlington did not have a right to a contractual extension that could have been either taken or destroyed as a result of Ecuador's expropriation. At most, Burlington had a right to negotiate a contract extension \u2013 in its words, a right to a \"mandatory negotiation concerning an extension\" (see paragraph 240 above). In the Tribunal's view, Burlington has not proven, with the reasonable certainty that international law requires for a lost profits claim, that an extension capable of being \"taken\" would in fact have materialized from its right to negotiate.434 As noted in *Merrill Ring*, \"the state cannot guarantee a profit which is no more than an expectation on the drawing board and which may or may not be realized\".435 Thus, as in *Gemplus*,436 when valuing Burlington's lost profits under the Block 7 PSC, the Tribunal will project lost profits until the expiry of the term Block 7 PSC on 31 August 2010 and not beyond.\n\nArticle 36 of the ILC Articles provides that \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established\". Tribunals have consistently found that lost profits may only be awarded if there is sufficient or reasonable certainty that they would have materialized. See, for instance: *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No ARB/87/3) (\" *AAPL v. Sri Lanka* \"), Award of 27 June 1990, \u00b6 104 (**Exh. CL-113**), *Micula v. Romania,* Award of 11 December 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 10061010 (**Exh. EL-248**). See also: M. M. Whiteman, *Damages in International Law,* vol. II (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1937), p. 1837 (noting that the assessment of prospective profits requires proof that \"they were reasonably anticipated; and that the profits anticipated were probable and not merely possible\"), and J. Y Gotanda, \"Recovering Lost Profits in International Disputes\", 36 *Georgetown Journal of International Law* 61 (2004), p. 111.\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) (\" *Merrill & Ring v. Canada* \"), Award of 31 March 2010, \u00b6 149 (**Exh. CL-155**).\n\nSee: *Gemplus v. Mexico,* Award of 16 June 2010, \u00b6 12.49 (**Exh. EL-243**) (\"The period of the Concession Agreement was ten years, commencing on 15 September 1999 and expiring on 14 September 2009 [\u2026]. There was a possible extension thereafter of not more than ten more years, subject (inter alia) to the discretion of the Secretariat. Whilst the exercise of that discretion was not unfettered under Mexican law, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants' claim for this second period of ten years is far too contingent, uncertain and unproven, lacking any sufficient factual basis for the assessment of compensation under the two BITs. At the relevant date, the Concessionaire had no legal right to any extension of the Concession's original ten-year term; and as the Concessionaire's minority shareholders, the Claimants' rights as investors under the BITs were still more nebulous and speculative. Accordingly, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the Concession Agreement would not have continued beyond 14 September 2009, i.e. 8.25 years after the Requisition of 25 June 2001; and the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' claims based upon any period thereafter\").\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that, even if Burlington did not have a *right* to a contract extension, it may have had an *opportunity* to extend the contract that could potentially have value. Tribunals have recognized that the loss of a business opportunity (or \"loss of a chance\") may give rise to compensation.437 That is not equivalent to the lost profits that the opportunity, had it materialized, would have been generated. Indeed, there is a possibility that the chance may not have materialized. That element of uncertainty must be built into the claim.438 As counsel for Burlington put it in a legal publication:\n\n\"A loss of opportunity (or chance) is a sub-category of lost profits where not only the magnitude but even the existence of monetary prejudice is doubtful. Ordinarily, this would be viewed as a matter of speculation and therefore not lead to recovery at all. What distinguishes this category of damages and rescues the claimant's prospects for recovery is that the possibility of profits itself has a value. The paradigm case is *Sapphire*, which involved the cancellation of rights to explore and exploit any hydrocarbon resources found in a specific area. At the time of the breach, there was no way of knowing whether there would be any discovery of commercial value. Yet the chance itself had a value; a third party would have paid something for the licensee's rights\".439\n\nSee, for instance: *Sapphire v. NIOC*, Award of 15 March 1963, p. 187-188; *SPP v. Egypt,* Award of 20 May 1990, \u00b6\u00b6 214-216; and *Gemplus v. Mexico*, Award of 16 June 2010, \u00b6 13.98 (\"In the Tribunal's view, there was therefore as at 24 June 2001 no certainty or realistic expectation of this project's profitability as originally envisaged, but there was nonetheless a reasonable opportunity. That opportunity, however small, has a monetary value for the purpose of Article 36 of the ILA Articles and the indemnities for compensation provided by the two BITs\").\n\nThis is reflected for instance in Article 7.4.3(2) of the UNIDROIT Principles, according to which \"[c]ompensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of is occurrence\". See also: *Gemplus v. Mexico*, Award of 16 June 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 13.96-13,100.\n\nJ. Paulsson, \"The Expectation Model\", in Y. Derains, R.H. Kreindler (eds), *Evaluation of Damages in International Arbitration*, Dossier IV from the ICC Institute of World Business Law, ICC Publication No 668 (2006), p. 66.\n\n280.\n\nHere, while Burlington and its legal expert appear to accept that this claim is for the loss of an opportunity,440 Burlington has not quantified the value of that opportunity.441 It claims, rather, the full value of the lost profits which it would allegedly have obtained had the contract been extended (under the terms envisaged by Mr. Moyes).442\n\nSee, for instance: Mem., Title IV C (\"Lost Opportunities: Ecuador Is Obligated To Compensate Burlington For The Lost Opportunity To Negotiate An Extension Of The Block 7 PSC\"); Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 822:4-22 (Cross of Dr. Aguilar, Blackaby) (\"Mr. Aguilar, I'm not saying that there is a right. I understood that we agree that there is an opportunity. It could be a lost opportunity. And if that opportunity did not exist\u2014let's say I buy a ticket for a lottery. That gives me the opportunity to win or lose\"); Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 721:1021 (Cross, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose) (\"The right of the Consortium is to see its Contract renewed or extended should one of the three conditions described in the Contract are met, and the State itself says that if one of those conditions is met, the interests of the State would be wholly satisfied. In such a case, the Contract would be extended. That is the right. At least a legitimate expectation that if one of the conditions stipulated in the Contract is, indeed, met, then the Minister or Petroecuador or whoever the official public authority is would extend the Contract. That is my position\").\n\nAlthough at the Hearing Mr. Moyes suggested that the Tribunal could adjust the value to 87.5% (because he had testified that 7 out of 8 contracts had been extended), and Burlington's counsel further suggested that the Tribunal could in its discretion decide to award 60 or 70% of the amount claimed, Burlington's claim is for the total amount of the profits to be generated by the extension. See: Compass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 55-63.\n\nSee, for instance: Compass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 55-63.\n\n281.\n\nWhile the Tribunal could possibly attempt to assess the lost opportunity in monetary terms, it finds that it would be too speculative for it to do so in the circumstances and on the basis of the evidence before it. Indeed, as noted above, the State had discretion to decide whether the contract would have been extended, within the limits set out in the PSCs themselves, and this discretion involved the delicate assessment of the best interests of the State. Hence, even if the Tribunal were to find that the economic terms proposed by Mr. Moyes were reasonable, there is no way for the Tribunal on its own to assess the probability that the contract would have been extended, or on what terms. The Tribunal notes in this regard that it is not prepared to rely on other contracts that were extended by Ecuador. In particular, the Tribunal considers that the Repsol-Murphy contract and the AGIP contract are not comparable because they were already service contracts (AGIP) or presupposed acceptance of Law 42 payments (Repsol-Murphy).443\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 180-186, citing: Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 974:19-975:1 (Cross, Moyes) and (Day 5) (ENG), 1494:15-21 (Closing, Silva Romero).\n\n282.\n\nNor can the Tribunal fail to observe that, at the relevant time, Burlington itself appears to have assigned zero value to the chance of a contract extension. Indeed, while the 2007 Sales Memorandum recognized the possibility of a contract extension,444 it did not project any production beyond the original term of the Block 7 PSC, i.e., August 2010.445\n\nThe 2007 Sales Memorandum stated that \"[a]n extension is possible, especially with a commitment to enhance the productivity of the field beyond the continuation of a standard drilling program. An offer to conduct pressure maintenance via water injection may be attractive to Petroecuador and could be an enticement for a contract extension. It is thought that any new field discovered will receive an automatic term extension to 2017\" (**Exh. E-214**).\n\nSee: 2007 Sales Memorandum, Appendix 8, p. 67 (**Exh. E-214**).\n\n283.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Burlington's damages claim for the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC.\n\nD. **Valuation**\n----------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the valuation of the expropriated assets, i.e., the value of the PSCs going forward, as identified in the previous sections. As noted above, Ecuador agrees that this is a compensable loss, but argues that Burlington's claim is grossly inflated.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal will first provide an overview of the Parties' positions and their experts' opinions (Section 1). It will then address the valuation method (Section 2), the date of valuation (Section 3), and whether the economic effects of Law 42 should be accounted for (Section 4). It will then proceed to the computation of cash flows, assessing the different variables needed to determine revenues and costs, as well as the applicable actualization and discount rates (Section 5). Finally, the Tribunal will review Burlington's claim that the award must be protected against taxation (Section 6).\n\n**1. Overview of the Parties' valuations**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1.1 Overview of Burlington's valuation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nBurlington submits that the value of the PSCs is equivalent to the lost profits \"from the production foregone\" that it would have received under the PSCs absent the expropriation.\n\n287.\n\nRelying on the full reparation standard, Burlington values these lost profits at the date of the award. As a result, its lost production can be broken down in two elements:446\n\ni. Past lost profits, i.e., lost profits that would have accrued from December 2007 until the date of the award, with an interest factor applied to actualize the cash flows to present value. Compass Lexecon refers to these as \"historical lost profits\". The Tribunal will refer to them as \"past lost profits\".\n\nii. Future lost profits, i.e., lost profits that would have accrued from the date of the award until the expiry of the PSCs, discounted to present value. Compass Lexecon refers to these as the \"fair market value\" at the date of the valuation. To simplify, the Tribunal will refer to them as \"future lost profits\".\n\nMem., \u00b6 74.\n\n288.\n\nApplying accepted principles of corporate finance, Compass Lexecon undertook a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analysis, simulating in its view the analysis that would have been undertaken by willing buyers and sellers \"with a long-term investment perspective\", on the basis of the following elements:\n\ni. Future cash flows were discounted to the valuation date at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the project, which \"represents the opportunity cost of funding the operations of the PSCs\". Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Compass Lexecon calculates the WACC of the project at 12.1% in its First Report (with a valuation date in May 2013) and 12.5% in its Second Report (with a valuation date in September 2014).\n\nii. Historical lost cash flows were \"actualized\" to the valuation date through the application of interest at the same rate;\n\niii. All lost profits were calculated net of the economic effects of Law 42, i.e., based on the assumption that Ecuador would have complied with its obligations under the PSCs;\n\niv. Production was calculated \"as it would have been, but for the crushing effects of Ecuador's breaches\". Accordingly, the lost profits analysis starts in December 2007, when the Consortium ceased all investment in the Blocks as a result of the 99% tax following Decree 662. Burlington explains that Compass Lexecon correctly assumes that, in such a \"but for\" scenario the Consortium would have continued investing rather than decreasing and eventually ceasing its investment in the Blocks.447 Specifically, Compass Lexecon bases its projections on Mr. Crick's production forecasts, which Compass Lexecon has found to be consistent with the information on actual production and reserves produced by Ecuador from early 2010 onwards.448\n\nv. Compass Lexecon forecasts future crude oil prices using North Sea Brent Crude (Brent) prices as a marker for Oriente crude (the crude oil produced by Block 7) and Napo crude (the crude oil produced by Block 21) prices. To forecast Brent prices, Compass Lexecon uses a median of projections published by industry analysts and US government agencies. After reviewing the historical relationship between Brent prices and Oriente/Napo prices, Compass Lexecon computes expected price paths for Oriente and Napo crudes from the date of valuation until the expected expiration of the PSCs.449\n\nvi. Compass Lexecon assumes operating costs (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX) that are consistent with the Consortium's historical expenditures, updated with US PPI. With respect to the existing wells on Block 21, it also bases its projections on historical operating, drilling, and maintenance costs as incurred by the Consortium. With respect to the additional developments and production from new wells projected by Mr. Crick, Compass Lexecon uses \"information on required investment costs based on Mr. Crick's calculations\", and estimates \"variable operating costs (on a per barrel basis) that increase proportionally to the volumes of fluids produced in line with the expected ratio of water to crude oil fluid extraction\".450\n\nMem., \u00b6 77.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 5.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 7.\n\n289.\n\nCompass Lexecon also makes certain assumptions with respect to prices, taxation and others, which are discussed in the sections below.\n\n290.\n\nUsing the methodology and assumptions described above, in its Second Report Compass Lexecon values Burlington's claim at **USD 811.1 million**. In the Model submitted by both experts, this claim is updated to **USD 753.5 million** with a date of valuation of 31 March 2015.451 In the Updated Model this amount is stated to be **USD 840,954,354**, including pre-award interest.\n\nIf Compass Lexecon's assumptions are chosen as inputs in the Model, the item \"Value of Operating Assets\" amounts to **USD 753,533,729** with a valuation date of 31 March 2015.\n\n291.\n\nBurlington asserts that its experts have employed reasonable production estimates to calculate the financial consequences of Ecuador's unlawful conduct and that these estimates have been \"fully validated\" by documents Ecuador was obliged to produce in these proceedings.452 Burlington states that it seeks no more than the fair market value of its investment according to production volumes and estimates \"according to Ecuador's own figures\".453\n\nReply, \u00b6 2.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**1.2 Overview of Ecuador's valuation**\n---------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nEcuador acknowledges that Burlington has a right to compensation for the value of the PSCs, but contends that its claim is grossly inflated. According to Ecuador and its expert, Fair Links, once the FMV of the PSCs is properly calculated, Burlington's claim for lost profits shrinks to USD 26.3 million.454\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 451.\n\n293.\n\nEcuador agrees that damages correspond to the FMV of its lost investment and that the DCF is the proper method in the present case. However, it argues that Burlington's valuation misapplies the relevant standards of compensation under the Treaty and international law, is based on false assumptions, and applies an exaggerated interest rate. In particular, it argues that:\n\ni. The appropriate standard of compensation is that provided under Article III of the Treaty, that is, the fair market value of Burlington's investment on the date of the expropriation, plus interest up to the date of payment (both under the Treaty and customary international law). The customary international law principle of full reparation does not apply to this case.\n\nii. Burlington wrongly uses the date of the award as date of valuation, when it should use the date of the expropriation.\n\niii. Fair Links calculated the FMV of Burlington's investment in the Blocks at USD 26.3 million (excluding interest) \"considering all the information available as of the date of expropriation\".\n\niv. Burlington fails to account for Law 42 taxes when projecting future profits.\n\nv. The interest rate used to actualize past lost profits can only be a risk-free rate, as opposed to the WACC.\n\n294.\n\nEcuador takes particular issue with Burlington's application of interest, which Ecuador points out amounts to USD 366 million out of a total valuation of USD 811.1 million.455\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n295.\n\nFinally, Ecuador acknowledges that, besides the interest rate, the other value drivers chosen by Compass Lexecon have \"a lesser impact\" on the calculation of the FMV. The values for CAPEX, OPEX, oil prices, and oil production volumes adopted by Compass Lexecon \"only affect Fair Links' base case by USD 9.9 million, increasing it from USD 26.3 million to USD 36.2 million\".456\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 660-661, referring to: Fair Links ER2, \u00b6 122, Figure 11.\n\n**2. The DCF valuation method**\n-------------------------------\n\n**2.1 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n296.\n\nBurlington requests the Tribunal to apply the DCF methodology to quantify its lost profits claim. According to Burlington, to calculate the FMV of a going concern with an established track record of historical cash flows, the future profit-making potential of the investment must be taken into account.457 As explained by Compass Lexecon, the DCF method is the most appropriate technique in present circumstances, since it ascertains the value of an asset on the basis of expected future cash flows, taking into account the risk and the time value of money.458 This method has been applied by most recent awards and has become the industry standard for valuing oil and gas interests.459 For instance, in *CMS*, the tribunal held the DCF method to be \"universally adopted\". The *Walter Bau* tribunal deemed it to be the \"only method that can accurately track value through time\".460 In *Occidental II*, DCF was called the \"standard economic approach\".461 Accordingly, expected free cash flows generated under the PSCs, \"absent [i.e., \u2018but for'] unlawful government conduct\", must be discounted \"at a rate reflecting the business's costs of raising capital and the appropriate levels of risk\".462\n\nMem., \u00b6 148.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 149. Burlington further explains that a \"forward-looking DCF valuation is not the same as a calculation of damages for lost profits. It is simply a calculation of the fair market value of the asset by reference to the future earnings potential of the asset\". *Id*., note 203.\n\nMem., \u00b6 151, referring in particular to: *Occidental v. Ecuador II,* Award of 5 October 2012, \u00b6 779 (**Exh. CL-240**).\n\nMem., \u00b6 152, citing: *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8 (\" *CMS v.

CL-240**).\n\nMem., \u00b6 150.\n\n**2.2 Ecuador's position**\n--------------------------\n\n297.\n\nEcuador agrees that the DCF method is the proper method in the present case.463 Its expert, Fair Links, notes that \"[t]he DCF approach is a widely accepted and implemented valuation method to determine the Fair Market Value of an asset\".464 Ecuador does not agree, however, that the FMV is \"simply a proxy for the lost future cash flows\", since under certain circumstances \"lost future cash flows operate as a proxy for FMV\", and argues that Compass Lexecon has admitted to calculating the value of future cash flows, not the FMV of Burlington's investment.465\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 454.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 40.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 455.\n\n298.\n\nIn addition, for Ecuador, Compass Lexecon calculates the FMV by misrepresenting the impact of various variables. Compass Lexecon \"considers the value drivers underlying a DCF valuation in a sequence that is not in keeping with how a DCF is built\". For instance, Burlington's expert considers taxation \u2013 Law 42 \u2013 before considering oil production and oil prices, and thus does not show its full impact. Nor does it show the full impact of applying an exaggerated 12.5% interest (actualization) rate until the date of the award.466 Both Law 42 and interest should be considered \"at the end of the sequence once revenue (production and price) are determined\".467 Indeed, when these value drivers are analyzed in the correct order, \"it becomes clear that the key differences in the Parties' damages calculations are (i) the application of Law 42 (a USD 409 million impact) and (ii) Burlington's use of an exaggerated 12.5% actualization rate to calculate pre-judgment interest (a USD 366 million impact)\".468 By contrast, the other parameters (such as price, production, CAPEX, OPEX and discount rate) have a lesser impact.469\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 576.\n\n*Ibid*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 577, referring to: Fair Links ER2, \u00b6 60.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 578.\n\n**2.3 Analysis**\n----------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Parties agree that Burlington's investment should be valued using the DCF method. The Tribunal concurs: as both Parties' experts have noted, the DCF method is widely accepted as an appropriate method to value going concerns, and has been endorsed by the World Bank.470\n\nThe World Bank considers that the determination of compensation for the FMV of a going concern with a proven record of profitability will be deemed reasonable if undertaken on the basis of the discounted cash flow value. World Bank (1992), \"Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment\", Foreign Investment Law Journal, Chapter IV Expropriation and unilateral alterations or termination of contracts, paragraphs 5 and 6 (**Exh. CLEX-12**).\n\n300.\n\nThe DCF method is an income-based valuation method. As Fair Links has explained, this method \"values an asset by considering its ability to generate future economic benefits\".471 As Compass Lexecon puts it, \"[b]usinesses have value because they are expected to produce net cash flows to the investor at some point. The DCF approach determines value on a particular date on the basis of the net cash flows that the asset is expected to generate over time\".472 Similarly, Fair Links explains that \"[u]nder this approach, the value of an asset is related to its expected economic benefit, i.e. the remaining cash available to the investor or creditor once the operating costs and capital expenditure of the asset have been paid. Assessing these expected economic benefits allows one to determine the \u2018free cash flows' generated by the asset\".473\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 40.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 17.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 41.\n\n301.\n\nDespite this, Ecuador appears to take issue with Compass Lexecon's use of free cash flows. The Tribunal is somewhat puzzled by this comment, as both Parties' experts expressly agree on the use of the DCF method and thus necessarily agree on valuing the investment on the basis of its future cash flows. The Tribunal thus dismisses Ecuador's objection, to the extent that it is one.\n\n302.\n\nAlthough there is agreement on the method of valuation, the Parties' disagree on several variables and assumptions to be used to perform the valuation, in particular the date of valuation and whether the experts should use *ex ante* or *ex post* data, and as well as the actualization rate to apply to past cash flows. The Tribunal addresses these assumptions and variables in the following sections.\n\n303.\n\nEcuador also objects to the sequence used by Compass Lexecon in its DCF calculation. The Tribunal addresses this objection in Section VII.D.5.2.6 below.\n\n**3. Date of valuation**\n------------------------\n\n**3.1 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n304.\n\nAs explained in Section VII.B.1 above, Burlington submits that the standard of compensation in cases of unlawful expropriation is the international law principle of full reparation. Since an award of compensation must take the place of restitution, it is \"appropriate and logical to value the investment at the date of the award\".474\n\nMem., \u00b6 58; Reply, \u00b6 23, citing: E. Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga, \"International Responsibility\", in M. S0rensen, *Manual Of Public International Law* (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1968), \u00b6 9.18 (**Exh. CL-260**).\n\n305.\n\nAccording to Burlington, this was the position adopted by the PCIJ in *Chorz\u00f4w,* where the Court held that the wrongdoer should pay the value of the undertaking \"at the time of the indemnification\".475 This approach was adopted in other cases such as *Unglaube*, *Kardassopoulos*, and *ADC*, and was again recently confirmed by the *Yukos* tribunal.\n\nMem., \u00b6 59, citing: *Chorz\u00f4w,* p. 48 (**Exh.

CL-259**).\n\n306.\n\nTribunals, such as in *ADC*, have particularly used this valuation date where the value of the assets taken increased after the expropriation \"due to objective factors, such as improving market conditions\".476 Adopting another date, says Burlington, would allow Ecuador to retain the increase in value and would thereby create \"perverse incentives, financially rewarding a State for its own unlawful conduct\".477 Burlington argues that in the present case it is particularly important to compensate for any increase in value, as this increase \"is attributable to subsurface conditions known by the investor at the time of expropriation but not fully exploited due to the economic disincentives created by the State's unlawful conduct\".478\n\nMem., \u00b6 61, referring to: *ADC v. Hungary,* Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 496-497 (**Exh. CL-** **101**).\n\nMem., \u00b6 62.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 64.

Hungary,* Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 496-499 (**Exh. CL-101**) ; *CMS v. Argentina,* Award of 12 May 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 441-447 (**Exh. CL-99**).\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 67:6-68-20 (Opening, Blackaby).\n\n308.\n\nFor Burlington, the date of the award is the appropriate date of valuation regardless of the nature of the unlawfulness that taints the expropriation. Whether the State failed to make compensation or breached any of the \"conduct\" requirements of the Treaty is irrelevant. The case law confirms this point. In *ConocoPhillips*, the expropriation was unlawful because of the failure to comply with the compensation standard under the treaty, and the tribunal valued the investment on the date of the award.481 Similarly, in *Unglaube*, the tribunal held that Costa Rica's failure to offer adequate and timely compensation was sufficient in itself to make the expropriation unlawful, triggering the application of the customary international law standard.482\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, citing: *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 342-343, 401 (**Exh. CL-343**) ; and Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 38-41, referring to: *Unglaube v.

Zimbabwe,* Award of 22 April 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 107 (**Exh. CL-150**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 38.\n\n309.\n\nEcuador's attempts to discard these \"settled principles\" so as to minimize the amount of damages are misplaced.483 As discussed in Section VII.B.1 above, Burlington is of the view that the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which distinguishes between \"inherently unlawful dispossession\" and expropriation unlawful for failure to pay compensation, provides little guidance in investment disputes.484\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 24, referring to: CM, \u00b6\u00b6 347-351.\n\nReply, \u00b6 47.\n\n310.\n\nWith respect to investment case law and doctrine, Ecuador's arguments are equally unavailing and unpersuasive. Burlington stresses that, while the tribunal in *Rurelec* took the date of the taking as the date of valuation, that solution resulted from the plaintiff's choice of that specific date for the valuation.485 Furthermore, it should be noted that the tribunal did hold the taking to be unlawful for lack of payment, notwithstanding the fact that Bolivia made efforts to seek a solution.486 And in *Funnekotter*, the date of the award was not used because the value of the farms had not increased in the meantime. That decision rather supports the opinion that the date that best assures full reparation should be adopted.487 Moreover, reliance on *Santa Elena* is misplaced since that case concerned a lawful taking in which the state recognized that compensation was due and the only issue to be determined was the amount of compensation owed.488\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 51; referring to: *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2011-17 (\" *Rurelec v. Bolivia\")*, Award of 31 January 2014, \u00b6 410 (**Exh. El-260**).

There, the tribunal held that the co-investors likely would have bought the plaintiff's investment. In the present case, to the contrary, by the time of the taking \"it was clear that Burlington was *not* going to sell its interests in Ecuador, regardless of Burlington's preference\".490 As Mr. Martinez confirmed, prospective purchasers rescinded their offers after the introduction of Decree 662, and with the seizures it became clear that \"Burlington had no option but to retain its investment\".491 Hence, whether Burlington wished to sell its investment prior to the taking is irrelevant to the question whether it \"would or could have done so, but for the expropriation, in the period between the expropriation date and the date of award\".492\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 72, referring to: CM, \u00b6 368; *Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v.

Ecuador*,493 Burlington contends that the relevance of this decision is overstated because it did not concern an expropriation claim and because its findings (in particular its decision not to rely on *ex-post* data), \"are entirely dependent on the unique factual circumstances of that case\".494 In particular, the tribunal held that, because *Murphy* had sold its interest, actual postsale production under new contractual conditions was not an appropriate proxy for *Murphy's* but-for scenario. For Burlington, *Murphy* \"supports the principle that *expost* data should be used to determine the value of an investment when that data reflects the but-for scenario, as is the case in this arbitration\",495 and confirms that \" *ex-post* data can properly be used to validate ex-ante assumptions\", as is the case here.496 Burlington stresses that \"Mr. Crick's projections were first prepared in the absence of the Petroamazonas data. Ecuador then produced that data, which proved to line up almost perfectly with Mr. Crick's projections. Moreover, even if this Tribunal were to follow the *Murphy* tribunal's decision not to use *ex post* information, the result would be the same because Mr. Crick's projections yield results fully consistent with the actual performance of the Blocks in Ecuador's hands and as assessed by Ryder Scott, *even when Mr. Crick's inputs are limited to technical data available up to July 2009* \".497\n\n*Murphy Exploration & Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador* (PCA Case No. AA434) *(\"Murphy v. Ecuador\"),* Partial Final Award of 6 May 2016 (**Exh.

Accordingly, in its first expert report, Compass Lexecon used 30 April 2013 as the proxy date; in its second report, 15 September 2014, and in the Updated Model, 31 August 2016.\n\n314.\n\nBy contrast, says Burlington, Ecuador's instructions to Fair Links to employ the date of expropriation for valuation purposes must be rejected. Fair Links' entire damage analysis is flawed because it relied on old and incorrect data (production forecast, oil price forecast, CAPEX figures), that are inconsistent with actual figures.498\n\nReply, \u00b6 133.\n\n**3.2 Ecuador's position**\n--------------------------\n\n315.\n\nFor Ecuador, it is clear that under both the BIT standard and customary international law Burlington's interests in Blocks 7 and 21 must be valued on the date of the \"purported expropriation\", as the expropriation at issue here was held to be unlawful by the Tribunal solely for lack of compensation.499\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 461.\n\n316.\n\nAs noted in Section VII.B.2 above, Ecuador argues that the standard of compensation is set out in Article III(1) of the Treaty. That provision makes clear that the FMV of the expropriated asset is to be calculated on the date of the expropriation:\n\n\"Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment ***immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier*** ; be calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate ***from the date of expropriation*** ; be fully realizable and be freely transferable\".500\n\nArticle III(1) of the Treaty (emphasis added).\n\n317.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, this is particularly the case for expropriations that are unlawful only for failure to pay compensation, as is the case here. This is confirmed by the reference to interest from the date of the expropriation.501\n\nSee: Section VII.B.2 above.\n\n318.\n\nEcuador contends that customary international law leads to the same result. According to Ecuador, \"Burlington continues to devote the entirety of its analysis to an assessment of compensation under customary international law without making the distinction at the heart of the foundational case on which its analysis purports to rest\",502 i.e. the *Chorz\u00f4w* case. In that case, the PCIJ drew a fundamental distinction between expropriations that would have been lawful had compensation been paid, and expropriations that would have been unlawful even if payment had been made. The PCIJ \"went out of its way to clarify that it is where the wrongful act consists of the failure to pay compensation for the taking that customary international law limits compensation \u2018to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment'\".503\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 499.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 499.\n\n319.\n\nEcuador also points to the ECtHR's distinction between \"inherently unlawful dispossession\" and \"per se illegal dispossessions\", while some commentators refer to expropriations unlawful only by virtue of failure to pay compensation as only \"unlawful *sub modo* \" or \"provisionally unlawful\".504 Ecuador emphasizes that \"[t]he point of principle lies [\u2026] not in the characterization of the taking, but in the universal recognition that the phenomena being described is different from (and has a different remedial response to) expropriations which would have been unlawful regardless of whether compensation was paid\".505\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 500, referring to: *Scordino v.

Despite Burlington's arguments, *ConocoPhillips* is not such a case, because the tribunal held the expropriation to be unlawful not because of lack of compensation, but because Venezuela breached the BIT requirement to engage in good faith negotiations over the amount of compensation.506 Nor can Burlington rely on *Siemens*, *ADC* or *Kardassopoulos*, which all involved expropriations that were unlawful for reasons other than failure to pay compensation.507 Nor does *Funnekotter* assist Burlington; in that case the value of the investment had not changed between the date of the taking and the date of the award, so the tribunal found that the differences in computation for lawful and unlawful expropriation were not at issue.508 Finally, Burlington's \"blind reliance\" on *Yukos* is also misplaced, as that was \"manifestly not a case in which the taking was unlawful only because it was unaccompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation\".509\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 504, referring to: *ConocoPhillips v.

CL-384**).\n\n321.\n\nIn the present case, according to Ecuador, the Tribunal found the expropriation to be unlawful solely due to Ecuador's failure to pay compensation. As a result, whether the Tribunal applies the treaty standard or customary international law, Burlington is only entitled to compensation of its investment valued on the date of the expropriation plus interest.510\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 512.\n\n322.\n\nIn any event, Burlington cannot purport to profit from the alleged increased value of the asset after the date of expropriation. For Ecuador, \"[c]ompensation for increased value between the date of the expropriation and the date of the award is premised on the fact that the investor intended to keep the asset\".511 This was confirmed in *Kardassopoulos*, where the tribunal clearly stated that this rationale only applies \"in cases where it is demonstrated that the Claimants would, but for the taking, have retained their investment\".512 This is not the case here: the evidence in the record shows that even before Law 42 came into effect, Burlington had the intention to sell its interest in the Blocks, and continued to seek to do so in 2007 and 2008.513\n\nCM, \u00b6 368.\n\n*Ibid.,* referring to: *Kardassopoulos v.

Ecuador*514 to argue that the Tribunal must value the expropriated investment on the date of the expropriation. Ecuador emphasizes that the *Murphy* decision \"deals with exactly the same legal issues and the same factual background that this Tribunal is currently dealing with\".515 Ecuador notes in particular that the *Murphy* tribunal applied the Treaty governing in the present case and analyzed the impact of Law 42 on similar participation contracts, albeit in the context of breaches to Article III(2) of the Treaty. For Ecuador, *Murphy* supports a valuation on the date of the expropriation using *ex ante* information because that tribunal:\n\ni. \"[D]ecided that, whilst *Chorzow* was applicable in that case, the full reparation standard aims at \u2018full reparation' of the concrete and actual damage incurred and that it provides a large margin of appreciation to tribunals with respect to the selection of an appropriate valuation method\", and\n\nii. \"[F]ound that an *ex-post* approach was not appropriate because the ex-post data generated after March 2009 (such as oil price and production data) did not reflect what the situation would have been in a but-for scenario\".516\n\n*Murphy v.

EL-424**).\n\nEcuador's letter of 7 July 2016 (emphasis in the original).\n\nEcuador's letter of 7 July 2016 (emphasis in the original).\n\n324.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, Ecuador submits that, if compensation is due, it should be based on the value of the investment on the date of the expropriation (i.e., 30 August 2009) using *ex ante* information, plus interest.\n\n**3.3 Analysis**\n----------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that the standard of compensation in this case is the full reparation principle under customary international law. It has also clarified that it need not determine whether the standard of compensation under customary international law is different for expropriations that are unlawful solely as a result of the failure to pay compensation as opposed to expropriations that are unlawful on other grounds (*see* paragraph 176 above), given that Ecuador's expropriation of Burlington's investment was unlawful not only as a result of Ecuador's failure to pay compensation, but also because the expropriation was not done in accordance with other conditions for a lawful expropriation.\n\n326.\n\nIn the majority's view, the full reparation standard requires that the damages resulting from the unlawful act be valued on the date of the award, using information available at that point in time. This conclusion derives from the *Chorz\u00f3w* case, where the PCIJ stated that, in cases where the State's wrongful act was not limited to failure to pay compensation, the compensation to be awarded \"is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of the dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment\".517 According to the Court, \"[t]his limitation would only be admissible if the Polish Government had the right to expropriate, and if its wrongful act consisted merely in not having paid to the two Companies the just price of what was expropriated\".518 By contrast, when the expropriation is unlawful,519 the State is required to make full reparation for the injury caused, and this \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".520 According to the Court, this \"involves the obligation to restore the undertaking and, if this be not possible, to pay its value *at the time of the indemnification*, which value is designed to take the place of restitution which has become impossible\".521 The Court highlighted that to conclude otherwise would be \"tantamount to rendering lawful liquidation and unlawful dispossession indistinguishable in so far as their financial results are concerned\".522\n\n*Chorz\u00f4w,* p. 47 (**Exh. CL-102**). The PCIJ reiterates this principle when rejecting the use of a previously negotiated contract price or offer of sale. The PCIJ states that \"[i]t has already been pointed out above that the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession does not necessarily indicate the criterion for the fixing of compensation. Now it is certain that the moment of the contract of sale and that of the negotiations with the Genevese Company belong to a period of serious economic and monetary crisis; the difference between the value which the undertaking then had and that which it would have had at present may therefore be very considerable\". *Id.*, p. 50.\n\n*Id.,* p. 47 (**Exh. CL-102**).\n\nThe Court refers to \"[t]he dispossession of an industrial undertaking \u2013 the expropriation of which is prohibited by the Geneva Convention \u2013 [\u2026]\". *Id.*, pp. 47-48.\n\n*Id.*, p. 48.\n\n*Ibid.* (emphasis added).\n\n*Id*., p. 47.\n\n327.\n\nThe Court's task was thus to determine \"what sum must be awarded [\u2026] to place the dispossessed Companies as far as possible in the economic situation in which they would probably have been if the seizure had not taken place\".523 To this end, the Court requested an expert to conduct two valuations: one based on the asset value of the undertaking on the date of the taking plus any additional profits accrued until the date of the judgment (Question I),524 and another based on the asset value of the undertaking on the date of the judgment (Question II).525 Both valuations had the same purpose, which was to establish the value of the losses suffered by the dispossessed companies on the date of the Court's judgment. The losses on the date of the judgment could be assessed either by reference to the value of the undertaking on the date of the taking plus any lost profits accrued between the taking and the judgment, or by reference to the value of the undertaking on the date of the judgment. Although the Court did not use a DCF computation but an asset-based valuation, under both valuations it would have awarded the value of the losses on the date of the judgment.526\n\n*Id*., p. 49.\n\nIn Question I, the Court requested the expert to establish the value of the undertaking on the date of the expropriation on the basis of its assets, as well as the financial results (profits or losses) that would have accrued from the date of the taking to the date of the judgment. It did so in the following terms: \"I.- A. What was the value, on July 3rd, 1922, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the undertaking for the manufacture of nitrate products of which the factory was situated at Chorzow in Polish Upper Silesia, in the state in which that undertaking (including the lands, buildings, equipment, stocks and processes at its disposal, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) was, on the date indicated, in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke?  \n B. What would have been the financial results, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time (profits or losses), which would probably have been given by the undertaking thus constituted from July 3rd, 1922, to the date of the present judgment, if it had been in the hands of the said Companies?\". *Id.*, p. 51.\n\nIn Question II, the Court requested the expert to establish the value of the undertaking on the date of the judgment if that undertaking (considering all of its assets) had remained in the hands of the dispossessed companies and had either remained substantially as it had been on the date of the taking or had developed in a similar fashion as other undertakings of the same kind. It did so in the following terms: \"II.- What would be the value at the date of the present judgment, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the same undertaking (Chorzow) if that undertaking (including lands, buildings, equipment, stocks, available processes, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) had remained in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke, and had either remained substantially as it was in 1922 or had been developed proportionately on lines similar to those applied in the case of other undertakings of the same kind, controlled by the Bayerische, for instance, the undertaking of which the factory is situated at Piesteritz?\". *Id.,* pp. 51-52.\n\nSee in particular: *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Award of 16 September 2015, \u00b6 374. See also: *Amoco v. Iran*, Partial Award No ITL 310-56-3 of 14 July 1987, 15 IRAN-U.S. CTR 189, \u00b6\u00b6 198-206 (**Exh. CL-173**).\n\n328.\n\nAfter recognizing the difficulties of this exercise, especially considering \"the time that elapsed between the dispossession and the demand for compensation, and with the transformations of the factory and the progress made in the industry with which the factory is concerned\",527 the Court \"reserve[d] every right to review the valuations referred to in the different formulae; basing itself on the results of the said valuations and of facts and documents submitted to it, it will then proceed to determine the sum to be awarded to the German Government, in conformity with the legal principles set out above\".528\n\n*Chorz\u00f4w,* p. 53 (**Exh. CL-102**).\n\n*Id.,* pp. 53-54.\n\n329.\n\nThe *Chorz\u00f3w* case settled thereafter, with the result that we do not know how the Court would have determined the amount of damages. However, three fundamental conclusions can be drawn from the Court's ruling: (i) under the full reparation principle, damages should be a substitute for restitution that has become impossible; (ii) because damages must replace restitution, they should be valued on the date on which compensation is awarded; and (iii) tribunals have full discretion to assess the valuations for purposes of determining the amount to be awarded.\n\n330.\n\nOn this basis, the majority concludes that where the expropriation was unlawful for several reasons, including the failure to pay compensation (as is the case here), the appropriate valuation date is the date of the award or a proxy for that date \u2013 it being noted once again that here it is not necessary to determine whether a different standard is called for where the unlawfulness results solely from a failure to pay compensation. Other investment tribunals529 and adjudicatory bodies (including the ECtHR),530 as well as several scholars,531 have come to the same conclusion.\n\nSee, for instance: *ADC v. Hungary,* Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 497 (**Exh. CL-101**) ; *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,* Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013, \u00b6 343 (**Exh. CL-343**) ; *Yukos v.

Argentina,* Award of 6 February 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 322-389 (**Exh. CL-79**), where although the tribunal endorsed the view that the principle of full reparation required awarding the value of the investment on the date of the award, it was ultimately guided by the claimant's request for relief, which sought the book value of the investment at the time of the expropriation plus lost profits and other consequential damages arisen thereafter.\n\nSee, for instance: *Amoco v. Iran,* Partial Award of 14 July 1987, \u00b6\u00b6 192-204 (**Exh. EL-39**) ; *Papamichalopoulos and others v. Greece,* 9 ECHR 118, Judgment of 31 October 1995, \u00b6 36. See also: I.

Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), \u00b6 3,266 (\"As unlawful expropriations represent violations of international law they entail the State's responsibility to fully repair the financial harm done to the former owner. The applicable differential method requires assessing the difference between the financial situation of the person affected and the financial situation he or she would be in, if the expropriation had not taken place. This comparison is made on the day of the judgment or award. It follows that the decisive valuation date is the date of the award\") (**Exh. EL-284**). See also: M. S0rensen, *Manual of Public International Law* (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1968) p. 567, \u00b6 9.18 (\"[s]ince monetary compensation must, as far as possible, resemble restitution, the value at the date when the indemnity is paid must be the criterion\"); and G. Schwarzenberger, *International Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals*, Vol. 1 (London: Stevens & Sons Limited, 1957), p. 666 (\"[m]uch is to be said in favour of the date of the judgment as the operative date. It is the judgment or award which establishes between the parties with binding force that reparation is due from one party to the other. If restitution in kind were possible, it would have to take place as soon as possible after the judgment or award. It, therefore, appears appropriate that the amount of any monetary substitute for actual restitution should be related to the same date\") (**Exh. CL-258**).\n\n331.\n\nIt is true that Ecuador has submitted that Burlington cannot benefit from increases in the value of its investment after the expropriation because it was in any event seeking to sell Blocks 7 and 21. In support of this argument, Ecuador relies on *Kardassopoulos*, where the tribunal stated that \"[i]t may be appropriate to compensate for value gained between the date of the expropriation and the date of the award in cases where it is demonstrated that the Claimants would, but for the taking, have retained their investment\".532 It is undisputed that Burlington was trying to sell its investment prior to the enactment of Law 42 and continued to do so at least until 2007.533 However, Burlington was unable to sell, and this failure was due at least in part to the increasingly hostile environment for oil investments in Ecuador. As a result, but for the expropriation, the Tribunal accepts on the basis of the record that Burlington would in fact have kept its investment.\n\n*Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* Award of 3 March 2010, \u00b6 514 (**Exh. CL-261**).\n\nMr. Martinez testified during the hearing on provisional measures that \"Burlington Resources has attempted to sell, and actually we were fairly close to the sale prior to the enactment of Law 42, which affected that sale\" (Tr. Provisional Measures (Day 1) (ENG), 149:9-11 (Cross, Martinez)). Mr. Martinez confirmed this during the hearing on liability (Tr. Liability (ENG) (Day 2), 385:1-9 (Direct, Martinez): \"Q: Mr. Martinez, shifting gears again, Ecuador has made much of the fact that Burlington was looking to sell its interests in Blocks 7 and 21 even before Law 42 went into effect. Can you address this. Is it true that Burlington was looking to sell these two Blocks? A. We had some unsolicited offers in 2006. In 2007, we were looking to just divest of the Blocks, so, yes\").\n\n332.\n\nThe majority's conclusion on the valuation date has two implications. First, it means that the Tribunal may take into consideration information post-dating the expropriation. The Tribunal's task is to place Burlington in the situation it would have been had Ecuador not expropriated the PSCs. For this, the Tribunal must assess what the PSC's value would have been in real life on the date of the award. Such a valuation will obviously be more accurate and reliable if actual information is used in respect of relevant facts that have occurred between the expropriation and the award, rather than projections based on information available on the date of the expropriation. The valuation will be closer to reality if the Tribunal decides with \"maximum information\" rather than \"maximum ignorance\".534 The same rationale was adopted in *Amco II* :\n\n\"If the purpose of compensation is to put Amco in the position it would have been in had it received the benefits of the Profit-Sharing Agreement, then there is no reason of logic that requires that to be done by reference only to data that would have been known to a prudent businessman in 1980. It may, on one view, be the case that in a lawful taking, Amco would have been entitled to the fair market value of the contract at the moment of dispossession. In making such a valuation, a Tribunal in 1990 would necessarily exclude factors subsequent to 1980. But if Amco is to be placed as if the contract had remained in effect, then subsequent known factors bearing on that performance are to be reflected in the valuation technique. [\u2026]\".535\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1376:4-6 (Closing, Paulsson).\n\nSee: *Amco Asia v. Indonesia II*, \u00b6 186. See also: I. Marboe, *Compensation and Damages in International Law The Limits of \"Fair Market Value\"*, TDM, Vol. 4, Issue 6, November 2007, p. 753 (\"It follows, thus, from the principle of full reparation as formulated by the PCIJ in *Chorz\u00f4w Factory*, that the valuation is not normally limited to the perspective of the date of the illegal act or some other date in the past. An increase in value of the valuation object, consequential damage, subsequent events and information, at least up until the date of the judgment or award, must be taken into account in the evaluation of damages\") (**Exh. EL-** **255**).\n\n333.\n\nOne might object that using information post-dating the expropriation would somehow conflict with the requirement of causation, which is sometimes linked to foreseeability. However, the fact that some of the information used to quantify lost profits on the date of the award may not have been foreseeable on the date of the expropriation does not break the chain of causation. What matters is that the injury suffered must have been caused by the wrongful act. It is true that factual causation is not sufficient, and that an additional element linked to the exclusion of injury that is too remote or indirect (sometimes referred to as legal or adequate causation) is required, and it is in this context where foreseeability plays a role.536 If an injury was not objectively foreseeable because it was caused by an unusual chain of events that could not foreseeably derive from the act, legal causation may be absent and recovery may be excluded. However, if the injury was objectively foreseeable (i.e., because the act was objectively capable of causing the injury), then the test for both factual and legal causation will normally be met. It is generally accepted that the expropriation of a going concern is objectively capable of causing the loss of its future profit stream, and thus this loss is foreseeable. It is also foreseeable that these future profits may fluctuate depending on various economic and other variables, including prices, costs, inflation and interest rates, among others.\n\nSee: ILC Articles, Article 31, Commentary 10. (\"[C]ausality in fact is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reparation. There is a further element, associated with the exclusion of injury that is too \"remote\" or \"consequential\" to be the subject of reparation. In some cases, the criterion of \"directness\" may be used, in others \"foreseeability\" or \"proximity\").\n\n334.\n\nContrary to Ecuador's contentions, the Tribunal does not believe that the *Murphy* decision537 stands for the proposition that valuations must necessarily be carried out solely on the basis of *ex ante* information. First, the *Murphy* tribunal held that \"[t]he full reparation standard aims at \u2018full reparation' of the concrete and actual damage incurred\", and \"provides a large margin of appreciation to tribunals with respect to the selection of an appropriate valuation method\",538 two propositions that underlie the Tribunal's analysis above. Second, the *Murphy* tribunal did not say that the use of *ex post* information is proscribed; to the contrary, it held that \"an *ex-post* approach is not appropriate *in this case* because the *ex-post* data generated after the sale of Murphy Ecuador does not reflect what the situation would have been in a but-for scenario\".539\n\n*Murphy v. Ecuador,* Partial Final Award of 6 May 2016 (**Exh. EL-424**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 425. See also: \u00b6 481 (\"The applicable international law standard of full reparation, as reflected in the Chorz\u00f4w Factory judgment and Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, does not determine the valuation methodology. Nor does the Treaty. Tribunals enjoy a large margin of appreciation in order to determine how an amount of money may \u2018as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed'\").\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 484 (emphasis added). See also: \u00b6 485.\n\n335.\n\nIn the Tribunal's reading, *Murphy* thus confirms that tribunals have a large margin of appreciation in attempting to quantify the amount of compensation that will wipe out the effects of the wrongful act. If, in the circumstances of the particular case, the use of *ex post* information is relevant, reasonable and reliable, it is the majority's opinion that it should be preferred to *ex ante* information. As noted in *Quiborax*, \"[t]he Tribunal must value the loss with reasonable certainty. If the available *ex post* data is not reasonably certain, then it will have no choice but to resort to appropriately adjusted *ex ante* data [\u2026]\".540 As discussed further below, in building its counterfactual scenario the Tribunal has used *ex post* data whenever it has considered that it allows to calculate Burlington's loss with reasonable certainty.\n\n*Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Award of 16 September 2015, \u00b6 384.\n\n336.\n\nThe second implication of a valuation on the date of the award is that the Tribunal must consider two sets of lost profits: profits that would have accrued from the date of the expropriation until the date of award (past lost profits) and profits that would have accrued from the date of the award until the expiry of the contractually agreed term of the PSCs (future lost profits).541 Both sets of cash flows must be brought to present value: past cash flows must be brought forward to present value through the application of an interest rate and future cash flows must be brought to present value through the application of a discount rate. Past cash flows are calculated on the basis of information available on the date on which those cash flows would have accrued, while future cash flows are projected on the basis of the latest available information on the date of the award (or its closest proxy). The Tribunal discusses these valuations in more detail in the following sections.\n\nThe majority is aware that in *Chorz\u00f3w* the PCIJ reasoned that the valuation on the date of the judgment (Question II) would only include profits (*lucrum cessans*) between the date of the dispossession and the date of the judgment if those profits had not been absorbed in the cost of the upkeep, development and improvement of the undertaking (*Chorz\u00f3w*, p. 53). However, the PCIJ was using an asset-based valuation method, so any such profits would have been added to the value of the undertaking's assets, creating a risk of double-counting. Here, the Tribunal is using an income-based valuation method (specifically, the DCF method) that values the investment exclusively on the basis of the economic benefit it is expected to generate (see: paragraph 300 above). As a result, in the majority's view, the risk of double-counting identified by the PICJ does not arise here.\n\n337.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the majority will value the compensation due to Burlington for the unlawful expropriation of its investment on 31 August 2016 (the date used by the Parties' quantum experts in their Updated Model) as a proxy for the date of the award. Arbitrator Stern disagrees with this method of valuation.542\n\nArbitrator Stern disagrees with the analysis using *ex post* information, as well as adding profits between the date of the expropriation and the date of the award, as she is convinced that this methodology opens the way to some possible form of double counting. For further discussion, see: Partially Dissenting Opinion to the Award of 16 September 2015 in *Quiborax* *S.A. & Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2).\n\n**4. Should the economic effects of Law 42 be accounted for?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**4.1 Burlington's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n338.\n\nBurlington submits that \"in valuing Burlington's expropriated investment, [the Tribunal should] give full value to its contract rights\".543 In particular, the valuation of Burlington's lost profits should be insulated against the economic effects of Law 42. In other words, the valuation should assume that Ecuador would have complied with its tax absorption obligations under the PSCs. As a result, Burlington contends that:\n\ni. Its cash flows should be valued as if Ecuador had provided Burlington with its production share indemnified against the effects of Law 42.544\n\nii. Burlington's production should be calculated as it would have been but for the \"crushing effects of Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs\", i.e., assuming that Burlington would have continued its pre-Law 42 investment program. Consequently, when building Burlington's production profile, Compass Lexecon assumes that Burlington's drilling would have been consistent with its pre-Law 42 investment profile, as described by Mr. Crick.545 As noted above, because Burlington stopped investing in December 2007, Compass Lexecon starts its lost profits analysis on that date.546\n\nTr.

First, relying on *Occidental II* and *SPP*, Burlington argues that compensation for expropriation \"must proceed on the basis that the expropriated investment includes the contractual entitlements that were its foundation\".547 The Tribunal confirmed that the value of Burlington's investment included the right to receive its production share shielded from the economic effects of Law 42.548 Indeed, the Tribunal found that \"the contract rights under the PSCs represented a key component of Burlington's investment\", that it was \"by virtue of these contract rights that, through its subsidiary, Burlington had access to a share of the oil produced\", and that these rights had \"a direct incidence on the economic value of Burlington's investment\".549 The Tribunal further found that \"[t]he tax absorption clauses contained in the PSCs were part and parcel of the value of Burlington's investment\".550 The Tribunal need not declare Law 42 illegal or expropriatory, but Burlington has the right to be indemnified against the effects of Law 42, and that indemnity \"operated until the expiry of the PSCs\".551\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 80, referring to: *Occidental v.

As a result, \"for \u2018full reparation' to wipe out *all* of the effects of the wrongful acts, value-depressing measures taken prior to an ultimate confiscation must be excluded from the assessment of damages\".559 For instance, in *Phillips Petroleum*, the tribunal held that it \"must exclude from its calculation of compensation any diminution of value resulting from the taking of the Claimant's property or from any prior threats or actions by the Respondent related thereto\".560 Likewise, in *Amoco* the tribunal disregarded any value-depressing conduct prior to the breach.561 Similarly, *Chorz\u00f4w* 's statement that damages are \"not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession\" means that, \"in order for reparation to \u2018wipe out all the consequences' of expropriation, measures that chip away at an investment's value prior to the final taking must be taken as seriously as the final act that extinguishes the investment completely\".562 In *Sedco*, the tribunal thought it to be \"highly improper\" to discount the value of a going concern based on the State's prior wrongful conduct,563 and in *Azurix* damages were determined \"in a hypothetical context where the State would not have resorted to such maneuvers but would have fully respected the provisions of the treaty and the contract concerned\".564\n\nTr.

Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction or not over Burlington's contract claims is irrelevant. Burlington's claim is a treaty, not a contract claim. Burlington is not asking the Tribunal to uphold its contract claims under the PSCs; it is simply asking the Tribunal to compensate the value of its expropriated investments, which include its contract right to tax absorption under the PSCs.571\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 75:8-76:15, 97:10-22 (Opening, Coriell).\n\n345.\n\nIn addition, Burlington insists that, as explained in Section VII.C.1.1 above, Ecuador's argument on contractual waiver fails. The Tribunal has already held that Burlington's Subsidiaries did not waive the underlying rights and that Burlington can thus rely on them to pursue its treaty claims.572 More specifically, \"Burlington [did not] waive its Treaty right to be compensated for the full effects of Law 42\".573\n\nTr.

To value Burlington's investment on the basis of these contract rights would allow Burlington to reintroduce through the back door claims that have already been dismissed.575\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 317-339.\n\n348.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to consider that it has jurisdiction over these claims, Ecuador contends that the valuation of Burlington's investment must reflect the effects of Law 42 because (i) as a result of the waiver of contractual rights, a willing buyer could not enforce the right to be protected from the effects of Law 42, and (ii) even if the waiver argument fails, Law 42 cannot be construed as a valuedepressing measure that should be disregarded for valuation purposes.\n\n349.\n\nWith respect to (i), Ecuador submits that \"as a result of the waiver with prejudice, Burlington's alleged contractual right to be insulated against the effects of Law 42 is unenforceable and, hence, valueless\".576 This is because an hypothetical willing buyer would be placed in the same position as a willing seller, namely Burlington, whose Subsidiaries have \"waived the possibility of ever refiling their claims under the Participation Contracts in any form in the future\".577 Any willing buyer would thus be barred from enforcing the right to be indemnified against the effects of Law 42.578 According to Ecuador, this is true not only of Burlington's already existing but also of its future contract claims.579 Burlington's contention that a willing buyer could enforce new claims based on new violations of the contract rights is unavailing since the willing buyer would have \"acquired Burlington's shares in the Contract Claimants (as opposed to the Participation Contracts)\", and hence any claim brought in the future on the basis of the tax renegotiation clauses \"would still be the same claims that were waived by the Contract Claimants, and not \u2018new' claims\".580\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 135.\n\nTr.

First, a willing buyer would necessarily have taken the impact of Law 42 into account when assessing the FMV of the investment. Any valuation of Burlington's assets must take into account the impact of \"generally applicable Ecuadorian law prior to the date of expropriation\":582 Law 42 was duly enacted and its constitutionality was affirmed by the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court. As a result, a willing buyer would not have discarded its impact.583 Nor can a valuation ignore the impact of \"binding restrictions and the effects on the price of existing risks\".584 In particular, \"[m]easures similar to Law 42 are common in the petroleum industry and should be factored in when determining the price that a willing buyer may agree to pay\".585 Moreover, in its own negotiations, Burlington never hinted that the effects of Law 42 should be ignored.586 In particular, ConocoPhillips' memorandum of May 2007 for the proposed sale of its assets in Ecuador (the \"ConocoPhillips Sales Memorandum\") referred to the existence of Law 42, but did not state that the PSCs contained a tax stabilization clause that would wipe out the effects of Law 42.587 Tellingly, the offers made by prospective buyers in 2007 did take into account the impact of Law 42 in the assessment of the value of the Blocks.588\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 527-570.\n\nCM, \u00b6 395.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 531-532.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 530, referring to: M.

According to Ecuador, the Tribunal held it liable only for the failure to pay compensation to Burlington following its intervention in the Blocks.590\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 537-544.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 543, citing: DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 433, 457; Rejoinder, \u00b6 374.\n\n352.\n\nNor is Law 42 a value-depressing measure intended to diminish the value of Burlington's investment.591 The cases relied upon by Burlington are inapposite since they deal with breaches consisting of composite acts, as set out in Article 15 of the ILC Articles.592 For instance, in *Phillips Petroleum*, the tribunal dealt with a \"chain of events\", just as the *Azurix* tribunal was confronted with \"cumulative actions\" leading to the treaty breaches.593*American International* and *Sedco* make clear that \"it is only when the measures, in combination, are intended to depress the value of an investment\" that they are deemed part of a creeping expropriation.594 In the present case, the Tribunal excluded the hypothesis of creeping expropriation.595 Equally unavailing is Burlington's reliance on *Sempra* and *Enron*.

Indeed, that tribunal had jurisdiction over contract claims and held that Law 42 breached the participation contract, thus flouting the investor's legitimate expectations.597 Here, the Tribunal already held that Law 42 did not breach the PSCs or the BIT.598 Burlington's (and *Occidental II* 's) reliance on Prof. Marboe's treatise is also misguided, as the quote on which they rely relates to measures intended to depress the value of an investment just before the expropriation, which was not the case here.599 Ecuador also recalls that Prof. Stern dissented in *Occidental II*, holding that Law 42 should have been taken into account in the calculation of damages.600\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 560-561, referring to: *Occidental v.

CL-79**).\n\n355.\n\nFor these reasons, the valuation of Burlington's investment should reflect the taxation of extraordinary revenues at 99%, as well as a production profile assuming that Burlington had made and would have continued to make Law 42 payments.\n\n356.\n\nFair Links' reports show how disregarding Law 42 inflates revenues and production volumes by USD 409 million.602 Specifically:\n\ni. With respect to revenues, Fair Links \"considers that 99% of the Extraordinary Revenues above the Reference Price would have to be contributed to Ecuador. Instead, based on instructions from Burlington, Compass Lexecon includes all the Extraordinary Revenues in Burlington's revenues for the purposes of calculating its claimed damage\".603\n\nii. With respect to production, disregarding Law 42 allows Burlington to allege that additional wells would have been drilled in Block 7, which in turn impacts crude oil production and related capital expenditures.604\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 586-590. To isolate the impact of Law 42, Fair Links has calculated the Blocks' FMV using all of Compass Lexecon's operation and discount rate assumptions, (a) adding production and related CAPEX figures to new wells that would have been drilled (without the Block 7 extension), and (b) adding to the revenues 99% of the extraordinary revenues that would have been owed to Ecuador pursuant to Law 42.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 42.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 43.\n\n**4.3 Analysis**\n----------------\n\n357.\n\nThe standard of compensation being full reparation, the Tribunal's task is to place Burlington in the position in which it would have been but for the expropriation. The Tribunal has found that the expropriation deprived Burlington of the possibility of exercising its rights under the PSCs and deriving revenues therefrom from 30 August 2009 onwards. The Tribunal must therefore quantify the compensation that will replace the value of the PSCs. It is common ground that this quantification can be effected on the basis of the PSCs' future profit-generating capacity using the DCF method. This exercise requires calculating as accurately as possible the revenues which would have accrued to Burlington under the PSCs from the date of the expropriation until the date of the scheduled expiry of the PSCs in a counterfactual scenario in which the expropriation is deemed not to have occurred. The question here is whether, when assessing the value of the PSCs' revenue stream, the Tribunal should assume that extraordinary revenues are taxed at 99% (as mandated by Law 42) or that Ecuador absorbs the impact of this tax.\n\n358.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, when quantifying the value of the expropriated assets, the Tribunal must proceed on the basis that Burlington is entitled to exercise all of the contractual rights it would have had but for the expropriation, and that Ecuador would have complied with its contractual obligations going forward. In other words, when building the counterfactual scenario in which the expropriation has not occurred, the Tribunal must assume that Burlington holds the rights that made up the expropriated assets and that those rights are respected. This does not mean that the Tribunal is enforcing a contract claim. What the Tribunal does is to value an expropriated asset, which the Parties agree consists of a bundle of rights allowing Burlington to obtain future revenues.\n\n359.\n\nIn this case, the expropriated contracts included a mandatory tax absorption clause which cannot be ignored for valuation purposes. Indeed, in the Decision on Liability, \"for the sole purpose of the resolution of the Treaty claim before it\", the Tribunal found that \"the PSCs provided for the following rights: (i) the right to receive and sell the contractor's share of oil production irrespective of the price of oil and its internal rate of return, subject to the payment of the taxes and employment contributions specified in the PSCs; and (ii) the right to the application of a mechanism that would absorb the effects of any tax increase affecting the economy of the PSCs, i.e. a right to tax absorption under certain conditions\".605\n\nDoL, \u00b6 335.\n\n360.\n\nAfter analyzing the relevant language, purpose and context of the PSC,606 the Tribunal found that Ecuador was under an obligation to apply a correction factor that would wipe out the effects of Law 42.607 This meant in practice that, after having taxed Burlington's extraordinary revenues at 99% (as mandated by Law 42), Burlington's oil production share had to be increased to the point at which the impact of Law 42 was eliminated.608 In other words, Burlington's revenues should be restored to their pre-Law 42 levels. Accordingly, the PSCs gave Burlington the contractual right to generate revenues as if Law 42 did not exist. The Tribunal is aware that the *Perenco* tribunal adopted a different reasoning, but this Tribunal stands by its finding that the impact of new taxes needed to be wiped out.\n\nSee: Article 11.7 of the Block 7 PSC and Article 15.2 of the Block 21 PSC, transcribed at DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 335 and 405, respectively.\n\nSee: DoL, \u00b6 327 (\"[\u2026] the tax modification provision contained in clause 11.12 of the PSC for Block 7 calls for the application of a mandatory correction factor that absorbs any impact of a tax increase or decrease on the economy of the Contract\"), \u00b6 333 (\"[\u2026] the language of [the tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21] calls for the mandatory adjustment of the parties' oil production shares \u2018in order to restore the economics of the contract in place before the tax modification\"), and \u00b6 334 (\"the application of a correction factor is mandatory when a tax affects the economy of the PSCs for Blocks 7 or 21. This correction factor must be of such extent as to wipe out the effects of the tax on the economy of the PSC. Otherwise stated, the correction factor must restore the economy of the PSC to its pre-tax modification level\").\n\nSee: *Id.*, \u00b6 315 (\"[\u2026] the economy of the PSCs was not a function of either a projected oil price of USD 15/bbl or of a contractor's IRR of 15%. Rather, the economy of the PSCs entitled the contractor to receive its oil participation share, dispose of it on the market irrespective of price, and thus to obtain its oil share's market value \u2013 subject to the applicable taxes and to the contract provisions on new taxes\").\n\n361.\n\nAs determined in the Decision on Liability, the \"[t]he tax absorption clauses contained in the PSCs were part and parcel of the value of Burlington's investment\".609 As a result, the value of the expropriated assets going forward includes the right to the application of a correction factor which would wipe out the effects of Law 42.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 405.\n\n362.\n\nIt follows that when calculating the PSCs' future revenue stream, the effects of Law 42 must be ignored. This is not because Law 42 was an internationally wrongful act or an otherwise unlawful value-depressing measure. It is because Ecuador was contractually required to apply a correction factor that would \"wipe out the effects of the tax on the economy of the PSC\",610 and that right is \"part and parcel of the value of Burlington's investment\".611 The fact that Ecuador had breached this contractual obligation in the past612 and threatened to do so in the future cannot diminish Ecuador's liability. As the Iran-US Claims Tribunal observed in *Tippetts*, \"[i]t is a well recognized principle in many municipal systems and in international law that no one should be allowed to reap advantages from their own wrong, *nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria* \".613 In particular, when quantifying the value of a going concern, the Tribunal must disregard the effects of value-depressing measures taken by the State related to the investment.614\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 334.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 405.\n\nSee, for instance: *Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 417-419.\n\n*Tippetts v. Iran,* Award of 22 June 1984, p. 228 (**Exh. CL-264**).\n\nSee, for instance: *American International Group v. Iran,* Award of 19 December 1983, p. 9 (**Exh. CL-257**) (\"In ascertaining the going concern value of an enterprise at a previous point in time for purposes of establishing the appropriate quantum of compensation for nationalization, it is [\u2026] necessary to exclude the effects of actions taken by the nationalizing State in relation to the enterprise which actions may have depressed its value\"). See also: *Phillips Petroleum v. Iran,* Award of 29 June 1989, \u00b6 135 (**Exh. CL-157**), referring to: *American International* (\"[I]t is well established that the Tribunal must exclude from its calculation of compensation any diminution of value resulting from the taking of the Claimant's property or from any prior threats or actions by the Respondents related thereto\").\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal's determination that Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs' tax absorption clauses was not an expropriation does not modify this conclusion. The Tribunal must quantify the value of what was taken, and what was taken were contracts providing among other things for the right to tax absorption. Nor is this inconsistent with the Tribunal's dismissal of Burlington's claim for past Law 42 dues: the tax absorption clauses form part of the asset that was taken, so when building the counterfactual scenario the Tribunal must assume that they apply. By contrast, Burlington's credits against Ecuador for the amounts owed by Ecuador as a result of the application of these clauses *before* the expropriation were not taken by Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks.\n\n364.\n\nThe value of Burlington's investment must thus assume that Burlington can exercise its contractual rights, including the right to tax absorption. Ecuador contends however that \"as a result of the waiver with prejudice, Burlington's alleged contractual right to be insulated against the effects of Law 42 is unenforceable and, hence, valueless\".615 This is allegedly so because a hypothetical willing buyer would be placed in the same position as Burlington, whose Subsidiaries \"have waived the possibility of ever refiling their claims under the Participation Contracts in any form in the future\".616 According to Ecuador, any willing buyer would thus be barred from enforcing the right to be indemnified against the effects of Law 42.617\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 135.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 258:21-259:1 (Opening, Silva Romero), citing: DoL, \u00b6 199.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 136.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree. First, while the Tribunal held that \"the Burlington Subsidiaries have waived the possibility of ever re-filing their claims under the PSCs in any form in the future\", it also considered that \"[t]hey have not waived the underlying rights and Burlington may thus rely on these underlying rights to pursue its Treaty claims in this arbitration\".618 Accordingly, these underlying rights must be considered when valuing Burlington's expropriated investment.\n\nDoL, \u00b6 199.\n\n366.\n\nSecond and more importantly, as the standard of compensation is full reparation, the Tribunal must value what Burlington lost as a result of the expropriation. What Burlington lost was a contract with a full set of rights, each of which must be given its value. While the Parties agree that the Tribunal must search for the FMV of these rights, the Tribunal is not bound by the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" analogy. This analogy is only a tool to calculate the FMV of the expropriated investment, to be used if and when it helps to appropriately quantify the investor's loss. As Burlington argued at the Hearing, as a result of the expropriation, Burlington did not lose an opportunity to sell its contract rights; it lost an opportunity to exercise them.619 The relevant question is thus not whether a hypothetical buyer would have paid full value for the PSCs, it is what value Burlington would have derived from exercising the rights under the PSCs, but for their expropriation.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 98:20-99:1 (Opening, Coriell).\n\n367.\n\nThe *Occidental II* tribunal adopted a similar reasoning. When addressing Ecuador's argument that future cash flows should take into account the effect of Law 42, that tribunal concluded that this argument \"suffer[ed] from a fundamental flaw\" because the relevant test was not what a hypothetical buyer would pay under the current circumstances, but rather what the claimants had lost:\n\n\"It is obvious that a hypothetical third party would not pay more than would be justified by the prospective returns on an investment, and that Law 42 would have to figure in an assessment of these returns (either because of the risk of its continued application or because Ecuador would insist on this as a pre-condition to authorization). But asking what a hypothetical investor would pay under Law 42 which the Tribunal has found to be in breach of the Participation Contract is irrelevant to assessing what OEPC, whose contract protected it against things like Law 42, has actually lost. To reiterate, the test is not \"what would a hypothetical buyer pay in the circumstances as they are now\"; the test is \"what have the Claimants lost.\" The fair market value is a guide to answering this question, but what must be calculated is the discounted cash flow value of the Participation Contract (i.e. Block 15) excluding breaches of it (i.e. Law 42) by the Respondent\".620\n\n*Occidental v. Ecuador II,* Award of 5 October 2012, \u00b6 539 (**Exh. CL-240**). The Tribunal notes that this part of the Occidental tribunal's reasoning was not affected by the partial annulment (See: *Occidental v. Ecuador*, Decision on Annulment of 2 November 2015, \u00b6 590(1) and (2)).\n\n368.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Burlington's lost profits claim must be valued assuming compliance by Ecuador with its contractual obligations under the PSCs, in particular its tax absorption obligations. As the Tribunal discusses further below, this means that the effect of Law 42 must be ignored when calculating the production values that give rise to the projected cash flows on the basis of which Burlington's damages are quantified.\n\n**5. Computation of cash flows**\n--------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nHaving determined that the proper valuation methodology is the DCF method, the Tribunal must now compute Burlington's lost cash flows. To this effect, it will first refer to the Updated Model (Section 5.1). It will then examine the variables and assumptions proposed by the Parties to compute those lost cash flows (Section 5.2). Thereafter, it will address the distinction between past and future cash flows, including the relevant actualization or discount rate applicable to each (Section 5.3). It will then address the sequence of the DCF analysis (Section 5.4) and end with the computation of the lost cash flows, for which it has relied on the Updated Model (Section 5.5).\n\n**5.1 The Updated Model**\n-------------------------\n\n370.\n\nTo compute Burlington's lost (past and future) cash flows, the Tribunal has relied on the Joint Valuation Model (the \"Model\") provided by the Parties' damages experts. The Model was prepared jointly by Compass Lexecon and Fair Links pursuant to the Tribunal's invitation and specifications in PO29.621 Specifically, the Tribunal requested the experts jointly to prepare a valuation model allowing it to choose between the different variables proposed by the Parties for the computation of cash flows as specified by the Tribunal. The experts submitted a first version of the Model, together with an explanatory memorandum, on 24 April 2015. On the Tribunal's invitation,622 the experts updated the Model on 20 September 2016 (the \"Updated Model\"), again with a joint explanatory memorandum (the \"Joint Memorandum\"). The Parties provided their comments to the Updated Model on 4 October 2016.\n\nPO29 of 13 March 2015.\n\nTribunal's letter of 27 July 2016.\n\n371.\n\nBurlington essentially agrees with the Updated Model.623 Ecuador, by contrast, has expressed certain reservations as to the accuracy and reliability of the model. It emphasizes that it fundamentally disagrees with some of the technical and legal assumptions upon which the model is based. It is also concerned about the *caveats* set out by the experts in their Joint Memorandum. Accordingly, \"[g]iven the numerous limitations inherent in the Updated Model, Ecuador urges the Tribunal to exercise the utmost caution in the reliance it may place on said Model for quantum purposes\".624\n\nBurlington's letter of 4 October 2016.\n\nEcuador's letter of 4 October 2016, pp. 1-2.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador's suggestion that the Updated Model is flawed because it contains legal and technical assumptions with which Ecuador disagrees. By definition, a joint valuation model must contain each side's legal and technical assumptions, regardless of their merit. It is then for the Tribunal to choose the ones which it considers well-founded to carry out its computation.\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the experts jointly stated that they \"agree with the functionalities, computations and calculations of the Joint Model based on the options that were put to us by the Tribunal, where feasible (not all the Tribunal's requests could be implemented)\".625 That said, the Tribunal has reviewed the *caveats* raised by the experts in their Joint Memorandum (most of which refer to functionalities that could not be implemented and thus require approximations)626 and Ecuador's specific objections. Given the Tribunal's choices below, some of these *caveats* become moot, and the Tribunal addresses those that are still relevant in the context of its discussion of the pertinent variable.\n\nJoint Memorandum by Compass Lexecon and Fair Links, \"Overview of the Updated Joint Valuation model Produced in Response to the July 2016 Letter\", \u00b6 3.\n\nSee, for instance: *Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.\n\n**5.2 Variables and assumptions for cash flows**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal will start with the production profile (Section 5.2.1), followed by crude oil prices (Section 5.2.2), operating expenditures (Section 5.2.3), capital expenditures (Section 5.2.4), and taxation (5.2.5).\n\n**5.2.1 Production profile**\n----------------------------\n\n**a. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n375.\n\nCompass Lexecon values Burlington's investment \"in a hypothetical scenario where Ecuador complied with its legal obligations regarding the tax absorption\".627 It explains that \"[i]n such a scenario, [Burlington] would have had economic incentive to invest in new drilling, which, according to [Burlington], and as described by Mr. Crick, would have resulted in additional production from new wells beginning in December 2007 for Block 7, and January 2008 for Block 21. Consequently, [Burlington's] investment and production profile would have differed from what has been actually observed in both Block 7 and Block 21 from 2007 onwards\".628\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 14.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n376.\n\nAccording to Burlington, it would be improper to rely on a production profile based on actual investment on the date of the expropriation, as actual production was diminished by Ecuador's unlawful value-depressing measures. Messrs. Martinez and Crick confirmed that Ecuador's failure to absorb the 50% tax affected the incentive to further invest.629 With the 99% tax, \"the viability of any further investment was wiped out\", and by the end of 2007, all investment ceased.630 Accordingly, actual production was \"far lower\" than in the but-for scenario. Had Ecuador absorbed the tax, the Consortium would have had \"the economic incentive to continue\" investing.631\n\nMem., \u00b6 83, referring to: Martinez WS1 Supp., \u00b6\u00b6 15-18; Martinez WS4 Supp., \u00b6\u00b6 5-8; Crick WS, \u00b6\u00b6 5-10, 22-24, 103.\n\nMem., \u00b6 83, referring to: Five-Year Plans (**Exh.

Mr. Crick also forecasts an alternative scenario that assumes that the Block 7 contract would have been extended to August 2018, which is relied on by Compass Lexecon for its valuation of the Block 7 extension and is irrelevant here.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n379.\n\nMr. Crick calculated the lost production volumes on the basis of the number of wells in existence at the time of dispossession, as well as the incremental wells that would have been drilled \"but for\" the taking.637 He then applied a \"production/decline rate\" to both sets of wells to determine the number of barrels of oil that the wells would produce.638 More specifically:\n\ni. With respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick's production analysis relied on actual oil production data drawn both from Perenco records and the records produced by Ecuador.639 Where appropriate, Mr. Crick extended the wells' production values into the future using standard engineering techniques.640\n\nii. With respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick explains that the Consortium's program of additional investment reflects what a reasonable and prudent investor would have invested unconstrained by Ecuador's breaches.641 After determining the number of incremental wells that the Consortium would have drilled in each Block, Mr. Crick applied \"a reasonable drilling schedule for that Block that takes into account Perenco's historical practices, its financial capabilities, and the equipment that would have been available to it\".642 He then forecasted production for the new wells using data ranging from seismic information to actual production data from the existing wells. Mr. Crick adopted different approaches for his calculations depending on the field characteristics (for instance, for Oso, the actual production and decline rates; and for Lobo and CPUF, water injection simulations).643\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nMem., \u00b6 157.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nMem., \u00b6 87, referring to: Crick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9-10; as well as Martinez WS4 Supp., \u00b6 7.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6 6.\n\nMem., \u00b6 168.\n\n380.\n\nMr. Crick concludes that, but for the expropriation and ignoring the effects of Law 42, the Consortium would have produced **17.7 million barrels of oil** from Block 7 from December 2007 to August 2010 (the scheduled expiry of the Block 7 PSC), as follows:644\n\ni. The production from existing wells (68 at the time of the expropriation)645 between December 2007 and August 2010 would have been 4.3 million barrels of oil.646 This was the actual volume produced by Petroamazonas from existing wells in that period and Mr. Crick assumes that Perenco would have produced the same amount.647\n\nii. With respect to production from incremental wells, Mr. Crick explains that \"[i]f Perenco had not been granted an extension it would have continued the programme of drilling on Oso, by far the largest and most important project on Block 7\", at a rate of one well per month, but would have stopped any new investments one year before the end of the contract.648 Mr. Crick thus calculates that 21 additional wells would have been drilled in Block 7, specifically in the Oso field, from December 2007 until August 2009, resulting in 13.4 million barrels for the 21 new wells.649 To calculate production from these new wells, Mr. Crick used a correlation for the initial rate and then a decline curve based on a type curve derived from the existing wells.650\n\nMr. Crick also provides a forecast for Block 7 in an extension scenario. However, as the Tribunal has rejected this head of claim it will disregard this forecast for reasons of procedural efficiency.\n\nAccording to: Compass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 40.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 139-142 and Figure 1.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 139, 142.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 140.\n\nMem., \u00b6 164; Reply, \u00b6 182; Crick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 140, 165-172, as revised by Crick WS3, Appendix A. Mr. Crick also opined that the Consortium would have drilled an additional 70 wells had the Block 7 PSC been extended until 2018, yielding a further 105.8 million barrels (for a total forecast of 125.7 million) (Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 134, 182; Crick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 145-148, as revised by Crick WS3, Appendix A).

Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 387:8-17 (Direct, Crick); Direct Presentation, Slide 26.\n\n381.\n\nAccording to Mr. Crick, this timeline and forecast are reasonable, which is confirmed by Petroamazonas' actual drilling and production since the expropriation.651 Mr. Crick notes in particular that the 2013 Ryder Scott Reserves Report652 \"demonstrates that Petroamazonas is planning to drill far more wells at Oso than were contemplated in the 2008 Perenco development plan, and projects total recoverable oil volumes higher than what [Mr. Crick] predicted in the 2018 extension case\".653 By June 2013, Petroamazonas had drilled 88 wells in the Oso field (the first 21 in just 18 months),654 and had stated that it would drill 110 more.655 In addition, Petroamazonas' Year-End Report for 2013 indicates that there are 761 million barrels of oil in place, which is over four times Perenco's estimate in 2008 (175 million barrels).656 Mr. Crick concludes that \"Block 7's Oso field was a very good field that just kept getting better, and it would have been drilled aggressively, just as Petroamazonas is doing now\".657\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 139-144.\n\nReport dated 20 October 2013 prepared by the oil and gas consultancy Ryder Scott Company at Petroamazonas's request on the proved, probable, and possible reserves in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 30 June 2013 (**Annex D to Crick WS2** and **Exh.

With respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick forecasts the production of the 33 wells in place in the Yuralpa field on the date of the expropriation658 on the basis of their historical production until August 2009, as well as Petroamazonas' actual production data.659 Mr. Crick initially prepared his forecast on the basis of type-curve analysis.660 According to Mr. Crick, the actual performance of the wells drilled by Perenco shows an initial 43% well production decline that stabilized at 9%, which is confirmed by the actual performance of the wells drilled by Petroamazonas.661 On that basis, Mr. Crick calculated that total recovery from existing wells in Block 21 until June 2021 would be 25.7 million barrels.662\n\nii. With respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick starts by explaining that \"[b]y the end of March 2013 the Main Hollin in Yuralpa had produced 35.2 million barrels, only 10% of the original oil in place\" which \"confirms the low volumetric sweep efficiency of the present wells and implies that many more new wells are needed to properly drain the reservoir\".663 After discounting the fringe of the reservoir (which Perenco did not expect to develop due to its low oil thickness), \"the volume of oil originally considered developable is reduced to 246 million barrels\".664 This means that \"the wells in the Yuralpa Main Hollin have produced 14.3% of the developable oil\", which is low, showing that \"there is still a tremendous amount of undrained oil in place\".665 Mr. Crick forecasts that the Consortium would have drilled a further 24 wells until 2021 but for Ecuador's unlawful conduct, 21 of which would have consisted of \"in fill\" drilling (i.e., drilling that \"filled in\" the areas of unrecovered oil between existing wells) in the center of the reservoir (the 1900 acre area with an oil column greater than 90 feet), and 3 additional wells outside that area.666 Mr. Crick assumes a drilling rate of one well per month (which is consistent with Perenco's historical drilling rate),667 starting in January 2008668 and ending in December 2009.669 Again relying initially on type-curve analysis, and using the empirical data on average initial production and decline rates,670 Mr. Crick projects that the Consortium would have recovered an additional 12.2 million barrels from these 24 wells671 (which, added to the 25.7 million barrels from existing wells, results in a total production forecast of 37.9 million barrels).672\n\nMr. Crick explains that the Yuralpa field is the only producing field in Block 21 (Crick WS1, \u00b6 32). He further explains that by the time Perenco ceased drilling there were 32 wells able to produce and 31 wells actually producing. Crick WS \u00b6 98; see also: Figures 9 and 11, Crick WS1, pages 26, 28 and Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 370:5-6 (Direct, Crick), in relation to Slide 9 of Mr. Crick's Direct Presentation. See also: Yuralpa Simulation Study, Annex E to Crick WS1, p. 2. That being said, the table included at paragraph 190 of Mr. Crick's Second Witness Statement refers to 33 existing wells.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 66-92.\n\nCrick WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 11-36. Dr. Strickland explains that type curve analysis \"plots the oil rate against time for multiple wells on the same plot. The time reflected on the x-axis is usually displayed as months since the date of first production rather than time as a calendar date. Thus, in this type of plot, all wells start at the same time (0) regardless of the calendar date on which each well was drilled. At each point in time, the average rate of all wells combined is calculated. Mr. Crick used this average to develop his rates of decline for future well production\" (Strickland ER, \u00b6 46).\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 66-92.\n\nSee: Table in Mem., \u00b6 162.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6 93.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 95.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nMem., \u00b6 165, Reply, \u00b6 134; Crick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 98-101.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 102-107.\n\nMr. Crick explains that Perenco stopped drilling in Yuralpa on 10 February 2007 mainly because of the uncertainty and economic penalty created by Law 42, but he does not assume continuous drilling on Block 21. Rather, because Perenco was already conducting a field study to better understand the nature of the reservoir, Mr. Crick assumes that Perenco would have stopped drilling in February 2007, waited for the results of the study, and recommenced drilling on 1 January 2008. *Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.\n\nMr. Crick explains that the 24 new wells would have taken two years to drill, and while \"[a]dditional wells may well have been profitable beyond these, [\u2026] it is difficult to predict how much oil would remain for such wells once the appropriate pump upgrades and water shut-offs had been implemented\". As a result, he assumed no drilling in the Yuralpa field after December 2009. *Id.*, \u00b6 107.\n\nAs summarized by Dr. Strickland, Mr. Crick's recovery forecast for future wells \"was based on (1) the initial oil rate (known for existing wells, and projected for new wells); and (2) the average production decline rate\" (Strickland ER, \u00b6 45).\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 108-118, 136.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 137.\n\n383.\n\nMr. Crick used four different methods to forecast oil production in the Yuralpa field: (i) type-curve analysis; (ii) individual decline-curve analysis of existing wells (his initial methodology); (iii) the Yuralpa full-field simulation model made in 2007, and (iv) the same model, updated with data to July 2009 and modified to match performance per date.673 The results of these four methods essentially concur.674 Mr. Crick explains that type-curve analysis is more reliable than well-by-well analysis because, as a result of the poor behavior of some wells, reviewing their history on an individual basis is not a good predictor of the future. By contrast, type-curve analysis looks for constants in well behavior, which allows for better prediction. In particular, it clearly shows a 9% decline rate after 36 to 40 months, whether one looks at the performance between 2003 and 2004 or between 2006 and 2007.675\n\nTr.

Given that Petroamazonas had already drilled eight new wells after taking over operations from Perenco (together with three re-drills), this makes a total of 36 additional wells proposed or drilled by Petroamazonas in Yuralpa field after July 2009, compared to the 24 new wells proposed in my prior witness statement\").\n\n385.\n\nIt arises from the foregoing that Burlington's total \"but for\" production forecast (i.e., freed from the effects of Law 42) is as follows:682\n\ni.

RPS: \"But For\" Oil Production to Contract Expiry** |\n|  | **Block 21** (to August 2021) | **Block 7** (to August 2010) | **Block 7** (to August 2018) |\n| **Mr.** **Crick** | **37.6 million barrels** | **17.4 million barrels** | **125.4 million barrels** |\n| **RPS** | **11.24 million barrels** | **3.61 million barrels** | **no forecast** |\n\nBurlington's Opening Presentation, Slide 77; Tr. Quantum (Day 1) (ENG), 114:19-115:8 (Opening, Miles).\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal thus understands that Burlington has amended its forecasted production volumes, or at least limits its submissions as regards those volumes, to a total of 37.6 million barrels for Block 21 and 17.4 million barrels for Block 7 (in a no extension scenario).\n\n389.\n\nBurlington argues that Mr. Crick\u2019s forecast is reasonable, technically sound, and accurate, as it has been confirmed by Ecuador\u2019s own data.\n\n390.\n\nBurlington first contends that Mr. Crick\u2019s drilling forecasts are reasonable. This is because (i) the Blocks\u2019 performance under Petroamazonas confirms that the only reason that Burlington stopped drilling was Ecuador\u2019s failure to absorb the impact of Law 42; (ii) the evidence otherwise shows that the Consortium would have drilled more wells but for Ecuador\u2019s unlawful conduct, and (iii) the new wells forecasted by Mr. Crick would have been profitable. Specifically:\n\ni. With respect to (i), Burlington observes that Petroamazonas, which is not subject to Law 42, has undertaken a successful drilling and production program that is very similar to the one forecasted by Mr. Crick for a scenario in which Ecuador honors its obligation to absorb the economic impact of Law 42.687 This proves that, had Ecuador honored its tax absorption obligations, the Consortium would have continued drilling. Indeed, Ecuador\u2019s failure to absorb the impact of Law 42 was the only reason why the Consortium stopped drilling. Contrary to Ecuador's contentions, the 9 October 2007 email from Jim Johnson,688 then Partnership Operations Manager at Burlington, does not prove that the Consortium believed that all drilling on Blocks 7 and 21 would still be economic under Law 42 at 99%; that email clearly refers only to the drilling of four wells in the Oso field in Block 7, which was still considered economic because the Consortium had already paid to drill these wells (making them sunk costs), and Block 7 benefitted from a higher reference price.689 If anything, that email shows that the Consortium was hesitant to continue drilling, as Mr. Johnson recommended that Burlington drill only the next programmed well on Oso, \"and then watch the situation and make decisions on the remaining wells based on what happens in the country\".690\n\nii. With respect to (ii), Ecuador's claim that, even absent Law 42, the Consortium would in any event not have continued drilling in the Blocks is incorrect. Burlington's witnesses confirm that, had Ecuador not breached the PSCs, the Consortium would have continued drilling.691 While Mr. Crick's drilling projections reflect Perenco's proposed investment plan, Mr. Martinez confirmed that Burlington would have supported this investment plan had Ecuador honored its obligations under the PSCs.692 More specifically:\n\na. Mr. Crick confirmed that the Consortium planned to continue developing Block 21 despite the fact that the wells drilled in the first few years of operation had produced less than expected.693 Instead of abandoning the field, Mr. Crick explains that the Consortium stopped drilling in 2006 and undertook a major study to better understand the reservoir's behavior.694 Ecuador's claim that the Consortium stopped drilling in Block 21 because it believed that it was fully developed is incorrect. The documents on which Ecuador relies (specifically, the January 2007 Yuralpa Mapping Update,695 the May 2007 Latin American Reserves Review,696 the ConocoPhillips 2007 Sales Memorandum,697 the September 2007 Budget Committee Meeting Presentation,698 and the Yuralpa Field Upper and Main Hollin Reservoir Evaluation)699 are not useful for measuring damages in the proper \"but for\" scenario, because they reflect the impact of Law 42 on the Consortium's business plans.700 In any event, Ecuador and RPS take these documents out of context: properly interpreted, these documents prove that only Law 42 caused the Consortium to stop drilling.701 Finally, Mr. Crick asserts that there is no evidence of an open or extensive natural fracture network in the Yuralpa field; to the contrary, the evidence suggests that no such fracturing exists or that the permeability of existing fractures is such that their behavior is the same as that of the reservoir rock.702 In Mr. Crick's opinion, the cause for the water breakthrough in the Yuralpa wells is water coning, which means that the oil between the water cones may be extracted through in-fill drilling, providing additional reserves.703\n\nb. Ecuador's claim that the Consortium stopped drilling on Block 7 due to concerns about reservoir quality is equally unfounded. The documents on which Ecuador relies (specifically, the May 2007 Latin American Reserves Review,704 the 2007 ConocoPhillips Sales Memorandum,705 and the 9 October 2007 email from Mr. Johnson)706 actually prove that the Consortium planned to continue drilling on Block 7 but for the effects of Law 42.707\n\niii. With respect to (iii), Compass Lexecon has run a profitability test708 on Mr. Crick's production forecasts from late 2007 onwards and concludes that, but for Ecuador's failure to absorb the impact of Law 42, Mr. Crick's 24 proposed new wells on Block 21 would have yielded USD 134 million in profits, while the 21 new wells for Block 7 (in the non-extension case) would have yielded USD 294 million.709\n\nReply, \u00b6 142.\n\n**Exh.

Using different forecasting techniques, Dr. Strickland reaches very similar conclusions about the future performance of the Blocks, proving that Mr. Crick's forecasting methods and conclusions are accurate and reliable.710 Specifically with respect to Block 21, Dr. Strickland confirmed that (a) the conditions for drilling on the Main Hollin are good (the reservoir is fed by strong underground aquifer providing enough pressure to extract oil, and the soil has a sufficient porosity to allow oil flow), (b) the wells still perform economically in case of water coning, (c) the best way to extract further oil was through in-fill drilling (decreasing space between wells from 70 to 40 acres),711 (d) contrary to RPS' claim, the Main Hollin reservoir is *not* fractured,712 and (e) the use of \"type curves\" of existing wells by Mr. Crick to determine future production is more appropriate than the well-by-well analysis employed by RPS.713 Finally, Dr. Strickland also confirmed Mr. Crick's production forecasts for new wells in Block 21.714\n\nReply, \u00b6 140.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 173-174, referring to: Strickland ER, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 28, 35.\n\nReply, \u00b6 175, referring to: Strickland ER, \u00b6\u00b6 100-112.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 177.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\n392.\n\nMore importantly, in addition to being reasonable and technically sound, Burlington submits that Mr. Crick's forecast is accurate, as it has been confirmed by Petroamazonas' actual production data and Ryder Scott's report providing reserves projections which had been commissioned by Petroamazonas.715 The Ryder Scott Reserves Report indeed shows that the ultimate recovery possible from the Blocks is in line with Mr. Crick's estimate: in June 2013, Ryder Scott calculated that the total proven and probable reserves of oil that could be recovered from Block 21 was 60 million barrels, while Mr. Crick's estimate was only marginally higher at 63 million barrels.716 Similarly, Ryder Scott's calculation of total proven and probable reserves for Block 7 (230 million barrels) is higher than Mr. Crick's estimate (205 million barrels).717 This is reflected in Slide 101 of Burlington's Closing Presentation at the Hearing:\n\nPetroamazonas Productivity Data Matches Crick\u2019s Projections\n\nSee: paragraphs 381 and 384 above.\n\nReply, \u00b6 137, Compass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 9. The Tribunal notes that during the Hearing Mr. Crick estimated the expected ultimate recovery (EUR) from the Yuralpa field at 64.2 million barrels (Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 361:9-10 (Direct, Crick) and Slide 22 of his Direct Presentation). Similarly, Slide 101 of Burlington's Closing Presentation shows it at 64.22 million barrels.\n\nReply, \u00b6 137, Compass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 9. The Tribunal notes that during the Hearing Burlington stated that the EUR for Block 7 was 220.68 million barrels (Slide 101 of Burlington's Closing Presentation).\n\n393.\n\nBy contrast, Burlington argues that RPS's predictions must be rejected, for the following reasons:\n\ni. RPS's forecast is fundamentally flawed because it relies on the incorrect assumption that the Consortium would have been subject to the full effects of Law 42. This assumption invalidates RPS's entire forecast as it is premised on a reduced investment and drilling program that does not correspond to the applicable \"but for\" scenario.718 In particular, RPS wrongly assumes no new wells in Block 7 due to the effects of Law 42.719\n\nii. RPS's opinion that, by August 2009, Block 21 was \"fully developed\" and that additional wells would have only accelerated production of existing reserves is wrong.720 Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland, through the use of different forecasting techniques, confirm that the Main Hollin reservoir still had large quantities of oil.721 Mr. Crick gives four reasons why RPS's conclusion in this respect is wrong: (a) the wells drilled by Petroamazonas in 2011-2012 have produced new reserves722 (the Tribunal understands this to mean that the wells have allowed Petroamazonas to discover reserves previously unknown): (b) RPS's recovery factor for Yuralpa is unreasonably low (10.5%, when the minimum considered in the Beliveau study is 15%), and is based on a flawed calculation of initial oil in place;723 (c) RPS's opinion is founded on a \"misguided interpretation of the 2007 study and model of the Yuralpa field\",724 and (d) as noted at (iii) below, the Ryder Scott Reserves Report shows reserves that are much higher than those used by RPS and more new wells than those proposed by Mr. Crick.725 This is confirmed by the fact that Mr. Daigre of RPS conceded at the Hearing that Block 21 was in fact not fully developed in August 2009.726\n\niii. More importantly, RPS's projections have been proven wrong by Petroamazonas' actual figures. Mr. Crick explains that \"[a]s of 2014, Petroamazonas has already produced more oil from Block 21 than RPS's forecasts say the Block was capable of producing through 2021\", which means that Petroamazonas is currently producing reserves that RPS believed do not exist.727 Indeed, by July 2014, the wells on Block 21 had produced more than 41 million barrels of oil and were still producing new reserves.728 This proves that RPS's production forecast of 11.24 million barrels by the end of the Block 21 PSC and of an ultimate recovery of 39 million barrels was obviously incorrect.729 At the Hearing, RPS conceded that actual data had proven its forecast to be incorrect.730 Although RPS persists in stating that the drilling program was a failure since \"the wells only accelerated production from existing wells\",731 the evidence in fact shows that reserves have increased year after year for the past three years, despite continuous production,732 a fact that Mr. Daigre also conceded.733\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 136-137, 162-163, 184.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 184, referring to: RPS ER3, \u00b6 216.\n\nReply, \u00b6 166, referring to: RPS ER3, \u00b6 217.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 169-171 (Mr. Crick) and 172-174 (Dr. Strickland).\n\nCrick WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 149-156.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 157-166.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 148, 167-187.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 188-189.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 125-127.\n\nCrick WS2, \u00b6 10.\n\nReply, \u00b6 165, referring to: Crick WS2, \u00b6 150.\n\nReply, \u00b6 165.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 123-125, referring to: Tr.

Quantum (Day 4) (ENG), Day 4, 1067:1-15 (Cross, Daigre).\n\n394.\n\nThe differences between RPS's ultimate recovery projections for Block 21 and those of Mr. Crick, Dr. Strickland, Ryder Scott and Petroamazonas are illustrated in the following graph:734\n\n**Block 21 Estimated Ultimate Recovery, EUR (MMStb)**\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 119, referring to: Dr. Strickland's Direct Presentation, Slide 8, also at Slide 29 of Burlington's Closing Presentation.\n\n395.\n\nWith respect to Block 7, Burlington points out that Mr. Crick's forecast was even more conservative than the one prepared by Ryder Scott for Petroamazonas, as is clear from the following chart:735\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 121, referring to: Burlington's Closing Presentation, Slide 44.\n\n396.\n\nFinally, Burlington argues that Ecuador's excuses for RPS's failed forecast should be disregarded. Ecuador cannot blame the inaccuracy of RPS's forecast on the fact that it used pre-expropriation data, because Mr. Crick checked his Block 21 forecast against three alternative methods that were based solely on pre-expropriation data, and concluded that they confirmed his original forecast.736 Nor can RPS argue that Petroamazonas is not an appropriate proxy for the Consortium: like the Consortium, Petroamazonas is a prudent operator which operates the Blocks with a profitmaximizing motive.737 Further, while it is true that Petroamazonas would have obtained 100% of the proceeds of the fields and the Consortium only 70-80%, Compass Lexecon confirmed (on the basis of profitability tests) that \"the net crude oil prices that the Consortium would have received in the \u2018but for' scenario were high enough for the Consortium to have drilled and produced at least at the same level as Petroamazonas\".738 The evidence also suggests that the Consortium would have pursued a drilling strategy similar to the one of Petroamazonas. For instance, it would have also developed the fringe area of the field, and given the duration remaining on the Block 21 PSC, it would have had the time to refine its drilling strategy.739\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 130, referring to: Crick WS2, \u00b6 6 and Tr.

Ecuador's position**\n-------------------------\n\n398.\n\nEcuador strongly objects to Compass Lexecon's valuation of production volumes. According to Ecuador, Compass Lexecon's calculation of these production volumes is flawed for three main reasons:\n\ni. Compass Lexecon's valuation relies on the production forecasts estimated by Mr. Crick, which Ecuador characterizes as \"unrealistic, technically flawed, and accelerated\".740\n\nii. Ecuador alleges that \"in a DCF valuation as performed by Compass Lexecon, the earlier years of the model are the most valuable ones (because less impacted by the discount rate), which gives an incentive to Burlington and Perenco to accelerate production as much as possible in the earlier years to increase the net present value of the Block 7\".741 This is compounded by the fact that Compass Lexecon is applying an exaggerated actualization rate of 12.1% to bring past cash flows to the valuation date, which gives Burlington and Perenco a further incentive to boost production in 2007 and 2008.742\n\niii. Compass Lexecon artificially inflates the significance of production volumes by applying value drivers in the calculation of FMV in an incorrect order (i.e., applying Law 42 and the actualization rate at the outset, instead of at the end).743 The Tribunal addresses this argument of Ecuador in Section VII.D.5.2.6 below.\n\nCM, \u00b6 428.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 427.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 685, referring to: Fair Links ER3, \u00b6 51.\n\n399.\n\nBy contrast, Fair Links applies the proper DCF methodology and production profile. Fair Links modelled three different production scenarios \"in order to reflect a full understanding of the level of production a willing buyer would have expected\"744 for Blocks 7 and 21, specifically (i) a base case building on RPS's production profile, (ii) a low case (20% lower than RPS), and (iii) and a high case (20% and 15% higher than RPS in Blocks 21 and 7 respectively).745\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6 87.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 87-89.\n\n400.\n\nFor its base case, Fair Links relied on RPS's forecast, according to which the Consortium would have produced the following volumes but for the expropriation:\n\ni. With respect to Block 7, RPS forecasts that the Consortium would have produced 3.61 million barrels of oil from Block 7 from August 30, 2009 until the PSC's scheduled termination on 16 August 2010.746 RPS's forecast is based on the historical production performance of the wells through August 2009, which is consistent with what a willing buyer would have done. RPS also considers that the Block 7 PSC would not have been renewed747 and, given the proximity of the expiry date (one year from the date of the expropriation), no new drilling would have been performed.748\n\nii. With respect to Block 21, RPS assessed that the Consortium would have produced 11.24 million barrels of oil after 30 August 2009 until the termination of the Block 21 PSC (8 June 2021).749 RPS reaches this figure by projecting the Block's historical performance into the future, assuming no new drilling. This is because in RPS's opinion the Yuralpa field was fully developed by February 2007 and \"[f]urther drilling would have resulted in accelerated recovery of the remaining reserves, but no new reserves would have been added\".750\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 429-430, referring to: RPS ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 27 and 191.\n\nBecause Ecuador objects to Burlington's extension scenario for Block 7, it instructed RPS not to draw a production profile for that scenario. Rejoinder, \u00b6 689.\n\nCM, \u00b6 431, referring to: RPS ER3, \u00b6 125.\n\nCM, \u00b6 448; RPS ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 27 and 191.\n\nRPS ER3, \u00b6 217.\n\n401.\n\nRPS's production and reserves estimates are summarized in the following table:751\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Remaining Reserves by Field and Block (barrels) As of 31 August 2009** **Adjusted for Uncertainty (\"Risked\")** |\n| **Field** | **1P** | **2P** |\n| Coca-Payamino | 1,279,346 | 1,321,148 |\n| Oso | 1,721,886 | 1,782,168 |\n| Mono | 178,369 | 182,692 |\n| Gacela | 205,701 | 209,312 |\n| Lobo | 212,738 | 259,054 |\n| Jaguar | - | - |\n| **Total Block 7** | 3,598,040 | 3,754,374 |\n|  |\n| **Block 21 (Yuralpa)** | 10,375,685 11,239,730 |\n|  |\n| **Total Block 7 & 21** | 13,973,724 | 14,994,103 |\n\nRPS ER4, \u00b6 112.\n\n402.\n\nIn Ecuador's view, RPS used the correct methodology and assumptions to calculate its production profiles:\n\ni. Instructed to adopt the view of a willing buyer on the date of the expropriation and to consider the effects of Law 42, RPS \"disregarded events after 30 August 2009 that could not have been anticipated by a willing buyer/seller at the time\".752\n\nii. RPS conducted a well-by-well analysis, in which it analyzed the performance of every well and prepared 1P and 2P forecasts for all of the wells that were producing as of August 2009. Contrary to Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland, \"RPS did not create any new \u2018evidence' to support its analyses and conclusions, such as the \u2018simple' simulation models the Burlington witnesses have created to show \u2018evidence' of water coning. RPS merely reviewed the production data and the related documents and presentations prepared by the Consortium, including 3rd party engineering studies commissioned by it, in the full context of the time in question, 2006-2009\".753\n\niii. RPS used a 25% decline curve, which would have been conservative even using post-expropriation data.754\n\niv. RPS applied a Reserves Adjustment Factor (\"RAF\") to account for the different uncertainty levels of proven and probable reserves, as well as whether those reserves are developed or undeveloped.755 Mr. Crick's failure to apply a RAF to developed reserves is misconceived because, as RPS explains, \"willing buyers of oil and gas assets recognize that there is uncertainty in reserves estimates. As a result, prospective buyers apply adjustments based on several factors including, but not limited to, reserve classifications of Proved, Probable and Possible and whether or not the reserves are Developed or Undeveloped\".756\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 690.\n\nRPS ER4, \u00b6 10.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 698, referring to: RPS ER4, \u00b6 151.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 700, referring to: RPS ER3, \u00b6 229 and RPS ER4, \u00b6 363.\n\nRPS ER4, \u00b6 359.\n\n403.\n\nBy contrast, Ecuador opposes Mr. Crick's production forecast. Ecuador and RPS advance the following general criticisms of those forecasts:\n\ni. The proper valuation date from the perspective of a willing buyer is the date of Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks, 30 August 2009. This means that the only new wells that could be considered for valuation purposes are those that would have been drilled from that date onwards. As a result, any predicted drilling that predates 30 August 2009 should be discarded outright.757\n\nii. To support his incremental drilling forecast starting from December 2007, Mr. Crick wrongly assumes that Law 42 has no impact. Law 42 should not be disregarded and, as Burlington has forever waived its contractual right to be indemnified against the effects of Law 42, this right is valueless. As a result, \"it is wrong to assume as Mr. Crick does that additional investment would have been made from the proceeds of indemnification for the effects of Law 42\".758\n\niii. Mr. Crick wrongly relies on post-expropriation data, including Petroamazonas' actual production data and Ryder Scott's 2011 and 2013 reserves certification reports. This information would neither have been available nor foreseeable to a willing buyer at the time of the expropriation.759 In any event, as explained further below, Petroamazonas is not the correct proxy for the Consortium.\n\niv. Finally, Burlington has failed to prove that the Consortium stopped drilling only because of the impact of Law 42. As explained in more detail below, Burlington has failed to establish with certainty which incremental wells would have been drilled \"but for Law 42 at 99%\" (which was the test enunciated in Burlington's Memorial on Quantum),760 as opposed to those which it would have drilled but for Law 42 at 50%.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 284.\n\nCM, \u00b6 436.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 705.\n\nR-PHB, 287-288, referring to: Mem., p. 44, note 127.\n\n404.\n\nMore specifically, Ecuador and RPS criticize Mr. Crick's production forecast for Block 7 (in the non-extension scenario)761 for the following reasons:\n\ni. Mr. Crick assumes that the Consortium stopped drilling because of the impact of Law 42. This is false: the 9 October 2007 email from Mr. Johnson shows that Burlington considered that drilling in the Oso field would have been profitable even with Law 42 at 99%. Burlington's argument that the Consortium faced a great deal of uncertainty at the time does not change this conclusion.762\n\nii. Mr. Crick's drilling schedule for the 21 incremental wells is \"overly aggressive (thereby artificially increasing production in the earlier years) and not corroborated by the Consortium's contemporaneous documents\".763 Relying on the 2006 Oso Development Plan764 (which was approved in March 2007) and on the 2007 ConocoPhillips Sales Memorandum,765 Ecuador argues that the Consortium planned to drill a maximum of 8 new wells (plus 8 contingent wells, subject to agreement with Ecuador) before the expiry of the Block 7 PSC.766 This limited drilling plan was due to two factors: (a) the reservoirs in Block 7 are difficult to characterize and, as a result, the performance of the wells in the Oso field is more uncertain than Mr. Crick implies,767 and (b) the proximity of the expiry date for the Block 7 PSC.768\n\niii. Mr. Crick's oil recovery forecasts are \"overly optimistic and not technically sound\",769 both for existing and incremental wells:\n\na. With respect to existing wells, Ecuador objects to Mr. Crick's use of Petroamazonas' figures. As explained further below, Petroamazonas is not an appropriate proxy for what the Consortium would have done on Block 7. In addition, the favorable actual crude prices used by Compass Lexecon could not have been anticipated by a willing buyer in August 2009.770\n\nb. With respect to incremental wells, Ecuador argues that Mr. Crick's forecasts are partly based on \"average well curves\" using a flawed methodology. Mr. Crick obtained these average well curves by dividing the total monthly production by the number of wells producing each month, which results in a higher average, and selectively included only the wells that would result in higher production. The use of this methodology is also problematic as total fluid production rates change throughout the life of each well.771\n\nc. Mr. Crick did not apply a RAF to his projections, which is necessary to quantify the uncertainty in the reserves forecasts. This results in an artificially inflated production profile.772\n\nEcuador also objects to Mr. Crick's projection for the extension scenario, but as it argues that Burlington would not have obtained an extension, it limits its discussion to Mr. Crick's nonextension case (CM, \u00b6 433). That being said, in RPS's view, Burlington's extension forecast is \"completely unsupported\" and is contradicted by the documents produced by Burlington. See: RPS ER3, Section 5.3.4.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 721-722, referring to: **Exh. E-523**.\n\nCM, \u00b6 437.\n\n**Exh. E-126**.\n\n**Exh.

Mr. Crick assumes that the Consortium stopped drilling because of the impact of Law 42. This is false: internal ConocoPhillips' documents from 2006 and 2007 show that Burlington would have stopped drilling regardless of the impact of Law 42. These documents (which include the January 2007 Yuralpa Mapping Update,773 the 2007 Latin American Reserves Review,774 the 2007 Sales Memorandum,775 the 2007 Budget Committee Meeting Presentation776 and the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study)777 show that it was the underperformance of this Block and its geological uncertainty, not Law 42, that caused the Consortium to stop drilling.778 Burlington's argument that these documents are not useful for measuring damages because they reflect the impact of Law 42 should be disregarded, as they \"clearly show the information that a willing buyer would have had access to on 30 August 2009 in order to value the Blocks, including that Block 21 had performed lower than expected\".779\n\nii. Mr. Crick ignores the historical underperformance of Block 21 and its difficult geological conditions, in particular the watering out of certain wells.780 While Mr. Crick asserts that this is caused by water coning, this theory \"ignores and contradicts the evidence in Consortium and third-party documents strongly indicating that the source of Yuralpa water production is not water coning, but is associated with discrete zones of high permeability in this very heterogeneous Main Hollin reservoir\".781 Ecuador points out that the 2007 Sales Memorandum and other documents record the difficulties encountered between 2004 and 2007 (which included the watering out of wells, the difficulty of isolating water producing intervals, and lower oil production as a result of water encroachment).782 According to Ecuador, two studies concluded that the problems were caused by fracturing, albeit with different conclusions as to the cause, and confirmed that there were \"unpredictable water problems\" on Block 21.783 Mr. Crick, however, overlooked the significance of these conclusions.\n\niii. Mr. Crick's aggressive well drilling program (according to which 24 additional wells would be drilled, 21 of which before 30 August 2009) (a) is not achievable784 and (b) shows an unrealistic profitability:\n\na. Mr. Crick ignores contemporaneous documents that show that his proposed drilling program was not achievable. The 2007 Sales Memorandum identifies only nine sites for potential drilling in Yuralpa.785 This figure was revised down in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation study,786 which concluded that \"[s]even additional wells was the maximum advisable to ensure complete field development and avoid drilling unnecessary wells\",787 and that first production from the new wells would have occurred in September 2008, and not February 2008, as Mr. Crick and Compass Lexecon assume. As a result, a willing buyer in August 2009 would have relied on documents such as these when assigning a value to the fields.788 In any event, despite what is stated in the Yuralpa Simulation Study, RSP believes that the Yuralpa field was fully developed and new drilling would not have resulted in additional reserves.789\n\nb. Although Compass Lexecon claims to have run a profitability test on Mr. Crick's drilling program, Fair Links has tested Compass Lexecon's conclusions by calculating the Internal Rate of Return (\"IRR\") associated with that program. Fair Links concludes that Mr. Crick's production scenario involves an IRR of 165% for Block 7 and 43% for Block 21, which far exceed the standard profitability rate of 12% for an oil and gas investment.790\n\niv. Finally, for Ecuador, Mr. Crick's forecasting techniques are fundamentally flawed:\n\na. Mr. Crick used aggregated field-level production data to forecast future production from existing wells, which is contrary to recommended industry evaluation practice.791 According to RPS, \"[f]ield-level analysis should only be cautiously considered reliable when field conditions are not changing which was not the case for Yuralpa while Perenco operated the field\".792\n\nb. Mr. Crick used average well curves, which as explained above is problematic, and in this particular case allows a particular over-performing well to have a disproportionate impact. Mr. Crick's use of average decline rates also ignores that, historically, the average initial/peak rate of the wells on Block 21 has fallen significantly with each successive drilling program.793\n\nc. There is no support for the 9% decline curve used by Mr. Crick, either in the performance data of the wells in August 2009 or in the postexpropriation data.794\n\nd. Mr. Crick only applies a reserves adjustment factor to take into account uncertainty to three Yuralpa wells which it identified as 2P wells. This does not properly account for the uncertainty in the production of the remaining wells.795\n\n**Exh. E-555**.\n\n**Exh. E-553**.\n\n**Exh. E-214**.\n\n**Exh.

When comparing the profiles to historical production levels, Fair Links found that \"whereas RPS expected production levels are in line with historical (preAugust 2009) data, the forecasts of John Crick are markedly in excess of past production of Blocks 7 and 21\".799\n\nii. When comparing the production profiles to ConocoPhillips' assessment of the level of reserves, Fair Links found that RPS's projections were consistent with the levels internally assessed by ConocoPhillips, while Mr. Crick's assessment was more than three times higher.800 ConocoPhillips' internal documents show that \"the estimated levels of proved reserves for Blocks 7 and 21 are stable over the years\", and \"do not show any significant expected increase in reserves (future oil production) that would result from the drilling of new wells\".801 Indeed, RPS's results are even \"more optimistic than what ConocoPhillips would have itself considered just before the expropriation\".802\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 476.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 471; Fair Links ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 66-86.\n\nFair Links also considered comparing the production scenarios with the actual production levels achieved by Petroamazonas, but rejected this method, as this would not have been \"comparing like with like\".

As a public company, Petroamazonas is subject to a different tax system and receives 100% production. Indeed, \"contrary to private operators, Petroamazonas' main goal is to maximize production for the state, not profits\",803 which can only be achieved through heavy investment. Petroamazonas also has an unlimited time horizon to recoup its investments. By contrast, \"the Consortium was seeking to maximize the return on its investment for a period limited to the remaining duration of its contract\", and had to give a share of its production to the state and comply with regulations (such as Law 42) which reduced its ability to invest in the Blocks.804\n\nii. \"From a purely technical perspective, Petroamazonas and the Consortium would not have drilled the same wells\".805 In particular, the Consortium would not have drilled the 11 wells that Petroamazonas drilled in Yuralpa in 2011 and 2012 because \"[a]ll but one of the 11 wells in Petroamazonas' 2011/ 2012 drilling campaign would have been considered, per the Consortium's own benchmarks, \u2018low EUR [estimated ultimate recovery] wells.' Therefore, based on the Consortium's own policy, 10 of the 11 wells drilled by Petroamazonas would not have even been drilled\".806 Nor is it likely that the Consortium would have drilled in the fringe area of the Main Hollin reservoir, because that entailed a high degree of risk that Petroamazonas could handle but not the Consortium.807 For the same reason, Mr. Crick cannot rely on the 2013 Ryder Scott Report for his production profile, because all of the 28 new wells shown in the Ryder Scott report are in fringe areas.808 Mr. Crick made clear that the Consortium's avoidance of the fringe areas \"was a deliberate policy to avoid drilling wells that might produce very little oil.809\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 731.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 736.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 738.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 739 (emphasis removed), referring to: RPS ER3, \u00b6 280 and **Exh.

RPS explains that \"the majority of Ryder Scott undeveloped wells are in locations which the Consortium would not drill. Based on the 2011 Ryder Scott net pay map and Perenco's 90-foot minimum oil pay criteria for new wells, the Consortium would not have elected to drill the 21 wells proposed in the southeastern and southern areas by Petroamazonas and Ryder Scott in the June 2013 Ryder Scott Reserves report. It is important to note that the additional seven wells proposed by Petroamazonas and Ryder Scott in the 2013 Ryder Scott report are technically on the \"fringe\" area of the developed Main Hollin reservoir and not in the heart of the developed area where most of Mr. Crick's \u2018infill' wells would be located\". RPS ER4, \u00b6 282.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 744, referring to: Crick WS1, \u00b6 94.\n\n408.\n\nFinally, Ecuador objects to the use of Updated Model to forecast production, for the reasons explained further below.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n409.\n\nThe Tribunal's task is to determine the volume of oil that Burlington would have produced \"but for\" the expropriation. In doing so, the Tribunal will rely on its prior legal determinations.\n\ni. First, the standard of compensation is full reparation. The goal is to determine what Burlington would have produced (and sold) \"but for\" the expropriation, not what a willing buyer would have paid for Burlington's oil assets on the date of the expropriation.\n\nii. Second, a majority of the Tribunal has also found that, to award full reparation, the assets must be valued as at the date of the award (or its closest proxy). As a result, it is appropriate to rely on post-expropriation information, as Mr. Crick has done.\n\niii. Third, the Tribunal has found that the impact of Law 42 must be disregarded. In other words, when projecting Burlington's cash flows in the counterfactual world, it must be assumed that Ecuador complies with its tax absorption obligations, thereby eliminating the impact of Law 42 on Burlington's production.\n\n410.\n\nIt follows that RPS's calculations cannot be used as a basis for the Tribunal's assessment. Indeed, RPS's objective was to forecast the production that a willing buyer would have estimated on the date of the expropriation using information available then and assuming that Burlington's oil production share was affected by Law 42. Even if RPS has carried out this exercise correctly (a question that the Tribunal does not need to address), its calculation is invalidated by these incorrect assumptions.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that RPS's reserve estimates, as well as its assertion that more drilling would not have yielded more reserves, but would merely have accelerated the depletion of existing reserves, have been proven wrong by Petroamazonas' and Ryder Scott's most recent reports.810 In particular, by July 2014, Petroamazonas had already produced more oil from Block 21 than RPS forecast as recoverable. Specifically, RPS forecast a total production of 11.24 million barrels by the end of the Block 21 PSC,811 and an expected ultimate recovery of 39 million barrels,812 while by July 2014 Block 21 had already yielded more than 41 million barrels and was still producing new reserves.813 As for Block 7, RPS forecast production of 3.8 million barrels814 through 2010 and an expected ultimate recovery of 99 million barrels.815 However, from December 2007 to July 2014, Block 7 had produced an additional 50.17 million barrels of oil,816 and by the end of 2013 Petroamazonas had updated its reserve figures to (at least) 761 million barrels.817 The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Crick that \"reality provides the surest check\",818 and reality shows that RPS's projections were wrong. RPS conceded this at the Hearing.819\n\n**Exhs. C-491 and C-493**.

C-492**), the figure of 761 million barrels refers only to the Oso Main Hollin. The total estimated oil in place for the Oso field is 918 million barrels.\n\nCrick WS2, \u00b6 10.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 4) (ENG), 1152:21-1153:20 (Cross, Daigre).\n\n412.\n\nThis does not mean that the Tribunal must adopt Mr. Crick's projections in their entirety. It is well-established that a claim for loss of profits requires the claimant to prove with reasonable certainty that it would have earned the profits sought but for the wrongful act.820 This means that Burlington must prove with reasonable certainty what volumes the Consortium would have produced \"but for\" the expropriation.\n\nSee, for instance: M. M. Whiteman, *Damages in International Law*, vol. II (1937), p. 1837 (noting that the assessment of prospective profits requires proof that \"they were reasonably anticipated; and that the profits anticipated were probable and not merely possible\"). See also: note 434 above.\n\n413.\n\nIt must be stressed that the assumption underlying Mr. Crick's forecast is partially different from the one articulated in the preceding paragraph. Mr. Crick's goal was to establish how much oil the Consortium would have produced had Ecuador complied with its tax absorption obligations *prior* to the expropriation and had there been no expropriation. As a result, he calculates production from December 2007, the date on which the Consortium stopped drilling, allegedly as a result of the enactment of Law 42 at 99% and Ecuador's failure to comply with its tax absorption obligations. By contrast, the Tribunal must quantify the production foregone solely *as a result of the expropriation*. While the Tribunal has determined that this production must be quantified assuming that Ecuador would have complied with its tax absorption obligations *going forward*, it cannot take account of cash flows that would have accrued before the expropriation. As a result, the Tribunal will disregard any cash flows that would have accrued before the expropriation.\n\n414.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address Mr. Crick's forecast for Block 7 (i) and then his forecast for Block 21 (ii). It will end by addressing Ecuador's objections to the use of the Updated Model to forecast production (iii).\n\n(i) *Block 7*\n-------------\n\n415.\n\nWith respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick concludes that the Consortium would have produced 4.3 million barrels of oil from 1 August 2009 to 16 August 2010.821 To arrive at this figure, Mr. Crick has assumed that the Consortium would have produced as much oil as Petroamazonas from the same number of wells in that period.822 The Tribunal accepts this forecast: there is no reason to believe that the Consortium would have produced less oil than Petroamazonas from the same wells during the same time period. The Tribunal is mindful of Ecuador's argument that Petroamazonas is not an appropriate proxy for the Consortium. While it may see the merits of the argument in respect of additional drilling (as discussed below), it rejects it with respect to production from existing wells.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 139-142 and Figure 1.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 142.\n\n416.\n\nWith respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick assumes that, if the Block 7 PSC had expired in August 2010, the Consortium would have continued drilling in the Oso field at a rate of one well per month, but would have stopped drilling one year before the end of the PSC (i.e. in August 2009), when new investments would have become uneconomical.823 This would have resulted in 21 new wells drilled within 21 months (from December 2007 inclusive to August 2009 inclusive).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 140.\n\n417.\n\nIn this connection, the first question that arises is whether it is reasonable to assume that the Consortium would have drilled new wells in Block 7 but for the expropriation. For this purpose, the Tribunal will assume that any new drilling would have restarted after the expropriation, i.e., in September 2009, and not in January 2008, as Mr. Crick assumes. As noted in paragraph 413 above, the Tribunal cannot take into consideration cash flows that would have accrued before the expropriation. The Tribunal has also asked itself whether it may assume that drilling would have restarted in January 2008 for its quantification of cash flows accruing *after* the expropriation (in other words, whether to quantify cash flows accruing after the expropriation it may assume a production profile resulting from new drilling commencing in January 2008). It has concluded that it cannot: while the Tribunal can use the assumptions it considers appropriate to quantify the situation that Burlington would have found itself in, had the expropriation not occurred, it cannot change what happened before the expropriation. As a result, the Tribunal will assume that any new drilling in Block 7 would have resumed in September 2009.\n\n418.\n\nHowever, as noted above, Mr. Crick admits that any new drilling in Block 7 would have stopped one year before the termination of the Block 7 PSC, i.e. in August 2009. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot reasonably assume any drilling in Block 7 beyond that date. The Tribunal thus does not accept Mr. Crick's incremental drilling projections for Block 7.\n\n419.\n\nThe Tribunal has inserted its conclusions with respect to production for existing wells in the Updated Model, and the results are included in the computation provided in Section 5.3.4 below.\n\n(ii) *Block 21*\n---------------\n\n420.\n\nWith respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick forecasts that, between 30 August 2009 and June 2021, when the Block 21 PSC would have expired, the 33 existing wells in the Yuralpa field would have produced 25.7 million barrels of oil. Mr. Crick has reached this figure by applying an initial well production decline rate of 43% that stabilized at 9%.824 The Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Crick's quantification of production, which originally relied on type-curve analysis, is reliable. The Tribunal accepts Mr. Crick's explanations on the reliability of type curve analysis and notes that Dr. Strickland also approved the use of type curve analysis.825 The Tribunal notes in particular that Mr. Crick's type curve analysis for the Yuralpa wells shows a 9% decline rate after 36 to 40 months, whether one looks at the performance of the wells between 2003 and 2004 or between 2006 and 2007.826 In any event, Mr. Crick tested his results through three alternative methods (individual decline curve analysis of existing wells, the 2007 Yuralpa full-field simulation model, and the same updated with data to July 2009 and modified to match performance to that date).827 Notably, Dr. Strickland separately calculated the estimated ultimate recovery (\"EUR\") of Block 21 with four different techniques (rate v. time, type curve, rate v. cumulative, and water to oil ratio v. cumulative) in three subsets of wells and on the entire field (a total of 8 different calculations), and obtained results strikingly similar to Mr. Crick's.828 The Tribunal finds this sufficient to substantiate the use of Mr. Crick's methodology.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, during Dr. Strickland's cross-examination, Ecuador pointed out to a document produced by Burlington identified with Burlington Quantum number BURL-QUANT00021837, at Tab 18 of Dr. Strickland's cross-examination bundle. This document appeared to show the Consortium's year-end reserves estimate for 2004 and contained a note that a 25% exponential decline was \"typical of Hollin wells\" (for P50 wells), noting also a 30% decline for P90 wells. However, Counsel was not able to identify the document, and Dr. Strickland was not able to comment. The Tribunal has considered this document but has given it no weight in its overall assessment based on the record as a whole: the document was never identified, and Ecuador made no mention of it in its Post-Hearing Brief. The Tribunal is also puzzled by the fact that the document was not presented to Mr. Crick, who as a witness was in a better position to identify the document than Dr. Strickland. In any event, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Crick acknowledged a 43% initial decline rate which stabilized at 9%, which is not necessarily inconsistent with this document.\n\nStrickland ER, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 53 (noting that \"Mr. Crick's application of type-curve analysis is consistent with industry methods of forecasting future production for fields where individual wells are not well-behaved\").\n\nTr.

See also: Crick Direct Presentation, Slide 11.\n\nStrickland ER, \u00b6\u00b6 52-68. Dr. Strickland's average results for all four methods were as follows: the aggregate EUR for all three groups of wells was 51,327 million barrels, and the EUR for all Perenco operated wells calculated together was 51,800 million barrels. These results are strikingly similar to Mr. Crick's forecast (52,053 million barrels). Strickland ER, table at p. 23, as revised by Annex 1 distributed during the Hearing (Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 838:8-17; 839:19-22 (Direct, Strickland)).\n\n421.\n\nThe situation for incremental wells is more complex. Mr. Crick forecasts that 24 additional wells would have been drilled in the Yuralpa Main Hollin reservoir, 21 of them 1P wells in the center of the reservoir, and three 2P wells outside that area. The 21 1P wells were to be \"infill\" wells, that is, wells drilled between the existing wells to drain the reservoir. Mr. Crick explains that, because of the water coning in the Yuralpa reservoir, \"the sweep of the Yuralpa Field is not good, and you are getting a very low recovery. There is, therefore, a large amount of oil to be recovered, and the 21 new wells in the center and the 3 other wells are intended to produce as much as possible of that remaining movable oil, producible oil\".829 More specifically, Mr. Crick explains that, as of the date of his first Witness Statement, the wells in the Yuralpa Main Hollin had produced only 14.3% of the developable oil in the reservoir, which is a low number, and that a significant amount of oil remains to be drained.830 The purpose of the infill drilling would be to recover the oil from those unswept areas and would provide additional reserves.831 Mr. Crick assumes a drilling rate of one well per month (which he states is consistent with Perenco's historical drilling rate),832 starting in January 2008 and ending in December 2009. On the basis of the methodology discussed above, Mr. Crick projects that the Consortium would have recovered an additional 12.2 million barrels from these 24 wells.833\n\nTr.

For this, the Tribunal will first determine whether the Consortium would have resumed drilling in Block 21 but for the expropriation and assuming that Ecuador complied with its tax absorption obligations (1), and, if so, how many new wells would reasonably have been drilled until the PSC's expiration (2). It must then determine when such new drilling would have started (3), and whether Mr. Crick's methodology for calculating the volumes to be produced from those new wells is appropriate (4).\n\n(1) But for the expropriation and assuming that Ecuador complied with its tax absorption obligations, would the Consortium have continued drilling in Block 21?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Tribunal must first assess whether, but for the expropriation and assuming that Ecuador complied with its tax absorption obligations, it is reasonable to assume that the Consortium would have continued drilling in Block 21. This is not as evident as for Block 7. Indeed, the Consortium stopped drilling in Block 21 not because of Law 42, but because of problems with the reservoir, which is why it initiated a study of the Yuralpa field. Mr. Crick's testimony is that, but for Ecuador's failure to absorb the effects of Law 42, the Consortium would have waited for the end of the study and recommenced in January 2008.\n\n424.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is reasonable to assume that, but for the expropriation and assuming that Ecuador had complied with its tax absorption obligations, the Consortium would have recommenced drilling. While the record confirms (and, indeed, Burlington does not deny) that the Consortium stopped drilling in 2007 because of problems with the reservoir (in particular water problems)834 and because \"disappointing well results in the latter part of 2006 reduced development opportunities\",835 the documents cited by Ecuador show that the Consortium would have resumed drilling once these problems were identified and measures to increase production were put in place. In particular:\n\ni. The January 2007 Yuralpa Mapping Update836 analyzes the problems in the reservoir and describes possible strategies for drilling new vertical and horizontal wells, including infill drilling, noting a total of 9 contingent wells for the second semester of 2007 and early 2008.837 It also states that the purpose of the 2007 reservoir study and simulation (referred to at (v) below) is to \"[c]onstruct a forecast model for the new well drilling with optimisation of spacing and recommendation on operational parameters such as drawdown, total fluid rates, etc.\".838 Finally, this document also shows the Consortium's concern with Law 42, as it poses a question with respect to \"[e]conomics of new hydrocarbon Law and with the risk of increasing State share\".839\n\nii. The May 2007 Latin American Reserves Review840 states that drilling is currently halted to conduct a field study, noting that the key issue is water production and that reservoir management practices are needed to manage water influx.841 This document also states that 4 additional wells are planned for 2007, contingent on the study.842\n\niii. Similarly, while acknowledging the Consortium's difficulties in developing a drilling program for Block 21, the 2007 Sales Memorandum843 notes that \"a comprehensive field study commenced in October 2006 is being completed in an effort to improve the following geological modeling and reservoir management issues\", listing the various problems encountered in Block 21.844 It then explains that \"[o]nce this field study has been completed (estimated by late summer 2007), the knowledge gained will provide for a more refined reservoir management and development strategy\".845 The document also notes that \"[t]here are significant reserves in infill and offset locations, and the extent of the field to the south and southeast has to be determined\", adding that \"five offset locations\" and \"four infill locations [\u2026] have been identified as potential targets\".846 Notably, the Sales Memorandum also states that \"[e]stimates suggest only a small portion of total oil in place has been produced to date leaving a significant exploitation opportunity\", adding that \"[u]pon the completion of the current reservoir study, improved reservoir management and well operations ought to significantly enhance the productivity of the Block\".847\n\niv. In the same vein, while the September 2007 Budget Presentation848 does state that the \"[m]ain uncertainty for forecasting of new wells is the structure on the Western flank\"849 and that \"[n]o investment is proposed for the first half of 2008\",850 it also indicates that projects could start in the second half of 2008 \"depending on the new Ecuadorian Constitution\".851 It also notes that the \"[r]eservoir model will help define [the] best development strategy\" for Block 21, and indicates that the Consortium is considering drilling between 4 and 8 additional wells on Block 21 in 2008.852\n\nv. Finally, the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study (also called Yuralpa Field Study or Evaluation,853 to which the previous documents refer), clearly envisages further drilling on Block 21. In particular, the study states that \"[t]o increase the remaining reserves additional wells have been considered to be drilled on the Yuralpa Field in [the] second half of 2008\".854 More specifically, it also states that:\n\n\"As a result of history match and predictions with existing wells, two areas have been identified where new wells could be drilled. One is in the southeast part of the reservoir between wells YCF-3 and CHO-01; the other one is in the central area between wells YCD-1 and YCF-4. Sensitivities with drilling between **5** and **7 new wells** and maintaining current liquid rates in existing wells indicate that remaining reserves can be increased to **32.0 MMstb**. Due to added production from new wells, it is predicted that it will be necessary to upgrade water handling capacity to 60,000 stb/d by converting CHO-01 to water disposal well in February 2009. By maintaining current drawdown in existing wells and drilling new infill wells, it can be expected that reserves could be increased even further\".855\n\nSee, for instance: 2007 Sales Memorandum, p. 44 (**Exh. E-214**) (\"Development drilling in Yuralpa has been challenged due to the presence of a massive, unstable and highly fractured Napo formation and a fractured basalt layer above the Hollin reservoir, creating steering and well control problems. A total of 15 wells were drilled in 2005, 14 in 2006, and one well year to date 2007, the YCG-3. This field is under a strong water drive with relatively low mobility (oil reservoir viscosity is 60 cp) and due to earlier than expected water breakthrough in the latest wells, further drilling has been put on hold pending the completion of a reservoir and completion practices study\").\n\nConocoPhillips: Latin America Reserves Review, Ecuador, dated 7 May 2007 (**Exh.

While the document's title appears to be \"Yuralpa Field Upper and Main Hollin Reservoir Geological Modelling & Reservoir *Simulation\",* the header of each page refers to it as \"Yuralpa Field Upper and Main Hollin Reservoir *Evaluation* \". As to the date, while the final version appears to have been issued in June 2008, the document states that \"[e]dited results were presented at a partner TCM in Quito in September 2007\" (p. 1). This was confirmed by Mr. Crick at the Hearing, who testified that the results of the study were presented during the Budget Committee Meeting in September 2007 (Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 409:11-21 (Cross, Crick)). The Tribunal will refer to this document as the \"2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study\", which is the name the Parties have used most frequently.\n\nAnnex E to Crick WS1, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid*., emphasis in original.\n\n425.\n\nDespite this evidence, Ecuador and RPS argue that the Consortium would not have carried out new drilling in Block 21 because the Yuralpa field was fully developed on the date of the expropriation. As has been demonstrated by Petroamazonas' actual figures, which has drilled 39 new wells (out of which 3 re-drills), this contention has been proven wrong.856 Considering that the Block 21 PSC would not expire until 2021, it is reasonable to assume that the Consortium would have continued drilling if there were undrained reserves in the reservoir. Indeed, the September 2007 Budget Presentation notes in this respect that the \"[l]onger remaining time gives more flexibility\"857 (presumably for the Consortium's development strategy), and this was confirmed by Mr. Daigre of RPS at the Hearing.858\n\nSee: paragraph 411 above and paragraph 441 below.\n\n**Exh. C-470**, Slide 164.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 4) (ENG), 1082:14-20 (Cross, Daigre).\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, but for the expropriation and assuming that Ecuador complies with its tax absorption obligations, the Consortium would have restarted drilling after the completion of the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study.\n\n(2) How many new wells would reasonably have been drilled in Block 21?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n427.\n\nThe next question is how many wells it is reasonable to assume that the Consortium would have drilled until the expiration of the Block 21 PSC. The Tribunal will first assess whether Mr. Crick's incremental drilling forecast for Block 21 is reasonable. To recall, Mr. Crick proposed 24 wells, 21 of which would have been 1P infill wells in the center of the reservoir, in the 1900 acre area with an oil column greater than 90 feet, plus three 2P wells outside that area. According to Mr. Crick, these wells would have been drilled between January 2008 and December 2009 at a rate of one per month. In the Tribunal's view, for reasons relating to the number of wells forecast and their type and location, Mr. Crick's projections are overly aggressive.\n\n428.\n\nFirst, Ecuador has pointed out the \"significant discrepancy\" between the number of new wells proposed by Mr. Crick, and the number of wells that the Consortium had envisaged drilling prior to the expropriation, a discrepancy which Mr. Crick acknowledged at the Hearing.859 Indeed, while the 2007 Budget Presentation considered a preliminary program of 4 to 8 wells, and the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study proposed drilling between 5 and 7 wells, Mr. Crick has proposed that 24 new wells would have been drilled.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 414:12-16 (Cross, Crick).\n\n429.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal must consider if the location and technical characteristics of the wells proposed by Mr. Crick are reasonable. 21 of Mr. Crick's 24 wells were to be \"infill wells\" drilled in the center of the reservoir, i.e., wells drilled between existing wells in an area that had already been drilled.860 According to Mr. Crick, although there had been drilling in this area, only approximately 14% of the oil had been recovered. For Mr. Crick, this low recovery is mostly due to water coning and infill wells would allow the Consortium to recover oil that had not been swept by the current wells.861 In the Tribunal's understanding, infill drilling as suggested by Mr. Crick is linked to the existence of water coning.862\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 59; 98-101.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 95; Crick WS2, \u00b6 146; Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 414:21-416:21 (Cross, Crick).\n\nSee, for instance: Crick WS2, \u00b6 146; Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 414:21-416:21 Cross, Crick).\n\n430.\n\nThe existence of water coning in Yuralpa is disputed. While Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland affirm that the water encroachment problems in the Yuralpa field are a result of water coning,863 RPS denies this and opines instead that these problems are caused by fracturing.864\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 54-65; Crick WS2, \u00b6 146; Strickland ER, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 18-40.\n\nRPS ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 429-450. In particular, RPS notes that two studies commissioned by the Consortium, one by Beicip-Franlab in 2005 (Geomechanical audit of Yuralpa field, Final Report, June 2005) and another by Geoscience (2007 Geomechanical Model for the Main Hollin Reservoir) dismissed water coning as the cause of the water encroachment and instead posited that the probable cause for the water surges was fracturing.\n\n431.\n\nMr. Crick explains that one of the \"result[s] of the Main Hollin's powerful aquifer is that the water beneath the reservoir tends to push directly upwards underneath the producing wells thereby displacing the oil. This is a common process known as \u2018water coning' because the water forms a cone-like shape beneath the oil in each producing well\".865 According to Mr. Crick, \"[t]he existence of water coning in the Blocks is apparent from a simple application of physics\", as a result of the characteristics of the field.866 Dr. Strickland shares this view and adds that the characteristics of the Yuralpa Main Hollin are such that its production will necessarily be affected by water coning.867 Dr. Strickland explains:\n\n\"If the pressure in the reservoir is greater than the pressure at the perforations in the well bore, oil and water will move from the high-pressure region to the lower-pressure perforations. Water coning occurs when water moves towards a low-pressure area surrounding the well perforations. If the oil is viscous and not much lighter than water, as is the case in Yuralpa, water can break through the oil and swiftly move up into the perforations, resulting in a high percentage of water produced with the oil (a high \"water cut,\" which is measured as a percentage of total fluid production)\".868\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6 54.\n\nCrick WS2, \u00b6 114. Mr. Crick explains that \"[t]he force keeping the water below the oil \u2013 the gravity force \u2013 is weak and cannot be modified. But the force moving the oil and water towards the wellbore \u2013 the viscous force \u2013 is much stronger under economic production scenarios. Therefore, it is easy for the water to move upward towards the wellbore, breaking through the oil and forming a \u2018water cone.' Moreover, once the cone is formed it can take a very long time before it settles, given that only the weak gravity force is trying to move the cone down by moving the viscous oil into the cone. [\u2026]\". Crick WS2, \u00b6 115.\n\nStrickland ER, \u00b6 18.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 19.\n\n432.\n\nThese explanations suggest that water coning is the direct result of the geology and characteristics of the field. The Tribunal accepts this explanation, which is shared by both Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland. The Tribunal has noted RPS's critique of Mr. Crick's water coning theory,869 but finds that Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland have sufficiently substantiated their views.\n\nIn particular, RPS maintains that \"[w]ell performance data indicates that water coning is not occurring in the reservoir to a degree which would affect production\", and that in the 9 wells which experienced drops in the percentage of water (water cut) produced (which could be an indication of coning), the reason for the drops in water were water shut-off workovers. RPS ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 431-432.\n\n433.\n\nIt is true, as RPS has pointed out, that there is almost no reference to water coning in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study or in the other documents which analyzed the water encroachment in the Yuralpa field.870 However, while the Yuralpa Simulation Study does not use the term, Dr. Strickland testified that that Study clearly described the phenomenon of water coning.871\n\nRPS ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 429-430.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 869:2-6 (Cross, Strickland) (\"I can't speak for the author of this\u2014of this, but their model describes exactly the process that I call water coning in the presence of shale barriers, and I think it is exactly the mechanism that I attribute to the production of the field\").\n\n434.\n\nIn addition, several of the documents cited in paragraph 424 above show that the Consortium was considering infill drilling in the Yuralpa field (see in particular the Yuralpa Mapping Update,872 the 2007 Sales Memorandum873 and the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study).874 If, as the Tribunal understands, infill drilling is linked to the presence of water coning, the fact that the Consortium was considering infill drilling in Yuralpa suggests that the Consortium believed that water coning was at least part of the problem. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that, in principle, a drilling plan that considers infill drilling is reasonable in the Yuralpa field.\n\nJanuary 2007 Yuralpa Mapping Update, Slides 4, 16-19, 23, 29 (**Exh. E-555**).\n\n2007 Sales Memorandum, p. 45 (**Exh. E-214**).\n\nAnnex E to Crick WS1, pp. 2-3.\n\n435.\n\nThat being said, an aggressive infill drilling program in the center of the reservoir such as the one proposed by Mr. Crick finds little support in the Consortium's drilling plans. As noted in paragraph 424.v above, the seven wells proposed in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study were to be drilled in two potential areas: \"[o]ne is in the southeast part of the reservoir between wells YCF-3 and CHO-01; the other one is in the central area between wells YCD-1 and YCF-4\".875 Four of these wells (wells YCF-AH5, YCF-BH4, YCF-CH2 and YCI-AH2) were to be drilled in the unswept southeast part of the field two wells (YCF-EH and YCF-GH) in the central area, and one well (YCF-5ST2) would replace YCF-5H.876 These locations are shown in Figure 166 to the Yuralpa Simulation Study, which is reproduced below. Six of these wells were to be drilled in areas of oil depth between 125 and 225 feet (marked in salmon and red colors), and only one in an area below 100 feet (shown in green). But only two of these proposed wells (YCF-GH or YCF-EH) could be deemed to correspond to the characteristics proposed by Mr. Crick (i.e., infill wells in the center of the reservoir).877\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., p. 37.\n\nMr. Crick refers more to \"the 1900 acre area with an oil column greater than 90 feet\" (Crick WS1, \u00b6 98), which the Tribunal understands to refer to the large red to yellow area shown in the center of the reservoir. During the Hearing Mr. Crick confirmed that the 21 infill wells were to be in the center of the reservoir. Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 415:10-11 (Cross, Crick).\n\n436.\n\nSimilarly, as noted above the 2007 Budget Presentation considered a preliminary program of 4 to 8 wells.878 This program consisted of (i) drilling well YCF-5ST, one to two V wells and two to three H wells on Pad F, and (ii) two additional V wells, presumably in Pad D (i.e., a maximum of 8 wells).879 However, as shown in the slide below, only 6 wells were in fact scheduled in the last semester of 2008 (four in Pad F, and two in an unnamed \"Pad\" which the Tribunal understands to be Pad D):880\n\nConsortium Budget Committee Meeting Presentation, September 26-27, 2007, Slide 164 (**Exh. C-470**).\n\n*Id*., Slide 164. See also: Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 410:15-412:21 (Cross, Crick).\n\n*Id*., Slide 165. This schedule shows drilling in Pad F and in another pad simply identified as \"Pad\". The Tribunal understands that this unnamed pad refers to Pad D, which is the other pad identified in the map at Slide 166.\n\n437.\n\nAs shown in the following map provided in the same presentation, Pad F is in the southeastern area of the field (circled in red), while Pad D is in the center of the field (circled in blue):881\n\n*Id*., Slide 166.\n\n438.\n\nOnce again, the Consortium's plans do not match Mr. Crick's proposal, as most of the wells that the Consortium planned to drill were in the southeastern part of the field.882\n\nSee: Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 410:15-412:21 (Cross, Crick).\n\n439.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that the Consortium would not have considered drilling infill wells in the future. Indeed, as noted above, several of the Consortium documents referred to the possibility of infill drilling. In particular, the Yuralpa Simulation Study noted that reserves could be increased, inter alia, by \"drilling new infill wells\",883 for which more detailed geological work and simulations would need to be undertaken.884 But the record does not support Mr. Crick's drilling forecast of 21 infill wells.\n\nAnnex E to Crick WS1, p. 2.\n\n*Id*., p. 3 (\"In case new infill wells are to be drilled, more detailed geological work including core and FMI data should be undertaken in the potential drilling areas. Simulation results with new infill wells should be economically evaluated in order to select the optimal locations. The constantly updated simulation model should be the tool for defining the production policy of the Yuralpa field\").\n\n440.\n\nBy contrast, the documents cited above appear to support Mr. Crick's proposed three 2P wells outside the central part of the reservoir. While Mr. Crick has testified that it was the Consortium's policy not to drill in the fringe areas (i.e., the areas where the oil column was less than 90 feet deep),885 the Consortium was clearly planning to explore the deeper oil column identified in the southeastern area of the reservoir. While there is some contradiction between the Consortium's plans and Mr. Crick's proposal (Mr. Crick locates these wells in the fringe area and acknowledges the uncertainty of their production, while the Consortium appears to have been aiming for a deeper oil column), they both share the goal to test and drain the unswept areas of the reservoir outside the central oil column.\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6 94. However, Mr. Crick also notes that the Consortium did drill in the fringe in some instances (\"Perenco did not expect to develop the portion of the reservoir toward the edges where the total oil thickness is less than about 90 feet. This was a deliberate policy to avoid drilling wells that might produce very little oil. That said, some wells were drilled in this fringe, and although they are not amongst the best producers, they have cumulatively produced 3.04 million barrels of oil, and are still producing. Overall these remain very economic wells\").\n\n441.\n\nDespite the discrepancy between the Consortium's historical plans and Mr. Crick's proposal (which he has acknowledged),886 Mr. Crick has affirmed that his drilling program is reasonable in light of Petroamazonas' actual and proposed drilling. It is true that, since the expropriation, Petroamazonas has drilled 11 new wells in Yuralpa (8 if one does not count the re-drills)887 and appears to be planning to drill another 28 wells in that field,888 which makes a total of 39 new wells (or 36 if we ignore the 3 re-drills), compared to Mr. Crick's 24 new wells. However, the Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that Petroamazonas is not an entirely appropriate proxy for the Consortium in this regard.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 414:12-16 (Cross, Crick).\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 323, relying on: RPS ER3, \u00b6 280. Mr. Crick has also referred to 11 wells, specifically, to 8 new wells and 3 re-drills. (Crick WS2, \u00b6 188). Although Mr. Crick explained at the Hearing that the re-drills do not yield new wells, but rather \"you subtract one well and then add it back in a slightly different place, so the total number of wells is not changed by the redrill\" (Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 447:9-14 (Cross, Crick)), which would suggest that Petroamazonas has only drilled 8 new wells, Ecuador and RPS continue to speak of 11 new wells.\n\nWhile Mr. Crick had identified these 28 new wells as proposed by Ryder Scott, counsel for Ecuador have stated that they appear to have been originally proposed by Petroamazonas and approved by Ryder Scott. See: Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 873:15-874:19 (Cross, Strickland).\n\n442.\n\nIndeed, the wells that Petroamazonas has drilled or proposes to drill in the future are mostly of a different type or are in a different location from those proposed by Mr. Crick. Specifically:\n\ni. Of the 11 new wells drilled by Petroamazonas between 2011 and 2013, 7 were in the areas recommended in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study, and an additional 4 were in areas which RPS considers to be infill wells.889 The locations of these wells is shown in the following figure submitted by RPS:890\n\nRPS ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 280, 478.\n\n*Id.*, Figure 46.\n\n443.\n\nThe following image is a close up of the same map:\n\n444.\n\nAs explained by RPS, the locations drilled by Petroamazonas in Areas 1 and 2 are essentially the same locations recommended in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study, two of them in Area 1 (to the southeast) and five in Area 2 (in the center).891 According to RPS, the four additional wells were drilled as \"replacement\" wells, and to test infill drilling.892 In RPS's view, Petroamazonas' actual drilling between 2011 and 2013 resulted in \"relatively poor results\", which would have been considered a failure by the Consortium's standards.893 Dr. Strickland disagrees.894 Be that as it may, Petroamazonas' actual drilling does not support Mr. Crick's plan of 21 infill wells.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 479.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRPS ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 480-481; RPS ER4, \u00b6\u00b6 267-269. RPS explains that \"[o]nly one well of the 11 wells drilled, the D-5H, has a 2P EUR greater than 315,000 barrels of oil based on forecasts using production history through 31 March 2013. The average 2P EUR for all 11 wells is 240,000 barrels per well \u2013 this includes the 1,147,000 barrels for the D-5H. If the D-5H is excluded from the average, the remaining 10 wells are expected to recover an average of 150,000 barrels each\" (RPS ER3, \u00b6 480 and Table 3).\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 880:7-881:5 (Cross, Strickland).\n\n445.\n\nIn addition, as RPS has explained, all of the 28 new wells proposed by Petroamazonas and approved by Ryder Scott in Block 21 would be situated in the fringe areas.895 The difference between Petroamazonas' and Mr. Crick's drilling programs is illustrated in the following figure, which shows RPS's depiction of the Ryder Scott/Petroamazonas wells in red and Mr. Crick's proposed wells in black.896 RPS recognizes that Mr. Crick has not identified the exact location of its proposed wells,897 but considers that \"Mr. Crick's description of the locations in the text of his first witness statement leaves little doubt as to the locations he envisions\".898 As Mr. Crick described his twenty-one 1P wells as infill wells in the center of the reservoir (see paragraph 429 above), spaced approximately 40 acres apart, the Tribunal is satisfied that the figure below shows a reasonable approximation of the location of Mr. Crick's proposed wells.\n\nRPS ER4, \u00b6 282.\n\n*Id.*, Figure 22.\n\nRPS also criticized Mr. Crick's failure to identify the exact location of these prospective wells. It states that \"[a]s per industry standards, it is always the case for any reserves reporting purposes that drilling locations for undeveloped reserves are specifically identified in the report to allow third parties to confirm the validity and test the \u2018reasonable certainty' of recovery of those undeveloped reserves. As per the SPE-PRMS Reserves definitions, Proved reserves in undeveloped locations can only be assigned if the \u2018locations are in undrilled areas of the reservoir that can be judged with reasonable certainty to be commercially productive.' Mr. Crick's failure to specifically identify these locations adds to the uncertainty of those reserves and Mr. Crick's \u2018water coning' theory\". *Id.*, \u00b6 277.\n\nRPS ER3, \u00b6 273, note 257.\n\n446.\n\nThis figure confirms that almost all of Petroamazonas' proposed wells are in the fringe area of the reservoir. In view of Mr. Crick's testimony that it was the Consortium's policy not to drill on the fringe,899 it would not be reasonable to assume that the Consortium would have drilled in these areas (with the exception of a few selected wells to test the deeper oil reserves in the southeastern area, as noted in paragraph 440 above).\n\nCrick WS1, \u00b6 94.\n\n447.\n\nThe Consortium's past practice and Petroamazonas' current practice thus do not support the extent of Mr. Crick's drilling program. While the Tribunal accepts the existence of water coning and the appropriateness of drilling infill wells, the record does not support the drilling of 21 new infill wells in the center of the reservoir.\n\n448.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Crick's program of 21 infill wells in the center of the reservoir is inconsistent with the Consortium's past practice and expectations. It must thus establish on the basis of the elements in the record how many wells it is sufficiently certain that the Consortium would have drilled during the remainder of the Block 21 PSC, and at what rate.\n\n449.\n\nAs noted above, the record suggests that, by September 2007 (before the enactment of Decree 662), the Consortium was only planning to drill a maximum of 8 new wells in Yuralpa, only 6 of which were scheduled, starting in the second half of 2008.900 In view of all of the factors analyzed above, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude that the Consortium would have drilled the 6 scheduled wells, all in 1P locations.\n\nSee: paragraph 436 above.\n\n(3) When would drilling have resumed, and at what rate?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nMr. Crick's production forecast assumes that, but for Ecuador's failure to absorb the effects of Law 42 at 99%, drilling would have resumed in Block 21 in January 2008. The record suggests that this drilling would actually have started in July 2008, not in January 2008 as Mr. Crick proposes.901 That being said, as explained with respect to Block 7, the Tribunal will not quantify cash flows on the basis of new drilling that would have started before the expropriation. It will thus assume that any new drilling would have started in September 2009, after the expropriation.\n\n**Exh. C-470**, Slide 165. See: paragraph 436 above.\n\n451.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted Ecuador's concern that the Updated Model does not contain a functionality allowing the Tribunal to adjust the start date of new drilling, as Fair Links suggested. According to Fair Links, this could have been useful because \"changing the starting date of the drilling program would impact projected production: as the terms of the Participation Contracts are limited and relatively short (notably on Block 7), any change in the starting date of the drilling program in fact would alter the marginal return of each investment, potentially leading to a decision not to drill\".902 Both experts discarded this possibility because they \"cannot reasonably allocate changes in operating and investment costs that are associated to changes in the timing of drilling of new wells because implementing such a manual input in the Joint Model is technically complex and would require to involve technical and geological experts in order to avoid inconsistent outcomes\".903 Ecuador therefore proposes that, should the Tribunal consider implementing this functionality, it should seek the input of the geological and petroleum reservoir experts.904\n\nCompass Lexecon and Fair Links Joint Memorandum of 20 September 2016, \u00b6 12(c), \u00b6 21.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nEcuador's letter of 4 October 2016, p. 9.\n\n452.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that such a functionality could have been useful. However, quantum issues have undergone several rounds and Ecuador could have requested this function in March 2015, when the Tribunal invited the experts to prepare the first Joint Valuation Model. At this late stage, Ecuador's request must be balanced against the need for procedural efficiency.\n\n453.\n\nIn addition, it is well established that, once the existence of damage is established, the Tribunal has wide discretion to determine its quantum. The Tribunal is satisfied that using the current functionalities contained in the Updated Model allows it to quantify Burlington's losses with reasonable certainty, even if it defers the starting date of new drilling to September 2009. Specifically, the Tribunal has considered that the deferral of the start of new drilling shifts the cash flows resulting from new wells forward approximately 1.5 years (from January 2008 to September 2009). Assuming that Burlington would have drilled 6 new wells in Block 21, and assuming that all wells produce equally, by the end of the PSC's life these new wells would have accounted for 15% of all cash flows.905 If the Tribunal assumes that new wells were drilled 1.5 years later than has been calculated in the Updated Model, this deferral can be accounted for by reducing the cash flows in the last 1.5 years of the PSC's life (i.e., from January 2020 to June 2021) by 15%. On the basis of the spreadsheet in the Updated Model where annual cash flows are calculated and, after applying the appropriate variables, the Tribunal has quantified the impact of new wells in Block 21 at USD 3,238,801. The Tribunal will therefore subtract this amount after computing the total cash flows with the Updated Model.\n\nAt the time of the expropriation, there were 33 existing wells in Block 21. Adding 6 new wells gives a total of 39 wells, out of which the new wells account for 15%.\n\n454.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that this is an approximation,906 it considers that it reasonably addresses the inability of the Updated Model to account for a deferral in the drilling start date.\n\nAmong other things, the Tribunal is aware that the amount it has calculated has not been discounted to account for the fact that it would only have been earned in 2020-2021.\n\n455.\n\nAs for the drilling rate, the record supports the rate proposed by Mr. Crick. Indeed, the tentative schedule set out in the 2007 Budget Presentation shows that the Consortium was planning to drill new wells at a rate of one well every 20 days.907 As a result, the Tribunal accepts Mr. Crick's drilling rate.\n\n**Exh. C-470**, Slide 165. See: paragraph 436 above.\n\n(4) Production from incremental wells\n-------------------------------------\n\n456.\n\nWith respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick forecasted production using type-curve analysis. He took empirical data from existing wells to project the initial oil rate, and then applied the historical production decline rate (43% during the first 24 months of production and 9% thereafter). For the reasons given at paragraph 420 above, the Tribunal accepts Mr. Crick's methodology. The Tribunal notes in particular that Mr. Crick tested his results against three alternative methods, and Dr. Strickland independently reached very similar results.\n\n457.\n\nThe Tribunal has inserted its conclusions with respect to production for existing and incremental wells in the experts' Updated Model, and the results are included in the computation provided in Section 5.3.4 below.\n\n458.\n\nHowever, because the Tribunal may only quantify foregone cash flows as of 30 August 2009, it will disregard cash flows computed by Compass Lexecon between January 2008 and August 2009.\n\n(iii) *Ecuador\u2019s objections to the use of the Updated Model to forecast production*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nEcuador objects to the use of the Updated Model to calculate production, because it objects to Mr. Crick's drilling plans, which it considers unsupported and unsound, and because \"given that RPS did not contemplate any new drilling, the \u2018Manual Input' option is constructed on the basis of the drilling plans put forth by Mr. Crick\".908 According to Ecuador, this means that \"in the Updated Model, any new wells that the Tribunal may be inclined to retain would be drilled according to the schedule, with the frequency and in the order proposed by Mr. Crick, and would produce the amounts of oil forecasted by Mr. Crick\":909\n\nEcuador's letter of 4 October 2016, p. 7.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it has dismissed Mr. Crick's drilling projections, and has opted instead for drilling projections based on the Consortium's historical practice and drilling plans in 2007-2008. Ecuador is correct, however, when it states that, for any new wells, the Updated Model will assume Mr. Crick's drilling rate, order and production forecasts. Ecuador submits that this is problematic for four reasons.\n\n461.\n\nFirst, Ecuador notes that the Updated Model does not allow the Tribunal to insert the rate at which new wells would have been drilled, as the Tribunal requested. It adds that, according to the experts, this instruction could not be reasonably implemented because it would have had an impact on costs or might entail unknown geological, operational or technical restrictions. Ecuador emphasizes that \"[u]ltimately, the Tribunal has not been briefed by either Party on any rate allowing for the drilling of more than one well per month. If the Tribunal were minded to consider a drilling rate of less than one well per month, Ecuador proposes that the Tribunal request the input of the geological and petroleum reservoir experts to implement such a functionality in the Updated Model\".910\n\n*Id*., p. 8.\n\n462.\n\nIt is true that the experts were not able to implement a functionality allowing the Tribunal could choose the drilling rate for new wells. The experts explained that changes in the drilling pace would have implications on the design of the drilling plans and alter investment costs, and consequently the marginal profitability associated with investment decisions. Consequently, changes in the drilling pace would lead to an iterative process which would require geological expertise to determine whether new wells would be profitable or technically feasible.911 That being said, the Tribunal has found that the drilling rate proposed by Mr. Crick (i.e. one well per month) is in line with the Consortium's historical practice and is thus reasonable, and as a result this *caveat* (and Ecuador's objection) has become moot.\n\nCompass Lexecon and Fair Links Joint Memorandum of 20 September 2016, \u00b6 12(c).\n\n463.\n\nSecond, Ecuador notes that Fair Links considered including a functionality that would allow the Tribunal to adjust the time when new drilling would have started. Ecuador therefore proposes that, should the Tribunal consider implementing this functionality, it should seek the input of the geological and petroleum reservoir experts.912 The Tribunal has already addressed this request in paragraphs 450 *et seq.* above.\n\nEcuador's letter of 4 October 2016, p. 9.\n\n464.\n\nThird, as in Ecuador's contention the Consortium was not entitled to a contract extension for Block 7, it considers that the drilling plan associated with Burlington's extension scenario is baseless. As the Tribunal has dismissed this claim (and, by the same token, the associated drilling plan), this objection is now moot.\n\n465.\n\nFourth, Ecuador contends that \"the production of such wells, as estimated by Mr. Crick, is unduly optimistic, as it is based on unsound forecasting methodology\".913 Ecuador submits that, to remedy this defect, \"the functionality proposed by Fair Links allowing for the adjustment of the productivity of the new wells should, at the very least, be incorporated into the \u2018Manual Input' option and considered by the Tribunal\".914 The Tribunal rejects this proposal as unnecessary: the Tribunal has found that Mr. Crick's production forecasts (both for existing and new wells, where appropriate) were reasonable and well-supported,915 so even if this functionality had been available, the Tribunal would have chosen Mr. Crick's production forecasts.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., p. 10.\n\nSee: paragraphs 415, 420 and 456 above.\n\n466.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal considers that its reliance on the Updated Model to calculate production is reasonable and well-supported.\n\n**5.2.2 Crude oil prices**\n--------------------------\n\n467.\n\nThe second element to determine revenues is the price at which the crude oil would have been sold. Each Party relies on the prices provided by its financial experts, having instructed them on the date of valuation to be used, namely the date of the award or closest proxy for Burlington and the date of the expropriation for Ecuador.\n\n468.\n\nThe experts agree that Block 7 produced Oriente crude oil, while Block 21 produced mostly Napo crude oil.916 They also agree that, since there are no standard industry forecasts for Oriente or Napo prices, it is necessary to forecast their price with reference to a benchmark crude price, adjusted by an average historical price discount.917 The main differences among the experts relate to (i) the benchmark crude oil used as reference, (ii) the methodology to forecast future prices, and (iii) the use of projected versus actual prices.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 43; Fair Links ER2, \u00b6 96.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 43; Fair Links ER2, \u00b6 97.\n\n469.\n\nFor the benchmark crude oil used to project prices, Compass Lexecon favors North Sea Brent crude (\"Brent\"), while Fair Links uses West Texas Intermediate crude (\"WTI\"). Compass Lexecon's rationale for preferring Brent is that, from 2010 onwards, WTI started selling at a large discount to Brent \"primarily due to increased North American production and limited pipeline capacity\".918 However, Compass Lexecon does not object to using WTI for forecasts made in 2009 (assuming a date of valuation in that year), because this was before the divergence between Brent and WTI.919 Fair Links does not explain why it prefers WTI over Brent, but recognizes that Brent is \"the other widely accepted crude oil reference\".920 While Fair Links acknowledges that WTI fell compared to Brent in late 2010, it considers it irrelevant because it has conducted its valuation as of 30 August 2009.921\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 51(b).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 98.\n\nFair Links, \u00b6 98, note 91.\n\n470.\n\nIn terms of methodology, Compass Lexecon calculates a forecast for the price of Brent crude, and then applies a differential to the Brent forecast series based on the historical relationship between Brent and Oriente/Napo prices.922 To forecast Brent prices, Compass Lexecon explains that it has not limited itself to futures contracts (as Fair Links has done), but has relied \"on as many industry sources as possible (i.e., government agencies such as the EIA, industry analysts, industry consultants such as AJM and Sproule, and market data from futures contracts)\".923\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 52(c).\n\n471.\n\nCompass Lexecon explains that Oriente and Napo prices have consistently traded at a discount to Brent prices, because they are heavier and sourer than Brent and thus involve higher refining costs. To calculate this historical price differential, Compass Lexecon has preferred absolute price level differentials (i.e., the absolute difference in price between Brent and Oriente/Napo measured in US dollars) to price percentage differences (i.e., the log difference in price measured on a percentage basis), because the latter have been historically more volatile and because the former is more reliable being \"supported by the idea that the heavy-light differential is primarily determined by fixed-cost components (namely refining capacity and technology)\".924\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 47.\n\n472.\n\nIn turn, Fair Links bases its projections on the price of WTI futures contracts as of August 2009. It explains that \"[f]utures contracts can be considered as broadly accepted price indicators since they provide a reasonable understanding of what the market consensus on crude oil prices is at a given time\".925 Indeed, Ecuador argues that prices of futures contracts \"are the only indicator providing a summary of the expectations of every participant in the marketplace\".926 Because \"[f]utures contracts are usually considered to provide an accurate view of market price expectations for maximum periods of 5-6 years, given the inherently speculative predictions of prices over longer time periods\",927 Fair Links uses the prices of crude oil futures listed six years forward to project prices between 2009 and 2015. Beyond August 2015, it applies a constant growth rate corresponding to the expected inflation rate as of 2009. It then adjusts both sets of forecasts by the average historical price difference between the WTI price and the Oriente/Napo price to account for difference in quality.928\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 93.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 675-676.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 94.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 93-100.\n\n473.\n\nThe most important difference between the experts concerns the use of projected versus historical prices. Consistent with their instructions on the date of valuation, Fair Links makes its forecasts with information available on the date of the expropriation, while Compass Lexecon uses data available on the date of the nearest proxy to the award (15 September 2014 for its second report, and 31 March 2015 for the Model, and 31 August 2016 for the Updated Model).929 Ecuador criticizes Compass Lexecon because, by using actual price data, it is improperly relying on hindsight information instead of placing itself in the position of a willing buyer on 30 August 2009.930 For Fair Links, \"[t]his approach does not reflect the Fair Market Value of Burlington's assets at the time of expropriation, i.e. August 2009 but an *ex post* understanding of an economic situation that could not have been anticipated back then\".931 Fair Links notes that \"taking into account subsequent events would tend to consider lost cash flows as the compensation standard rather than the Fair Market Value standard, which we understand is the compensation standard applicable in cases of expropriation under the Ecuador-US Bilateral Investment Treaty\".932\n\nCompass Lexecon and Fair Links Joint Memorandum of 20 September 2016, \u00b6 24.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 678-679.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 102.\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6 70.\n\n474.\n\nIn any event, Fair Links notes that the use of actual oil prices following the recent drop in international crude prices would result in a much lower valuation than that advanced in Compass Lexecon's reports. Indeed, Compass Lexecon's adjusted price projections in its second report (based on July 2014 prices) were 6% lower than in its first report.933 According to Fair Links, the use of actual prices on the date of the award would further decrease the valuation of Burlington's assets: if Compass Lexecon were to use December 2014 prices instead of July 2014 prices, the forecast prices over the 2015-2021 period would be US$ 29.56/barrel less than those used in Compass Lexecon's second report, thereby reducing the value quantified by Compass Lexecon by approximately US$ 80 million.934\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 57.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 680.\n\n475.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal stresses that the experts' forecasts are influenced by their instructions on the date of valuation, which depend in turn on the compensation standard that each Party chose to use.\n\n476.\n\nAs explained in Section VII.B.3 above, the standard of compensation in this case is the international law principle of full reparation. The Tribunal must thus award Burlington the value of its investment on the date of the award or a proxy for that date), not to award what a willing buyer would have paid for such investment on the date of the expropriation. As a result, it is appropriate to award Burlington the cash flows that it forewent as a result of the expropriation, adjusted to present value (through an actualization rate for past cash flows and a discount rate for future cash flows).\n\n477.\n\nTo value the asset on the date of the award, the Tribunal may use information available after the date of the expropriation. As explained in Section VII.B.3 above, the use of *ex post* information allows for a valuation that is closer to reality and less speculative than one that relies on projections based on information available on the date of the expropriation.\n\n478.\n\nFair Links points out that the use of actual information would mean that \"the damage assessment will never be fixed until the Block 21 Contract comes to an end in 2021 as oil prices would need to be constantly updated so as to reflect the actual evolution of the lost cash flows\".935 This criticism misunderstands the model adopted by the Tribunal: past cash flows, i.e., cash flows that would have accrued from the expropriation to the date of the award, are calculated on the basis of actual information, while future cash flows, i.e., cash flows that would have accrued from the date of the award to the contract's termination date) are projected on the basis of the latest information available on the date of the valuation. While this computation may not reflect perfectly the actual value of the cash flows had the contracts been performed until their term, it allows for a valuation that reflects reality as much as possible on the basis of information available when the award is made.\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6 71.\n\n479.\n\nFor this purpose, the Tribunal requested the experts in July 2016 to update the values used in their Model. The latest projections prepared by Compass Lexecon for the Updated Model reflects the drop in oil prices since 2014.\n\n480.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal accepts that Brent crude is a better benchmark for the price of Oriente and Napo crude in the circumstances. As explained by Compass Lexecon and recognized by Fair Links, the price of WTI experienced a drop as of 2010 due to factors specific to the North American market and is therefore inappropriate as a benchmark after that date. Nor does Fair Links dispute that Brent is a widely used benchmark.\n\n481.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that Compass Lexecon's forecast is more reliable because it is based on a variety of industry sources, not only on futures contracts. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Ecuador's contention that futures contracts are \"the only indicator providing a summary of the expectations of every participant in the marketplace\".936 As Compass Lexecon explains, by relying on a single source, Fair Links \"ignores all other available forecasts (such as those from government agencies such as the EIA and industry consultants such as AJM and Sproule)\".937 In addition, because the Tribunal is carrying out an *ex post* valuation, it is more appropriate to rely on both actual and forecast pricing of goods, including futures contracts, rather than solely on futures.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 675-676.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 52.\n\n**5.2.3 Operating expenditures (OPEX)**\n---------------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nBurlington relies on its actual operating expenditures (\"OPEX\"), while Ecuador relies on OPEX proposed by Fair Links and RPS.\n\n483.\n\nCompass Lexecon explains that OPEX include (a) direct and indirect costs of producing oil and (b) selling, general and administrative costs associated with managing the Blocks. Compass Lexecon forecasts OPEX on the basis of historical costs: it \"project[s] all variable Opex on a per barrel basis, based on the cost per barrel amount for 2008 [\u2026], the latest full-year available before expropriation\", and \"forecast[s] the administrative costs associated with each Block on a fixed basis, based on the average administrative costs for 2006 through 2008\".938 It then adjusts variable and fixed OPEX for US PPI inflation.939\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 49.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n484.\n\nIn addition, as a result of Mr. Crick's expected production profile and associated costs of development for Block 21, Compass Lexecon \"escalate[s] direct extraction costs and the cost of fluid, lubricants, and chemicals (a component of indirect extraction costs) by the evolution of the ratio of water to crude oil production\".940\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n485.\n\nFair Links also distinguishes between fixed and variable OPEX, but uses RPS's forecast for these costs, which is also based on historical figures. It then adjusts these costs for inflation using 2009 inflation rates estimated by the International Monetary Fund.941\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 109-110.\n\n486.\n\nAlthough both approaches are similar, they show some differences and Fair Links criticizes Compass Lexecon's valuation on three points:942\n\ni. Compass Lexecon overestimated its variable costs by counting twice the so-called *\"Fondo ecodesarrollo regi\u00f3n amaz\u00f3nica\".*\n\nii. Compass Lexecon assesses variable costs on the basis of the Consortium's shares and inconsistently prorates fixed costs to Burlington's shares, i.e. 42.5% for Block 7 and 46.25% for Block 21, thus underestimating fixed costs.\n\niii. Compass Lexecon excludes the transportation costs deriving from the ship-or-pay commitments related to the OCP (*Oledoducto de Crudos Pesados*) pipeline from the Block 21 operating costs arguing that these are sunk costs as Burlington was contractually obliged to pay them until September 2018. According to Fair Links, \"[e]conomic and practical reality dictates that any willing buyer would have had to take on these costs in order to secure its transportation rights\", and accordingly considers that they should be taken into account in the valuation.943 Ecuador also argues that these costs should be included in the FMV computation, since Burlington did not provide any evidence that it committed to pay these costs until 2018, or that it indeed continued to pay such costs after leaving Ecuador.944\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 109.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 668.\n\n487.\n\nCompass Lexecon accepted Fair Links' critique on the first two points and adjusted its model accordingly.945 However, it rejected the third criticism in connection with the ship-or-pay charges associated with the OCP Pipeline. For Compass Lexecon, it is correct to exclude these costs from the DCF Model as Burlington had to incur them whether there was an expropriation or not.946 Fair Links disagrees and considers that not including the ship-or-pay costs is equivalent to saying that Burlington \"can export its crude from the Amazon to the Pacific for free\".947\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 61.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 4) (ENG), 1282:5-6 (Direct, de Feuardent).\n\n488.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Fair Links, which is why it instructed the experts to include OCP ship-or-pay costs in all scenarios considered in the Model.948\n\nPO29, \u00b6 8(d).\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the level of OPEX is necessarily linked to a given production profile. In their overview of the Model, the Parties' experts observed this dependence in the following terms:\n\n\"21. In paragraphs 8b, 8d, and 8e of PO 29, the Tribunal requested options concerning the production profile, operating expenses (OPEX), and capital expenses (CAPEX). We note that these three variables (production, OPEX and CAPEX) can only be applied jointly, based on whichever production scenario is chosen (RPS or Mr. Crick) since each production profile has corresponding costs and capital expenditures associated with their drilling plans and water production assumptions. The corresponding costs (OPEX and CAPEX) are therefore linked in the Joint Model to the chosen production profiles so as to avoid any inconsistent and incoherent economic results.\n\n22. The Joint Model therefore allows for the selection of Option 1) RPS production and its related costs; and Option 2) Mr. Crick production and its related costs; which can be selected in the Model Inputs section of the control panel labeled \u2018Production & Costs'\".949\n\nJoint Model Overview of 24 April 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n490.\n\nAs the Tribunal has chosen a modified version of Mr. Crick's production profile, the Tribunal will apply Compass Lexecon's OPEX calculations, which it understands are automatically updated in the Updated Model to adjust to the production chosen.\n\n**5.2.4 Capital expenditures (CAPEX) and depreciation**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nCompass Lexecon distinguishes two categories of CAPEX: (a) those related to the maintenance of existing wells and infrastructure and (b) those related to the development of additional wells, as forecasted by Mr. Crick.950\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 50.\n\n492.\n\nWith respect to (a), Compass Lexecon relies on historical CAPEX per gross barrel of production from 2007, adjusted for inflation.951\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n493.\n\nWith respect to (b), Compass Lexecon projects historical drilling costs at USD 5.29 million per well, times the number of incremental wells estimated by Mr. Crick (24 for Block 21, 21 for Block 7), for a total gross incremental CAPEX of USD 250.2 million over 26 months from November 2007 to December 2009.952 Compass Lexecon also includes ancillary CAPEX related to additional process capacity, power upgrades and water handling and treatment facilities estimated by Mr. Crick for a total of USD 92.7 million (USD 45.2 million for Block 7 and USD 47.5 million for Block 21).953\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 51.\n\n494.\n\nCompass Lexecon depreciates investments on a production per unit basis (\"capital costs are depreciated in a given period based on the amount of production in that period as a percentage of remaining production\").954\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 52.\n\n495.\n\nFair Links agrees with the categories of CAPEX used by Compass Lexecon, as well as with the depreciation methodology, but assumes no further drilling (as does RPS). Consequently, Fair Links recognizes the need for CAPEX to maintain existing wells,955 but does not include any CAPEX for additional wells.956\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 112, and ER3, \u00b6 112.\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6 114.\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the experts' agreement on the categories of CAPEX to be considered, as well as on the general methodology. It also notes that, as explained in paragraph 489 above, the experts agree that the CAPEX are dependent on the production profile adopted.957 As the Tribunal has chosen a modified version of Mr. Crick's production profile, it will apply Compass Lexecon's CAPEX projections, which are automatically adjusted in the Updated Model to correspond to the production profile chosen.\n\nJoint Valuation Model Overview of 24 April 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Fair Links had noted that if Compass Lexecon's CAPEX assumptions were applied in a scenario that reflected the impact of Law 42, the negative effect of the CAPEX would not be compensated by a higher production (Fair Links ER3, \u00b6 103). See also: Rejoinder, \u00b6 686.\n\n**5.2.5 Taxation**\n------------------\n\n497.\n\nBoth Parties' experts apply a 25% income tax and a 15% labor tax to the Consortium's taxable income (i.e. revenues net of both OPEX and depreciation), which results in an effective tax rate of 36.25%.958 Both experts' valuations are thus presented net of taxes.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 53, referring to: Block 7 PSC, Clause 11 (**Exh. C-1**) and Block 21 PSC, Clause 11 (**Exh. C-2**). The rate is calculated as follows: 1-(1-25%)\\*(1-15%) = 36.25%. See also: Fair Links ER2, \u00b6 121.\n\n498.\n\nHowever, because Fair Links considers the impact of Law 42 before arriving at the taxable income, it also applies Law 42 taxes to the Consortium's revenues, following a \"two-step evaluation\": (i) it \"first assesse[s] the extraordinary income derived from the difference between Oriente and Napo monthly prices adjusted for quality and the Reference Price adjusted for inflation\", and (ii) \"then applie[s] the 99% State participation on the extraordinary income \".959\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 120.\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that the economic effects of Law 42 must be ignored. Because reparation is due assuming that Ecuador would have complied with the PSC's and specifically with the tax absorption obligation, the 99% tax on extraordinary profits mandated by Law 42 must be disregarded. Had Ecuador complied with this obligation, the Consortium would have been compensated through the application of a correction factor that would have wiped out the effect of the Law 42 tax. As a result, the only taxes to be applied in the model are income and labor tax at a combined rate of 36.25%.\n\n**5.2.6 Sequence of variables in the DCF analysis**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n500.\n\nIn addition to objecting to the assumptions used by Compass Lexecon in its DCF valuation, Ecuador argues that Compass Lexecon calculates the FMV by misrepresenting the impact of various variables. Referring to Figure 1 of Compass Lexecon's Second Report,960 Ecuador alleges that Compass Lexecon \"considers the value drivers underlying a DCF valuation in a sequence that is not in keeping with how a DCF is built\".961 For Ecuador, Compass Lexecon considers taxation \u2013 Law 42 \u2013 before considering oil production and oil prices and thus does not show its full impact. Nor does Compass Lexecon show the full impact of applying an exaggerated 12.5% interest on cash flows until the date of the award; both Law 42 and interest should be considered \"at the end of the sequence once revenue (production and price) are determined \".962 Indeed, when these value drivers are analyzed in the correct order, so says Ecuador, \"it becomes clear that the key differences in the Parties' damages calculations are (i) the application of Law 42 (a USD 409 million impact) and (ii) Burlington's use of an exaggerated 12.5% actualization rate to calculate pre-judgment interest (a USD 366 million impact)\".963 By contrast, the other parameters (such as price, production, CAPEX, OPEX and discount rate) have a lesser impact.964\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, p. 12.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 576.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 577, referring to: Fair Links ER2, \u00b6 60.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 578.\n\n501.\n\nReviewing Fair Links' comments,965 as well as Figure 1 of Compass Lexecon's Second Report, it appears that Ecuador's objections are not directed at Compass Lexecon's DCF valuation, but at the reconciliation analysis that the latter offers to compare its valuation to Fair Links'. Figure 1, which is shown below, does not reproduce the sequence in which Compass Lexecon performs its DCF valuation; it shows the sequence in which Compass Lexecon has attempted to reconcile its damages calculation with Fair Links':966\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 51-66, 103.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, p. 12.\n\n502.\n\nFrom Fair Links' Third Report, it is evident that its objections relate to the sequence of the reconciliation, not of the DCF valuation. As Fair Links explains:\n\n\"In its second report, Compass Lexecon presents its reconciliation between our assessment of Burlington's assets value of $26.3 million (base case as of 30 August 2009) and its own assessment of $811.1 million (as of 15 September 2014). Starting from the $26.3 million value presented by Fair Links, Compass Lexecon adjusts this amount by successively incorporating in a specific order, which we consider inappropriate and even misleading, each parameter allegedly driving the difference between the experts. [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\n\n[\u2026] Several major issues arise from the logic of Compass Lexecon's analysis. In particular, the order of the parameters in the sequence proposed by Compass Lexecon misrepresents the impact of the differences between both experts\".967\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\n503.\n\nIn particular, Fair Links opines that \"[b]y placing the various operational parameters (prices, production, operating costs) at the end of the sequence, Compass Lexecon misrepresents the financial impact of Law 42 and Related Measures\".968 This is because Compass Lexecon's revenue and cost assumptions already reflect whether Law 42 is being considered or not (for instance, Compass Lexecon's revenue assumptions include all extraordinary revenues, production figures consider the drilling of new wells, and CAPEX include the cost of new drilling).969 As a consequence, Fair Links proposes the following adjusted reconciliation:970\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 54.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nFair Links ER3, Figure 13, p. 44 (reflecting the last step in Fair Links' reconciliation analysis).\n\n504.\n\nBy contrast, there appears to be no material controversy on the sequence of the DCF computation. The Tribunal understands that both experts compute free cash flows according to the following sequence: first, they establish revenues (determined by production volumes and prices) and subtract costs (OPEX, CAPEX (where relevant), and depreciation) to obtain taxable income, to which they then apply a 36.25% combined income and labor tax. The only difference regarding the sequence is that Fair Links applies Law 42 taxes to revenues, while Compass Lexecon does not.\n\n505.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no dispute on the sequence of the DCF valuation, but merely disputed variables, in particular, the applicability of Law 42 taxes, that Fair Links, but not Compass Lexecon, applies to revenues, and the impact of this choice on other assumptions (such as new drilling and CAPEX). Be this as it may, any possible disagreement between the experts regarding the sequence in which the different variables are to be computed in their DCF valuation has been put to rest by the Model, which reflects the valuation model (including the sequence) agreed by both experts, subject to various assumptions.\n\n**5.3 Computation of past and future cash flows**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nAs explained in Section VII.D.3.3 above, as the valuation is performed on 31 August 2016 as a proxy for the date of the award, the Tribunal must consider *past cash flows* (that would have accrued to Burlington from the date of the expropriation until the date of valuation as well as *future cash flows* (that would have accrued from the date of the valuation until the term of the PSC). Both sets of cash flows must be brought to present value: past cash flows must be brought forward through the application of an interest or actualization rate and future cash flows must be brought to present value through the application of a discount rate.\n\n507.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the discount rate applicable to future cash flows (4.3.2), and then the actualization rate applicable to past cash flows (4.3.3). Before turning to these points, it will address the situation of the pre-expropriation cash flows (4.3.1).\n\n**5.3.1 Pre-expropriation cash flows**\n--------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 288.iv above, Compass Lexecon calculates production from December 2007, the date on which the Consortium stopped drilling, allegedly as a result of the enactment of Law 42 at 99% and Ecuador's failure to comply with its tax absorption obligations.\n\n509.\n\nFor the reasons set out in paragraph 413 above, the Tribunal will not take into account cash flows that would have accrued before the expropriation. As a result, it will disregard any cash flows computed by Compass Lexecon before 30 August 2009.971\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Updated Model contains a functionality that allows the Tribunal to disregard these cash flows.\n\n**5.3.2 Discount rate applicable to future cash flows**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nThe Parties are generally in agreement with respect to the discount rate to apply to future cash flows: Compass Lexecon proposes a discount rate of 12.5%,972 while Fair Links endorses a 12% discount rate.973 According to Fair Links, the impact of this difference on the value of Burlington's assets is USD 0.6 million,974 while Compass Lexecon calculates it as less than 1%.975\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2 \u00b6 70. In its First Report, Compass Lexecon proposed a discount rate of 12.1% for a valuation date of 30 April 2013. Compass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 54.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 130.\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6 122.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 73.\n\n511.\n\nHowever, the experts disagree on the methodology to arrive at the discount rate; Compass Lexecon has calculated the Consortium's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) in accordance with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), a well-accepted method for the valuation of discount rates.976 Fair Links, by contrast, opines that \"the company's WACC should not be used in valuing an individual project due to its specific associated risk \".977 According to Fair Links, \"[t]his is key in the oil and gas industry where the higher expected return of successful projects offsets the sunk costs of unsuccessful exploration projects. This implies that the required discount rate (used to value a specific oil and gas asset) is not the business WACC, unless the risks associated to the specific asset are similar to those of the entire business \".978 In particular, in order to accurately reflect the capital structure of an oil and gas asset, Fair Links explains that it is \"essential to check the appropriateness of the standard industry WACC before using it to discount the future cash flows\" of that asset.979 In order to determine \"a discount rate that fairly reflects the return on Burlington's assets that could have been reasonably expected by an investor from Burlington's assets *but-for* expropriation\", Fair Links considers the following data: (i) the 12% discount rate used to assess Burlington's assets at the time when Perenco intended to purchase them in 2006; (ii) the 13.42% average rate of return of 56 oil and gas projects in 15 different countries derived from an IHS CERA study conducted in 2012, and (iii) the 9%-15% range of discount rates generally used in the upstream oil and gas industry.980\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 54 and Appendix B.\n\nFair Links ER2, \u00b6 126.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 127-128.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 129.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of Fair Links' objections to the use of the WACC as discount rate, but notes once more that the experts essentially agree with the use of a discount rate of 12% to 12.5% and that neither of them objects to using the discount rate proposed by the other. The Tribunal notes in particular that Fair Links accepts that this range is \"about quite the right level\".981 The Tribunal will therefore use Compass Lexecon's proposed 12.5%, which corresponds to the WACC, a widely-used parameter for discounting cash flows. It observes that Compass Lexecon's proposed rate is higher than Fair Links', thereby reducing future cash flows.\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 4) (ENG), 1275:12-13 (Direct, de Feuardent).\n\n513.\n\nFollowing this rationale, the Tribunal instructed the experts to use a 12.5% discount rate in their Model,982 which the experts did.983\n\nPO29, \u00b6 8(h).\n\nJoint Valuation Model, \u00b6 30(b).\n\n**5.3.3 Actualization rate applicable to past cash flows**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nBy contrast, the Parties fundamentally diverge on the actualization or interest rate to be applied to past cash flows (what Burlington also refers to as \"pre-award interest\").984 The Parties agree that the same principles apply to interest accruing on the amount awarded from the date of the award until payment (post-award interest).985 Therefore, the arguments and findings set out below apply as well to that element of Burlington's claim.\n\nSee, for instance: Mem. \u00b6 136 (\"In the circumstances of this case, Burlington is entitled to two forms of interest: pre-award interest, covering losses accruing up to the date of the Tribunal's final Award; and post-award interest on the full amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal until the date of payment. Pre-award interest is applied to losses that have been quantified prior to the Award date (i.e., prior to the date of valuation), in order to reflect the time value of money and to \"actualize\" the value of those losses. Post-award interest, on the other hand, is applied to the entire sum of damages awarded by the Tribunal to ensure that Burlington is not harmed further by delay in the payment of the Award\").\n\nReply, \u00b6 240; Rejoinder, \u00b6 605.\n\n**a. Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n515.\n\nBurlington contends that compensation for delayed payment (i.e., interest) is an integral component of full reparation under customary international law. According to Burlington, a State's duty to make full reparation arises immediately after the unlawful act has caused harm. If that payment is delayed, the claimant loses the opportunity to use the funds for productive ends, and thus payment must be subject to interest. For Burlington, the interest rate must be equivalent to the opportunity cost to it of having been deprived of the funds in question, and in Burlington's submission this opportunity cost is equivalent to its WACC.986 Burlington asserts that it \"was deprived of the periodic dividends (profits) generated by the Blocks, and was instead, *de facto*, forced to reinvest those funds into the fields (i.e., its dividends could not be \"cashed-out\" of the Blocks)\".987 As a result, say Burlington and its expert, \"the interest rate on the foregone dividends must be equivalent to the return that Burlington reasonably expected to earn from its investment in the Blocks\u2014i.e., the projects' cost of capital (WACC) \".988 Burlington submits that this approach has been endorsed by both scholars989 and tribunals.990\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 134-144; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 227-241.\n\nReply, \u00b6 230.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nBurlington relies, *inter alia*, on: T.

Argentina\"),* Award of 22 May 2014, \u00b6 429 (**Exh. CL-372**).\n\n516.\n\nCompass Lexecon explains in this respect that \"to grant Burlington full compensation for its losses, damages accruing prior to the date of valuation need to be actualized to the date of valuation at a risk-adjusted rate that compensates [Burlington] for the opportunity cost of capital of doing business in the industry. This is because in the absence of Ecuador's measures, Burlington would still be in business as of the date of award \".991 In Compass Lexecon's view, the appropriate actualization rate is the WACC, which is the same rate that is used to discount future cash flows, in this case 12.5%, because \"it reflects the return expected by an investor when investing in assets with a similar risk profile \".992\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 80.\n\n*Ibid.* See also: Compass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 54.\n\n517.\n\nBurlington and its expert object to Ecuador's use of LIBOR plus two percent as an actualization rate on three grounds:\n\ni. First, it asserts that \"if the \u2018post-expropriation interest' rate is to serve as a measure of the cost of debt for a firm or industry, it should be applied on a pretax basis, not on an after-tax basis\", \"because the risk embedded in any debt agreement is reflected in the pre-tax interest rate\".993\n\nii. Second, it states that LIBOR \"is no longer a representative measure of short term borrowing costs since there has been evidence of manipulation of the Libor\".994\n\niii. Finally, Compass Lexecon \"disagree[s] with the notion that, to determine the full compensation as of a date of the award, one must treat Burlington as if it was relieved from industry risk at the time of Ecuador's expropriation\".995 While Compass Lexecon acknowledges that this is valid for the actual scenario, it maintains that it is not so in the but for scenario, because \"[a]bsent Ecuador's measures, it must be assumed that Burlington would have kept operating in Ecuador\".996 Compass Lexecon therefore rejects the application of a risk-free pre-award interest rate endorsed by Ecuador, noting that the paper by Fisher and Romaine on which Ecuador relies has been criticized for ignoring the defendant's cost of borrowing.997\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 84.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 85.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 86.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 87, referring to: F. M. Fisher & R. C. Romaine, \"Janis Joplin's Yearbook and the Theory of Damages\", *Journal of Accounting, Auditing & Finance*, Volume 5, No. 1 (Winter 1990), pp. 147-148 (**Exh. CLEX-65**) and R. L.

CLEX-55**).\n\n518.\n\nAlternatively, Compass Lexecon proposes to apply the \"coerced loan theory\", under which \"the State's failure or delay in paying compensation for expropriated assets is recognized as effectively a free loan to the State\", which Ecuador must then repay with interest on the date of the award.998 This interest should be the one that Ecuador would pay any other lender, namely \"at a rate equivalent to Ecuador's external cost of debt financing from private lenders\".999 On this basis, Compass Lexecon proposes to apply Ecuador's long-term cost of debt, whose 1-year average is 7.9%.1000 According to Compass Lexecon, if Ecuador should pay less than its cost of debt, \"it would be as if Ecuador had obtained a below market rate loan from Burlington at the time of expropriation\", and \"would thereby benefit economically from what the Tribunal has found to have been an unlawful expropriation\".1001 Compass Lexecon emphasizes that the coerced loan theory undercompensates Burlington, but if an alternative actualization rate were used, it would have to be \"at least equal to or greater than Ecuador's cost of lending1002 during the corresponding update period\".1003\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 90.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 91.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the expert means cost of borrowing.\n\nCompass Lexecon ER2, \u00b6 93.\n\n519.\n\nFor Burlington, an award of interest should accrue on a compound basis.1004 Burlington notes that many investment tribunals have found that this is the best way to give effect to the principle of full reparation, and that compound interest reflects economic reality in modern times.1005 According to Burlington, Ecuador recognizes the appropriateness of compounding, as it seeks compound interest on its claims against Burlington.1006 Burlington thus requests that \"[a]ll interest awarded to Burlington should thus be subject to reasonable compounding\", noting that \"[t]he appropriate periodicity of the compounding is annual, since the WACC is calculated on the basis of annual expected returns\".1007\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 143-144; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 242-247.\n\nMem., \u00b6 143 and Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 242-243, citing: *Occidental v.

Per international and Ecuadorian law, the appropriate post-expropriation interest rate should be equivalent to LIBOR plus a reasonable commercial spread of 2%\".1009\n\nCM, \u00b6 541.\n\n522.\n\nEcuador contends that using the WACC as interest rate, as opposed to using it as discount rate, leads to overcompensation.1010 According to Ecuador, Burlington adopts a higher discount rate than Ecuador to discount future cash flows for purely strategic reasons, since it wishes to apply that same rate to its past lost profits where the impact is much greater.1011 Indeed, with an interest rate of 12.5% on past lost profits, Burlington adds USD 366 million (out of USD 632.6 million) in interest, representing 58% of the total past lost profits claim.1012 As a result, Burlington's lost profits claim is \"mostly a claim for pre-judgment interest at the exaggerated rate of 12.5%\".1013\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 594, 600-602.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 599.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 600.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 601.\n\n523.\n\nEcuador further argues that the use of the WACC as an actualization rate (or postexpropriation interest rate, as Fair Links calls it) is particularly inappropriate because the WACC includes a premium or \"reward\" for risk, when Burlington no longer bore any risk having ceased operations.1014 As Fair Links stresses, the damage related to the expropriation would be actualized \"with a full industrial risk\" between the date of the expropriation and the date of valuation, when in fact (i) Burlington \"was relieved from the industrial risk related to the assets in August 2009\", and (ii) \"[i]n any case (and Compass Lexecon is surprisingly silent about that), the Participation Contract of Block 7 (the most important and profitable Block operated by the Consortium in Ecuador) and the related risk were to come to an end in August 2010\".1015\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 594, referring to: Fair Links ER3, \u00b6 54.\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6 129.\n\n524.\n\nEcuador further specifies that the WACC could only be used as an actualization rate for lost profits accruing before 30 August 2009, for a time when Burlington was exposed to industry risk in Ecuador (assuming, *quod non*, that Burlington could claim for any pre-expropriation lost profits). Thereafter, only an interest rate consistent with the Treaty should be applied.1016\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 600.\n\n525.\n\nIn this respect, Ecuador submits that Article III(1) of the Treaty requires the application of a commercially reasonable pre- (and post-) award interest rate.1017 According to Ecuador, \"[t]he ordinary meaning of \u2018 *interest at a commercially reasonable rate* ' is one that is available to companies in the market and remunerates the time value of money \".1018 In Burlington's case, this requires a rate that \"reasonably reflects the after-tax cost of debt commercially available to U.S. oil and gas companies for dollar borrowings\".1019 Relying on Fair Links' understanding of industry practice, Ecuador submits that the appropriate interest rate is LIBOR plus two percent, with an average yield of 2.33%.1020\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 602, 603-628.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 612 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 612-628. The Tribunal notes that Fair Links proposes the use of LIBOR + 2 for 3-month borrowing. See: Fair Links ER2, **Exh. 9**.\n\n526.\n\nEcuador contends that the use of LIBOR plus an appropriate margin has been cited as an example of a commercially reasonable rate in other BITs signed by the United States.1021 In addition, several investment tribunals have applied LIBOR plus two percent as an interest rate for purposes of treaties based on the U.S. Model BIT,1022 as have other tribunals based on other treaties.1023 Commentators have recognized that LIBOR plus two percent is a commonly-used interest rate.1024\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 614, referring to: Article III, Treaty between the United States of America and Ukraine concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (1994) (**Exh.

First, Ecuador contends that \"computing post-expropriation interest on a pre-tax basis is inconsistent with the determination of the other damage components on an after-tax basis and at odds with the full compensation principle\", because \"[n]o matter how Burlington would have used the funds received as compensation to generate revenues, it would have had to pay taxes\".1025 As explained by Fair Links, by computing interest on a pre-tax basis, \"Compass Lexecon chooses to ignore one of the basic rules of business valuation according to which an asset appraised on an after-tax basis is to be consistently discounted through an after-tax actualisation rate\".1026\n\nii. Second, Fair Links explains that, regardless of the LIBOR \"scandal\", LIBOR remains a valid interest rate.1027\n\niii. Third, \"were post-expropriation interest to reflect the industrial risk borne by Burlington in a \u2018but for' scenario (represented by a 12.5% WACC according to Compass Lexecon), compensation would be determined on the basis of a theoretical risk, instead of the actual risk borne by Burlington\".1028\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 624.\n\nFair Links ER3, \u00b6 143.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 626.\n\n528.\n\nAs a result, Ecuador argues that Burlington's 12.5% pre-judgment interest rate must be discarded,1029 as must its alternative case of a 7.9% borrowing rate.1030 If the Tribunal were to reject the use of LIBOR plus two percent, Ecuador proposes as an alternative that the Tribunal should apply one of the other commercially reasonable rates applicable to the oil and gas industry proposed by Fair Links, i.e. (i) ConocoPhillips' after-tax cost of debt calculated over the 2009-2013 financial years (estimated at 2.11%), or (ii) the US prime rate (3.25%), which, to Ecuador, is equivalent to the \"cost incurred by a claimant party to borrow an amount equivalent to the potential compensation of which they were deprived on the US financial markets\".1031\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 602, 629-645.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 602, 646-659.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 628.\n\n529.\n\nAs regards compound *versus* simple interest, Ecuador submits that both customary international law and Ecuadorian law require that any award of interest should accrue on a simple interest basis.1032 Ecuador argues that this is the position reflected in the commentaries to the ILC Articles,1033 as well as the position adopted by several arbitral tribunals.1034 Ecuador denies that there is a trend towards the application of compound interest, and submits that compound interest should only be awarded when it is appropriate in the circumstances, which is not the case here.1035\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 559-563; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 911- 917.\n\nCM, \u00b6 560, citing: the ILC Articles, Part Two, p. 108, point (8) (**Exh.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n531.\n\nAs it has already anticipated, a majority of the Tribunal agrees with Burlington that past cash flows must be brought to present value through the application of an actualization or interest rate. This is a consequence of the principle of full reparation: in order to make Burlington whole, cash flows that would have accrued between the date of the expropriation and the date of valuation must be actualized on the date of the valuation in order to reflect the time value of money.\n\n532.\n\nThat being said, the Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the WACC is not necessarily the appropriate actualization rate for this purpose. The WACC contains an element of cost of capital that allows cash flows to reflect the time value of money, but it also includes a reward for all the risks involved in doing business. The WACC is thus appropriate to discount *future* cash flows, because these flows are adjusted to reflect the time value of money (i.e., that 100 dollars in the future are worth less today) and to reflect the risks of doing business due to the fact that the operator's profit-making capacity is not certain.\n\n533.\n\nBy contrast, using the WACC as an actualization rate for *past* cash flows could overcompensate Burlington. While the WACC contains an element of cost of capital that would allow past cash flows to reflect the time value of money (i.e., that 100 dollars in the past are worth more today), it also contains an element of reward for risk that is inappropriate here because Burlington no longer bears the risk of operation. As Fisher and Romaine conclude in the paper quoted below, a claimant is entitled to interest compensating for the time value of money, but not for risk:\n\n\"The violation took place at a single point of time, time 0. It involved the destruction of an asset whose value at that time is clearly known as Y. Hence, had damages been assessed at time 0, an award of Y would have made the plaintiff whole. Unfortunately, however, the processes of justice take time, and the award is to be made at time t > 0. How (if at all) should the plaintiff be compensated for this fact?\n\nAt first glance, it may seem that the plaintiff is entitled to interest at its opportunity cost of capital, r. After all, had the plaintiff received Y at time 0, it would have invested the funds, receiving presumably its average rate of return. Hence, by time t, the plaintiff would have had Yert, so this is the amount that would make it whole. Another version of this argument would compensate the plaintiff at the rate it reasonably expected to earn on the destroyed asset.\n\nThe fallacy here (in either version) has to do with risk. The plaintiff's opportunity cost of capital includes a return that compensates the plaintiff for the average risk it bears. But, in depriving the plaintiff of an asset worth Y at time 0, the defendant also relieved it of the risks associated with investment in that asset. The plaintiff is thus entitled to interest compensating it for the time value of money, but it is not also entitled to compensation for the risks it did not bear. Hence prejudgment interest should be awarded at the risk-free interest rate, r\\* < r\".1039\n\nF. M. Fisher and R. C. Romaine, \"Janis Joplin's Yearbook and the Theory of Damages\", *Journal of Accounting Auditing & Finance,* Volume 5, No. 1 (Winter 1990), p. 146 (**Exh. EL-291**).\n\n534.\n\nThis was also the approach taken by Perenco's expert, Prof. Kalt also of Compass Lexecon, in connection with Perenco's claim for past cash flows against Ecuador. After explaining that future cash flows must be discounted at the WACC, Dr. Kalt refers to the actualization of past cash flows as follows:\n\n\"[P]ast amounts (such as revenue from additional wells that Perenco would have drilled) that would have accrued to Perenco prior to the date of valuation but for Ecuador's unlawful actions must also be accounted for and brought forward to December 1, 2014 in order to reflect the time value of money between when those damages were incurred and the date of valuation. If Perenco is to be kept economically whole, the amount of the final damages awarded should reflect the foregone value of not having access to that money for the period between when the amounts accrue and the evaluation date.\n\nUnlike the discount rate used to discount the stream of future cash flows discussed above, which must be high enough to compensate for the level of non-diversifiable project-related risk, the rate used to compensate Perenco for the time value of these monies is lower. This reflects the fact that, while Perenco is forgoing the time value of money on any damages award while waiting for such an award, the award amount is not being invested by Perenco in any risky endeavour that would require compensation for risk. Accordingly, the interest factor to be applied to the historical period up to the date of actual payment of damages to Perenco is a relatively low and riskfree rate of interest\".1040\n\nExpert Report on Quantum of Joseph P. Kalt dated 19 December 2014, in the case of *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, \u00b6\u00b6 126127, (**Exh. EL-399**).\n\n535.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this is the correct approach here. The Tribunal will thus apply a reasonable risk-free commercial rate. Ecuador has proposed LIBOR plus two percent for three month borrowings, and the Tribunal agrees. The Tribunal also notes that this has been the rate used by many investment tribunals in recent years.1041\n\nSee, for instance: *Lemire v. Ukraine,* Award of 28 March 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 352 and 356 (**Exh. EL-279**) ; *PSEG Global, v. Turkey,* Award of 19 January 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 345-348 (**Exh. CL-96**) ; *Sempra v. Argentina,* Award of 28 September 2007, \u00b6 486 (**Exh. CL-80**) ; *Enron v. Argentina,* Award of 22 May 2007, \u00b6 452 (**Exh. CL-81**) ; *Continental Casualty v. Argentina,* Award of 5 September 2008, \u00b6 314 (**Exh. EL-74**) ; *El Paso v. Argentina,* Award of 31 October 2011, \u00b6 745 (**Exh. CL-249**) ; *National Grid v. Argentina Republic,* Award of 3 November 2008, \u00b6 294 (**Exh. CL-251**) ; *RDC v. Guatemala,* Award of 29 June 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 278-279 (**Exh. EL-293**) ; *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,* Award of 29 July 2008, \u00b6 769 (**Exh. CL-158**).\n\n536.\n\nHaving selected the applicable rate, the Tribunal must decide whether interest must be compounded or not. For that, it must first determine the law governing this issue, namely whether it is Ecuadorian or international law. At paragraphs 177 to 179 of the Decision on Liability and as reiterated in paragraph 44 above, the Tribunal has concluded that it will apply (i) first and foremost the BIT and, if need be, (ii) Ecuadorian law and those rules of international law \"as may be applicable\". It further clarified that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law, being understood that a party may not rely on its internal law to avoid an obligation under international law.\n\n537.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not appropriate to apply national law to the issue of compound interest. The application of national law may be appropriate for contract claims, but not for a claim of a breach of the BIT such as the present claim. The responsibility of a State arising from an unlawful expropriation is governed by international law, triggering the State's obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused, including compensation for the time value of money. As a result, whether interest should be simple or compounded is a matter to be addressed under international l aw.1042\n\nSee also, for instance: *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Award of 16 September 2015, \u00b6 520.\n\n538.\n\nThe cases cited by the Parties support this conclusion. In three of the cases cited by Ecuador, *Desert Line v. Yemen*, *Aucoven v. Venezuela* and *Duke Energy v. Ecuador,* the application of interest related to damages arising from contract claims. As a result, both in *Aucoven* and *Duke Energy*, the tribunals found that it was appropriate to apply national law to the question of compound interest, and thus favored the award of simple interest.1043 In *Duke Energy*, the tribunal specifically noted that \"compound interest may be awarded for expropriation but not for contract claims\".1044 Other arbitral tribunals have also distinguished between disputes arising from treaty breaches and those arising from contract breaches.1045\n\n*Aucoven v. Venezuela,* Award of 23 September 2003, \u00b6\u00b6 105, 394-395 (**Exh. EL-295**) and *Duke v. Ecuador,* Award of 18 August 2008, \u00b6 457 (**Exh\" CL-41**). In *Desert Line,* the tribunal provided no reason for its decision to award simple interest. See: *Desert Line v. Yemen,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award of 6 February 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 294-295 (**Exh. EL-294**).\n\n*Duke Energy v. Ecuador,* Award of 18 August 2008, \u00b6 432 (**Exh. CL-41**).\n\nSee, for instance: *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica,* Award of 17 February 2000, \u00b6 97 (**Exh. CL-** **175**).\n\n539.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus apply international law to determine whether interest must be simple or compounded. In the Tribunal's view, this question must be answered by reference to the standard of compensation. As this standard is the customary international law principle of full reparation, the interest awarded should aim to fully repair the time value of money lost by the fact that Burlington was deprived of cash flows due to it. Compound interest, which has become the standard to remunerate the use of money in modern finance, comes closer to achieving this purpose than simple interest. Indeed, being deprived of the use of the money to which it was entitled, a creditor may have to borrow funds or may forego investments, for which it would pay or earn compound interest. As noted in *Continental Casualty* :\n\n\"[C]ompound interest reflects economic reality in modern times, and the hesitation may be directed more at extreme rates [\u2026] rather than compound interest in principle. The time value of money in free market economies is measured in compound interest; simple interest cannot be relied upon to produce full reparation for a claimant's loss occasioned by delay in payment; and under many national laws recently enacted, an arbitration tribunal is now expressly empowered to award compound interest\".1046\n\n*Continental Casualty v. Argentina,* \u00b6 309, Award of 5 September 2008 (**Exh. CL-270**).\n\n540.\n\nEcuador has pointed out that, according to the Commentary to ILC Article 38, \"[t]he general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest\".1047 Given the recent developments in international investment law, the Tribunal cannot agree. As noted in *Occidental II*, while \"[t]he traditional norm was to award simple interest [\u2026] this practice has changed and, in fact, most recent awards provide for compound interest\".1048 Indeed, a significant number of arbitral tribunals have adopted the view that compound interest achieves full reparation better than simple interest.1049 This Tribunal is of the same view, and will thus award compound interest.\n\nCommentary to ILC Article 38, \u00b6 8.\n\n*Occidental v. Ecuador II,* Award of 5 October 2012, \u00b6 840 (**Exh. CL-240**).\n\nSee, for instance: *Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, Award of 5 September 2008, \u00b6 313 (**Exh. CL-270**) (finding that \"full reparation to Continental should include compound interest on the compensation due from but unpaid by Argentina\"), and *Occidental v. Ecuador II,* Award of 5 October 2012, \u00b6 840 (**Exh. CL-240**) (holding that awarding compound interest \"accords with the *Chorz\u00f4w* principle as an award of compound interest will usually reflect the actual damages suffered\"). See also: *El Paso v. Argentina*, Award of 31 October 2011, \u00b6 745; *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, Award of 20 August 2007, \u00b6 9.2.6; *Wena v. Egypt*, Award of 8 December 2000, \u00b6 129.\n\n541.\n\nBurlington has submitted that compounding should be carried out on a yearly basis, which the Tribunal considers reasonable.\n\n542.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, past cash flows (i.e., cash flows accrued from the date of the expropriation to the date of valuation., i.e. 31 August 2016) will be actualized at a rate of LIBOR plus two percent from the date on which they should have accrued and until 31 August 2016, compounded on an annual basis. This actualization rate has been applied by the Tribunal to all past cash flows through the Updated Model. It is thus already included in the damage amount computed through the model.\n\n**5.3.4 Computation of lost cash flows**\n----------------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nHaving applied the assumptions set out above to the Updated Model, Burlington's lost profits are quantified at USD 383,041,068 on a 31 August 2016 date of valuation. As anticipated in Section VII.D.5.2.1 above, to account for the deferral of new drilling in Block 21, the Tribunal will subtract the part of the cash flows that can be attributed to new wells in the last 1.5 years of operation of Block 21, i.e. from January 2020 to June 2021. The Tribunal has calculated that 15% of these cash flows could have been attributed to new wells, for a total of USD 3,238,801. As a result, the Tribunal quantifies Burlington's lost profits at **USD 379,802,267**.\n\n**6. Burlington's claim that the Award be protected against taxation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nBurlington notes that it has calculated its damages net of Ecuadorian tax. As a result, \"any taxation by Ecuador of the Award would result in Burlington being effectively taxed twice for the same income\".1050 Citing *ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA*, Burlington argues that this would undermine the principle of full reparation.1051\n\nMem., \u00b6 145.\n\n*Ibid.*, citing: *Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited & ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v. Petroleos de Venezuela*, S.A., ICC Case No.16848/JRF/CA (C-16849/JRF), Award of 17 September 2012, \u00b6 313 (**Exh. CL-275**).\n\n545.\n\nAs a result, Burlington requests the Tribunal to declare that:\n\ni. \"The Award is net of all applicable Ecuadorian taxes\";\n\nii. \"Ecuador may not tax or attempt to tax the Award\"; and\n\niii. \"Burlington has no further taxation obligations to Ecuador\".1052\n\nMem., \u00b6 146.\n\n546.\n\nEcuador does not engage with this claim, but it appears to accept that Burlington's damages are calculated net of taxes (indeed, both Parties' experts' calculate net cash flows after the application of Ecuadorian income tax and labor participation tax).1053\n\nCompass Lexecon ER1, \u00b6 53; CM, \u00b6 494; Fair Links ER2, \u00b6 121.\n\n547.\n\nIt is undisputed that the cash flows have been computed net of income and labor participation tax. As a result, the Tribunal agrees that the amounts awarded to Burlington in this Award are net of income and labor participation taxes, and that Ecuador may not impose or attempt to impose these taxes on the Award. By contrast, the Tribunal is unable on the record before it to make a general declaration about \"all taxes\", as Burlington has not sufficiently substantiated this request.\n\n**E.

Admitting *arguendo* that Ecuador has unlawfully expropriated Burlington's investment, this does not preclude a finding of contributory negligence.1060 Nor is this principle limited to cases in which the claimant's behavior was unlawful or prohibited; it also applies when it was merely imprudent. Finally, all 11 cases cited by Ecuador support the proposition that contributory negligence must be factored in the calculation of compensation.1061\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 823, 844-845.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 826-830.\n\n**1.2 As a matter of fact, Burlington materially contributed to its own losses**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nEcuador alleges that Burlington's behavior broke the chain of causation or at least significantly contributed to the losses.1062 It argues that \"Burlington took a number of willful, reckless, or negligent steps that exposed it to a serious risk that Ecuador would intervene in Blocks 7 and 21, setting aside whether or not such intervention was appropriate under the circumstances (which it was)\".1063 Specifically, Ecuador asserts that, if Burlington had paid its mandatory Law 42 dues and not suspended operations1064(Section 1.2.1 below), or not impeded the Consortium's negotiations with Ecuador1065 (Section 1.2.2 below), Ecuador would not have been forced to take over Blocks 7 and 21. In any event, if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over Burlington's claim for past Law 42 dues, Burlington's behavior during the *coactiva* proceedings prevents compensation for the market value of the oil seized (Section 1.2.3 below).\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 510-534.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 511.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 513-528.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 529-533.\n\n**1.2.1 Burlington contributed to its own losses by ceasing to pay Law 42 dues and suspending operations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nEcuador argues that the Tribunal \"cannot overlook the cause-effect relationship between Burlington's failure to pay its Law 42 dues, the *coactiva* process, the abandonment of the Blocks and the declaration of *caducidad*. Had Burlington paid its Law 42 dues, the Consortium would have continued to operate the Blocks and the present Arbitral Tribunal, the jurisdiction of which is limited to alleged Treaty breaches, would not be considering Burlington's compensation\".1066 When Burlington ceased paying the Law 42 dues, \"it manufactured a crisis which [\u2026] was entirely unnecessary\".1067 Burlington knew or should have known that ceasing to pay Law 42 dues would force Ecuador to commence *coactiva* proceedings against it. It should also have known that the \"inevitable consequence\" of deciding to suspend operations would be State intervention, given the State's constitutional duty to ensure the continuity of oil operations and the risk of damage that the suspension entailed.1068 Ecuador was thus left with no choice but to intervene. Even if the Tribunal does not reconsider its decision that the intervention constituted an expropriation, \"it should at the very least take into account the recently disclosed evidence to hold that Burlington's behavior was a contributory cause of its loss\".1069\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 514.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 519.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 525.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n554.\n\nContrary to its contentions, Burlington had no justification to cease paying the Law 42 dues. First, the Tribunal refused to find that Law 42 was expropriatory and that the expropriation had been carried out in a manner that was unfair, inequitable, arbitrary or in contravention of Ecuador's obligations. As a result, Ecuador's application of Law 42 to Burlington was not an internationally wrongful act. Even if it had been a contractually wrongful act, Burlington could not rely on it because the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over contract claims. In any event, Ecuador's contractual breach did not substantially deprive the contract of value.1070\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 514-518; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 835-838, 849-862.\n\n555.\n\nSecond, the payment of taxes is a mandatory legal obligation. Like the claimants in *Micula*, Burlington exposed itself to the consequences of failing to comply with a legal obligation.1071\n\nCM, \u00b6 526; Rejoinder, \u00b6 839.\n\n556.\n\nThird, Burlington cannot argue that its failure to pay the Law 42 dues was justified by the Tribunal's recommendation of provisional measures in PO1, which is dated 1 June 2009, when Burlington stopped its payments one year earlier. In any event, the Tribunal's recommendation in PO1 is not binding on Ecuador. Moreover, that order was rendered on the Tribunal's *prima facie* acquaintance with the case, and was superseded by the Decision on Liability, which held that neither Law 42 nor the *coactiva* measures were expropriatory.1072\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 839-840.\n\n557.\n\nFourth, the Consortium was negligent in not submitting to Ecuador an economic analysis demonstrating that Law 42 had affected the economy of the PSCs. While the Tribunal refused to find that the Consortium's \"pledge\" to submit these figures was a condition precedent, it remains that the Consortium breached this pledge and acted negligently.1073\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 846-848.\n\n558.\n\nEcuador also denies that Burlington's decision to suspend operations in the Blocks was justified.1074 Ecuador has invited the Tribunal to reconsider its findings on these facts in its Motion for Reconsideration, but \"[e]ven accepting, *quod non*, that Ecuador's intervention in Blocks 7 and 21 constituted an expropriation, the manner in which the Consortium proceeded to first threaten to and then suspend its operations, and the fact that it did not resume operations after having been invited by Ecuador to do so clearly contributed to its losses\".1075 Even if Burlington had the right to suspend operations (which Ecuador denies), Burlington had the obligation to exercise that right prudently, which it failed to do. Relying on RPS's expert opinion, Ecuador contends that \"Burlington's threatened suspension created four significant types of risk for Blocks 7 and 21: (i) reservoir damage; (ii) mechanical damage; (iii) environmental damage; and (iv) economic loss\".1076 The newly disclosed Suspension Plan shows that Burlington was aware of these risks and of the risk that Ecuador would intervene. Burlington nonetheless proceeded with the suspension and failed to resume operations in \"reckless disregard\" of these risks.1077 This decision was \"fully disproportionate in the circumstances\" because it meant \"putting the entire operation underlying the [PSCs] at risk\". It was also taken \"in blatant disregard of the Consortium's obligation to first seek the Tribunal's permission to suspend operations\".1078 The only explanation for Burlington's decision to abandon the Blocks was that it was part of Burlington's \"cynical self-expropriation, exit strategy\".1079\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 849-862.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 849.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 851, citing: RPS ER1, \u00b6 30.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 853.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 854.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 861, citing: email from A.

Ecuador argues that Burlington's conduct is \"far more reprehensible\" than the behavior that other tribunals have considered. As in *Micula*, the Tribunal should hold that Burlington's failure to comply with its tax obligations excludes Ecuador's liability. Alternatively, it should hold that such failure was a bad or imprudent business decision as in *Enron, MTD, Azurix, RosInvestCo, Anatolie Stati,* and *Goetz*.1080\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 863-870.\n\n**1.2.2 Burlington contributed to its own losses by boycotting negotiations with the state**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nFor Ecuador, consistent with practice and international law, Burlington had a good faith duty to negotiate with the State when oil prices increased. This duty arises from the principle of good faith and trade usages, which Burlington itself invokes in connection with the extension of Block 7. Burlington cannot argue that there is a global practice to renegotiate contracts to extend their term (*quod non*) and deny at the same time that there is a practice to renegotiate contracts in light of changed circumstances. Similarly, Burlington had a duty not to withdraw from the negotiations.1081\n\nCM, \u00b6 529 and Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 875-881, 888-891, citing: Fair Links ER1, \u00b6 6, *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v.

But for Burlington's boycott, the Consortium would have continued operating the Blocks and would have entered into service contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 with Ecuador, \"and this case would be over\".1082 Rather than negotiating in good faith, says Ecuador, Burlington remained focused on its self-expropriation exit strategy. It in particular refused to sign the Draft Transitory Agreements negotiated by Perenco and threatened Perenco against entering them. Burlington also wrongfully terminated negotiations after Perenco had executed the March and October Transitory Agreements. While the former contained reservations of rights, the latter did not and were duly executed.1083\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 834.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 530-532, referring to: **Exhs.

Burlington's position**\n----------------------------\n\n565.\n\nBurlington denies that it contributed to its own losses and submits that it was entitled to insist on its rights throughout the course of the dispute giving rise to this arbitration.\n\n566.\n\nWhile Burlington recognizes that compensation may be reduced if a victim contributed to its own loss, it argues that Ecuador misapplies the principle of contributory fault. According to the Claimant, \"[t]here is no authority for Ecuador's extraordinary view that compensation should be reduced to punish Burlington for *lawful* conduct in defense of its *lawful* rights against Ecuador's *unlawful* conduct\".1090 None of the 11 cases cited by Ecuador supports this contention.1091\n\nReply, \u00b6 259.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 250. Burlington alleges that, of the 11 cases, 4 discussed contributory fault but rejected it; 3 reduced damages because the investor had left itself legally unprotected against certain risks or had overpaid for its investment; 3 involved illegal conduct by the investor; and 1 dismissed all claims because of the investor's wrongful conduct.\n\n567.\n\nOn the facts, Burlington denies having engaged in any wrongful conduct that could justify a reduction of the compensation owed to it. Burlington's decisions to pay Law 42 amounts into a segregated account (i) and suspend operations (ii) were fully justified, and Burlington behaved reasonably and in good faith during its negotiations with Ecuador (iii).\n\n568.\n\nIn respect of (i), Burlington rejects the argument that it \"manufacture[d] a crisis\". It was Ecuador who failed to comply with the PSCs, violated the Tribunal's order, and ultimately its own law.1092 In particular, it was Ecuador's refusal to establish an escrow account for the payment of Law 42 taxes and to discontinue the *coactiva* proceedings in violation of the Tribunal's order that escalated the dispute.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 251.\n\n569.\n\nIn connection with (ii), while Ecuador recognizes Burlington's right to suspend production, it wrongly argues that Burlington failed to exercise that right prudently.1093 The Tribunal already held that Burlington could suspend operations for up to 30 days regardless of just cause and that there would have been just cause if Burlington had suspended for a longer period.1094 In addition, stresses Burlington, the Tribunal was not \"persuaded that the suspension posed such a significant risk of damage as to justify Ecuador's immediate intervention\".1095 Indeed, Burlington has established that there was no material risk of harm \"in suspending operations in the manner in which the Consortium intended\".1096 In any event, Ecuador's argument that \"Burlington should be held contributorily negligent because the good faith, justified exercise of its rights provoked a breach of domestic and international law by Ecuador\" is absurd and unsupported by authority.1097\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 254.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 255, referring to: DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 513, 517.\n\nReply, \u00b6 255, referring to: DoL, \u00b6 519.\n\nReply, \u00b6 255.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 256.\n\n570.\n\nWith respect to (iii), the Claimant opposes Ecuador's theory that Burlington contributed to its losses by boycotting negotiations. Contrary to what Ecuador contends, it had no obligation to renegotiate due to increasing oil prices. The Tribunal already held that the PSCs exposed Burlington to \"full upside price risk\".1098 Accordingly, \"[i]t was not Burlington's obligation to renegotiate the PSCs, but rather Ecuador's obligation to apply a correction factor to the PSCs to absorb the effects of Law 42\".1099 In any event, Burlington did not boycott negotiations with the Government. Mr. Martinez confirmed that Burlington had negotiated in good faith attending all meetings to the extent permitted.1100 Ultimately, it was simply unable to accept Ecuador's proposals \"because they were unreasonable and required Burlington to relinquish its rights under the PSCs without even knowing what rights it would obtain in return\".1101\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 258, referring to: DoL, \u00b6 281.\n\nReply, \u00b6 259.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 260, referring to: Tr.

Ecuador ignores the principles underlying a \"but for\" analysis: had Ecuador complied with its obligations under the contracts and international law, no *coactiva* auctions would have taken place and the Consortium would have sold its oil in the normal course of business at market price. Burlington must thus be compensated for that lost production at market price.1102\n\nReply, \u00b6 261.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n572.\n\nIt is undisputed that a claimant's conduct may justify an exclusion or reduction of damages if it has contributed to the injury. Article 39 of the ILC Articles expressly provides:\n\n\" **Article 39. Contribution to the injury**\n\nIn the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.\"\n\n573.\n\nThe Commentary to Article 39 goes on to explain that this provision \"deals with the situation where damage has been caused by an internationally wrongful act of a State, which is accordingly responsible for the damage in accordance with articles 1 and 28, but where the injured State, or the individual victim of the breach, has materially contributed to the damage by some wilful or negligent act or omission\".1103 This provision also \"recognizes that the conduct of the injured State, or of any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought, should be taken into account in assessing the form and extent of reparation\".1104 This is consistent with \"the principle that full reparation is due for the injury \u2013 but nothing more \u2013 arising in consequence of the internationally wrongful act\", as well as with \"fairness as between the responsible State and the victim of the breach\".1105\n\nILC Articles with Commentaries, Commentary to Article 39, point (1).\n\n*Id*., point (2).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n574.\n\nThese provisions must be read in conjunction with ILC Article 31(1), according to which \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\". The Commentary to Article 31 clarifies that \"unless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct\".1106\n\nILC Articles with Commentaries, Commentary to Article 31, point (13).\n\n575.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, Burlington's conduct prior to the expropriation (specifically, its decision to stop paying Law 42 taxes, its threat of legal action against buyers in the *coactiva* auctions, its decision to suspend the operations, and its alleged \"boycotting\" of the negotiations with Ecuador) justifies the exclusion or reduction in damages.\n\n576.\n\nThe question is whether by engaging in the conduct that Ecuador complains of, Burlington contributed to the injury it suffered. The Tribunal notes in this respect that \"[n]ot every action or omission which contributes to the damage suffered is relevant for this purpose. Rather, article 39 allows to be taken into account only those actions or omissions which can be considered as wilful or negligent, i.e. which manifest a lack of due care on the part of the victim of the breach for his or her own property or rights.1107 In addition, this willful or negligent act or omission must have \"materially contributed to the damage\".1108\n\nILC Articles with Commentaries, Commentary to Article 39, point (5).\n\n*Id*., point (1).\n\n577.\n\nEcuador first argues that Burlington's failure to pay Law 42 taxes was the triggering factor for the chain of events that culminated with the expropriation of the Blocks. A majority of the Tribunal cannot agree. The triggering factor was the enactment of Law 42 and Ecuador's failure to abide by its contractual tax absorption obligations.\n\n578.\n\nIt was in response to Ecuador's contractual breaches that, from October 2008, Burlington stopped paying Law 42 taxes and instead deposited the relevant amounts in a segregated account. It is true that any person subject to the fiscal power of a state must pay its taxes,1109 unless they are declared unlawful or an agreement is entered into in this respect. Such an agreement was suggested in PO1, where the Tribunal recommended that the Parties should \"confer and make their best efforts to agree on the opening of an escrow account at an internationally recognized financial institution [\u2026]\",1110 failing which they should report back to the Tribunal for a different ruling.1111 But the Parties did not agree.\n\n*Micula v. Romania,* Award of 11 December 2013, \u00b6 1151 (**Exh. EL-248**).\n\nPO1, \u00b6 IV.1\n\nPO1, \u00b6 IV.6 (\"If the Parties cannot agree on the opening of an escrow account within 60 days from notification of this Order, they shall report to the Arbitral Tribunal setting forth the status of their negotiations and the content of and reasons for their disagreements after which the Arbitral Tribunal will rule on the outstanding issues\").\n\n579.\n\nMore importantly, Burlington's failure to pay Law 42 taxes cannot be said to have contributed to its injury. The injury suffered by Burlington and quantified in this Award is the loss of its investment and more particularly of its future profit-making potential. This damage was directly and decisively caused by Ecuador's permanent physical takeover of the Blocks; Burlington's conduct did not contribute to the magnitude of the loss or sever the chain of causation between the wrongful conduct and the injury.\n\n580.\n\nEven if Burlington's non-payment were considered to be one of the factors in the chain of events that eventually culminated in the takeover of the Blocks, it is neither the triggering factor (which as noted above was the enactment of Law 42 and Ecuador's failure to abide by its tax absorption obligations), nor the decisive factor. In this respect, the Tribunal has asked itself the following question: had Burlington paid its taxes but not agreed to a service contract, can it be concluded with reasonable certainty that the expropriation would not have occurred? On the basis of the record and especially of the findings in the Decision on Liability,1112 this question cannot be answered in the affirmative. Accordingly, a majority of the Tribunal confirms that Burlington's failure to pay Law 42 taxes did not contribute to the injury it suffered through the takeover of the Blocks. Arbitrator Stern disagrees with this analysis.1113\n\nSee, in particular: DoL, \u00b6\u00b6 311-315; 412-419.\n\nArbitrator Stern disagrees with the analysis of the majority on the contributory negligence of Burlington, as she is convinced that the behavior of Burlington refusing to pay its taxes played a major role in the chain of events leading to the expropriation. In other words, Arbitrator Stern believes that, if Burlington had paid its taxes, as it was obliged to do in order to respect the State's fiscal sovereignty, nothing would have happened.\n\n581.\n\nThe next question is whether Burlington's threat that it would suspend operations contributed to its injury. Ecuador argues that Burlington's threat to suspend the proceedings violated PO1, where the Tribunal ordered Burlington not to make good on this threat.1114 However, PO1 also ordered Ecuador to stop the *coactiva proceedings*, which Ecuador did not do,1115 and to refrain from any action inducing Burlington to suspend operations.1116 PO1 was revoked by PO2 in October 2009, but the Tribunal \"specified that the Parties remain under a duty not to further aggravate the dispute\".1117 Ultimately, both Parties violated the Tribunal's recommendations, with the result that a reference to PO1 is unhelpful. In any event, Burlington's announcement that it would suspend operations came after Ecuador had significantly aggravated the dispute through the *coactiva* proceedings.\n\nPO1, \u00b6 IV.8 (\"The Parties shall refrain from any conduct that may lead to an aggravation of the dispute until the Award or the reconsideration of this order. In particular, Burlington Oriente shall refrain from making good on its threat to abandon the project and Ecuador shall refrain from any action that may induce Burlington Oriente to do so\").\n\nPO1, \u00b6 IV.7 (\"The Respondents shall discontinue the proceedings pending against the Claimant under the coactiva process and shall not initiate new coactive actions\").\n\nPO1, \u00b6 IV.8.\n\nPO2, \u00b6 29.\n\n582.\n\nNor can it be said that Burlington contributed to the injury by refusing to sign the Transitory Agreements. Under the test set out in ILC Article 39, the question is whether Burlington's conduct can be characterized as a manifest lack of due care for its own property rights which materially contributed to the damage caused. Burlington's refusal to sign the Transitory Agreements or otherwise come to an agreement with Ecuador cannot be characterized as a manifest breach of due care for is property rights. To the contrary, Burlington was trying to protect its contractual rights. As Mr. Moyes stated during the Hearing:\n\n\"Looking at the Burlington letters... I see a company under duress.... And my understanding of the process of negotiation was Law 42 taxes you pay; you enter into a Transitory Agreement with the Government which is neither complete, it is not final; you continue paying taxes that you have a dispute about; and you waive your rights under the Participation Agreement to the tax-absorption clauses and to any other benefits within that Agreement. That is not a good negotiating position to put yourself into. That is not what I would recommend the client do\".1118\n\nTr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 991:2-992:1 (Tribunal, Moyes).\n\n583.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees that there is a duty to negotiate when there has been a significant change of circumstances, this duty does not force the parties to reach an agreement against their consent. Even if Burlington's \"hardball\" approach was one of the factors that induced Ecuador to take over the Blocks, it would be perverse to find that Burlington's decision to protect its valid and existing contract rights contributed to their being taken by force.\n\n584.\n\nFinally, Ecuador argues that Burlington's threat of legal action against buyers in the *coactiva* auctions contributed to its having earned less for the forced sale of oil. As the Tribunal has dismissed Burlington's claim for past Law 42 dues taken or seized, it does not need to address this argument.\n\n585.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, a majority of the Tribunal rejects Ecuador's argument that Burlington contributed to its own losses.\n\n**F. Post-Award Interest**\n--------------------------\n\n586.\n\nIt is undisputed that Burlington has a right to post-award interest. As noted in Section VII.D.5.3.3 above, the Parties agree that post-award interest shall accrue at the same rate and periodicity as pre-award interest.\n\n587.\n\nBecause the Tribunal has used 31 August 2016 as valuation date, interest shall accrue to the Award on damages from the following day, i.e. 1 September 2016.\n\n588.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal awards interest on the total amount of damages awarded, compounded annually, at the rate of LIBOR plus two percent for 3-month borrowings, which shall accrue from 1 September 2016, i.e. the day following the date of valuation, until the date of payment.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n589.\n\nThe Tribunal will first provide a summary of each Party's position on costs incurred in connection with both claims and counterclaims (Sections A and B), before turning to its analysis (Section C).\n\nA. **Burlington's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n590.\n\nBurlington requests \"full indemnification for the costs it reasonably incurred in pursuing compensation for its losses\".1119 According to Burlington, \"an award of indemnity costs (i) is necessary to give effect to the governing principle of full reparation, and (ii) is further justified in light of Ecuador's conduct in these proceedings\".1120\n\nC-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 1.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n591.\n\nFirst, Burlington argues that the principle of full reparation requires that it be awarded its costs in full. Because compensation must wipe out the consequences of Ecuador's unlawful acts and restore Burlington to the position it would have been in had Ecuador not breached the Treaty, \"Ecuador's obligation [\u2026] requires not only the payment of damages representing the value of the assets Ecuador unlawfully expropriated; it also requires reimbursement of the costs Burlington legitimately incurred in pursuing that compensation\".1121 As a result, \"[a]ny award that fails to compensate a successful litigant for the reasonable costs it incurred in pursuing its claim is not an award of full reparation, but something falling short of that international law standard\".1122\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, citing: *ADC v. Hungary,* Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 533 (**Exh. CL-101**) ; *Hrvatska Elektroprivada d.d. v. Republic of Slovenia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/24 *(\"\u2018Hrvatska v.

According to Burlington, the \"contemporary approach\" is to shift costs to the losing party.1124\n\n*Ibid.* See also: Reply, \u00b6 354.\n\nReply, \u00b6 354, citing: *Libananco Holdings Co. Ltd. v.

Although each side prevailed on some arguments and lost on others, it was Burlington who prevailed on the two determinative questions that constitute the core of the dispute between the Parties, namely (a) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction over this dispute and (b) whether Ecuador violated the Treaty. To allocate costs on an argument-by-argument basis would ignore the fact that Burlington was forced to spend considerable time and money to recover the compensation for the unlawful expropriation of its investment.1125 According to Burlington, \"[t]he test is not whether all of Burlington's arguments were accepted, but whether, once it has been established that Ecuador's conduct giving rise to this arbitration was unlawful and triggered an obligation of full reparation, Burlington's claims and its associated costs were the natural consequence of Ecuador's unlawful conduct\".1126 Burlington submits that \"full reparation requires full indemnification of those costs \u2013 costs that would never have been incurred by Burlington in the absence of Ecuador's unlawful conduct\".1127\n\nC-Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10; Reply, \u00b6 353.\n\nC-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 11.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n594.\n\nSecond, Burlington argues that a full costs award is further justified by Ecuador's conduct in these proceedings. For Burlington, \"Ecuador's conduct has exacerbated and delayed these proceedings at every stage, and has significantly increased the costs incurred by Burlington\".1128 In particular, Burlington argues that:\n\ni. Ecuador violated the Tribunal's order for provisional measures, which in Burlington's submission was binding, thus aggravating the dispute, foreclosing the primary relief requested by Burlington (specific performance of the PSCs) and showing contempt for the Tribunal.1129 Burlington argues in particular that \"had [Ecuador] complied with the Tribunal's provisional measures order, a significant proportion (at the very least) of these proceedings would have been avoided\".1130\n\nii. Ecuador's request to trifurcate these proceedings into separate jurisdiction, merits and quantum phases added unnecessary expense and delay.1131\n\niii. In addition, Ecuador \"asserted manufactured counterclaims, solely in an attempt to offset the damages it would owe for having breached Burlington's international law rights\", which gave rise to an additional phase of the proceedings involving over 1,400 pages of briefs, 7 days of hearings and a 5-day site visit to a remote location in Ecuador, which was \"further prolonged by Ecuador's insistence on repeatedly re-pleading its case on the basis of alternate legal, technical and quantum theories\".1132\n\niv. Ecuador sought a sixth phase of the arbitration through its \"baseless motion for \u2018reconsideration'\", requesting bifurcation twice. Although these attempts to bifurcate were unsuccessful, they nonetheless caused a \"protracted and costly debate between the parties\".1133\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 13.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 14.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 15.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 16.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 17.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 18.\n\n595.\n\nFurther, Burlington denies that the interim decision of the *Perenco* tribunal on Ecuador's environmental counterclaim in the *Perenco* arbitration (the \" *Perenco* Interim Decision\")1134 entitles Ecuador to the costs related to its counterclaims in this arbitration. No tribunal has ever awarded costs on the basis of another tribunal's interim decision. Even if the *Perenco* Interim Decision were relevant to this Tribunal's cost award (*quod non*), \"that decision does not find in favor of Ecuador on any of its counterclaims, and it certainly does not support a costs award in favor of Ecuador in this case\".1135 Burlington emphasizes that the *Perenco* tribunal reserved its final finding on liability over the counterclaims, and noted that \"the remaining issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages anywhere near the amount claimed by Ecuador\".1136 Burlington also argues that the *Perenco* tribunal agreed with many of Burlington's arguments in this arbitration, \"including that (1) Ecuadorian regulations (and not background values) set the standard for legal harm; (2) Ecuadorian regulations and practice allow for permanent disposal of drilling mud and cuttings in on-site mud pits; (3) strict liability does not apply prior to October 2008; (4) delineation is the industry standard method to determine the extent of contamination; (5) IEMS's models are unreliable and cannot be used to establish the extent of contamination; and (6) local remediation costs are applicable\".1137 As a result, Burlington contends that there are \"no grounds for Ecuador's assertion that it was successful on its counterclaims in the *Perenco* case, and even less justification for seeking costs in this case on that unfounded basis\".1138 If anything, Burlington submits that the *Perenco* Interim Decision \"confirms that Ecuador's counterclaim \u2013 except for the limited US$ 1.09 million that Burlington concedes is due to Consortium operations \u2013 is a largely manufactured claim designed to offset Burlington's expropriation damages [\u2026]\".1139\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/06, Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim of 11 August 2015 (the \" *Perenco* Interim Decision\").\n\nC-Reply Submission on Costs, \u00b6 4.\n\n*Perenco* Interim Decision, \u00b6 593.\n\nC-Reply Submission on Costs, \u00b6 5.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 11.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 13.\n\n596.\n\nFor these reasons, Burlington requests \"indemnification in full, pursuant to Rule 28(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, of costs incurred in this arbitration, in addition to compound interest assessed at a reasonable commercial rate from the date of the award to the date of payment\".1140\n\nC-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 19.\n\n597.\n\nBurlington alleges that it has incurred in total fees and expenses amounting to USD 48,171,235.14 in these proceedings, broken down as follows:1141\n\ni. Fees (including for legal fees, experts and other services) related to the merits (the Tribunal understands this to mean fees incurred in connection with the principal claims, including jurisdiction): USD 23,986,145.89;\n\nii. Expenses related to the merits: USD 2,453,258.53;\n\niii. Fees (including for legal fees, experts and other services) related to the counterclaims: USD 16,892,289.00;\n\niv. Expenses related to the counterclaims: USD 2,239,541.72; and\n\nv. Advances to ICSID: although in its Submission on Costs Burlington indicates that it has advanced USD 2,600,000, the Tribunal notes that, as of the date of this Award, Burlington has advanced USD 3,250,000.\n\nC-Reply Submission on Costs, note 10, and Annex A, \"Revised Summary of Fees and Expenses in US Dollars\".\n\n598.\n\nBurlington argues that the costs listed above are reasonable in light of the length and complexity of the proceedings. Burlington notes that \"[t]his arbitration involved five separate phases \u2013 provisional measures, jurisdiction, merits, counterclaims, quantum and reconsideration \u2013 each of which required extensive pleadings and hearings\", which required a combined total of 30 major briefs totaling over 3,000 pages on highly complex and technical issues (not counting numerous submissions on procedural matters), accompanied by 18 witness statements and 15 expert reports, and involving five hearings and one site visit.1142\n\nC-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 20.\n\n599.\n\nIn light of the above, Burlington requests the Tribunal to:\n\n\"[\u2026]\n\n(e) ORDER Ecuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Burlington's legal and expert fees;\n\n(f) ORDER Ecuador to pay compound interest on the sum awarded in (e), above, until the date of effective and complete payment, at such a rate and for such a period of compounding as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate in the circumstances; and\n\n(g) AWARD such further and other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate\".1143\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 249.\n\nB. **Ecuador's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n600.\n\nEcuador's submissions on costs distinguish the costs pertaining to the principal claims (1), those pertaining to Petroecuador (2), and those pertaining to the counterclaims (3).\n\n**1. Costs related to the principal claims**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n601.\n\nWith respect to the costs incurred for the principal claims, Ecuador's primary position is that it should recover all of these costs because \"Ecuador is the clearly successful party\" in respect of these claims.1144 Ecuador submits that, \"in the event the Tribunal reconsiders its unlawful expropriation holding, or finds that Burlington's behavior contributed to its loss to such an extent as to negate or significantly reduce compensation, Burlington's unmeritorious case falls away and Ecuador will have fully prevailed in this matter\".1145 As a result, applying Burlington's own standard, it is entitled to recover all of its costs related to the principal claims. Ecuador claims in this respect a total of USD 13,429,238.96 in legal and expert fees and expenses,1146 and 100% of the costs of the arbitration (i.e. the Tribunal's fees and expense and ICSID's administrative expenses), as apportioned by the Tribunal to the principal claims,1147 plus simple interest on any costs awarded at the \"commercially reasonable rate of LIBOR + 2%, or alternatively at another commercially reasonable rate, from the date of this Award until payment\".1148\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 2.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 7.\n\nAs further broken down in Annex 2 of Ecuador's Submission on Costs.\n\nEcuador's position with respect to the advances paid by the Parties to ICSID is that, as these advances are meant to cover the Tribunal's fees and expenses and ICSID's administrative expenses, the Tribunal is in a better position to apportion them than the Parties. As a result, Ecuador only specifies the percentage that it seeks to recover in each proceeding. R-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 4. The Tribunal notes that the total amount advanced by Ecuador to ICSID is USD 2,950,000.\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 8.\n\n602.\n\nAlternatively, Ecuador contends that even if the Tribunal were to reject Ecuador's Motion for Reconsideration and its argument that Burlington contributed to its own losses, there is no clear successful party in these proceedings because each side will have prevailed on certain issues. With one exception (Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks), all of Burlington's claims were found to be either inadmissible, outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction or simply meritless.1149 In addition, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal found the expropriation to be unlawful only because of Ecuador's failure to pay or offer compensation, and Burlington has inflated the amount of compensation during these proceedings. As a result the Tribunal should apply the \"pay your own way\" rule, so that Ecuador should bear only its own legal and expert fees and expenses, and half of the costs of the arbitration.1150 According to Ecuador, this has been the practice of ICSID tribunals,1151 who have departed from it only in exceptional circumstances.1152 Ecuador notes in particular that tribunals have applied the \"pay your own way\" rule in circumstances similar to those of this case, in cases where claimants have only partially prevailed on jurisdiction and the merits,1153 where the State was liable for some treaty violations but not others,1154 and even when the claimants have won all their claims, but recovered a monetary compensation much lower than the amount claimed.1155 For Ecuador, this would be no different to applying Burlington's \"modern rule in favor of cost shifting\" onto the losing party.1156 Only in rare circumstances have tribunals shifted 100% of the costs, and in Ecuador's submission the circumstances of this case do not justify such a shift.1157\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 9; CM, \u00b6\u00b6 585-589.\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 10; CM, \u00b6\u00b6 569-574; Reply, \u00b6 354, referring to: *Enron v.

Burlington has advanced a formalistic reading of the applicable legislation, according to which only designated protected zones are considered sensitive ecosystems. According to Ecuador, this position is absurd and has protracted the debate between the Parties.1167\n\nii. Burlington disputed the presence of contamination on the basis that it was not visible, when its own witness, Mr. Saltos, testified that environmental incidents had taken place but that traces of contamination were not visible. This forced Ecuador (through IEMS) to undertake a costly and extensive investigation to measure the extent of the contamination in the Blocks.1168\n\niii. Burlington portrayed the Consortium as a \"model operator\", forcing Ecuador to carry out detailed and costly site assessments to determine the real environmental condition of the Blocks. These site assessments disproved Burlington's assertion that all significant incidents had been dealt with in a timely fashion and disclosed to the authorities.1169 After reviewing similar evidence, the *Perenco* tribunal concluded that the Consortium's \"claims of strong environmental law compliance are not made out\", and that \"there is some evidence that [the Consortium] was less than forthcoming in some instances\".1170\n\niv. Burlington relied on GSI, whose \"utter disregard and manipulation of data\", \"inappropriate sampling methodologies\" and \"inadequate delineation based on insufficient and unreliable data\" required additional effort and costs from Ecuador and its experts.1171 Ecuador argues that its criticism of GSI has been vindicated by the *Perenco* tribunal.1172\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 3.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 17.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 18.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 19.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 20, citing: *Perenco* Interim Decision, \u00b6 447.\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 21.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 21, referring generally to: the *Perenco* Interim Decision.\n\n609.\n\nIn light of the above, Ecuador contends that Burlington and its expert have been compelled to acknowledge that the Consortium's operations caused contamination within the Blocks. Ecuador notes in particular that \"Burlington has recognized that 37,555 m3 require remediation in 17 sites\", and as a result \"it may no longer pretend that the Consortium has not caused significant negative impact to the Blocks\".1173\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 22.\n\n610.\n\nAs a result, Ecuador submits that it is entitled to all costs related to the counterclaims, regardless of the volume of contamination.1174 For Ecuador, because Burlington's obstructionist behavior \"unnecessarily and unacceptably\" forced Ecuador and the Tribunal to incur increased costs in the counterclaims phase, Burlington should now pay for this.1175\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 16.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 23.\n\n611.\n\nContrary to Burlington's contentions, Ecuador submits that the *Perenco* Interim Decision is relevant for purposes of allocating costs in this arbitration for at least three reasons:\n\ni. Should the Tribunal accept Ecuador's counterclaim in its entirety, Ecuador would be the \"clearly successful party\" and would be entitled to recover all of its costs. The Tribunal could take the *Perenco* Interim Decision into account in coming to this decision.1176\n\nii. Should the Tribunal accept Ecuador's counterclaim only partially but decide that there is no clearly successful party, Ecuador contends that the *Perenco* Interim Decision provides a basis for a full order on costs against Burlington, regardless of the volume of contamination for which Burlington is held liable or the ultimate costs of remediation awarded by the Tribunal. For Ecuador, the *Perenco* tribunal's findings confirm that Burlington did not comply with environmental standards and concealed the contamination in the Blocks. Were the Tribunal not to award costs to Ecuador on this basis, \"this would send a message to the international community that an investor can pollute the lands of a Host State, hide such pollution, avoid remediating it, and yet not bear any costs for such egregious conduct\".1177\n\niii. Even if the Tribunal should reject Ecuador's counterclaim in its entirety, the *Perenco* Interim Decision demonstrates that Ecuador's counterclaim was justified and reasonable, and as such provides grounds for the Tribunal to conclude that Ecuador should bear no more than its own legal and expert fees and costs and half of the costs of the arbitration allocated by the Tribunal to the counterclaims proceedings.1178\n\nR-Reply on Costs, \u00b6 3.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 4.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 5.\n\n612.\n\nEcuador also submits that it is entitled to its legal and expert fees and costs related to the infrastructure counterclaim. Ecuador contends that it is \"clearly the successful party\" with respect to this claim,1179 as it has \"thoroughly demonstrated that the Consortium did not follow the best standards and practices in the oil industry, establishing through contemporaneous evidence that the equipment and infrastructure were in a sub-standard state because the Consortium did not have any preventative or predictive maintenance plans and simply operated under a \u2018run-to-failure' strategy\".1180 By contrast, Ecuador alleges that Burlington has not provided any contemporaneous evidence of the Consortium's alleged maintenance practices, and its other defenses fail.1181\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 27.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 25.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 26.\n\n613.\n\nIn the alternative, should the Tribunal find that there is no clearly successful party, Ecuador submits that Burlington should be ordered to pay all costs incurred by Ecuador in connection with the infrastructure counterclaim, because \"Burlington's blatant denial of the poor state of the infrastructure \u2013 notwithstanding clear evidence of wide-scale breaches of the Consortium's obligations under the Participation Contracts and Ecuadorian law \u2013 unnecessarily increased the complexity of these proceedings and, with it, the costs Ecuador has had to bear\".1182\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 27.\n\n614.\n\nEcuador claims for all of its costs in connection with the counterclaims, including USD 12,439,746.75 incurred in legal and expert fees and expenses,1183 as well 100% of the Tribunal's fees and expenses and ICSID administrative costs apportioned by the Tribunal to the counterclaims, plus simple interest at LIBOR plus two percent, or alternatively at another commercially reasonable rate, from the date of the Award until payment.1184\n\nEcuador's costs in connection with the counterclaims are summarized in Annex 4 of its Submission on Costs.\n\nR-Submission on Costs, \u00b6 29. Ecuador clarifies that, although in its PHB on Counterclaims (at \u00b6 1019) it requested interest on costs \"at an adequate commercial interest rate\", in its submission this means the same as interest at a \"commercially reasonable rate\". *Ibid*.\n\n615.\n\nFinally, in its Reply Ecuador makes certain comments on three authorities filed by Burlington with its Reply, specifically, *Olguin v. Republic of Paraguay,1185 Ren\u00e9e* *Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru*,1186 and *Hrvatska Elektroprivada d.d. v. The Republic of Slovenia*.1187 Ecuador states that it agrees with the principles expressed in *Olguin* and *Levy,* namely that a claimant's procedural conduct may require it to contribute to the costs of the proceedings despite it having been successful in its claims,1188 and that \"a finding of abuse of process justifies an award of costs against the unsuccessful party\".1189 That being said, Ecuador \"disagrees that these principles have any bearing in its regard, however, and strongly disputes Burlington's characterization of Ecuador's behavior in this proceedings\".1190 By contrast, Ecuador denies that the principle for which Burlington cites *Hrvastka* (namely, that costs follow the event) applies in international law. According to Ecuador, authorities already in the record contradict this position.1191\n\n*Olguin v. Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5 *(\"Olguin v.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**1. Applicable standards**\n---------------------------\n\n617.\n\nThe Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration between the Parties, including legal fees and expenses, as it deems appropriate pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\".\n\n618.\n\nThe Parties have not disputed this discretion.\n\n619.\n\nIn the exercise of this discretion, investment tribunals have tended to apply one of two main approaches to the allocation of costs. Some tribunals have been guided by the principle of \"costs follow the event\" and have thus awarded all or part of the costs to the prevailing party.1193 Other tribunals have split the costs of the arbitration between the parties and ordered each party to bear its own costs.1194 Some tribunals effectively apply a mix of the two approaches, starting from one and mitigating its results with the other, or considering a series of factors to be taken into account to award costs.1195\n\nSee, for instance: *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 *(\"Plama v. Bulgaria\u2019\u2019)* Award of 27 August 2008, \u00b6 316 (**Exh. EL-306**) ; *EDF v. Romania,* Award of 8 October 2009, \u00b6 327 (**Exh. EL-59**) ; *ADC v. Hungary,* Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 533; *Lemire v. Ukraine,* Award of 28 March 2011, \u00b6 380 **(Exh. EL-279**) ; *Libananco v. Turkey,* Award of 2 September 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 563-565 (**Exh. cL-287**).\n\nSee, for instance: *Enron v. Argentina,* Award of 22 May 2007, \u00b6 453 (**Exh. CL-81**) ; *Sempra v. Argentina,* Award of 28 September 2007, \u00b6 487.5 (**Exh. CL-80**) ; *Vieira v. Chile,* Award of 21 August 2007, \u00b6 305 (**Exh. EL-297**) ; *Anderson v. Costa Rica,* Award of 19 May 2010, \u00b6 62 (**Exh. EL-301**) ; *AES v. Hungary,* Award of 23 September 2010, \u00b6 15.3.3 (**Exh. EL-168**).\n\nSee, for instance: *Parkerings v. Lithuania,* Award of 11 September 2007, \u00b6 462 (**Exh. CL-119**) (holding that \"the question of costs is within the discretion of the Tribunal with regard, on the one hand, to the outcome of the proceedings and, on the other hand, to other relevant factors\"). See also: *Funnekotter v. Zimbabwe,* Award of 22 April 2009, \u00b6 147 (**Exh. CL-150**).\n\n620.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the apportionment of costs requires an analysis of all of the circumstances of the case, including to what extent a party has contributed to the costs of the arbitration and whether that contribution was reasonable and justified.1196 This analysis should start by considering whether a party has prevailed on its claims, and if it has prevailed only in part, whether the rejected claims were reasonable or frivolous.1197 It should also take into account the procedural conduct of the parties, and in particular whether such conduct delayed the proceedings or increased costs unnecessarily. The Tribunal notes that both Parties appear to be in agreement with these main principles: each Party considers itself to be the prevailing party, and as such seeks the recovery of all of its costs. In addition, each Party considers that the other party's conduct justifies a full award of costs in its favor.\n\nSee, for instance: *Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award of 25 November 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 232-235 (apportioning costs after \"taking all the circumstances of th[e] case into account\u2019); *Helnan v. Egypt*, Award of 3 July 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 173-174 (also apportioning costs after having \"taken into considerations all the circumstances of th[e] case\") (**Exh. EL-299**).\n\nSee: C. H. Schreuer et al., *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition, 2009), p. 1233 (\"Even the cases in which tribunals declined to award costs indicate a growing awareness of the principle that the losing party should bear the consequences in terms of costs also\") (**Exh. eL-370**).\n\n621.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, after a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, the principles above may be adjusted to take into account that the respondent is a sovereign State. In particular, it considers that, even if a tribunal finds that a State has breached its international obligations vis-\u00e0-vis an investor, consideration must be given to the State's motives and good faith. In particular, where the actions of a State have been guided by its good faith understanding of the public interest and the State could reasonably doubt that it was breaching its international obligations, the Tribunal may consider it appropriate to apportion costs in a manner that alleviates the burden on the respondent State. These considerations apply to situations in which the State is the respondent, not the claimant.\n\n622.\n\nThe Tribunal will be guided by these principles when apportioning costs. The Tribunal will first address the costs incurred by Petroecuador (2), and will then address the bulk of the Parties' costs pertaining to the claims and counterclaims (3).\n\n**2. Costs incurred by Petroecuador**\n-------------------------------------\n\n623.\n\nEcuador submits that, as a result of the withdrawal of claims by the Contract Claimants (also referred to as the Burlington Subsidiaries), Petroecuador is the prevailing party with respect to those claims and must recover all of its costs, amounting to USD 48,589.72.\n\n624.\n\nIn PO2, the Tribunal stated that it was \"aware that the withdrawal of the Contract Claims will have an effect on the apportionment of the costs in this proceeding, and will deal with that issue at a later stage, presumably in the Final Award\".1198\n\nPO2, \u00b6 23. See also: *Id*., p. 14, \u00b6 III.3.\n\n625.\n\nApplying the principles outlined in the preceding sections, the Tribunal considers that Burlington must bear Petroecuador's costs in full. Petroecuador was only a party to these proceedings because the Contract Claimants had brought the Contract Claims1199 against it. As a result of the withdrawal of the Contract Claims,1200 Petroecuador ceased to be a party in these proceedings.1201 While the Contract Claimants also ceased to be parties in these proceedings for the same reasons1202 and can no longer be ordered to cover Petroecuador's costs, the Tribunal deems it appropriate for Burlington, as the Contract Claimants' controlling shareholder, to bear this burden.\n\nAs defined in the Claimants' Request for Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 13(c), and CM, Section IV.\n\nClaimants' letter of 18 September 2009, p. 3. See also: Claimants' letter of 10 October 2009, p.1; PO2, \u00b6 10; \u00b6\u00b6 11-18, and DoJ, \u00b6 80.\n\nPO2, \u00b6 19 and p. 14, \u00b6 III.1; DoJ, \u00b6 80.\n\nPO2, \u00b6 19 and p. 14, \u00b6 III.1.\n\n626.\n\nEcuador has requested simple interest at LIBOR plus two percent on awarded costs, from the date of the Award until payment. For the reasons set out in Section VII.D.5.3.3 above, the Tribunal considers that LIBOR plus two percent for three month borrowings is an appropriate interest rate. Also for the reasons set out in that section, the Tribunal is of the opinion that this amount must be compounded annually. In this case, because costs are fixed on the date of the Award and do not depend on the date of valuation of the compensation due to Burlington, interest will accrue from the date of the Award, as requested, until the date of payment.\n\n**3. Costs pertaining to the claims and counterclaims**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n627.\n\nBoth Parties seek recovery of all of their costs pertaining to the claims and counterclaims. Alternatively, Ecuador requests that it be required to bear only its own legal and expert fees and expenses, and half of the costs of the arbitration (ICSID and Tribunal fees and costs).\n\n628.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to order the Ecuador to bear 65% of the costs of the arbitration (Burlington bearing 35%), and for each Party to bear its own legal costs and expenses, for the following reasons.\n\n629.\n\nFirst, Burlington prevailed on its claims, in the sense that the Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction and found that Ecuador had breached the Treaty. That said, the Tribunal also found that it lacked jurisdiction over many of Burlington's claims, found other claims inadmissible, and held that several of Burlington's claims were meritless. Similarly, the Tribunal rejected two out of three of Burlington's damages claims and some of its legal and financial assumptions, with the result that the compensation awarded to Burlington is 25% of the amount claimed.\n\n630.\n\nOn the other hand, while Ecuador also prevailed on part of its counterclaims, the amount awarded to Ecuador is an extremely small percentage of the amount claimed. Contrary to Ecuador's contention, the Tribunal does not consider that the *Perenco* Interim Decision provides grounds for a full award of costs to Ecuador on the counterclaims, regardless of the extent of contamination. The Tribunal is not bound by the *Perenco* tribunal's findings of fact or holdings of law. Although as previously noted the majority believes that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals,1203 the *Perenco* tribunal's decision does not form part of a series of established cases to which this Tribunal should defer. In any event, as Burlington correctly points out, the *Perenco* tribunal has not yet ruled on the Consortium's final liability, and its decision provides support for some of Burlington's arguments.\n\nSee: paragraph 44 above. See also: DoJ, \u00b6 100; DoL, \u00b6 187.\n\n631.\n\nMore importantly, the Tribunal considers that its decision on the apportionment of costs must be made on the basis of the circumstances of these proceedings alone. On the basis of the record before it, the Tribunal has found that, while the Consortium did not always comply with the applicable environmental standards, the actual contamination attributable to the Consortium was nowhere near as extensive as Ecuador alleged, nor were the remediation costs as high as Ecuador claimed.\n\n632.\n\nSecond, while the Tribunal agrees with Burlington that Ecuador's procedural conduct increased the length and cost of the proceedings, the Tribunal finds that Ecuador's procedural requests were generally reasonable under the circumstances. Ecuador's request for a trifurcation of the proceedings into separate jurisdiction, merits and quantum phases was not unreasonable in light of the complexity of the claims, which at that time also included claims of the Burlington Subsidiaries. Further, given the lack of clarity in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules as to whether a tribunal may reconsider a pre-award decision, it cannot be held illegitimate for Ecuador to have filed a Motion for Reconsideration. Ultimately, that motion was heard jointly with the quantum phase and did not require a separate phase. And while the delay and expense caused by the counterclaims phase may be considered to have been disproportionate to the amount awarded, such disproportion is somewhat mitigated by the public interest that underlies Ecuador's environmental counterclaim, namely the protection of the Amazon rainforest, which represents a major stake in the survival of mankind.\n\n633.\n\nHaving assessed all of these elements, and in the exercise of its discretion in matters of cost allocation, the Tribunal deems it reasonable for Ecuador to bear 65% the costs of the arbitration (ICSID and Tribunal fees and expenses), and for Burlington to bear 35% of those costs.\n\n634.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal finds it appropriate for each Party to bear its own legal and expert costs. In addition to the reasons given above, the Tribunal notes that Burlington's costs, in particular with respect to the claims, are significantly greater than Ecuador's. Differences in disputing parties' costs are to be expected, as they essentially depend on the litigation choices that a party may make to advance its case. The disparity of the levels of costs between the Parties here is an additional reason for which the Tribunal finds it appropriate for each Party to bear its own legal and expert fees and expenses.\n\n**IX. OPERATIVE PART**\n----------------------\n\n635.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\nA. Denies Ecuador's Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision on Liability;\n\nB. Denies Ecuador's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility advanced in this phase;\n\nC. On quantum:\n\n1. Orders Ecuador to pay to Burlington the amount of USD 379,802,267 together with interest, compounded annually, at LIBOR for three month borrowings plus two percent, which shall accrue from 1 September 2016, until payment;\n\n2. Declares that the Award is net of income and labor participation taxes and that Ecuador may not impose or attempt to impose income and labor participation taxes on the Award;\n\nD. On costs:\n\n1. Burlington shall bear the entirety of Petroecuador's costs in the arbitration and is therefore ordered to pay Petroecuador the amount of USD 48,589.72, together with interest, compounded annually, at LIBOR for three month borrowings plus two percent, which shall accrue from the date of this Award until payment;\n\n2. Ecuador shall bear 65% of the costs of the arbitration as determined by ICSID's final financial statement, and Burlington shall bear 35% of those costs;\n\n3. Each Party shall bear its own legal and expert costs;\n\nE.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 14, 2017, the Secretary-General registered an application for annulment of the Award rendered on February 7, 2017 in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, filed by the Republic of Ecuador (the \"**Application for Annulment**\"). The Application for Annulment included a stay of enforcement request. Specifically, it requested that the Secretary-General notify the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, and that the stay be continued by the *ad hoc* Committee once constituted.\n\n2.\n\nOn February 14, 2017, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the provisional stay of the enforcement of the Award, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n3.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6 and 53. Its Members are: Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (Spanish) President, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Spain; Piero Bernardini (Italian), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Italy, and Vera Van Houtte (Belgian) designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Belgium.\n\n4.\n\nOn May 19, 2017, Burlington Resources, Inc. (**\"Burlington\" or \"Claimant\"**) filed its Opposition to Ecuador's Application to Continue the Stay and Application to Require Ecuador to Post Adequate Financial Security as a Condition to Continuing the Stay or, Alternatively, to Lift the Stay (\"**Burlington's Opposition\"**).\n\n5.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, Ecuador filed its Response to Burlington's Request to Lift the Provisional Stay or to Condition the Stay on the Posting of Security **(\"Ecuador's Response\")**.\n\n6.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Burlington filed its Reply to Ecuador's Response to Burlington's Opposition to Ecuador's Application to Continue the Stay and Application to Require Ecuador to Post Adequate Financial Security as a Condition to Continuing the Stay or, Alternatively, to Lift the Stay (\"**Burlington's Reply\"**).\n\n7.\n\nOn June 2, 2017, the Applicant confirmed its agreement to extend the 30-day limit contained in ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) for the Committee to render its decision on stay of enforcement. On the same date, the Claimant confirmed its willingness to extend the same time limit until August 31, 2017 or dates reasonably close to this date.\n\n8.\n\nFollowing the first session of the Committee and preliminary procedural consultation with the Parties on June 23, 2017, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning procedural matters on June 30, 2017.\n\n9.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder to Burlington's Request to Lift the Provisional Stay or to Condition the Stay on the Posting of Security (\"**Ecuador's Rejoinder\"**).\n\n10.\n\nThe hearing on stay of enforcement was held on July 18, 2017.\n\n**II. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n*a. Ecuador's Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nEcuador requested the stay of enforcement in its Application for Annulment (the \"Request\"). It also requested that the stay continue after the constitution of the Committee. In both instances the request was not supported by any justification.\n\n*b. Burlington's Opposition*\n----------------------------\n\n12.\n\nPromptly after the constitution of the Committee, the Claimant filed its Opposition to Ecuador's Application to Continue the Stay and its Application to require Ecuador to Post Adequate Financial Security as a Condition to Continuing the Stay or, Alternatively, to Lift the Stay (the \"Opposition to Ecuador's Application\"). The Claimant points out that Ecuador has failed to justify the Request and recalls that \"Arbitration Rule 54(4) requires the party moving for a continuance of the stay to 'specify the circumstances that require the stay.'\"1 Thus, Ecuador carries the burden to show that a stay is required in the circumstances. The Claimant contends that by not alleging any circumstances to justify its Request, Ecuador has failed to discharge its burden of proof.\n\nOpposition, para. 14.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that, while neither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules specify which factors have to be considered by annulment committees, these enjoy a measure of discretion in their appreciation of the circumstances that justify the continuation of the stay; one such circumstance is whether there is a risk that the applicant will not promptly comply with the award if it is not annulled. The Claimant enumerates other factors:\n\n*\"(i) statements and conduct of public officials, (ii) the risk to the award creditor of non-recovery, (iii) the possibility of irreparable harm to either party, (iv) whether the stay request is* prima facie *of a dilatory nature, (v) the implementation of the ICSID Convention in domestic law, (vi) the overall balance of interests between the parties, and (vii) past compliance with payment obligations, including ICSID awards.\"2*\n\n*Id.*, para. 19.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the exceptional nature of the stay of enforcement is the reason that justifies the requirement of security to counterbalance the negative effect of the stay on the award creditor. The Claimant alleges the serious risk that Ecuador will not comply with the Award promptly and in full based on Ecuador's hostility to ICSID arbitrations and specifically as shown in the underlying arbitration. In this respect, the Claimant enumerates steps taken by Ecuador that delayed and increased the cost of the proceedings, statements critical of ICSID arbitration by the highest-ranking officials of Ecuador, including the President, and Ecuador's statement that it would seek annulment of the Award even before it completed its review.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant points out, inter alia, that Ecuador has also challenged adverse non-ICSID awards, denounced the ICSID Convention, terminated at least 22 BITs, has a Constitutional Court which declared the dispute settlement provisions of BITs inconsistent with the Constitution, refused to comply with interim measures in the underlying arbitration and in other instances, and exhibited dilatory and obstructionist conduct in annulment proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant refers to a presentation recommending specific strategies to protect Ecuador's assets prepared by the Legal counsel to the President of the country in the context of the *Chevron I* Award. When five years later Ecuador paid that award, it did so \"because Chevron had gained enough leverage and information to threaten Ecuador's assets and banking relationships, not because it recognized its obligation to comply under international law.\"3 The Claimant brings also to the attention of the Committee the refusal of Ecuador to comply with interim awards in the *Chevron II* case and concludes that Ecuador is \"a classic case of serious doubt as to prompt compliance.\"4\n\n*Id.*, para. 56.\n\n*Id.*, para. 58.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, while there is no prejudice to Ecuador in providing security, absence of security and continuation of the stay would cause great prejudice to the Claimant. In support the Claimant refers to Ecuadorian law that acknowledges that delaying enforcement of a judgment causes damages to the prevailing party and requires a party seeking review of an appellate decision to provide security sufficient to cover those damages. The Claimant argues that security merely serves as a necessary procedural safeguard, it is \"a reasonable compromise in exchange for staying enforcement of the Award that Ecuador is legally required to comply 'without delay.'\"5 According to the Claimant, \"rewarding a hostile award debtor like Ecuador in these circumstances and with its history would encourage the routine filing of annulment applications and requests for unconditional enforcement stays.\"6 In addition, the Claimant asserts that the interest rate set in the Award is lower than the rate of interest on borrowings by Ecuador, hence by delaying payment of the Award Ecuador effectively borrows at a lower cost.\n\n*Id.*, para. 64.\n\n*Id.*, para. 76.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant addresses the argument usually raised in annulment proceedings that there is a danger of non-recoupment by the State if the Award is annulled. The Claimant affirms that no such risk is present in the security requested by the Claimant: \"should the Committee reject the annulment application, those amounts would be released to Burlington; and should the Committee annul the Award, the escrowed security amount and all accumulated interest would revert to Ecuador.\"7\n\n*Id.*, para. 79.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, if Ecuador refuses to post adequate financial security, then its commitment to comply voluntarily in the event its request is denied (in accordance with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention) would not be demonstrated and the stay should be lifted. In such a case, the Claimant undertakes to place in escrow all funds collected through enforced payment during the annulment proceeding; such funds to be returned to Ecuador if its annulment application is successful.8 The Claimant concludes that here again there is no risk of non-recoupment.\n\n*Id.*, paras. 9 and 80.\n\n*c. Ecuador's Response*\n-----------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn its Response to the Claimant's Request to lift the Provisional Stay or to Condition the Stay on the Posting of Security (the \"Response\"), Ecuador argues that the Committee is not empowered to condition a stay because (i) the Convention does not expressly grant ad hoc committees the power to order security when deciding whether or not to stay an award, (ii) the request for the posting of security is a request for provisional measures and Article 47 is not included in Article 52(4) among the articles applicable to arbitration proceedings that also apply to annulment proceedings, (iii) the Convention contrasts with other texts that expressly empower the relevant judicial authority to provide for adequate security such as the New York Convention, that was already in effect at the time the Convention was drafted, and the UNCITRAL Model Law, and (iv) the reliance of Burlington's on the decisions of previous ad hoc committees is misplaced.\n\n21.\n\nIn the alternative, Ecuador argues that the Claimant has not established the requirements for lifting the stay or security to be ordered. According to Ecuador, it would suffer irreparable harm if the stay would be lifted or security ordered. In this respect, Ecuador points out that it is a developing nation with a dollarized economy without control of its own currency. Hence, Ecuador cannot create immediate liquidity to satisfy non-budgetary expenses. Ecuador refers to its efforts over the last decade to reduce economic and social inequality notwithstanding financial pressure from the falling oil price and to arbitral awards with which Ecuador has complied. Ecuador also refers to the devastating effects and economic consequences of the earthquake suffered in 2016. Ecuador points out that the amount of the Award represents 9% of the international reserves in its Central Bank and a substantial percentage of its budget for health and education.\n\n22.\n\nEcuador contends that escrowing the funds due under the Award would cause Ecuador the same harm as that which would be caused by lifting the stay, given the large amount awarded, security would come at a high cost for Ecuador; banks may be unwilling to provide a guarantee without a deposit of most or all of the amount in an account with the bank concerned. Ecuador considers defamatory the argument of Burlington that the unconditional stay would give Ecuador time to secure its assets. Ecuador also takes issue with Burlington's argument that such stay would provide Ecuador with a loan at minimal cost. According to Ecuador, Burlington's argument ignores that Burlington's \"rights over such money [of the Award] are legally qualified by Ecuador's right to seek annulment of the Award.\"9 Furthermore, it constitutes an attempt to re-litigate the issue of the interest rate decided by the Tribunal.\n\nResponse, para. 72.\n\n23.\n\nEcuador argues that Burlington has failed to establish that it suffers harm because of the stay due to delayed enforcement and increase in costs. Ecuador points out that, under the Convention, Burlington does not have a \"right\" to immediate enforcement during the pendency of the annulment proceedings10 and procedural delays in general cannot be blamed on Ecuador. Moreover, the delay in enforcement will be remedied by compounded post-award interest and the high-level cost of the proceedings for Burlington is a matter of its own making.\n\n*Id.*, para. 76.\n\n24.\n\nEcuador contests Burlington's arguments alleging possible non-compliance with the Award. According to Ecuador, it is never appropriate to grant security when the award creditor raises non-compliance as an argument for security because any risk of non-compliance is accounted for in the Convention; ad hoc committees are limited to the control of the award and their competence does not extend to decide a case of State responsibility under international law. Ecuador submits that to grant security exceeds the counterbalancing of the alleged effect of a stay, and it places the award creditor in a better situation. Furthermore, there is no proof presented that Burlington's prospect of enforcement will deteriorate during these proceedings.\n\n25.\n\nEcuador addresses the circumstances adduced by Burlington to demonstrate a risk of non compliance. First, Burlington ignores Ecuador's exemplary record of compliance with awards.\n\n26.\n\nSecond, the allegation that Ecuador has converted the ICSID annulment remedy into an appeal is incorrect and does not establish that Ecuador will not comply with the award. Ecuador explains that Burlington ignores that Ecuador did not request annulment in Duke and complied with its monetary obligations. Annulment is a remedy available under the Convention, Burlington has not proven that Ecuador has used this remedy improperly. Furthermore, the fact that Ecuador has sought to set aside four awards rendered in ad hoc arbitrations is irrelevant because the ICSID framework is different and Burlington does not prove that the \"set-aside actions were motivated by anything other than Ecuador's strong belief that the underlying awards were wrong as a matter of law.\"11\n\n*Id.*, para. 127.\n\n27.\n\nThird, Burlington does not explain how Ecuador's dissatisfaction and distrust towards the ICSID system would be indicative of a risk of non-compliance, none of the statements cited by Burlington advocate non-compliance with international obligations or the Award; Burlington overlooks statements from Ecuador reaffirming that it will continue to abide by international law. In fact, when the cited statements were made, Ecuador \"continued to make payment under awards adverse to it, and also concluded settlement negotiations and made settlement payments in relation to other investment arbitrations.\"12 In any case, none of such statements are binding on Ecuador.\n\n*Id.*, para. 139.\n\n28.\n\nFourth, the reliance of Burlington on Ecuador's denunciation of the ICSID Convention is misplaced because withdrawal from the Convention is irrelevant to the issue of enforcement, and Ecuador has continued to participate in all ongoing ICSID arbitrations and complied with the only adverse ICSID award issued after Ecuador denounced the Convention in 2009.\n\n29.\n\nFifth, Burlington's reliance on Ecuador's termination of its BITs is equally misplaced because the process of denunciation is irrelevant to enforcement of ICSID awards, this process is in compliance with international law, and the U.S.-Ecuador BIT remains effective for ten years.\n\n30.\n\nSixth, it is also misplaced the reliance of Burlington on CAITISA. The report prepared by this commission does not advocate non-compliance with international awards.\n\n31.\n\nSeventh, Ecuador contests as unfounded the suggestion of Burlington that Ecuador took steps to make enforcement outside Ecuador more difficult.\n\n32.\n\nEighth, Ecuador argues that the fact that it did not comply with provisional measures in the *Burlington* and *Perenco* proceedings does not establish that it will not comply with the Award. Ecuador affirms that decisions on provisional measures are not binding and points out that Burlington fails to explain how Ecuador's past non-observance of non-binding recommendations indicates its intention not to comply with the Award in the future if it is not annulled.\n\n33.\n\nNinth, Ecuador advises the Committee to disregard consideration of *Chevron III* \"without full knowledge of the elaborate and intricate proceedings surrounding the case. This is buttressed by the fact that the first, second, third and fourth interim awards, together with the first partial award, are subject to an application for annulment in The Hague.\"13\n\n*Id.*, para. 177.\n\n34.\n\nEcuador requests as relief that:\n\n*\"i. the stay be continued;*\n\n*ii. Burlington's request for the posting of security be dismissed; and*\n\n*iii. Burlington bear all the costs arising from the request to lift the stay, including all costs and fees and Ecuador's costs and expenses incurred in connection thereto, in amounts to be specified, with interest.\"14*\n\n*Id.*, para. 182.\n\n*d. Burlington's Reply*\n-----------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, \"The right to seek annulment of a final award within the ICSID system is not synonymous with the right to an indefinite and unconditional stay of enforcement of that final award.\"15 According to the Claimant, Ecuador has not proven that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify the continuation of the stay of enforcement, and its ability to comply with the Award or post security derives in part from the benefit accruing to Ecuador from the Claimant's expropriated assets. The Claimant recalls that annulment committees have considered hardship in the context of the provision of security only when it would have \"'catastrophic' immediate and irreversible consequences for [a party's] ability to conduct its affairs.\"16\n\nReply, para. 2.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Interim Order No. 1 on Guinea's Application for Stay of Enforcement of the Award (August 12, 1988) (\"*MINE v. Guinea*\") (AALA-16), para. 27.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant also recalls that Ecuador has ignored Burlington's alternative offers to security, namely, to place the Award amount in escrow or to escrow any collected funds if the stay would be lifted. The Claimant disputes that security would stifle the right to seek annulment since the stay of enforcement is not the purpose or a necessary component of an annulment proceeding, it is \"a discretionary possibility\".17\n\nReply, para. 11.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant is not persuaded by the list of 18 annullable errors in the Award alleged by the Respondent, and asserts that such number of errors in a single award is indicative of a frivolous application. The Claimant argues that there is a high risk of non-compliance by Ecuador after this annulment phase as shown by Ecuador's \"denouncing the Convention, describing the international arbitration system as inherently corrupt, refusing to comply with the Tribunal's orders, and raising routine challenges to virtually every award rendered against it. Even more telling is Ecuador's refusal to commit\u2014in this case, to this Committee\u2014to paying the Award promptly and in full.\"18\n\n*Id.*, para. 13.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the continuation of the stay is not automatic and depends on specific circumstances to be proven by the party requesting the continuation. The Claimant disputes Ecuador's assertion that the Committee has no authority to impose conditions on the stay. According to the Claimant, the discretionary power of an annulment committee under the ICSID Convention permits it to grant, deny or condition a stay request. The Claimant adduces case law confirming this possibility as an appropriate way to balance the interests of the parties.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant contends that contrary to Ecuador's argument, the posting of security will not place the Claimant in a better position: \"security would merely ensure that payment will be forthcoming if the Award is upheld, and thereby restore Burlington to the position that, under the ICSID Convention, it should already occupy: a position of confidence that a State bound by that Convention will comply with its obligations under a final ICSID award.\"19\n\n*Id.*, para. 31.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant disputes Ecuador's characterization of security as a penalty for seeking annulment. According to the Claimant, \"The Committee would not be taking anything away from Ecuador, for the simple reason that Ecuador has no right to a permanent stay during annulment proceedings. Indeed, Ecuador's right to seek annulment 'cannot operate against the presumption of validity of awards rendered under the ICSID Convention.'\"20 The Claimant contests the relevance of the fact that Ecuador's law expressly requires the posting of security as a precondition to stay enforcement and affirms that whether the Committee has the authority to order security is a matter of interpretation of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Id.*, para. 32.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant reaffirms its argument that Ecuador will profit from delayed enforcement since \"it would allow Ecuador to effectively borrow from Burlington at the low interest rate provided in the Award (far lower than its own cost of borrowing)\"21; and unless and until the Award is annulled, the Claimant have an uncontested right to the funds. The Claimant concludes that the stay of enforcement is the exception and \"[a]ny delayed payment in the absence of appropriate security would therefore allow Ecuador to take improper advantage of the ICSID system to Burlington's detriment.\"22\n\n*Id.*, para. 34.\n\n*Id.*, para. 35.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that Ecuador has not shown that the termination of the stay would have \"catastrophic, immediate and irreversible\" consequences. The Claimant observes that Ecuador's main argument is that security would be prejudicial because of the country's budgetary constraints. In this respect, the Claimant points out that the unlawful expropriation has been \"wildly profitable\" for Ecuador and the full amount of the Award has been ordered to be paid, whether it is paid now or \"when the annulment application is rejected does not change the fact that those sums must be paid and cannot be used for other government expenditures.\"23\n\n*Id.*, para. 42.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant further notes that Ecuador has not addressed the irreversibility of the alleged catastrophe. The Claimant draws attention to the fact that its primary relief request is for the escrowing of funds to be disbursed only upon the resolution of the annulment proceeding and to its undertaking that if the Committee \"orders the lifting of the stay and Burlington succeeds in enforcing involuntary payment while Ecuador's annulment application remains pending, Burlington would also place all such funds into an escrow account, to be returned to Ecuador if its annulment application is successful.\" Hence, there is no risk of anything irreversible happening upon the granting of either of Burlington's requests for relief.24\n\n*Id.*, para. 44.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimant points out that Ecuador's efforts at continuing the stay are undermined by its own admissions that it has not budgeted a reasonable sum to satisfy payment of the Award, that it does not have the liquidity to satisfy non-budgetary expenses, and that the number of awards against Ecuador have caused serious financial pressure. On this last point, the Claimant adds that Ecuador \"would write-in an exception to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention such that repeat violators of international law would, paradoxically, be exempt from immediately complying with awards against them.\"25\n\n*Id.*, para. 48\n\n45.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimant argues that it would be greatly prejudiced by the continuation of the stay because of the objective risk that Ecuador will not honor its commitments and this risk cannot be remedied by post-award interest, as argued by Ecuador. The Claimant disputes Ecuador's argument that the risk of non-compliance with the Award is not a legitimate consideration in determining whether security is appropriate. The Claimant adduces case law to the contrary and affirms that, whether Ecuador will comply with the Award is a central consideration in deciding whether to terminate or continue the stay with conditions. The Claimant explains that Ecuador refuses to commit to paying the Award promptly and in full, that it refused to comply with the Tribunal's orders on provisional measures in this case and in other proceedings, and that it announced that it would seek annulment of the Award when it received the Decision on Liability, that is five years before the Award was issued. The Claimant further explains that Ecuador has routinely resisted enforcement of international awards. After a review of cases, the Claimant affirms that \"Ecuador's 'track record' shows that it will not voluntarily comply with international awards, nor will it do so without delay as required by the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Thus, Burlington's concerns that Ecuador will engage in similar conduct in this case are well founded.\"26\n\n*Id.*, para. 61.\n\n46.\n\nIn support of its risk argument, the Claimant notes that Ecuador has systematically pursued annulment of arbitral awards rendered against it whether under the ICSID Convention or otherwise. According to the Claimant, Ecuador has improperly used the exceptional measure of annulment as a routine procedural step. Furthermore, Ecuador has denounced the ICSID regime and high-ranking officials, including the former president, have attacked the legitimacy of the ICSID system and international arbitration in general.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimant adduces as further evidence of disrespect for the ICSID system the formation of the \"Comisi\u00f3n para la Auditor\u00eda Integral Ciudadana de los Tratados de Protecci\u00f3n Rec\u00edproca de Inversiones y del Sistema de Arbitraje Internacional en Materia de Inversiones\" (\"CAITISA\"). The Claimant observes that Ecuador, as a former State party, is aware that the ICSID system is self-contained and precludes State parties from reviewing awards outside the remedies provided for in the ICSID Convention. The Claimant expresses its concern by rhetorically asking: \"following the inevitable determination of CAITISA that the Award is illegitimate, how could Ecuador, as a political matter, pay the Award?\"27 The Claimant also refers to Ecuador's Guide on BITs and submits that the content and tone of the Guide speak for themselves. The Claimant notes that the Guide lists \"social projects\" that Ecuador could accomplish instead of paying at least one arbitration award, an argument made in this proceeding in support for the continued stay of enforcement.\n\n*Id.*, para. 70.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimant reaffirms its request that the Committee: \"(1) reject the Republic of Ecuador's application to continue unconditionally the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, and instead (2) require Ecuador to post adequate financial security as a condition to continuing the stay; or (3) in the alternative, or in the event that Ecuador fails to comply with the Committee's instructions regarding the posting of security, lift the stay of enforcement.\"28\n\n*Id.*, para. 76.\n\n*e. Ecuador's Rejoinder*\n------------------------\n\n49.\n\nEcuador contends that to order posting of security is a provisional measure and annulment committees do not have the power to recommend, and certainly not to order, provisional measures: (a) because a tribunal requires a specific provision in its constituent instrument to empower it to make such order; (b) it is incorrect to affirm that the Committee has the implied power to order security because it has the power to maintain the stay since (i) to grant a stay only affects the intrinsic enforceability of an award and the power to order security is an injunction on the award debtor to do something and, therefore, the posting of security would be not less but more, and (ii) the posting of security would be economically similar to lifting the stay; and (c) the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law expressly provide for the possibility of ordering to provide security, and all articles of Chapter 4 of the ICSID Convention, but for Article 47 of the Convention, are expressly extended to annulment committees under Article 52(4).\n\n50.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, precedents can only be taken into consideration if they are convincing. Ecuador recalls why the Committee should dismiss those relied on by the Claimant as explained in its Response and observes that the Claimant has failed to respond to Ecuador's criticism of seven of the decisions. Ecuador further notes that security was requested in 20 of the 23 publicly available cases, but that it was actually ordered in nine instances only. Thus, it is not the overwhelming majority alleged by the Claimant.\n\n51.\n\nIn the alternative, if the Committee would consider that it has the power to order the posting of security, Ecuador affirms that stays have only been conditioned in extraordinary circumstances because the posting of security would place the Claimant in a better position in respect of the enforcement of the Award. Ecuador recalls that in the Response it explained that \"escrowing the funds would cause Ecuador the same harm as that which would be caused by lifting the stay, as it would result in the funds being frozen, and thus made unavailable for Ecuador's social development.\"29 As to the risk of Ecuador not being able to recoup funds paid in satisfaction of the Award, Ecuador points out that its \"Response did not posit such a risk, and thus Burlington's comments on recoupment are entirely irrelevant.\"30\n\nRejoinder, quoted in para. 47.\n\n*Id.*, para. 49.\n\n52.\n\nEcuador contests the arguments of Claimant to diminish the harm that Ecuador would suffer should the stay of enforcement be lifted. First, Ecuador points out that there is no support for the Claimant's interpretation that \"the catastrophic, immediate and irreversible consequences for Ecuador's ability to conduct its affairs described by the *MINE* committee must mean a crisis for the State in question\".31 Ecuador presents a table to show the impact of awards as a percentage of GDP of the country concerned in the year of the stay decision. The table lists 22 awards against States in which stays have continued without security; in all but three of them the Award represents a smaller percentage of Ecuador's GDP. Ecuador argues that \"this numerical analysis makes it very clear that the harm necessary to justify the continuation of a stay cannot be the descent into crisis of the relevant State.\"32\n\n*Id.*, para. 52.\n\n*Id.*, para. 53.\n\n53.\n\nSecond, Ecuador finds support in *Mitchell* for its argument about the significance of the Award amount in terms of the budgets for paying health and education professionals. Ecuador refers the Committee to its achievements in reduction of poverty and social inequality as a result of considerable social spending. Ecuador points out that the amount of the Award represents 28% of Ecuador's annual budget for running hospitals or 22% of the country's annual budget for all investment in new social projects. Thus, the effect of lifting the stay or ordering security would be catastrophic, immediate and irreversible for the Ecuadorians affected and Ecuador. According to Ecuador, \"What is at stake, in Burlington's application to lift the stay of enforcement, is whether that catastrophic, immediate and irreversible consequences should be imposed before the legal basis for them has become final and binding.\"33 The *Oxy II* arbitration is a case in point: \"To allow the stay in that case to have been lifted would have resulted in immense harm to Ecuador, as it would have been forced to pay over USD 700 million, and so divert such sum from its development, when there was no need to do so.\"34\n\n*Id.*, para. 63.\n\n*Id.*, para. 64.\n\n54.\n\nThird, Ecuador replies to the Claimant's understanding that Ecuador has the resources to comply with the Award. Ecuador considers this understanding irrelevant because \"the question is not whether Ecuador could pay the Award, but rather, what would be the consequences of doing so before its Application for Annulment is resolved.\"35 Ecuador points out that the Claimant incurs in contradiction where elsewhere it claims that Ecuador has stated being unable to create the necessary liquidity to pay the Award and affirms that, \"as a dollarized economy, it cannot print money like nations that control their own currency, and therefore that the payment of a large arbitral award necessarily involves reassigning funds from elsewhere in the State budget.\"36\n\n*Id.*, para. 65.\n\n*Id.*, para. 66.\n\n55.\n\nFourth, Ecuador contests the Claimant's argument that Ecuador cannot seriously argue that payment of multiple awards causes serious financial pressure on Ecuador. Ecuador asserts that \"such pressure is real, and clearly relevant to the straitened circumstances in which the Ecuadorian government must operate when striving to achieve its social goals.\"37\n\n*Id.*, para. 68.\n\n56.\n\nFifth, Ecuador disputes that it considers the requirement to post security a punishment.\n\n57.\n\nSixth, Ecuador recalls that the Claimant's right over the Award amount is qualified by Ecuador's right to seek annulment of the Award and the analogy of the loan advanced by the Claimant is not apposite for an arbitral award.\n\n58.\n\nSeventh, as regards whether the Claimant would be in a better position if security is ordered, Ecuador observes that the Claimant has not addressed the authorities cited by Ecuador or that reliance by the Claimant on the decision of *Standard Chartered* was mistaken because of the nature of the award debtor.\n\n59.\n\nEcuador disputes the relevance of the comments of the Claimant on the revenues generated to Ecuador by Blocks 7 and 21 because, if the Claimant prevails, it will most certainly seek to collect on any asset owned by Ecuador. The Claimant assumes that its production sharing contract for Block 7 would have been extended beyond its expiry in July 2010, and overlooks the significant investments and costs required to generate Petroamazonas' revenue.\n\n60.\n\nEcuador argues that the Claimant has not met its burden to prove that, in the words of the *Oxy II* annulment committee, its \"rights to enforce the Award [...] have actually deteriorated or that there is a risk that they will deteriorate in the future.\"38 Furthermore, the Claimant's willingness to place funds collected in escrow should the stay be lifted shows that it has no need for the funds. Therefore, the Claimant will not suffer prejudice and the delay because of the enforcement stay will be compensated by the post-award interest if the Award is not annulled.\n\n*Id.*, para. 81 quoting para. 96 of the Oxy II Decision.\n\n61.\n\nEcuador contends that it has continuously complied with its obligations; it complied with four adverse awards and settled in four arbitrations where the claimant prevailed. Ecuador insists that it complied with the *Chevron II* award to Chevron's satisfaction, disputes that post-award settlement negotiations do not constitute compliance with its international obligations, explains that payment of the *Oxy II* and *Chevron II* awards were motivated by the fact that non-compliance would have serious consequences for Ecuador being perceived as a country non-compliant with its international obligations, and explains that the interim measures ordered in the *Chevron III* arbitration are currently subject to set-aside proceedings in The Hague.\n\n62.\n\nEcuador argues that the Claimant cannot request the lifting of the stay or security on an alleged risk of non-compliance. Ecuador insists that provisional measures under the ICSID Convention are not binding and therefore non-compliance with provisional measures was not a violation of Ecuador's international law obligations. Ecuador explains that its Annulment Application is not frivolous and asserts that it exercised its right under Article 52 in \"a prudent, non-abusive and good faith manner.\"39 Furthermore, it should not be surprising that Ecuador announced Ecuador's intention to challenge the Award shortly after it received it since it has been aware of the legal flaws in the Tribunal's conclusions for four years.\n\n*Id.*, para. 105.\n\n63.\n\nEcuador addresses the parallel drawn by the Claimant between this proceeding and the *Oxy II* annulment proceeding based on the large number of alleged grounds for annulment. Ecuador affirms: \"It is undisputed that the *Oxy II* committee partially annulled the underlying award, which led to a record reduction in the amount of damages awarded to the investor (of 40%). Ecuador was thus proven right by the *Oxy II* committee, irrespective of the number of grounds for annulment invoked in that case.\"40\n\n*Id.*, para. 111.\n\n64.\n\nEcuador argues that, \"There is no relation between the legal remedies that Ecuador may, in good faith, choose to avail itself of in unrelated proceedings involving third parties and the likelihood that Ecuador will comply with the Award.\"41 Ecuador confirms that Petroecuador complied with the award in the *Repsol YPF* case.\n\n*Id.*, para. 116.\n\n65.\n\nEcuador disputes the relevance of public statements by Ecuadorian officials expressing dissatisfaction with investment treaty arbitration. Ecuador explains that only the President and the Chancellor may make statements that bind the State. Ecuador equally disputes the relevance that it lawfully denounced the ICSID Convention and terminated investment treaties.\n\n66.\n\nEcuador argues that the Claimant mischaracterizes CAITISA: The *Oxy II* annulment committee did not consider that CAITISA contributed to showing that there was a risk that Ecuador would not comply with the award. Ecuador affirms that the position of the Claimant is based on speculative unsupported hypotheses, CAITISA's mission has been fulfilled, CAITISA did not recommend that Ecuador not comply with its international obligations.\n\n67.\n\nEcuador re-affirms its request for relief.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n----------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Committee will address first the legal framework applicable to the stay of enforcement; burden of proof; proportionality; whether the stay of enforcement should be continued; if continued, whether it should be subject to conditions and whether the Committee has the power to attach them to its decision on the stay; and if the answers are in the affirmative, the conditions that should be attached.\n\n*a. The Legal Framework*\n------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules are reproduced here for convenience.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"*\n\nRule 54 of the Arbitration Rules reads as follows:\n\n*\"(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\n\n*(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.*\n\n*(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or**continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall**automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an**award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).*\n\n*(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\"*\n\n70.\n\nAccording to Article 52(5), the Committee has to appreciate first whether circumstances are present that make it necessary to stay enforcement or continue the provisional stay of enforcement. Once the Committee has concluded that such circumstances exist, then it *may* decide in favor or against the continuation of the stay. The Committee emphasizes the term \"may\" because even when the required circumstances are present, a committee may decide against the continuation of the stay of enforcement. This wide discretion of the Committee in making its decision is compounded by the unspecified nature of the circumstances that may lead an annulment committee to conclude that they require that enforcement be stayed.42\n\n\"There have been a total of 43 requests for the stay of enforcement in the 90 registered annulments, 41 of which have led to Committee decisions. Thirty-six decisions granted the stay of enforcement. In 22 of those instances where a stay was granted, it was conditioned upon the issuance of some type of security or written undertaking. In 11 of those 22 cases, the stay was terminated because the condition had not been satisfied.\" *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID* (May 5, 2016) (\"*ICSID Background Paper*\") (ARLA-29). The Committee notes that, based on the information publicly available and as of the date of the Updated Background Paper, stays were ultimately not maintained in 15 out of 41 decisions, including the 11 cases in which the stay was lifted later because of non-compliance with its conditions. The Committee also notes that up to 2012 all stay requests were granted. It is only during the last six years that stay continuation requests have been denied in five publicly known cases.\n\n71.\n\nThe Parties agree that the stay of enforcement is not automatic and that the Committee has discretion in granting it. The Parties disagree on whether, at this stage, a *prima facie* test may be applied by the Committee to the merit of the Application for Annulment. The Committee clarifies at the outset that, at this early stage of the proceeding, it is unable to apply such test. The Parties also disagree on whether the conditions for lifting the stay and for ordering security are the same. According to Burlington, the condition is for both, primarily, whether there is a risk that Ecuador will not comply promptly and fully with the Award43, whereas Ecuador, while disagreeing with the premise that the conditions are the same, argues that neither can be ordered because it would cause Ecuador immediate and irreparable harm.44 The Parties further disagree on the gravity of the hardship a state must suffer (as a result of the lifting of the stay or by the posting of security) in order to continue the stay without security. They also disagree on whether the Committee has the power to condition a stay of enforcement.\n\nOpposition, para. 5.\n\nResponse, para. 46.\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee recalls that while a party to a dispute may request the annulment of an award, it has no right to the annulment. Similarly, the party requesting annulment may request a stay of enforcement but it has no right to the stay. On the other hand, both parties to the dispute are obliged to abide by an award notwithstanding an annulment proceeding. As stated by the *Standard Chartered* committee: \"the obligation that each State assumed on ratification of the Convention, under Article 53, to comply with awards against it is particularly important. This obligation is *as important* as the right to pursue annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. These two articles are linked together.\"45\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay on Enforcement of the Award (April 12, 2017) (ARLA-15), para. 84. Emphasis added.\n\n73.\n\nIn sum, the stay of enforcement is an exception in the context of the remedy of annulment that is itself limited and exceptional.46\n\n\"The limited and exceptional nature of the annulment remedy expressed in the drafting history of the Convention has been repeatedly confirmed by ICSID Secretary-Generals in Reports to the Administrative Council of ICSID, papers and lectures.\" *ICSID Background Paper*, *supra* n.42, para. 73.\n\n*b. Burden of Proof*\n--------------------\n\n74.\n\nEcuador did not justify the request for staying the enforcement of the Award at the time of filing its Request for Annulment and the Claimant opposed it outright. Only in its Response did Ecuador explain the circumstances that might justify the continuation of the stay, and even then only as part of an argument intended to show the failure of Burlington to establish the legal requirements for conditioning the continuation of the stay. This reversal of the burden of proof of the circumstances that justify the continuation of a stay of enforcement under the terms of ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(4) is not acceptable.\n\n75.\n\nRule 54(4) provides that a request for a stay of enforcement \"shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\" This rule is clear in that the party that requests the stay carries the burden of proof of the circumstances that would justify the stay or its continuation. Ecuador requested the stay of enforcement and its continuation. If the stay were not continued, it would terminate automatically under Rule 54(2). Hence, it is for Ecuador, as requesting party, to prove that circumstances exist that require the stay to be continued.\n\n76.\n\nOn the other hand, it is Claimant's burden to prove that there are circumstances that warrant to attach conditions to the stay. In sum, each Party has to prove the circumstances on which it bases its claims.\n\n*c. Proportionality*\n--------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn the opening statement at the hearing, Ecuador recalled that the Committee needs to apply a proportionality test, \"To justify the continuance of the Stay, Ecuador, Members of the Committee, must show that lifting the Stay will cause serious and irreversible circumstances in comparison with the consequence for Burlington of continuing the Stay, and the Committee must balance this interest to determine in the end whether to continue the Stay or not. And this is precisely the proportionality test I referred to at the beginning of our Opening Statement.\"47 The Claimant opposes the application of such test. When prompted at the hearing by Ecuador's counsel because he had not addressed the proportionality argument in his statement, counsel for the Claimant stated: \"to the extent there is a proportionality analysis--and we've explained why that's not the legal standard--we certainly should have the ability to not allow their position to get better in the interim if we're going to have that enforcement fight.\"48 In its Reply, the Claimant had argued that \"Ecuador's arguments concerning the relative prejudice that each side would face were the Committee to grant the relief requested by Burlington confounds the legal framework governing awards under the ICSID Convention.\"49 According to the Claimant, the default rule under the ICSID Convention is that awards are enforceable immediately and in the cases when annulment is requested, an exceptional remedy, the annulment committee may stay the award if the circumstances so require. Furthermore, any considerations raised by Ecuador to justify the stay must be balanced against factors such as the prospect of compliance, the risk of non-recovery, the risk of irreparable harm to either party and the dilatory character of the request for annulment.\n\nTranscript p. 33, lines 14-22.\n\n*Id.*, p. 203, lines 1-6.\n\nReply, para. 36.\n\n78.\n\nAs stated at the beginning of this analysis, the first step for the Committee is to determine whether circumstances exist that would require the continuation of the stay. Such circumstances are to be considered by themselves and to be proven by the party requesting the continuation of the stay. If the determination is favorable to the continuation of the stay, then the Committee may consider other factors such as those argued by the Claimant. In the view of the Committee, \"proportionality\" is not an additional step in the Committee's analysis, the latter to be based only on the circumstances proven by the applicant. If the Committee were to find that the circumstances pled are not proven, proportionality cannot compensate for the lack of proof of the circumstances that would require the continuation of the stay.\n\n*d. Are There Circumstances that Require the Stay of Enforcement?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe only circumstance that Ecuador has invoked to justify the continuation of the stay (and only in its Response), is that the lifting of the stay now would cause hardship; it would have \"'catastrophic' immediate and irreversible\" consequences in the words of the *MINE* annulment committee.50 The Committee shall therefore concentrate its analysis on this circumstance. For the Claimant, the applicable standard for hardship means that the State must \"enter into financial collapse, deep economic recession, or social and economic crisis\" as a result of payment of the Award amount or posting of security. According to Ecuador, such interpretation would mean that hardly any stay would be continued contrary to the general practice of annulment committees.\n\n*MINE v. Guinea*, *supra* n.16, para. 27.\n\n80.\n\nEcuador has based its arguments on the significance of the Award amount in terms of its budget for paying health and education professionals. Ecuador has emphasized that it has a history of poverty and economic inequality which it is striving to change. Ecuador affirms that \"[u]niversal access to healthcare and education are crucial levers for eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable improvement in the quality of life of the population. That is why paying an amount equivalent to, *inter alia*, 28% of Ecuador's annual budget for running hospitals or 22% of the country's annual budget for all investment in new social projects [\u2026] would be catastrophic.\"51 Ecuador as part of its hardship argument has adduced its dollarized economy and the financial pressures brought upon the country by the 2016 earthquake, the falling oil price and the effect of paying various arbitral awards. As regards the consequences of the earthquake, Ecuador has requested that \"special consideration should be given to the fact that the needs of the people of Ecuador are currently especially acute. In 2016, Ecuador suffered a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that killed more than 650 people and injured more than 16,600. In this context, healthcare is of paramount importance - as is the availability of funding for the government's plan to rehouse the 1,600 families still living in shelters.\"52 The fall of oil prices has resulted in a reduction of Ecuador's revenues and of its budget by 17%.\n\nRejoinder, para. 60.\n\nResponse, para. 57.\n\n81.\n\nEven if the type of circumstances that may require a stay of enforcement on grounds of hardship need not necessarily be of the magnitude argued by the Claimant, the facts adduced by Ecuador are not of the severity that the other annulment committees on which Ecuador relied have taken into account. The consequences described by Ecuador do not match the scarcity of foreign exchange in Guinea in the case of *MINE* or the instability in DRC, a country ravaged by war, in the case of *Mitchell*. Ecuador bases its argument on the need to make choices to allocate its scarce dollar funds. The Committee is not persuaded by this argument, particularly because the assets subject of the underlying arbitration generate substantial revenues in foreign exchange for Ecuador.53\n\nReply, para. 43.\n\n82.\n\nEcuador has also drawn to the attention of the Committee the negative consequences causing irreparable harm that payment of the Award prior to the Decision on Annulment would have on Ecuador, should the Award be annulled. The Claimant offered to open an escrow account to deposit any funds collected before the decision on the Request for Annulment. The funds would be available to either party depending on whether the Award is or is not annulled.54 In its Rejoinder Ecuador commented that it was not concerned about recovery.55\n\nId., para. 44\n\nRejoinder, para. 49.\n\n83.\n\nThe Committee does not question the laudable social objectives pursued by Ecuador and is not in a position to comment from which budget allocation the State would reassign existing allocations to pay the Award. The argument that the termination of the stay would mean reallocation of funds within the budget is inherent to the need to satisfy any financial obligation by a State. It is a general argument that any State could make, which has been rejected in the past56 and which the Committee does not consider to establish the minimal gravity required to justify a continuation of the stay. A State budget includes funds allocated to many activities, and not only to social projects. It is for the State to determine its priorities and how they will be funded. Evidently, if the Committee does not annul the Award, Ecuador will be obliged to pay it in full irrespective of its budgetary consequences. It is not within the remit of an annulment committee to link the obligation to pay the Award to the effects on the budget of the State concerned.57\n\n\"In balancing the interests of the parties in these annulment proceedings the Committee considers, first, that aside from a general statement that lifting the stay would prevent Argentina from using funds that it otherwise needs to satisfy the needs of Argentinians, there is no concrete allegation, much less evidence, of the existence of special circumstances that merit extending the stay of enforcement.\" *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award (December 4, 2014) (ARLA-23), para. 104.\n\nIt is worth noting that the sentence from the *MINE* decision quoted by Ecuador on the catastrophic effect of the stay is preceded by a sentence on poverty and compliance. These two sentences read as follows: \"Poverty as such is not a circumstance justifying a stay any more than it would justify non-payment of an award. The criterion is, rather, whether termination of the stay would have what Guinea calls 'catastrophic' immediate and irreversible consequences for its ability to conduct its affairs.\" *MINE v. Guinea*, *supra* n.16, para. 27.\n\n84.\n\nFor mere completeness's sake, however, the Committee confirms that it has duly noted Ecuador's repeated reminders that it honors its international obligations, but also Ecuador's consistent failure, notwithstanding Burlington's repeated requests, to commit specifically to, promptly and in full, comply with the Award if it is not annulled.58 The Committee furthermore disagrees with Ecuador's concept of compliance, which includes post-award negotiations and a settlement, including a cut in the amount awarded by a tribunal. While it is up to parties to negotiate a settlement if they find it convenient, it is not what compliance means under the ICSID Convention.\n\nFor instance, in para. 74 of the Rejoinder, the Respondent states: \"The shortcomings of Burlington's 'earmark' argument are even more evident when one considers that, if Burlington prevails in this annulment proceeding, it will most certainly seek to collect on any asset owned by Ecuador - not just on revenues directly linked to Blocks 7 and 21.\" The idea that if Burlington prevails Ecuador will pay promptly the Award without the Claimant's need to seek to collect on any asset owned by Ecuador is absent from the quoted statement.\n\n85.\n\nThe Committee finds that Ecuador has failed to prove that the termination of the stay would lead to severe consequences for its ability to conduct its affairs. This is the only circumstance pled by Ecuador that required the continuation of the stay of enforcement. As stated earlier, the first step for the Committee is to determine whether circumstances exist that would require the continuation of the stay. If the party requesting the continuation of the stay does not prove that such circumstances exist, then this should be the end of the matter. The Committee is of the view that security is not a substitute for lack of circumstances that require the stay, to proceed otherwise would be contrary to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n86.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Committee concludes that the provisional stay of the enforcement of the Award should be lifted. This conclusion makes unnecessary to deal with the subject, heavily debated between the Parties, regarding the Committee's authority to condition the continuation of the stay on Ecuador's posting of a security, as requested by Claimant. In light of this conclusion, the Parties may wish to revisit Burlington's offer to open an escrow account where Burlington would deposit any funds collected from Ecuador during the annulment proceedings and would be readily available to Ecuador if the Award were annulled.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n87.\n\nEcuador has requested that all costs related to the continuation or termination of the stay, including its fees and expenses, be borne by the Claimant. The Committee has decided to reserve its decision for a later stage when it has an overview of the full proceeding.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n88.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Committee has decided to terminate the provisional stay, reserve its decision on costs and dismiss all other requests."}]}
