In this order, the Tribunal will resolve these divergences and determine the rules on transparency and confidentiality applicable to this arbitration. For this purpose, it will first focus on the legal framework (A). Then it will review the divergences in respect of the elements of the proceedings to be disclosed (B) and of the exceptions to disclosure (C). The applicable transparency/confidentiality rules are reproduced in Annex I.\n\n**A. L****egal** **F****ramework**\n----------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nArticle 44 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[i]f any question of procedure arises which is not covered by the [Convention] or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question\". It is undisputed that the transparency/confidentiality of the proceedings are matters of procedure. Accordingly, the Tribunal has the power to set rules on transparency/confidentiality where the applicable legal framework contains no such rules and the Parties have not reached an agreement.1\n\nOther tribunals have also held that setting the proceeding's transparency/confidentiality regime falls within the powers of the Tribunal. See *Abaclat and others (formerly Giovanna a Beccara and others) v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Procedural Order No. 3 (Confidentiality Order), 27 January 2010 (\"*Abaclat v. Argentina*\"), \u00b6\u00b6 73; *Rand Investments Ltd. and others v. Republic of Serbia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/8, Procedural Order No. 5, 29 August 2019 (\"*Rand Investments v. Serbia*\"), \u00b6 27.\n\n7.\n\nThe legal framework applicable to these proceedings is determined by the China-Sweden BIT (the \"BIT\"), the ICSID Convention, and 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules. It is common ground between the Parties that the BIT is silent with respect to transparency/confidentiality, and its well established that neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules impose a general duty in favor or against transparency/confidentiality.2\n\nSee *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3, 29 September 2006 (\"*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*\"), \u00b6 121; *Abaclat v. Argentina*, \u00b6\u00b6 77-79; *United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24, Decision on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 12 May 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 80-83; *Rand Investments v. Serbia*, \u00b6 27.\n\n8.\n\nThis being so, the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules contain some provisions relevant to the case at hand. Article 48(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the \"Centre shall not publish the award without the consent of the parties\". To that end, ICSID Arbitration Rule 48(4) states that \"[t] he Centre shall not publish the award without the consent of the parties\", adding that \"[t]he Centre shall, however, promptly include in its publications excerpts of the legal reasoning of the Tribunal\". For its part, ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(2) stipulates that \"[u]nless either party objects, the Tribunal, after consultation with the Secretary-General, may allow other persons, besides the parties, their agents, counsel and advocates, witnesses and experts during their testimony, and officers of the Tribunal, to attend or observe all or part of the hearings, subject to appropriate logistical arrangements\". These provisions are addressed to ICSID and the Tribunal, not to the Parties. Be that as it may, here the Parties agree that ICSID may publish the Award (subject to the redaction of protected information)3 and that the hearings will be closed to the public unless otherwise agreed by the Parties subsequently.4\n\nParties' joint comments to Draft PO1, 5 July 2022, \u00a7 24; Parties' joint comments to Draft PO2, 9 August 2022, \u00b6 6 (with no objection by either Party); Respondent's email of 9 August 2022 (\"Sweden [has] consented (subject to the process described in Section III of [Draft PO2]) to the publication of the Award[\u2026]\"); Claimant's communication of 26 August 2022, p. 2 (\"The Claimant takes this opportunity to reiterate that [it] consents to the publication of the award.\").\n\nParties' joint comments to Draft PO1, 5 July 2022, \u00a7 21.2; PO1, \u00a7 21.2.\n\n9.\n\nBy contrast, the relevant legal framework contains no rule on the publication of decisions and procedural orders, transcripts/recordings of the hearings,5 written submissions, and supporting documents (i.e., exhibits, witness statements, and expert reports). This being so, the Parties concur to say that supporting documents shall not be made public, unless they agree otherwise.6 Accordingly, there is neither a rule nor an agreement between the Parties in respect of the transparency/confidentiality of decisions and procedural orders, transcripts/recordings of hearings, and written submissions, with the result that the Tribunal must make a determination on the disclosure of these procedural categories.7\n\nThe 2006 version of ICSID's Administrative and Financial Regulations (\"(2006) Regulations\") established, in Regulation 22(2)(c), that, \"[i]f both parties to a proceeding consent[ed] to the publication of [\u2026] the minutes and other records of proceedings, the Secretary-General shall arrange for the publication thereof, in an appropriate form with a view to furthering the development of international law in relation to investments\". However, (2006) Regulation 22(2)(c) stopped being applicable once the 2022 version of the Regulations came into force on 1 July 2022 (\"(2022) Regulations\"). Notably, (2022) Regulation 25, which replaced (2006) Regulation 22, no longer conditions the publication of the transcripts/recordings by ICSID to the consent of the parties. Rather, (2022) Regulation 25 simply states that, \"[w]ith a view to furthering the development of international law in relation to investment, the Centre shall publish: (a) information about the operation of the Centre; and (b) documents generated in proceedings, in accordance with the rules applicable to the individual proceeding\".\n\nParties' joint comments to Draft PO1, 5 July 2022, \u00a7 24; Parties' joint comments to Draft PO2, 9 August 2022, \u00b6 11 (with no objection by either Party).\n\nThe Claimant has sought to reiterate that \"it does not consent, at this stage, to making public [\u2026] the Tribunal's decisions and orders, the Parties' written submissions, [\u2026] and the hearing transcripts or recordings\" (Claimant's communication of 26 August 2022, p. 2). For the Claimant \"nothing [should] be made public absent consent of both Parties\" (Claimant's email of 9 August 2022). In turn, the Respondent \"consent[s] to the publication of Award, of hearing transcripts and recordings, of orders and decisions, and of written submissions\" (Respondent's email of 9 August 2022). For the Respondent the categories of documents in dispute ought to be published subject to the redaction process set out in Draft PO2 with which both Parties in principle agree (Respondent's communication of 1 September 2022, p. 4).\n\n10.\n\nDoing so, the Tribunal must balance, on the one hand, the public interest in disclosing a given category of information, and, on the other, the extent to which said disclosure may affect the integrity of the proceedings, aggravate the dispute, or infringe on either Party's due process rights. This balancing test is well established8 and, although in part implicitly, appears accepted by the Parties.9\n\nSee *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, \u00b6\u00b6 112, 149-161; *Abaclat v. Argentina*, \u00b6\u00b6 90-105; *Ipek Investment Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/18, Procedural Order No. 11, 21 February 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 17-21. See also (2022) Regulation 25, referring to the publication by ICSID of documents generated during the proceedings in accordance with the rules applicable thereto, \"[w]ith a view to furthering the development of international law in relation to investment\".\n\nSee Claimant's communication of 26 August 2022, p. 2 (\"It is well established that the interests of transparency in international arbitration must be balanced against the requirements of procedural integrity and the duty not to aggravate the dispute\"); Respondent's communication of 26 August 2022, p. 6 (\"For example, and unlike in past cases, Claimant has not contended that the publication of case documents would aggravate the dispute or undermine the proceeding.\").\n\n**B. C****ategories of information to be published or not**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nHaving weighed the relevant interests and subject to the redaction procedure set out in Section G of Annex 1, the Tribunal reaches the following conclusions for the reasons set out below:\n\ni. **Decisions**: The Parties have agreed on the publication of the Award and the Award will incorporate any decisions rendered in the course of the proceedings, with the result that one does not see the rationale for not publishing decisions. Further, like the Award, decisions will set out both Parties' positions, discuss the issues presented in an objective manner, and explain the reasons for the solution reached. There is thus no risk that one-sided information be published and that an incorrect or incomplete account of the dispute be given to the public, which could aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the proceedings. Moreover, the publication of decisions may serve the public interest of contributing towards the development of investment law.\n\nii. **Procedural orders**: The reasons justifying the publication of the Tribunal's decisions apply here *mutatis mutandis* in favor of the publication of procedural orders.\n\niii. **Written submissions**: Essentially, the reasons just set out in favor of the publication of decisions at the same time speak against the publication of written submissions. Submissions by definition advocate a position and do not give a balanced view of the dispute. They are not meant either to promote the development of the law. This being so, to the extent it is relevant to the resolution of the issues before the Tribunal, the content of the submissions will be addressed in the Award and in decisions.\n\niv. **Transcripts/recordings of the hearings**: As already noted, the ICSID Convention requires the express consent of the Parties to hold open hearings and the Parties here agree that the hearings will be closed to the public.10 It would thus be inconsistent to disseminate information about the content of closed hearings by way of the publication of transcripts or recordings. Similarly, since the Parties agree that witness statements and expert reports shall not be made public,11 it would be contrary to that common intent to disclose the oral testimony of witnesses and experts whose written evidence is treated as confidential. Publication could also give a distorted reflection of the evidence as only the cross and redirect examinations would become public and the evidence in chief would remain shielded. Moreover, the prospect of dissemination of the hearing records could prevent witnesses and experts from being candid while answering questions. This would be so even if the transcripts/recordings were published only at the same time as the Award, thereby impeding the establishment of the facts and affecting due process. Finally, the relevant facts as established at a hearing and otherwise will be set out in the Award.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 8.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 9.\n\n**C. E****xceptions to** **P****ublication**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nDraft PO2 provided for exceptions to the publication of information otherwise subject to disclosure by identifying grounds for non-publication and specifying a redaction process. The Parties agree on the latter, but their views diverge with respect to the former.\n\n13.\n\nSpecifically, PO2 provided for the redaction of \"[i]nformation protected from disclosure under the applicable domestic law of the Respondent, or under any law or rules determined by the Tribunal to be applicable to the disclosure of such information\".12 This wording was based on Article 7(2)(c) of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration.\n\nDraft PO2, \u00b6 12.iii.\n\n14.\n\nIn its comments to Draft PO2, the Claimant proposed the inclusion of the phrase \"or of the Claimant\" after the words \"domestic law of the Respondent\".13 It argued that the Respondent refused to agree to \"characterize as 'protected' for the purposes of these proceedings information protected from disclosure under Chinese law\".14 This, so said the Claimant, was a matter of concern \"given (i) the fact that it is a company incorporated in the People's Republic of China; and (ii) there are instances in which Chinese law may govern the disclosure of information\".15 For its part, the Respondent submitted that the Claimant's proposal \"seemed nonsensical\" because the Claimant had insisted that it was to be distinguished from the Chinese State.16 Sweden added that there was \"no such thing as the 'domestic law of the [company Huawei]'\",17 and it was unlikely that the Claimant would use the phrase 'or of the Claimant' to mean 'or of China'\".18\n\nParties' joint comments to Draft PO2, 9 August 2022, \u00b6 12.iii.\n\nClaimant's communication of 26 August 2022, p. 2.\n\n*Id*.\n\nRespondent's communication of 1 September 2022, p. 3.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n15.\n\nIn light of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal has reconsidered the wording suggested in Draft PO2. As a general matter and subject to there being a general principle of law or a transnational rule, the law applicable to the protection of information would be the one with the closest connection to the information at stake. In practice, this will most often be the law of the host State of the investment because the investment activities and the relevant actions of the State in relation to the investment are generally carried out there. However, there may be exceptions to this usual situation in which a closer connection exists to a jurisdiction other than the host State. Hence, rather than identifying a specific legal system, it seems preferable to frame the exception in more conceptual terms and leave it to the Tribunal to determine the applicable law considering all relevant circumstances. It goes without saying that the Parties would have an opportunity to present their views on the choice and content of the applicable law before the Tribunal makes a determination.\n\n**III.** **ORDER**\n------------------\n\n16.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal adopts the transparency/confidentiality rules set forth in Annex 1 to this procedural order.\n\n26 September 2022\n\n**A****nnex** **1** **to** **P****rocedural** **O****rder** **N****o****. 2 T****ransparency****/C****onfidentiality** **R****ules**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.

Protected information means information that is:\n\ni. Deemed as such by agreement of the Parties;\n\nii. Confidential business information or protected personal information;\n\niii. Information protected from disclosure under the law or rules determined by the Tribunal to be applicable to the disclosure of such information;\n\niv. Information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement;\n\nv. Information the disclosure of which would be contrary to the essential security interests of the Respondent; or\n\nvi. Information the disclosure of which would aggravate the dispute between the Parties or jeopardize the integrity of the arbitral process.\n\n9.\n\nWithin 30 days from the issuance of the Award, a decision and order (Sections C and D above), a Party shall give notice to the Tribunal and the other Party that it requests the non-disclosure of protected information in that document. Such notice shall identify the part(s) of the document sought not to be disclosed in the form of proposed redactions. Absent such notice and unless the Tribunal determines that compelling interests require information to be protected in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Annex, the Tribunal will authorize ICSID to publish the document without redactions.\n\n10.\n\nWithin 30 days from such notice, the other Party may raise reasoned objections to the requested protection and:\n\ni. If no objections are raised, ICSID will publish the document at issue with the requested redactions.\n\nii. If objections are raised, the Parties shall confer and seek to resolve the issue by agreement within 15 days. If the Parties reach an agreement, ICSID will publish the document at issue with the agreed redactions. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith in resolving any objections and it is the Tribunal's expectation that disputes will only be referred to it in exceptional circumstances.\n\niii. If objections remain unresolved, the disputed redaction requests and the objections thereto shall be submitted to the Tribunal in the form of the Transparency Schedule set out in Annex 2 to Procedural Order No. 2 (in both .docx and .pdf).\n\niv.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 27 July 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO1\") along with the Procedural Calendar.\n\n2.\n\nOn 13 February 2023, on the date provided in the Procedural Calendar, the Respondent filed its Notice of Intended Objections and Request for Bifurcation (the \"Request\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 27 February 2023, the Claimant filed its Response to the Request (the \"Response\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 13 March 2023, having considered the Parties' positions, the Tribunal denied the Request and informed the Parties that it would provide the reasons for its decision in due course, as anticipated in the Procedural Calendar. It also noted that the proceedings would continue under Scenario 2(b) of the Procedural Calendar.\n\n5.\n\nThis Procedural Order sets out the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decision denying bifurcation.\n\n**II. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. R****espondent****'****s** **P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the \"overarching consideration\" to decide on bifurcation is procedural efficiency.1 It notes that, to assess efficiency, tribunals have typically reviewed factors such as: (i) whether the jurisdictional objections are serious (as opposed to frivolous);2 (ii) whether such objections, if granted, have the potential of disposing or materially reducing the scope of the proceedings;3 and (iii) whether or not the issues that the objections raise are too intertwined with the merits.4\n\nRequest, \u00b6 37, quoting **RL-7**, *Emmis International Holding, B.V. et al. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, 13 June 2013, \u00b6 37(2); and **RL-8**, *The Carlyle Group L.P. and others v. Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/29, Procedural Order No. 4: Decision on Bifurcation, 20 January 2020, \u00b6 66.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 37.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 37.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 37.\n\n7.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot establish the \"basic threshold point\" of having made a protected investment in Sweden.5 The Respondent further argues that, even if the Claimant could identify a protected investment, its case \"turns on the notion that it was ousted improperly from the 'Swedish 5G market'\".6 Yet, the Respondent contends, the Claimant has not demonstrated that it holds any rights in respect of Sweden's 5G networks, nor has it shown, as the Sweden-China BIT (\"BIT\" or \"Treaty\") requires, that it was authorized to make 5G-related investments in Sweden.7\n\nRequest, \u00b6 15.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 15.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 17.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent therefore requests the bifurcation of the following two \"preliminary questions\":\n\n[...] whether or not Claimant has proven that it had any protected investment in Sweden at the time of the injury that the Claimant alleges; and\n\n[...] if so, whether or not Claimant has proven that any such investment included the rights underlying its claims.8\n\nRequest, \u00b6 11.\n\n9.\n\nFor the Respondent, these questions involve serious defects in the Claimant\u2019s case on jurisdiction9 and are \"cleanly separable from the merits\".10 Moreover, answering either question in the negative would dispose of the entire case11 and, hence, reduce the duration and cost of the arbitration.12\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39\n\nRequest, \u00b6 11. *See also*, Request, \u00b6 42.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 11. *See also*, Request, \u00b6 41.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n10.\n\nRegarding the first preliminary question on the lack of a protected investment in Sweden, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant\u2019s \"purported 'investment\u2019 in Sweden is a structured one\".13 While the Claimant itself is a Chinese entity (Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd or \"Huawei\"), it owns its alleged investment in Sweden (shares in Huawei Technologies Sweden AB or \"Huawei Sweden\") indirectly through a Dutch entity (Huawei Technologies Cooperatief U.A or \"Huawei NL\").14\n\nRequest, \u00b6 24.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 24, fn. 40.\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Treaty does not protect indirect investments by Chinese investors,15 and notes that the definition of \"investor\" in Article 1(2) of the BIT varies depending on the investor\u2019s nationality.16 A Swedish investor is defined as \"any individual who is a citizen of Sweden according to Swedish law as well as any legal person with its seat in Sweden or with a predominating Swedish interest\",17 and a Chinese investor as \"any company, other legal person or citizen of China authorized by the Chinese Government to make an investment\".18\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 20, fn. 38, quoting Article 1(2) of the BIT.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 22, quoting Article 1(2) of the BIT.\n\n12.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s argument that, by leaving out the notion of \"predominant\" ownership in the definition of Chinese investors, which appears in the definition of Swedish investors,19 the Treaty excludes Chinese investors from \"own[ing] a protected investment indirectly\".20 As such, the \"BIT does not extend to any assets that a Chinese entity [...] purports to own in Sweden indirectly\".21 Differently stated, for a Chinese investor, the \"only permitted investment structu[re]\" is a direct investment,22 which is not the situation here.23\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 25\n\nRequest, \u00b6 22.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 27.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 23.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 27.\n\n13.\n\nIn connection with the second preliminary question on the existence of the alleged rights underlying the claims, the Respondent stresses that the \"Claimant\u2019s case rests on the premise that it owned a very specific protected investment: a bundle of assets that included the categorical right for Huawei products to form part of the architecture of the New 5G Networks\".24 In this regard, the Respondent raises two arguments:\n\ni. The Claimant has not established that such a right exists.25 During the past decade, Huawei Sweden allegedly entered into supply contracts for 3G and 4G with Swedish mobile network operators (\"mNos\").26 Although 5G constitutes a marked evolution from its predecessor technologies, the Claimant has not filed the frame contracts that it allegedly concluded with certain MNOs concerning the 5G networks.27 In any event, even if the Claimant were to adduce these contracts, \"it seems highly unlikely that the 'frame contracts\u2019 would contain any unqualified right for Claimant\u2019s products to be used as construction materials in the New 5G Networks\".28 MNOs could only deploy 5G network services after undergoing a licensing process within the exclusive control of the State.29\n\nii.

In turn, Chinese investors are only required to fulfil one requirement under Article 1(2) BIT, namely that they be a company, legal person, or citizen of China, authorized by the Chinese government to make an investment in Sweden. The Claimant posits that it plainly meets this requirement.49 It adds that the exclusion of investors with indirect investments from the scope of the Treaty needs explicit language, which is missing in this case.50\n\nResponse, \u00b6 28-30.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 53-55.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37 quoting **CL-91**, *Tza Yap Shum v.

It covers \"every kind of asset\", including all of Huawei\u2019s specific investments in Sweden, in particular: (i) Huawei\u2019s shareholding in Huawei Sweden, which is protected under Article 1(1)(b) referring to \"[s]hares or other kinds of interests in companies\"; (ii) contractual rights benefiting Huawei, protected under Article 1(1)(c) referring to \"[t]itle[s] to money or any performance having an economic value\"; and (iii) Huawei's direct contributions to the Swedish economy, including in the form of transfer of intellectual property, protected under Article 1(1)(d) referring to \"[c]opyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes, trade-names and goodwill\".51 According to the Claimant, such a broad definition does not support the suggestion that the Treaty parties intended to exclude indirect investments from the scope of protection.52\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40 quoting Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 38.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, in any event, the nature of its investments will be examined in the context of its case on the merits and the claims for damages. Therefore, bifurcating the Respondent's first objection would be inconsistent with the principles of procedural efficiency, as that would entail the risk of having to review evidence twice.53\n\nResponse, \u00b6 40.\n\n23.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's second preliminary objection on the rights underlying the claims, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent misrepresents Huawei's investments and claims.54 It stresses that Huawei Sweden entered into contracts to provide equipment and services to Sweden's MNOs, including with respect to the upcoming 5G networks. Sweden's actions in breach of the Treaty prevented Huawei Sweden from performing those contracts, thereby destroying Huawei Sweden's carrier network business and affecting the value of Huawei's shareholding in Huawei Sweden (held through Huawei NL).55\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 44.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant insists that its claims are not limited to the provision of 5G equipment and services. They also encompass the unlawfully mandated removal of Huawei's \"3G and 4G infrastructure from the 2.3 and 3.5 GHz bands, the negative effects on the provision of equipment for mobile networks operating on other frequencies as well as fixed line networks, and Huawei's exclusion from the future 6G and 7G markets\".56 Consequently, says the Claimant, Sweden's second objection is unfounded.57\n\nResponse, \u00b6 45.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 46.\n\n25.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant submits that an assessment of the Respondent's second objection requires a close analysis of multiple elements that constitute the basis of its claims58 Therefore, the objection is inherently intertwined with the merits of the dispute, making it unsuitable for bifurcation.59\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 51.\n\n26.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s argument that Huawei lacked the authorization of the Chinese Government to invest in Sweden pursuant to Article 1(2) BIT, the Claimant submits that the BIT only requires that the Chinese investor be authorized to make \"an investment,\" not a \"specific investment\".60 For the Claimant, the record clearly shows that Huawei did obtain the required authorization to invest in Sweden.61 As a result, the Respondent\u2019s objection is neither serious nor substantial.62\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 52-54, 58.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 55.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 62.\n\n27.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant requests the Tribunal to deny the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation and to order that the proceedings continue in accordance with Scenario 2(b) of the Procedural Calendar in PO1.63\n\nResponse, \u00b6 65.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n28.\n\nTo address the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation of two preliminary objections, the Tribunal will first set out the legal framework and the relevant bifurcation factors **(A)**. It will then apply those factors to the Respondent\u2019s first **(B)**and second **(C)**preliminary objections.\n\n**A. L****egal framework**\n--------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Treaty is silent on preliminary objections. The applicable rules are thus to be found in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that tribunals can deal with preliminary objections separately or with the merits:\n\nAny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered **by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.**64\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n30.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41 (4) restates that rule:\n\nThe Tribunal [...] **may** deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. [...].65\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n31.\n\nThese provisions grant tribunals ample discretion to determine whether preliminary objections should be decided in a bifurcated phase of the proceedings or joined to the merits. In particular, they do not specify in which circumstances a tribunal should adopt one or the other of these two options.\n\n32.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion should be guided by considerations of procedural fairness and efficiency. The Parties also agree that investment tribunals have considered the following factors to assess whether bifurcation would be procedurally fair and efficient:\n\ni. Is the objection *prima facie* serious and substantial66 in the sense that it has some likelihood of success or at least is not frivolous or vexatious?67\n\nii. Can the objection be assessed without going into the merits of the dispute?68\n\niii. If successful, would the objection put an end to the proceedings or at least materially narrow the dispute?69\n\n*E.g.*, **CL-40,** *Carlos Sastre and others v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/2, Procedural Order No 2: Decision on Bifurcation, 13 August 2020, \u00b6 40; **CL****\u2010****106**, *Orazul International Espa\u00f1a Holdings SL v.

Republic of Serbia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/8, Procedural Order No. 3, 24 June 2019, \u00b6 18(a).\n\n33.\n\nThe second and third criteria indeed appear helpful to determine whether bifurcation would serve efficiency. As for the first one, it is striking to see that tribunals have struggled trying to articulate its content, oscillating between serious and substantial in the sense of likely to succeed and not frivolous or vexatious. The difficulty with the first of those approaches is that, at this early stage of an arbitration, the Tribunal is in no position to assess the likelihood of success of the objections. This is particularly true here, as the objections have merely been outlined to support the request for bifurcation, but have not been briefed yet. The difficulty with the second of these approaches is that labelling an objection as vexatious or frivolous casts aspersions on the party raising the objection, implying that the objection is brought for an improper purpose. It appears more neutral to assess whether, on the basis of the record as it stands, an objection raises a serious issue requiring consideration in a separate procedural phase on the force of the fact allegations and legal arguments as currently formulated.\n\n34.\n\nBy assessing the seriousness of an issue for purposes of bifurcation, the Tribunal merely makes a procedural determination about the most efficient management of an arbitration. In no way does it assess the merits or demerits of an objection, which is a matter for a later decision.\n\n35.\n\nBefore considering the three factors just outlined in relation to the Respondent\u2019s two preliminary objections, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has reserved its right to pursue additional objections later in the proceedings,70 and that the Claimant contends that this approach is abusive or contrary to either ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) or the purpose of bifurcation requests more generally.71\n\nRequest, fn. 24.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 18.\n\n36.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal[,] shall be made as early as possible [and] no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial\". That time limit has not elapsed and the Respondent filed the Request within the time limit fixed by the Procedural Calendar. Moreover, the applicable rules do not require that a bifurcation request necessarily cover all the preliminary objections. Hence, the Respondent\u2019s approach of raising some objections now and reserving others for later is not contrary to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) nor is it abusive. In any event, the Respondent has confirmed that it will not request bifurcation of its possible subsequent objections,72 which it would in any event be barred from doing on the basis of the agreed calendar. Therefore, in terms of efficiency and procedural fairness, the Tribunal can see no drawback in the Respondent\u2019s approach.\n\n*See* Request, fn. 24 (\"Although Sweden reserves its right to pursue additional objections in due course (as necessary), it hereby covenants not to seek the bifurcation thereof\").\n\n**B. F****irst preliminary objection****:** **the existence of a protected investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s first preliminary objection is that the \"Claimant has [not] proven that it had any protected investment in Sweden at the time of the injury that the Claimant alleges\".73 While this objection could be examined without going into the merits and its success would put an end to the proceedings, it does not disclose a serious issue that would justify a preliminary determination based on the materials currently before the Tribunal.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 45(a).\n\n38.\n\nArticle 1(1)(b) of the BIT defines investment as \"every kind of asset invested by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State [...] and more particularly, though not exclusively, [...] shares or other kinds of interest in companies\". It is undisputed at this stage that the Claimant is a Chinese entity, wholly owning Huawei NL, which in turn wholly owns Huawei Sweden.74\n\n*See* Request, \u00b6 24; Response, \u00b6 43. *See also inter alia* **C-10**, Shareholder structure of the relevant entities within the Huawei Group of Companies; **C-8**, Register of membership in Huawei Technologies Co\u00f6peratief UA; **C-16**, Overseas Investment Certificate for Enterprises concerning Huawei Technologies Co, Ltd, 24 July 2020; **C****\u2010****17**, Swedish Companies Registration Office's Certificate of Registration for Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, 24 December 2021; **C-9**, Share Registry of Huawei Technologies Sweden AB.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent's first objection does not contest that in principle the Claimant's indirect shareholding in Huawei Sweden is a protected asset under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT. The Request does not mention the definition of investment in Article 1(1). Nor does the Respondent question whether the Claimant held its indirect shareholding in Huawei Sweden at all relevant times. Rather, the Respondent's objection is that, overall, the Treaty does not protect investments indirectly held by Chinese investors through intermediate companies incorporated in third States, like the Netherlands.\n\n40.\n\nFor bifurcation purposes, it suffices to note that the Treaty's plain text does not appear to limit its applicability or scope to a particular investment structure. To substantiate its objection, the Respondent relies chiefly on Article 1(2) of the BIT. In relevant part, this provision states that, \"in respect of the People's Republic of China\", the term investor shall mean \"any company, other legal person or citizen in China authorized by the Chinese Government to make an investment\". This language makes no reference to the notion of investment, be it direct or indirect, a silence that is unsurprising. Indeed, Article 1(2) defines the notion of investor, not investment, and relates to *ratione personae* not *ratione materiae* jurisdiction.\n\n41.\n\nIt is true that the substantive obligations in Articles 2(1), 2(2) and 3(1) of the BIT, which the Claimant invokes, only apply to \"investments by investors\". However, these provisions do not appear to regulate the manner in which an investor holds its investment for purposes of jurisdiction.\n\n42.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal denies the Respondent's request to bifurcate its first preliminary objection.\n\n**C. Second preliminary objection: the rights underlying the claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent's second preliminary objection is that the \"Claimant has [not] proven that [its] investment included the rights underlying its claims\".75 In particular, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has not established any rights with respect to Sweden's 5G networks, the alleged violation of which constitute the basis for its claims.76\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 45(b).\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17, 29-31.\n\n44.\n\nAs a threshold matter, on the record as it currently stands, the Tribunal understands that the Claimant's case is mainly premised on the allegation that Huawei Sweden concluded long-term contracts with certain Swedish MNOs (i.e., Hi3G, N4M and Telia)77 to provide equipment and services in Sweden's telecommunications sector.78 It is common ground that those contracts are not yet part of the record.79 However, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s suggestion, the Claimant\u2019s case is not limited to claims concerning Sweden\u2019s 5G networks. The claims extend to the alleged effects of Sweden\u2019s measures on the Claimant\u2019s current and/or future undertakings in Sweden regarding *inter alia* 4G, 6G, and 7G technologies, as well as fixed-line networks.80\n\n*See e.g.,* SoC, Appendix 1.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 44-45.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, while the MNO contracts are of \"a confidential nature\", it \"would be willing to seek its contractual counterparties' consent to the disclosure of those contracts\" (SoC, fn. 725). The Claimant further states that \"it has no objection to disclosing the contracts if ordered to do so\" (Response, \u00b6 50).\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 45. *See also,* SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 275-280.\n\n45.\n\nTherefore, it is unclear at this juncture whether and to what extent bifurcating the Respondent\u2019s second objection, which focuses on the Claimant\u2019s alleged 5G rights, would efficiently streamline the adjudication of the dispute. This remains the case irrespective of the Respondent\u2019s subsidiary argument under Article 1(2) of the BIT that Huawei allegedly lacks authorization by the Chinese Government to make 5G-related investments in Sweden.81\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6 13.ii. Contrary to the Claimant's understanding (*see* Response, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 52), this argument does not form a third and separate preliminary objection that the Respondent seeks to bifurcate. It is clear that the Respondent invokes Article 1(2) of the BIT in such a manner only to buttress the second preliminary objection (*see* Request, \u00a7 B.2)\n\n46.\n\nIndeed, as was already mentioned,82 Article 1(2) of the BIT requires that a protected Chinese investor be \"authorized by the Chinese Government to make **an** investment\".83 As the Claimant points out,84 this language does not seem to require that the investment at issue be tied to a particular purpose. Hence, whether or not the Chinese Government authorized Huawei to invest in Sweden\u2019s *5G network* specifically may or may not be dispositive.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 40.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 54.\n\n47.\n\nThis being so, on 8 January 2004, the Bureau of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of Shenzhen Municipality (\"Shenzhen Bureau\") approved Huawei\u2019s application for the establishment of Atelier Telecom AB (\"Atelier\") in Sweden, by \"Huawei Tech. Investment Co., Limited (Hong Kong)\" (\"Huawei Hong Kong\"),85 an entity owned by Huawei.86 In 2004, Atelier was renamed Huawei Sweden.87 The record further suggests that, in 2008, Huawei NL (wholly owned by Huawei)88 replaced Huawei Hong Kong as shareholder in Huawei Sweden.89 Huawei\u2019s \"business scope\" in Sweden as authorized by the Shenzhen Bureau covered \"3G mobile communications\" as well as \"wireless technologies\" more broadly.90 Accordingly, the authorization which the Shenzhen Bureau granted to Huawei in 2004 seemingly included 5G-related investments in Sweden.\n\n**C-12**, Letter from the Bureau of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of Shenzhen Municipality to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, 8 January 2004.\n\n**C-11**, Annual Return of Huawei Tech Investment Co, 2001, p. 6.\n\n**C****\u2010****17**, Swedish Companies Registration Office's Certificate of Registration for Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, 24 December 2021, p 2.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 38.\n\n*See generally* **C-9**, Share Registry of Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, undated.\n\n**C-12**, Letter from the Bureau of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of Shenzhen Municipality to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, 8 January 2004.\n\n48.\n\nThe second objection is, therefore, likely to require the Tribunal to address matters pertaining to the merits of the dispute. As the Claimant argues, the assessment of the second objection potentially requires an analysis of *inter alia:* (i) the regulatory framework of Sweden's telecommunications sector; (ii) the scope, nature, and significance of the purported rights resulting from Huawei Sweden's alleged contracts with MNOs in Sweden; and (iii) the measures taken by Sweden allegedly in contravention of the said rights and the Treaty.91 These elements and their factual and technical underpinnings may also be relevant to the success of the Claimant's substantive claims. It is also possible that the Respondent might be partially successful in respect of the second objection such that it would not dispose of the case in its entirety. Accordingly, the preliminary determination of the second objection does not appear to be procedurally efficient.\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 48.\n\n49.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal denies the Respondent's request to bifurcate the second preliminary objection.\n\n**IV.

Analysis**\n----------------\n\n5.\n\nThe EC seeks to address two matters as a non-disputing party (\"**NDP**\"): the European Union (\"**EU**\") rules and policy on security of 5G networks (\"**Security Regulation Matter**\");3 and the margin of appreciation enjoyed by EU Member States under EU law in defining and ensuring their essential security interests in relation to 5G networks (\"**Margin of Appreciation Matter**\").4\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20ss.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 30ss.\n\n6.\n\nTo that end, the EC seeks leave from the Tribunal to file a \"written *amicus curiae* submission\" **(A)**;5 to access the documents in the record \"to the extent necessary for its intervention\" **(B)**;6 and to \"attend\" the hearing \"in order to present oral argument and [answer] questions\" **(C)**.7 The EC also \"recalls\", but does not expressly request, that the Tribunal could invite it to attend the hearing as an \"expert on EU law\", rather than as a NDP **(D)**.8\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 37. a-b.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 37.c.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 37.d.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 37.d.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses each of these points below.\n\n**A. Written** ***amicus curiae*** **submission**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) gives the Tribunal broad discretion to allow a NDP to \"file a written submission\". To assess whether such a filing is appropriate, however, the provision puts forward three factors for the Tribunal to \"consider\": First, the extent to which the submission would assist the Tribunal in determining a factual or legal issue \"related\" to the proceedings and \"within the scope of the dispute\" **(1)**; second, the extent to which the submission would bring a \"perspective, particular knowledge, or insight different from that\" of the Parties **(2);** and, third, the extent to which the NDP has a \"significant interest\" in the instant proceedings **(3)**. In addition, ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) requires the Tribunal to \"ensure\" that the NDP submission \"does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice\" either Party **(4)**, and that both Parties are given an opportunity to comment on the NDP submission **(5)**.\n\n**1. Factual or legal issues related to the proceedings and within the scope of the dispute**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Security Regulation Matter would assist the Tribunal in determining factual and legal issues that relate to these proceedings and fall within the scope of the dispute. The Parties' main scheduled submissions refer to EU rules and policy on 5G network security. Specifically, the Claimant argues that Huawei's exclusion from Sweden's 5G rollout was inconsistent with the content and purpose of the EU Toolbox on 5G Cybersecurity, which in turn sought to detail a broader set of EU directives and policy documents on the security of mobile communication networks. The Claimant raises this argument in part to show that the exclusion was arbitrary and disproportionate, in breach of the BIT's FET standard,9 while the Respondent argues consistency between the exclusion and the toolbox to defend against the FET claim.10\n\n*See generally* Statement of Reply, 16 May 2024 (\"**Reply**\"), \u00a7\u00a7 III.D.3, V.C.2.\n\n*See generally* Counter-Memorial, 3 November 2023 (\"**Counter-Memorial**\"), \u00a7\u00a7 IV.B.2(a) and (c).\n\n10.\n\nWith respect to the Margin of Appreciation Matter, the situation is different. Indeed, the Parties dispute whether Huawei's exclusion was a disproportionate outlier in the EU, by pointing to how other EU Member States have taken different approaches in terms of 5G security protection.11 According to the Respondent, this \"directly implicates\" the margin of appreciation enjoyed by Member States under EU law to decide on how best to protect their national security interests, including in relation to their telecommunication networks.12 Yet, as the Claimant rightly points out, Sweden's margin of appreciation under EU law is not dispositive of the case at hand.13 While it may play a role in the assessment of the factual matrix, the Tribunal's task is to determine whether and to what extent Sweden is owed deference in the definition and implementation of State measures as a matter not of EU law, but international law including the BIT.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 392ss and Appendix 1; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 794ss and Appendix 1.\n\nR-Comments, \u00b6 24.\n\nC-Comments, p. 7.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that, by briefing the Margin of Appreciation Matter, the EC would not assist it in determining issues sufficiently within the scope of the dispute. This being so, the EC's submission would be limited to the Security Regulation Matter.\n\n**2. Perspective, knowledge, or insight different from that of the Parties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIt is undisputed that the EC has played a leading role in the development and coordination of EU law and policy on the security of electronic communications and the development of 5G networks across Europe, including the toolbox. Therefore, the Security Regulation Matter is likely to bring a perspective, knowledge, or insight different from that of the Parties.\n\n**3. The EC's significant interest in the proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIt is equally undisputed that the EC has a central role in relation to the interpretation and application of EU law. Moreover, as just noted, the EC also led the development of several EU legal and policy instruments on the security of electronic communications, which to some extent form part of the dispute. The Tribunal finds this sufficient to conclude that the EC has a significant interest in the proceedings.\n\n**4. Disruption, burden, or prejudice**\n---------------------------------------\n\n***(i) No disruption of the proceedings***\n------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Application is belated and for that reason alone should be dismissed.14 The Tribunal disagrees.\n\nC-Comments, pp. 4-5.\n\n15.\n\nIt is possible that the EC could have filed the Application earlier. Certainly, that would have been preferable. Be that as it may, there is no preclusive time limit for NDP applications. The only requirement in this respect is that NDP submissions do not disrupt the proceeding, which is not the case here. The current procedural calendar can accommodate a parallel briefing schedule without causing any disruption to the proceeding. The deadline for the Respondent's Rejoinder (30 September 2024) and the hearing dates (25 November to 6 December 2024) would remain unchanged.\n\n16.\n\nSpecifically, it is appropriate to allow the EC to file its submission within one month of receiving a copy of this Order from ICSID and invite the Parties to file simultaneous comments one month thereafter.15 This would conclude the parallel briefing schedule well before the hearing, giving the Parties appropriate time to prepare for oral argument and witness/expert examination.\n\n*See infra*, \u00b6 21.\n\n***(ii) No undue burden***\n--------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe filing of any NDP submission inevitably requires the parties to expend additional time and effort in reviewing and responding to its contents, and the EC's submission would be no exception. Still, the Security Regulation Matter involves issues in dispute between the Parties. It follows that a submission by the EC limited to addressing this point would not impose an undue burden on the Parties. To further limit any potential burden, however, the Tribunal will set a 20-page limit on the EC's submission and the Parties' comments.\n\n18.\n\nIn these circumstances, requesting the EC to furnish an undertaking agreeing to bear the Parties' costs arising from its intervention, as the Claimant suggests,16 appears disproportionate. In all likelihood, such a request will cause procedural difficulties, time inefficiencies, and even preclude the EC from participating as a NDP.\n\nC-Comments, pp. 4-5.\n\n***(iii) No unfair prejudice***\n-------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 June 2023, the EC made several statements concerning Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company. It stated that \"Huawei and ZTE represent in fact materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers\",17 and therefore that it would \"take measures to avoid exposure of its corporate communications to mobile networks using Huawei and ZTE\".18 The EC also broadly endorsed the exclusion of Huawei by affirming that \"decisions adopted by Member States to restrict or exclude Huawei and ZTE\" from their 5G networks for being \"high-risk suppliers\" were \"justified and compliant with the [\u2026] Toolbox\".19 Later, in a reasoned communication addressed to Huawei dated 6 October 2023, the EC concluded that the exclusion was consistent with EU law.20\n\n**C-331**, Communication from the European Commission \u2013 Implementation of the 5G cybersecurity Toolbox, 15 June 2023, p. 3 (of the PDF).\n\n**C-331**, Communication from the European Commission \u2013 Implementation of the 5G cybersecurity Toolbox, 15 June 2023, p. 4 (of the PDF).\n\n**C-331**, Communication from the European Commission \u2013 Implementation of the 5G cybersecurity Toolbox, 15 June 2023, p. 3 (of the PDF).\n\n*See generally* **R-513**, Letter from European Commission to Mr. Alexandre Verheyden, Jones Day (Counsel for Huawei Technologies AB Sweden), 6 October 2023.\n\n20.\n\nIt is therefore evident that the EC is not a neutral party. Yet, it is standard that NDPs advocate for interests and causes that may conflict with the positions of one of the disputing parties. This appears to be a feature that is built into the mechanism of NDP submissions and the conditions for their admission. Indeed, the condition that a NDP have \"a significant interest\" implies that it need not be neutral, independent, or objective. This being so, the EC's intervention would not entail an unfair prejudice to the Claimant, especially considering that NPD submissions do not constitute evidence. Moreover, the Tribunal would critically assess the content of the EC's submission in light of the Parties' comments and accounting for the fact that it comes from an NDP which has taken positions adverse to the Claimant's interests.\n\n**5. Opportunity to comment**\n-----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIt is sufficient to allow the Parties to present their observations on the EC's submission through simultaneous comments. There is no reason to adopt a consecutive sequence, as the Respondent suggests.21 Simultaneous submissions will be time-efficient and ensure equality between the Parties. To maintain that equality throughout the briefing process, however, it is necessary to preclude the Respondent from using its forthcoming Rejoinder (due on 30 September 2024) to address either the EC's submission or the Claimant's corresponding comments.\n\nR-Comments, \u00b6 33.\n\n**B. Access to the record to the extent necessary**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, at a later stage, the Tribunal will need to determine, in consultation with the Parties, the scope and modalities of the EC's intervention, including whether the EC should be granted access to the record.22 For now, the Claimant simply \"flags its grave reservations\" about giving the EC access to the record, invoking the EC's lack of neutrality and stating that any disclosure of documents would contravene the confidentiality regime in Procedural order No. 2 (\"**PO2**\").23 On the other hand, the Respondent does not comment on the EC's access to the record.\n\nC-Comments, p. 5.\n\nC-Comments, fn. 16.\n\n23.\n\nThe Application included the EC's request to access the record and the opportunity for the Parties to comment on the Application has elapsed. Therefore, this request is ripe for decision.\n\n24.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the EC need not access the record to prepare a submission on the Security Regulation Matter. The submission is not meant to comment on the facts or the evidence of the case, nor on the Parties' positions. Therefore, the Tribunal denies the access request, noting that the EC has, in any event, at least a general understanding of the relevant issues in dispute, as it has opined outside this arbitration that Sweden's conduct *vis-\u00e0-vis* Huawei is consistent with EU law and policy in matters of security of 5G networks.24\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6 19.\n\n**C. Attendance at the hearing**\n--------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) only refers to the possibility of a NDP \"fil[ing] a written submission\". More importantly, the Parties have agreed from the outset that hearings would be closed to the public unless they agreed otherwise subsequently,25 and there is no such agreement to date.\n\nPO2, \u00b6 8 and Annex 1, \u00b6 1.\n\n26.\n\nSimilarly, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(2), the Tribunal may allow \"other persons\" such as the EC to attend the hearing, \"[u]nless either [P]arty objects\". However, the Claimant requests that the Application be denied \"in full\",26 meaning that in principle it objects to the EC's intervention at the hearing.\n\nC-Comments, p. 9.\n\n27.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimant submits that, if the Tribunal were to allow the EC to file a submission, the corresponding EC representatives would have to appear at the hearing for examination.27 Yet, ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) only mandates that the Parties be given an opportunity to present their observations on the EC's submission, and their written simultaneous comments satisfy that requirement.\n\nC-Comments, p. 5.\n\n28.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal will not allow EC representatives to attend the hearing.\n\n**D. EC as EU law expert**\n--------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAs noted above, the EC has contemporaneously taken views against Huawei regarding the consistency between Huawei's exclusion from Sweden's 5G rollout and EU law.28 This issue being part of the matrix of the dispute, the EC cannot qualify as an independent EU law expert in this arbitration.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6 19.\n\n**III. Order**\n--------------\n\n30.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal:\n\ni. Admits the EC as a NDP.\n\nii. Allows the EC to file a submission limited to addressing the Security Regulation Matter, which may be supported by legal authorities and must not exceed 20 pages, within 30 days of being notified a copy of this Order.\n\niii. Invites the Parties to submit simultaneous comments on the EC's submission, which may include supporting authorities and may not exceed 20 pages, within 30 days of the EC filing its submission.\n\niv. Orders the Respondent not to address either the EC's submission or the Claimant's comments thereto in its Rejoinder.\n\nv. Denies the EC's other requests.\n\nvi. Invites ICSID to notify a copy of this Order to the EC."}]}
