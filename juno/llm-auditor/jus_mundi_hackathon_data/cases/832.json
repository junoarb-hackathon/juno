PROCEDURAL ISSUES**\n------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 14 February 2008, BRANDES INVESTMENT PARTNERS, LP (hereinafter also \"Brandes\" or \"the Claimant\") filed a Request for Arbitration against THE BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA (hereinafter also \"Venezuela\" or \"the Respondent.\")\n\n2.\n\nOn 24 March 2008, the Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nOn 8 December 2008, the Tribunal was constituted with Dr. Robert Briner, President, Professor Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, Arbitrator, and Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator.\n\n4.\n\nOn 19 December 2008, the Respondent filed Preliminary Objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n5.\n\nOn 12 January 2009, the Claimant submitted its Observations on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections of 19 December 2008.\n\n6.\n\nAt the occasion of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal, held on 29 January 2009, in Paris, counsel for both Parties orally presented their positions and answered questions put to them by the Members of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nAs discussed during the First Session, the dispositive of the Decision dated 2 February 2009 was notified on 4 February 2009, whereas the present document also contains the reasons for the Decision.\n\n**2. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal summarises below, insofar as relevant for the present Decision, the Claimant's position as pleaded in its Request for Arbitration, the Respondent's position as pleaded in its Objections pursuant to Rule 41(5), the Claimant's position as pleaded in its Response to Claimant's Objections and the positions as presented orally by counsel for both Parties at the occasion of the First Session.\n\n2.1. SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMANT'S REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant, a United States registered investment adviser, exposes that prior to the actions challenged in this Arbitration it controlled a substantial number of American Depository Receipts and shares of Compa\u00f1ia An\u00f3nima Nacional Tel\u00e9fonos de Venezuela (hereinafter \"CANTV\") that it acquired for and on behalf of its clients.1\n\nRequest for Arbitration, 14 Feb. 2008, para. 5.\n\n10.\n\nCANTV is a company registered under the laws of Venezuela and is Venezuela's largest telecommunications company.2\n\n*Id*., para. 9.\n\n11.\n\nIn 1991, CANTV entered into a Concession Agreement with Venezuela with the right to \"*organize and install, as the case may require, and to render, manage, operate and exploit the telecommunications services*\" in Venezuela.3\n\n*Id*., para. 12.\n\n12.\n\nIn 2007, the Respondent offered to purchase all the American Depository Receipts and shares of CANTV. According to the Claimant, the tender offer of the Respondent was substantially below market value.4 The tender offer took place, according to the Claimant, in a context of nationalization of many private companies by Venezuela.\n\n*Id*., para. 33.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant states that the Respondent coerced it into accepting the tender by indicating its intention to control and manage CANTV after the tender as a \"*social, national and regional political tool of the Venezuelan State without regard to economic profitability*.\"5 The Claimant accepted Respondent's tender and received USD225.5 million in exchange of its shares.6\n\n*Id*., para. 36.\n\n*Id*., para. 59.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent's tender expired on May 8, 2007. As a consequence of the tender, the Respondent became the owner of 86.2% of CANTV.7\n\n*Id*., para. 35.\n\n15.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent's conduct was unlawful and resulted in Brandes' sale to Venezuela of its shares in CANTV at a loss. Said shares constitute an investment of the Claimant within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.8\n\n*Id*., para. 32.\n\n16.\n\nRespondent's unlawful measures were tantamount to an expropriation by destroying the value of Claimant's investment without proper indemnification.9\n\n*Id*., para. 60.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent also violated its obligation not to take arbitrary and discriminatory measures and to treat Brandes' investment fairly and equitably.10\n\n*Id*., para. 61.\n\n2.2. SUMMARY OF THE RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS UNDER RULE 41(5)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn its objections of 19 December 2008, pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant's Request for Arbitration omits to mention many facts of the case.\n\n19.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that when selling its shares to Venezuela, the Claimant agreed to waive and release any claims it may have had against the latter in connection with the tender. According to the Respondent, the waiver and release expressly covered all claims asserted by the Claimant in the present Arbitration.11\n\nRespondent's Objections Pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 19 Dec. 2008, para. 17.\n\n20.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant is not an investor within the meaning of the ICSID Convention, as it was only acting as an agent and not as an owner.12\n\n*Id*., para. 19.\n\n21.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the examination of the essential facts omitted by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration leads to the conclusion that there is neither a jurisdictional nor a substantive basis for the claims in this case and that Venezuela did not violate any duties towards the Claimant.13\n\n*Id*., para. 25.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) provides for a specific procedure to address a case where claims are manifestly without legal merit. As these conditions are fulfilled the Arbitral Tribunal should dismiss the case on an expedited basis, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n2.3. SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMANT'S RESPONSE TO THE RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn its Response, dated 12 January 2009, the Claimant opposes all the objections raised by the Respondent.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the objections addressed by the Respondent do not concern the merits of Brandes' claims but are a form of \"*exceptions d'incomp\u00e9tence*.\"14\n\nClaimant's Response to Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objections, 12 Feb. 2009, para. 4.\n\n25.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the objections fall outside the scope of Rule 41(5) because they do not concern the merits of the dispute but only the Tribunal's jurisdiction.15 A manifest failure of jurisdiction is to be addressed at the registration stage by the Secretary General, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Claimant notes that the Respondent did not raise any jurisdictional objection at the registration stage.\n\n*Id*., para. 19.\n\n26.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Rule 41(5) applies if the claim is not only without legal merit but if the lack of legal merit is manifest. A claim shall be qualified or considered as without manifest legal merit if it \"*frivolou* s\" or \"*patently unmeritorious*.\"16 The Respondent has the burden to show that a claim is patently without merit and frivolous. According to the Claimant, the Respondent fails to provide such demonstration.17\n\n*Id*., para. 23.\n\n*Id*., para. 18.\n\n27.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant argues that the Respondent raised factual objections rather than legal objections. Such factual objections do not fall within the scope of Rule 41(5).18\n\n*Id*., paras. 20 *et seq*.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant states that the waiver contained in the CANTV tender does not prevent it from bringing its claim in these proceedings. Firstly, Brandes still controls some CANTV shares not tendered to Venezuela. Secondly, the waiver does not apply to issues of compensation for an illegal expropriation and other claims that can be raised in an ICSID Arbitration. Thirdly, the waiver was coercively obtained by the Respondent. Fourthly, the waiver argument is not an objection to the merits of Claimant's claim but rather concerns the issue whether the Tribunal is competent to consider the subject matter of the claims raised by the Claimant.19\n\n*Id*., para. 42.\n\n29.\n\nFinally, the Claimant claims to have standing to pursue ICSID claims for and on behalf of its clients. According to the Claimant, it is an investor within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the Respondent fails to provide concrete facts showing the contrary. The Claimant emphasises that the objection with respect to its standing is a jurisdictional objection not covered by Rule 41(5).20\n\n*Id*., para. 42.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant requests that Respondent's objections be rejected.\n\n2.4. SUMMARY OF THE ORAL SUBMISSIONS\n------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent in its oral presentation on 29 January 2009 again mentioned that its main arguments are that the Respondent has waived all claims asserted in this case21 and that it has no standing as the Claimant is not an investor, it never owned the shares and everything it did was for and on behalf of clients who are unnamed and the Respondent does not know how many there are.22\n\nFirst Session of the Arbitral Tribunal, 29 Jan. 2009, Transcript, pp. 65, 22, 24.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 69, 7-11.\n\n32.\n\nThe case does not present any genuine issues of facts and it can be decided on pure legal principles.23\n\n*Id.*, pp. 69, 22-70, 1.\n\n33.\n\nReference was also made to the article of Aurelia Antonietti \"*The 2006 Amendment to the ICSID Rules and Regulations and the Additional Facility Rules*,\" where she wrote the following:\n\n\"*The expedited objection can be a jurisdictional objection and/or an objection related to the merits*.... *The Discussion and the Working Papers did not necessarily encompass expedited objections to jurisdiction*. *However, in light of the discussions which followed the Working Paper and given the comments received, it has appeared that expedited objections on jurisdiction could not be**ruled out of the scope of Rule 41(5)*. *Accordingly, Rule 41(5) does include expedited objections to jurisdiction although it was primarily designed to dismiss frivolous claims on the merit*.\"24\n\n\"*A respondent might for example challenge, in an expedited manner, the temporal application of a treaty in which consent to ICSID arbitration is given;**or could object that the claimant had waived its right in writing to bring the case before an arbitral tribunal*.\"25\n\nAurelia Antonietti, *The 2006 Amendments to the ICSID Rules and Regulations and the Additional Facility Rules,* ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Fall 2006), pp. 439-40.\n\n*Id*., p. 439.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the whole discussion whether legal objections to jurisdiction would be excluded from the application of Rule 41(5) is not really relevant because the objections which the Respondent raises are not purely jurisdictional in nature. Waiver is not a jurisdictional issue and standing is a mixed issue and therefore neither a pure jurisdictional issue.26\n\nFirst Session of the Arbitral Tribunal, 29 Jan. 2009, Transcript, pp. 84, 73, 18-23.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that the standard of \"manifest\" is quite high27 but \"[a]*t the end of**the day, either there is a waiver or there is not*. *Either there is standing or there is not*. *You could raise ten objections to that*. *That does not mean it is inappropriate to decide on Rule 41(5)*.\"28\n\n*Id*., pp. 75, 10-11.\n\n*Id*., pp. 76, 24-77, 3.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent then discusses the question of the waiver which, according to it, clearly applies to the claims raised in this case. Furthermore, agents or investment advisers do not have standing to bring an ICSID case.\n\n37.\n\nIn its oral presentation, the Claimant argues that what has been called a waiver is not a waiver that is applicable with respect to the claims that the Claimant is asserting.29\n\n*Id*., pp. 96, 20-22.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the ICSID Convention does not define \"*investor*,\" Article 25 of the ICSID Convention speaks of \"*investment*\" and of \"*nationals*\" but not of \"*investors*.\" Also the investment law of Venezuela, Article 3 at subparagraph 4, defines as international investor \"*the owner of an international investment or whoever actually controls it*.\"30\n\n*Id*., pp. 111, 1-8.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[a] *41(5) application is appropriate with respect to merit objections*. *It is not appropriate with respect to jurisdictional objections*.\"31\n\n*Id*., pp. 114, 23-115, 1.\n\n**3. DETERMINATION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n3.1. GENERAL REMARKS\n--------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn its objections of 19 December 2008, the Respondent asks for the application of Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n41.\n\nRule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides :\n\n\"*Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit*. *The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection*. *The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection*. *The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit*.\"\n\n42.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Parties did not agree to another expedited procedure.\n\n43.\n\nIt is also not disputed that the Respondent filed its objection within the deadline of 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal. Indeed, the Tribunal was constituted on 8 December 2008 and the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections on 19 December 2008.\n\n3.2. THE SCOPE OF THE OBJECTIONS RELATED TO JURISDICTION/MERITS\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, objections pertaining to the jurisdiction or competence of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot constitute the subject matter of a preliminary objection within the sense of Rule 41(5) as the text only speaks of merit.\n\n45.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there exist no such limits as the term \"*legal merit*\" encompasses all possible objections against claims which manifestly do not have any basis.\n\n46.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that Rule 41(1) expressly addresses the issue of objections regarding the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal which have to be raised \"*not later than the expiration of the time-limit for the filing of the counter-memorial*.\" The Tribunal then \"*may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute*\" (Rule 41(4)).\n\n47.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that the purpose of the introduction of Rule 41(5) in the course of the 2006 Amendments to the Arbitration Rules is to prevent \"*patently unmeritorious claims*.\" They basically agree with the interpretation given by Antonio R. Parra, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Centre, in his recent article:\n\n\"*The Secretariat is powerless to prevent the initiation of proceedings that clear this jurisdictional threshold, but are frivolous as to the merits*. *This had been a source of recurring complaints from some respondent governments*. *One of the amendments to the ICSID Arbitration Rules made in 2006 was to introduce a procedure, in Rule 41, for the early dismissal by arbitral tribunals of patently unmeritorious claims*.\"32\n\nAntonio R. Parra, *The Development of the Regulations and Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes*, INTERN'L LAwYER, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Spring 2007), p. 56.\n\n48.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the change in the ICSID Arbitration Rules was tailored to address frivolous claims on the merits rather than to open a third avenue to raise jurisdictional objections in view of the fact that the Secretary-General of the Centre under Article 36(3) of the Convention already has the authority not to register a Request for Arbitration if \"*he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre*.\"\n\n49.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent as support for its position that Rule 41(5) also covers objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal refers to the article by Aurelia Antonietti,33 according to whom, the objection can be a jurisdictional one and/or one related to the merits.\n\n*See* para. 33, *supra*.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal first of all notes that Rule 41(5) does not mention \"*jurisdiction*.\" The terms employed are \"*legal merit*.\" This wording, by itself, does not provide a reason why the question whether or not a tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to hear and decide a claim could not be included in the very general notion that the claim filed is \"*without legal merit*.\"\n\n51.\n\nThe examination by the Secretary-General of the request under Article 36 of the Convention is limited to \"*the information contained in the request*.\" It is based on this information that the Secretary-General has to decide whether \"*the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre*.\"34 The argument of a respondent that \"*the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is**not within the competence of the Tribunal*\"35 can only be filed once the case has been registered and the procedure put in motion.\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 36(3).\n\nRule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n52.\n\nUntil 2006 the Rules therefore did not provide for any possibility to terminate the proceedings at an early stage in the case of requests which are patently unmeritorious. There exist no objective reasons why the intent not to burden the parties with a possibly long and costly proceeding when dealing with such unmeritorious claims should be limited to an evaluation of the merits of the case and should not also englobe an examination of the jurisdictional basis on which the tribunal's powers to decide the case rest.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that such a finding would mean that there are actually three levels at which jurisdictional objections could be examined. First by the Secretariat, and if the case passes that level, it would then be under Rule 41(5), and if it passes that level, it might still be under Rule 41(1).\n\n54.\n\nIn view of the fact that the revision of 2006 introducing Rule 41(5) provides very short time-limits, as the objection has to be raised \"*in any event before the first session of the Tribunal*\" and the Tribunal has to give the Parties only \"*the opportunity to present their observations on the objection*\" and is then compelled to notify its decision to the parties \"*at its first session or promptly thereafter*,\" this proceeding is not overly burdensome and if it can avoid cases to go ahead if there is a manifest absence of jurisdiction, it can clearly fulfil the basic objectives of this Rule which is to prevent the continuation of a procedure when the claim is without legal merit.\n\n55.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore interprets Rule 41(5) in the sense that the term \"*legal merit*\" covers all objections to the effect that the proceedings should be discontinued at an early stage because, for whatever reason, the claim can manifestly not be granted by the Tribunal.\n\n3.3. THE SCOPE OF THE OBJECTION RELATED TO FACTS/LAW\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe second question is whether issues of fact can be discussed at this stage and whether a claim having no factual basis at all could be considered in order to be summarily dismissed.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the objection should be rejected as it is not a proper objection based on an absence of legal merit, but an objection based on facts:\n\n\"*The allegations by Respondent also raise factual questions beyond the scope of Brandes' Request for Arbitration that cannot be resolved on the expedited timetable of an application pursuant to Rule 41(5)*.\"36\n\nClaimant Response to Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objections, para. 4; *see also id*. *,* para. 13: \"*To the extent that an objection raises a factual rather than a legal issue, it does not fall within the scope of permissible preliminary objections...*.\"\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it useful to again turn to the earlier mentioned article of Aurelia Antonietti, where it is explained why the final adopted rule mentioned a \"*claim manifestly without legal merit*\" while the draft referred to a \"*claim manifestly without merit* :\"\n\n\"*This change was introduced to avoid inappropriate discussions on the facts of the case at that stage*.\"37\n\n*Id*. *,* p. 440.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal has no difficulty to conclude that the objection on an expedited basis should concern a legal impediment to a claim and not a factual one. This does not mean that the question of the proper dealing with the facts is *ipso facto* solved. As said also by Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, \"[n]*onetheless, one can foresee that the question of whether facts and evidentiary issues can be discussed by a tribunal at that stage will be highly debatable*.\"38\n\n*Id.*\n\n60.\n\nAs an additional remark, the Tribunal wishes to refer here also to a comment made by the tribunal in the *Trans-Global* case, which it shares:\n\n\"*At this early stage of these proceedings, without any sufficient evidence, the Tribunal is in no position to decide disputed facts alleged by either side in a summary procedure*. *Nonetheless, the Tribunal recognizes that it is rarely possible to assess the legal merits of any claim without also examining the factual premise upon which that claim is advanced*.\"39\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc*. *v*. *Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25) [U.S./Jordan BIT], Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 12 May 2008, para. 97.\n\n61.\n\nIt is the Tribunal's view, that basically the factual premise has to be taken as alleged by the Claimant. Only if on the best approach for the Claimant, its case is manifestly without legal merit, it should be summarily dismissed.\n\n3.4. THE SCOPE OF THE OBJECTION: THE MEANING OF *MANIFESTLY*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nAs mentioned repeatedly above, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the new procedure of the preliminary objections under Rule 41(5) is intended to create the possibility to dismiss at an early stage such cases which are clearly unmeritorious. It is a summary proceeding to be conducted on an expedited basis. The rules of due process, however, should continue to be respected. A tribunal should therefore uphold such an objection and come to the final conclusion that all claims are without legal merit only if it concludes that this is \"*manifestly*\" the case. This applies with respect to the merits of the claims but also when the tribunal examines the question of jurisdiction. The level of scrutiny of \"*manifestly*\" obviously provides a far higher threshold than the *prima facie* standard normally applied for jurisdiction under Rule 41(1) where the factual premise for the decision on jurisdiction is normally taken as alleged by the Claimant.\n\n63.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore agrees with the analysis as made by the tribunal in the *Trans-Global* case:\n\n\"*The Tribunal considers*... *that the ordinary meaning of the word [manifest] requires the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and dispatch*. *The standard is thus set high*.... *The exercise may thus be complicated; but it should never be difficult*.\"40\n\n*Id*., para. 88.\n\n64.\n\nIn order to respect the due process, \"*the rule is directed only at clear and obvious cases*,\"41 and \"*as a basic principle of procedural fairness, an award under Rule 41(5) can only apply to a clear and obvious case, i*. *e*. *in Mr Parra's words cited above, \u2018patently unmeritorious claims*. ' \"42\n\n*Id*., para. 90.\n\n*Id*., para. 92 (quoting Antonio R. Parra, *The Development of the Regulations and Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes*, p. 56.)\n\n3.5. THE BURDEN OF PROOF AT A RULE 41(5) OBJECTION STAGE\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe manner in which a tribunal has to deal with the facts will greatly depend on the role these facts and the proof of their existence play at the different stages of the procedure. It appears to the Tribunal, that facts can play three different roles: (i) facts which are the basis for a finding of responsibility; (ii) facts which are the basis for a finding of jurisdiction; (iii) facts which even if proven cannot be the basis for a finding of jurisdiction or responsibility.\n\n66.\n\nIf the alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the relevant BIT or investment law, they have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained or not at the merit level. If jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage, unless the issue cannot be decided at that stage, in which case it should be joined to the merits.\n\n67.\n\nThis double approach is routinely followed by arbitral tribunals. The alleged facts complained of have to be accepted *pro tem* at the jurisdictional phase. Recently, the tribunal in *Saipem v*. *Bangladesh*43 stated:\n\n\"*The Tribunal's task is to determine the meaning and scope of the provisions upon which [the claimant] relies to assert jurisdiction and to assess whether the facts alleged by [the claimant] fall within those provisions or would be capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the treaty obligations involved*. *In performing this task, the Tribunal will apply a prima facie standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions and to the assessment whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions*. *In doing so, the Tribunal will assess whether [the claimant's] case is reasonably arguable on its face*. *If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merit*.\"44\n\nIt is quite clear that the tribunal refers here to facts capable of being analyzed as a breach of the BIT, and not to facts whose existence is necessary to support jurisdiction.\n\n*Saipem S*. *p*. *A*. *v*. *People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, para. 91. *See also* for the same approach, *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S*. *A*. *and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S*. *A*. *(formerly Empresas Lucchetti, S*. *A*. *and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S*. *A*. *) v*. *Republic of Peru (ICSID Case No*. *ARB/03/4)*, Decision on Annulment, 5 Sept., 2007, paras. 118-19.\n\n*See also Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A*. *S*. *v*. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 Nov. 2005, where the tribunal articulated the relevant *prima facie* standard at the jurisdictional stage of the proceeding: \"[t]he Tribunal should be satisfied that, if the facts or the contentions alleged by [the claimant] are ultimately proven true, they would be capable of constituting a violation of the BIT.\" *Id*., para. 194.\n\n68.\n\nIf, on the contrary, the alleged facts are facts on which the jurisdiction of a tribunal rests, it seems evident that the tribunal has to decide those facts, if contested between the parties, and cannot accept the facts as alleged by the claimant. The tribunal must take into account the facts and their interpretation as alleged by the claimant as well as the facts and their interpretation as alleged by the respondent, and make a decision on their existence and proper interpretation. This unavoidable analysis has been followed by other international tribunals, like for example the ICSID tribunal in *Inceysa Vallisoletana S*. *L*. *v*. *Republic of El Salvador* :\n\n\"*If, in order to rule on its own competence, the Arbitral Tribunal is obligated to analyze facts and substantive normative provisions that constitute premises for the definition of the scope of the Tribunal's competence, then it has no alternative, but to deal with them*.\"45\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana S*. *L*. *v*. *Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26), Award, 2 Aug. 2006, para. 155. This evident approach has also been forcefully supported by Sir Franklin Berman QC, in his dissenting opinion in the case *Industria Nacional de Alimentos*, where he stated: \"*Factual matters can or**should be provisionally accepted at the preliminary phase, because there will be a full opportunity to put them to the test definitively later on*. *But if particular facts are a critical element in the establishment of jurisdiction itself, so that the decision to accept or to deny jurisdiction disposes of them once and for all for this purpose, how can it be seriously claimed that those facts should be assumed rather than proved?*\" *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S*. *A*. *v*. *Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4), Decision on Annulment, Dissenting Opinion of Franklin Berman QC, 5 Sept. 2007, para. 17.\n\n69.\n\nThe situation here concerns the third hypothesis mentioned in paragraph 65. The Tribunal considers that, if it is manifest that a claim is devoid of any legal merit, even if the facts are proven, the burden of proof should be the same as the one adopted in the reverse situation, being the situation where the claim should be granted if the facts are proven. In other words, at this preliminary stage, it is sufficient, in the Tribunal's view, to accept *prima facie* the plausible facts as presented by the Claimant. Thus, the Tribunal agrees here with the Claimant, when it states that the Respondent \"*must show that on the circumstances as they plausibly arise out of the Request for Arbitration, the claimant cannot be granted legal relief*.\"46\n\nClaimant's Response to Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objections, para. 18.\n\n70.\n\nA preliminary objection under Rule 41(5) is an objection based on the manifest absence of legal merit of a claim, not on the absence of a factual basis. It is therefore not necessary to prove facts, if these facts, even if proven, are not capable of supporting a claim that has no legal merit.\n\n3.6. DOES THE EXISTENCE OF A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO PURSUE CLAIMS MANIFESTLY RENDER SUCH CLAIMS WITHOUT LEGAL MERIT, AS OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe waiver issue raises a number of questions which cannot be decided based on the file as it presently exists. It has been alleged by the Claimant that not all shares and/or ADRs have been tendered to the Venezuelan Government. Moreover, the waiver expressly states that the waiver extends only to \"*the maximum extent permissible under the applicable law*,\" and the Claimant also contends that it has no legal value as it has been obtained by coercion. In addition, the Claimant asserts that it has never signed any waiver, that the so-called waiver referred to by the Respondent is merely \"*a unilateral declaration of intent by Respondent to which Brandes is alleged to have acceded by conduct*.\"47 The Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the answers to these questions necessitate the examination of complex legal and factual issues which cannot be resolved in these summary proceedings.\n\n*Id*., para. 28\n\n3.7. DOES THE ALLEGATION THAT THE CLAIMANT ACTS AS AN AGENT OF INVESTORS MANIFESTLY RENDERS ITS CLAIM WITHOUT LEGAL STANDING,I.E. LEGAL MERIT**?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nIf the Claimant's position that it is an investor under the ICSID Convention is accepted, the claim does not manifestly lack legal merit on this account. In any case, in order to answer fully such a question, complex issues of fact have to be determined, especially the exact relationship between Brandes, as an investment advisor, and its clients. The Claimant furthermore considered that under the applicable Venezuelan legislation to obtain the investor protection it is not necessary to be the economic or beneficial owner of the shares in question but that control of such shares, which the Claimant stated it had, is sufficient for the Claimant to have its claim examined and decided. The Tribunal therefore again comes to the conclusion that these difficult legal questions cannot be resolved in these summary proceedings.\n\n3.8. CONCLUSIONS\n----------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the new Rules introduced in 2006 regarding preliminary objections in cases where a claim is manifestly without legal merit allows an examination of the jurisdiction and competence of the Centre and of the Tribunal. Rule 41(5) therefore allows an early expedited finding if it is manifest that the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Tribunal for the claims brought before the Tribunal is lacking.\n\nWith respect to the merits of the claim, an award denying such claims can only be made if the facts, as alleged by the Claimant and which *prima facie* seem plausible, are not manifestly of such a nature that the claim would have to be dismissed. The Tribunal does not consider this to be the case.\n\nAfter having considered the written submissions by both Parties and having given the Parties the opportunity to present their oral observations on the Objections at its first session held in Paris on 29 January 2009, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n1. The Respondent's Objections of 19 December 2008 are rejected;\n\n2. The Tribunal reserves all other issues to a further order, decision or award, including any question as to costs;\n\n3. The further procedure will be according to the agreement reached at the first session."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2011-08-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 14 February, 2008, Brandes Investment Partners, LP, a United States registered investment adviser, filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\") against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. On 24 March, 2008, the Centre registered the Request.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this proceeding by the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP in Washington, DC. Since 22 February, 2008, the Respondent has been represented in this proceeding by the law firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP in New York and SC in Mexico City.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of 28 March, 2008, the Claimant appointed Professor Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, a German national, as arbitrator.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of 14 May, 2008, the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a French national, as arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nAs the Tribunal was not constituted within 90 days of registration of the Request, by letter of 12 September, 2008, the Claimant requested the appointment of the third presiding arbitrator by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, as provided for under Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"). On 5 December, 2008, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Dr. Robert Briner, a national of Switzerland, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nAll of the arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Tribunal was constituted on 8 December, 2008. Ms. Katia Yannaca-Small, Senior Counsel at ICSID, was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 December, 2008, having consulted with the Parties and the Centre, the Tribunal scheduled the first session of the Tribunal to take place on 29 January, 2009, at the World Bank's Paris Conference Center. On the same date, the Secretary of the Tribunal circulated a provisional agenda to the Parties, who were invited to confer and to advise the Tribunal, by no later than 16 January, 2009, of any points on the provisional agenda about which they were able to reach agreement. The Parties were also invited to notify the Tribunal of any other items that they wished to see included in the agenda. By joint submission of 16 January, 2009b the Parties communicated to the Tribunal their positions and views on the items of the provisional agenda.\n\n8.\n\nOn 19 December, 2008, the Respondent filed its Objections Pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n9.\n\nOn 12 January, 2009, the Claimant submitted its Response to Respondent's Preliminary Objections of 19 December, 2008.\n\n10.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal and the hearing on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections were held on 29 January, 2009, at the World Bank's Paris Conference Center. Present at the session were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\nDr. Robert Briner, *President*\n\nProf. Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, *Arbitrator* Prof. Brigitte Stern, *Arbitrator* ICSID Secretariat\n\nMrs. Katia Yannaca-Small, *Secretary of the Tribunal*\n\nRepresenting the Claimant\n\nMr. Michael D.

O'Donoghue, *Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP*\n\nMs. Gabriela \u00c1lvarez \u00c1vila, *Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle SC*\n\nMr. Carlos Arvelaiz, General Counsel of the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology, *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*\n\nMs. Alejandra Hidalgo, Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology,\n\n*Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*\n\n11.\n\nParagraph 14 of the Minutes of the First Session reads as follows:\n\n\"**Number and Sequence of Pleadings, Time Limits, Supporting Documentation (Arbitration Rules 20 (1) (c) and 31)**\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Claimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to address the merits of this proceeding. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 41, and as agreed during the session, Respondent's jurisdictional objection, limited to the interpretation of Article 22 of the Venezuelan Foreign Investment Law as a basis for jurisdiction in this case, shall be addressed by the Tribunal prior to consideration of the merits of the claim asserted in the Request for Arbitration.\n\nAt the session, the Parties have agreed to and the Tribunal confirmed the following schedule for briefing on Respondent's jurisdictional objections...\"\n\n12.\n\nAt the first session of the Tribunal, counsel for both Parties orally presented their positions regarding the Respondent's preliminary objections under Rule 41(5) and answered questions posed by the Members of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Objections under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules dated 2 February, 2009 was notified to the Parties on 4 February, 2009. A reasoned decision was provided to the Parties on 3 April, 2009.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction on 15 April, 2009. On 30 June, 2009, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. The Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction on 1 September, 2009, and the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 15 October, 2009.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of 28 July, 2009, Dr. Briner submitted his resignation to his co-arbitrators and the Secretary General of ICSID due to ill health. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceeding was suspended until the vacancy created by Dr. Briner's resignation could be filled.\n\n16.\n\nThe Parties were unable to agree on a candidate for president of the Tribunal to replace Dr. Briner. Accordingly, by letter of 20 November, 2009, the Claimant requested that ICSID proceed with the appointment of the new President pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 11 (1). After due consultation with the Parties, on 22 December, 2009, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, a national of Costa Rica, as the third and presiding arbitrator in this case. On 23 December, 2009, upon Mr. Oreamuno's acceptance of his appointment, the ICSID Secretary-General confirmed that the proceeding had resumed.\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 September, 2010, Ms. Janet Whittaker was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal, following the conclusion of Ms. Katia Yannaca-Small's secondment to ICSID from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.\n\n18.\n\nAn oral hearing on jurisdiction was held at the offices of the World Bank in Washington, DC on 15 and 16 November, 2010. Present at the hearing were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\nMr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, *President*\n\nProf. Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, *Arbitrator* Prof. Brigitte Stern, *Arbitrator* ICSID Secretariat\n\nMs. Janet M.

BACKGROUND**\n-------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn 2 February, 1999, Mr. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas took office as the President of the \"Republic of Venezuela\", as it was then named. Soon after he took office, a Constituent Assembly was appointed to draft a new Political Constitution to replace the 1961 Constitution. The new Constitution was adopted on 20 December, 1999.\n\n24.\n\nAs a result of a sharp decline in the price of oil during 1998, when President Ch\u00e1vez took office in February, 1999, the economy of his country was in a difficult situation. However, by the end of 1998, oil prices had started to increase and, by the end of 1999, oil prices were almost treble those in 1998.1\n\nReply, \u00b6 13.\n\n25.\n\nAs part of its efforts to reactivate the economy, the Government of Venezuela promulgated the Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (LPPI). It was enacted as an \"executive decree with the rank and force of Law\" by President Ch\u00e1vez, exercising the powers vested in him by the new Political Constitution, on 3 October, 1999, and published in the Official Gazette on 22 October, 1999.\n\n26.\n\nAs indicated in paragraphs 11 and 14 of the Award, the Respondent objected to the jurisdiction of ICSID over, and the competence of the Tribunal to resolve, the dispute between the Parties; the Claimant opposed Venezuela's objections and asserted that this Tribunal does have competence to resolve the existing dispute between the Parties.\n\n27.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration filed by Brandes is essentially based on the contention that Article 22 of the LPPI contains the consent of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction. The Respondent asserts that this statement is not correct. In essence, this is the only issue that is before the Tribunal at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered carefully the extensive arguments on factual and legal issues presented by the Parties in their written and oral presentations, as well as the experts' opinions and other documentation provided for the record. All of these documents have been extremely useful to the Tribunal. In this Award, the Tribunal analyzes the Parties' arguments that it considers to be most relevant to its decision about the Respondent's jurisdictional objection referenced at paragraph 27 above. The reasoning of the Tribunal, even when it does not refer expressly to all of the arguments made by the Parties, is based on all of their arguments with respect to the factors considered by the Tribunal to be determinative in deciding this question.\n\n29.\n\nThe Parties based the arguments contained in their written and oral presentations on numerous decisions of other arbitral tribunals and courts. For this reason, the Tribunal considers it to be convenient to set forth some preliminary observations of a general nature on this subject.\n\n30.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considers it to be useful to establish from the outset that it considers that its task at this stage of this proceeding is, specifically, to analyze the scope of Article 22 of the LPPI and other provisions of Venezuelan law, in order to resolve the dispute that has arisen between the Parties about this issue. For this purpose, it shall consider the relationship between Article 22 and other relevant legal norms of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. When interpreting the latter text, the Tribunal shall take into account the provisions of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides in particular that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty, in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the decisions of other arbitral tribunals are decisive in resolving this matter. Furthermore, it is evident that those decisions are not binding on this Tribunal. However, this does not preclude this Tribunal from considering the substance of decisions rendered by other arbitral tribunals, and the arguments of the Parties based on those decisions, to the extent that those decisions may shed light on the issue to be decided at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 22 OF THE LPPI**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal analyzes below the methodologies proposed by each of the Parties for interpreting Article 22 of the LPPI correctly. The article provides as follows:\n\n\"Disputes arising between an international investor, whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement for the promotion and protection of investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration, according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides, without prejudice to the possibility of using, if appropriate, the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect, when applicable.\"2\n\n*See* Ex. R-15.\n\n33.\n\nOpinions have been expressed by the Parties during this proceeding to the effect that the content of Article 22 of the LPPI is clear. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela considers this to be the case, stating that this article does not provide the consent of that State to ICSID jurisdiction. The Claimant maintains that there is no doubt that the article does provide such consent.\n\n34.\n\nDoctrine and jurisprudence addressing the issue of the consent to arbitration have noted that such consent may be given by different means, and have recognized the possibility that it may be expressed not only through national legislation, but also through treaties on the protection of investments:\n\n\"Another technique to give consent to ICSID dispute settlement is a provision in the national legislation of the host State, most often its investment code. Such a provision offers ICSID dispute settlement to foreign investors in general terms. Many capital importing countries have adopted such provisions. Since consent to jurisdiction is always based on an agreement between the parties, the mere existence of such a provision in national legislation will not suffice. The investor may accept the offer in writing at any time while the legislation is in effect. In fact, the acceptance may be made simply by instituting proceedings.\"3\n\n\"As indicated by the Report of the Executive Directors. the drafters of the Convention, which entered into force eight years prior to the enactment of Article 8, anticipated that a State might unilaterally give advance \"consent in writing\" to the Centre's jurisdiction through investment legislation.\"4\n\n*See* Ex. Pellet-18, Christoph Schreuer, *International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, Dispute Settlement, 2.3. Consent to Arbitration*. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2003) at p. 6.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case ARB/84/3), Decision on Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction dated 14 April, 1988 (\"*SPP*\"), \u00b6 98.\n\n35.\n\nAs the Parties to this proceeding have agreed,5 the interpretation of a legal provision and, specifically, in this case, Article 22 of the LPPI, should begin with a **purely grammatical analysis** ; if this initial analysis fails to define clearly the meaning of the provision, it then becomes necessary to examine the **context** in which it was enacted, including a review of other provisions of Venezuelan law relating to the same subject and, in particular, having regard to the hierarchy of norms of the Venezuelan legal system as set forth in the Political Constitution of that State. Other elements that must be used to interpret with clarity the content of Article 22 are the **circumstances** in which it was enacted and the **goals** that it was intended to achieve. The Tribunal shall follow those guidelines in the following analysis.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 42; Reply, \u00b6 42.\n\n36.\n\nGiven that Article 22, insofar as it is relevant to this arbitration, is a unilateral declaration by Venezuela, it is obvious that the initial process of interpretation should be conducted according to the parameters set by the Republic's legal system, starting with the Political Constitution, which is the supreme norm of the State. However, because in the context of this proceeding the outcome of that interpretation has direct effects on the operation of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the conclusions resulting from that initial analysis must be read in accordance with the principles of international law6.\n\n*See also* *Cemex Caracas Investment B.V., Cemex Caracas II Investment B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case ARB/08/15), Decision on Jurisdiction dated 30 December, 2010, \u00b6 79 (\"*Cemex*\") (\"Unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction are standing offers made by a sovereign State to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Such offers could be incorporated into domestic legislation or not. But, whatever may be their form, they must be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention and to the principles of international law governing unilateral declarations of States\".).\n\n37.\n\nArticle 22 refers to the following disputes:\n\na. Those arising between an international investor, whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments;\n\nb. Those to which the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) apply;\n\nc. The disputes to which the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) apply.\n\nThe article provides that such disputes shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides...\n\n38.\n\nAs concerns the first two types of disputes, the Parties agree on the interpretation of the article. They do not agree with respect to the last type. This difference in interpretation is the basis for the dispute being resolved in the Award.\n\n39.\n\nThe Parties performed their own **grammatical analysis** of Article 22 which led them to opposite conclusions.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that:\n\n\"As explained in more detail below, Article 22 of the Investment Law does not constitute consent by the Republic to arbitrate the investment dispute alleged by Claimant \u2026\n\nBy its terms, Article 22 only provides for submission to arbitration 'according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides'. It does not itself constitute a standing, general consent to ICSID jurisdiction of any investment dispute with an investor from a country that is a signatory to the ICSID Convention....\"7\n\nMemorial on Objections, \u00b6 5.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant interprets it in a different manner:\n\n\"A grammatical construction of Article 22 therefore comes to the result that Article 22 is a standing consent to international arbitration with regard to disputes that may fall within the purview of the ICSID Convention. The verb tenses used in Article 22 make clear that the dispute does not already need to be subject to ICSID arbitration for (sic) obligation to submit it to international arbitration to apply. Rather, the dispute must only be one amenable to ICSID arbitration pursuant to the Convention - or one to which the ICSID Convention 'may be applicable'. The combination of the subjunctive mood with regard to the applicability of the ICSID Convention to the dispute and the imperative mood with regard to the submission of the dispute to arbitration unequivocally constitutes a standing ICSID consent by Respondent by the terms to Article 22.\"8\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 53.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant insists that, not only does a grammatical interpretation lead inexorably to the conclusion that Article 22 of the LPPI contains the consent of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction, but also that this position is strengthened by an analysis of the **context** of that article. In this process, it starts by commenting on the provisions of Article 258 of the **Political Constitution** of that country, the terms of which provide that:9\n\n\"The Law shall organize the justice of peace in the communities. Peace Justices shall be elected by universal, direct and secret vote pursuant to law.\n\nThe Law shall promote arbitration, conciliation, mediation and any other alternative means for the settlement of disputes.\"\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 67.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with Brandes' position and asserts that the relevant constitutional provision cannot be used as a basis upon which to claim a unilateral submission by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ICSID, purportedly provided for by Article 22:\n\n\"... Investment Law reflects a consistent policy of expanding domestic, rather than international, arbitral remedies, except in the context of bilateral or multilateral investment treaties granting reciprocal benefits to Venezuelan investors. This preference for Venezuelan arbitration is entirely consistent with both Article 258 of the Constitution, which refers to promotion of multiple forms of alternative dispute resolution within the Venezuelan legal system, and Article 5 of the Investment Law, which requires that Venezuelan investors be given the same treatment as international investors.\"10\n\nReply, \u00b6 85.\n\n44.\n\nIn Brandes' view, other provisions of the LPPI support its assertion that Article 22 provides Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.11 Venezuela does not share that opinion. In order to bolster their respective points of view, the Parties also analyze **other articles of the LPPI.**\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n45.\n\nAccording to Venezuela:\n\n\"Even as so limited, the portion of Article 22's text referring to disputes governed by the ICSID Convention did not define the scope of the dispute to be submitted to arbitration. By contrast, Article 21 referred to disputes 'concerning the interpretation and application of the provisions of this Decree-Law,\" while Article 23 covered 'any dispute arising in connection with the application of this Decree-Law.' Similar language appeared in each of the BITs executed by Venezuela as of October 1999, usually defining the scope of the dispute to be arbitrated in terms of a violation of the terms of the BIT.\"12\n\n\"By giving investors the right to select Venezuelan arbitral tribunals in Article 23, the Republic effectively gave its standing, unilateral consent to national arbitration of disputes arising under the Investment Law. This consent, which was given to both national and foreign investors, represented a significant expansion of rights for investors to the extent that they were offered a forum in which arbitrators of more specialized expertise would consider their claims.\"13\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 32 (emphasis supplied by the Respondent).\n\n46.\n\nBrandes contends the opposite and states that:\n\n\"Provisions of the Investment Law other than Article 22 speak of commercial arbitration in terms of 'may submit' and as such are phrased in terms that are less mandatory than the provision in Article 22. Brandes' argument in its Counter-Memorial and in Professor Caron's expert opinion was *e contrario* : if the legislator would have wished to use optional submission language it could have done so. Thus, Article 18 clearly requires an additional written consent for commercial arbitration to be applicable. Similarly, the reference in Article 23 operates as a \"may\" submit to arbitration.\"14\n\n\"There are also significant questions as to how, structurally, Article 23 would operate as an independent arbitration consent. Thus, one might argue, similar arbitration provisions both require a special juridical stability agreement set out in Article 18 of the Investment Law and are couched in optional terms in Article 23. One therefore could reasonably ask why there would be specific requirements for obtaining a similar commercial arbitration clause as part of an investment agreement that was already applicable as a matter of law? Respondent nevertheless has conceded Article 23 is a standing consent to arbitration. A fortiori, Article 22 also must be considered as consent, given its own mandatory terms.\"15\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 62.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 63.\n\n47.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the context of Article 22 of the LPPI, the Parties refer to the **circumstances** relating to the enactment of that article. They express their positions as set forth in the paragraphs that follow.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent refers to several **decisions of the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice**, and in particular to a decision issued in respect of a Request for Interpretation filed by Hildegard Rond\u00f3n de Sans\u00f3, \u00c1lvaro Silva Calder\u00f3n, Beatrice Sans\u00f3 de Ram\u00edrez *et al*, acting on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, relating to Article 258 of the Political Constitution, (case number 2008-0763), in which the Court examined the text of Article 22 and concluded that:\n\n\"From this it follows then, that the Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments does not contain in itself a general unilateral statement of submission to the international arbitration governed by the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID), ***but refers instead to their content to determine whether arbitration may be resorted to,*** which in the case of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA), is confirmed since its content is express in this respect - *Viz.* Articles 57 and 58 of this Convention and 1, 2 and 4 of Annex II; a situation that does not exist in the case of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention mentioned above (and as it has been unanimously sustained in the international arena, as discussed *supra,* where it has been pointed out that the mere signing of the Convention does not constitute alleged purported unilateral offer).\"16\n\n*See* Ex. RL-18 (English translation provided by the Respondent), Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela, Case No. 2008-0763, 17 October, 2008 at p. 48 (emphasis in the original).\n\n49.\n\nContrary to Venezuela, Brandes questions the objectivity of the decisions of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice upon which the State places so much emphasis and states that:\n\n\"The decision of the constitutional chamber was subject to a dissent. The dissent noted that the ***constitutional*** chamber had not addressed a constitutional question, at all. It concluded that the interpretation of Article 22 had been reached *ultra vires.*\"17\n\n\"On June 16, 2009, the constitutional chamber of the supreme court issued what it styled a 'Nota de Prensa', or press release, purporting to summarize prior rulings on sovereign immunity. In its press release, the constitutional chamber stated that it deemed Respondent immune from enforcement of ICSID awards rendered against Respondent pursuant to Article 22 of the Investment Law. Also by press release, the constitutional chamber purports to ***arrogate*** to Respondent the right to 'denounce or modify the agreement signed before 1999 with other countries in which resolution of disputes was submitted to international bodies'.\"18\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 28 (emphasis supplied by the Tribunal)\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 29 (emphasis supplied by the Tribunal).\n\n50.\n\nOther elements that the Claimant relies upon to support its position that Article 22 contains the consent of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction are the **websites** of the embassies of that country in Korea, Switzerland and the United States, and of its consulate in Barcelona:\n\n\"All of these promotional efforts establish ***first*** that Respondent very much wanted the Investment Law read; ***second*** that it knew of and advertised the importance of international arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism and ***third*** that its statements were express that the Investment Law included an international arbitration mechanism.\n\nAs Respondent explains, such promotional efforts have been recognized as significant in prior ICSID decisions...\"19\n\n\"Venezuela advertised internationally that the Investment Law opened the possibility to resort to international arbitration. For example, the website of the Respondent's Foreign Ministry for its Embassy in Korea...\"20\n\n\"... Respondent's assertions in the Reply are contradicted by its own advertisements to foreign investors. For example, contrary to statements in the Reply, Respondent advertised on the websites of its Embassy in Switzerland and its Consulate in Barcelona, as well as in communications to foreign investors, that 'the policy of promoting investment is a reflection of the constitutional design with regard to economics. The Constitution of 1999 foresaw... a preference for mechanisms of alternative dispute resolution, like arbitration, conciliation and mediation...' In the United States, Respondent's embassy posted similar news reports, stating, for example, 'The Venezuelan Commercial Arbitration Law offers great advantages to our country as a neutral zone for various countries...'.\"21\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 82 (emphasis supplied by the Claimant).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 84.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 5.\n\n51.\n\nVenezuela minimizes the relevance of what is expressed in those websites and states that none of them announces its alleged submission to ICSID jurisdiction:\n\n\"Claimant's Statement of Facts cites no contemporaneous speeches, publications or communications by any governmental officials or agencies indicating that Article 22 of the Investment Law was intended to grant the Republic's unilateral offer of consent to submit all investment disputes to international arbitration before ICSID. Nor does it cite any news articles or commentaries on the Investment Law immediately after its enactment.\"22\n\nReply, \u00b6 33.\n\n52.\n\nIn paragraph 39 of its Rejoinder, Brandes notes that a semi-governmental entity called **CONAPRI** announced the enactment of the LPPI in September 1999. It also stated that the \"'policy of promotion of investments' favoring arbitration was advertised as reflected in the Investment Law which provides for international arbitration against the state as a means of investor-state dispute resolution.\" The same reference is made by Brandes at paragraph 79 of the Rejoinder, where it states that the CONAPRI publication was addressed to foreign investors and referred specifically to dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the statements made by Brandes and maintains that the documents, which Brandes uses to show the existence of a purported announcement that Venezuela consented to ICSID jurisdiction, do not support that assertion. Specifically, it alleges that the CONAPRI bulletin referred to above, which was issued before the enactment of the LPPI, supports the Respondent's position that Article 22 recognized the obligations undertaken under the existing treaties but did not create a new obligation and, therefore, does not constitute an open consent to ICSID arbitration.23\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 36(iv).\n\n54.\n\nVenezuela also added that:\n\n\"There is no evidence that investors or their Venezuelan legal advisors regarded Article 22 as consent to ICSID arbitration or to be of special significance for foreign investors. There was no mention of this possibility, for example, in the March 2000 study titled 'Legal Regime for Foreign Investment in Venezuela,' which was published by the National Council for the Promotion of Investments (CONAPRI), a public-private entity established to promote investments in Venezuela.\"24\n\nReply, \u00b6 34.\n\n55.\n\nIn several of its presentations, Brandes referred to certain materials that it referred to as \"contemporaneous documentary evidence.\"25 It asserts that the note published on 30 April, 1999, by the Central Office of the Presidency for Coordination and Planning (\"**CORDIPLAN**\"), was \". the equivalent of legislative history given that Article 22 was an executive decree for which CORDIPLAN had responsibility.\"26\n\n*See* Letter from Brandes to the Tribunal dated 10 January, 2011 with respect to the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Cemex* at p. 2.\n\n*Id*., at pp. 3-4.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees completely with this position and says, in brief, the following:\n\n\"The statements attributed to then President-elect Chavez at the January 8, 1999 meeting (Ex. C-10) and the commentary in the CORDIPLAN Economic Transition Plan (Ex. C-30) are general in nature and make no mention of Article 22.\"27\n\n*See* Letter from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the Tribunal dated 10 January, 2011 with respect to the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Cemex* at p. 2.\n\n57.\n\nThe Parties have discussed extensively the relevance of Mr. **Werner Corrales' positions** to the interpretation of Article 22 of the LPPI. As part of its explanation of the circumstances in which the law was enacted, the Claimant contends that, in his publication entitled \"Some Ideas Concerning the Design of a Legal Regime of Promotion and Protection of Investments in Venezuela\",28 Mr. Corrales, who was a government official involved in the drafting of the LPPI, affirms that the law contains the consent of Venezuela to ICSID arbitration.29 Elsewhere in its Counter-Memorial, Brandes emphasizes the important role played by Mr. Corrales and by his publication, as support for its assertion that the LPPI contains the unilateral consent of Venezuela to ICSID arbitration.30\n\n*See* Ex. C-32,\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 3, fn. 6.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 83, fn. 230.\n\n58.\n\nLikewise, in several parts of its Rejoinder, in particular, at paragraph 21, Brandes notes that Mr. Corrales, like other officials of the Government of Venezuela, confirmed that Article 22 of the LPPI was drafted to provide for Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction. At footnote number 64 to that paragraph, Brandes refers not only to the publication entitled \"Some Ideas Concerning the Design of a Legal Regime of Promotion and Protection of Investments in Venezuela\", but also to another publication made by Mr. Corrales, together with Mrs. Marta Rivera, entitled \"Some Ideas on the New Regime of Promotion and Protection of Investments in Venezuela\",31 and to a lecture by Mr. Corrales at CEDCA.32\n\n*See* Ex. C-6.\n\n*See* Ex. C-11.\n\n59.\n\nAt paragraph 99 of its Reply, Venezuela minimizes the authority of Mr. Corrales and refers to him as \"an economist described by Claimant as a 'drafter of the Investment Law'\"; in the paragraphs that follow, Venezuela expresses its opinion about him. In paragraph 101, it adds that in the decade following the enactment of the LPPI, \". Mr. Corrales played no discernable role in promoting or commenting upon the Investment Law\" and minimizes his involvement in the drafting of this law and his ability to comment on it objectively.\n\n60.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Memorial, the Respondent insists on questioning Mr. Corrales' ability to interpret Article 22 and points out that he did not make a declaration as a witness in *Mobil v. Venezuela* or in any other case.33\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 34, fn. 71.\n\n61.\n\nIn their efforts to interpret the true meaning of Article 22 of the LPPI, the Parties also analyze the **historical circumstances** in which that law was enacted. In its Counter-Memorial,34 Brandes describes the circumstances prevailing in Venezuela in 1999. In particular, it refers to the following facts:\n\na. There was a capital flight, which was accelerated as a result of the election of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.35\n\nb. The negotiations to conclude a BIT between Venezuela and the United States of America (at that time Venezuela's most important commercial partner) had ceased.36\n\nc. When President Ch\u00e1vez took office \". Venezuelan heavy crude continued to trade below US$10-a-barrel, a level that provided comparatively little commercial incentive to U.S. investors to shoulder significant Venezuelan political risk.\"37\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 8-13.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 3.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 9.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 10.\n\n62.\n\nIn Brandes' view, these circumstances and the pressing need to attract foreign investment to its territory led the Respondent to make the concession to submit to ICSID arbitration that is contained in Article 22:\n\n\"The law was prepared while BIT negotiations with the United States, Venezuela's largest trading partner, were stalling. Its stated purpose was to attract foreign investment and provide a stable investment environment - a purpose turned urgent by the capital flight from Venezuela exacerbated by the election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to the presidency. The context confirms that Article 22 was meant as a consent to arbitrate investment disputes arising under the law with foreign, and particularly US investors in a neutral forum such as ICSID while such foreign investors were not yet protected by bilateral investment treaties.\"38\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 37.\n\n63.\n\nBrandes concludes that, if the LPPI is analyzed in light of the historical circumstances in which it was enacted, its objective to attract foreign investors becomes evident. Brandes asserts that, for this reason, it was structured in a manner similar to bilateral investment treaties (providing for the definition of an international investment, fair and equal treatment, no discrimination between international and national investors, most favored nation treatment, etc.). It concludes that, for this reason, there is no doubt that Article 22 provides Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration, which is characteristic of bilateral investment treaties.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with this statement and asserts that, although the LPPI had the clear purpose of attracting investors, the economic situation of the country at that time was not as serious as that described by the Claimant.39 It adds that the prices of oil - a product that is essential to the Venezuelan economy - had increased strongly in the months during which the LPPI was discussed.40\n\nReply, \u00b6 15.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 13.\n\n65.\n\nAt paragraphs 12 to 15 of its Reply, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela categorically opposes the analysis made by Brandes and states that it ignores the fact that the price of oil almost trebled during the period between December 1998 and December 1999, thereby completely changing that country's economy (it asserts that the price was US$8.85 per barrel in December 1998, increasing to US$25 at the end of 1999).\n\n66.\n\nVenezuela concludes at paragraph 15 that, although the purpose of the LPPI was to encourage foreign investment, the economic circumstances of the country were not so bad as to make a unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration necessary to achieve that purpose.\n\n67.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Memorials, both Parties reiterate their respective points of view. Brandes notes at paragraph 23 that in August 1999, CORDIPLAN issued a publication stating that the recession suffered by the country was \"the worst in forty years\" and, concluded that a massive foreign investment was required to combat this recession. Venezuela, in paragraph 24 of its Post-Hearing Memorial, reaches the opposite conclusion:. Claimant has failed to prove that the economic situation prevailing in Venezuela in 1999, occasioned by a collapse in oil prices, was so calamitous that the Government had no choice but to give an unprecedented unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration of all investment disputes in order to attract foreign investment.\"\n\n68.\n\nThe issue of what **goals** the Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments was intended to achieve is closely related to the historical circumstances in which the law was enacted. The Parties agree that the general purpose of the law was to attract foreign investment to Venezuela. However, aside from this initial agreement, they disagree entirely as to the key issue under discussion: namely, whether Article 22 of the LPPI provides for the unilateral consent of Venezuela to ICSID arbitration.\n\n69.\n\nBrandes maintains in its Counter-Memorial that \". viewed in its context, it is apparent that Article 22 was meant to function as an ICSID consent. Article 22 is part of a decree which is structured like, and provides similar protections than a bilateral investment treaty does, and therefore would reasonably be expected to provide comparable dispute resolution provisions.\"41\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 37.\n\n70.\n\nVenezuela agrees with Brandes that the purpose of the LPPI was to attract foreign investment, but does not accept that Article 22 of that law constitutes a unilateral submission on its part to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n71.\n\nOn the basis of its analysis of several decisions of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, at paragraphs 44 to 49 of its Memorial on Objections, asserts that consent to arbitration must be \"**manifest, clear, and unequivocal**.\"\n\n72.\n\nIn support of its contention, Venezuela also quotes the decision on jurisdiction issued on 8 February, 2005 in the case of *Plama Consortium Limited v. the Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case ARB/03/24, \u00b6 198), in which the tribunal stated the following:\n\n\"It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that such an agreement (of the parties to submit a matter to arbitration) should be clear and unambiguous.\"\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, as expressed by Dr. Allan Brewer-Carias, in paragraph 43 of his report,42 \"there is no legal provision in Venezuelan law requiring the consent for arbitration or the arbitration agreement to be clear and unequivocal.\"\n\n*See* Declaration of Allan R. Brewer-Carias, 26 June, 2009.\n\n74.\n\nBrandes adds that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention only establishes one requirement for consent: namely, that it be granted in writing. It also states that the Report of the Executive Directors of the ICSID Convention confirms that there are no additional requirements or standards of \"clarity\" to express consent.43\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 70.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent claimed that, throughout its history, Venezuela has shown a certain degree of **hostility toward arbitration** :\n\n\"Professor Morles Hern\u00e1ndez reviewed the history of arbitration in Venezuela at length. He stated: Venezuela is a country which belongs to a region traditionally viewed as resistant and even hostile towards arbitration, as is the Latin American region. Furthermore, it is the region in the world which has been the slowest to accept this method of dispute resolution.\"44\n\nReply, \u00b6 89.\n\n76.\n\nIn this respect, Brandes states that:\n\n\"Finally, Respondent argues that the lack of promotional efforts on the part of Respondent either on the Investment Law as a whole or its dispute resolution mechanism means that it did not contain a standing consent to international arbitration. Respondent further alleges that this is consistent with its \"traditional hostility\" toward international arbitration. Neither statement by Respondent reflects the actual state of the promotional efforts that were ongoing at the time.\"45\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant adds that:\n\n\"Respondent's main contextual argument alleges that Article 22 must be read against a purported hostility to arbitration in Venezuela in 1999. Contrary to Respondent's submission in the arbitration, 'hostility' to arbitration is not relevant to the intent of Article 22.\n\n\u2022 Respondent in fact admitted that the subject matter of the Investment Law is arbitrable (Slide 128).\n\n\u2022 The same subject matter was subject to international arbitration in BITs (Slide 128).\n\n\u2022 Respondent conceded that key oil agreements concluded before 1999 contained ICC arbitration clauses (Slide 128).\n\n\u2022 Respondent's postings on embassy websites flatly contradict this statement, advertising that Venezuela is the best country for international arbitration (Slide 129)..\"46\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 35.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that:\n\n\u2022 \"The Investment Law was an emergency measure, and as such not business as usual. A generalized hostility thus is not competent context for a specific emergency measure (Slide 128).\n\n\u2022 Professor Brewer Carias further explained that the statements relied on by Respondent were taken out of context and referred to a historical attitude in the past and not contemporaneous sentiments about international arbitration in Venezuela.\n\nHostility to arbitration therefore is neither established nor is part of the circumstances of preparation of Article 22. This assertion is thus not relevant to an international law interpretation of Article 22.\"47\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 35.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAs defined by the Parties at the first session of the Tribunal, at this stage of the proceeding, the Tribunal shall limit itself to the analysis of Article 22 of the LPPI. Other issues, even if related to the Tribunal's jurisdiction were deferred for resolution, together with the substantive issues.48 Consequently, the role of the Tribunal at this stage of the proceeding is only to decide whether Article 22 of the Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments contains the consent of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n*See* Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties dated 23 April, 2009.\n\n80.\n\nThe Parties discussed extensively whether the interpretation of Article 22 should be made pursuant to the principles and rules of Venezuelan law or under the principles of international law. Venezuela maintains the first position and Brandes the latter.\n\n81.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that, in view of the fact that Article 22 of the LPPI is a unilateral declaration of the Venezuelan State, it is necessary that the initial process of interpretation be conducted within the parameters set by the Republic's legal system, based on its Political Constitution, which is the supreme norm of that country. However, because any conclusions that may be reached in the process of interpretation of that article must be applied to determine whether Venezuela granted its consent to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, it is necessary to take account of the principles of International Law to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\n82.\n\nThis approach has been taken by other arbitral tribunals:\n\n\"... the jurisdictional issue in this case involves more than interpretation of municipal legislation. The issue is whether certain unilaterally enacted legislation has created an international obligation under a multilateral treaty. Resolution of this issue involves both statutory interpretation and treaty interpretation. Thus in deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case, Law N\u00b0 43 constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general principles of statutory interpretation taking into consideration, where appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations.\"49\n\n\"Legislation and more generally unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction must be considered as standing offers to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Those unilateral acts must accordingly be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention itself and to the rules of international law governing unilateral declarations of State's.\"50\n\n*SPP*, \u00b6 61.\n\n*Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V. et al v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case ARB/07/27), Decision on Jurisdiction dated 10 June, 2010, \u00b6 85 (\"*Mobil*\").\n\n83.\n\nIn the course of this proceeding, the Claimant and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in their written and oral presentations, have made significant efforts to interpret Article 22 from **a** grammatical perspective. As part of its efforts, Brandes has asserted that this article provides for Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction. However, despite its assertion that it is clear, it devotes many pages and much time to reinforce its conclusion that the article contains the Republic's consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n84.\n\nVenezuela also offers a grammatical interpretation and reaches the opposite conclusion, namely, that the State did not consent to ICSID jurisdiction by means of Article 22 of the LPPI.\n\n85.\n\nIn spite of the laborious and thorough efforts of the Parties to scrutinize the meaning of Article 22 through grammatical interpretation, the Tribunal considers it to be unnecessary, for the reasons expressed in the next paragraph, to summarize precisely in the Award what the Claimant and the Respondent stated with respect to their grammatical analyses of that article.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal has assessed very carefully the written and oral interpretations of the Parties concerning the content of Article 22 of the LPPI and the opinions of their respective experts about this matter. Its conclusion is that the wording of Article 22 of the LPPI is confusing and imprecise, and that it is not possible to affirm, based on a grammatical interpretation, whether or not it contains the consent of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n87.\n\nIn view of what is stated in the paragraph above, the Tribunal will analyze the **context** of Article 22, the **circumstances** in which the LPPI was enacted and the **goals** that its enactment sought to achieve.\n\n88.\n\nTo start this process, the Tribunal considers it to be essential to analyze other articles of the LPPI, which constitute the immediate context for Article 22.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal observes first that, in fact, as pointed out by Brandes, the law has the characteristic structure and contents of many bilateral investment treaties. The following provisions confirm this assertion:\n\na. international investments shall be entitled to fair and equal treatment, in accordance with international law standards and criteria, and shall not be subject to arbitrary or discriminatory measures...\" (Article 6);\n\nb. \"... international investors... shall have the same rights and obligations as those to which national investments and investors are entitled in similar circumstances...\" (Article 7);\n\nc. \"There shall be no discrimination in treatment between international investments or investors because of the country of origin of their capital.\" (Article 8);\n\nd. \"International investments and investors shall be entitled to the most favorable treatment...\" (Article 9); and\n\ne. \"No confiscation shall be ordered or enforced, except in the exceptional cases provided for by the Constitution; and, as concerns the investments of international investors, by international law. Expropriations of investments or measures equivalent to an expropriation may only be made for causes of public or social interest, following the procedure legally established for these purposes, in a non-discriminatory manner and by means of a prompt, fair and adequate compensation.\" (Article 11).\n\n90.\n\nWhen reading the transcribed texts, several facts call one's attention:\n\na. The quoted provisions are actually similar to those usually appearing in a bilateral investment treaty;\n\nb. They are written in a direct language, which is easily understandable by any reader;\n\nc. If the drafters of those texts were able to express those ideas so clearly, why did they fail to do the same when establishing a fundamental guaranty for an investor such as ICSID arbitration?; and\n\nd. Articles 18.4 and 21 of the LPPI also refer to several forms of arbitration in a precise and clear manner.\n\n91.\n\nDespite the similarities between the content of the LPPI and that of a BIT, the Tribunal does not find in the article that it has analyzed nor in any other article of the LPPI, any provision that would allow it to assert that it provides for Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n92.\n\nThe clarity of most provisions of the LPPI contrast with the confusing and ambiguous wording of Article 22. This fact obviously weakens the assertion made by Brandes that Venezuela consented to ICSID jurisdiction by means of Article 22.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal indicated in the foregoing paragraphs that the content of the LPPI is very similar to that of several bilateral investment treaties. Therefore, it considers it to be appropriate to note for purposes of its analysis of the context of Article 22 that, at the time of the enactment of the LPPI, the Respondent had entered into bilateral investment treaties with the following countries: the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Switzerland, Portugal, Barbados, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, The Czech Republic, Spain, Per\u00fa, Germany, Canada, Paraguay and Sweden.51 It subsequently entered into other similar treaties with The United Mexican States and with The Republic of Colombia.52\n\n*See* Ex. RL-5, Table, Consents to Arbitration in Venezuelan Bilateral Investment Treaties in Force as of October 1999. *See also* Reply \u00b6 55, fn. 81.\n\n*Id*.\n\n94.\n\nObviously, for purposes of the Award, the analysis of each of those bilateral investment treaties is unnecessary. However, the Tribunal notes that each of these treaties contains a submission to ICSID jurisdiction expressed in a similar manner, and in clear and precise language.\n\n95.\n\nAs part of its analysis of the context of Article 22, which is aimed at establishing its meaning, the Tribunal has studied the Parties' analyses of the provisions of the Political Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, but could find only one provision that is relevant for the purposes of this proceeding. It is Article 258, which reads as follows in English:\n\n\"The Law shall organize the justice of peace in the communities. Peace Justices shall be elected by universal, direct and secret vote pursuant to law.\n\nThe Law shall promote arbitration, conciliation, mediation and any other alternative means for the settlement of disputes.\"\n\n96.\n\nAlthough the provision quoted above is clear with respect to arbitration, it is evident that the consent of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction cannot be inferred from this constitutional language.\n\n97.\n\nThe analysis of the context of Article 22 could be completed with the examination of other provisions of the Venezuelan legal system which may shed light on this issue. Nevertheless, the Parties did not submit arguments based on those supposed provisions. Accordingly, the Tribunal assumes that there is no other legal text issued by the relevant authorities of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that may help to clarify the issue discussed in the Award.\n\n98.\n\nAs noted at paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Award, the Respondent attributes great importance to several decisions of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which concluded that the LPPI does not contain the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration. This Tribunal has examined very thoroughly the content of the decisions of the highest court of Venezuela as cited by the Parties but reaffirms that such decisions are not binding on this Tribunal with respect to their interpretation of Article 22.\n\n99.\n\nIn addition to what is stated in the paragraph above, the Tribunal considers that the decisions of the Venezuelan authorities are not determinative for the purpose of resolving this dispute. The same conclusion was reached by the tribunal in *Cemex v. Venezuela*, which concluded that:\n\n\"The Tribunal adds that the same solution has been retained by the Permanent Court of Justice and the International Court of Justice which have made clear that a sovereign State's interpretation of its own unilateral consent to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal is not binding on the tribunal or determinative of jurisdictional issues. Thus the interpretation given to Article 22 by Venezuelan authorities or by Venezuelan courts cannot control the Tribunal's decision on its competence.\"53\n\n*Cemex*, \u00b6 70 (citing *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria* (Preliminary Objections) (Belgium v. Bulgaria) dated 4 April, 1939, PCIJ Reports, Ser. A/B No. 77 (1989); *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf* (Greece v. Turkey) dated 19 December, 1978, ICJ Reports (1978) at p. 3; *Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada) dated 4 December, 1998, ICJ Reports (1988) at p. 432). *See also* *Mobil*, \u00b6 75.\n\n100.\n\nBrandes maintains that, in its eagerness to attract foreign investors, the Respondent announced and publicized in different ways the enactment of the LPPI, and also underscored that, in several of its announcements, Venezuela emphasized the fact that this law favored arbitration. Among the mechanisms which the Respondent - according to Brandes - used for this purpose, are the websites of its embassies in the United States of America, Korea and Switzerland, as well as that of its consulate in Barcelona. The Tribunal has analyzed those references thoroughly and has failed to find in them any express manifestation by the Respondent of its consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n101.\n\nOther instruments used by Venezuela to inform prospective investors about the enactment of the Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments were the publications of the National Council of Promotion of Investments (CONAPRI), an entity established to promote investments in Venezuela. The Parties also disagree about the scope of those publications, as noted at paragraphs 52, 53, and 54 of the Award. Leaving aside the issue of whether a non-governmental entity such as CONAPRI could express the intention of the Venezuelan government, the Tribunal has not found in the CONAPRI publications filed in the record, any assertion that supports the statement that Article 22 provides for Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n102.\n\nIn the Tribunal's judgment, neither CORDIPLAN's publications nor the relationship of that entity with Mr. Werner Corrales may be used as a basis to support the statement made by Brandes that Article 22 of the LPPI provides for Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n103.\n\nAs set forth above at paragraphs 57 and 58, Brandes insists on ascribing a dominant role in the drafting of the LPPI to Mr. Werner Corrales. To the contrary, as described at paragraphs 59 and 60 above, Venezuela questions his objectivity and the role that he allegedly played in the drafting of the LPPI. The Tribunal considers it to be unnecessary, for purposes of resolving this dispute, to establish the actual role played by Mr. Corrales in the drafting of the LPPI, his knowledge of the issue under discussion and the relevance of his publications about this issue. What is apparent to the Tribunal is that Mr. Corrales' opinion cannot provide the basis for finding that Article 22 of the LPPI contains the consent of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to submit to ICSID arbitration.\n\n104.\n\nAt paragraphs 61 to 67 above, the Tribunal summarizes the positions of the Parties concerning the economic situation in Venezuela in 1999 and the influence that those circumstances may have had on the enactment of the LPPI. The Tribunal has no doubt that, in view of the difficulty of concluding a bilateral investment treaty with the United States of America, Venezuela sought several mechanisms to attract investors and the LPPI was one of those instruments.\n\n105.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal understands Venezuela's eagerness to attract foreign investment to its territory, it does not consider it to be logical to find that Venezuela - which was already having many disagreements with the United States of America - was willing, as Brandes has asserted, to grant a broad unilateral consent to ICSID jurisdiction without any reciprocity. This point of view is especially difficult to accept considering that many of the prospective investors would have been companies of the United States of America.\n\n106.\n\nIt may be correct to assert, as the Respondent does,54 that due to particular historical circumstances the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, like some other Latin American countries, traditionally did not favor arbitration. However, this assertion does not necessarily lead to the conclusion reached by Venezuela that, in view of this historical attitude, it is possible to ascertain that Article 22 does not provide the consent of that State to ICSID arbitration. There are other valid arguments to support the contention that Article 22 of the LPPI does not provide for such consent, but such alleged hostility toward arbitration is not one of them.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 89-91.\n\n107.\n\nBased on the decisions of its highest court, Venezuela states categorically, in several of its presentations that the consent to arbitration has to be **manifest, clear, and unequivocal**. The Claimant maintains that there is no provision that requires the consent to ICSID jurisdiction to have those characteristics and that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention only requires that consent be expressed in writing. In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal addresses this fundamental difference between the Parties.\n\n108.\n\nArticle 253 of the Political Constitution provides that:\n\n\"The power to administer justice emanates from the citizens and is exercised in the name of the Republic by the authority of the Law.\n\nThe bodies comprising the Judicial Power shall deal with the cases and matters within their competence, through the procedures determined by law, and shall execute or enforce their judgments....\"\n\n109.\n\nAccordingly, it is evident that the general rule in Venezuela is that the function of administering justice is entrusted to the State, which performs it through the courts.\n\n110.\n\nIt is also an unquestionable fact that the basis for arbitration is consent.55 There cannot be an arbitration, national or international, *ad hoc* or institutional, before ICSID or any other entity that administers arbitration proceedings, if the parties do not agree to arbitrate.\n\n*See* Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 18 March, 1965, (\"Consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre. Consent to jurisdiction must be in writing and once given cannot be withdrawn unilaterally (Article 25(1)).\").\n\n111.\n\nThe statement made in the previous paragraph is definitive. Even in the case of a dispute between private citizens, the rule is that they must settle their disputes in court. The exception is that, only if they agree, they may resolve their dispute through arbitration. If this is true in the ambit of private law, it is even more so when a State is involved, because when a State submits to arbitration proceedings, it is waiving the possibility of resorting to its own courts.\n\n112.\n\nAs expressed in a well-known award:\n\n\"Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is by no means an exception to the law of the land. It is limited to defining the conditions of ICSID jurisdiction, which include the fundamental condition of consent. Without doubt, the consent to an arbitration proceeding constitutes a renunciation or a derogation from the right to have recourse to national courts. Therefore such consent should not be presumed.\"56\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels v. Republic of Senegal* (ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1), Award dated 25 February, 1988, \u00b6 4.09.\n\n113.\n\nEven if there is no requirement that consent to ICSID arbitration should have any characteristic other than to be expressed in writing in accordance with Article 25 of the Convention, it is self-evident that such consent should be expressed in a manner that leaves no doubts.\n\n114.\n\nBrandes has argued repeatedly that this Tribunal had information before it (namely, CORDIPLAN's and CONAPRI's documents),57 that the arbitral tribunals in the *Cemex* and *Mobil* cases did not have. This Tribunal has examined the relevant information thoroughly, as well as Brandes' arguments in this regard, and has not found anything that may lead it to depart from the conclusions arrived at by those tribunals with respect to the specific matter at issue here.\n\n*See* Letter from Brandes to the Tribunal dated 10 January, 2011 at pp. 4-5; Brandes' presentation at the Hearing on 15-16 November, 2010 at pp. 43 and 124.\n\n115.\n\nThis Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the conclusions reached by these two tribunals in comparable cases as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal thus arrives to the conclusion that such intention is not established. As a consequence, it cannot conclude from the ambiguous text of Article 22 that Venezuela, in adopting the 1999 Investment Law, consented in advance to ICSID arbitration for all disputes covered by the ICSID Convention. That article does not provide a basis for jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present case.\"58\n\n*Mobil*, \u00b6 140; *Cemex*, \u00b6 138.\n\n116.\n\nAlthough in connection with the interpretation of the verb \"to submit\", contained in Article 22 of the LPPI Brandes referred briefly to the principle of *effet utile*,59 the Tribunal considers that its interpretation of Article 22 in the foregoing paragraphs does not contravene that principle in any way.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 62.\n\n117.\n\nTo refute one of Venezuela's arguments, Brandes refers in its Rejoinder to the notification about the LPPI made by the Respondent to ICSID in 2000,60 and to the fact that the enactment of that law was communicated to the World Trade Organization. The Tribunal does not find in those documents any statement by Venezuela to the effect that Article 22 provides for its consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 36.\n\n118.\n\nBased on the findings in the paragraphs above, in the Tribunal's opinion, it is obvious that Article 22 of the Law on Promotion and Protection of Investments does not contain the consent of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction. Therefore, this Tribunal lacks competence to resolve the dispute that has been submitted to it.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n119.\n\nWhile the Respondent prevails to the effect that this Tribunal finds that it does not have competence in this case, each Party has prevailed in respect of a number of the arguments that it put forward.\n\n120.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal, in accordance with Art. 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, concludes that the Parties shall bear on an equal basis the fees and expenses of the members of this Arbitral Tribunal and the fees and expenses of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, and that each party shall bear the fees and expenses incurred by it in relation to this proceeding.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n121.\n\nFor the above reasons and pursuant to Articles 41, 48 and 61 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and ICSID Arbitration Rules 41 and 47, the Arbitral Tribunal declares unanimously that:\n\na. The objection to the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes made by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is admitted.\n\nb. Accordingly, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes has no jurisdiction to hear this matter and this Arbitral Tribunal has no competence to decide the merits of the case.\n\nc. The Parties shall bear on an equal basis the fees and expenses of the members of this Arbitral Tribunal, and of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\nd. Each party shall bear the fees and expenses incurred by it in relation to this proceeding."}]}
