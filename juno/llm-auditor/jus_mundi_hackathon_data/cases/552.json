I looked at the case as if jurisdiction existed. I do not comment in this opinion on the merits phase, but for stating that I subscribe to the results of the Award on the substantive issues raised.\n\n3.\n\nThe question of the scope of MFN clauses in BITs is a complex issue, especially when related to the provisions on dispute settlement mechanisms. In a study of UNCTAD, it is stated that \"there are strong arguments both for and against applying the MFN clause to dispute settlement. In the end, this issue may need further clarification by international investment jurisprudence.\"1 I think this is a good case to foster that clarification. Unfortunately, to take the words of my colleague arbitrator Pedro Nikken, \"I have not had the intelligence or the ability to convince my colleagues in this Tribunal,\"2 but in pursuing the intense and thought provoking discussions we had among the members of the Tribunal, I express the hope to contribute in a modest but constructive manner to the ongoing debate on the way MFN clauses should be applied in investment arbitration.\n\nBILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES 1995-2006 *:* TRENDS IN INVESTMENT RULEMAKING, UNCTAD/ITE/IIA/2006/5, UN Pub.

Nevertheless, in cases where the MFN clause has referred to \"all matters\" or \"any matter\" regulated in the BIT, there has been near-unanimity in finding that the clause covered the dispute settlement rules. *On this basis*, the majority of the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Impregilo is entitled to rely, in this respect, on the dispute settlement rules in the Argentina-US BIT and that the case cannot be dismissed for non-observance of the requirements in Article 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.3\n\nAward, \u00a7 108. Emphasis added.\n\n5.\n\nIn fact, it might be emphasized that, concerning all the cases dealing with MFN clauses and dispute settlement, it becomes apparent, if one looks at the number of arbitrators that are in favour of applying the MFN clause to dispute settlement rather than at the number of awards, that the picture looks almost balanced, because of the repeated involvement of some of the arbitrators. In any case, it does not appear to me to be a legally convincing argument to rely on former cases as if they were binding precedents.\n\n6.\n\nThis being said, it is well known that it is *Maffezini*4 that opened the floodgates of this controversy, in taking an unprecedented decision.5 As has been noted by Zachary Douglas, \"(t)he decision in *Maffezini* was the first time that a party has been permitted to rely upon an MFN clause to modify the jurisdictional mandate of an international tribunal. Across the hundreds of years of activity of international courts and tribunals leading up to *Maffezini*, there had only been judicial pronouncements against such a device, including the International Court of Justice's judgment in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Case* and the British-Venezuelan Mixed Claims Commission's decision in *Aroa Mines*.\"6 After *Maffezini*, some ICSID tribunals have however followed that path, as has the majority of this Tribunal.\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Award on Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000.\n\nWith the exception of an *obiter dictum* of the International Court of Justice in the *Case Concerning the Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco* (France v.

Jordan*7 and *Plama v. Bulgaria*8, which in turn were followed by some ICSID tribunals.\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 9 November 2004.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005.\n\n8.\n\nArticle 3 containing the MFN clause and Article 8 relating to the settlement of disputes of the Argentina/Italy BIT, which is the basic treaty, are cited here in their relevant parts for the convenience of reference:\n\n*Article 3. National Treatment and Most-favored Nation Provisions*\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in its own territory, accord to investment made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the returns and activities related thereto and to all other matters regulated by this Agreement, a treatment not less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of third countries.\n\n*ARTICLE 8. Settlement of Disputes between Investors and Contracting Parties*\n\n1. Any dispute regarding an investment between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, regarding the issues regulated by this Agreement, shall, as far as possible, be settled through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If these consultations do not result in a solution, the dispute may be submitted to the competent judicial or administrative courts of the Party in whose territory the investment is located.\n\n3. If, after eighteen months from the date of notice of commencement of proceedings before the courts mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the dispute between an investor and one of the Contracting Parties continues to exist, it may be submitted to international arbitration.\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimant, wishing to avoid the obligation to submit its dispute to the courts of Argentina during 18 months, attempted - and so succeeded - to use the MFN clause of Article 3 in order to be able to present its case directly to international arbitration. In doing so, it relied on one discrete procedural aspect of a *completely different procedure* for the settlement of investment disputes set out in Article VII of the Argentina/US BIT, which is the third-party treaty, and which provides that:\n\n2.... in the event of an investment dispute, the parties should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such convention: or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNICTRAL): or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n10.\n\nIt can be noted at the outset that the dispute settlement procedure in the basic treaty to be applied in our case, the Argentina/Italy BIT, is fundamentally different from the one in the third-party treaty, the Argentina/US BIT, one *requiring* to go to local courts before having access to international arbitration, the other *forbidding* to go to local courts before having access to international arbitration, as was well explained by the tribunal in *Wintershall*,9 when dealing with similar clauses. This being so, it is not easy, to say the least, to compare the procedures in the basic treaty and in the third-party treaty in order to decide which one is the more favorable for the investment's protection. In other words, it seems quite plain to me that importing just a time limit from one mechanism into the other does not really make any sense, as it cannot be based on a serious comparison between the two clauses whose underlying *rationale* is completely different.\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award of 8 December 2008, \u00a7 175.\n\n11.\n\nAccording to the majority position, the question is \"whether a *choice* between domestic proceedings and international arbitration, as in the Argentina-US BIT, is more favourable to the investor than compulsory domestic proceedings before access is opened to arbitration.\" And the majority does not hesitate: \"The answer to this question is in general, and certainly in this case, evident: a system that gives a choice is more favourable to the investor than a system that gives no choice.\"10 This seems a rather quick conclusion11: it is suggested here that it could as well be contended that a system which gives the possibility to use *cumulatively* two different fora (although one being delayed by 18 months) is more favourable than a system that obliges to elect only one possibility to the detriment of the other.\n\nAward, \u00a7 101. Emphasis in the original.\n\nWhich might be explained by the postulate, shared by investors, that international arbitration is necessarily to be preferred to national courts, which idea has been criticized in some doctrinal comments. See Campbell McLachlan, Laurence Shore *&* Matthew Weiniger, INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ARBITRATION, Oxford, Oxford U. Press, 2007, p. 257, where it is noted: \"It would be invidious for international tribunals to be finding... that host State adjudication of treaty rights was necessarily inferior to international arbitration.\"\n\n12.\n\nIt can be added that the concrete result is not to grant Impregilo the most favourable existing dispute settlement mechanism, which is the purported objective of MFN clauses, but it is to grant it a *sui generis* mechanism that was constructed by the reasoning of the arbitrators forming the majority and was envisaged neither in the basic treaty nor in the third-party treaty. In fact, as was indeed also the case for example in *Siemens*, Impregilo was at the end of the day in a better position than would have been either an investor under the Argentina/Italy BIT or an investor under the Argentina US/BIT, as it was not restricted in its access to international arbitration by an 18 months waiting period on the one hand, nor in its choices by the fork-in-the road provision on the other hand. *Stricto sensu*, Impregilo was not granted by the Award the most favoured treatment, it was granted an inexistent favourable treatment. The foreign investor had the best of both treaties, but this did not correspond to any real situation under any treaty.\n\n13.\n\nThis being said, I would like to take this opportunity to present some more general remarks on the cases having dealt with this question and to propose some avenues for dealing with the question of MFN clauses in international investment law.\n\n14.\n\nTo be clear, I am very strongly convinced that MFN clauses should not apply to dispute settlement mechanisms and I therefore disagree with the result arrived at in the *Maffezini* and *al.* cases12 and consequently concur with the result arrived at in the *Plama* and *al*. cases. In fact, the first line of cases is based on the presumption that dispute-resolution provisions do invariably fall within the scope of an MFN provision in a BIT, unless the contrary is plainly demonstrated, the second line of cases on the reverse presumption that dispute-resolution provisions do never fall within the scope of an MFN provision in a BIT, unless the contrary is plainly demonstrated.\n\nSee my article criticizing *Maffezini*, written before the *Plama* decision, \"ICSID Arbitration and the State's Increasingly Remote Consent : Apropos the *Maffezini* Case\", *in* Steve Charnovitz, Debra Steger & Peter Van den Bossche (eds), LAW IN THE SERVICE OF HUMAN DIGNITY. ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF FLORENTINO FELICIANO, Cambridge, Cambridge U. Press, 2005, pp. 246-260.\n\n15.\n\nAlthough I am in full agreement with the second line of cases, I am however not totally convinced by the reasoning on which the different decisions are based, which probably do not explain in a fully satisfactory manner the solution reached. In other words, although all the decisions refusing to use an MFN clause, in order to import a dispute settlement mechanism or to modify it, point to certain important aspects of the context to be taken into account when interpreting such a clause, none fully explains, in my view, the result arrived at.\n\n16.\n\nThe purpose of this separate opinion is to try to explain why, in principle, an MFN clause cannot import, in part or *in toto*, a dispute settlement mechanism from a third party BIT into the BIT which is the basic treaty applicable to the dispute. Ultimately, as will be explained in more details below, the core reason why an MFN clause cannot apply to dispute settlement is intimately linked with the essence of international law.\n\n17.\n\nNaturally, an important *caveat* has to be presented here. The interpretation of the MFN clause is only necessary when the intention of the parties concerning its applicability or inapplicability to the dispute settlement mechanism is not expressly stated or clearly ascertained. It is quite evident that if there is an MFN clause expressly including the dispute settlement procedures or expressly excluding them, there is no need for an interpretation.\n\n18.\n\nThere are indeed cases where the parties expressly state that the MFN clause applies to the dispute settlement mechanism. This has been done, for example, by the drafters of the UK Model BIT, who have provided in Article 3(3) that \"for avoidance of doubt MFN treatment shall apply to certain specified provisions of the BIT including the dispute settlement provision.\"\n\n19.\n\nThere exists also the opposite hypothesis where the parties expressly exclude the dispute settlement mechanism from the interplay of the MFN clause. A good example of this position is to be found in the Free Trade of the Americas (FTAA) draft of 21 November 2003, reacting to *Maffezini*, in which footnote 13 reads:\n\nThe Parties note the recent decision of the arbitral tribunal in the *Maffezini (Arg.) v. Kingdom of Spain*, which found an unusually broad most favored nation clause in an Argentina-Spain agreement to encompass international dispute resolution procedures.. By contrast, the Most-Favored-Nation Article of this Agreement is expressly limited in its scope to matters \"with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\" The Parties share the understanding and intent that this clause does not encompass international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n20.\n\nThe difficult question is raised when there is no express statement in the MFN clause relating to the dispute settlement mechanism. I will first give some indication on why I feel that the current analyses which exclude the possibility to use an MFN clause to change the dispute settlement mechanism, although they provide very valuable contextual elements and arrive at what I consider the sound solution, are not fully satisfactory in legal terms, before presenting a possible generally applicable reasoning for the application of MFN clauses to dispute settlement, subject of course to the necessary taking into account of the specific language of each clause.\n\n**Consideration of the analysis refusing to apply the MFN clause to dispute settlement procedures based on the argument of the specially negotiated clause**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn the operation of the most-favoured nation clause in relation to dispute settlement arrangements, the *Plama* tribunal, while strongly criticizing *Maffezini*, laid a great emphasis on the fact that such arrangements are \"specifically negotiated\"13 by the parties to the treaty:\n\nIt is also not evident that when parties have agreed in a particular BIT on a specific dispute resolution mechanism, as is the case with the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT (ad hoc arbitration), their agreement to most-favored-nation treatment means that they intended that, by operation of the MFN clause, their *specific agreement on such a dispute settlement mechanism* could be replaced by a totally different dispute resolution mechanism (ICSID arbitration). It is one thing to add to the treatment provided in one treaty more favorable treatment provided elsewhere. It is quite another thing to replace a procedure *specifically negotiated* by parties with an entirely different mechanism.14\n\nThe same idea was put forward in *Tecmed*, although not in relation with the effect of an MFN clause on dispute settlement mechanism, but in relation with the effect of an MFN clause on the application *ratione temporis* of the BIT. The tribunal considered that the MFN clause could not apply to a provision that goes \"to the core of matters that must be deemed to be specifically negotiated by the Contracting Parties.\", *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, SA v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No.ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, \u00a7 69.\n\n*Plama*, *op. cit.* note 8, \u00a7 209. Emphasis added.\n\n22.\n\nThis line of reasoning has been more or less reiterated in the case of *Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru*,15 where the tribunal insisted on the specificity of the provisions concerning the dispute settlement mechanism as compared to the generality of the language of the MFN clause.\n\n*Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 June 2009 (Spanish), \u00a7 216 and \u00a7 220.\n\n23.\n\nAlthough it is not to be doubted that States are very careful in accepting international arbitral mechanisms and certainly in negotiating their scope, I have difficulties being fully satisfied by the reasoning according to which dispute settlement clauses should be excluded only because they are \"specifically negotiated\". As aptly underscored in an article on MFN clauses, \"(t)hese statements, in a somewhat absurd manner, imply that dispute resolution provisions are more specifically negotiated than other treaty provisions. It is, however, presumed that, when entering into a treaty, the State parties intend to write what they write. There is no difference in nature, in terms of drafting, between the fair and equitable standard, the prohibition of expropriations without compensation, the prohibition of discriminatory or arbitrary conduct, or dispute resolution provisions.\"16\n\nYas Banifatemi, The Emerging Jurisprudence on the Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment in Investment Arbitration, in Andrea Bjorklund, Ian Laird & Sergey Ripinsky (eds)., Investment treaty law: current ISSUES III, London, BIICL, 2009, p. 269.\n\n24.\n\nI share this analysis and therefore cannot consider that the non applicability of the MFN clause to dispute settlement mechanisms can be solely justified by the argument that it has been specially negotiated - although this reasoning rightly insists on the importance of the dispute settlement mechanisms by which a State restricts its sovereignty in favor of foreign investors.\n\n**Consideration of the analysis refusing to apply the MFN clause to dispute settlement procedures on the basis of the distinction between substantive matters and procedural matters**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nAccording to this approach, the substantial rights would be the rights that grant a certain treatment either to the foreign investor or/and to the foreign investment17, while access to an international arbitration mechanism would be a different - procedural or jurisdictional - issue.\n\nDepending on the wording of the MFN clause.\n\n26.\n\nAn example of such an analysis distinguishing between substantial and procedural rights and stating that the MFN clause concerns only the substantive rights can be found in *Telenor Mobile* :\n\nIn the absence of language or context to suggest the contrary, the ordinary meaning of \u2018investments shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State' is that the investor's *substantive rights* in respect of the investments are to be treated no less favourably than under a BlT between the host State and a third State, and there is no warrant for construing the above phrase as importing *procedural rights* as well.18\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15, Award, 13 September 2006, \u00a7 92. Emphasis in the original.\n\n27.\n\nI think it cannot be contested that until the decision in *Maffezini*, \"the ordinary meaning to be given\" - to use the terms of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties - to the term \"treatment\" concerned the protection of substantial rights, and did not encompass any access to specific procedures of settlement of disputes concerning these rights, which are always an exception in international law.\n\n28.\n\nThere are many elements that can be adduced in support of this approach, which has been adopted by some ICSID tribunals and which has some strong advocates among the legal doctrine.19 The basic idea here is that substantive questions and procedural questions are of a different legal nature, which means that the *ejusdem generis* principle prevents the two to be equated and the MFN clause referring to treatment to be applied to dispute settlement mechanisms.\n\nOne of them, Zachary Douglas, has recently presented an impressive *plaidoyer* in favor of this distinction and has adduced several strong arguments to support it: the severability of the arbitration clause in private international law, which is based on the idea that this clause is of a different legal quality than the other obligations in the contract; the fact that the substantive obligations are addressed to the two States Parties to the BIT while the arbitration mechanism is addressed to the investor and the arbitral tribunal; the fact that any international tribunal can only be seized on the basis of the arbitration clause found in the basic treaty and that incorporating another arbitration clause through the MFN clause modifies the arbitration agreement on which the tribunal's jurisdiction rests after the commencement of the proceedings. *Op. cit*. note 6. It it also worth adding a mention of the EU 1990 Rome Convention (now Rome II) which distinguishes in international law, for the purpose of EU conflict rules, between civil law contracts and civil procedural law contracts such as (expressly) arbitration agreements, which is a supplementary indication of their different legal nature.\n\n29.\n\nI agree with this approach, but I am not convinced that, beyond this statement, a strong legal justification for such a dichotomy has so far been presented. In other words, although I think indeed that MFN clauses should not apply to dispute settlement mechanisms, I do not consider that this is completely satisfactorily explained by merely distinguishing substantive aspects and procedural/jurisdictional aspects without more. Or, to be more precise, I consider that, while this distinction should be retained as it has a strong explanatory potential, the reason at the root of this distinction has not so far been totally elucidated.\n\n30.\n\nIn search for such an explanation, one could consider here the famous Hart's distinction between primary rules (substantive rules) and secondary rules (rules dealing with the violation of the primary rules, including rules for the settlement of disputes on this issue).20 However, there is no strong authority for such an academic distinction, as has been stated, rightly in my view, in *Renta 4* :\n\nIt may be that some international lawyers reflexively adopt the dichotomy of primary/secondary obligations made familiar by the International Law Commission. This might explain the temptation to consider \"treatment\" a matter of primary or substantive rules and thus distinct from \"secondary\" rules - such as remedies - in the event of a breach.\n\n\u2026\n\nThere is no authority for the proposition that MFN is limited to \"primary\" rules. The established proper criterion is rather *ejusdem generis*.21\n\nHerbert HART, *The Concept of Law*, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1961, p. 77.\n\n*Renta 4 S.V.S.A et al. v. Russian Federation*, SCC No. 24/2007, Award on Preliminary Objections, 20 March 2009, \u00a7\u00a7 99-100.\n\n31.\n\nI am in agreement with this analysis. This being said, it must be admitted that rights and means of protecting rights are two different \"legal animals\". For example, while there is no possibility to make a reservation to the substantive obligations accepted by States in the Genocide Convention, it is possible to make a reservation to the jurisdiction of the ICJ provided for in Article IX of the Convention to decide on the responsibility of States for the violation of the substantive rules, which demonstrates a clear distinction between substantives rules and jurisdictional rules. Also, everybody is familiar with the severability of the arbitration clause in a contract, which also points to a different legal nature of the substantive obligations undertaken in a contract and the jurisdictional means to have these obligations enforced.22 Not to mention the fact that in numerous treatises on investment law, the chapter related to treatment does not include developments on the dispute settlement mechanisms, which are dealt with in a distinct chapter.\n\nThis comparison was hinted at in *Plama*, *op. cit*. note 8, \u00a7 212: \"This matter can also be viewed as forming part of the nowadays generally accepted principle of the separability (autonomy) of the arbitration clause. Dispute resolution provisions constitute an agreement on their own.\"\n\n32.\n\nAll this is certainly true, but I have to admit that it goes against a strong common perception that, in investment law, the availability of arbitration is probably the most important part of the \"treatment\" the foreign investor is looking for. In other words, it is difficult to contest that for investors and hence for the States of their nationality when they negotiate BITs, direct access to international arbitration for the settlement of investment disputes in lieu of the mechanism of diplomatic protection is a central feature of the international treatment afforded to-day by the BITs.\n\n33.\n\nThis has been recognized with slightly different justifications in several decisions: the access to arbitration was considered either as a jurisdictional protection \"inextricably related\" to substantive treatment,23 or even considered \"part of the treatment of foreign investors and investments\"24 or \"an integral part of the investment protection regime\"25, or even more, considered in itself \"a substantive protection.\"26\n\nIn *Maffezini*, the tribunal stated that \"there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute settlement arrangements are *inextricably related* to the protection of foreign investors\", *op. cit*. note 4, \u00a7 54. See also \u00a7 55: \"... dispute settlement arrangements... are also *closely linked* to the material aspects of the treatment accorded.\" Emphasis added.\n\nThe *Siemens* tribunal, in which Charles Brower, one of the members composing the majority of this Tribunal on the issue of the MFN clause, was sitting, stated that investment treaties have \"as a distinctive feature special dispute settlement mechanisms not normally open to investors. Access to these mechanisms is *part of the protection* offered under the Treaty. It is *part of the treatment* of foreign investors and investments.\", *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, \u00a7 102. Emphasis added.\n\n*Suez v. The Argentine Republic*, *op. cit*. note 2, \u00a7 57: \"From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the stated purposes of the Argentina-Spain BIT, dispute settlement is as important as other matters governed by the BIT and is *an integral part of the investment protection regime*.\" Emphasis added.\n\n*Gas Natural SDG, S.A. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision of the Tribunal on Preliminary Questions on Jurisdiction, June 17, 2005, \u00a7 31: \"The Tribunal holds that provision for international investor-state arbitration in bilateral investment treaties is *a significant substantive incentive and protection* for foreign investors.\" Emphasis added.\n\n34.\n\nThe decisions favoring extension of jurisdictional clauses by an MFN clause, based on an assimilation of substantive and procedural rights, have more often than not relied on *Ambatielos*. It is my contention that this is not a relevant reference,27 as it has to be stressed that there is an usually overlooked aspect of the often cited excerpt of *Ambatielos II* : it is the fact that the MFN clause was not used to change the conditions of access to a procedure, but was used to grant the nationals of Greece the substantive protection of an administration of justice \"in accordance with \u2018justice', \u2018right' and \u2018equity'\", as aptly underscored by the tribunals in *Salini v. Jordan*28 and in *Plama.*29 Thus, the assimilation made by *Maffezini* and its followers cannot rely on *Ambatielos*, which has been completely misinterpreted.\n\nThe same analysis is performed by Zachary Douglas when he states that \"(a)n error committed by the tribunal in *Maffezini*, and in several subsequent awards that have followed it, is the finding that the Commission of Arbitration's award in the *Ambatielos Case* supports the application of the MFN clause to the jurisdictional provisions of a third treaty\", *op. cit*. note 6, p. 6.\n\n*Salini*, *op. cit*. note 7, \u00a7 112\n\n*Plama*, *op. cit.* note 8, \u00a7 215.\n\n35.\n\nIf some of the premises used by international investment tribunals as a basis for their decision on the consequences of an MFN clause were to be accepted - *i.e*. the fact that dispute settlement is an integral part of treatment and the fact that any treatment not referred to in the basic treaty can be imported - then there is no logical bar to the importation of an ICSID clause into a treaty that does not provide at all for international arbitration. I am quite sure that few arbitrators, even the more favorable to the expansion of dispute settlement through the MFN clause, would welcome such a result.\n\n36.\n\nThis being said, although treatment and settlement of disputes cannot be strictly equated, I consider that it is not absurd to accept that international arbitration, on which it is well known that foreign investors rely heavily for their protection, is considered to-day by those foreign investors, *on a subjective plane*, as a significant and important aspect of the treatment their investments receive from a host State. In this sense, *i.e*. in the sense that would be given for example by an ordinary business person or a diplomat, I can subscribe to the Tribunal's remark in \u00a7 99 of the Award, where it is stated that \"(t)he Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the term \"treatment\" is in itself wide enough to be applicable also to procedural matters such as dispute settlement.\"\n\n37.\n\nThe question then is how can this subjective perception be reconciled with legal analysis? Can dispute settlement be considered as an integral part of the treatment granted to an investor, and can at the same time substantive treatment and settlement of disputes be considered as being of a different kind and therefore not capable of being assimilated by application of the *ejusdem generis* principle? I will try to answer this question, in showing that, in my view, there are indeed two different types of treatment *in legal terms*, two different types of treatment which do not imply the fulfillment of the same conditions for their coming into existence. In other words, I will attempt to show that the substantive treatment and the jurisdictional treatment are to be treated differently under the *ejusdem generis* principle, precisely because the qualifying conditions in order to benefit from each of this type of treatment are not the same. I came to this conclusion while trying to understand why substantial treatment and jurisdictional treatment should not be treated as being of the same nature.\n\n38.\n\nIn other words, I subscribe to the distinction substantive treatment/jurisdictional treatment, but for reasons on which I will try to elaborate later in this opinion.\n\n**Consideration of the analysis based on the distinction between an MFN clause referring to the protection of investments and one to the protection of investors.**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nMoreover, the distinction between substantive and procedural rights is not always self evident and has been conducive to subtle but strange ramifications, like in the case of *RosInvestCo.*30 In that case, the MFN clause included in the relevant paragraphs of Article 3 of the UK/USSR BIT provided:\n\nTreatment of Investments\n\n(1) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject *investments* or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of investors of any third State.\n\n(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject *investors* of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investors of any third State. (Emphasis added)\n\n*RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. Arb. V079/2005, Award on Jurisdiction, October 2007.\n\n40.\n\nFaced with these parallel statements, it can come as a surprise - at least to me -that the first paragraph has been considered as limited to substantive rights while the second one was deemed to encompass also procedural rights, although the access to international arbitration was not mentioned is the long list of the different aspects of the treatment of investors benefiting from the MFN clause.\n\n41.\n\nStarting with the analysis of paragraph (1) of Article 3, the tribunal asked the following question **: \"** Can the term *treatment* include the protection by an arbitration clause?\" (Emphasis in the original). The answer is in the negative as far as the treatment of investment is concerned: according to the tribunal, \"while the protection by an arbitration clause covering expropriation is a highly relevant aspect of that \u2018treatment'. it does not directly affect the \u2018investment'.\"31 The solution is the reverse as far as the treatment of investors is concerned, although it should be stressed again that in the enumeration of the aspects of the investor's situation that are expressly mentioned in the MFN clause, the dispute settlement mechanism is absent.32 In spite of this, the tribunal went on to consider that \"it is difficult to doubt that an expropriation interferes with the investor's use and enjoyment of the investment, and that the submission to arbitration forms a highly relevant part of the corresponding protection for the investor by granting him, in case of interference with his \u2018 *use'* and \u2018 *enjoyment'*, procedural options of obvious and great significance compared to the sole option of challenging such interference before the domestic courts of the host state.\"33 On that basis, the tribunal has indeed considered that it had jurisdiction beyond that granted by Article 8 of the UK/USSR BIT.\n\n*Id*., \u00a7 128.\n\nIt can be mentioned that such an enumeration was precisely considered by the Parties to the FTAA, as mentioned earlier, as not including the dispute settlement mechanism.\n\n*RosInvest*, *op. cit*. note 30, \u00a7 130.\n\n42.\n\nIf this decision is read literally, it means that when the MFN clause refers only to investments and not to investors, it should not apply to the dispute settlement mechanism as this is a jurisdictional right that can only be enjoyed by an investor and not by an investment. Applied to our case, in which the Argentina/Italy BIT grants MFN treatment to investments, this analysis would thus result in a refusal to incorporate any aspect of the dispute settlement provision of the Argentina/US BIT into the basic treaty and would render our Tribunal incompetent to hear the case.\n\n43.\n\nIt seems however to me that this is an artificial distinction, which would end up in different solutions for very similar MFN clauses, and on this specific point, I am more convinced by the conclusion adopted in *Siemens* to the effect that \"for purpose of applying the MFN clause, there is no special significance to the differential use of the term investors or investments in the Treaty,\" this resulting from the fact that \"treatment of the investment includes treatment of the investors\"34 as well as in *Plama*, where the same position was followed, the tribunal stating that it \"does not attach a particular significance to the use of the different terms,\"35 and in *Renta 4*, where the tribunal declared that \"(w)hether MFN treatment is stated in the relevant BIT to relate to investors rather than investments is in principle of no moment.\"36\n\n*Siemens, op. cit.* note 24, \u00a7 92.\n\n*Plama*, *op. cit.* note 8, \u00a7 190.\n\n*Renta 4, op. cit.* note 21, \u00a7 101.\n\n**The proposed analysis of the MFN clause based on a distinction between qualifying conditions for access to rights and rights, which justifies legally the distinction between substantial treatment and jurisdictional treatment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe main issue to be dealt with here concerns the interpretation of the Argentina/Italy BIT's MFN clause, which does not expressly refer to dispute settlement procedures. According to the Claimant, \"(o)n the basis of the MFN clause, Impregilo has invoked the dispute-resolution clause in the US-Argentina BIT, which does not foresee the procedure of waiting for 18 months for local courts to decide on the dispute before the investor may resort to international arbitration. The US-Argentina BIT only provides a six-month period of consultations to try amicably to resolve the dispute. The six-month period provided by the dispute-resolution clause in the US-Argentina BIT constitutes a more-favorable treatment, since it would allow Impregilo to bypass a formalistic, futile and excessively onerous step provided by the BIT.\"37 And the Claimant then relies on the broad wording of the clause, in order to have it apply to the dispute settlement procedure: \"With respect to the first paragraph, the \"all other matters regulated by the Agreement\" wording in the BIT's MFN clause is notably broad. The ordinary meaning of the terms \u2018all other matters regulated by this Agreement' is that *all* of the matters that are dealt with in the BIT are included, and there is no limitation in the text to this broad scope.\"38 The question thus is how to interpret this reference by the MFN clause to \"all matters\"?\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 25.\n\n*Id*., \u00a7 30. Emphasis in the original.\n\n45.\n\nIt is my submission that, even if access to arbitration can broadly speaking be considered part of the treatment, as already explained, the investor does not have access to the *two aspects of the overall treatment* to which it is entitled under a BIT under the same conditions, and that this is the ultimate justification for not assimilating the two. This is because of a profound difference between the national legal orders and the international legal order. On the national level, when there exists a substantive right, there is always automatically a means to protect such a right through the jurisdictional system. In other words, on the national level, jurisdictional treatment is inherent in substantive treatment. In contrast, on the international level, most rights cannot be enforced through a jurisdictional process, it is only when, exceptionally, the State has given its consent -consent to other States for accepting the jurisdiction of the ICJ or consent to foreign investors for accepting international arbitration - that such a \"jurisdictional treatment\" complements the substantive treatment granted by the international rules. Contrary to the situation existing in the national legal orders, the jurisdictional treatment is never inherent in the substantive treatment on the international level. In other words, there is a substantial treatment and there is a jurisdictional treatment which are quite distinct and must be distinguished, and the *ejusdem generis* principle requires that the two are not assimilated: it is not because *per se* one treatment is substantial and the other procedural that they should be treated differently, (some procedural requirements or procedural rights in the basic treaty might well be treated in the same manner as the substantive rules) it is because the jurisdictional treatment requires a supplementary condition in order to be granted to the investor, as will now be explained.\n\n***- The basic distinction***\n-----------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIt is well known that many tribunals have relied on a broad wording referring to \"all matters\" in order to decide that the MFN clause should be applied to dispute settlement procedures, although the same reasoning was also made in the face of less broad expressions. In contrast, other tribunals have expressed doubts as to the implications that can be drawn from this broad reference, like for example the tribunal in *Berschader*, when it stated that \"(w)ith respect to the construction of expressions such as \"all matters\" or \"all rights\" covered by a treaty, it should be noted that... not even seemingly clear language like this can be considered to have an unambiguous meaning in the context of an MFN clause.\"39\n\n*Berschader v. The Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. 080/2004, Award, 21 April 2006, \u00a7 184. It can be noted that this jurisdictional award, as well as the award on the merits, is being challenged before the courts in Sweden, as the place of arbitration.\n\n47.\n\nI share this comment and will show beneath that in many instances the MFN clause has indeed not been applied to all matters regulated by the treaty - and rightly so. This is because, in my view, there are two basically different types of provisions in BITs that need to be distinguished in this broad category of \"all matters\", as will now be discussed. There are **rights** and there are **fundamental conditions for access to the rights**. In other words, there are rules conferring substantive and jurisdictional rights to the foreign investors for their investments, and there are rules dealing with the access of the foreign investor to the substantive and jurisdictional rights granted by the basic treaty. I contend that **an MFN clause can only concern the rights that an investor can enjoy,** **it cannot modify the fundamental conditions for the enjoyment of such rights, in other words, the insuperable conditions of access to the rights granted in the BIT.**\n\n48.\n\nThis distinction has been clearly expressed, more than 50 years ago, by Ustor, who was the Special Rapporteur of the International Law Commission on the MFN clause40, who stated the following:\n\nThe beneficiary State can only claim rights which belong to the subject-matter of the clause, which are within the time-limits and **other conditions and restrictions set by the agreement**, and which are in respect of persons or things specified in the clause or implied from its subject-matter.\n\nEndre Ustor, Special Rapporteur of the ILC, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1969, Vol. II, p. 170, Document A/CN.4/ 213, April 18, 1969, Second Report on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1970, Vol. II, p. 204, March 9 and May 18, 1970, Document A.CN.4/228 and Add. 1. Emphasis added. See also for the same formulation, the word MostFavoured-Nation Clause, Endre Ustor, in ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW, North-Holland and al, Max Plank Institute, vol. 8, p. 415. This citation has been quoted with approval by the decision in *Telefonica S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/20, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 May 2006, decided by a tribunal of which Charles Brower was a member, in \u00a7 99, although the decision did not draw, in my view, the necessary conclusions from it.\n\n49.\n\nThis statement should not be overlooked and is in fact of crucial importance, being capable of fully explaining the way an MFN clause has to be implemented.\n\n50.\n\nAs an MFN clause cannot change the conditions of access to the rights, this has far reaching consequences on a necessary differential approach to the substantive rights and the jurisdictional rights, whose qualifying conditions are distinct, although partly overlapping.\n\n51.\n\nIn order to benefit from the substantial rights granted in a BIT, certain conditions being \"matters regulated by the BIT\" have to be fulfilled: these are the well known conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae*, *ratione temporis*.\n\n52.\n\nIn order to benefit from the jurisdictional protection granted by an arbitration mechanism, these same conditions have to be fulfilled, but in addition there is a condition *ratione voluntatis* : the State must have given its consent to such a procedure which allows a foreign investor to sue the State directly on the international level. This consent is expressed broadly or restrictively, with conditions of exhaustion of local remedies or waiting periods, as allowing all claims or only certain claims: in other words, the consent is given under certain conditions. Just as the conditions of nationality for example must be fulfilled before an investor can have access to all the rights granted by the BIT, the conditions shaping the State's consent to arbitration must be fulfilled before a right to arbitration can arise.\n\n53.\n\nIt has to be clarified here that the consent to arbitration is a different consent than the one given by the State to another State when it ratifies the treaty, and that the necessity of this supplementary consent is explained by the structure of international law. It is indeed not because a State has given its *consent to another State* to grant some substantive rights to the investors of that State that it automatically flows from such a consent that the State also gives its *consent to the foreign investors* to allow the latter to sue the State directly in an international arbitration. For such a right to come into existence, a specific consent has to be given inside the treaty, and the State can shape this consent as it sees fit, in providing for the basic conditions under which such a consent is given, in other words, the conditions under which such an \"offer to arbitrate\" is made to the foreign investors. It is of utmost importance not to forget that *no participant* in the international community, be it a State, an international organization, a physical or a legal person, has an inherent right of access to a jurisdictional recourse. Just as a State cannot sue another State, unless there is a specific consent to that effect, for example through a declaration recognizing as compulsory the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, in the same manner, in the framework of BITs, investors are not capable of intervening on the international level against States for the recognition of their rights, unless States grant them such a right under conditions that they determine. An arbitral tribunal - just as the ICJ or any international court - does not have a general jurisdiction, it only has a \"*comp\u00e9tence d'attribution*\", which has to respect the limits provided for by the States.\n\n54.\n\nThis can be illustrated by different judgments of the ICJ41. In particular, it is interesting to mention the case brought by the RDC against Rwanda and decided a few years ago. In that case, Rwanda has been arguing the following:\n\nWith respect to its reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, Rwanda first observes that, although, as the DRC contends, the norms codified in the substantive provisions of the Genocide Convention have the status of *jus cogens* and create rights and obligations *erga omnes*, that does not in itself suffice to \u2018confer jurisdiction on the Court with respect to a dispute concerning the application of those rights and obligations'...\n\nSecondly, Rwanda argues that its reservation to Article IX is not incompatible with the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention, inasmuch as the reservation relates not \u2018to the substantive obligations of the parties to the Convention but to a procedural provision'.42\n\n*Case Concerning East Timor* (Portugal v. Australia), *ICJ Reports* 1995, Judgment of 30 June 1995, \u00a7 29. In this case, the ICJ clearly stated that even a substantive norm having the character of *jus cogens* does not imply that there exists a right to have this norm enforced in an international jurisdiction: \". the Court considers that the *erga omnes* character of a norm and the rule of consent are two different things.\" See also *Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo* (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, *ICJ Reports* 2006, Judgment of 3 February 2006.\n\n*Op cit*. note 41, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61.\n\n55.\n\nThe Court followed the argumentation of Rwanda, in distinguishing without ambiguity even the most compelling substantive rules on the one hand and access to the Court on the other hand:\n\nThe Court observes, however, as it has already had occasion to emphasize, that \"the *erga omnes* character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things\" (*East Timor (Portugal* v. *Australia), Judgment, I.C.J.* *Reports 1995*, p. 102, para. 29), and that the mere fact that rights and obligations *erga omnes* may be at issue in a dispute would not give the Court jurisdiction to entertain that dispute. The same applies to the relationship between peremptory norms of general international law *(jus cogens)* and the establishment of the Court's jurisdiction: the fact that a dispute relates to compliance with a norm having such a character, which is assuredly the case with regard to the prohibition of genocide, cannot of itself provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain that dispute. Under the Court's Statute that jurisdiction is always based on the consent of the parties.43\n\n*Id*, \u00a7 64. This was commented upon by Zachary Douglas in his article, *op. cit*. note 6, p. 7: \"In other words, the status of the substantive obligation to desist from acts of genocide in the Genocide Convention has no impact upon the jurisdictional mandate of the Court in resolving disputes arising out of the Convention. Each treaty provision addresses different things. They are not *ejusdem generis*.\"\n\n56.\n\nIt does appear that on the international level no automatic assimilation can be made between substantive rights and jurisdictional means to enforce them, the qualifying conditions for access to the substantive rights and the qualifying conditions for access to the jurisdictional means being different. This distinction between the qualifying conditions and the rights, in fact, explains the solutions that have been adopted in different cases involving MFN clauses, whether dealing with substantive or jurisdictional matters.\n\n***- The general explanatory potential of the distinction***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nI will now show that there are many cases in which the conditions for access to a substantive right, although included in all the matters regulated by the BIT, have not been considered as being capable to be expanded by an MFN clause. In fact, I suggest that the mainly non-controversial decisions applying MFN clauses to substantive rights can indeed be explained by such an analytical framework, based on a distinction between the access to the right and the right itself. In other words, it is my submission that a reference in an MFN clause to all matters never means that it is indeed applicable to all matters, as the conditions of access to the rights granted by the BIT are not included in that expression.\n\n58.\n\nIt is not contested that all **the substantive rights** granted under an investment protection treaty can only be granted if the conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae*, and *ratione temporis* provided for in the treaty are satisfied. These conditions are clearly matters regulated by the treaty, but it has never been suggested that they could be modified by the MFN clause.\n\n59.\n\nThis has been acknowledged by Yas Banifatemi, in an article on MFN clauses:44\n\nIndeed, each treaty sets forth its own conditions and scope of application *ratione* *personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis.*... the requirements of an investment' made by an 'investor' within the meaning of the relevant investment treaty are **qualifying conditions** which, if not met, constitute **an obstacle to the applicability of the treaty**.\n\n*Op. cit*. note 16, p. 250. Emphasis added.\n\n60.\n\nThis excerpt is interesting as it points to the distinction between the rights granted to the investors and the qualifying conditions to be met for being able to benefit from these rights. However, in my view, the mentioned conditions are not conditions that have to be met before the treaty can apply at all, as stated in this article. To be more accurate, it should be said that the conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis* are conditions that precisely result from the applicability of the treaty. They are conditions regulated by the BIT, which sets forth the pre-requisites for *the enjoyment of the rights under the treaty*, the conditions for the application of the treaty depending on the rules of general international law concerning the consent of the States. If for example, a condition *ratione materiae* regulated by the treaty is not fulfilled, the treaty indeed applies - were it only for the interpretation of the meaning of the condition *ratione materiae* stated in the treaty at stake - with the result that the concerned investor cannot benefit from the rights granted by the treaty. In other words, an MFN clause cannot be used to bypass the requirements for having access to the substantive rights granted by the treaty.\n\n61.\n\nThe same is true for **the procedural/jurisdictional rights** concerning access to ICSID jurisdiction, which are also granted only to the investor when the same conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae*, and *ratione temporis* plus a condition *ratione* *voluntatis* is fulfilled. If the conditions posed by the State for giving its consent to international arbitration in the basic treaty are not fulfilled, the investor cannot benefit from the jurisdictional right granted by the treaty.\n\n62.\n\nThese qualifying conditions are reflected in the Argentina/Italy BIT, which requires:\n\n- first, a condition *ratione personae* : the dispute must oppose a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State (this is stated in Article 8 (1) and Article 1);\n\n- second, a condition *ratione materiae* : there must exist a dispute regarding an investment (this is stated in Article 8 (1) and Article 1);\n\n- third, a condition *ratione voluntatis*, *i.e*. the Contracting State must present an \"offer to arbitrate\", which can then be accepted at will by a foreign investor (this offer is found in Article 8 (3))\n\n- fourth, a condition *ratione temporis* : the BIT must have been applicable at the relevant time (this is stated in Article 11 and Article 12).\n\n63.\n\nAll these conditions are conditions provided for by the BIT, entering as such in \"all the matters\" regulated by the BIT. As will be developed beneath, it has never been admitted that the conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae*, and *ratione temporis* could be modified by reliance on an MFN clause. It is my contention that it would not be logical to admit that these conditions could not be modified by the MFN clause - which is not contested - while the condition *ratione voluntatis*, for an unknown reason, could be so modified by the MFN clause.\n\n***- The explanatory potential of the distinction as far as substantive rights are concerned***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*- The definition of \"investor\" is certainly included in \"all matters\" regulated by the BIT, but cannot be modified by the use of an MFN clause, as this definition conditions the access to BIT protection.*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIt is not contested that an MFN clause cannot change the condition *ratione personae,* which is a condition for the enjoyment of all treaty rights, whether substantive or jurisdictional. For example, if the basic treaty applies to national companies only if there is a 70% foreign control, an MFN clause cannot be used to introduce a provision according to which a national company can be protected as soon as there is a 20% foreign ownership, if such a clause exists in another treaty. In the same manner, if the basic treaty excludes international arbitration for dual nationals, an MFN clause could not be used to include dual nationals. More generally, it can be said that an MFN clause cannot enlarge the scope of the basic treaty to grant the rights of the treaty to investors that are not protected under the basic treaty.\n\n65.\n\nIn the Argentina/Italy BIT, the term \"investor is defined in Article 1 (2) in the following manner:\n\n\"Investor\" means any individual or legal entity of a Contracting Party who has made, makes, or has undertaken to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n\u2014 \"individual\" means, in respect of each one of the Contracting Parties, an individual who is a citizen of that State in accordance with its laws.\n\n\u2014 \"legal entity\" means, in respect of each one of the Contracting Parties, any entity established and recognized under the laws of a Contracting Party, having its seat in the territory of that Party, such as a public entity engaged in economic activities, partnerships or corporations, foundations and associations, whether with limited or unlimited liability.\n\n66.\n\nIn conclusion, an MFN clause could not be utilized, for example, to change that definition - although it is clearly a matter regulated by the treaty - and grant the rights under the treaty to companies that are established under the law of the State but do not have their seat in its territory.\n\n*- The definition of \"investment\" is certainly included in \"all matters\" regulated by the BIT, but cannot be modified by the use of an MFN clause, as this definition conditions the access to BIT protection* ***.***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAlso, it is not contested that an MFN clause cannot change the condition *ratione materiae,* which is a condition for the enjoyment of all treaty rights, whether substantive or jurisdictional. For example, if the basic treaty applies only to investment in agriculture, an MFN clause cannot be used to introduce a provision according to which the treaty should also apply to investments in industry.45\n\nThis was stated for example in the Commentary on Article 9 of the Draft Articles on Most-FavouredNation Clauses with commentaries, 1978 *, ILC Report* Vol. II, Part 2, A/CN/4/SER.A/1978/Add.1 (Part 2), p. 30: \"The essence of the rule is that the beneficiary of a most-favoured-nation clause cannot claim from the granting State advantages of a kind other than that stipulated in the clause. For instance, if the most-favoured nation clause promises most-favoured-nation treatment solely for fish, such treatment cannot be claimed under the same clause for meat.\"\n\n68.\n\nThis has been stated in an UNCITRAL case,46*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic*, in the following terms:\n\n\"The Claimant has also made the argument that the most-favored-nation (\"MFN\") clause contained in Article 4 of the Treaty entitles it to treatment not less favourable than that accorded to investors of other nations that have entered into treaties with the Dominican Republic. The Claimant believes in particular that the definition of investment included in the General American Free Trade Agreement-Dominican Republic with the United States, which includes among other features the \"expectation of gain or profit\", extends to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale as the beneficiary of the clause under the Treaty here concerned. The Tribunal does not believe this to be the case.\n\nEach Treaty defines what it considers a protected investment and who is entitled to that protection, and definitions can change from treaty to treaty. In this situation, resort to the specific text of the MFN Clause is unnecessary because it applies only to the treatment accorded to such defined investment, but not to the definition of \"investment\" itself.\"47\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic*, UNCITRAL, LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008.\n\n*Id*., \u00a7\u00a7 40-41\n\n69.\n\nIn sum, an MFN clause cannot be utilized in order to enlarge the scope of the basic treaty concerning the investments that can benefit from the rights granted by the treaty.\n\n*- The definition of the temporal application of the BIT is certainly included in \"all matters\" regulated by the BIT, but cannot be modified by the use of an MFN clause, as* *this definition conditions the access to the BIT protection.*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nIt is also more than evident that an MFN clause cannot change the condition *ratione temporis,* which is a condition for the enjoyment of all treaty rights, whether substantial or jurisdictional. If the basic treaty applies only to investments made after its entry into force, an MFN clause cannot be used to introduce a provision according to which investments made before the entry into force of the BIT should also be protected. This has been noted in an already quoted article on MFN clauses, where it is stated that \"(a)nother situation where no difficulty arises in the application of the most-favoured nation clause is where the investor seeks to use the provision in order to bypass the requirements for the treaty's application *ratione temporis*.\"48 And precisely, there is no difficulty here, as the application in time is a condition of existence of the rights under the treaty.\n\nYas Banifatemi, *op. cit*. note 16, p. 248.\n\n71.\n\nThe necessity not to modify the condition *ratione temporis* for the existence of the treaty rights has been acknowledged for example in *Tecmed v. Mexico* : in that case, the Mexico-Spain BIT precisely provided that it was only applicable to investments made after its entry into force, and the tribunal refused to utilize the MFN clause relied on by the claimant in order to introduce a provision of the Mexico-Austria BIT according to which investments made before the entry into force of the BIT are also be protected:\n\n... matters relating to the application over time of the Agreement, which involve more the time dimension of application of its substantive provisions rather than matters of procedure or jurisdiction, due to their significance and importance, go to the core of matters that must be deemed to be specifically negotiated by the Contracting Parties. These are determining factors for their acceptance of the Agreement, as they are directly linked to the identification of the substantive protection regime applicable to the foreign investor and, particularly, to the general (national or international) legal context within which such regime operates, as well as to *the access of foreign investor to the substantive provisions* of such regime. Their application cannot therefore be impaired by the principle contained in the most favored nation clause.49 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Tecmed, op. cit.* note 13, \u00a7 69. Emphasis added.\n\n72.\n\nThe solution adopted is entirely coherent with the analysis presented here. I have however developed earlier why I do not think that the argument advanced by the tribunal - the argument that the MFN clause does apply to \"the core of matters that must be deemed to be specifically negotiated by the Contracting Parties\" - is a sufficiently explanatory analysis.50\n\nThe same analysis applicable to the *ratione temporis* condition relating to investments applies of course to the *ratione temporis* condition relating to the coming into force of the treaty itself, although this is not a matter regulated by the treaty, but by general principles of international law. In *MCI v. Ecuador*, the tribunal refused to utilize the MFN clause to set aside the date of the entry into force of the Ecuador-US investment treaty in May 1997, and to import the earlier date of entry into force of the Ecuador-Argentina BIT which was the date of December 1, 1995, *MCI Power Group LC and New Turbine, Inc v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award of 31 July 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 127-128.\n\n73.\n\nIn the Argentina/Italy BIT, the *ratione temporis* scope of the existence of the rights granted by the treaty are defined in Article 11 and 12:\n\nARTICLE 11\n\nInvestments made before the Effective Date of this Agreement\n\nThis Agreement shall also apply to investments made before the effective date of this Agreement by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Party and recorded by the latter as a foreign investment in accordance with its statutory provisions.  \n In any case, it shall not apply to disputes pending or settled before it came into force or to any claims pending or arising before such date.\n\nARTICLE 12\n\nEffective Date\n\nThis Agreement shall enter into force on the date on which the Contracting Parties shall have notified each other that their respective constitutional requirements for the execution of this Agreement have been fulfilled.\n\n74.\n\nThese articles delimit the temporal scope of existence of the treaty's rights, and as they embody the qualifying conditions for having access to such rights, they cannot be modified by an MFN clause. For example, the treaty could not apply to a pending dispute, if such a possibility would exist in another BIT entered into by Argentina.\n\n75.\n\nIn conclusion, an MFN clause cannot be utilized in order to enlarge the scope of the basic treaty concerning the existence *ratione temporis* of the rights granted by the treaty.\n\n76.\n\nThe fact that the expression \"all matters\" does not cover really \"all\" matters, and clearly not the qualifying conditions of access to the substantive rights granted to the foreign investors, has been also acknowledged by the tribunal in *Berschader*, where it stated that \"the expression \u2018all matters covered by the present Treaty' certainly cannot be understood literally.\"51\n\n*Berschader*, *op. cit*. note 39, \u00a7 192. See also \u00a7 184.\n\n77.\n\nAs just presented, it is generally accepted that these conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis*, which undoubtedly are included in \"all matters regulated\" by the BIT and are conditioning the treatment to be granted to foreign investments under the basic treaty, cannot be modified by the use of an MFN clause. As stated in *Tecmed*, matters relating to \"the access of foreign investor to the substantive provisions... cannot... be impaired by the principle contained in the most favored nation clause.\"52 I consider this approach eminently correct. The same holds true, in my view, for the conditions for the access of foreign investors to the jurisdictional provisions, which cannot either be by-passed by an MFN clause.\n\n*Tecmed*, *op. cit*. note 13, \u00a7 69.\n\n***- The explanatory potential of the distinction as far as jurisdictional rights are concerned***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*- The conditions shaping the State consent to arbitration are certainly included in \"all matters\" regulated by the BIT, but cannot be modified by the use of an MFN clause, as they condition the access to the BIT arbitration mechanism*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nJust as an MFN clause cannot change the conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae*, and *ratione temporis*, as has just been demonstrated, it must be equally true that an MFN clause cannot change the condition *ratione voluntatis,* which is a qualifying condition for the enjoyment of the jurisdictional rights open for the protection of substantial rights.\n\n79.\n\nIn other words, before a provision relating to the dispute settlement mechanism can be imported into the basic treaty, the right to international arbitration - here ICSID arbitration - has to be capable of coming into existence for the foreign investor under the basic treaty, in other words the existence of this right is conditioned on the fulfillment of all the necessary conditions for such jurisdiction, the conditions *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae*, and *ratione temporis* as well as a supplementary condition relating to the scope of the State's consent to such jurisdiction, the condition *ratione voluntatis*.\n\n80.\n\nAs long as the qualifying conditions expressed by the State in order to give its consent are not fulfilled, there is no consent, in other words no access of the foreign investor to the jurisdictional treatment granted by ICSID arbitration. An MFN clause cannot enlarge the scope of the basic treaty's right to international arbitration, it cannot be used to grant access to international arbitration when this is not possible under the conditions provided for in the basic treaty.\n\n81.\n\nIf the qualifying conditions of access to a right could be modified this would completely change the scope of the BIT. As explained in the Draft Articles on MostFavoured-Nation Clauses of 1978:\n\nThe effect of the most-favoured-nation process is, by means of the provisions of one treaty, to attract those of another. Unless this process is strictly confined to cases where there is a substantial identity between the subject matter of the two sets of clauses concerned, the result in a number of cases may be to impose upon the granting State obligations it never contemplated. Thus the rule follows clearly from the general principles of treaty interpretation. States cannot be regarded as being bound beyond the obligations they have undertaken.53\n\nDraft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses with commentaries, 1978 *, ILC Report* Vol. II, Part 2, A/CN/4/SER.A/1978/Add.1 (Part 2), p. 30.\n\n- *Are all conditions shaping the State's consent to be treated in the same manner or is there a distinction to be made between conditions of admissibility and conditions of jurisdiction?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nA delicate question needs however to be raised here, *i.e.* whether a distinction should be made between the different conditions shaping the State's consent to international arbitration. This raises the issue of a possible distinction between conditions of admissibility and conditions of jurisdiction.\n\n83.\n\nThere appears to be no legal reason to treat differently these two types of requirements that condition the State's consent.54 On this issue, I am in agreement with my co-arbitrator Charles Brower, who explained in his Separate opinion in *Renta 4*, that \". there is no reason to differentiate between admissibility-related aspects of accessing investor-State arbitration and matters of jurisdiction.\"55\n\nThis has been confirmed less than a month ago by the ICJ in the case concerning *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination* (Georgia *v.* Russian Federation), Judgment of 1 April 2011. The Court had to interpret Article 22 of the the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (\"CERD\") of 21 December 1965, which reads : \"Any dispute between two or more States Parties with respect to the interpretation or application of this Convention, which is not settled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this Convention, shall, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision, unless the disputants agree to another mode of settlement.\" The Court considered that the terms of Article 22 \"establish preconditions before the seisin of the Court.\" \u00a7 141.\n\nSeparate opinion in *Renta 4*, *op. cit*. note 21, \u00a7 10.\n\n84.\n\nThis position has already been adopted by several ICSID tribunals, in the general context of the exercise of their *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence*.56 For example in *Enron*, the tribunal declared:\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to note in this matter, however, that the conclusion reached is not because the six-month negotiation period could be a procedural and not a jurisdictional requirement as has been argued by the Claimants and affirmed by other tribunals. Such requirement is in the view of the Tribunal *very much a jurisdictional one*. A failure to comply with that requirement would result in a determination of lack of jurisdiction.57\n\nAs well as by legal doctrine. See for example, Andrew Newcombe *&* Lluis Paradell, LAW AND PRACTICE OF INVESTMENT TREATIES, The Hague, Kluwer, 2009, pp. 220-221: \"IIA tribunals have consistently applied MFN clauses to allow investors to avoid requirements that disputes be submitted to local courts before resorting to arbitration. On the other hand, to date, all tribunals except one have rejected the use of an MFN clause in a basic treaty to confer greater subject matter jurisdiction provided for in a third-party treaty.\"... It might be suggested that the conflicting approaches of tribunals to the application of MFN clauses can be explained by the distinction between questions of admissibility and jurisdiction... Although this argument is appealing on its surface, there would not appear to be a principled basis upon which to decide that an MFN clause applies to issues of admissibility but not jurisdiction. Further, from a practical standpoint, the distinction between admissibility and jurisdiction is very difficult to apply. Indeed, the *Maffezini* tribunal stated that failure to comply with the local remedies requirement, if applicable, would mean that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction.\", p. 216.\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004, \u00a7 88. Emphasis added.\n\n85.\n\nIn the same manner, the tribunal in *Burlington* was very clear in its analysis of a 6 months negotiation requirement, which was considered as a jurisdictional requirement:\n\n... by imposing upon investors an obligation to voice their disagreement at least six months prior to the submission of an investment dispute to arbitration, the Treaty effectively accords host States the right to be informed about the dispute at least six months before it is submitted to arbitration. The purpose of this right is to grant the host State an *opportunity* to redress the problem before the investor submits the dispute to arbitration. In this case, Claimant has deprived the host State of that opportunity. That suffices to defeat jurisdiction.58\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, \u00a7 315. Emphasis in the original. See also, *Murphy v. Ecuador*, where the tribunal considered that the waiting period was a jurisdictional requirement, and that the non respect of such waiting period had as its consequence the lack of jurisdiction of the tribunal, *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International c. Ecuador,* ICSID case No. ARB/08/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 15 December 2010, \u00a7\u00a7 140-157.\n\n86.\n\nThe same approach has been followed in cases implying the consequences of an MFN clause, like for example in *Telef\u00f3nica* :\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that this requirement, or precondition, is best qualified as a temporary bar to the initiation of arbitration. The objection is therefore technically an exception of inadmissibility raised by Argentina against the Claimant for not having complied with the requirement. The Tribunal notes that the inadmissibility of the claim would result in the Tribunal's temporary *lack of jurisdiction...*59\n\n*Telef\u00f3nica, op. cit.* note 40, \u00a7 93. Emphasis added. Footnote omitted.\n\n87.\n\nAnd the same analysis again was performed in *Wintershall* :\n\nAnd the eighteen-month requirement of a proceeding before local courts (stipulated in Article 10(2)) is an essential preliminary step to the institution of ICSID Arbitration, under the Argentina-Germany BIT; it constitutes an integral part of the \"standing offer\" (\"consent\") of the Host State, which must be accepted on the same terms by every individual investor who seeks recourse (ultimately) to ICSID arbitration for resolving its dispute with the Host State under the concerned BIT.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe requirement of recourse to local courts for an eighteen-month period in Article 10(2) is *fundamentally a jurisdictional clause*, not a mere procedural provision.60\n\n*Wintershall, op. cit.* note 9, \u00a7 160 and \u00a7 172. Emphasis added.\n\n88.\n\nIf therefore all conditions shaping the State's consent are considered jurisdictional prerequisites to the existence of a right to international arbitration, it follows that an MFN clause will never be able to change the parameters of such consent to a mechanism of international arbitration. All the conditions - whether a waiting period or a condition of exhaustion of local remedies, whether a restriction of consent to a certain type of arbitration, whether a restriction on the scope of the arbitration - are jurisdictional conditions to the State's consent to arbitration, that cannot be displaced by an MFN clause.\n\n*- The fact that the MFN clause does not allow to change the conditions for the State's consent given in the basic treaty is in coherence with the importance of the consent of the State in international arbitration*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe conclusion reached is reinforced by some more general considerations relating to the States' consent to international arbitration. The inapplicability of MFN clauses to dispute settlement mechanisms is the more so warranted that \"consent is the cornerstone of ICSID arbitration.\" Indeed, the analysis based on a distinction between the granted rights and the qualifying conditions for access to these rights, which leads to the unavoidable conclusion that the MFN clause cannot modify the conditions put by a State for granting to foreign investors access to ICSID arbitration, is considerably reinforced, as far as the condition *ratione voluntatis* is concerned, by the importance of the State's consent to international arbitration.\n\n90.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that if an MFN clause is used to import a dispute settlement procedure from a third party treaty into the basic treaty, it appears as a means of establishing jurisdiction for an arbitral tribunal where jurisdiction could not otherwise be established under the basic treaty.\n\n91.\n\nThis importance of the State's consent has been underscored in numerous decisions of international jurisdictions, among which the PCIJ and the ICJ.61 It is worth quoting what the ICJ has to say on the fundamental principle of consent in the *Armed Activities* case:\n\n[The Court's] jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent accepted by them... When that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, *any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon*.\"62\n\n*Status of Eastern Carelia* case, (1923), PCIJ, Series B, No. 5, p. 27; *Ambatielos Case* (Greece v. United Kingdom), Merits: Obligation to Arbitrate, Judgment of May 19, 1953, *ICJ Reports*, 1953; *Ambatielos I\"*, Dissenting Opinion by Sir Arnold McNair, President, and Judges Basdevant, Klaestad and Read, *ICJ Reports,* 1953, p. 33, where reference is made to the *Phosphates in Morocco* case (Italy v. France). Emphasis added. In the *Phosphates in Morocco* (Italy v. France), 1938, the PCIJ observed that it was advisable in case of doubt, to give a restrictive interpretation of a clause in a treaty because such a clause \"must on no account be interpreted in such a way as to exceed the intention of the States that subscribed to it\", *PCIJ Reports*, Ser. A/B No. 74, 1938, p. 14. See also, *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (* Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda *), Jurisdiction and Admissibility,* Judgment of 3 February 2006 *, I.C.J. Reports* 2006.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00a7 88. Emphasis added.\n\n92.\n\nThe same can be said concerning the conditions to which a unilateral offer in an international agreement is subject, which are consubstantial with that consent and cannot be distinguished from it.\n\n93.\n\nThe importance of consent has always been stressed in international arbitration cases and especially in ICSID cases. *Plama*, of course, has laid a great emphasis on the necessity of a clear an unambiguous consent:\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the following consideration is equally, if not more, important.... Nowadays, arbitration is the generally accepted avenue for resolving disputes between investors and states. Yet, that phenomenon does not take away *the basic prerequisite for arbitration: an agreement of the parties to arbitrate.* It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that *such an agreement should be clear and unambiguous*. In the framework of a BIT, the agreement to arbitrate is arrived at by the consent to arbitration that a state gives in advance in respect of investment disputes falling under the BIT, and the acceptance thereof by an investor if the latter so desires.  \n Doubts as to the parties' clear and unambiguous intention can arise if the agreement to arbitrate is to be reached by incorporation by reference.63\n\n*Plama, op. cit.* note 8, \u00a7\u00a7 198-199. Emphasis added.\n\n94.\n\n*Plama* has been criticized for having allegedly adopted a restrictive interpretation of the State's consent, because it stated that such consent should be \"clear and unambiguous\", and that an MFN clause can only apply to dispute settlement mechanism if this provision \"leaves no doubt\" that the parties to the BIT so intended. It might well be that the formula was somewhat overstated and that it could give rise to such criticism, as was done for example by the tribunal in *Berschader* :\n\nThe *Plama* tribunal states that an arbitration clause in a BIT is an agreement to arbitrate, and such agreements should be clear and unambiguous. If this means that generally speaking, arbitration agreements should be construed in a manner which is different in principle from that applied to the construction of other agreements, this tribunal finds it doubtful whether such principle can be said to exist.64\n\n*Berschader, op. cit.* note 39, \u00a7 177.\n\n95.\n\nHowever, it is one thing to use a restrictive interpretation to find a consent, which is certainly not warranted and which, in my view, the *Plama* tribunal does not seem to have done65, and a different thing to consider that any given consent to arbitration must be clear and certain, which cannot be contested.66 Who would argue that an uncertain and ambiguous consent to arbitration is sufficient to confer jurisdiction to an arbitral tribunal?\n\nSee the case of *Amco*, where the Tribunal noted that: \"In the first place, like any other conventions, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties [\u2026] Moreover - and this is again a general principle of law - any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of their commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\", *Amco Asia et al.* v. *Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, \u00a7 14.\n\nThis is very generally accepted. See for example the ICC award in the *SPP* case, which recognized this requirement: \"We accept the principle that acceptance of an arbitration clause should be clear and unequivocal.\" ICC Award No. 3493, 16 February 1983, *Yearbook Com. Arb.* 1984, vol. IX, p. 115. The award was annulled by the French courts, precisely because, on the facts of the case, the consent of Egypt was not clear and unequivocal.\n\n96.\n\nThe decision in *Wintershall* has insisted again on the idea that the State must have given its consent and that this consent is a condition for the access to international arbitration:\n\nIn the present case, therefore the BIT between Argentine/and Germany is a treaty undoubtedly providing for a right of access to international arbitration (ICSID) for foreign investors, who are German nationals -but this right of access to ICSID arbitration is not provided for unreservedly, but upon condition of first approaching competent Courts in Argentina... a local-remedies rule may be lawfully provided for in the BIT - under the first part of Article 26; once so provided, as in Article 10(2), *it becomes a condition of Argentina's \"consent\" - which* *is, in effect, Argentina's \"offer\" to arbitrate disputes under the BIT, but* *only upon acceptance and compliance by an investor of the provisions inter alia of Article 10(2)* ; an investor (like the Claimant) can accept the \"offer\" only as so conditioned.67\n\n*Wintershall*, *op. cit.* note 9, \u00a7 116.\n\n97.\n\nIn our case, it seems evident to me that there is NO UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ARBITRATE given by Argentina to the Italian investors - and reciprocally by Italy to the Argentine investors - in the Argentina/Italy BIT, there is only an offer to arbitrate under a condition, *i.e*. to have first tried to have the case settled in the local courts for 18 months.\n\n98.\n\nIf the offer to arbitrate under certain conditions, which is already made to a broad category of investors which are not known in advance by the State, could also be modified as far as the conditions shaping such consent are concerned, the \"cornerstone of ICSID arbitration\" would look as a completely inchoate consent. A consent that is given by a State to a defined but undetermined category of investors, which would moreover also be undefined as far as the conditions under which it is given or its scope are concerned, and would depend on the vagaries of possible other treaties entered into by the State, would not be a clear consent at all, it would be a versatile consent, it could even be said that it would not be a consent at all.\n\n99.\n\nUnless specifically stated to the contrary, the qualifying conditions put by the State in order to accept to be sued directly on the international level by foreign investors cannot be displaced by an MFN clause, and a conditional right to ICSID cannot magically be transformed into an unconditional right by the grace of the MFN clause. The access to the right as provided in the basic treaty cannot be modified through an MFN clause. Any other solution comports in my view great dangers.\n\n**The dangers of the** ***Maffezini*** **approach which, for some, were recognized in the decision itself**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nIt has to be reminded that in *Maffezini*, the tribunal was conscious of the far reaching consequences of its decision to use the MFN clause to modify the dispute settlement procedures and felt compelled to state that \"a distinction has to be made between the legitimate extension of rights and benefits by means of operation of the clause, on the one hand, and disruptive treaty-shopping that would play havoc with the policy objectives of underlying specific treaty provisions, on the other hand.\"68 Therefore, the tribunal in trying to keep things under control, added that \"there are some important limits that ought to be kept in mind.\"69 These limits have been summarized in the following manner:\n\nAs a matter of principle, the beneficiary of the clause should not be able to override public policy considerations that the contracting parties might have envisaged as fundamental conditions for their acceptance of the agreement in question, particularly if the beneficiary is a private investor, as is often the case.70\n\n*Maffezini*, *op. cit*. note 4, \u00a7 63.\n\n*Id.*, \u00a7 62.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n101.\n\nExamples of such necessary limits were given in the decision: the consent of the State should not be set aside through the MFN clause: when the State has conditioned its consent on the exhaustion of local remedies; when it is stated in the BIT that once a choice is made between domestic courts and international arbitration this choice is final and irreversible (this is the so-called \"fork-in-the-road\" provision); when there is a selection of a specific forum like ICSID; or when a reference is made to a highly institutionalized system of arbitration with precise rules of procedures like NAFTA. As can be seen, among the examples of situations where the MFN clause could not been used, the Tribunal gave the rule of exhaustion of local remedies, that in its view could not be set aside by an MFN clause: \"... if one contracting party has conditioned its consent to arbitration on the exhaustion of local remedies, which the ICSID Convention allows, this requirement could not be bypassed by invoking the most favored nation clause in relation to a third-party agreement that does not contain this element.\"71 I must say that I cannot see the *rationale* according to which the condition of exhaustion of local remedies could not be set aside by an MFN clause, but the condition of exhaustion of local remedies only during a certain limited period of time72 could be set aside, as was decided in *Maffezini*.\n\n*Maffezini*, *op. cit*. note 4, \u00a7 64.\n\nWhich has been described as \"a moderation of the exhaustion of local remedies rule\", *Siemens, op. cit.* note 24, \u00a7 51.\n\n102.\n\nAnother very  profound concern raised by the application of the general rule stated in *Maffezini* has already been pointed out in the decision itself, it is the risk of \"treaty shopping\". Several tribunals have raised that concern. For example, in *Salini v. Jordan,73* the tribunal refused to extend the conditions of existence of a right to ICSID arbitration provided for in Article 9 of the 1999 Italy/Jordan BIT74 and stated that it \"shares the concerns that have been expressed in numerous quarters with regard to the solution adopted in the *Maffezini* case. Its fear is that the precautions taken by authors of the award may in practice prove difficult to apply, thereby adding more uncertainties to the risk of \u2018treaty shopping'.\"75\n\n*Salini*, *op. cit.* note 7.\n\nArticle 9 - Settlement of Disputes between Investors and Contracting Parties  \n 1. Any disputes which may arise between one of the Contracting Parties and the investors of the other Contracting Party on investments, including disputes relating to the amount of compensation, shall be settled amicably, as far as possible.  \n 2. In case the investor and an entity of the Contracting Parties have stipulated an investment Agreement, the procedure foreseen in such investment Agreement shall apply.  \n 3. In the event that such dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months from the date of the written application for settlement, the investor in question may submit at his choice the dispute for settlement to:  \n (a) the Contracting Party's court having territorial jurisdiction;  \n (b) to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Center).\n\n*Salini*, *op. cit.* note 7, \u00a7 115.\n\n103.\n\nThere are also some other difficult problems raised, if the holding in *Maffezini* were to be accepted with its exceptions, which were necessary in the view of the tribunal to render the extension of jurisdiction brought about by the MFN clause acceptable.\n\n104.\n\nLet us take the example concerning the situation in which it is stated in the basic BIT that once a choice is made between domestic courts and international arbitration this choice is final and irreversible, *i.e.* the situation where a BIT provides for what has become to be known as a \"fork-in-the-road\" provision. For some unexplained reason, this is said by the tribunal in *Maffezini* to be a situation that cannot be modified by an MFN clause. If we admit this for the sake of reasoning, it is my submission that it would lend to very bizarre conclusions, if we take, for example, the two BITs at stake in our case. The Argentina/Italy BIT provides for a limited recourse to national courts for a period of 18 months before the case can possibly be submitted to arbitration. The Argentina/US BIT on the contrary has a fork-in-the-road provision and therefore does not allow submission of the case to the national courts if the investor wants to submit its case to international arbitration, which he can do on the sole condition that 6 months have elapsed since the date on which the dispute arose. According to *Maffezini*, an investor under the Argentina/Italy BIT could benefit from the direct submission to international arbitration, after 6 months have elapsed since the dispute has arisen, imported from the Argentina/US BIT, while an investor under the Argentina/US BIT, who would have first submitted the case to national courts but still would not want to be prevented to go to international arbitration by the fork-in-the-road provision, could not invoke Article 8 (2) and (3) to deport that provision. I really do not see how this kind of application of the MFN clause, required if we were to follow *Maffezini*, would bring about the intended goal of an MFN clause which is to accord the same treatment to all investors.\n\n105.\n\nAnother difficult theoretical problem is raised in the *Maffezini* approach by the fact that the MFN clause may be invoked not in the request for arbitration, but much later, often only in the answer to the State's objections to jurisdiction. As the request for arbitration stands for the investor's consent, the reciprocal consents of the State and the investor have created the jurisdictional basis for the tribunal's jurisdiction at that point in time. Is it acceptable that this arbitration agreement is thereafter upset by an arbitration offer in the incorporated BIT under the MFN clause? In other words, the *Maffezini* approach permits, after beginning one arbitration in regard to one offer in one BIT to subsequently change the arbitration agreement, and could even allow an investor after initiating an ICSID arbitration, to \"accept\" an offer in another BIT for UNCITRAL arbitration...76\n\nZachary Douglas considered these considerations to be \"fatal\" to the application of an MFN clause to dispute settlement, *op. cit*. note 6, pp. 11-12: \"There is another important consideration that is fatal to such a claim... The claimant must assert a right to more favourable treatment by claiming through the MFN clause in the basic treaty. It can only do so by instituting arbitration proceedings and thus by accepting the terms of the standing offer of arbitration in the basic treaty. At that point an arbitration agreement between the claimant and the host state comes into existence.  \n Hence there is a logical fallacy underlying the claim under consideration. The claimant can only assert the claim for MFN treatment by entering into an arbitration agreement on the terms offered by the host state in the basic treaty. But it is the terms of that arbitration agreement that the claimant is seeking to displace or modify by asserting the claim.\"\n\n106.\n\nThe problems are even more serious, as it appears that in the trend favorable to the use of MFN clause to expand jurisdiction, the position is not only to import from the third party treaty into the basic treaty the *jurisdictional clause as a whole*, but to import only *such or such aspect of a jurisdictional clause* which appears more favorable, as has been done in the majority Award: in other words there can be a \"pick and choose\" policy in the implementation of the MFN clause. This aspect has been underlined in an article on MFN clauses, where the author puts forwards the concerns raised by such an approach: \"But perhaps the most adventurous and far-reaching aspect of the *Siemens* decision was the tribunal's rejection of Argentina's further argument that, if the claimant was entitled to import the advantageous aspects of the dispute resolution provisions of the Argentina-Chile BIT, then it should also be required to import the disadvantageous aspects of those provisions. These included, in particular, a \"fork-in-the-road\" provision that was absent from the Argentina-Germany BIT. The tribunal recognised that \u2018the disadvantages may have been a trade-off for the claimed advantages', but concluded that an MFN clause \u2018relates only to more favorable treatment'. As a result, the fork-in-the-road provision could not be incorporated by operation of the MFN clause... in allowing claimants this possibility the tribunal opened the door to a potentially infinite variety of dispute resolution permutations and combinations that different investors might rely upon so as best to meet their individual circumstances.\"77\n\nStephen Fietta, Most Favoured Nation Treatment and Dispute Resolution under Bilateral Investment Treaties: a Turning Point?, *Int.A.L.R*., 2005, pp. 131-138 and also *TDM*, June 2005, Vol. 2 - Issue 3.\n\n107.\n\nIt is quite evident that a jurisdictional clause is often a complex arrangement, balancing various requirements. It does not make sense to \"de-structure\" these jurisdictional clauses, and to \"pick-and-choose\" just one element that could make sense in the global framework of the third party treaty, but does not have the same meaning in the basic treaty. The dangers of such a situation have been underscored by the legal doctrine:\n\n... it is essential when applying an MFN clause to be satisfied that the provisions relied upon as constituting more favourable treatment in the other treaty are properly applicable, and will not have the effect of fundamentally subverting the carefully negotiated balance of the BIT in question. It is submitted that this is precisely the effect of the heretical decision of the Tribunal on objections to jurisdiction in *Maffezini v Spain*.  \n...  \n It is not to be presumed that this can be disrupted by an investor selecting at will from an assorted menu of other options provided in other treaties, negotiated with other State parties and in other circumstances.78\n\nSee Campbell McLachlan and *al., op. cit.* note 11, p. 254 and p. 257.\n\n108.\n\nAs aptly pointed by *Plama*, this would create a chaotic situation.79 I suggest to avoid such a chaotic situation, in endorsing the principle that an MFN clause cannot displace any of the conditions under which a State gives its consent to arbitration to a foreign investor and would therefore endorse the *Plama* proposal, according to which the principle that should be applied to MFN clauses with regard to jurisdictional clauses\n\n... should instead be a different principle [than in *Maffezini* ] with one, single exception: an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them.80\n\n*Plama*, *op. cit.* note 8, \u00a7 219.\n\n*Id*, \u00a7 223.\n\n109.\n\nIn conclusion, for all the reasons stated above, I consider that no separate basis of jurisdiction lying in Article VII of the Argentina/US BIT can be imported through the MFN clause into the Argentina/Italy BIT. As a result, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the case.\n\n110.\n\nHaving come to the conclusion that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over the case, I reiterate that I do not comment on the results of the merits phase, but for stating that I subscribe to them."}, {"Title": "Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Judge Charles N.

Brower (Award)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nI concur with the Award (\"Award\") insofar as it 1) rejects Respondent\u2019s objections to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and 2) finds i) that Argentina violated its obligation under Article 2(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment and ii) that Claimant must be compensated for the harm it suffered as a result. With all due respect to my Tribunal colleagues, however, I disagree with their deferential attitude towards several Government actions that, in my view, also constituted violations of Argentina\u2019s fair and equitable treatment obligation. In addition, I part ways with them with respect to Claimant\u2019s claim of expropriation, which the Award dismisses on grounds that I find incapable of being reconciled with the facts in light of the applicable law. Finally, the standard of compensation adopted by the Award does not, as I see it, reflect the appropriate valuation of Claimant\u2019s venture, while the interest on damages should have been applied over a longer period of time.\n\n**II. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nI agree with the Award\u2019s holding that, whether evaluated under the \"minimum standard\" of general international law,1 or the higher standard employed in several investor-State cases,2 Argentina\u2019s conduct of which Claimant complains amounted to unfair and inequitable treatment of Claimant.3 The Award\u2019s analysis focuses, however, only on a limited array of events that include i) the emergency legislation (Federal Law No. 25,561 and Provincial Law No. 12,858) that pesified utilities contracts at parity level and froze tariffs, with devastating effect for those contracts, including AGBA\u2019s Concession Contract;4 ii) the New Regulatory Framework, a corollary of the emergency legislation that imposed additional burdens on AGBA;5 and iii) Argentina\u2019s persistent refusal to restore the concession\u2019s equilibrium.6 As detailed further below, this approach, while yielding a correct result, fails to recognize the full panoply of administrative and regulatory acts and omissions of Argentina that harmed Claimant\u2019s investment. Careful scrutiny of all these acts and omissions is important in that it can both affect the measure of compensation due and better confirm the effectiveness and legitimacy of the arbitral process.\n\nThe minimum standard is usually traced to the *Neer Case (US v. Mexico),* IV RIAA 60 (1925) and has been espoused by NAFTA tribunals but also by other investor-State panels. *See, e.g.,* *S.D. Myers, Inc. v.

Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award (Nov. 8, 2010) \u00b6 420 (\"[T]he principle of fair and equitable treatment includes the obligation not to upset an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations and the obligation to avoid arbitrary government action, regardless of whether there is any discriminatory element involved.... This means, in part, that governments must avoid arbitrarily changing the mies of the game in a manner that undermines the legitimate expectations of, or the representations made to, an investor.\"), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org; *PSEG Global Inc. v. Turkey,* ICSID Case No. 02/5, Award (Jan. 19, 2007) \u00b6 250 (holding that \"the fair and equitable treatment obligation was seriously breached by what has been described... as the \u2018roller-coaster\u2019 effect of the continuing legislative changes\") (citations omitted), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org.\n\n4.\n\nSpecifically, the Award mentions only in passing the \"inaccuracies in the data bases handed over to AGBA as concessionaire\" and takes at face value Argentina\u2019s position that it reviewed and corrected any database errors.10 In fact, the problem was more complex\u2014and Argentina\u2019s acts less innocuous. The customer database AGBA received from AGOSBA listed certain properties as vacant plots of land *((\u2018bald\u00edos\").* These \"vacant plots\" were in fact covered by buildings that required more water services. The Province had dealt with such a database disparity before: in March 2000 ORAB had issued Resolution No. 15/00, which allowed Azurix (the other water concessionaire in the Province) \"to recategorize the users... in those cases in which property is categorized as vacant lot and charged the tariff applicable to vacant lots, but the real estate valuation process carried out by the Province of Buenos Aires shows that there are constructions in such property.\"11 The Province refused, however, to provide AGBA with the same benefit by arguing that under Annex \u00d1 of the Concession Contract AGBA could not apply a higher \"tariff\u2019 than that applied by AGOSBA in its last billing period.12 AGBA objected, arguing that Annex \u00d1 concerns the \"tariff\u2019 due AGBA and not the \"price\" of water services to customers, and that it was inappropriate to rely on that Annex to resist property recategorizations that would affect only the price of the water services rendered. The Province never responded. By leaving unresolved a question that bore directly on the profitability of AGBA, and relying on a facially inapplicable provision to justify its position, the Province violated Argentina\u2019s obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimant.\n\nAward \u00b6 301. Another customer database issue that harmed AGBA\u2019s profitability was the non-inclusion of more than 80,000 customers who had been connected just prior to the privatization of AGOSBA. When AGBA attempted to collect from those customers, they were very reluctant to pay their bills, since they had not had to do so previously, resulting in non-collection rates of 70% to 80%. Walck and Giacchino Second Expert Report \u00b6 95 (citations omitted); *see also* \u00b6 III.24 & n.63 *infra.* Respondent has argued, without supporting its argument with any evidence, that prospective bidders had access to the 1998 Schroders Report, which referred to collectability problems in the concession area, including the number of non-paying customers. *See* Schroders, *Information Memorandum, Privatization of Administraci\u00f3n General Obras Sanitarias de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (\"AGOSBA \")* (Dec. 1998) Exh. C-41 (\"Schroders Report\"). Therefore, according to Respondent, Claimant should have been aware of the approximately 80,000 connected but non-paying customers. *See* Tr. Day 1, 144:20-24; Tr. Day 8, 146:20-147:4. In light of the testimony of Claimant\u2019s expert Dr. Giacchino, however, that the Schroders Report was not in fact supplied to prospective bidders, Respondent, in my view, has not met the burden of showing that Claimant was or should have been aware of the 80,000 habitually delinquent customers. *See* Tr. Day 5, 69:22-70:19 (Claimant\u2019s expert Dr. Giacchino testifying that the Schroders Report was not supplied to bidders for the Concession Contract).\n\nORAB Resolution No. 15/00 art. 1, Mar. 17, 2000, Exh.

As the Award explains,14 the terms of the concession included an obligation on the Province to construct two new waste treatment plants (Ferrari and Las Catonas) and renovate a third one (Bella Vista). Those plants, which would allow AGBA to build and expand sewer connections in accordance with the POES, were to become operational in 2001 and eventually to be transferred to AGBA at no cost. Despite these commitments, when AGBA took over the operation of the concession neither the works for construction of the Ferrari and Las Catonas plants, nor those for the reconditioning and enhancement of the Bella Vista Plant had begun. Indeed, as of mid-2000, the Province had not even launched the bidding process. The Award unfortunately does not recognize that the Province either rejected or ignored AGBA\u2019s requests to restore the contract equilibrium in light of the resulting disruption of its expectation by revisiting the POES goals (which were partially based on the plants being in service) and assessing other ways waste treatment could be addressed.15 In fact, the Province even attempted to shift responsibility for the Bella Vista plant onto AGBA.16\n\nThe term \"UNIREC\" refers to the *Unidad de Coordinaci\u00f3n del Proyecto R\u00edo Reconquista,* the Argentine State-controlled entity responsible for the construction and maintenance of the three waste treatment plants.\n\nAward \u00b6 197.\n\nAGBA Letter to ORAB, Aug. 8, 2001, Exh. C-68; AGBA Letter to ORAB, Oct. 25, 2001, Exh. C-61.\n\n*See, e.g.,* ORAB Letter to AGBA, Nov. 12, 2001, Exh. C-69.\n\n6.\n\nThe Award\u2019s rejection of Claimant\u2019s claims with respect to the UNIREC plants downplays their significance.17 The serious financial difficulties faced by Argentina in 2001 appear to have been at the root of the Province\u2019s failure to deliver those plants. Yet, Argentina has not pled successfully any defense (e.g. necessity) that would justify or excuse that failure, much less the Province\u2019s uncooperative and occasionally hostile stance vis-\u00e0-vis AGBA. It is entirely gratuitous to dismiss the impact of that failure on Claimant\u2019s concession by arguing that \"the sewer connections that poured water into such plants amounted to *merely* 34.7% of all the connections to be made by AGBA during the first five years\".18 A \"mere\" third of all connections is hardly an insignificant proportion for a project trying to \"get off the ground.\"19 More critically, the Province\u2019s failure to deliver the plants, combined with the inconsistent and uncooperative behavior of the Ministry of Public Works and the ORAB with respect to other charges and fees, signaled to AGBA\u2019s potential lenders that Argentina was not fully behind the project, and that the conditions on which AGBA\u2019s business plan had been devised could prove unrealistic, throwing into doubt the company\u2019s financing plan.20 Accordingly, the Award\u2019s recitation of the acts and omissions constituting unfair and inequitable treatment should have included the Province\u2019s failure to deliver the UNIREC plants.\n\n*See* Award \u00b6 218. The Award admits that the Province\u2019s failure to deliver the UNICREC plants \"may also have been a relevant factor affecting\" AGBA\u2019s financing prospects (Award \u00b6 366), but does not take this finding into account for liability purposes. Claimant should not have to absorb as \"business risk\" the losses caused by the nondelivery of the UNIREC plants. There was no reason for AGBA (or Claimant) to assume that the Province would renege on its important contractual obligation to make these three plants available as scheduled, and then attempt to shift onto Claimant additional costs relating to these plants.\n\nAward \u00b6 218 (emphasis added). This \"mere\" one-third of all connections translated into 378,000 customers (98,000 at Ferrari, 200,000 at Las Catonas and an additional 80,000 at Bella Vista), plus an additional 300,000 people who were not connected to the sewage network but, instead, were served by septic trucks. Walck and Giacchino Second Expert Report \u00b6 507.\n\nThis infraction alone, according to Impregilo\u2019s experts, caused the Net Present Value of AGBA to decrease $51,764,000 in July 2006 dollars, of which Impregilo\u2019s share would be $22,045,000. *See* Walck and Giacchino Expert Report \u00b6 275.\n\n*See* \u00b6 11.13 *infra.*\n\n7.\n\nThe Award performs a similarly cursory and unpersuasive review of the issue of \"work charges,\" i.e., fees that customers paid to AGBA at the time they were connected to the water and sewage services system, pursuant to Article 10 of Annex \u00d1.21 The Province effectively prevented AGBA from collecting these charges by conditioning collection on the production of voluminous information with respect to all customers who were assessed such charges. In a series of communications, the ORAB requested extraordinary amounts of detailed information about the works performed, and suspended AGBA\u2019s right to collect work charges until it had reviewed all pertinent information.22 Claimant\u2019s experts have confirmed that the requested information went well beyond evidence that regulatory authorities reasonably would require under the circumstances,23 while Argentina has failed to justify the breadth of the Province\u2019s requests. The evidence shows that a plausible explanation for the Province\u2019s behavior lies in the political pressure that property owners exerted on the Province to resist the work charges.24 Thus, far from being \"a typical contractual dispute which cannot involve responsibility under the BIT,\"25 the Province\u2019s substantial interference with AGBA\u2019s ability to collect work charges amounted to nothing less than deliberate abuse of administrative power with a political motive\u2014and therefore a breach of Argentina\u2019s fair and equitable treatment obligation.\n\n*See* Award \u00b6 303.\n\n*See, e.g.,* ORAB Letter to AGBA, July 10, 2001, Exh. C-100; Cerruti Witness Statement \u00b6\u00b6 93-94 (recounting ORAB\u2019s numerous information requests); ORAB Resolution No. 14/02, Feb. 18, 2002, Exh.

C-277; Cerruti Witness Statement \u00b6 90, Exh. C-60. The charges were fairly significant (US$150 for water and US$ 350 for sewage), and were to be paid not by individual customers but by the owners, possessors or holders of the properties that benefited from the work. Concession Contract Annex \u00d1, \u00a7 10, Exh. C-l 1.\n\nAward \u00b6 303.\n\n8.\n\nThe Award again averts its gaze from the Province\u2019s bureaucratic maneuvers on the issue of the sewage coefficient. Article 4 of Annex \u00d1 to the Concession Contract conditioned the increase of the coefficient for each concession year on the satisfaction of the expansion goals in the POES for the preceding year. On August 27, 2001, the ORAB\u2019s Technical Division issued a report, complete with underlying reasoning and factual findings, concluding that AGBA had complied with the POES goals for the year 2000.26 This determination entitled AGBA to seek an increase of the sewage coefficient to the level set for year 2001. Six weeks later, however, on October 10, 2001, the ORAB\u2019s Technical Division issued a letter, signed by the same persons as the August report, stating that AGBA had *not* complied with its 2000 POES obligations.27\n\nOpinion by ORAB Technical Division, Aug. 27, 2001, Exh. RA 277.\n\nLetter from ORAB Technical Division to AGBA, Oct. 17, 2001, Exh. C-105. Regrettably, the Award\u2019s characterization of these events is incomplete and therefore misleading. According to the Award, \"the Argentine authorities showed a considerable degree of *indulgence and tolerance* towards any deficiencies that existed in AGBA\u2019s performance. On August 27, 2001, ORAB\u2019s Technical Department declared that AGBA\u2019s performance during the first year of the concession had shown an acceptable degree of compliance with the POES....\" Without mentioning any subsequent events, the Award continues: \"Even one year later, on December 2, 2002, the Technical Department of ORAB, in a Report to the President of ORAB, declared that AGBA had essentially satisfied the goals established for the first concession year 2000.\" Award \u00b6 253 (emphasis added).\n\n9.\n\nAfter reversing itself without adequate justification, the Province requested additional information regarding works performed by AGBA. According to the testimony of Claimant\u2019s experts, the requested information was uncommonly and unduly extensive;28 effectively it amounted to a full audit of AGBA.29 Compounding the delay caused by its broad requests, the Province rejected information that AGBA supplied, adding further requests in the process.30 Eventually, in December 2002, the Province again reached the conclusion that AGBA had complied with the 2000 POES, 15 months after its original determination to the same effect.31 This would prove a hollow victory for AGBA, for when AGBA sought to apply the increased sewage coefficient to the period between August 2001 and December 2002, the Province refused by shifting the blame for its belated determination onto AGBA\u2019s untimely furnishing of information, instead of its own expansive and ever-changing information requests. This decision directly harmed AGBA\u2019s profitability. In light of the above facts, I am unable to accept the Award\u2019s conclusion that there is \"no basis for concluding that... [the Province\u2019s] assessment was unjustified or that it was in any way a misuse of State power.\"32 Administrative capriciousness and indifference, let alone deliberate delay that undermines the profitability of an investment, are well-established grounds for finding a fair and equitable treatment violation.33\n\nWalck and Giacchino Second Expert Report \u00b6 306, Exh. C-368.\n\nFor example, regarding renovation and reconditioning work, the ORAB asked for:  \n the precise location of every renovation and or reconditioning performed and the meters involved. The format of the requested information should include, at a minimum, the type of service, location, street, pavement (even or odd), between streets, diameter of piping, material, length of brackets, renovation or reconditioning (indicating if it was one or the other), partial summaries, and total summaries.  \n The ORAB made similarly extensive requests regarding expansion of service; infrastructure works; and water pressure. ORAB Letter to AGBA, Jan. 17, 2002, Exhibit to Molinari AM50 at 405.\n\nOn April 3, 2002, the ORAB\u2019s Technical Division wrote to the ORAB rejecting the method that AGBA used to calculate the length of renovated piping, finding that the expansion and infrastructure information was incomplete, and declaring that the format of the provided information was incorrect. Only two months later, on June 11, 2002, did the ORAB finally forward the April 3, 2002 letter to AGBA, which made additional efforts to comply with the Technical Division\u2019s additional requests. ORAB Letter No. 1509/02, June 11, 2002, Exhibit to Molinari AM50 at 412.\n\nThe Award refers to this 15-month delay as \"a long period of reflection\" on the part of the Province. Award \u00b6\n\nAward \u00b6 304.\n\n*See. e.g.,* *PSEG Global Inc. v. Turkey,* ICSID Case No. 02/5, Award (Jan. 19, 2007) \u00b6\u00b6 246, 248-49 (holding that regulatory inaction and delay, along with inconsistent treatment of the investment, can give rise to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org.\n\n10.\n\nThe Award\u2019s analysis of Claimant\u2019s right to interrupt service for non-payment is also deficient. The Award notes correctly that under Article 29 of Annex \u00d1 the Province was entitled in \"extraordinary circumstances\" to direct AGBA to continue service despite nonpayment.34 Implicitly reasoning that the 2001 Argentine crisis constituted such \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the Award simply absolves Argentina of any wrongdoing, while ignoring the fact that Argentina did *not* reinstate AGBA\u2019s right to interrupt connections of non-paying customers after the economic crisis ended\u2014which it would have been expected to do if the suspension of that right occurred pursuant to the Contract.35 The sources relied upon by Argentina\u2019s own experts show that the inability to interrupt service for non-payment affects adversely a water utility operator\u2019s ability to collect fees.36 Consequently, the Province\u2019s failure to reinstate AGBA\u2019s right to cut off service to non-paying customers should have been included in the Award as yet another instance of unfair and inequitable treatment of Claimant under the BIT.\n\n313. The Award fails to recognize the delay, costs, and uncertainty introduced by the ORAB\u2019s inconsistent behavior and is content to note only that \"[t]he position... adopted by the authorities appears... to be somewhat ambiguous.\" Award \u00b6 368.\n\nAward \u00b6 306.\n\nAGBA protested ORAB Resolution No. 56/02 of 27 August 2002, in which ORAB suspended this right, but the objection, as the Award itself notes in paragraph 258, was not answered by the Undersecretary of Public Services until 25 August 2005 - nearly three years later. Although there seems to be no broad consensus as to the precise moment the Argentine crisis ended, it has been placed as early as April 2003, nearly two years before Argentina\u2019s response. *See LG&E v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability (Oct. 3, 2006) \u00b6 244 (holding that \"the Tribunal has determined, as a factual matter that the grave crisis in Argentina lasted from 1 December 2001 until 26 April 2003\"), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org. Similarly, Claimant\u2019s tariffs remained pesified until the end of the Concession, *see* n.73 *infra.*\n\nDapena and Coloma First Expert Report \u00b6 85 (citing OFWAT, *Industry-level detail on household revenue outstanding and associated recovery costs* (London, Office of Water Regulation, 2008)).\n\n11.\n\nFurthermore, the Award finds nothing \"inconsistent with any rule in the Concession Contract\" in the Province\u2019s decision to obligate AGBA to install service meters upon customer request, apparently because \"AGBA... was subject to the control and regulation of ORAB as Regulatory Agency.\"37 This cursory holding oversimplifies the problem, however, and obscures the extent to which the Province misused its power to undermine Claimant\u2019s investment. In directing AGBA to install meters upon request,38 the Province relied on Article 29 of the Regulatory Framework, which provided that after meters are installed \"according to the periods of time established in the concession agreement\" the Concessionaire would bill the user on the meter.39 Thus, the timing of the meter installation would be governed by the Concession Contract. The Contract in turn provides that meters will be installed according to the POES, which was designed and implemented by AGBA. Because of the Province\u2019s actions, however, AGBA had to invest in metering mechanisms in accordance with customers\u2019 whims. The inability to control the timing and location of meter installation severely disrupted AGBA\u2019s investment plan because it introduced unpredictability of expenditures. More importantly, it hindered the collection of customer accounts, because customers with low consumption had an incentive to install meters first, while those with high consumption were better off waiting\u2014and delaying the proper assessment of their charges. It follows that the Province\u2019s decision as to meter installation was so unsupported by either the Contract or applicable regulations as to be considered arbitrary and therefore violative of Argentina\u2019s obligation to treat Claimant\u2019s investment fairly and equitably.\n\nAward \u00b6 307.\n\nORAB Resolution No. 85/00 (Nov. 21, 2000), art. 23.\n\nLaw No. 11,820 art. 29(11), Exh. C-9.\n\n12.\n\nThere are additional events that likewise fit into the pattern of the Province\u2019s disruptive actions, but receive no treatment in the Award. Specifically, the Award does not mention the reversal of position of the Ministry of Public Works with respect to a Memorandum of Understanding requested by AGBA in May 2001 aimed to restore the contract equilibrium, which had been disrupted by the Province\u2019s failure to deliver the UNIREC plants and its obstruction of AGBA\u2019s efforts to collect several fees it was due under the Concession Contract. The MOU was critical to AGBA\u2019s efforts to obtain financing.40 While in May 2001 the Minister appeared amenable to cooperating with AGBA,41 in August 2001 he notified AGBA that the Ministry would no longer be able to conclude the MOU because of ongoing negotiations with Azurix.42 Notably, as discussed above, during the same month (August 2001) the ORAB Technical Division issued the report confirming AGBA\u2019s compliance with the terms of the POES\u2014a finding that the Technical Division retracted only two months later without adequate justification. Moreover, while the report recommended suspension of AGBA\u2019s POES obligations, that suspension did not become effective for another 15 months due to ever-expanding information requests by the Province.\n\nThe Award notes that in May 2001 \"AGBA requested that the Concession Contract be renegotiated and its obligations be suspended, claiming as a reason the high uncollectability rate and its difficulties in obtaining financing.\" Award \u00b6 216. AGBA\u2019s claim seems plausible. As Claimant\u2019s witness Mr. Cerruti explains, financing for projects such as the one at issue is finalized after the signing of the Concession, because \"it is the Contract itself that gets securitized.\" Cerruti Supplemental Statement \u00b6 20. Thus, performance during the early stages of the concession is critical. Nevertheless, the Award hastily adds without elaboration that \"[t]hese were two risks that had been voluntarily assumed by AGBA as concessionaire.\" Thus, the Award simply discounts the possibility that the \"high uncollectability rate\" and associated financing problems had been caused at least partially by the Province\u2019s obstructive acts and stalling. *See* n.10, *supra.*\n\nLetter from the Undersecretary of Public Works to AGBA, May 30, 2001, Exh. C-144.\n\nLetter from AGBA to the Governor of Buenos Aires, Sept 13, 2001, Exh. C-145.\n\n13.\n\nThus, by October 2001 Argentina had taken a series of steps that raised serious concerns among AGBA\u2019s prospective lenders, thereby jeopardizing AGBA\u2019s financing.43 Specifically, Argentina had: i) retracted its offer to cooperate with AGBA with respect to financing, while extending cooperation to another foreign investor; ii) cast doubt on AGBA\u2019s compliance with the POES for 15 months, rendering the status of the Contract uncertain; and iii) caused the same 15-month delay in the suspension of the POES requirements, raising questions as to whether AGBA would be able to meet them. Argentina\u2019s obstruction of AGBA\u2019s financing was detrimental to the success of the project and certainly rose to the level of a fair and equitable treatment violation.\n\nAn OPIC letter dated 21 September 2001 noted that there was \"uncertainty on tariffs,\" \"regulatory inaction,\" and a \"lack of commitment\" exhibited by Argentina that impacted adversely OPIC\u2019s evaluation of a potential investment in AGBA. *See* Exh. C-214. Meanwhile, independent consultant Halcrow, hired by another prospective lender, the Inter-American Development Bank, identified as an investment risk the ORAB\u2019s accessibility to \"political and other interested pressure groups.\" Halcrow, *Aguas del Gran Buenos Aires Inter-American Development Bank Regulatory Analysis - Draft Report* (2001), Exh. C-147.\n\n14.\n\nThe Province continued to adopt measures of questionable legal foundation and definitively adverse impact on the project several years after the beginning of the country\u2019s economic crisis. Thus, in April 2005 the Province resolved44 to prohibit AGBA from enforcing unpaid bills against unemployed customers, based on a January 2005 law that prevented mortgage foreclosures for 180 days if the inhabitant showed he or she was unemployed.45 The Province not only ignored AGBA\u2019s arguments that the law purportedly underlying the Resolution concerned real estate mortgages and not water services; it also ensured that the law would be misapplied. Thus, in its Resolution the Province turned on its head the law\u2019s requirement that the unemployed customer furnish proof of unemployment, and instead directed AGBA to show that the customers against whom it sought collection were in fact *not* unemployed.46 Such clear contravention of the letter of the law is indeed arbitrary and certainly should have been included among the Award\u2019s grounds for finding that Argentina\u2019s treatment of Claimant was unfair and inequitable.\n\nORAB Resolution No. 7/05, \u00a71, Apr. 20, 2005, Exh. C-125\n\nLaw No. 13,302, Exh. C-126. The law subsequently was extended twice; *see* Laws No. 13,590 and No. 13,738, both at Exh. C-127.\n\nORAB Resolution No. 7/05, \u00a71, Apr. 20, 2005, Exh. C-125.\n\n15.\n\nThe above review, combined with those acts that the Award *does* consider as fair and equitable treatment violations,47 reveals a \"behavioral pattern\" in the form of unreasonable legislative and regulatory burdens, delays, unduly extensive information requests, and costraising tactics on the part of the Province\u2014acts that transcend the boundary of mere \"contractual violations\" and constitute in fact substantial and undue interference with Claimant\u2019s investment that is actionable and indeed compensable under Article 2(2) of the BIT.\n\nAward \u00b6 316 ff.\n\n16.\n\nSubject to the above observations, I concur with the holding of Section V.C.(v) of the Award concerning fair and equitable treatment.\n\n**III. EXPROPRIATION**\n----------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Award is content to reject Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim because \"the Province, *with some justification,* considered that AGBA had grossly failed in fulfilling its contractual obligations and terminated the Concession Contract on this basis.\"48 According to the Award, this fact alone suffices \"to exclude that the termination could be regarded as an act of - direct or indirect - expropriation or other appropriation of AGBA\u2019s property or Impregilo\u2019s investment.\"49\n\nAward \u00b6 283 (emphasis added).\n\nAward \u00b6 283.\n\n18.\n\nWith respect, this conclusion is wrong as a matter of law. Given the ample evidence in the record that the termination of AGBA\u2019s concession was a foreordained political decision that Argentina merely sought to carry out in a facially lawful manner, it is decidedly *not* sufficient to determine, without more, that the host State has terminated the Concession Contract lawfully, based on breaches of contract by the Claimant. Nor is the host State\u2019s superficial evocation of a contractual termination clause enough to \"sweep under the carpet\" a series of administrative and regulatory acts and omissions designed to extinguish the project\u2019s value and to waylay any chance of success the project had. I set out my criticisms of the Award\u2019s holding in greater detail below.\n\n19.\n\nArticle 5 of the Argentina-Italy BIT provides, in relevant part:\n\n[1](b) Investments by investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be nationalized, expropriated, seized or otherwise appropriated, either directly or indirectly, through measures having an equivalent effect in the territory of the other Party, unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n\u2014 the measures are for a public purpose, of national interest or security.\n\n\u2014 they are taken in accordance with due process of law;\n\n\u2014 they are non-discriminatory or contrary to the commitments undertaken;\n\n\u2014 they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n\u2026\n\n2. The provisions laid out in paragraph 1 hereof shall also apply to the returns from an investment as well as, in the event of liquidation, the proceeds thereof.\n\n20.\n\nThe Award places emphasis on the fact that Claimant never lost title to its property, i.e., its shares in AGBA.50 This is true, but also irrelevant since the BIT prohibits expropriation committed \"directly or indirectly, through measures having an equivalent effect...\" unless certain specifically enumerated conditions are fulfilled cumulatively.\n\nAward \u00b6 271.\n\n21.\n\nA substantial body of jurisprudence and scholarly opinion also recognizes that formal appropriation or extinguishment of title to property is not the only way an investor can be deprived of property in contravention of an applicable BIT. Instead, the host State can take actions and enact measures that are tantamount to expropriation, and constitute \"indirect\" expropriation,51 which becomes \"creeping\" expropriation when the expropriatory measures take effect over a period of time.52 In such cases, the analysis must focus not on the form of the alleged expropriatory measures, but on their actual substance and corresponding cumulative impact.53 Furthermore, although the government\u2019s underlying intentions are not a necessary legal element of an indirect or creeping expropriation claim,54 such a claim can be bolstered by evidence of a broader policy decision that assigns common purpose to the individual measures leading to the investor\u2019s property deprivation.55\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Metalclad v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, (Aug. 30, 2000) \u00b6 103 (holding that \"[expropriation encompasses] not only open, deliberate, and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the economic benefit of the host State\"), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org; *Starred Housing Corp. v.

The tribunal in *Generation Ukraine* ultimately dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* but this does not affect the validity of its legal analysis of creeping expropriation.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Teemed S.A. v.

[S]uch prevention of [joint venture partner] MDCL from pursuing its approved project would constitute constructive expropriation of MDCL\u2019s contractual rights in the project and, accordingly, the expropriation of the value of Mr Biloune\u2019s interest in MDCL....\")\n\n*See* Andrew Newcombe, *The Boundaries of Regulatory Expropriation in International Law,* 20 ICSID Rev.\u2014 FILJ 1 (2005) (\"The fact that intent is unnecessary does not make it irrelevant to the determination of whether or not a government measure is expropriatory.... Where there is evidence of intent to expropriate, it is unlikely that a state could rely on the good faith exercise of its police powers as justification for non-compensation.\") (citations omitted).\n\n22.\n\nIn light of the above legal principles, the Award\u2019s analysis of Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim is deficient in several ways. It commences with an incomplete description of Article 5 of the BIT, which Article mentions not only \"expropriation at the same level as nationalization, seizure and other appropriation,\"56 but also *indirect* expropriation, which as discussed is different from each of those three. The Award subsequently recognizes, nevertheless, that \"restrictions on the use of property [that] go so far as to leave the investor with only a nominal property right... could in appropriate cases be regarded as indirect expropriation,\"57 but concludes, in my view wrongly, that \"none of the [] measures [taken by Argentina] amounted to a loss of the concession. Nor could the joint effect of these measures be considered to be a loss of property rights.\"58\n\nAward \u00b6 269.\n\nAward \u00b6 270.\n\nAward \u00b6 272.\n\n23.\n\nThe Award\u2019s main (and implicitly made) argument in support of this conclusion appears to be that while Argentina can be blamed *partially* for the failure of Claimant\u2019s investment, it is not *entirely* responsible for it,59 and therefore is not liable for expropriation. This argument is fallacious because, similar to the Award\u2019s fair and equitable treatment discussion, it does not accord the relevant facts either sufficient attention or appropriate legal import.\n\nThis \"balancing\" is revealed more clearly in the Award\u2019s discussion of compensation, Award \u00b6\u00b6 376-77.\n\n24.\n\nIn particular, while the Award recognizes that \"the Province did not deliver on time the UNIREC plants which it had undertaken to deliver in 2001\" and that \"[t]his affected AGBA\u2019s ability to expand sewage connections in certain areas,\" it hastens to add that there were \"other treatment plants which should have been established by AGBA itself but which could not be completed due to insufficient funds.\"60 The Award fails to note, however, that this dearth of funds was at least partially *caused* by the failure to deliver the UNIREC plants, since that failure and other acts and omissions of Argentina created serious misgivings among AGBA\u2019s potential lenders as to the viability of the project.61 Similarly, the Award\u2019s passing reference to \"an unexpected incorporation of a large number of additional users with a particularly low collectability rate\" that \"made it more difficult for AGBA to live up to some of its undertakings\"62 downplays both the cause and the magnitude of the problem. In fact, because of Argentina\u2019s incomplete customer databases, AGBA was confronted with more than 80,000 additional unregistered and habitually delinquent users in the early stages of the concession63\u2014a development that not only hampered AGBA\u2019s achievement of the POES goals, but also lowered further the attractiveness of AGBA to potential lenders.\n\nAward \u00b6 280.\n\n*See supra.*\n\nAward \u00b6 280.\n\n*See* n.10 *supra.* In response to the question of whether the collection problems were foreseeable, AGBA Manager Mr. Cerruti explained:  \n Well, actually not, because the problem that AGBA faced as of the second half of 2000 was the problem of unusual lack of credibility, due to the fact that about 80,000 customers had come in, had been brought in. These customers had a payment behavior which was very different from the rest of the customers. To give you an order of magnitude, we had a collectability of about 20% with the new customers, whilst collectability for the rest of the customers was about 65/70%.  \n Tr. Day 2, 141:11-19.\n\n25.\n\nFurthermore, the Award fails to address as expropriatory others of Argentina\u2019s acts and omissions that cumulatively diminished AGBA\u2019s value. These include the Province\u2019s refusal to re-characterize built-upon land originally listed as \"vacant\"; the Province\u2019s deliberate diminishment of AGBA\u2019s profitability by obstructing the collection of several fees and charges such as connection charges, the increased sewage coefficient, and service interruption charges; the Ministry of Public Works\u2019 uncooperative stance that derailed AGBA\u2019s financing efforts; the several-months-long delays and elevated costs caused by ORAB\u2019s ever-expanding requests for information; the issuance of several other administrative decisions and decrees directed solely against the investment such as ORAB Resolution No. 4/02 and Law 12,858, which the Award concludes dealt the project a fatal blow by pesifying unilaterally AGBA\u2019s water and sewage concession; Decree No. 878/03 that introduced the so-called \"New Regulatory Framework\" and was, according to the Award, \"clearly disadvantageous to the concessionaire\";64 Decree No. 1666/06, which terminated on formalistic grounds the Concession Contract and AGBA\u2019s entire corporate *raison d\u2019etre',* and, finally, Decree No. 1677/06, which transferred responsibility over all water and sewage provision in AGBA\u2019s Concession region directly to ABSA, a State-owned enterprise. Applied in succession over a period of years, Argentina\u2019s acts left Claimant in possession of shares in an empty corporate shell, which had been deprived of all purpose and value.\n\nAward \u00b6 328.\n\n26.\n\nInstead, the Award merely juxtaposes AGBA\u2019s alleged inability to meet the POES goals that the Province cited as the reason to terminate the Contract on the one hand65 and some of the ways in which the obstruction, delay, and uncertainty introduced by Argentina contributed to AGBA\u2019s failure on the other.66 This presentation showcases a small portion of Argentina\u2019s acts that violated the BIT, but fails both to delineate a chain of causation showing which *specific* acts by AGBA contributed to the project\u2019s failure, and to set forth the legal basis on which such acts were found to be sufficient to defeat Claimant\u2019s claim of expropriation.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 273-74, 279.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 280-82.\n\n27.\n\nSignificantly, the Award leaves entirely unresolved the issue of whether the Province\u2019s 2001 suspension of the POES requirements was meant to endure until the parties reestablished the equilibrium of the Contract.67 It therefore implicitly accepts that AGBA may not have been in breach of the Concession Contract at all, undercutting the formalistic reasoning of the termination decree and leaving Argentina\u2019s actions as the only cause of the concession\u2019s demise. Yet, in the very next paragraph the Award bypasses this cardinal question by stating that \"it is not decisive whether or not the Province had a correct understanding of AGBA\u2019s obligations under the Concession Contract.\"68 Irrespective of what the Province understood, the Tribunal is required to attain a thorough and well-substantiated understanding of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the Contract. If, as Claimant has argued, the suspension of the POES goals extended beyond 2001, the \"decisive question\" of \"whether the reasons given for the termination constituted a legally valid ground for termination according to the provisions of the Concession Contract\"69 must be answered in the negative, and the Award\u2019s view on expropriation becomes unsustainable even under the Award\u2019s own formalistic approach.\n\nAward \u00b6 282, 369. *But see* Award \u00b6 314 (holding that the suspension of the POES was \"for the second concession year 2001 with the effect that measures which had not been accomplished during that year should not lead to penalties....\")\n\nAward \u00b6 283.\n\nAward \u00b6 278.\n\n28.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the Award adopts an equivocal and poorly reasoned view with respect to the political motivations quite evidently underlying the termination of the Concession Contract by the Province. While it accepts \"that the Argentine administration may have set up as a political goal to transfer water and sewerage services to public entities,\" the Award dismisses this important fact by relying on the proposition that \"the fact that an issue becomes a political matter... does not mean that the existence of a rational policy is erased.\"70 The quoted sentence appears out of context from a factually and legally inapposite case.71\n\nAward \u00b6 277.\n\n*AES Summit Gen. Ltd. and AES-Tisza Er\u00f4m\u00fc Kft v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22 (ECT), Award (Sept. 17, 2010) \u00b6 10.3.23, *available at* http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/AESvHungaryAward.pdf. The quote stems from the *AES* tribunal's analysis of the FET standard of the ECT, not a discussion of indirect expropriation under a BIT, where an underlying political motivation may not be required as an element of liability but helps \"connect\" the steps leading to the substantial or total deprivation of property suffered by claimant.\n\n29.\n\nStill, to the extent the Award\u2019s reference to \"rationality\" alludes to the State\u2019s right to exercise its police power, the Award has failed to explain which of the measures taken by Argentina would constitute exercise of that power, and on what grounds.72 Moreover, as detailed further below, the Award has ignored a wealth of evidence demonstrating that the gradual \"wearing down\" and eventual total devaluation of AGBA was a predetermined national political goal that the Argentine authorities sought to achieve while \"maintaining appearances\" in the hope of avoiding liability. Such behavior hardly meets the standard of *bona fides* that must characterize any legitimate exercise of police powers by the State. Moreover, even if the evidence were not enough to substantiate a political motive behind the termination, the arbitrary and unjustified character of Argentina\u2019s individual acts precludes their legitimacy.\n\n*See Sedeo, Inc. v Nat\u2019l Iranian Oil Co.,* 9 Iran-US Cl. Trib. 248, 275 (1985) (referencing as \"an accepted principle of international law that a State is not liable for economic injury which is a consequence of a bona fide \u2018regulation\u2019 within the accepted police power of states\").\n\n30.\n\nIf the various prohibitions on collecting service charges and late fees did not clearly illustrate the Province\u2019s hostile stance towards AGBA, the unilateral and targeted pesification of the Concession Contract in 2002 certainly did. The Argentine Government\u2019s Law No. 25,561 that, *inter alia,* abrogated the US dollar tariffs in certain concessions and licenses did not apply to AGBA automatically, because the Argentine federal system delegates public services regulation to the provinces. By January 11, 2002, the Province had not yet enacted a law mirroring the provisions of Law No. 25,561, yet the ORAB preemptively resolved to pesify AGBA\u2019s tariff through Resolution ORAB No. 4/02\u2014although its authority to do so was by no means established.73 The Province\u2019s Congress subsequently enacted Law No. 12,858, which entitled the Provincial Executive Branch to \"organize, structure, and/or adjust the regulatory frameworks\" *only* of the \"sanitation, running water supply, and sewage public services.\" With respect to other utilities, Law No. 12,858 provided for the creation of a commission and the conduct of further analysis prior to pesification. In the case of AGBA, it entitled the Province to alter the regulatory framework before any analysis was conducted.74 These facts are highly suggestive that at least as of early 2002 the Province had resolved to undermine AGBA and resume control of the concession.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits \u00b6 249 (citing ORAB Resolution No. 4/02, Jan. 11, 2002, Exh. C-134). The expert report of Claimant\u2019s expert Prof. Mairal suggests that this ORAB-driven pesification was highly irregular in its inception and implementation:  \n AGBA\u2019s tariffs were pesified by a resolution of the regulatory agency even prior to the enactment of Law No. 12,858. They remained frozen at that level up to the end of the Concession in 2006, notwithstanding that the provincial emergency legislation was not extended beyond December 31, 2004.  \n*See* Mairal Expert Report \u00b6 105, Exh. C-267.\n\nLaw No. 12,858, Article 3 states: \"The Province of Buenos Aires adheres to Section 8 of Law No. 25,561 and to Sections 9 and 10 thereof, subject to the previous ratification of the renegotiations and adjustment of public services agreements by the Legislature of the Province of Buenos Aires, as provided in Section 1 above.\" (Exh. C-135).\n\n31.\n\nThe heavy political undertones of the concession\u2019s termination figured prominently  at the hearing on the merits, during the juxtaposition of the witness statement and oral testimony of Mr. Diaz, Chairman of AGBA\u2019s Board of Directors, with that of Minister Eduardo Sicaro, who at the time the Concession Contract was terminated served as Secretary of Public Services in the Province\u2019s Infrastructure Ministry. Specifically, Mr. Diaz\u2019s statement described a meeting held at the Ministry\u2019s offices in mid-July 2006, at which Minister Sicaro informed Mr. Diaz in no uncertain terms that the Province had decided to terminate AGBA\u2019s Concession Contract purely for political reasons, namely to fall into line with the Federal Government\u2019s termination of the Aguas Argentinas concession.75 In that discussion Minister Sicaro, according to Mr. D\u00edaz, also rejected as politically unviable AGBA\u2019s proposal to end the concession by mutual decision, and assured Mr. Diaz that AGBA would receive compensation through legal action.76 Mr. Diaz reaffirmed this account during his testimony at the hearing.77 Mr. Facchinetti, Director and Executive Vice President of AGBA, who also was present at that same meeting, corroborated this account of events in his own witness statement and during the hearing78\n\n*See* Diaz Witness Statement \u00b6 8 (\"During this [July 2006] meeting, the Province\u2019s representatives stated that, out of consideration for AGBA, they wanted to personally inform us beforehand that the Decree to terminate the concession contract had already been drafted and was going to be formally announced promptly.

Minister Sicaro then stated that the termination had to be due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault.

Finally, we were told that very frankly the idea was that once AGBA's contract was terminated, it would be managed within ABSA as a separate business unit from the rest, due to the way in which the work had been carried out and due to the efficiency of the company.\")\n\n32.\n\nMinister Sicaro\u2019s witness statement was dated more than two and a half months after that of Mr. Diaz79 In that statement, Minister Sicaro confirmed expressly Mr. Diaz\u2019s presence at the July 2006 meeting and that Mr. Diaz raised the issue of compensation to AGBA for the termination of its concession by the Province.80 Surprisingly, Minister Sicaro\u2019s statement did not even attempt to rebut Mr. Diaz\u2019s earlier statement to the effect that the termination of the concession was entirely a political act that was to be \"dressed up\" as an allegation of breach of contract. Minister Sicaro, when confronted with this glaring omission at the hearing, testified that he had not read Mr. Diaz\u2019s witness statement either before signing his own, which clearly was submitted in reply to Mr. Diaz\u2019s witness statement, or indeed at any time before testifying at the hearing.81 In response to questions from the Tribunal about the alleged political motivations underlying the termination of the concession, Minister Sicaro simply rehearsed the decree\u2019s formalistic justifications for the decision and that the Regulatory Framework and the Contract itself provide for termination of the Concession. According to Minister Sicaro, the July 2006 meeting had taken place to inform AGBA\u2019s representatives of the forthcoming decree\u2014there were no political reasons motivating it.82 In addition, Minister Sicaro said, AGBA had already stated in a letter dated June 14, 2006 (almost a month before the meeting) that it was considering itself terminating the Concession Contract unilaterally, which, according to Minister Sicaro, disproved Mr. Diaz\u2019s statement that at that July 2006 meeting AGBA proposed terminating the contract by mutual decision.83\n\nAddressing the several glaring similarities between his statement and that of Respondent\u2019s witness Mr. Seillant Minister Sicaro testified that they were purely coincidental, that he had drafted his statement by himself and that he had not seen Mr. Seillant\u2019s witness statement *See* Tr. Day 3, 76:7-80:3.\n\nTr. Day 3,86:14-87:6\n\n*See* Tr. Day 3, 89:17-20 (\"JUDGE BROWER: It is your testimony, as I understand it, that this is the first time you have seen this [Mr. Diaz\u2019s] witness statement. [MINISTER SICARO]: Yes.\"); 90:1-12 (\"JUDGE BROWER: You \u2018re quite sure, I take it, from your testimony, that it was not from having seen this witness statement of Mr. Diaz that you referred in paragraph 28 of your witness statement to la consulta of Se\u00f1or Diaz? [MINISTER SICARO] : No. JUDGE BROWER: Your answer is potentially ambiguous in light of the question.... [MINISTER SICARO] : No, I have not read this document.\")\n\n*See, e.g.,* Tr. Day 3, 90:16-91:20 (\"JUDGE BROWER: Would you turn to paragraph 8 of Se\u00f1or Diaz\u2019s statement? I call your attention to the text beginning at the second sentence in the English text.... I quote: \"We were then explained that the motivation of this termination was purely political. In fact, Minister Sicaro informed us that the Province had decided to terminate AGBA\u2019s Concession Contract because they had to follow the same course of action that the national government had taken with respect to Aguas Argentinas\u2019 Concession Contract.... Is that statement of Mr. Diaz correct or not? [MINISTER SICARO:] No, it isn\u2019t correct. It is clear that if we inform them about the motivations of the termination decree, it is not consistent with what Diaz says here. The concession [sic] decree does not speak of the fact that this was as result of Aguas Argentinas\u2019 concession ending.... So if we were telling them about the decree, no way could we have said what Mr. Diaz mentions here.\")\n\n*See* Tr. Day 3, 94:25-95:9 (\"[MINISTER SICARO]: [I]nthis case, AGBA had already told the Province that it wanted to terminate the contract. I don\u2019t understand why they say now that they were doing - or they were going to do it by common agreement. So at no time did we speak about that subject, and it is clear that if a compensation would be due, it would have to be done under the terms in which the contract states forth, where compensations would be due to them, which is what they are claiming for before the Argentinian courts, and if they have the right to it, they will collect it.\").\n\n33.\n\nMinister Sicaro\u2019s testimony regarding the termination decree\u2019s political character, in my view, was patently evasive and definitely not credible.84 The superficial reasoning contained in the termination decree, which reasoning Minister Sicaro rehashed, is not probative as to the political motivations and decisions underlying the decree. Furthermore, it is true that by mid-June 2006 AGBA had formally requested that the Province provide a response to the issues it raised in its letter and issued an ultimatum; namely, that AGBA itself would terminate the Concession if the Province\u2019s obligations had not been duly performed and the terms of the Concession not readjusted within a 45-day period. However, this period had *not* elapsed when the Province terminated the Concession in mid-July. In fact, it is quite likely, in my view, that the Province\u2019s termination decree was expedited in order to preempt a termination by AGBA.\n\nNotably, my colleagues have failed to draw *any* inference from the combination of the witness statements and hearing testimony of Messrs. Diaz and Facchinetti on the one hand, and Minister Sicaro on the other. I recognize that the cause may lie in their civil law training, which discounts entirely the testimony of party representatives. *See, e.g.,* John H. Langbein, *The German Advantage in Civil Procedure,* 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 823, 834 (1985) (explaining that German law \"distinguishes parties from witnesses\" and noting that \"German judges are given to marked and explicit doubts about the reliability of testimony of witnesses who previously have discussed the case with counsel or who have consorted unduly with a party.\") (citations omitted). In the context of investment arbitration, however, where witnesses usually are party representatives whose actions he at the heart of the dispute, rigid application of this approach denies arbitrators (and ultimately the parties) the many benefits of oral evidence by anyone other than designated impartial experts. In the present case, the statements and testimony or Messrs. Diaz and Facchinetti are, in my view, clearly more compatible with the facts of the case, while the written and oral testimony of Minister Sicaro cannot at all be reconciled with those facts.\n\n34.\n\nFinally, the Award\u2019s conclusion that the Province\u2019s termination decree was legitimately based on the failure of AGBA to meet its Concession Contract obligations cannot be reconciled with the its conclusion that Claimant was denied fair and equitable treatment by the 2002 pesification of that Contract. It is common ground that AGBA\u2019s POES obligations for the year 2000 were ruled by the Argentinean authorities to have been met. It is also common ground that Claimant\u2019s POES obligations for 2001 were suspended. Therefore, no breach of the Concession Contract could be asserted as to either of those years. ORAB pesified the Concession Contract 11 days after the end of 2001, namely on 11 January 2002, which the Award finds, together with the federal and provincial pesification decrees, to have violated Argentina\u2019s obligation of fair and equitable treatment. If, as we have ruled, AGBA was subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment in violation of the relevant treaty provision starting at the beginning of 2002,85 by what logic can it be possibly be concluded that any subsequent failure of AGBA to meet contractual requirements would be the fault of AGBA, subjecting it to a legitimate termination of the Contract?86 I believe that to state this question is to answer it.\n\nIn its fair and equitable treatment analysis the Award acknowledges that \"AGBA\u2019s activities were to a large extent affected by the emergency measures that were taken to meet the economic crisis\" and that pesification \"had a dramatic negative impact on the economic prospects of the concession.\" Award \u00b6\u00b6 316, 318. The Award also notes that \"since the new exchange rate... had highly detrimental effects on AGBA, the Province should have offered AGBA a reasonable adjustment of its obligations under the Concession Contract.\" Award \u00b6 325.\n\nAs the PCI J held in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case: \"It is... a principle generally accepted in the jurisprudence of international arbitration, as well as by municipal courts, that one Party cannot avail himself of the fact that the other has not fulfilled some obligation... if the former Party has, by some illegal act, prevented the latter from fulfilling the obligation in question....\" *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Polish Republic),* Claim for Indemnity (Jurisdiction), Judgment of July 26, 1927, PCIJ 1927, Series A, No. 9 \u00b6 87.\n\n**IV. VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND INTEREST**\n------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Award relies on its conclusion that \"AGBA and the Province have a shared responsibility for the failure of the concession\" to hold that it would be \"inappropriate to calculate damages on the basis of customary economic parameters such as a cost or asset based method or an income method.\"87 Moreover, because \"Impregilo has not shown that the concession was likely to have been profitable, if there had been no interference by the Argentine legislator and the Argentine public authorities\" the Award considers \"amounts invested\" as an appropriate measure of Claimant\u2019s damage,88 with the applicable interest rate applied as of the date the Concession Contract was terminated by the Province.89\n\nAward \u00b6 378.\n\nAward \u00b6 380.\n\nAward \u00b6 384.\n\n36.\n\nFor reasons I have set out in the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" and \"Expropriation\" sections above, I cannot endorse the premise of \"shared responsibility\" that underlies the Award\u2019s reasoning. I believe Claimant has marshaled considerable evidence that demonstrates the viability of AGBA even under harsh economic conditions, but for the interference from Argentina. Consequently, the value of the investment should be its \"fair market value\" as determined by using the well-established Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") method, which customarily is applied to ventures that are \"going concerns.\"90\n\nIn the context of expropriation, the World Bank has defined \"going concern\" as \"an enterprise consisting of income-producing assets which has been in operation for a sufficient period of time to generate the data required for the calculation of future income and which could have been expected with reasonable certainty, if the taking had not occurred, to continue producing legitimate income over the course of its economic life in the general circumstances following the taking by the State.\" World Bank, *Report to the Development Committee and Guidelines for the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,* adopted Sept. 21, 1992, *reprintedin* 311.L.M. 1363, 1376 (1992).\n\n37.\n\nWhile it is often employed in expropriation cases,91 the DCF method can also be applied to determine compensation for unfair and inequitable treatment. For example, the *CMS* tribunal held:\n\n[T]he Tribunal is persuaded that the cumulative nature of the breaches discussed here is best dealt with by resorting to the standard of fair market value. While this standard figures prominently in respect of expropriation, it is not excluded that it might also be appropriate for breaches different from expropriation if their effect results in important long-term losses.92\n\n*See, e.g.,* *ADC v. The Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award (Oct 2, 2006), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org.\n\n*CMS Gas Transm 'n Co. v. Republic of Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8 (May 12, 2005) \u00b6 410, *available at* icsid.worldbank.org.\n\n38.\n\nThe case at bar also entails breaches of a \"cumulative\" nature\" that resulted in \"important long term losses\". Since it is undisputed that AGBA operated for the first six out of the projected thirty years of the concession, and was stopped from continuing only by Argentina\u2019s terminating the Concession and transferring all of AGBA\u2019s assets to ABSA, it qualifies as a \"going concern\" and, similar to *CMS,* Claimant\u2019s damages based on the Concession\u2019s \"fair market value\" are properly calculated using the DCF method. Although an enterprise need not be profitable from the beginning to qualify as a going concern,93 it is relevant to the calculation of damages to note that AGBA maintained positive cash flows during its first two years of operation (and even posted a profit during the first year) notwithstanding its mistreatment by Respondent.94 Since the Tribunal enjoys wide discretion to adjust damages depending on the circumstances of the case,95 use of DCF would have allowed, by means of the discount rate, adjustment of the damage figure to account for any business risk that Claimant would have had to absorb as a result of investing in Argentina.96\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Aguas del Aconquija and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (Aug. 20, 2007) \u00b6\u00b6 8.3.3-8.3.4, *available* at http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/VivendiAwardEnglish.pdf.\n\nWalck and Giacchino First Expert Report \u00b6 230. For the remaining four years, during which the effect of Argentina\u2019s inequitable and arbitrary actions became more pronounced, AGBA continued to operate with only minimal losses. *Id.* Based on a discount rate on equity of 15%, which is even more conservative than the *CMS* Tribunal\u2019s 14.5%, Claimant\u2019s experts project AGBA\u2019s net present value to equity of $208,767,000 as of July 2006. *Id.\u00b6* 232. Moreover, Claimant\u2019s experts adapted their assumptions to the circumstances by reducing the estimated collection ratios, increasing the length of time over which collections would occur and delaying AGBA\u2019s reaching the 90 percent collection level until 2009, all as a result of the economic situation. Tellingly, Argentina\u2019s valuation experts adopt the same DCF methodology, with a discount rate of 16.3%, but arrive at a different outcome due to fundamentally different assumptions. *See* Dapena & Coloma Expert Report \u00b6\u00b6 148-50.\n\n*See* *ADC v. The Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award (Oct. 2, 2006) \u00b6 521 (holding that \"at the end of the day, the Tribunal can stand back and look at the [expert reports submitted by the Parties] and arrive at a figure with which it is comfortable in all the circumstances of the case\"), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nRespondent\u2019s valuation experts have attempted to discredit Claimant\u2019s financial projections by referring to the Schroders Report that, among others, assigned negative net present value to the area eventually granted to AGBA. Respondent has failed to mention, however, that its experts have made selective use of the data in the Schroders Report, while the report was never meant as a thorough, well-substantiated business plan, as illustrated by the fact that it assigned negative values to *all* districts in the Province, including one that was bid out successfully for US$ 438 million. *See* Walck and Giacchino Second Expert Report \u00b6\u00b6 402-407.\n\n39.\n\nFinally, given the Award\u2019s reasoning on fair and equitable treatment, I am unable to accept the calculation of the applicable interest rate. According to the Award, \"[t]here is no precise point in time when the unfair treatment took place, but there were a series of successive events - actions as well as omissions - which cumulatively were unfair to AGBA....\"97 Without mentioning what these \"actions\" and \"omissions\" were, the Award observes that \"when the Province terminated the concession, its breaches of the BIT had culminated.\" Thus, the Award applies interest as of the date of the termination decree, namely July 11, 2006.\n\nAward \u00b6 384.\n\n40.\n\nThis holding, however, is in conflict with the basis on which the Award has found that Argentina violated its fair and equitable treatment obligation. Specifically, as explained above, the Award relies on three key facts: the imposition of pesification in January 11 and 28 February 2002; the enactment of the so-called \"New Regulatory Framework\" on June 9, 2003; and Argentina\u2019s refusal to re-negotiate the terms of the Concession Contract after either of these events, despite AGBA\u2019s repeated requests, until Argentina terminated the Concession Contract on July 11, 2006. With liability so based it is conceptually wrong and patently unfair to reward Argentina for its evasive and stalling tactics by calculating interest as of the later date. On the Award\u2019s own liability conclusion Argentina\u2019s acts damaged AGBA in 2002 and in 2003, and Argentina simply refused to do anything about it for at least three years thereafter. The minimum the Award should have done to compensate Claimant for those three \"lost\" years is to include them in its interest calculation.98\n\nThis conclusion is supported further by the Award\u2019s purported reliance on the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case. Award \u00b6 361. In that case, the Permanent Court of International Justice famously held that \"[t]he essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act... is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\" *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany* v. *Polish Republic),* Claim for Indemnity (Merits), Judgment of Sept. 13, 1928, PCIJ 1928, Series A, No. 17, \u00b6 125. In this case, the only way to \"wipe out\" the cost of time and opportunity lost by Claimant due to Argentina\u2019s stalling is to award Claimant interest for the duration of the resulting delays. Incidentally, Argentina\u2019s protracted dilatory tactics after it crippled Claimant\u2019s investment essentially distinguish this case from *Azurix,* which the Award seems to follow in holding that \"there can be no doubt that, by July 11,2006, when the Province terminated the concession, its breaches of the BIT had culminated.\" Award \u00b6 384; *cf.* *Azurix* v. *Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award (July 14, 2006) \u00b6 418 (\"[l]n the Tribunal\u2019s view, there can be no doubt that, by March 12, 2002 when the Province put an end to the Concession, alleging abandonment by ABA, its breaches of the BIT had reached a watershed.\"), *available at* icsid.worldbank.org. Unlike this case, in *Azurix* Argentina terminated the concession relatively soon after its unfair and inequitable treatment of Claimant, so it was appropriate in that case to take the termination date as the starting point for compensation purposes. That approach is inappropriate here, since it would unfairly penalize Claimant for Argentina\u2019s deliberate diffidence and non-responsiveness.\n\n**V. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n41.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I agree that we have jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims. In addition, I concur with my esteemed colleagues that Respondent violated its obligation of fair and equitable treatment, for which violation it must compensate Claimant, though I consider the grounds mentioned in support of that holding to be incomplete. Moreover, I dissent from the Award\u2019s analysis of expropriation, its valuation methodology, and the time period it employs to calculate the interest due Claimant."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 25, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered a Request for arbitration submitted by Impregilo S.p.A., a company incorporated in Italy, against the Argentine Republic. The dispute concerns a concession of water and sewage services under a Concession Contract (hereinafter called the *\"Concession Contract\")* concluded on December 7, 1999 by Aguas del Gran Buenos Aires *(\"AGBA\"),* an Argentine company in which Impregilo had a dominating interest, and the Province of Buenos Aires, and terminated on July 11, 2006 by the Province.\n\n2.\n\nOn August 28, 2007, the Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a U.S. national, as arbitrator. On October 23, 2007, the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a French national, as arbitrator. On May 22, 2008, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge Hans Danelius, a Swedish national, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of May 27, 2008, the Parties were notified by the Centre that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceeding to have begun on that date. The Parties were also notified that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. He was subsequently succeeded in this capacity by Dr. Sergio Puig de la Parra, Counsel, ICSID. Following Dr. Puig de la Parra\u2019s departure from the ICSID Secretariat, Mr. Flores was reappointed as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nA First Session of the Tribunal and the Parties was held via telephone conference call on July 16, 2008. During the Session the Tribunal and the Parties discussed a number of procedural matters, including the schedule for the written pleadings. Alternative timetables were agreed depending on whether or not the Argentine Republic would raise jurisdictional objections. It was also agreed that, even if such objections were raised, there would be no separate Award or Decision on the jurisdictional matters.\n\n5.\n\nOn October 16, 2008, the Claimant, in accordance with the agreed schedule, filed its Memorial on the Merits in which the Claimant alleged that the Respondent had violated the Agreement between Italy and the Argentine Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the *\"Argentina-Italy BIT\")* and international law with respect to the Claimant\u2019s investments and in which the Claimant also requested compensation for damages. On January 16, 2009, the Respondent submitted a Memorial containing objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and to the competence of the Tribunal. On March 16, 2009, the Claimant submitted a Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction.\n\n6.\n\nOn May 4-6, 2009, the Tribunal held a hearing at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on the jurisdictional issues.\n\n7.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits. A Reply on the Merits was submitted by the Claimant on November 2, 2009 and a Rejoinder on the Merits by the Respondent on January 22, 2010.\n\n8.\n\nOn March 9-18, 2010, the Tribunal held a hearing on the merits in Paris. The following people attended the hearing on behalf of Claimant: Mr. R. Doak Bishop, Mr. Craig S. Miles, Mr. Roberto Aguirre Luzi, Prof. Joost Paulwelyn, Ms. Silvia Marchili, Mr. David Weiss, Mr. Louis Alexis Bret, Mr. Esteban Sanchez and Ms. Carol D. Tamez of the law firm of King & Spalding LLP, and Mr. Eduardo Albarracin of Impregilo S.p.A. The following people attended the hearing on behalf of Respondent: Mr. Adolfo Gustavo Scrinzi, Mr. Gabriel Bottini, Mr. Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s, Mr. Ignacio Torterola, Ms. Alejandra Mackluf, Mr. Javier Pargament, Ms. Soledad Romero Caporale, Ms. Mar\u00eda Alejandra Etchegorry, Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Grosse, Mr. Patricio Amedo Barreiro and Ms. Cristina Otegui, of Argentina\u2019s *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n.*\n\n9.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, each Party submitted a chronological summary of the main documents in the case.\n\n10.\n\nCost claims were submitted by the Parties on May 10 and 11, 2010.\n\n11.\n\nA further submission was made by the Claimant on October 11, 2010 to which the Respondent replied on November 19, 2010. The proceedings were closed, in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, on April 15, 2011.\n\n**II. THE INVESTMENT PROTECTION TREATY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Argentina-Italy BIT was signed on May 22, 1990 and entered into force on October 14, 1993. It is drafted in Spanish and Italian and contains, *inter alia,* the following provisions (in translation into English):\n\n**\"ARTICLE 1 Definitions**\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n1. \"Investment\" means, in accordance with the host country laws and irrespective of the selected legal form or any other related laws, any kind of asset invested or reinvested by an individual or a legal entity of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Party, in conformity with the laws and regulations of the latter.\n\nWithin this general framework, it includes, in particular though not exclusively:\n\n\u2026\n\nb) shares of stock, interests or any other form of participation, including minority or indirect interest, in a company established in the territory of each Contracting Party;\n\n\u2026\n\n**ARTICLE 2**\n\n**Promotion and Protection of Investments**\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall promote investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall accept such investments in accordance with its laws.\n\n2. Investments made by investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment. Neither Party shall impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, enjoyment, transformation, cessation or disposal of investments made in its territory by the other Contracting Party\u2019s investors.\n\n**ARTICLE 3**\n\n**National Treatment and Most-Favored Nation Provisions**\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall, within its own territory, accord to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the income and activities related to such investments and to all other matters regulated by this Agreement, a treatment that is no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or investors from third-party countries.\n\n2. The provisions set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to advantages and privileges accorded by either Contracting Party to any third country by virtue of that Party\u2019s binding obligations that derive from its membership in a customs or economic union, common market, or free trade area, or as a result of regional or subregional agreements, multilateral international agreements or double taxation agreements, or any other tax-related arrangements or agreements to facilitate cross border trade.\n\n**ARTICLE 4**\n\n**Damages**\n\nInvestors of one Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, or other similar political economic events shall be accorded, by such other Party in whose territory the investment was made, treatment no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or legal entities or to investors of any third country as regards damages.\n\n**ARTICLE 5**\n\n**Nationalization or Expropriation**\n\n1. (a) Neither Contracting Party may adopt any measure that restricts, whether for a definite or indefinite period of time, the right to property, possession, control or enjoyment in relation to the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, except upon specific provisions laid down by law, judgments, or decisions rendered by a competent court and other general non-discriminatory provisions intended to regulate economic activities.\n\n(b) Investments by investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be nationalized, expropriated, seized or otherwise appropriated, either directly or indirectly, through measures having an equivalent effect in the territory of the other Party, unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n- the measures are for a public purpose, of national interest or security;\n\n- they are taken in accordance with due process of law;\n\n- they are non-discriminatory or contrary to the commitments undertaken;\n\n- they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n(c) The compensation shall be equivalent to the actual market value of the investment immediately before the expropriation or nationalization decision was announced or became public and shall be determined in accordance with internationally accepted technical standards. Where the market value cannot be readily ascertained, the compensation shall be determined based on a fair assessment of the constituent and distinctive elements of the company as well as the components and results of the business activities involved.\n\nThe compensation shall include interest accrued until the date of payment at a normal commercial rate of interest. In the event an agreement is not reached between the investor and the Contracting Party that has taken such measure, the compensation shall be determined in accordance with the dispute settlement procedures set out in Article 8 hereof. Once it is determined, the compensation shall be paid without delay in the currency in which the investment was made or in a freely convertible currency accepted by the investor, and its repatriation shall be authorized.\n\n2. The provisions laid out in paragraph 1 hereof shall also apply to the returns from an investment as well as, in the event of liquidation, the proceeds thereof.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Article 8**\n\n**Settlement of Disputes between Investors and Contracting Parties**\n\n1. Any dispute regarding an investment between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall, to the extent possible, be settled through friendly consultation between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, it may be submitted to the competent judicial or administrative courts of the Party in whose territory the investment is made.\n\n3. Where, after eighteen months from the date of notice of commencement of proceedings before the courts mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the dispute between an investor and one of the Contracting Parties has not been resolved, it may be referred to international arbitration.\n\n4. From the time arbitration proceedings are commenced, each party to the dispute shall take any such measures as may be necessary to dismiss any pending court proceedings.\n\n5. Where the dispute is submitted to international arbitration, the investor may choose to refer the dispute either to:\n\na) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature in Washington on March 18, 1985, provided that each Party to this Agreement is a signatory State to such Convention. Where such condition is not met, each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the ICSID Additional Facility Rules regarding conciliation and arbitration, or\n\nb) An *ad hoc* arbitration tribunal is established for each particular case. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) contained in Resolution No. 31/98 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 15, 1976. The panel shall consist of three arbitrators. If the arbitrators are not nationals of the Contracting Parties, they shall be nationals of States having diplomatic relations with them.\n\n6. Neither Contracting Party shall, at any stage of the arbitral proceedings or the enforcement of the arbitral award, assert, as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the investor concerned has received, pursuant to an insurance policy or guarantee contract as indicated in Article 7 hereof, indemnification or compensation for all or part of any alleged loss.\n\n7. The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on conflict of laws -, the provisions of this Agreement, the terms of any possible specific agreement concluded in relation to the investment as well as with the applicable principles of international law.\n\n8. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to comply with any such award in accordance with its domestic laws and the relevant international conventions in force for both Contracting Parties.\n\n9. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from pursuing, through diplomatic channels, any matter related to any pending court proceedings or the arbitration until the relevant proceedings have been concluded, unless either party to the dispute has failed to comply with the arbitral award or court decision, in accordance with the terms of compliance set forth in such award or decision.\n\n**ARTICLE 10 Application of other Rules**\n\n1. Where a particular matter is governed by this Agreement as well as by another International Agreement between both Contracting Parties or by International Law, such provisions or rules shall, to the extent they are more favorable, prevail over this Agreement.\n\n2. If, under any law, regulation, provision, or specific contract, either Contracting Party has adopted rules entitling investors of the other Contracting Party to a more favorable treatment than that provided for by this Agreement, such rules shall prevail over the provisions of this Agreement.\"\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIn the 1990s, water and sewerage services in the Province of Buenos Aires were provided by the public utility *Administraci\u00f3n General de Obras Sanitarias de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (\"AGOSBA \").* In 1996, the Province decided to privatize these services and adopted for this purpose Law No. 11,820 (the *\"Regulatory Framework\"')* and set up as regulator the *Organismo Regulador de Aguas Bonaerense (\"ORAB\").* It also organized a bidding process for the concessions to be issued for the various parts of the Province.\n\n14.\n\nImpregilo formed a consortium with other international companies (Sideco Americana S.A. and Aguas de Bilbao Bizkaia), and, by Provincial Decree No. 2907/99 of October 18, 1999, was awarded one of the concession areas into which the Province\u2019s territory had been divided. Pursuant to the bidding rules, Impregilo and its partners incorporated and funded AGBA, an Argentine company. On December 7, 1999, the Province and AGBA executed the Concession Contract to provide water and sewerage services in an area covering seven municipalities.\n\n15.\n\nThe Concession Contract contained, *inter alia,* the following clauses (in translation into English):\n\n**1.4 PURPOSE OF THE CONVENTION**\n\nThe purpose of the Concession is to perform, within the Concession Area, the following activities: collection, treatment, transportation, distribution and commercialization of Drinking Water, collection, treatment, disposal and potential reuse or commercialization of Sewage, including Industrial Sewage, pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 3.14. In all cases, the Service shall include maintenance, project design, construction, rehabilitation and expansion of all works required for service provision.\n\n\u2026\n\n**1.6 EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS. NON INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS WITHIN THE CONCESSION AREA**\n\nThe Concessionaire shall enjoy an exclusive right to provide the Service within the Concession Area, subject to the Regulatory Framework and the provisions of Article 5.6 and the remaining provisions hereof.\n\n\u2026\n\n**1.7 TERM**\n\nThe term of the Concession shall be thirty (30) years from Takeover.\n\n\u2026\n\n**1.8 CONDITIONS OF THE CONCESSION**\n\nThe Concession is granted in consideration of the payment by the Concessionaire of an initial canon of US$ 1,260,000 (one million two hundred and sixty thousand United States Dollars). Such amount was effectively paid by the Concessionaire to the Province at the time of execution of the Contract, and is equal to the price offered by the Successful Bidder in the Bidding Process for the Concession Area. Without prejudice to that, the Concessionaire undertakes to make all the investments required to implement the POES,1 as described in Annex F, and guarantee the adequate protection of the Service subject to the terms of the Contract, provided that the tariff adjustments established in Annex \u00d1 shall be conditioned upon the fulfillment of such undertaking.\n\n**1.9 REGULATORY AGENCY**\n\nThe Concessionaire, the Service and any other aspect related to the performance of the Contract shall be subject to the control and regulation of the Regulatory Agency.\n\n**1.10 APPLICABLE LAWS**\n\nThe Concession shall be governed by the laws and regulations listed below, in the following order of prevalence:\n\n1.10.1 The Regulatory Framework\n\n1.10.2 The Terms of Reference\n\n1.10.3 The Bid\n\n1.10.4 The Contract and the Decree approving such Contract\n\n1.10.5 The rules and regulations issued by the Regulatory Agency. Any regulations currently applicable to the Service shall continue to apply, except where they are in conflict with the rest of the rules and regulations listed above.\n\n\u2026\n\n**3.2 RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE CONCESSIONAIRE**\n\nIn connection with Service provision, the Concessionaire shall have the rights and duties established in the Regulatory Framework, this Contract and any regulations established from time to time by the Regulatory Agency. Especially, the Concessionaire shall perform all tasks related to Service provision required under the applicable laws to guarantee effective supply to Users, the protection of public health and the rational use of resources. The Service shall be supplied subject to the principles of continuity, regularity, quality and generality.\n\n**3.3 SERVICE COVERAGE**\n\nThe Drinking Water Supply through Connections to the Mains shall be expanded to guarantee availability to all persons residing in urban areas within the Concession Area, pursuant to the POES and Five-Year Plans. The Concessionaire must efficiently meet the demand for Drinking Water, by providing a Service compliant with the quality standards established in the Regulatory Framework and the Contract.\n\nIn turn, the Sewage Service through Connections to the Mains shall be expanded to all urban population to fulfill the goals established in the POES and Five-Year Plans. The Concessionaire must ensure the adequate capacity of the facilities allocated to the collection and transportation of liquid waste so as to effectively meet Service demand and guarantee the proper operation of the systems.\n\nThe areas eligible as urban areas shall be determined pursuant to Law 8912.\n\n**3.4 DUTY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE**\n\nThe Concessionaire shall maintain and renew all civil and electromechanical facilities and shall expand, renew and/or recondition the external networks for the distribution of Drinking Water and Sewage in such a way as to guarantee regular Service supply to all premises within the Service Area and Expansion Area, pursuant to the provisions of the POES and Five-Year Plans.\n\n\u2026\n\n**3.5 DUTY TO CONNECT AND PAY THE SERVICE**\n\nOwners, owners\u2019 associations created pursuant to Law 13,512, persons in possession of or using real property located in urban areas within the Service Area shall be under a duty to connect to the network by paying the applicable fee for Connection to the Mains to the Concessionaire. Moreover, they shall be under a duty to connect and install, at their own cost and expense, residential Water and Sewage services and maintain said facilities in good condition.\n\nIn turn, owners, owners\u2019 associations, usufruct holders, and persons in possession or use of real property located in an area serviced by a Drinking Water distribution main or a Sewage main shall be under a duty to pay the Service pursuant to the applicable Tariff Regime even if the property has no connection to external Service networks. Nonetheless, this provision shall not apply to vacant properties if there has been a request for non-connection or Service disconnection, which shall be subject to the charges established in the Tariff Regime for those special cases.\n\n\u2026\n\n**5 SERVICE EXPANSION AND OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM (POES)**\n\n**5.1 CONCEPT**\n\nThe POES to be performed by the Concessionaire during the Concession is included in Annex F and covers Service expansion, Service goals and action plans, the works required to attain quantitative, qualitative and Service efficiency goals and commitments, and to comply with the requirements regarding geographic coverage to be fulfilled and performed by the Concessionaire pursuant to the terms established therein, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Regulatory Framework and the Contract.\n\nThe POES consists of six (6) consecutive Five-Year Plans, pursuant to Article 5.3. Moreover, it includes updates, adjustments, and changes incorporated through the POES progress annual report established in Article 6.5 upon approval by the Regulatory Agency.\n\nFailure to comply with the POES shall be considered a serious fault, pursuant to Article 13.2.5.5.\n\n**5.2 PURPOSE**\n\nThe purpose of the POES is to promote expansion in the Concession Area and to guarantee maintenance and improvement of the systems required for Service provision, enabling efficient administration and operation in such a way as to fulfill Service Standards and the obligations established in the Regulatory Framework and the Contract.\n\n**5.3 FIVE-YEAR PLANS**\n\nFor each of the five-year periods covered by the term of the POES, the Concessionaire shall present to the Regulatory Agency draft Five-Year Plans explaining, adjusting and providing the necessary updates to fulfill the coverage goals and Service goals established in the POES, with indication of the districts where the POES is to be executed.\n\nThe project for the first Five-Year Plan shall be submitted within three (3) months since Contract execution. The draft for each subsequent Five-Year Plan must be presented at least one year in advance of the end date of the applicable five-year period. The Regulatory Agency must request any changes and clarification deemed necessary. Upon approval of the draft presented by the Concessionaire, it shall become a Five-Year Plan and shall become an integral part of the POES, and its fulfillment shall be mandatory. The drafts submitted by the Concessionaire shall be certified by Auditors.\n\n\u2026\n\n**12.1 TARIFF REGIME**\n\nThe Tariff Regime applicable to the Service provision is attached hereto as Annex \u00d1.\n\n12.1.1 TARIFFS\n\nThe calculation of applicable tariffs pursuant to Article 28.11 of Law 11,820 shall be based on the general principle that tariffs shall cover all operating expenses, maintenance expenses and service amortization and provide a reasonable return on the Concessionaire\u2019s investment subject to efficient management and operation by the Concessionaire and strict compliance with the applicable service quality and expansion goals.\n\n**12.2 TARIFFS AND PRICES**\n\nTariffs and prices applied to Service provision after Takeover arise from the application of the provisions established in the Tariff Regime.\n\n**12.3 ADJUSTMENT OF TARIFFS AND PRICES**\n\n12.3.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions established in the Tariff Regime, Service tariffs and prices shall remain in force throughout the term of the Concession unless modified pursuant to the review procedures established in this section.\n\n\u2026\n\n12.3.4 ORDINARY FIVE-YEAR REVIEWS\n\nOrdinary reviews shall be the reviews carried out every five years due to changes in the goals established in the POES based on the Five-Year Plan applicable to the second five-year term.\n\n\u2026\n\n12.3.5 EXTRAORDINARY REVIEWS DUE TO CHANGES IN COST INDICES\n\n12.3.5.1 Concept\n\nThese are extraordinary reviews that may be carried out when the Concessionaire or the Regulatory Agency claims an increase in the cost indices associated to the Concession in excess of three percent (3%) in absolute value terms, pursuant to the provisions established in Article 23.3.5.2.\n\nThe Concessionaire cannot request an extraordinary review due to modifications in cost indices until twelve (12) months have elapsed since the last review; the foregoing notwithstanding, the accumulated change in cost indices shall be taken into consideration at the time of calculating the applicable tariff review.\n\n\u2026\n\n**12.4 CHANGES TO THE TARIFF REGIME**\n\n12.4.1 General Principles\n\nThe Tariff Regime may be modified once the third year of the Concession has concluded.\n\n\u2026\n\n12.4.2 Grounds for Adjustment at the Request of the Concessionaire\n\nThe Tariff Regime may only be modified at the request of the Concessionaire if the Concessionaire proves that:\n\na) it has been impossible to balance service supply and demand due to reasons attributable to the current Tariff Regime in spite of taking all necessary steps for that purpose and having operated efficiently,\n\nb) the Tariff Regime in force does not promote rational use of the assets and resources applied to Service provision or is unsuited to attain the sanitary goals directly related to Service provision,\n\nc) a modification of the Tariff regime in force will result in a significant reduction of operating expenses with the resulting benefits to Users.\n\n**13. DUTIES AND SANCTIONS**\n\n**13.1 DUTIES OF THE CONCESSIONAIRE**\n\nThe Concessionaire assumes the responsibility for the Concession and all legal, technical, economic and financial risks associated thereto, and shall be liable to the Province, Users and third parties for the fulfillment of the duties and requirements necessary to provide the Service as from Takeover. Under no circumstances will the Province, the granting authority, the Regulatory Agency or OSBA2 be liable to Users or third parties in connection with the duties assumed by the Concessionaire.\n\n\u2026\n\n**13.2 SANCTIONS**\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions established in Chapter 14, if the Concessionaire fails to fulfill its duties it shall be subject to the following sanctions: warning, fine and provisional state takeover pursuant to the following terms and conditions.\n\n\u2026\n\n13.2.5.5 Delays in the POES\n\nAny delay in fulfilling the POES shall be sanctioned pursuant to the provisions below:\n\na) A fine in the amount of one hundred thousand US Dollars (US$ 100,000) shall be applied for\n\nnon-essential delays in fulfilling an approved Service goal or completing a work committed...\n\nb) A fine in the amount of one million US Dollars (US$ 1,000,000)...shall be applied for\n\nessential delays in fulfilling an approved Service goal or completing a work committed....\n\n\u2026\n\n**14 TERMINATION OF THE CONCESSION**\n\n**14.1 GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION**\n\nThe Concession shall terminate upon expiration of the term, upon the occurrence of an act of God or ***force majeure,*** due to the Concessionaire\u2019s or the Granting Authority\u2019s fault, and repossession of the Service by the Granting Authority.\n\n\u2026\n\n14.1.3 TERMINATION DUE TO THE CONCESSIONAIRE\u2019S FAULT\n\nThe Granting Authority may terminate the Contract due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault on the following grounds:\n\na) Serious non-compliance with legal, contractual or regulatory provisions applicable to the Service.\n\nb) Repeated and unjustified delays in fulfilling the coverage goals set forth in the POES.\n\n\u2026\n\nh) Repeated violation of the User regulations provided for in Article 13-II of the Regulatory Framework.\n\ni) Repeatedly withholding or concealing information from the Regulatory Agency.\n\n\u2026\n\nk) Failure to furnish, renew or refurnish the Contract guaranty as provided for in Article 11.1, and the Operator guaranty provided for in Article 11.2.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf any non-compliance or violation can be cured, the Regulatory Agency shall demand that the Concessionaire correct its actions, cure the breach in any suitable way and submit the relevant response, in the period fixed according to the circumstances of the situation, the nature of the violation and in view of the public interest, which shall never be shorter than thirty (30) days. Upon expiration of the period accorded to the Concessionaire, the Regulatory Agency shall give notice to the Granting Authority of the subsistence of the non-compliance or breach if it has been duly proved, and the Granting Authority may terminate the Contract due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Regulatory Authority shall take part in the termination proceedings, and shall submit its justified conclusions to the Granting Authority.\n\n**16.7 JURISDICTION**\n\nAny dispute arising between the Granting Authority and the Concessionaire related to the interpretation and performance of the Contract shall be resolved by the administrative courts of competent jurisdiction in and for the city of La Plata, and such parties waive any other applicable jurisdiction or venue.\"\n\nThe POES (Service Optimization and Expansion Program) establishes the quantitative and qualitative goals to be attained by the Concessionaire and includes the Five-Year Plans pursuant to Chapter 5 and in Annex F.\n\nThe OSBA is equivalent to the AGOSBA.\n\n16.\n\nAnnex F to the Concession Contract contains details about the Service Expansion and Optimization Program (the *\"POES\")* mentioned in Article 5 of the Concession Contract.\n\n17.\n\nArticle 1 of Annex F, which concerns \"Managements Indexes\", specifies the goals related to Service quality and business management permitting values to be accomplished within the time frames in Table 1 in the Annex - minimum values for micro-metering efficiency (from 75% in year 3 to 98% in year 30), maximum values for water not accounted for (from 40% in year 3 to 25% in year 30) and minimum values for Service continuity (from 96% in year 3 to 100% in year 30).\n\n18.\n\nArticle 2 of the Annex indicates goals for the Service expansion in respect of drinking water and sewerage (minimum number of new connections per year), the installation of individual metering devices for water and the revamping and/or reconditioning of pipes.\n\n19.\n\nAnnex \u00d1 concerns the Tariff System applicable to the Concessionaire\u2019s provision of the Service. It defines in Article 2 the persons obliged to pay for the Service and in Article 4 the tariffs applicable to Non-metered and Metered Service. Article 10 deals with the work fees to be paid by the users when the public service for the drinking water supply and sewage services is connected. Article 19 provides that the Concessionaire shall have the right to bill and collect all of the Services it provides. Article 29 deals with Service interruption in cases where users are late in paying their bills. Article 20 deals with Billing Currency and provides as follows:\n\n\"Tariffs are stated in US Dollars; however, users shall receive bills stated in pesos. The applicable conversion shall be performed on the basis of the 1 Dollar = 1 Peso parity established in the Convertibility Law or any other exchange rate from time to time established by law to replace such parity in force at bill cut-off date.\"\n\n20.\n\nOn January 3, 2000, AGBA took possession of the concession, and on March 21, 2000, AGBA presented its first Five-Year Plan to ORAB. On July 21, 2000, ORAB requested amendments to the Five-Year Plan, and on November 8, 2000, AGBA acquiesced by presenting a revised Five-Year Plan. The revised Plan was approved by ORAB on January 31, 2001.\n\n21.\n\nIn a letter of May 17, 2001 to the Minister of Public Works and Services of the Province of Buenos Aires, AGBA stated that, despite AGBA\u2019s efforts, there were considerable difficulties in receiving payment for its services from customers. The non-collection rates within the Concession Area had reached spectral figures of around 60%, and this had affected AGBA\u2019s capacity to make the investments required under the expansion program. Consequently, AGBA was facing a significant alteration of the economic and financial equilibrium of the concession and was experiencing considerable difficulties in obtaining bank loans. As a result, it had also been impossible to achieve the goals of the current Five-Year Plan. By way of conclusion, AGBA requested that a work commission be created in order to jointly analyze appropriate solutions and alternatives and that, as a provisional measure, the expansion goals be temporarily suspended until the said commission had made a decision.\n\n22.\n\nOn May 30, 2001, the Undersecretary of Public Services of the Province of Buenos Aires replied that the issue of non-collection rates was a business risk which AGBA had to bear in accordance with the terms of the Concession Contract. Nevertheless, the Ministry agreed to set up a working commission whose work could lead to contractual modifications that would harmonize the objectives of the Regulatory Framework and the Concession Contract with the interests of the users in the relevant area.\n\n23.\n\nIn a letter of July 17, 2001, AGBA, with reference to the severe economic crisis in Argentina, asked ORAB to suspend temporarily the execution of the POES. The request was repeated in a letter of August 15, 2001.\n\n24.\n\nOn August 7, 2001, ORAB requested that AGBA should refrain in certain areas from billing work charges on the basis of Article 10 of Annex \u00d1 to the Concession Contract.\n\n25.\n\nOn August 27, 2001, ORAB\u2019s Technical Department found that AGBA\u2019s performance during the first year of the concession had shown an acceptable degree of compliance with the POES. The Technical Department also supported the request for a suspension of the POES in view of the economic hardship facing the province and the country. A favorable opinion was also expressed by ORAB\u2019s Economic Regulation Department on November 23, 2001 and by ORAB\u2019s Law and Resolution Department on December 3, 2001.\n\n26.\n\nIn a letter of September 13, 2001, AGBA asked the Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires to intervene and arrange a meeting to discuss the serious situation that had arisen in regard to the implementation of the Concession Contract. On December 27, 2001, AGBA asked the Province Governor to arrange immediately bilateral negotiations in order to decide on the most suitable mechanisms to restore the equilibrium of the economic and financial equation of the Concession Contract, which had been disrupted by various events.\n\n27.\n\nIn an internal letter of October 10, 2001, ORAB\u2019s Technical Department noted that, despite AGBA\u2019s efforts, neither the goals set forth in the Concession Contract nor those specified in the POES had been attained. In view hereof, ORAB decided, on October 17, 2001, not to allow AGBA to increase tariffs according to a coefficient indicated in Annex \u00d1 to the Concession Contract.\n\n28.\n\nOn January 6, 2002, the Federal Argentine Government enacted Law No. 25,561 on Public Emergency and Exchange Regime Reform in which utilities contracts were \"pesified\" at parity level and tariffs were frozen. The Government was also authorized to renegotiate public utilities contracts.\n\n29.\n\nIn a letter of January 9, 2002 to the Province Governor, AGBA pointed out that the latest economic and social developments had further worsened AGBA\u2019s situation. AGBA requested a meeting at which AGBA could apprise the Governor of the many factors that were putting the concession on the brink of collapse.\n\n30.\n\nOn January 11, 2002, ORAB \"pesified\" AGBA\u2019s tariffs at parity rate. On January 24, 2002, AGBA demanded the reversal of this decision as being contrary not only to the Concession Contract but also to the law and the Argentine Constitution.\n\n31.\n\nOn February 18, 2002, ORAB issued Resolution No. 14/02 which prevented AGBA from billing work charges.\n\n32.\n\nOn February 19, 2002, AGBA requested the renegotiation of the Concession Contract. The request was repeated in a letter of April 17, 2002 to the Province Governor.\n\n33.\n\nOn February 28, 2002, Law No. 12,858 was enacted by the Province. According to this law, the Executive was authorized to create a New Regulatory Framework for water services.\n\n34.\n\nBy Decree 517/02 of March 13, 2002, the Province approved the statutes of the company Aguas Bonaerenses S.A. *(\"ABSA\"),* which was to take over a concession for other areas in the Province of Buenos Aires, which had until then been held by the company Azurix.\n\n35.\n\nBy Decree No. 1175/02 of May 13, 2002, the Province set up a Special Commission for the Evaluation of the Impact of the Crisis on the Tariffs and Contracts of Public Service. The task of the Special Commission was to examine the problems in the area of public utilities and to propose solutions.\n\n36.\n\nIn a letter of June 11, 2002 to ORAB, AGBA referred to changes in tax laws which had created further difficulties for AGBA and asked for a review of the Concession Contract. The need for a renegotiation of the Concession Contract was further explained in AGBA\u2019s letter of June 28, 2002 to the Province Governor.\n\n37.\n\nOn July 23, 2002, the Undersecretary of Public Services of the Province, in a letter to ORAB, pointed out that AGBA had undertaken by contract to fulfill the obligations in the POES and obtain itself the necessary funds for this purpose. The Undersecretary did not find it reasonable to make adjustments in favor of AGBA as this would have negative effects for the customers whose economic interests required protection.\n\n38.\n\nIn a letter of August 14, 2002 to the Undersecretary, AGBA referred to a meeting in his office that had taken place on August 2, 2002, and again emphasized the need for contract renegotiation. AGBA repeated its request for renegotiation in letters of September 30 and October, 24, 2002 to the Province Governor, and also in a letter of October 8, 2002 to the President of the Commission for the Evaluation of the Impact of the Crisis on the Tariffs and Contracts of Public Service as well as in a letter of October 30, 2002 to ORAB.\n\n39.\n\nOn August 27, 2002, ORAB, in Resolution No. 56/02, suspended AGBA\u2019s right to interrupt water service to customers who had not paid their bills.\n\n40.\n\nIn a report of December 2, 2002 to the President of ORAB, the Technical Department of ORAB found that AGBA had essentially satisfied the goals established for the first concession year 2000. In Resolution No. 69/02 of December 5, 2002, ORAB resolved that AGBA had met the service expansion and quality goals of the first year of the concession (year 2000), as provided in Annex F to the Concession Contract and incorporated into the first Five-Year Plan which was an integral part of the POES.\n\n41.\n\nOn December 30, 2002, in Resolution No. 77/02, ORAB also granted AGBA\u2019s request for a suspension of the POES obligations in the second concession year 2002 with the effect that measures which had not been accomplished during that year should not lead to penalties according to Article 13.2.5.5 of the Concession Contract.\n\n42.\n\nOn June 9, 2003, the Province issued Decree No. 878/03 which contained a New Regulatory Framework for the Provision of the Drinking Water and Wastewater Public Services in the Province. According to the Decree, the Control Agency would be the *Organismo de Control del Agua de Buenos Aires (\"OCABA\").* On July 17, 2003, AGBA challenged the Decree. AGBA also repeatedly - on August 27, September 22 and December 2, 2003 and on January 13, 2004 - asked for renegotiation of the Concession Contract. On June 30, 2004, the Province Governor rejected AGBA\u2019s request for revocation of the Decree issuing the New Regulatory Framework.\n\n43.\n\nOn April 26, 2005, the Province adopted Decree No. 757/05 in which an Agreement with ABSA was approved. ABSA was permitted to make gradual increases of tariffs and was granted certain subsidies. In its letter of July 15, 2005 to the competent Minister and Undersecretary, AGBA argued that AGBA was discriminated against in comparison with ABSA and demanded similar treatment.\n\n44.\n\nA request by AGBA to be allowed to make tariff increases was rejected in a letter from the Undersecretary of Public Services on August 25, 2005.\n\n45.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, Resolution No. 84/06 was adopted by which the Ministry of Public Services ordered OCABA to gather information about AGBA\u2019s performance as concession holder. OCABA issued its report on April 21, 2006 in which it concluded that AGBA had violated in several ways its obligations under the Concession Contract and the POES.\n\n46.\n\nIn a letter of June 14, 2006 to the Minister and the Undersecretary of Public Services and also to the President of ORAB, AGBA accused the Province of violating its obligations under the Concession Contract and declared that, unless this was corrected within 45 days, AGBA would find it necessary to rescind the Concession Contract.\n\n47.\n\nOn July 10, 2006, OCABA, in Resolution No. 36/06, fined AGBA for having failed to handle certain complaints in a timely fashion.\n\n48.\n\nFinally, on July 11, 2006, the Province Governor, by Decree No. 1666/06, terminated the Concession Agreement due to AGBA\u2019s fault pursuant to Article 14.1.3 (a), (b), (h), (i) and (k) of the Concession Contract. By Decree No. 1677/06, the Province Governor, on July 13, 2006, transferred AGBA\u2019s water and sewage service concession to ABSA.\n\n**IV. ISSUES OF JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Argentine Republic requests the Arbitral Tribunal to issue an award finding under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) the lack of jurisdiction of ICSID and the lack of competence of the Tribunal to hear the case:\n\n(a) the lack of jurisdiction of ICSID and the lack of competence of the Tribunal since Impregilo failed to meet the requirements established in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT;\n\n(b) in the alternative, the lack of jurisdiction of ICSID and the lack of competence of the Tribunal since Impregilo\u2019s claim is an indirect claim;\n\n(c) in the alternative, the lack of jurisdiction of ICSID and the lack of competence of the Tribunal since the claim refers to contractual issues on which the ICSID has no jurisdiction; and\n\nThe Argentine Republic also requests that Impregilo must pay all the court expenses and professional fees that Argentina will have incurred under Arbitration Rule 47(1) j.\n\n50.\n\nImpregilo requests:\n\n(a) a declaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal, and\n\n(b) an order dismissing all of Argentina\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n**A. First objection: Impregilo has not complied with the requirements set forth in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT** ***The Argentine Republic:***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe dispute resolution clause contained in Article 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT requires investors to submit their dispute to domestic courts for 18 months before filing international arbitration proceedings. The use of the permissive verb \"may\" *(\"podr\u00e1\"* in Spanish and *\"potr\u00e1\"* in Italian) indicates that an investor is not required to submit the dispute to a binding resolution system but may continue with the amicable consultations for as long as he wishes or even leave the dispute dormant for an indefinite term. It does not mean, however, that the investor, if he wishes to initiate international arbitration proceedings, is exempted from first submitting the dispute to domestic courts and from then waiting for 18 months before proceeding to international arbitration.\n\n52.\n\nIn fact, if amicable negotiations fail, then, pursuant to Article 8(3), an investor may submit the dispute to international arbitration only if it was previously submitted to the jurisdiction of the competent administrative or judicial bodies for at least 18 months. A different interpretation would deprive the first half of Article 8(3) of any purpose and effect, in violation of the canons of treaty interpretation of *effet utile* (useful effect) or *ut res magis valeat quam pereat* (the matter must have effect rather than not).\n\n53.\n\nAs Impregilo failed to meet the requirement contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of the competent administrative or judicial bodies of the Argentine Republic for 18 months before filing the arbitration proceedings, this claim must be rejected. The awards rendered by the tribunals in the ICSID cases *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic3* and *TSA v. Argentine Republic*4 support the Argentine Republic\u2019s position in this regard.\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14 *(\"Wintershall\"),*  Award, Dec. 8, 2008, paras. 114-22.\n\n*TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5 (\"*TSA*\"), Award, Dec. 19, 2008, paras. 98, 107 and 110-12.\n\n54.\n\nIn fact, Impregilo did not submit the dispute to the \"competent administrative or judicial bodies\" and can therefore in no case be deemed to have fulfilled the condition in Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT with respect to its consent to international arbitration.\n\n55.\n\nMoreover, Impregilo cannot rely upon the most-favored-nation *(\"MFN\")* clause in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT for the purpose of avoiding the obligation to resort to the local courts for 18 months. This clause cannot be used to circumvent the obligation to resort to the competent administrative or judicial bodies for 18 months. There are at least four arguments for rejecting the position that Article VII of the Argentina-US BIT should be imported into the Argentina-Italy BIT by application of the MFN clause: (i) it does not give proper effect to the terms of the MFN clause; (ii) the MFN clause refers to treatment \"in the territory\", whereas arbitration takes place outside Argentina and beyond its sovereign powers; (iii) resorting to domestic courts cannot be deemed as unfavorable for investors; and (iv) the 18-month clause is an essential clause of the BIT and, therefore, Impregilo cannot invoke the MFN clause in order not to abide by it.\n\n56.\n\nThe subjects of the MFN clause, contained in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, are \"investments made by the investors of the other Contracting Party, income and activities related to such investments and all other matters regulated by this Agreement\". There are two specific items listed - \"investments\" and \"income and activities related to such investments\" - followed, in the same clause without separation by a comma, by a third general term: \"all other matters regulated by this Agreement\". Under the *ejusdem generis* principle, the general term applies only to the subject-matter of the specific items, *i.e.* investments. Thus, when the MFN clause requires \"a treatment that is no less favorable\" for \"all other matters regulated by this Agreement\", it is referring to matters related to investments. Arbitration and its preconditions under Article 8, including the 18-month judicial recourse requirement, do not concern investments, but instead a dispute settlement procedure under the BIT. Moreover, ICSID arbitration is not \"a treatment\" which Argentina affords the investor, but instead a procedure to which Argentina is subjected on the initiative of the investor. Accordingly, the MFN clause does not apply to Article 8.\n\n57.\n\nThe *effet utile* principle provides the basis for such conclusion. If the final, general term of the MFN clause, \"all other matters\", encompassed everything mentioned in the BIT, including Article 8, it would render the first two specific terms meaningless -the BIT could have stated only the final, general term and it would have had the same meaning.\n\n58.\n\nFurthermore, while precedents interpreting whether an MFN clause applies to a dispute settlement clause are divided, the awards universally agree that, under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, each case depends on the exact language and context of the MFN clause at issue.\n\n59.\n\nThe MFN clause is also limited in its territorial application. Each State is only required to accord no less favorable treatment \"within its own territory\" *(\"en el \u00e1mbito de su territorio\"* in Spanish; *\"nel proprio territorio\"* in Italian). It does not require most favorable treatment outside the State\u2019s territory. Under the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Argentine Republic\u2019s territory is defined physically and is considered to include its \"land and ocean boundaries\" and \"maritime zones\". This territorial limitation excludes the conditions for participation in an ICSID arbitration from the scope of the MFN clause, because ICSID is genuinely transnational arbitration that is governed by a multilateral treaty and is totally detached from any national jurisdiction, whether of ICSID\u2019s seat or of the location where the arbitration is conducted, much less that of the respondent State. Accordingly, there is no basis for invoking the MFN clause with respect to the conditions for recourse to an international arbitration, including the 18-month local judicial recourse prerequisite to that international arbitration under Article 8.\n\n60.\n\nFinally, Article 3(1) requires host States to accord \"a treatment that is no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or investors from third-party countries\". Even if the Tribunal were to apply the MFN clause to Article 8 (which it should not), in order to make use of the dispute resolution provisions of the Argentina-US BIT, Impregilo has the burden of establishing that it provides \"more favorable\" treatment than the Argentina-Italy BIT. However, Impregilo has not done so, nor will it be able to do so.\n\n61.\n\nImpregilo was not prevented by any obstacle from filing judicial claims. Impregilo does not - nor could it - maintain that it was deprived of the right of access to the courts or of the guarantees of due process. This is evidenced by the various decisions rendered by the Argentine courts in less than 18 months, many of which are final. Measures such as the ones at issue in this case may be, and have been, analyzed by the Argentine courts and, in many cases, decisions on the merits have been issued within less than a year. This proves that there are resources in the Argentine Republic for the judiciary to pass decisions swiftly.\n\n62.\n\nArticle 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT articulates a multi-layered, sequential dispute settlement mechanism ultimately leading, if still needed, to a limited consent to arbitration by both sovereigns. The Parties designed and negotiated this process as a whole, and obviously thought the provisions had a meaning. Impregilo should not be allowed to re-assemble the negotiated \"package\" by picking and choosing bits and pieces from the dozens of BITs that Argentina has entered into.\n\n63.\n\nThe purpose of such 18-month clauses is to give States the possibility of settling the dispute through their courts and potentially solving any violation of international law. This is the reason why this requirement has been specially negotiated by Argentina with certain States and why capital-exporting States even have similar clauses with longer terms.\n\n64.\n\nImpregilo may not avoid the provisions of Article 8(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT by invoking the MFN clause, given that the 18-month clause was specially negotiated, not only with Italy, but also with all other States in whose BITs such clauses were included. This clause is not present in all BITs entered into by Argentina, which evidences that the States negotiating the treaty intended to include it as a special, binding provision just as the rest of the provisions in those instruments. The fact that, after entering into treaties not including an 18-month clause, Argentina in certain cases continued to sign treaties with 18-month clauses is proof of this.\n\n65.\n\nReference may also be made to the analysis in the *Vladimir Berschader v. Russian Federation5* case regarding the phrase \"all matters relating to\" contained in many BITs and similar to the phrase \"all other matters regulated by this Agreement\" contained in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy Treaty. The awards in the ICSID cases *Salini,6 Plama7 Telenor*8 and *Wintershall9* also support the Argentine Republic's position on this issue.\n\n*Vladimir Berschader and Moise Berschader* v. *Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. 080/2004 *(\"Berschader\")* Award, April 21,2006, paras. 183-208.\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrade S.p.A.* v. *The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13 (*\"Salini*\"), Decision on Jurisdiction, Nov. 9, 2004, paras. 116-19.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited* v. *The Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 *(\"Plama\"),* Decision on Jurisdiction, Feb. 8, 2005, paras. 183-227.\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications AS* v`. *Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15 *(\"Telenor\"),* Award, Sept. 13,2006, paras. 83-101.\n\n*Wintershall, supra* n. 3, paras. 161-68.\n\n***Impregilo:***\n----------------\n\n66.\n\nArticle 8(2) of the BIT provides that the dispute *may* be submitted to competent judicial or administrative courts of the State of investment. Unlike some other BITs, it does not provide that it *shall* be submitted to the domestic courts or authorities. It can therefore be concluded that the submission of the dispute to the domestic courts is an option and not a mandatory requirement.\n\n67.\n\nFor several years Impregilo tried in good faith to settle the dispute with Argentina, but the dispute only worsened and culminated in the Province\u2019s unlawful termination of the Concession Contract in mid-2006.\n\n68.\n\nIn addition, AGBA consistently resorted to local administrative and judicial courts in the hope that they would undo the Province\u2019s decisions, but this never occurred. The Argentine courts have had, and still have, the opportunity to decide on the facts that have led to this arbitration, but have either failed to do so or supported the Executive Branch\u2019s position.\n\n69.\n\nIn the present proceedings, the Argentine Republic - more than eight years after the first facts giving rise to this dispute occurred - alleges that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Argentina argues *(i)* that Impregilo failed to comply with the \"amicable consultations\" period, *(ii)* that Impregilo failed to comply with the 18-month period of submission of the dispute before local courts, and *(iii)* that Impregilo\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the MFN clause is flawed.\n\n70.\n\nThe Argentine Republic\u2019s objection disregards the fact that Argentine administrative and judicial courts have had the opportunity to decide on the facts involved in the present case. Nonetheless, they have either failed to render a decision or supported the measures. These claims were based exclusively on contractual issues - although they had the same factual background as the BIT claims in the present case - and Argentine tribunals have had much more than 18 months to decide on this factual background.\n\n71.\n\nThe tribunal in *TSA v. Argentina* understood that the aim of periods before local administrative or judicial courts was to have \"a fair chance of obtaining satisfaction at the national level within the said time frame\".10 The ICJ held in the *Interhandel* case -with respect to the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies under customary international law - that \"the respondent State must first have an opportunity to redress by its own means within the framework of its own domestic legal system the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual\".11 Argentine courts have had plenty of time and have failed to redress the situation. The fact that AGBA - and not Impregilo - was the claimant in those cases is irrelevant for the purposes of the submission of the dispute before local courts.\n\n*TSA, supra* n. 4, para. 110.\n\n*Interhandel Case (Switzerland v. U.S.),* Judgment of Mar. 21, 1959, 1959 ICJ Rep. 5, 27.\n\n72.\n\nThus, Argentina\u2019s argument that the 18-month period was not observed disregards that the main purpose of the 18-month period - that Argentine courts shall have the opportunity to undo the measures giving rise to this dispute - has been satisfied and would even meet the requirements under customary international law requiring the exhaustion of local remedies.\n\n73.\n\nImpregilo emphasizes the futility of pursuing relief in the Argentine legal system. Argentine administrative and judicial courts have had the opportunity to undo the Argentine Government measures that resulted in this BIT arbitration. The mere act of Impregilo submitting its dispute to this Tribunal is evidence of that fact. But the futility of the submission of this dispute for 18 months is also supported by the fact that it could not lead to a decision on the merits within that period. In other words, resorting for 18 months to local courts would be ineffective and would involve disproportionate expenses for Impregilo.\n\n74.\n\nIf the provision establishing the 18-month submission before local courts was construed as a mandatory requirement - which it is not - Impregilo invokes in the alternative the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the BIT. The scope of this provision is extremely broad, since it actually sets forth that the MFN treatment shall be extended to *all* of the matters regulated by the BIT. Such a broad scope clearly includes the dispute settlement provision of the BIT. Impregilo therefore requests the application of the dispute resolution clause of the Argentina-US BIT. This possibility has been unanimously approved by various tribunals, in cases in which Argentina was a party, and in disputes also involving concession contracts similar to the one at issue. Reference is made to the cases of *Maffezini v. Spain,12 Ambatielos,13 Siemens v. Argentina,14 Gas Natural v. Argentina,15 Suez v. Argentina,16 National Grid v. Argentina17* and *Camuzzi v. Argentina.18*\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Spain.* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 *(\"Maffezini\"),* Decision on Jurisdiction, Jan. 25, 2000.\n\n*The Ambatielos Claim (Greece v.

Argentina.* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/7 *(\"Camuzzi II\"),* Decision on Jurisdiction, June 10, 2005.\n\n75.\n\nThe cases invoked by the Respondent, i.e. *Salini, Plama, Berschader, Telenor* and *Wintershall,* are easily distinguished from the present case.\n\n76.\n\nOn the basis of the MFN clause, Impregilo invokes the dispute resolution clause in the Argentina-US BIT, which does not foresee the procedure of waiting for 18 months for local courts to decide on the dispute before the investor may resort to international arbitration. The Argentina-US BIT only provides for a six-month period of consultations to try to amicably resolve the dispute. The six-month period provided for by the dispute resolution clause in the Argentina-US BIT constitutes a more favorable treatment, since it would allow Impregilo to bypass a formalistic, futile and excessively onerous step provided by the BIT.\n\n77.\n\nImpregilo has submitted this dispute neither to the courts nor to the administrative tribunals of the Argentine Republic, nor to any other applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure. Therefore, the first requirement of the Argentina-US BIT has been met.\n\n78.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Impregilo delivered a letter to the Federal Government of Argentina formally notifying it of the dispute in question, seeking to resolve the matter by consultation and negotiation, and notifying the Argentine Republic that Impregilo would seek international arbitration under the terms of the BIT, if the matter could not be resolved by consultation and negotiation. The six month period since this letter was delivered ended on July 24, 2006, and the dispute remains unresolved. Therefore, the second requirement of the Argentina-US BIT has also been met.\n\n***The Arbitral Tribunal:***\n----------------------------\n\n*(i) Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT*\n-------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nArticle 8(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT provides that, if a dispute cannot be settled amicably, it may be submitted to the competent judicial or administrative courts of the Party in whose territory the investment is located. It does not provide that the party \"shall\" or \"must\" submit the case to a local court.\n\n80.\n\nHowever, there is a close connection between Article 8(2) and Article 8(3) which provides that international arbitration may be initiated where, after eighteen months from the date of notice of commencement of proceedings before the courts mentioned in Article 8(2), the dispute between the investor and the Contracting Party has not been resolved.\n\n81.\n\nThere is thus, on the one hand, a clause providing that domestic court proceedings *may* be instituted and, on the other hand, another provision providing, *as a condition for arbitration,* that there have been such proceedings and that these proceedings have been going on for 18 months.\n\n82.\n\nThere could thus appear to be a certain ambiguity in the text of the BIT, and the following two interpretations of the two paragraphs, when read together, would seem to be arguable:\n\n(a) The first interpretation *(Alternative* 7) would place the emphasis on the word \"may\" *(\"podr\u00e1\", \"potr\u00e1\")* and thus on the optional character of Article 8(2) and lead to the conclusion that, as Article 8(2) provides that the investor *may* submit the dispute to the domestic courts, Article 8(3) should be understood to mean that the condition of previous domestic proceedings in Article 8(3) only applies if the investor has used the option and actually brought proceedings before the domestic courts, whereas, if he has not done so, he would be free to proceed at once to international arbitration.\n\n(b) The second interpretation *(Alternative 2)* would be that, although Article 8(2) provides that the investor *may* submit the dispute to the domestic courts, it follows from Article 8(3) that, if the investor wishes to submit a dispute to international arbitration, he must first bring proceedings before the domestic courts and observe the waiting period of 18 months.\n\n83.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that, whatever interpretation is chosen, the term \"may\" in Article 8(2) is justified in the sense that the investor is not obliged to bring the dispute to the domestic courts. The only question that arises in regard to the wording in Article 8(2) is what legal consequences, if any, follow from the investor\u2019s failure to bring the dispute before these courts.\n\n84.\n\nIt may be observed that the word \"may\" is also used in Article 8(3) in regard to the initiation of arbitral proceedings. Here too, there is of course no obligation to submit the dispute to international arbitration.\n\n85.\n\nOn the other hand, it should also be noted that there are other BITs which provide that the investor *shall* bring a dispute before the domestic courts or authorities.\n\n86.\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the terminological differences between BITs do not necessarily mean that any substantive difference was intended. The ambiguity to which they may give rise must be resolved by reading the provisions not only according to their wording but also in their context (cf. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties). The immediate context of Article 8(2) is Article 8(3), and these two provisions, when read together, have to be given a reasonable meaning.\n\n87.\n\nAlternative 1 above would mean that, if the investor does not bring the dispute before the domestic courts, the condition in Article 8(3) of the BIT is not applicable. In other words, the investor would always have a free choice between immediate international arbitration and such arbitration preceded by domestic proceedings during a period of at least 18 months.\n\n88.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds it unlikely that this is what the parties to the BIT had in mind. For the Argentine Government, it must have been desirable to give its courts a first opportunity to resolve disputes with foreign investors. This benefit would of course not materialize if Article 8(3) were interpreted according to Alternative 1.\n\n89.\n\nMoreover, the wording of Article 8(3) indicates that it contains a general condition for international arbitration, and there is no exception for the situation where there had been no domestic proceedings. If the intention had been to provide for such an exception, the wording would most probably have been different. An appropriate wording would then have been, for instance: \"If the dispute has not been submitted to the competent judicial or administrative courts in accordance with paragraph 2 above, or if the dispute, after having been submitted to these courts, has remained unresolved eighteen months after the commencement of proceedings before them, it may be submitted to international arbitration...\".\n\n90.\n\nAs the text now reads, the Tribunal considers that Article 8(3) should be interpreted according to Alternative 2, or, in order words, that it should be considered to set out a general condition that must be complied with by the investor who wishes to submit the dispute to international arbitration. The condition to be complied with is a double one: first bringing the dispute before the domestic courts and then waiting for 18 months before proceeding to international arbitration. This condition has not been complied with by Impregilo.\n\n91.\n\nThis conclusion, according to which Article 8(3) provides a mandatory - but limited in time - jurisdictional requirement before a right to bring a case to ICSID can be exercised, is further supported by other decisions arriving at the same conclusion in regard to similarly worded clauses.\n\n92.\n\nThe *Maffezini* tribunal held that going first to the local courts was a jurisdictional requirement that had to be respected:\n\n\"35.... the Contracting Parties to the BIT\u2014Argentina and Spain\u2014wanted to give their respective courts the opportunity, within the specified period of eighteen months, to resolve the dispute before it could be taken. Had this been the Claimant\u2019s sole argument on the issue, the Tribunal would have had to conclude that because the Claimant failed to submit the instant case to Spanish courts as required by Article X(2) of the BIT, the Centre lacked jurisdiction and the Tribunal lacked competence to hear the case.\"19\n\n*Maffezini, supra* n.12, para. 35.\n\n93.\n\n*Wintershall* stands for the same approach:\n\n\"155. Undoubtedly, the promotion and protection of investment is an object or purpose of the BIT but that promotion and protection in the Argentina-Germany BIT is to be \"on the basis of an agreement\" (i.e. on the basis of the terms of the Treaty - the BIT): which could not possibly exclude the provisions of Article 10(2). If the object and purpose had been to have an immediate unrestricted direct access to ICSID arbitration, then inclusion of Article 10(2) would have been otiose and superfluous. Therefore, the assumption and assertion made in this proceeding (and in some decisions of ICSID Tribunals as well), that since the object and purpose of a BIT is to protect and promote investments, unrestricted direct access to ICSID must be presumed, is contrary to the text (and context) of this BIT, i.e., the Argentina-Germany BIT.\"\n\n4. Conclusion on the first aspect of Argentina\u2019s first Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction\n\n156. To conclude - for the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal\u2019s decision on this first part of Argentina\u2019s first Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction is that Wintershall (the Claimant) could not avoid prior compliance with Article 10(2) of the Argentina-Germany BIT before initiating arbitration proceedings. Not having so complied with Article 10(2), the Tribunal has no competence to entertain the claim and to proceed with it on merits.\"\n\n94.\n\nIn sum, Article 8(3) contains a jurisdictional requirement that has to be fulfilled before an ICSID tribunal can assert jurisdiction. This decision is in accordance with the decision in *Wintershall,* where it was found for a very similar clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT, that \"Article 10(2) contains a time-bound prior-recourse-to-local-courts-clause, which mandates (not merely permits) litigation by the investor (for a definite period) in the domestic forum\"20, before the right to ICSID can even materialize. Impregilo not having fulfilled this requirement, the Tribunal cannot find jurisdiction on the basis of Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n*Wintershall, supra* n. 3 para. 118\n\n*(b) The MFN clause*\n--------------------\n\n95.\n\nHowever, Impregilo has also invoked the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT and has argued that, *via* that clause, the more generous rules in the Argentine-US BIT should be applied to the dispute. According to the dispute settlement clause in Article VII of that BIT, the investor may choose to submit the dispute for resolution to the domestic courts or administrative tribunals, or to deal with it in accordance with previously agreed dispute settlement procedures, or, after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, to submit it to international arbitration.\n\n96.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall, within its own territory, accord to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the income and activities related to such investments and to all other matters regulated by this Agreement, a treatment that is no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or investors from third-party countries\".\n\n97.\n\nIn support of its contention that the MFN clause cannot be applied, the Argentine Republic has invoked:\n\n(a) that Impregilo\u2019s interpretation does not give proper effect to the terms of the MFN clause,\n\n(b) that the MFN clause refers to treatment by the Contracting Party \"within its own territory\", whereas arbitration takes place outside Argentina and beyond its sovereign powers,\n\n(c) that resorting to domestic courts cannot be deemed as something unfavorable for investors, and\n\n(d) that the 18-month clause is an essential clause of the BIT and, therefore, cannot be set aside by the MFN clause.\n\n98.\n\nOn point (a) the Argentine Republic relies on the wording of the MFN clause in Article 3(1) which applies to \"treatment\" and which, before referring to \"all other matters\", enumerates \"investments\" and \"income and activities related to such investments\".\n\n99.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the term \"treatment\" is in itself wide enough to be applicable also to procedural matters such as dispute settlement. Moreover, the wording \"all other matters regulated by this Agreement\" is certainly also wide enough to cover the dispute settlement rules. The argument that the *ejusdem generis* principle would limit its application to matters similar to \"investments\" and \"income and activities related to such investments\" is not convincing, since the wording does not allow \"all other matters\" to be read as \"all similar matters\" or \"all other matters of the same kind\". Nor is the argument that an all-embracing concept like \"all other matters\" would make the previously mentioned terms \"investments\" and \"income and activities related to such investments\" superfluous, since it is indeed not unusual in legal drafting to indicate typical examples even in provisions which are intended to be of general application.\n\n100.\n\nAs regards point (b), the Arbitral Tribunal accepts that the words \"within its own territory\" limit the scope of the MFN clause. In the present case, however, the question as to what legal protection Argentina shall give to foreign investors is in no way an issue over which Argentina has no power to decide, nor is it tied to any particular territory. The Tribunal therefore considers that the wording \"within its own territory\" does not exclude the application of the MFN clause to dispute settlement.\n\n101.\n\nAs regards point (c), the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the relevant question is not whether resorting to domestic courts is more or less favorable to investors than international arbitration. Instead, what should be considered is whether a *choice* between domestic proceedings and international arbitration, as in the Argentina-US BIT, is more favorable to the investor than compulsory domestic proceedings before access is opened to arbitration. The answer to this question is in general, and certainly in this case, evident: a system that gives a choice is more favorable to the investor than a system that gives no choice.\n\n102.\n\nFinally, point (d) presents a more difficult issue. In this respect, the Argentine Republic has pointed out, *inter alia,* that Argentina has included in several of its BITs, even those concluded after the Argentina-US BIT, a clause about domestic proceedings and an 18-month waiting period. This could be seen as an indication that Argentina did not intend these clauses to be replaced, via MFN clauses in the same BITs, by the rules of the Argentina-US BIT as being more favorable to the investor. However, the argument becomes less persuasive in the present case, because the Italy-Argentina BIT (signed on 22 May 1990) preceded the Argentina-US BIT (signed on 14 November 1991).\n\n103.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal must also attach special weight to the wording of the MFN clause, which extends its scope to \"all other matters regulated by this Agreement\". Given the breadth of the this language, the clause must be considered to encompass dispute settlement provisions.\n\n104.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal further notes that there is a massive volume of case-law which indicates that, at least when there is an MFN clause applying to \"all matters\" regulated in the BIT, more favorable dispute settlement clauses in other BITs will be incorporated. Relevant cases are *Maffezini,21 Gas Natural,22 Suez,23 Suez*24 and *Camuzzi25*\n\n*Maffezini, supra* n. 12, paras. 38-64.\n\n*Gas Natural, supra* n. 15, paras. 41-49.\n\n*Suez, supra* n. 16, paras. 52-66.\n\n*Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/2 *(\"Camuzzi I\"),* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, May 11,2005, paras. 120-21.\n\n105.\n\nEven in some - but not all - cases where the MFN clauses were less comprehensive and only provided for MFN treatment of investors and investments, the tribunals found this to be sufficient to cover dispute settlement. Cases in point are *Siemens,26 National Grid27* and *RosInvest.28*\n\n*Siemens, supra* n. 14, paras. 87-90.\n\n*National Grid, supra* n. 17, paras. 79-94.\n\n*RosInvest v. Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. V079/2005 *(\"RosInvest\"),* Award on Jurisdiction, Oct. 2007, paras. 124-39.\n\n106.\n\nHowever, the case law is not fully consistent in so far as there is at least one case in which the tribunal, despite the fact that the MFN clause covered \"all matters\", found this insufficient to make the clause applicable to dispute settlement. The case is *Berschader,* but it should be noted that one of the arbitrators strongly dissented on this point and that there were also some special elements which contributed to the outcome.29\n\n*Berschader,* Separate Opinion of Prof. Todd Weiler, paras. 15-25; *Berschader,* Award on Jurisdiction, paras. 185 - 208. Notably, the MFN clause at issue *vci Berschader* stated that it would apply \"particularly to Articles 4, 5 and 6\", *i.e.,* fair and equitable treatment, non-expropriation and free transfer of funds, but did not include within this list Article 10 of the BIT, which addressed dispute resolution, and accordingly, the tribunal concluded that the ordinary meaning of \"all matters covered by the present Treaty\" was not really that the MFN provision extends to all matters covered by the Treaty. *Id.* para. 194. In addition, the tribunal noted that there had been no clarity in the jurisprudence at the time the BIT had been concluded as to whether arbitration clauses could be encompassed by MFN clauses, and thus, the Parties simply may not have contemplated this outcome. *Id.* para. 202. Finally, the tribunal considered evidence of BIT practice from the Soviet Union which demonstrated that it pursued a policy of never consenting to arbitration in BITs concerning questions whether an act of expropriation had occurred, which stemmed from that State\u2019s particular views on sovereignty. In the tribunal\u2019s view, this \u2019\u2019strongly suggest[ed]\" that the Soviet Union did not intend for the MFN clause to extend to dispute resolution issues. *Id.* para. 204.\n\n107.\n\nIn other cases where dispute settlement rules in other BITs were not considered to have been incorporated as a result of MFN clauses, these clauses were not, according to their wording, applicable to \"all matters\", but provided for MFN treatment of investors or investments. The Arbitral Tribunal refers in this respect to the cases of *Salini,30 Plama,31 Telenor*32 and *Wintershall.*33 It appears from these awards that some tribunals have had rather strong reservations about the general development of the case law in this area. It is therefore clear that these issues remain controversial and that the predominating jurisprudence which has developed is in no way universally accepted.\n\n*Salini, supra* n. 6, paras. 116-19.\n\n*Plama, supra* n. 7, paras. 183-227.\n\n*Telenor, supra* n. 8, paras. 83-101.\n\n*Wintershall, supra* n. 3, paras. 161-68.\n\n108.\n\nNevertheless, the Arbitral Tribunal finds it unfortunate if the assessment of these issues would in each case be dependent on the personal opinions of individual arbitrators. The best way to avoid such a result is to make the determination on the basis of case law whenever a clear case law can be discerned. It is true that, as stated above, the jurisprudence regarding the application of MFN clauses to settlement of disputes provisions is not fully consistent. Nevertheless, in cases where the MFN clause has referred to \"all matters\" or \"any matter\" regulated in the BIT, there has been near-unanimity in finding that the clause covered the dispute settlement rules. On this basis, the majority of the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Impregilo is entitled to rely, in this respect, on the dispute settlement rules in the Argentina-US BIT and that the case cannot be dismissed for non-observance of the requirements in Article 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n109.\n\nArbitrator Stern disagrees with the application of the MFN clause to dispute settlement. Her views are elaborated in the appended dissenting opinion.\n\n**B. Second objection: ICSID lacks the jurisdiction and the Tribunal lacks the competence to hear indirect and derivative claims filed by shareholders** ***The Argentine Republic:***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nImpregilo argues that it directly and indirectly holds 42.58% of AGBA\u2019s shares of stock and invokes that shareholding and a capital contribution made in its capacity as shareholder of AGBA as its investment in Argentina. Impregilo\u2019s case is based upon the alleged harm caused by Argentina\u2019s measures to certain guarantees and protections provided by both the Regulatory Framework and the Concession Contract, which harm in turn allegedly resulted from Argentina\u2019s failure to comply with the Treaty.\n\n111.\n\nImpregilo does not allege any harm to its rights as a shareholder but bases all its claims on measures exclusively affecting the Concession Contract and the Regulatory Framework, under which instruments Impregilo does not have or invoke any right whatsoever. It is, then, a typical indirect or derivative claim - where a shareholder claims damages due to measures taken in relation to the corporation in which it holds shares - in respect of which ICSID has no jurisdiction and the Tribunal has no competence.\n\n112.\n\nThere is no doubt that a corporation is a legal entity separate from its shareholders, with rights and liabilities entirely distinct from theirs. Likewise, it is well established that a shareholder does not have an individual cause of action against third parties for wrongs or injuries to the corporation in which he or she holds stock, even if he or she suffers harm from the damage to the corporation, such as a reduction in the value of his or her stock. The BIT does not modify the rule that shareholders are not entitled to bring claims for damages suffered by the company in which they have shares. Reference is made in this regard to the *Barcelona Traction* case.34 A central question in that case was how to transplant the domestic legal institution of shareholders in a corporation into the realm of international law. The answer given by the International Court of Justice was that the essential features of this institution must be preserved when it is the object of an international claim. Precisely the same answer must be given by investment treaty tribunals.\n\n*Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain),* Judgment, Feb. 5, 1970, 1970 ICJ Rep. 3 *((\u2018Barcelona Traction \"* ***).***\n\n113.\n\nClaims related to investment disputes may be subject to the jurisdiction of ICSID provided that the requirements set forth in the ICSID Convention and the BIT are met. The jurisdictional boundaries of an ICSID tribunal are defined by the objective criteria set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. At the time of drafting of the ICSID Convention, the drafters considered the possibility of allowing controlling shareholders of local corporations to file direct actions. The reason was simple: many investors operate through a local company (either because it is required by the host State or because it is the company\u2019s own choice), and the local company itself would be excluded from the coverage of the ICSID Convention, since it would be a national of the State receiving the investment. However, the possibility of granting controlling shareholders of local corporations direct access to the ICSID system in respect of rights of the local corporation was entirely rejected. The possibility prescribed by Article 25(2)(b) *in fine* of the ICSID Convention was included instead: the possibility that a local company, controlled by a foreign owner, be given the right to sue its own State, provided that the parties had agreed that the local company should be treated as a national of the host State due to its foreign control. This Article was inserted by the drafters precisely to avoid the problems associated with indirect claims by foreign shareholders in locally incorporated investment companies.\n\n114.\n\nHowever, following *CMS v. Argentina,35* a number of tribunals have adopted the same approach as in that case, allowing shareholders to bring indirect claims in respect of the reduction in the value of their shares. They have done so by completely ignoring the basic contours of the rights attaching to shares in all domestic legal systems and by turning a blind eye to the ramifications of a \"solution\" that allows any shareholder to bring any claim in respect of any prejudice caused to the company. This solution is perverse as a matter of legal principle.\n\n*CMS* v. *Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8 *(\"CMS\"),* Decision on Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003, paras. 36-65.\n\n115.\n\nThe *CMS* tribunal and its followers have failed to address the ramifications of a blanket rule that would allow any type of derivative claim by the shareholders. The decision of jurisdiction in *Pan American Energy v. Argentina36* is typical in its ambivalence in regard to these issues.\n\n*Pan American Energy LLC, BP Argentina Exploration Company, BP America Production Company, Pan American Sur S.R.L. and Pan American Continental, S.R.L. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Cases No. ARB/O3/13 and ARB/04/8 *(\"Pan American/BP\"),* Decision on Preliminary Objections, July 27, 2006, paras. 209-22.\n\n116.\n\nIn contrast, it was precisely these types of factors that led the tribunal in *GAMI v. Mexico* to dismiss GAMI\u2019s claims.37 There are signs that some tribunals are beginning to recognize that the *CMS* approach to derivative claims is unsustainable. At least some tribunals now raise the problem of potentially unlimited claims in relation to the same injury. For instance, in *Enron v. Argentina,*38 the tribunal proposed that the test of an \"invitation\" be adopted, inquiring whether the investor was \"invited\" to invest in the host State. This test only needs to be stated to demonstrate that it is wholly subjective and patently unworkable.\n\n*Gami Investments, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL, Award, Nov. 15, 2004, paras. 26-43.\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (*\"Enron \"),* Jan. 14, 2004, paras. 54-57.\n\n117.\n\nOther tribunals faced up to the problem but failed to provide a solution.39\n\n*Camuzzi I,* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 37, and *Noble Energy Inc. and MachalaPower Cia Ltda. v. Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/12 (*\"Noble*\"), Decision on Jurisdiction of Mar. 5, 2008, paras. 77-83.\n\n118.\n\nIndeed, the admission of derivative claims poses several problems, one of the most acute being double (or even multiple) recovery. Many tribunals in cases involving Argentina have recognized this danger,40 but none has advanced a solution for it. The *Sempra* tribunal specifically addressed the possible double recovery \"resulting from, on the one hand, the compensation which the investor would receive as a result of arbitration and, on the other hand, the compensation which the company would receive in the context of a renegotiated adjustment of tariffs or some other mechanism\".41 In the tribunal\u2019s view, double recovery was not likely. However, double recovery has to be avoided through legal considerations (such as who is the holder of the affected rights who is entitled to compensation, etc.), and by means of proper interpretation of the applicable instruments.\n\n*See* *Enron,* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 54-57: *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 (*\"Sempra*\"), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, May 11, 2005, para. 102; *Sempra,* Award, Sept. 28, 2007, para. 395; *Suez,* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 51; *Pan American/**BP,* Decision on Preliminary Objections, paras. 209-22.\n\n*Sempra,* Award, para. 395.\n\n119.\n\nIn the present case, AGBA has filed legal actions against the measures which Impregilo also challenges in this arbitration. Thus, it is clear that there is a very concrete risk of double recovery in this case. No tribunal acting according to law and justice can accept an action that not only is inadmissible, but opens the door to the actual possibility of the respondent having to pay twice for the same damage, or even more.\n\n120.\n\nSumming up, the Centre has no jurisdiction and the Tribunal has no competence to hear derivative claims as those presented by Impregilo in the current proceeding.\n\n***Impregilo:***\n----------------\n\n121.\n\nImpregilo is not pursuing the rights of AGBA but is bringing claims on its own behalf as an Italian investor with qualifying investments under the Argentina-Italy BIT. International law and investment arbitration tribunals have recognized claims by shareholders in the position of Impregilo.\n\n122.\n\nImpregilo submits this dispute before the Tribunal because Argentina:\n\n(a) directly nationalized Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA without any compensation;\n\n(b) failed to treat Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA fairly and equitably;\n\n(c) impaired by unjustified and discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA;\n\n(d) failed to provide full protection and security to Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA; and\n\n(e) violated specific obligations entered into with respect to Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA.\n\n123.\n\nThe inclusion of shareholders is confirmed by Article l(1)(b) of the BIT, which defines investments as \"any kind of asset invested or reinvested by an individual or a legal entity of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Party\", such as \"shares of stock, interests or any other form of participation, including minority or indirect interest, in a company incorporated in the territory of either Contracting Party\". Thus, Impregilo\u2019s shareholding in AGBA is a covered investment and Impregilo is entitled to bring a claim in respect of it.\n\n124.\n\nThe protection of shareholders is further confirmed by the Preamble of the BIT, which provides that the BIT shall contribute to the encouragement of business initiatives conducive to the prosperity of both Contracting Parties. Italian investors who create or own shares in Argentine companies contribute \"to the prosperity of\u2019 Argentina. Thus, the very object and purpose of the BIT encompasses shareholders. It makes no distinction between shareholders and other types of investors.\n\n125.\n\nMoreover, claims by shareholders are well recognized in international law and in investment arbitration in particular. This is a natural consequence of the fact that the objective of BITs is to encourage foreign investors to acquire shares in a local company in the host State, often because the host State requires it. In the present case, the Government of Argentina required the consortium which won the bid for the water concession in the Province of Buenos Aires to incorporate a local company. If the BIT did not protect investors in Impregilo\u2019s position, it would become irrelevant and meaningless.\n\n126.\n\nImpregilo is not pursuing claims that can only be submitted by AGBA, and its claims are therefore not indirect. Impregilo filed these BIT claims in its own capacity as an Italian investor in Argentina and its claims arise directly from its rights under the BIT. That the characterization of an action as one arising under a BIT is independent of whether it also raises local issues or causes of action finds abundant support in investment arbitration case-law. The *Vivendi v. Argentina* case is particularly relevant to the present case. The claims in that case mainly involved acts of Argentine authorities interfering with the operation of a concession contract. The Annulment Committee had no doubt that the foreign shareholder could bring its own claims under the Argentina-France BIT.42 Accordingly, Impregilo is entitled to claim that Argentina\u2019s conduct was in breach of the BIT, even if that conduct may also amount to a breach of AGBA\u2019s rights. Impregilo\u2019s claims are BIT claims, and cannot in any way be regarded as a purported exercise of contractual legal rights.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (*\"Vivendi*\"), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 73.\n\n127.\n\nThe Argentine Government has consistently raised the same objection which has been repeatedly rejected in numerous decisions. In light of the decisions in *CMS, Azurix,* both *Enron* cases, L *GE. AES, Suez, BG, El Paso, PanAmerican/BP,* both cases filed by *Camuzzi, Continental Casualty, Gas Natural, Siemens* and *Noble Energy,* Argentina\u2019s objection on alleged \"indirect\" or \"derivative\" claims is groundless.43 In addition, shareholders\u2019 claims have also been affirmed by the Annulment Committee in CATS'.44\n\n*See generally, CMS v.

Sri Lanka45, AMT v. Zaire46, Goetz v. Burundi47, Maffezini v. Spain48* and *Genin v. Estonia.49* The Annulment Committee in the *Vivendi* case was faced with the question of whether the French investor, CGE, could have brought the claim on behalf of the local company, CAA, in its capacity as a controlling shareholder of CAA. The Committee considered the question irrelevant because in any event CGE could have brought the claim for its shareholding in CAA, which was an investment protected under the Treaty.50\n\n*Asian Agrie.

As decided by many previous tribunals, there is a direct right of action for shareholders like Impregilo in such circumstances.\n\n130.\n\nThe *Barcelona Traction* case does not support Argentina\u2019s position. In that case, the issue before the International Court of Justice was whether, under customary international law, Belgium could exercise diplomatic protection with respect to losses incurred by Belgian shareholders in a Canadian company as a result of the acts of Spanish authorities affecting the company. The Court held that Belgium had no *jus standi* and did not examine whether international law provided an independent source of rights and protections for shareholders. Moreover, the Court in Barcelona Traction explicitly recognized the direct protection of shareholders in BITs.51\n\n*Barcelona Traction, supra* n. 34, para. 90.\n\n131.\n\nImpregilo refers to another decision by the International Court of Justice, *i.e.* the *ELSI* case. In that case, the US brought an action against Italy under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the two countries for damage caused to US shareholders in an Italian company.52 In its judgment, the Court did not even address the question of whether the substantive provisions of the treaty *(inter alia,* the guarantees of full protection and security and no expropriation of property belonging to US nationals without compensation) granted protection to the US shareholders in relation to acts of the Italian authorities aimed at the company. By examining the merits of the claims, the Court clearly considered that the treaty protected the shareholders.\n\n*Case concerning the Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States v. Italy),* Judgment, July 20, 1989, 1989 ICJ Rep. 15.\n\n132.\n\nThe *ELSI* case is a much more relevant precedent for this arbitration than *Barcelona Traction.* The proliferation of shareholders\u2019 protection in BITs and other investment treaties means that international law now recognizes that corporate personality does not preclude the international protection of shareholders affected by host-state measures injuring both the company and the shareholders.\n\n133.\n\nCoursing through Argentina\u2019s objection is a policy argument implying an atomization of interests, which could theoretically result in a multitude of BIT claims against Argentina.\n\n134.\n\nFirst, this hypothetical argument is irrelevant. Argentina\u2019s apparent displeasure with the potential ramifications of its conduct in violation of the BIT does not authorize ICSID tribunals to ignore or re-write the treaty to assuage Argentina\u2019s belated objection to the very instrument that it signed and ratified specifically to induce foreign investment.\n\n135.\n\nMoreover, the Argentine Republic\u2019s argument regarding a potential double recovery by both the shareholders and the local company is an issue that concerns the merits. But in addition, and perhaps more importantly, Argentina goes as far as to allege that the Tribunal should not find jurisdiction because there is a potential risk of double recovery when Argentina has taken measures to the detriment of Impregilo\u2019s investment since the early years of AGBA\u2019s concession and unlawfully nationalized the concession without granting any compensation. Furthermore, local courts have had plenty of time and opportunities to grant compensation but have not done so.\n\n136.\n\nArgentina also misinterprets Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. In part, Article 25(2)(b) allows consenting parties to agree that a company incorporated in the host State and controlled by the foreign investor will be regarded as a foreign investor for purposes of the ICSID Convention and thereby be permitted to pursue a claim before ICSID in its own name. But Article 25(2)(b) is irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Impregilo\u2019s claims. Article 25(2)(b) merely provides an option and does not have any effect on claims that separately qualify under Article 25(1). It does not affect a foreign investor\u2019s right to stand before ICSID in its own name.\n\n***The Arbitral Tribunal:***\n----------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that Impregilo was one of the parties in the consortium that was granted the concession for water and sewage services for a certain area within the Province of Buenos Aires. In accordance with the applicable requirements, the consortium formed an Argentine company, AGBA, with which the Concession Contract was concluded.\n\n138.\n\nIt follows from Article l(1)(b) of the Argentina-Italy BIT that Impregilo\u2019s shares in AGBA were protected under the BIT. If AGBA was subjected to expropriation or unfair treatment with respect to its concession - an issue to be determined on the merits of the case - such action must also be considered to have affected Impregilo\u2019s rights as an investor, rights that were protected under the BIT.\n\n139.\n\nThe question of double compensation being granted would seem to the Arbitral Tribunal to be a theoretical rather than a real practical problem. It seems obvious that if compensation were granted to AGBA at domestic level, this would affect the claims that Impregilo could make under the BIT, and conversely, any compensation granted to Impregilo at international level would affect the claims that could be presented by AGBA before Argentine courts.\n\n140.\n\nIn any case, there is, as the Argentine Republic itself admits, a substantial case-law showing that claims such as those presented by Impregilo enjoy protection under the applicable BITs. The Arbitral Tribunal finds no reason to depart from that case-law.\n\n**C. Third objection: The claims address contractual matters over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction** ***The Argentine Republic:***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nAll the claims made by Impregilo are contract claims over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. As the Annulment Committee expressed in the *Vivendi* case, \"where \u2018the fundamental basis of the claim\u2019\" is the contract it will be a contract claim and not a treaty claim.53\n\n*Vivendi, supra* n. 42, para. 101.\n\n142.\n\nIn the case *Impregilo v. Pakistan,* the tribunal, following the analysis of the Annulment Committee of the *Vivendi* case, made a distinction between a breach of contract and a violation of the treaty, and recalled that the threshold to establish a breach of the treaty was a high one.54\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A.v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction of Apr. 22, 2005, paras. 260 and 267.\n\n143.\n\nThe claims made by Impregilo in the present case relate to decisions made in the implementation and development of the AGBA concession. They are related to the interpretation and application of the Regulatory Framework and the Concession Contract. All the claims are contract claims that, paraphrasing the tribunal of the *TSA* v. *Argentina* case, have no relation with the \"rights and obligations of a different and more fundamental nature\" provided for in the BIT.55\n\n7X4, *supra* n. 4, para. 60.\n\n144.\n\nAlthough Impregilo presents a controversy with multiple issues, wishing to give the impression that there is a behavioral pattern that will tie together the different measures that have been challenged, this does not change the fact that all the issues are eminently contractual and require an interpretation of very specific and detailed contractual clauses.\n\n145.\n\nImpregilo\u2019s claims essentially relate to the following issues: (i) the failure to build three sewage treatment plants (the UNIREC plants) in the concession area, (ii) the failure to update the database of AGBA\u2019s users, the non-application of the \"concession extra charges\", \"works costs\" and \"sewage coefficient\", the non-application of contractual provisions on tax stabilization, the promotion of client payment delay, the obligation to install meters at clients\u2019 request and the delay in responding to clients by AGBA, (iii) the modification twice of the Regulatory Framework, (iv) the lack of support to AGBA in its attempts to obtain funding, (v) the alleged discrimination against AGBA, and (vi) the termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n146.\n\nIn none of these claims does the alleged violation resulting from the BIT stand on its own, but Impregilo brings forth a contractual breach as the fundamental element or premise of the claims.\n\n147.\n\nIn January 1999, the Province approved the concession\u2019s bidding conditions. The consortium formed by Impregilo decided to participate in this process. The consortium was made aware of the scope of these conditions before making its offer, in spite of which it continued to be interested in the bidding process and made its offer. Having presented its offer, the consortium accepted the scope of the bidding conditions and their clarifying circulars. The fact that Impregilo waived all other jurisdictions prior to the filing of this claim makes the consent to the arbitration invalid.\n\n148.\n\nOn October 18, 1999, the concession over the relevant area was awarded to the consortium formed by Impregilo. On December 7, 1999, the Province and AGBA signed the Concession Contract. The AGBA Concession Contract expressly provided that disputes should be submitted to the competent contentious administrative forum in the City of La Plata, with express waiver of any other forum or jurisdiction that may be applicable for any reason whatsoever.\n\n149.\n\nIn spite of the clarity of the above-mentioned clauses, Impregilo attempts to frame its claims within the Argentina-Italy BIT, when it is clear that those claims are exclusively contractual in nature and, therefore, the clauses of those contractual documents are the clauses that should be taken into account to analyze the jurisdictional issue.\n\n150.\n\nThe clauses are totally clear as to the fact that if the parties considered there to be a controversy, all claims in that regard should be made through the forum therein established, to the exclusion of any other forum. The validity of such clause is corroborated by the proceedings initiated by AGBA before the local courts.\n\n151.\n\nIt is true that many of the same clauses were addressed by the tribunal in the *Azurix* v. *Argentine Republic* case and that the tribunal in that case considered that the waiver did not cover the respondent\u2019s claim because \"the State is not a party to any of the Contract Documents, and there was no waiver commitment made by the Claimant in favour of Argentina\".56 Argentina respectfully considers that the opinion of the tribunal was wrong and that the reasons outlined in its decision were not convincing.\n\n*Azurix, supra* n. 43, para. 85\n\n152.\n\nIn addition to the fact that all claims fried by Impregilo are contract-based claims and that, therefore, the Tribunal is not competent as the Treaty only upholds the Tribunal\u2019s competence \"with regard to matters governed by the [Treaty]\", AGBA, of which Impregilo is a shareholder, brought an action before the courts of the Province of Buenos Aires with respect to the same claims being asserted by Impregilo in the instant proceeding. AGBA challenged not only administrative acts related to the concession, but also the main decisions of the authorities in the Province of Buenos Aires on which Impregilo bases its claims.\n\n153.\n\nIt follows that the Tribunal should dismiss Impregilo\u2019s claims as they deal wholly with matters on which ICSID does not have jurisdiction. For these same claims, AGBA has resorted to the courts in the Province of Buenos Aires. Allowing Impregilo\u2019s claims would entail running the risk that Impregilo may obtain compensation in this forum and through the instant proceeding, with the consequent danger that, if these same claims are analyzed by an international tribunal, there would be contradictory decisions and possibly even situations involving \"double compensation\".\n\n154.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal cannot base its competence on an umbrella clause in Article II(2)(c) of the BIT between Argentina and the US. Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT is limited to \"matters regulated by this Agreement\". The umbrella clause in the Argentina-US BIT is not a matter that is governed by the Argentina-Italy BIT, which contains no umbrella clause whatsoever. Consequently, an umbrella clause cannot be incorporated via the MFN clause. In fact, Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT does not include any express reference to jurisdiction. The wording of Article 3(1) does not cover clearly and unequivocally the scope of Argentina\u2019s agreement to the arbitration under Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. Moreover, the reference to \"all other matters\" does not expressly refer to the scope of the agreement from the host country to submit an issue to arbitration. Argentina argues that the Tribunal lacks any competence with respect to the claims based on the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the BIT Argentina-Italy regarding the umbrella clause under Article II(2)(c) of the Argentina-US BIT. The latter is not a protection standard governed by the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n155.\n\nIn any case, notwithstanding the purely jurisdictional issue, the MFN clause in the Argentina-Italy BIT does not incorporate the umbrella clause of the Argentina-US BIT. The umbrella clause is not within the purpose covered by the MFN clause or within the territorial scope of the latter and any attempt to extend it would be against the express purposes of the Parties to the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n156.\n\nMoreover, compliance with Argentina\u2019s obligations is not treatment \"within [Argentine] territory\" under the terms of Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. Also, the MFN clause in the Argentina-Italy BIT may not prevail on core issues which, owing to their significance and importance, should be negotiated by the parties specifically. An umbrella clause concerns such a core issue. General international law does not guarantee compliance with contractual commitments or local law. The umbrella clause introduces an exception to the general separation of obligations under domestic law and international public law. Although the parties may agree to depart from this general international law basic principle, such departure is a core issue that must be specifically negotiated.\n\n***Impregilo:***\n----------------\n\n157.\n\nRegardless of whether Impregilo\u2019s claims could also raise questions relating to the Concession Contract, Impregilo is asserting a cause of action under the BIT. From the mere fact that Impregilo\u2019s claims relate in some manner to the Concession Contract, Argentina reaches the conclusion that all claims are contract claims over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. Although Argentina certainly breached and then abrogated the Concession Contract in multiple respects, that is not the dispute that Impregilo has put before the Tribunal. Instead, Impregilo claims that Argentina violated the BIT when it *(i)* confiscated Impregilo\u2019s investment; *(ii)* failed to treat Impregilo\u2019s investment fairly and equitably; *(iii)* impaired by unjustified and discriminatory measures Impregilo\u2019s investment; *(iv)* failed to observe the obligations entered into with regard to Impregilo\u2019s investment; and *(v)* failed to provide full protection and security to Impregilo\u2019s investment.\n\n158.\n\nSignificant arbitral decisions establish that the mere fact that certain elements of an investment dispute also involve (or can be characterized as) breaches of contract does not suffice to transform a BIT dispute into a non-international contract claim or to divest ICSID of jurisdiction. In *Vivendi,* the Annulment Committee clarified that BIT claims often involve taking into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of the BIT. This does not prevent the claims from being treaty claims for which arbitration under the BIT is available. The Annulment Committee found that the tribunal was wrong in holding that it could not consider any allegation of breach of treaty that required it to interpret or apply the Concession Contract.57\n\n*Vivendi, supra* n. 42, paras. 112-13.\n\n159.\n\nUnder comparable circumstances, ICSID decisions on jurisdiction have uniformly rejected the argument that the existence of claims based on an underlying concession, contract or license divests a BIT tribunal of jurisdiction. For example, the *Azurix* tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s objection that Azurix\u2019s claim was a contractual claim arising out of its concession agreement with the Province of Buenos Aires.58 Reference is also made *to LG&E,59 Total v. Argentina60* and *IBM v. Ecuador.61*\n\n*Azurix, supra* n. 43, para. 76.\n\n*LG&E, supra* n., para. 62.\n\n*Total S.A.* v. *Argentina.* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, Aug. 25, 2006.\n\n*IBM World Trade Corporation v. Ecuador.* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/10, Decision on Jurisdiction, Dec. 22, 2003.\n\n160.\n\nArgentina seems to overlook the fact that this dispute involves some of the most flagrant sovereign acts of a State: the imposition of new regulatory rules, the unilateral alteration of the conditions under which a business was to operate and, most importantly, the actual nationalization of Impregilo\u2019s investment without compensation.\n\n161.\n\nMoreover, even if Impregilo\u2019s claims were exclusively contractual, that would not necessarily divest ICSID of jurisdiction, for \"[i]t is clear from the general language of Article 25(1) that ICSID jurisdiction may extend to disputes which are purely contractual in character\".62 At the jurisdictional stage, the question is only whether the \"essential basis\" of the factual allegations about the host state\u2019s actions, however they are characterized, could constitute violations of obligations incumbent on that State by virtue of a BIT or other relevant international law instrument. Therefore, even if reference must be made to the underlying contracts, this does not convert the BIT claims into mere breach of contract claims.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, Jan. 29, 2004.\n\n162.\n\nImpregilo claims for specific violations of the BIT relative to the investments made by it in Argentina. Assuming the truth of the factual allegations made by Impregilo in this case, it is quite clear that those allegations could establish violations of the BIT. It is against this test that the Tribunal must consider the jurisdictional merit of Impregilo\u2019s claims.\n\n163.\n\nImpregilo\u2019s right of action under the BIT is not precluded by the forum-selection clauses in the bidding terms or the Concession Contract, because, regardless of whether Impregilo\u2019s claims raise questions relating to the Concession Contract, Impregilo is asserting a cause of action under the BIT. In addition, the forum-selection clauses mentioned by the Argentine Government have no effect on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The same objection based on virtually the same clauses was rejected by the *Azurix* tribunal.63\n\n*Azurix, supra* n. 43, para. 77.\n\n164.\n\nIn so far as the Argentine Republic refers to the bidding terms, it should be noted that there is a lack of mutuality between the claims contemplated in the bidding terms and claims arising out of the BIT. In addition, as noted by the express language of the choice-of-forum provision found in the bidding terms, the nature and scope of the parties\u2019 agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province is limited to \"bidding disputes\".\n\n165.\n\nThe Argentine Republic also misinterprets the scope of the Concession Contract. Using the same line of argumentation as that applied to the bidding terms, Argentina makes note of the choice-of-forum provision found in the Concession Contract, as it has previously done unsuccessfully in a myriad of cases before ICSID tribunals. This proposition, however, fails for the same reasons as the corresponding proposition regarding the bidding terms. Principally, the scope of the choice-of-forum provision is not applicable to claims arising out of the BIT. The language found in the choice-of-forum provision makes it clear that its scope of application is limited to any dispute regarding the construction and execution of the Concession Contract. This, of course, limits the types of claims that are required to be submitted to the courts of the Province to disputes concerning the Concession Contract.\n\n166.\n\nA waiver of investment rights such as those provided under a treaty must be express and unequivocal and made by the parties involved in the dispute. In the present case, Impregilo has not in any manner waived its right to protection under the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n167.\n\nArgentina provided its consent to ICSID jurisdiction in this case through the open invitation made to Italian investors in the BIT. In so doing, Argentina did not express any reservation concerning the applicability of the ICSID Convention in its territory and did not denounce the Convention. Even if it had done so, such an act would not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction due to the consent to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction provided before such notice. As Argentina is the Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, any participation of its constituent subdivisions or agencies before the Centre or its tribunals requires a decision of the Contracting State and its previous notice to the Centre.\n\n168.\n\nUnder Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, a constituent subdivision of a Contracting State may have standing before an ICSID tribunal if it has been designated to the Centre by that State. Under Article 25(3), consent by such a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State requires the approval of the State unless that State notifies the Centre that no such approval is required.\n\n169.\n\nArgentina has not made such a designation and given such approval. Since the Province was never designated to ICSID, the Province has no authority to act before it, much less to rescind Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction provided through the BIT or to issue any provision in relation to ICSID jurisdiction in Impregilo\u2019s proceedings against Argentina.\n\n170.\n\nArgentina suggests that Impregilo has waived an ICSID venue in favor of the Provincial contentious administrative courts of the city of La Plata. The adoption of this proposition would constitute a denial of justice to Impregilo, as well as a *de facto* repeal of Argentina\u2019s obligations to Impregilo under the BIT, since Impregilo would be left without a proper forum to enforce its BIT rights.\n\n171.\n\nA long-standing principle of Argentine law states that only federal courts have the power to hear cases in which the Argentine Republic is a party or which concern federal matters such as international treaties. Consequently, the Provincial courts lack competence to examine Impregilo\u2019s BIT claims.\n\n172.\n\nImpregilo also invokes - through the operation of the MFN clause of the BIT -the more favorable treatment granted to US investors in the Argentina-US BIT. This BIT contains an \"umbrella clause\" in its Article II(2)(c) which provides that each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\n***The Arbitral Tribunal:***\n----------------------------\n\n173.\n\nAccording to Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, a dispute between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Contracting Party may, on certain conditions, be submitted to arbitration, provided that the dispute arises out of, or relates to, the BIT. Impregilo alleges in this case that its rights under the BIT have been violated in several respects. Argentina objects that all the claims made by Impregilo are contract claims over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.\n\n174.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal thus has to consider whether Impregilo\u2019s claims are treaty claims rather than contractual claims, or in addition to being contractual claims, and, if they are treaty claims, whether Impregilo, according to the terms of the Concession Contract, can be considered to have waived its right to dispute settlement in the form provided for in the BIT. The Tribunal also has to examine whether even contractual claims may fall under the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as a consequence of the MFN clause of the BIT.\n\n175.\n\nAlthough the distinction between contractual claims and treaty claims is not always clear, the Arbitral Tribunal notes in this case that the Concession Contract deals with specific contractual rights and obligations, whereas the BIT concerns rights and obligations of a different nature. Consequently, on the one hand, not all breaches of the Province\u2019s obligations in the Concession Contract would qualify as breaches of the BIT. On the other hand, some acts may involve questions of the implementation of the Concession Contract as well as the observance of Argentina\u2019s obligations under the BIT.\n\n176.\n\nThe distinction between treaty claims and contractual claims has frequently been at issue in ICSID cases. In *Vivendi,* it was pointed out that a particular investment dispute may at the same time involve both issues of the interpretation and application of a treaty and questions of contract. In such cases, the questions as to whether there has been a breach of the treaty and whether there has been a breach of the contract are different questions, and each of them is to be examined separately.64 This statement was relied on by the tribunal in *TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v. Argentina,* which added that, if the contract contains a specific clause on dispute settlement, this does not exclude recourse to the settlement procedure in the treaty, unless there is a clear indication in the contract itself or elsewhere that the parties to the contract intended in such manner to limit the application of the treaty.65\n\n*Vivendi, supra* n. 42, para. 101.\n\n*TSA supra* n.4, para. 58. *See also* *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Poland,* UNCITRAL (*\"Eureko*\"), Partial Award, Aug. 19, 2005, paras. 112-13.\n\n177.\n\nIn any case, as a general rule, a violation of a contract is not a violation of international law. In *Hamester v. Ghana,* the tribunal stated that \"[t]he starting premise is that only the State as a sovereign can be in violation of its international obligations\".66 This principle has been re-stated by many ICSID tribunals. The following citations are examples:\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico:*\n\n\"In the Tribunal\u2019s view, an enterprise is not expropriated just because its debts are not paid or other contractual obligations towards it are breached. There was no outright repudiation of the transaction in the present case, and if the City entered into the Concession Agreement on the basis of an over-optimistic assessment of the possibilities, so did Acaverde. It is not the function of Article 1110 to compensate for failed business ventures, absent arbitrary intervention by the State amounting to a virtual taking or sterilising of the enterprise.\"67\n\n*Joy Machinery Limited v. Egypt:*\n\n\"A basic general distinction can be made between commercial aspects of a dispute and other aspects involving the existence of some forms of State interference with the operation of the contract involved.\"68\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan:*\n\n\"Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority (\"*puissance publique\"**),* and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the investment protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor proves that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the treaty.\"69\n\n*Noble Ventures v. Romania:*\n\n\"The Tribunal recalls the well established rule of general international law that in normal circumstances *per se* a breach of a contract by the State does not give rise to direct international responsibility on the part of the State. This derives from the clear distinction between municipal law on the one hand and international law on the other, two separate legal systems.\"70\n\n*Azurix v. Argentina:*\n\n\"The Tribunal agrees that contractual breaches by a State party or one of its instrumentalities would not normally constitute expropriation. Whether one or series of such breaches can be considered to be measures tantamount to expropriation will depend on whether the State or its instrumentality has breached the contract in the exercise of its sovereign authority, or as a party to a contract.\"71\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v.

That is to say, the breach of such a contract by a State in ordinary commercial intercourse is not, in the predominant view, a violation of international law, but the use of the sovereign authority of a State, contrary to the expectations of the parties, to abrogate or violate a contract with an alien, is a violation of international law....when the State employs its legislative or administrative or executive authority as only a State can employ governmental authority to undo the fundamental expectation on the basis of which parties characteristically contract - performance, not non-performance - then it engages its international responsibility.\"\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v.

Even so, the question arises as to whether these claims, by application of the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT and the umbrella clause in the Argentina-US BIT, may fall under the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n184.\n\nThe substantive protection of the MFN clause is very wide in so far as it relates to all matters regulated by the BIT. Nevertheless, the reference to matters regulated by the BIT sets an outer limit, and it is debatable whether contractual breaches are matters regulated by the BIT.\n\n185.\n\nIt must be observed, however, that all alleged contractual breaches in the present case concern the Concession Contract between AGBA and the Province of Buenos Aires. Consequently, even if the MFN clause could be used to include contractual matters, there would not in this case be any such matter involving Impregilo as a party to a contract, and there would clearly be no basis in the BIT for examining whether the Province had violated its contractual obligations vis-\u00e0-vis AGBA, since AGBA is not an investor protected under the BIT.\n\n186.\n\nIt follows that the question of whether the MFN clause in combination with the umbrella clause could entitle the Tribunal to examine contractual issues is in this case an entirely theoretical question since there would be no contractual issues to be considered between Argentina and Impregilo.\n\n187.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore finds it unnecessary to express an opinion on whether an extension to contractual issues on the basis of a combination of the MFN clause and the umbrella clause would be justified in other circumstances.\n\n188.\n\nAt the same time, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot accept Argentina\u2019s argument that all the claims made by Impregilo are contract claims over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. In fact, Impregilo argues that its investment was expropriated and was subject to unfair treatment, these being clearly issues under the BIT and not exclusively contractual claims.\n\n189.\n\nConsequently, Argentina\u2019s third jurisdictional objection shall be upheld but only to the extent that contractual breaches, which do not at the same time involve violations of Argentina\u2019s obligations to investors under the BIT, are concerned.\n\n**V. MERITS OF THE CASE**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. Requests for relief**\n--------------------------\n\n190.\n\nImpregilo requests:\n\n(a) a declaration that Argentina has violated the Argentina-Italy BIT and international law with respect to Impregilo\u2019s investments,\n\n(b) an order that Argentina pay compensation to Impregilo for all damages it has suffered plus compound interest until the day of full payment, and\n\n(c) an order that Argentina pay the costs for the proceedings, including the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses and the costs of Impregilo\u2019s representation, subject to compound interest until the day of full payment.\n\n191.\n\nThe Argentine Republic requests that Impregilo\u2019s claim against the Argentine Republic be dismissed and Impregilo be ordered to pay for all the expenses and costs arising out of the arbitral proceeding.\n\n**B. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n192.\n\nImpregilo argues that the Argentine Government:\n\n(a) directly expropriated or nationalized its investment in AGBA without any compensation,\n\n(b) failed to treat Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA fairly and equitably,\n\n(c) impaired by unjustified and discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA,\n\n(d) failed to provide full protection and security to Impregilo\u2019s investments in AGBA, and\n\n(e) violated specific obligations entered into with respect to Impregilo\u2019s investments in AGBA.\n\n193.\n\nThe Argentine Republic contests all these allegations.\n\n194.\n\nThe Parties have presented the following main arguments.\n\n***Impregilo:***\n----------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Concession Contract and the Regulatory Framework provided strong protection and guarantees to the investment. The four principal guarantees were: *(i)* protection against devaluation and inflation, addressed by having tariffs in US dollars; *(ii)* guarantees against unilateral changes to the tariff regime; *(iii)* agreements that the tariffs would cover costs, plus a reasonable rate of return; and *(iv)* assurances that the economic equation of the contract would not be unilaterally changed without full and integral compensation.\n\n196.\n\nShortly after AGBA took over the Concession Contract, the Province began to repudiate its commitments and obligations, preventing AGBA from generating the revenues it had expected to allow implementation of the work program required under the Concession Contract.\n\n197.\n\nDuring the 1999 bidding process, the Province committed to deliver three waste treatment plants (the *\"UNIREC plants\")* for the handling of effluents in what would be AGBA\u2019s concession area. It promised that the UNIREC plants would be operational by 2001. AGBA relied on the timely entry into operation of these treatment plants. Without them, AGBA could not expand the sewage network to new areas, nor connect additional customers in areas already served. However, the Province completed the plants only after it had nationalized AGBA\u2019s concession in 2006.\n\n198.\n\nThe Province and ORAB purposely delayed or refused AGBA\u2019s requests to update the categorizations of AGBA\u2019s customers. Soon after taking over the concession, AGBA sought to recategorize non-metered customers who had made improvements to their properties. Although AGBA had received the official updated customers database during the bidding process, ORAB prevented the recategorization of customers until it could verily each customer\u2019s property valuation, which it never did. In addition, the customer database provided by the Province contained severe inconsistencies and errors.\n\n199.\n\nFurthermore, the Concession Contract and the Regulatory Framework provided that prices for non-metered customers would be based on the Province\u2019s 1958 Valuation methodology. The 1958 valuation had assessed values for the real estate in the concession area, and therefore, it was crucial for calculating the price to be paid by non-metered customers. However, the Valuation methodology was not compatible with the AGOSBA customers\u2019 database provided to the bidders during the tender. At the same time, after AGBA took over the Concession Contract, the Province tried to increase its real estate tax collection, updating the 1958 Valuation methodology to the so-called 2000 Valuation methodology. The 2000 Valuation methodology improved the compatibility issues with AGOSBA\u2019s customer database. AGBA sought to use this more up-to-date and compatible Valuation methodology to assess the non-metered property for new parcels of real estate or those with new construction. In preventing AGBA from using the more updated and compatible Valuation methodology, ORAB hampered AGBA\u2019s expected revenues.\n\n200.\n\nORAB and the Province also unilaterally altered the Regulatory Framework by\n\n*(i)* denying AGBA\u2019s right to collect \"work charges\" for some new connections, and\n\n*(ii)* preventing AGBA from applying the 2001 coefficient for water and sewage services. ORAB delayed and eventually prohibited AGBA from applying the incremental sewage charge coefficient beyond the first year.\n\n201.\n\nThe Province\u2019s conduct was motivated by a political and populist desire to prevent any increases in water and sewage bills. Elected provincial officials were not willing to accept any increase in customers\u2019 water and sewage bills and made no effort to accommodate AGBA\u2019s contractual rights to effect increases, even though its conduct was detrimental to AGBA\u2019s investment and work plans under the Concession Contract. The Province\u2019s action damaged AGBA and its shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain the financing needed to comply with its own commitments under the works and investment plan.\n\n202.\n\nThe Province\u2019s regulatory behavior went from bad to worse in early 2002. In January 2002, the Federal Government and the Province enacted emergency legislation depriving AGBA of fundamental contract and legal rights. First, on January 6, 2002, the Federal Government enacted the Federal Emergency Law No. 25,561 (the *\"Federal Emergency Law\").* The most destructive part of this Law was the elimination from public utilities concessions agreements of the right to calculate tariffs in US dollars. Instead, the peso was devalued at an artificial rate, which was later worsened when the Government let the peso float. Six days after the Federal Congress passed the Federal Emergency Law, ORAB followed the Federal Government and issued Resolution 4/2002 \"pesifyng\" and freezing AGBA\u2019s tariffs. This Resolution was later confirmed by the Province\u2019s Law No. 12,858 (the *\"Provincial Emergency Law\").* Thus, like the Federal Government, the Province eliminated the Concession Contract\u2019s right to calculate tariffs in US dollars and express them in pesos at the current exchange rate on the billing date. This had the effect of reducing AGBA\u2019s revenues by two-thirds.\n\n203.\n\nAt the same time, the Province required AGBA to observe all their contractual and regulatory obligations and forced AGBA to participate in a renegotiation process that was supposed to bring the Concession Contract\u2019s economics back into balance. This, however, was the beginning of the end for AGBA, and for Impregilo\u2019s investment.\n\n204.\n\nFirst, the Provincial Emergency Law brought any potential investment and financing in AGBA to a halt, and the Concession Contract was literally finished. Second, the Province\u2019s mandated renegotiation process was a failure.\n\n205.\n\nBy 2002, the majority of the Province\u2019s water and sewerage sector was back under the Province\u2019s control. Some concession areas had been taken over by the recently created state-owned company ABSA, and the Province favored its own company ABSA, in prejudice to the small and privately-owned AGBA.\n\n206.\n\nWhile the Province funded ABSA with millions of dollars in fresh cash in 2003, including a promise to raise its tariffs by 30%, that was to become effective in 2005, it ignored AGBA\u2019s request to re-introduce balance to the Concession Contract\u2019s economic equation. The Province also started launching work plans in ABSA\u2019s concession area, all financed with the support of the Province. This was not just clear discriminatory behavior against AGBA, but it showed that the Province was unwilling to keep a private operator in its water and sewerage sector.\n\n207.\n\nIn mid 2003, the Province made clear its decision to wipe out Impregilo\u2019s investment in AGBA by dismantling the Concession Contract and the Regulatory Framework. By means of an Executive Decree of June 9, 2003, the Provincial Governor repealed the law that in 1996 had approved the Regulatory Framework, dismantling the main protections and guarantees offered by the Province during the privatization in 1999. The Governor\u2019s decree created new rules that radically departed from the guarantees of the Concession Contract and the Regulatory Framework approved in 1996.\n\n208.\n\nFirst, while the Concession Contract specified that tariffs would be calculated in accordance with the economic cost of providing the service, the new regulatory regime based tariffs on customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Second, AGBA would no longer be the exclusive provider in its concession area. Third, the investments in the concession area would be chosen and implemented by the Province, not AGBA. Fourth, AGBA would not be entitled to charge a connection or work fee for new customers or connections. AGBA would also lose its right to cut off service to delinquent customers.\n\n209.\n\nFinally, in July 2006, the Province terminated the Concession Contract, leaving no private operator in the Province and City of Buenos Aires. As motivation, the Province alleged that AGBA had failed to comply with its obligations under the Concession Contract. This allegation was without merit. In fact, any failure of AGBA to comply with the investment plan was the result of the Province\u2019s various breaches of its commitments in the Regulatory Framework and the Concession Contract. The Province, not AGBA, broke the rules of the concession by abrogating fundamental guarantees under the contract, and particularly by undermining the possibility of the investment\u2019s success by its actions in January 2002. The termination of AGBA\u2019s Concession Contract was nothing more than the culmination of the Province\u2019s and Federal Government\u2019s political desire to retake control of the water and sewerage sector.\n\n***The Argentine Republic:***\n-----------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe measures challenged by Impregilo in this arbitration are general measures adopted by the Argentine Republic and the Province of Buenos Aires in the context of a systematic and serious crisis. These measures violate neither the Argentina-Italy BIT nor international law. They had to be adopted within the context of the collapse caused by the worst economic, political and social crisis ever experienced by the Argentine Republic. They affected all the inhabitants of the Argentine Republic in the same way, whether nationals or foreigners, and were aimed at making it possible for the economy to be restructured, thus preventing all economic activities from becoming unfeasible.\n\n211.\n\nImpregilo seeks to hide behind the emergency measures adopted by Argentina and by the Province in order to explain the failure of AGBA\u2019s concession. Such failure was the result of the high risks assumed by Impregilo, the bad business choices it made and its poor performance throughout the term of the concession.\n\n212.\n\nImpregilo, through AGBA, voluntarily invested in one of the most impecunious regions in the Province, with a high poverty rate and a low number of inhabitants with access to the water network (an average of 35.4%) and to the sewer network (an average of 13.4%) as well as a high uncollectability rate (37% of the users failed to pay their bills in 1999). The consortium of which Impregilo was a part knew (or should have known) about the characteristics of the region.\n\n213.\n\nAn example of how unattractive this area was for investors is the fact that the bidding process for the region was cancelled because no bids were submitted in the first call and, during the second call for bids, the only party to submit a bid was the consortium of which Impregilo is a part, which was awarded the concession in exchange for the payment of a USD 1.26 million fee.\n\n214.\n\nAGBA undertook to implement a strong investment and works program during the first five years, by means of a POES which it presented and which was approved by the Province.\n\n215.\n\nAGBA had undertaken to invest USD 230 million during the first five years as well as to achieve the aim that, by the year 2004, 74% of the people would be connected to the water network and 55% would be connected to the sewer network. The concessionaire had further undertaken to build two sewer treatment plants and to restore five existing treatment plants.\n\n216.\n\nIn spite of AGBA\u2019s commitments, soon after the beginning of the concession there were clear signs that AGBA would not fulfill its obligations. In May 2001, prior to the emergency measures, AGBA requested that the Concession Contract be renegotiated and its obligations be suspended, claiming as a reason the high uncollectability rate and its difficulties in obtaining financing. These were two risks that had been voluntarily assumed by AGBA as concessionaire.\n\n217.\n\nTwo months thereafter, AGBA reiterated its request for renegotiation and suspension of the POES, but this time it claimed as a reason the economic crisis that had already begun to strike the Argentine Republic. Through this second request, AGBA intended to hide its actual management problems related to collectability and financing.\n\n218.\n\nFurthermore, AGBA sought to justify its breaches in the implementation of the POES by claiming the failure of the Provincial Executing Unit *(\"UNIREC\")* to build two treatment plants and to expand and restore another existing plant. However, the sewer connections that poured water into such plants amounted to merely 34.7% of all the connections to be made by AGBA during the first five years and they only applied to certain districts and not to the rest of the area subject to the concession.\n\n219.\n\nBetween December 2001 and January 2002, the Argentine crisis reached its peak. In January 2002, the Argentine Federal Government enacted the Argentine Emergency Law and, little thereafter, the Province enacted a similar law for the provincial context. One of the first measures to be applied to public utility contracts both at a national and at a provincial level was the removal of the systems for calculating rates in US dollars because those systems were tied to the existence of the convertibility regime that had been applied in Argentina between 1991 and 2001.\n\n220.\n\nIn the case of AGBA, this measure became especially important due to the fact that, because of the characteristics of the area in which the company provided the service, an increase in rates of at least 200% would have been impossible to pay. In addition, due to the serious collectability problems derived from AGBA\u2019s inefficiency, such an increase would only have worsened its situation.\n\n221.\n\nIn this context, in a spirit of goodwill for the purpose of securing the continuance of AGBA\u2019s concession, the Province declared that the goals of the POES for the first year of the concession, *i.e.* 2000, had been attained, although AGBA had not reached the expansion goals set forth for that year. In yet another display of goodwill, the Province suspended the company\u2019s obligations with respect to the second year of the concession, *i.e.* 2001, when there were already signs that the company would not be able to achieve the goals set forth for that period. As from that moment, and in order to make the process for renegotiating the contract with AGBA easier, the Province refrained from taking measures against the company in spite of its continuous breaches.\n\n222.\n\nIn response to the existing situation, the Province enacted a New Regulatory Framework and made room for an opportunity to improve the contract with AGBA by maintaining the principles of the previous framework and including essential tools for making the renegotiation easier. Such framework was invoked on several occasions by AGBA in order to benefit from its application.\n\n223.\n\nThe renegotiation process failed through the exclusive fault of AGBA which demanded, among other things, an excessive 93% rate increase as well as being exempted from any investment in the area subject to the concession.\n\n224.\n\nAGBA threatened the Province with terminating the Concession Contract through the fault of the Province if it did not satisfy its demands within 45 days. It invoked as proof of AGBA\u2019s fulfillment of its obligations that no measures had been taken against AGBA, although this was not due to the fact that there were no breaches but to the Province\u2019s will not to affect the provision of the public service. This situation left the Province with no choice but to terminate the Concession Contract due to AGBA\u2019s flagrant breaches in the six years of duration of the concession. In order to terminate the Concession Contract, the Province followed the procedures and applied the grounds provided for therein. AGBA filed a complaint against the termination decree before the administrative courts for the city of La Plata and reserved the right to claim damages.\n\n225.\n\nThe Argentine Republic cannot be held liable for the risks assumed by Impregilo and for AGBA\u2019s poor management. In any case, even if these circumstances were not present in the case, the measures taken by the Argentine Republic and by the Province were not contrary to the BIT, to customary international law or to Argentine law.\n\n226.\n\nImpregilo\u2019s claim for damages rests upon a calculation of the income it would have obtained if it had made investments it never actually made, funded with loans it was never granted, because of a wrong business assessment based on optimistic and incorrect financial projections, due to business risks that the company did not take into account in evaluating the business opportunity. In any case, the measures challenged by Impregilo did not cause any damage to its investment, since the net value of such investment was extremely negative when the measures were adopted.\n\n227.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has accorded fair and equitable treatment to Impregilo\u2019s investment at all times in accordance with the BIT and international law. The measures challenged by Impregilo are general in nature and bear no discriminatory feature at all. In fact, the domestic and foreign investors who were in similar situations received exactly the same treatment.\n\n228.\n\nThe measures adopted did not amount to expropriatory acts in violation of the BIT or of international law, and there was no significant deprivation of property. In addition, the regulatory actions taken by the Province and Argentina were lawful and proportionate. In this case, the regulatory powers of the State were particularly important in order to guarantee its inhabitants the human right to water.\n\n229.\n\nThe rules adopted by the Argentine Republic were not arbitrary. In the face of the acute crisis, the Argentine Republic and the Province took a series of measures that were fully justified by the need to reduce as much as possible its effects on the country in general and on investments in particular.\n\n230.\n\nOn the other hand, the obligations assumed by the Argentine Republic as regards investments do not prevail over the obligations assumed in treaties on human rights. Therefore, the obligations arising from the BIT must not be construed separately but in accordance with the rules on protection of human rights. Treaties on human rights providing for the human right to water must be especially taken into account in this case.\n\n231.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the Argentine Republic did not breach any treaty provision, the measures challenged are protected under Article 4 of the BIT and under the concept of the state of necessity provided for in international law. The adoption of such measures was the only viable alternative to prevent the disappearance of the Argentine State.\n\n**C. The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s reasoning**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Concession Contract**\n-------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Concession Contract was concluded on December 7, 1999. It conferred on AGBA as concessionaire a number of rights and obligations which were set out in the Regulatory Framework as well as in the Contract itself. Article 3.2 of the Contract provided that AGBA should, in particular, \"perform all tasks related to service provision required under the applicable laws to guarantee effective supply to Users, the protection of public health and the rational use of resources\".\n\n233.\n\nAccording to Article 3.3, the drinking water supply and the sewerage service should be expanded according to the POES and Five-Year Plans which were to be part of the Contract and binding on AGBA.\n\n234.\n\nThe POES (Annex F to the Contract) provided that AGBA should expand the drinking water and sewerage services and accomplish for each region certain specified goals. The drinking water and sewerage networks should be expanded during the first two years with a certain number of new connections, specified per district, and the expansion should continue with a substantial further increase as from the third year. In Article 1.8 of the Concession Contract, AGBA undertook to make all the investments required to implement the POES.\n\n235.\n\nIn return, AGBA was given various rights and guarantees in the Concession Contract. According to Article 1.6 of the Concession Contract, AGBA should enjoy an exclusive right to provide the Service within the Concession Area, subject to the Regulatory Framework and certain provisions in the Contract itself. According to Article 3.5, property owners would be under a duty to connect to the water network by paying the applicable fee for connection to the mains to AGBA. They would also be under a duty to pay for the Service pursuant to the applicable tariff regime even if the property had no connection to external Service networks. Nonetheless, this provision should not apply to vacant properties if there had been a request for nonconnection or Service disconnection, which should be subject to the charges established in the Tariff Regime for those special cases.\n\n236.\n\nThe tariff system was dealt with in Annex \u00d1 to the Concession Contract. It provided for the prices to be paid by the Users to AGBA, for work fees and connection fees that users should pay when being connected to drinking water and sewerage services and also allowed AGBA to interrupt its services on certain conditions where users were late in paying their bills.\n\n237.\n\nThe term of the concession was 30 years and the first year of operation was 2000.\n\n**(ii) Impregilo\u2019s Investment**\n-------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nImpregilo owns 42.58 percent of AGBA\u2019s stock and made a USD 21.3 million equity investment in AGBA. In the present proceedings, Impregilo has, to a large extent, claimed violation of rights belonging to AGBA and can therefore be considered to have implicitly considered AGBA\u2019s rights as protected investments.\n\n239.\n\nIt should be pointed out that AGBA is an Argentine company, as it is incorporated under the laws of Argentina and registered in Argentina.\n\n240.\n\nIn its Article 25(2), the ICSID Convention gives a definition of the companies that can be considered as nationals of a given State:\n\n\"(2) \u2018National of another Contracting State\u2019 means:\n\n\u2026\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"\n\n241.\n\nIn the BIT, Article 1 gives the following definition of the expression \"legal entity\":\n\n\"\u2019legal entity\u2019 means, in respect of each one of the Contracting Parties, any entity established and recognized under the laws of a Contracting Party, having its seat in the territory of that Party, such as a public entity engaged in economic activities, partnerships or corporations, foundations and associations, whether with limited or unlimited liability.\"\n\n242.\n\nIt follows that AGBA is not a protected investor under the BIT. Nor is AGBA a legal entity which, because of foreign control, the Contracting States have agreed should be treated as an Italian national whose rights should be protected investments for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and this arbitration.\n\n243.\n\nA similar situation existed in *CMS v. Argentina* in which the tribunal stated as follows:\n\n\"In [the Tribunal\u2019s] view, while the acquisition of shares qualifies as an investment under the Treaty, neither TGN, as an Argentine corporation, nor the License qualify as an investment under the BIT. TCN, the argument follows, has its own assets, including the License; because these assets do not constitute an investment under the Treaty, CMS\u2019s claims, based on the alleged breach of TGN\u2019s rights under the License cannot be considered to arise directly from an investment.\"72\n\n*CMS, supra* n.35, July 17, 2003, para. 66.\n\n244.\n\nThe *CMS* tribunal accepted jurisdiction, not on the basis of any rights of the Argentine company TGN or any rights relating to the License, which were not protected investments, but on account of the existence of the shareholding of CMS in the Argentine company:\n\n\"The Tribunal [...] finds no bar in current international law to the concept of allowing claims to shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned, not even if those shareholders are minority or non-controlling shareholders.\n\n\u2026\n\nBecause...the rights of the Claimant can be asserted independently from the rights of TGN and those relating to the License, and because the Claimant has a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the protected investment, the Tribunal concludes that the present dispute arises directly from the investment made and that therefore there is no bar to the exercise of jurisdiction on this count.\"73\n\n*Id.* paras. 48 and 68.\n\n245.\n\nSimilarly, AGBA does not qualify as a protected investor under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and its contractual rights cannot be considered protected investments. On the other hand, Impregilo\u2019s shares in AGBA were an investment protected under the BIT. Reference may be made here to the *Suez* cases and the following quotation from one of these cases:\n\n\"The Claimants, as shareholders in AASA, had an indirect interest in the Concession to operate the water and sewage system of Buenos Aires for a period of thirty years....AASA as holder of the Concession had only a legal right to receive a stream of revenue from the operation of the system for a period of time.... As shareholders in AASA, the Claimants had an indirect interest in those same rights. Company shares are considered \"investments\" under the Argentina-France BIT (Article 1 (b)), the Argentina-Spain BIT (Article 1(b)(2), and the Argentina-U.K. BIT (Article l(a)(ii)). The economic value of such shares would be directly affected by any action taken against the assets of AASA. Thus, the Claimants had investments capable of protection from expropriation.\"74\n\n***Suez II,*** Decision on Liability, July 30, 2010, para. 130.\n\n246.\n\nConsequently, the protected investment in this case is Impregilo\u2019s shareholding in AGBA. This does not exclude that measures primarily taken in regard to AGBA may also affect Impregilo\u2019s investment.\n\n**(iii) AGBA\u2019s performance and the termination of the Concession Contract**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIn a letter of May 17, 2001, AGBA told the Minister of Public Works and Services of the Province of Buenos Aires that it had experienced considerable difficulties in receiving payment from users for its Services and that this had affected its capacity to make the investments required under the expansion program. As AGBA had not obtained bank loans, it had also been impossible to achieve the goals of the Five-Year Plan. AGBA therefore made the following request:\n\n\"During the 16 months it has been providing the service, AGBA has clearly shown its capacity to perform the Concession Contract in an efficient manner as regards all matters within its reasonable control. The abovementioned problems exceed such scope and therefore make it necessary to implement corrective mechanisms to restore the Contract\u2019s equilibrium in order to fulfill its purpose.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and in order to proceed in the shortest time possible, as required by the circumstances, we hereby request that a work commission be created in order to jointly analyze the solutions and alternatives most appropriate for that purpose.\n\nIn addition, we also request, as a provisional measure, that the expansion goals be temporarily suspended until the above commission makes a decision.\n\nFinally, we require that the Granting Authority actively cooperate in the negotiations currently being held with the [Inter-American Development Bank] for funding, in such aspects as may be within the scope of its powers.\"\n\n248.\n\nSoon thereafter, in letters of July 17 and August 15, 2001, AGBA asked ORAB to suspend temporarily the execution of the POES. In these letters, AGBA invoked the serious economic situation. In a letter of September 2001, AGBA referred to \"the serious issues that preclude the normal development of the Concession\" and asked for the Governor\u2019s personal intervention in the matter. In a further letter of December 27, 2001, AGBA requested modifications of the Concession Contract in order to restore the original equilibrium of the Contract. AGBA referred to the unforeseeable and unusual impossibility to collect fees for services in the concession area and to the supervening, exceptional and unforeseeable distortion of financial market conditions that restrained access to credit and prevented compliance with investment plans. AGBA also raised a number of specific issues, such as an abrupt transition to a metered tariff system which violated AGBA\u2019s right to obtain a fair market price for its services, deficiencies in the list of customers and incorrect users\u2019 categorization, the failure of the authorities to provide the UNIREC treatment plants.\n\n249.\n\nIt thus appears that since the end of the first half of 2001 AGBA considered the situation to be such that it could not fulfill its obligations under the Concession Contract and that the Contract therefore had to be amended in AGBA\u2019s favor or other measures had to be taken which would again make the concession a viable enterprise for AGBA. Although AGBA, in the letter of December 27, 2001, complains of the action or inaction of the authorities on specific matters, it would seem that AGBA, at this stage, attributed its difficulties to the economic situation in general and to the difficulties in obtaining payment from customers for AGBA\u2019s services.\n\n250.\n\nHowever, AGBA also referred to a specific reason for some of the collectability difficulties, *i.e.* that there were large numbers of unregistered customers connected to the water network who had not previously paid for the services. In its letter of May 17, 2001, AGBA stated that the difficulties in collecting fees for the services had been seriously aggravated by the incorporation of 80,000 users who had not been included in AGOSBA\u2019s list of customers and who had a non-collection rate of 70% or even 80% in some neighborhoods. These users had never before been charged for the investment or the services which explained their reluctance to pay.\n\n251.\n\nIt is unclear whether the existence of this large group of users who had not been billed for the services provided for them had been brought to AGBA\u2019s attention before the Concession Contract was concluded. In any case, the Argentine Republic has not adduced any convincing evidence showing that AGBA had been duly informed, and the Arbitral Tribunal therefore accepts that in this regard the Argentine Republic was to some extent responsible for the unexpected problems that arose for AGBA and made it considerably more difficult for AGBA to attain the collectability goals it had set up.\n\n252.\n\nHowever, this does not wholly explain AGBA\u2019s inability to fulfill its obligations according to the POES and the first Five-Year plan as regards investments and expansion of water and sewage services.\n\n253.\n\nNevertheless, during the first period of the concession, the Argentine authorities showed a considerable degree of indulgence and tolerance towards any deficiencies that existed in AGBA\u2019s performance. On August 27, 2001, ORAB\u2019s Technical Department declared that AGBA\u2019s performance during the first year of the concession had shown an acceptable degree of compliance with the POES. The Technical Department also supported the request for a suspension of the POES in view of the economic hardship facing the Province and the country. Subsequently, a favorable opinion was also given by ORAB\u2019s Economic Regulation Department on November 23, 2001 and by ORAB\u2019s Law and Resolution Department on December 3, 2001. Even one year later, on December 2, 2002, the Technical Department of ORAB, in a Report to the President of ORAB, declared that AGBA had essentially satisfied the goals established for the first concession year 2000.\n\n254.\n\nFinally, in Resolution No. 69/02 of December 5, 2002, the Board of Directors of ORAB, representing the Province, found as follows:\n\n\"It may be inferred from the analysis performed that the Concessionaire met the service expansion and quality goals undertaken for the first year of the concession, as described in Annex F to the Concession Contract....\n\nWith respect to the expansion goals set in connection with the drinking water and wastewater services, it must be noted that the minimum number of connections for region B indicated in Articles 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 of Annex F to the Concession Contract has been met.\n\nIn this respect, the Concessionaire made 46,588 new drinking water connections, in excess of the 26,500 connections scheduled for year one of the concession (Article 2.1 of Annex F). The Concessionaire also made 15,380 wastewater connections.\n\nAlthough an expansion goal of the Concession Contract consisted in putting 26,000 new wastewater connections in operation throughout the region, it should be noted that the wastewater treatment plants were not available during that period to treat the wastewater flowing from those connections, which prevented the Concessionaire from connecting new users to the service and from putting those connections in operation.\n\nNevertheless, it should be highlighted that the purpose behind the expansion goals set forth in the Contract is to release the service for its use and therefore increase the number of users served, from whom the Concessionaire may recover the investment made in the expansion.\n\nThe fact that the Concessionaire was prevented from operating the treatment plants was the reason why not all wastewater connections provided for in Annex F were made, given that it is not possible to release the wastewater service for its use without previously treating the effluents collected, a situation which could pose a threat to the health of the population and the environment which must be protected by the Regulatory Agency.\n\nIt was determined that in order to replace and recondition the drinking water connections, the Concessionaire made connections along 13,200 meters, which represents 3.2% of the total length, and renewed and/or reconditioned 17,200 meters of wastewater piping, which represents 2.7% of the total length.\n\nPursuant to Article 2.3 of Annex F to the Concession Contract, on the basis of the percentages undertaken with respect to the annual renewal and/or reconditioning of drinking water and wastewater piping, the foregoing implies that the Concessionaire has met the annual percentage undertaken in Annex F to the Concession Contract....\n\nIn addition, the Concessionaire has fulfilled the service quality goals, as evidenced by the report issued by the Service Quality Division and recorded on page 431 of the case-file, which expressly provides that '*It is hereby informed that, during the first year of the concession, the quality of the water*  *provided for consumption in concession area No. 2 and the discharge of wastewater effluents from the treatment plants related to the concession services meet the parameters set forth in the Contract (Annexes C and D).'\"*\n\n255.\n\nThe Board of Directors of ORAB therefore resolved:\n\n\"SECTION 1: That the Annual Report on the Progress of the POES and Service Levels submitted by [AGBA] for year one of the concession, *i.e.* year 2000, be approved on the basis of the foregoing clauses;\n\nSECTION 2: That [AGBA] has met the service expansion and quality goals of the first year of the concession (year 2000), as provided in Annex F to the Concession Contract, which was incorporated into the First Five-Year Plan which is an integral part of the POES approved by Resolution No. 07/01;\"\n\n256.\n\nAs regards the second year of the concession, *i.e.* 2001, AGBA, in a letter of September 13, 2001 to the Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, referred to the serious situation that had arisen in regard to the implementation of the Concession Contract and asked for a meeting to discuss it. On December 27, 2001, AGBA asked the Governor to arrange immediately bilateral negotiations in order to decide on the most suitable mechanisms to restore the equilibrium of the economic and financial equation of the concession, which had been disrupted by various events.\n\n257.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also notes AGBA\u2019s repeated requests in 2001 for a temporary suspension of the execution of the POES. On December 30, 2002, in Resolution No. 77/02, the Board of Directors of ORAB granted AGBA\u2019s request for a suspension (called \"neutralization\") of the POES obligations in the second concession year with the effect that measures which had not been accomplished during that year should not lead to penalties according to Article 13.2.5.5 of the Concession Contract.\n\n258.\n\nAt that time, the implementation of the Concession Contract had been dramatically affected by the emergency legislation enacted in Argentina at the beginning of 2002. On January 6, 2002, the Federal Argentine Government enacted Law No. 25,561 on Public Emergency and Exchange Regime Reform in which utilities contracts were \"pesified\" at parity level and tariffs were frozen. The Government was authorized to renegotiate public utilities contracts. On January 11, 2002, ORAB \"pesified\" AGBA\u2019s tariffs at parity rate. On February 28, 2002, the Province of Buenos Aires adopted certain sections of the Emergency Law as Provincial Law No. 12,858. On August 27, 2002, ORAB, in Resolution No. 56/02, suspended AGBA\u2019s right to interrupt water service to customers who had not paid their bills. On June 9, 2003, by Decree No. 878/03, a New Regulatory Framework for drinking water and wastewater public services in the Province of Buenos Aires was enacted. A request by AGBA to be allowed to make tariff increases was rejected in a letter from the Undersecretary of Public Services on August 25, 2005.\n\n259.\n\nAGBA made various attempts to have the Concession Contract renegotiated and asked for the balance between the parties to be re-established in the new circumstances. However, the position of the authorities seems to have been initially that AGBA had assumed obligations and risks and that there was no reason to change the balance in AGBA\u2019s favor. After the Emergency Law had been enacted, the Province appeared to be prepared in principle to discuss modifications of the Contract. However, it is not clear whether any serious negotiations were conducted, and the Argentine Republic explains the negative result by referring to AGBA\u2019s allegedly excessive demands.\n\n260.\n\nThere was apparently an increasing tension between AGBA and the Province which culminated in 2006 when the new control agency OCABA, created in 2003, issued a report in which it concluded that AGBA had violated in several ways its obligations under the Concession Contract and the POES. In the same year, OCABA also fined AGBA for having failed to handle certain complaints in a timely fashion.\n\n261.\n\nIt may be noted that, in a letter of June 14, 2005 to the Minister and the Undersecretary of Public Services and also to the President of ORAB, AGBA accused the Province of violating its obligations under the Concession Contract and declared that, unless this was corrected within 45 days, AGBA would exercise its rights of termination under the Concession Contract. Finally, on July 11, 2006, the Province Governor, by Decree No. 1666/06, terminated the Concession Contract due to AGBA\u2019s fault pursuant to Article 14.1.3 (a), (b), (h), (i) and (k) of the Concession Contract. In connection therewith, the Governor, by Decree No. 1677/06 of July 13, 2006, transferred AGBA\u2019s water and sewage service concession to the state-owned ABSA which had been created in 2002 and had already taken over the concessions from the concessionaire Azurix in other parts of the Province.\n\n262.\n\nAs reasons for the termination of the Concession Contract, the Province Governor stated in Decree No. 1666/06 (in translation):\n\n\"Whereas, in accordance with Resolution No. 84/06 and within the scope of the Regulatory Framework in force and the Concession Contract, Article 14.1.3 last part, [OCABA] prepared the required report, dated April 11, 2006, indicating the contractual obligations breached by the Concessionaire that fall within the reasons for termination due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault set forth in Article 14.1.3 of the Concession Contract;\n\nWhereas pursuant to said Article [AGBA] is responsible for the following:\n\n1) \"serious non-compliance with legal, contractual or regulatory provisions applicable to the service\" (Article 14.1.3(a));\n\n2) \"repeated and unjustified delays in fulfilling the coverage goals set forth in the POES\" (Article 14.1.3 (b));\n\n3) \"repeated violation of the user regulations provided for in Article 13-II of the Regulatory Framework\" (Article 14.1.3 (h));\n\n4) \"repeatedly withholding or concealing information from the Regulatory Agency\" (Article 14.1.3(i));\n\n5) \"failure to furnish, renew or refurnish the Contract guaranty as provided for in Article 11.2\" (Article 14.1.3 (k));\n\nWhereas [AGBA\u2019s] failure to comply with the POES in a timely manner has been verified, as indicated in the report by OCABA\u2019s Board of Directors issued on the aforementioned date, which unreasonable delays undermine compliance with the proposed service coverage goals and which have occurred at an alarming rate. Thus, such non-compliance has had so negative an impact on service quality and management indicators as to warrant termination due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault under Article 14.1.3 (b) of the Concession Contract;\n\n\u2026\n\nWhereas Resolution No. 69/02 approved the compliance with goals and milestones of the first year of implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, and Resolution No. 77/02 provided that, in relation to the coverage goals for the second year of the concession, *i.e.* those set for the year 2001, the required annulment of the implementation period of the works and expansion program should be granted, and that the percentages that had not been complied with should be adjusted together with the Granting Authority;\n\nWhereas the aforesaid annulment of the POES implementation period for the second year of the concession did not imply setting aside the goals undertaken by the Concessionaire for that year; rather it meant that they should be readjusted in accordance with and under the procedure established by Emergency Law No. 12,858 with the Granting Authority;\n\nWhereas the Chairman of the Board of [ORAB], by means of a communication dated September 11, 2001, submitted for consideration of the Undersecretary of Public Services, pointed out that the request for annulment did in no way imply an exemption from the POES. Thus, he indicated that \"...the Regulatory Agency believes that the determination of the deferral of the Five-Year Plan should only be limited to the coverage goals (expansion works), that the circumstances warrant such deferral and that a period not exceeding 6 months from that required under the Five-Year Plan should be granted to resume the execution of works\". In other words, all coverage goals specified in the aforesaid plan had to be attained by the end of the Five-Year Plan. The Economic Regulation Area of ORAB shared the same opinion;\n\nWhereas when the Board of Directors of ORAB issued the resolution authorizing the annulment of the terms of the POES approved by Resolution 7/01, it expressly pointed out that the expansion and service quality goals for the second year of the First Five-Year Plan should be adjusted together with the Granting Authority within the framework of the utility contract adjustment procedure established by Law No. 12,858 and Decree No. 1175/02...;\n\n\u2026\n\nWhereas it follows that the annulment of the POES implementation period authorized by ORAB did not exempt AGBA from the goals undertaken which had not been attained during the second year of the concession given that they had to be attained in the following years of the Five-Year Plan;\n\nWhereas, regarding specific details of the issues in question, it should be noted that in accordance with Appendix I of Resolution No. 7/01, the Concessionaire undertook to make investments in the amount of eighty-six million six hundred sixty and three thousand seven hundred US dollars for the expansion of the drinking water network, in the districts that comprise the concession area, thereby failing to comply with its obligations, as evidenced by the report prepared by the Regulatory Agency;\n\nWhereas, in the city of Bel\u00e9n de Escobar, even though the company met the percent of population served as specified in the POES, *i.e.* 78.5%, it did not implement the drinking water network in the following areas: Paravi, where 2,740 m. of water pipe and 165 connections to the mains were to be carried out; b) Philips, with 6,300 m. of water pipe and 312 connections to the mains; and c) Ruta 9, with a 4,440-meter water pipe and 311 connections to the mains;\n\nWhereas, in General Rodr\u00edguez District, [AGBA] did not meet the goals specified in the POES insofar as it supplies drinking water to 47.34% of the population even though the company undertook to serve 55.3% of the population;\n\nWhereas failure to meet the specified goals in the aforesaid District was due to non-performance of the following works in the following localities: a) Distribution network in Porte\u00f1o, where 18,750 m. of water pipe of different diameters and 428 connections to the mains were to be completed; b) Distribution network in Irigoyen, where 13,700 m. of water pipe of different diameters and 944 connections to the mains were to be completed; c) Distribution network in Los Viveros, where 13,250 m. of water pipe of different diameters and 447 connections to the mains were to be completed; d) Distribution network in San Martin, where 23,700 m. of water pipe of different diameters and 853 connections to the mains were to be completed; e) Distribution network in Orence, where 9,900 m. of water pipe of different diameters and 262 connections to the mains were to be completed; and f) Distribution network in Ruta 24, where 9,200 m. of water pipe of different diameters and 157 connections to the mains were to be completed;\n\nWhereas, in the District of Jos\u00e9 C. Paz, failure to achieve the goals is notorious given that from 58.2% of the population that [AGBA] was to serve with drinking water, the company only attained 8.82%;\n\nWhereas failure to meet the specified goals in said District was due to non-performance of the following works: a) Catchment works from a battery of twenty-one wells to be located in a catchment area in Moreno District, where a holding tank, the relevant water system of 36,250 m. of water pipe and a 10,000 m3 cistern were to be installed; b) The distribution networks amount to 209,000 m. of water pipe of different diameters, with 23,900 connections to the mains;\n\nWhereas, in Malvinas Argentinas District, service provision to new users has practically not been complied with given that only 5.29% of the population has been served with water even though the obligation of [AGBA] under the POES was to serve 67.2% of the population;\n\nWhereas in said District the following works have not been carried out: a) Basic Works and activation of Grand Bourg Sur, which included eleven bores near the Acceso Norte, 16,300 m. of discharge pipe, one holding tank, two treatment tanks, two cisterns, two pumping systems for network distribution; and b) A distribution network of 41,710 m. of water pipe, with 6,000 connections to the mains;\n\nWhereas, in Merlo District, the goals of the Concessionaire under the POES were to serve 83.1% of the population; however, the Concessionaire only served 46.44% of the population;\n\nWhereas failure to meet the goals in said District was due to non-performance of the following works: a) Basis catchment works in Libertad, which include twenty-six bores to be located in the rural area, west of the District and near Marcos Paz, where, in addition, a holding tank, a water line extending up to Libertad and a 10,000 m3 cistern were to be built. The discharge pipe will be 27,600 m. long; b) With respect to the distribution network which should have been built by the end of the first five-year period, 2386,300 m. of water pipe and 34,269 connections to the mains were to be installed for the first two stages; c) Merlo Norte distribution network, including 52,100 m. of water pipe and 7,150 connections to the mains;\n\nWhereas, in Moreno District, the report by the Water Regulatory Agency expressly states that [AGBA] did not comply with the goals undertaken under the POES, insofar as from 81.1% of the population to be served, it only covered 42.73%;\n\nWhereas in that District the following works were not carried out: a) Basic and distributions works in La Reja, La Reja Grande and Francisco Alvarez, including a battery of eight wells to be located in a catchment area, southwest of the District, near Ingeniero Roggero dam, 3,600 m. of discharge pipe and a 1,000 m3 tank; b) Distribution networks and connections to the mains: La Reja: 54,200 m. and 3,058 connections to the mains, La Reja Grande: 14,450 m. of water pipe and 3,136 connections to the mains; Expansion of the distribution network in Trujuy, including a battery of twelve wells west of the area to be served, near Mariano Momeo airdrome and a 10,150 m. discharge pipe; the distribution was projected from the tank of Trujuy, with a 86,200 m. long water pipe and 9,913 connection to the mains; and c) Works in Lomas de Maril\u00f3 which share the production from the aforementioned battery and the distribution network to be executed included 60,700 m. of water pipe and 5,502 connections to the mains;\n\nWhereas, in San Miguel District, according to the report provided by the Water Regulatory Agency, the goals set in the POES were not complied with given that only 45.11% out of the 74.5% of the population to be served with drinking water, was provided with water;\n\nWhereas failure to meet the goals in said District was due to non-performance of the following works: a) Basic and distribution works for Bella Vista and Mu\u00f1iz, including thirteen bores in a catchment area near the west of Bella Vista, construction of a 1,000 m3 tank, 7,865 m. of discharge pipe, 164,000 m. of distribution pipe of different diameters and 15,638 connections to the mains; b) Basic and distribution works for expansion in Santa Brigida, including two bores, 150 m. of discharge pipe, 18,650 m. of distribution pipe and 2,395 connections to the mains;\n\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that [AGBA] only complied with the drinking water supply expansion goals in Escobar District, even though it did not fully perform the works it had undertaken to carry out, and, with respect to the other Districts mentioned above, failure to comply with the POES is apparent insofar as none of the drinking water supply service expansion goals have been met;\n\n\u2026\n\nWhereas Annex F of the Concession Contract also establishes that, at the end of the fifth year of the concession, the coverage percentage of users with micro-measurement was to be 40%; however, the Concessionaire, according to the report of the Water Regulatory Agency, has completely failed to comply with such goals as it did not install almost any water consumption meter;\n\nWhereas the Concessionaire did not comply with Resolution No. 21/04 either, issued in proceedings No. 2430-506/04, whereby the company is ordered to install a specific number of micrometers;\n\n\u2026\n\nWhereas, consequently, it has been shown that the Concessionaire has not complied with the micro-measurement goals insofar as it has failed to install meters so that at the end of the fifth year of the concession the service billing system could be 40% based on consumption measurement, thus maintaining the flat rate billing system or non-metered system;\n\nWhereas, in accordance with Resolution No. 7/01, the Concessionaire undertook to make investments in the amount of one hundred forty-four million two hundred fifty-three thousand and six hundred US dollars for the expansion of the sewer network in different districts within the concession area, for which purposes the Concessionaire was to carry out the works described in the Annex to said administrative action;\n\nWhereas, in the city of Bel\u00e9n de Escobar, the Concessionaire met the goals set in the POES but failed to expand the sewer network in the area located east of the sewage treatment plant, which involves around three hundred connections to the mains;\n\nWhere, furthermore, [AGBA] had to build a new module for the sewage treatment plant to service fifteen thousand residents, which work was never carried out and, therefore, at the end of the first five-year period, the percentage of served population reached 56%;\n\nWhereas, in General Rodr\u00edguez District, in order to comply with the goals set in the POES, *i.e.*  to serve 43.4% of the population with sewerage, the sewer network should have been expanded in the following localities: los Viveros, La Armon\u00eda, Solidaridad I, Rafa and Casco Chico, with six hundred connections to the mains;\n\nWhereas, in addition, a new module for the sewage treatment plant to service fifteen thousand residents was to be constructed, which work was never carried out by the Concessionaire and, therefore, at the end of the first five-year period, the percentage of served population was 42.01%;\n\nWhereas, in Jos\u00e9 C. Paz District, the supplier did not perform any of the works undertaken, thereby failing to comply with all its investment obligations;\n\nWhereas the Concessionaire should have built a sewage treatment plant on Pinazo stream with an initial capacity to serve one hundred thousand residents, to receive sewage effluents from Jos\u00e9 C. Paz Sur, conducted through a main sewage collector which would receive the effluents from the sewage main networks to be installed;\n\nWhereas, in Jos\u00e9 C. Paz Norte, the Concessionaire did not build the network that was to connect with the sewerage system of Malvinas Argentinas District either;\n\nWhereas, because the Concessionaire did not perform any of the works undertaken, the percentage of served population in this locality equals 0%, which entails a complete and utter failure to comply with the POES;\n\nWhereas, in Malvinas Argentinas District, [AGBA] did not perform any of the works it was required to carry out according to the goals established in the POES regarding the provision of sewerage service to 40.9% of the population in said District;\n\nWhereas, in the aforementioned District, the Concessionaire was required to build the first module of the sewage treatment plant on Claro stream with a treatment capacity to serve one hundred sixty-five thousand residents; a network of connections to the mains and main sewage collectors in order to comply with the stipulated served area percentage and the works designed to conduct sewage effluents from Jos\u00e9 C. Paz Norte;\n\nWhereas, as a result of such non-performance, the percentage of served population is the District equals 0%, which entails a complete failure to meet the expansion goals set out in the POES;\n\nWhereas, in Merlo District, the Concessionaire undertook to extend the sewerage supply service to 58.8% of the population, for which purposes it was required to perform the following works: a) Network of connections to the sewage mains in San Martin and main sewage collectors; b) Expansion of the network of connection pipes to the sewage mains in Libertad and main sewage collectors;\n\nWhereas, in relation to connections to the mains, in order to meet the goals established in the POES the Concessionaire had to install seventy-eight thousand five hundred connections, of which forty-six thousand connections were not installed;\n\nWhereas, with respect to sewage liquid treatment in Libertad, the treatment capacity of the sewage treatment plant had to be expanded in order to serve ninety thousand residents;\n\nWhereas, even though the POES required a service coverage of 58.8% of the residents of said District, at the end of the first five-year period the service was provided to only 23.77% of the population;\n\nWhereas, in Moreno District, the Concessionaire did not perform the following works: a) Expansion of the networks of connection pipes to the sewage mains in La Perlita, Villa Anita and Moreno 2000 with 148,400 m., the relevant main sewage collector and 14,900 connections to the mains; b) Expansion of the network in Trujuy and Paso del Rey, with 130,000 m. of connection pipes to the sewage mains, 12,800 connections to the mains and a pump station to serve 13,000 residents;\n\nWhereas the percentage of served population by the end of the first five-year period was 20.96% even though the Concessionaire was required under the contract to serve 57.8% of the residents of said District;\n\nWhereas, in San Miguel District, [AGBA] should have performed expansion works in relation to network connections, main sewage collectors and nineteen thousand two hundred connections to the mains in order to complete the thirty-three thousand three hundred and ninety-three stipulated in the Expansion Work Five-Year Plan, and it failed to comply with the goals established in the POES as well;\n\nWhereas, based on the foregoing, [AGBA] also failed to comply with the expansion goals regarding the sewage service;\"\n\n263.\n\nAfter a further account of matters in regard to which AGBA had not fulfilled its obligations, the Resolution stated:\n\n\"Whereas the foregoing entails a serious, repeated and systematic breach of contract, given that AGBA has failed to comply with most of the expansion works in connection with the drinking water and sewerage supply service, as stipulated in Annex F to the Concession Contract;\n\nWhereas, in particular, the Concessionaire\u2019s failure to perform any of the sewage works undertaken constitutes a gross and flagrant violation, as a result of which the percentage of served population is 0%, which implies a complete and utter non-compliance with the POES in this regard;\n\nWhereas, with respect to service quality standards, the drinking water samples show that the level of nitrate ion exceeds the parameters established in the Concession Contract;\n\nWhereas, in relation to sewage, the same method was used and the results indicate that treatment plants exceed quality standard parameters in connection with nitrogen, total coliforms and other compounds;\n\nWhereas, according to the report of the Regulatory Agency, the sewage treatment plant of Escobar does not meet standards for nearly all parameters and the one in San Miguel is almost out of service given that all parameters exceed the applicable standards;\n\nWhereas, with respect to the quality of service provision, the technical report points out that [AGBA] did not comply with its obligation to maintain drinking water storage tanks in good conditions, which were, for the most part, out of service because of their condition;\n\nWhereas the tanks that are out of service due to poor condition and maintenance are: a) Escobar: Escobar Centro; b) General Rodr\u00edguez: Reinforced concrete Tank out of service; c) Malvinas Argentinas: Primavera; d) Merlo: Merlo Centro and Parque San Mart\u00edn; e) Moreno: Moreno Centro, La Perlita, Trujuy (in service but with large unrepaired cracks); f) San Miguel: San Miguel Centro and General Sarmiento;\n\nWhereas, with respect to service provision, Annex F to the contract establishes that at the end of the first five-year period and/or within five years, drinking water pressure should be 10 meters of water column (10 mWC) and throughout the concession area the measurement of water supply pressure does not meet the established goals, as evidenced by users\u2019 constant and successive complaints;\n\n\u2026\n\nWhereas [AGBA] has failed to comply with drinking water and sewerage service quality levels, according to the parameters set out in Articles 3.6 and 3.12 of the Concession Contract, thus posing a constant threat to the life and health of the population, with no corrective measures being adopted in order to rectify the situation as soon as possible;\n\nWhereas, by means of Resolution No. 52, dated July 24, 2002, [ORAB], taking into account the complaints from the residents of Alem, local authorities and the results of the inspection conducted by the Technical Department of the Agency regarding the fact that the treatment plant located in said neighborhood was abandoned, without proper maintenance, as required from the concessionaire for the provision of the sanitation service called upon [AGBA] to comply with the obligation undertaken under Article 7.4 of the Concession Contract, by ensuring proper operation of the facilities;\n\nWhereas the concessionaire considered that, as it was not part of the service area at the time of takeover, it was not under an obligation to maintain the plant in good working condition, let alone to operate the plant;\n\nWhereas, however, Chapter X of Law No. 11,820 and Chapter 7 of the Concession Contract determine the system applicable to the concession of the public sanitary service, specifying that the assets comprise those transferred to the concessionaire by virtue of the contract, including the assets acquired or built by the concessionaire to fulfill the obligations arising out of the contract; therefore, it is the concessionaire\u2019s duty to manage and maintain the assets allocated to the service in the condition required by the aforesaid chapter of the Law and the contract;\n\n\u2026\n\nWhereas ORAB, by means of Resolution No. 32/03, determined that the Treatment Plant of Bella Vista, San Miguel District, was part of the assets allocated to the public service, as provided by Section 43-II of Law No. 11,820, as it was owned by the former AGOSBA;\n\n\u2026\n\nWhereas, as a result, [AGBA] should have operated the plant in a manner such that it would guarantee maintenance of sewage effluents within the quality standards specified in Annex D to the Concession Contract, as provided by Article 3.13 of the Concession Contract;\n\nWhereas the report prepared by the Technical Department concluded that the Treatment Plant of Bella Vista was in a general state of dereliction, which shows that it was out of service and as a result of its condition, lack of maintenance and operation, effluents do not receive any sort of treatment, thus being discharged raw into the receiving water body;\n\nWhereas [AGBA\u2019s] failure to comply with the provisions set forth in Article 3.13 of the Concession Contract regarding the effluents from the Treatment Plant of Bella Vista, San Miguel District, as well as the provisions contained in Articles 7.4, 3.2, 3.3. 3.4 and related provisions of the aforesaid Contract resulted in the imposition of the fine provided for in Article 13.2.5.2 (e) thereof and an order to cure such default, which has not been cured to this day;\"\n\n264.\n\nThe Province went on to point out that AGBA had failed to comply with its contractual obligation under the Concession Contract to maintain a contract guaranty and an operations bond. On this matter, the Province made the following remarks:\n\n\"Whereas the effect that this breach of contract has on the concession as a matter of public interest is very serious, to the point that if the Province decides to terminate the contract due to the concessionaire\u2019s default, it does not have a guaranty to enforce against such breach, as provided by Article 14.2.2;\n\nWhereas the nature of the breach is objective and it constitutes by itself sufficient ground for termination of the concession due to concessionaire\u2019s fault:\n\nWhereas it may be concluded that all the breaches described herein fall within the grounds for termination due to the concessionaire\u2019s fault provided for in Article 14.1.3, given that the concessionaire was under the obligation to make investments to perform the works undertaken so as to attain the expansion and optimization goals set forth in the POES, and that neither the Emergency Law No. 25,561 enacted by the Argentine Government, nor its provincial counterpart, Law No. 12,858, exempted the concessionaire from complying with its obligations under the Concession Contract;\n\nWhereas, on the contrary, Section 10 of Law No. 25,561, adhered to by the Province of Buenos Aires by means of Section 3 of Law No. 12,858, expressly provides that the elimination of indexation provisions from contracts or the pesification of public service tariffs, or the renegotiation of concession contracts will under no circumstances authorize the public service supplier to suspend or alter the performance of its obligation;\n\nWhereas it should be noted that the breach is at present fully materialized, and in accordance with the provisions contained in Article 14.1.3, last paragraph, cannot be cured, overcome or reversed, as the damage to the population has already been done;\"\n\n265.\n\nThe Province pointed out that AGBA\u2019s breaches of its obligations could not be cured and added:\n\n\"Whereas it is important to highlight the lack of conditioning of the sewage liquid treatment plants, which has a negative impact on the environment and public health, as well as the lack of minimum investments necessary to guarantee the operation of the plants in the localities mentioned above;\n\nWhereas the non-compliance amounts to 84% in relation to installation of water networks and practically 100% in connection with the laying of sewer networks, which has deprived approximately 100,000 potential new users of drinking water and 150,000 potential new users of sewerage in the concession area;\n\nWhereas damage to the public interest derived from such breach is irreparable, given that the main purpose of the Provincial Government in deciding the privatization of the sanitary services was to improve existing service provision and its expansion in order to serve the population that at the time did not have water supply or sewerage system;\n\nWhereas, after six years of the execution of the contract [AGBA] has failed to comply with nearly all the goals undertaken, having made practically no investment whatsoever in service infrastructure, except for water and sewerage works in Escobar and General Rodriguez Districts;\n\nWhereas it should be noted that the concessionaire has repeatedly and systematically violated the User Rules insofar as it has not duly addressed users\u2019 complaints regarding service provision or billing nor has it provided a response within the specified time frames or given an answer to the communication sent by [ORAB] in a timely and proper manner, in order to resolve the complaints received by said Agency;\"\n\n266.\n\nThe Province concluded:\n\n\"Whereas, based on the foregoing, the grounds for termination specified in Article 14.1.3 (h) and (i) of the Concession Contract have also been met, giving rise to termination due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault as a result of the repeated violation of the User Rules and constant withholding or concealment of information from which, in brief, it may be concluded that [AGBA] has materially breached the Contract which entitles the Granting Authority to terminate the Concession Contract due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault, as set forth in Article 14.1.3 (a), (b), (h), (i) and (k) of the Concession Contract;\"\n\n267.\n\nThe operative part of the Resolution reads in its initial part as follows:\n\n\"The Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires resolves:\n\nSECTION 1. To terminate, from the date of notice of this Decree, the Concession Contract entered into with [AGBA] due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault on the grounds for termination provided for in Article 14.1.3 (a), (b), (h), (i), (k) and related provisions of the aforesaid contract.\n\nSECTION 2. [OCABA], upon notice of this Decree, shall adopt any such measures as may be necessary to ensure the receipt and continuance of the public service provision, the assets allocated thereto and the relevant personnel, as set forth in Article 14.4.3 of the Concession Contract.\"\n\n**(iv) Expropriation**\n----------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe first question that arises is whether Impregilo\u2019s investment, as claimed by Impregilo, was expropriated or nationalized. Impregilo refers to a number of measures taken by the Argentine authorities throughout the concession period and leading up to the termination of the concession by Decree No. 1666/06.\n\n269.\n\nExpropriation is not defined in Article 5 of the Argentina-Italy BIT which however mentions expropriation at the same level as nationalization, seizure and other appropriation and sets out the conditions to be fulfilled if such acts are not be consistent with the BIT. These conditions are that the measures *(i)* are taken for a public purpose, of national interest or security, *(ii)* are taken in accordance with due process of law, *(iii)* are non-discriminatory and not contrary to the commitments undertaken, and *(iv)* are accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Expropriation and nationalization are jointly referred to hereinafter as \"expropriation\".\n\n270.\n\nAs in most other BITs, expropriation in the Argentina-Italy BIT may be considered to be an act taken by a State in the exercise of its sovereignty by which an investor is involuntarily deprived of property. Moreover, property should in this connection be given a broad meaning and cover any material and immaterial assets having an economic value, including concessions and contractual rights belonging to the investor. Expropriation is to be distinguished from less far-reaching measures which regulate or restrict the right to use property. Such measures may also have serious economic effects for the investor but do not constitute expropriation. However, there are borderline cases where restrictions on the use of property go so far as to leave the investor with only a nominal property right. This could in appropriate cases be regarded as indirect expropriation. There are other situations in which successive measures are taken to deprive the investor of his rights to administer his property and where at some point the investor may be considered, as a combined effect of several acts, to have been deprived of the property (so-called creeping expropriation).\n\n271.\n\nThe holder of the concession in this case was AGBA, and Impregilo was the main shareholder in AGBA. Impregilo was at no time deprived of its shareholding in AGBA. Nevertheless, Impregilo is protected under the BIT as shareholder which means that if AGBA is exposed to treatment which is not in conformity with the BIT, Impregilo may rely on its rights as shareholder. The Tribunal also refers in this connection to the case of *Azurix* which deals with a similar concession in other parts of the same Province.75\n\n*Azurix Award, supra* n. 71.\n\n272.\n\nDuring the concession period, a number of measures were taken which affected AGBA\u2019s rights. However, none of these measures amounted to a loss of the concession. Nor could the joint effect of these measures be considered to be a loss of property rights. A loss only occurred when the Province terminated the concession by Decree No. 1666/06. However, the termination of the concession is not necessarily equal to expropriation. In fact, the Concession Contract provided for termination in various defined circumstances, and if the Contract is terminated in conformity with these provisions, this is not an act of expropriation by the State but an act performed by the public authorities in their capacity as a party to the Contract.\n\n273.\n\nArticle 14.1.3 of the Concession Contract provided, *inter alia'.*\n\n\"The Granting Authority may terminate the Contract due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault on the following grounds:\n\na) Serious non-compliance with legal, contractual or regulatory provisions applicable to the Service.\n\nb) Repeated and unjustified delays in fulfilling the coverage goals set forth in the POES.\n\n\u2026\n\nh) Repeated violation of the User regulations provided for in Article 13-II of the Regulatory Framework.\n\ni) Repeatedly withholding or concealing information from the Regulatory Agency.\n\n\u2026\n\nk) Failure to furnish, renew or refurnish the Contract guaranty as provided for in Article 11.1, and the Operator guaranty provided for in Article 11.2.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf any non-compliance or violation can be cured, the Regulatory Agency shall demand that the Concessionaire correct its actions, cure the breach in any suitable way and submit the relevant response, in the period fixed according to the circumstances of the situation, the nature of the violation and in view of the public interest, which shall never be shorter than thirty (30) days. Upon expiration of the period accorded to the Concessionaire, the Regulatory Agency shall give notice to the Granting Authority of the subsistence of the non-compliance or breach if it has been duly proved, and the Granting Authority may terminate the Contract due to the Concessionaire\u2019s fault.\"\n\n274.\n\nIn its Decision of July 11, 2006 to terminate the Contract, the Province of Buenos Aires referred to numerous breaches by AGBA of its obligations under the Contract and based the termination on Article 14.1.3 (a), (b), (h), (i) and (k) of the Contract.\n\n275.\n\nImpregilo argues that the decision to terminate the concession was in reality a political decision based on the policy of the regime that public facilities like water and sewage services should not be provided by private companies but by entities owned by the State or the Provinces. From such a perspective, the termination was in fact an expropriation, and the reasons given for it were only a pretext for transferring the services to public bodies.\n\n276.\n\nIn support of this view, Impregilo has referred to President Kirchner\u2019s policy on these matters and to statements made by the Province\u2019s Governor, Mr. Felipe Sol\u00e1, and the Minister of Public Works of the Province, Mr. Eduardo Sicaro.\n\n277.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal accepts that the Argentine administration may have set up as a political goal to transfer water and sewerage services to public entities. However, this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the termination of the Concession Contract with AGBA was an act of expropriation. The Tribunal refers in this connection to the case of *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f4m\u00fc Kft* v. *Hungary* in which the tribunal stated:\n\n\"10.3.23 However, the fact that an issue becomes a political matter,...does not mean that the existence of a rational policy is erased.\"76\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f4m\u00fc Kft v. The Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22 (ECT), para. 10.3.23.\n\n278.\n\nWhat is decisive is whether the reasons given for the termination constituted a legally valid ground for termination according to the provisions of the Concession Contract.\n\n279.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that the reasons given by the Province for its decision to terminate the Concession Contract were very extensive and specific. They include a detailed account of AGBA\u2019s performance in each separate area, *i.e.* the City of Bel\u00e9n de Escobar and the Districts of General Rodr\u00edguez, Jos\u00e9 C. Paz, Malvinas Argentinas, Merlo, Moreno, San Miguel and Escobar, and they indicate, in precise figures, that AGBA, during the first five-year period, failed significantly to carry out its undertakings in regard to investments and the expansion of water and sewage services. The Tribunal finds no reason to doubt that the figures contained in the Decree are mainly accurate, and the conclusion must be that AGBA did not attain the figures of investments and expansion of services set up as undertakings in the POES and the Five-Year Plan.\n\n280.\n\nHowever, failures in AGBA\u2019s performance were, to some extent, connected with failures by the Province. In particular, the Province did not deliver on time the UNIREC plants which it had undertaken to deliver in 2001. This affected AGBA\u2019s ability to expand sewage connections in certain areas, at least during the latter part of the five-year period, but it cannot account for all deficiencies in its performance. There were other treatment plants which should have been established by AGBA itself but which could not be completed due to insufficient funds. Also the fact, mentioned above, of an unexpected incorporation of a large number of additional users with a particularly low collectability rate made it more difficult for AGBA to live up to some of its undertakings.\n\n281.\n\nThe question also arises whether or to what extent AGBA\u2019s obligations were restricted by ORAB\u2019s Resolutions according to which, first, AGBA had met the service expansion and quality goals of the first year of the concession (year 2000) and, secondly, the POES obligations in the second concession year (year 2001) were suspended with the effect that measures which had not been accomplished during that year should not lead to penalties according to Article 13.2.5.5 of the Concession Contract.\n\n282.\n\nIn ORAB\u2019s Resolution No. 77/02, nothing is stated, at least not explicitly, about any effects of the suspension for 2001 on AGBA\u2019s obligations during the third, fourth and fifth years of the concession (2002, 2003 and 2004). Nor is it specified for how long AGBA\u2019s obligations during the second year would be suspended. The Argentine Republic\u2019s position is that, while AGBA\u2019s obligations did not have to be fulfilled in 2001, they would have to be fulfilled later during the first five-year period and thus before the end of 2004. This view is supported by the terms of Decree No. 1666/06 terminating the concession. It could be argued, however, that the suspension would be effective as long as negotiations about a revision of the contractual conditions were going on between the Province and AGBA.\n\n283.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that, in the examination of whether the termination of AGBA\u2019s concession constitutes expropriation, it is not decisive whether or not the Province had a correct understanding of AGBA\u2019s obligations under the Concession Contract. What is relevant is rather that the Province, with some justification, considered that AGBA had grossly failed in fulfilling its contractual obligations and terminated the Concession Contract on this basis. This is sufficient, in the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s opinion, to exclude that the termination could be regarded as an act of - direct or indirect - expropriation or other appropriation of AGBA\u2019s property or Impregilo\u2019s investment. It has also in no way been proven that the termination of the Concession Contract was the last step in a successive series of measures taken by the Province with a view to depriving AGBA of the concession, or, in other words, that AGBA was exposed to \"creeping expropriation\".\n\n**(v) Fair and equitable treatment**\n------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nAccording to Article 2 para. 2 of the BIT, investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment. It is added that neither State shall impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, enjoyment, transformation, cessation or disposal of investments made in its territory by the other State\u2019s investors.\n\n285.\n\nThe term \"fair and equitable treatment\" appears in many BITs. It cannot be easily defined, and it is generally believed to require at least respect for the international minimum standard of protection which, according to international customary law, any State is obliged to afford to foreign property in its territory. The Tribunal considers that the term \"fair and equitable treatment\", as it appears in the present BIT and in other similar BITs, is intended to give adequate protection to the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n286.\n\nAs far as the precise relation between \"fair and equitable treatment\" and the minimum standard of international law is concerned, there are two main approaches adopted by ICSID tribunals.\n\n287.\n\nThe first approach is that \"fair and equitable treatment\" has to be equated with the minimum standard of treatment provided for by general international law. This has been, for example, the position adopted by the *CMS* tribunal:\n\n\"In fact, the Treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment and its connection with the required stability and predictability of the business environment, founded on solemn legal and contractual commitments, is not different from the international law minimum standard and its evolution under customary law.\"77\n\n*CMS,* Award, May 12, 2005, para.284.\n\n288.\n\nThe second approach deals with \u2019\u2019fair and equitable treatment\" as an autonomous standard, considered in general as more demanding and more protective of the investors\u2019 rights than the minimum standard of treatment provided for by general international law. The *Azurix* tribunal, for example, adopted this position:\n\n\"The clause, as drafted, permits to interpret fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security as higher standards than required by international law. The purpose of the third sentence is to set a floor, not a ceiling in order to avoid a possible interpretation of these standards below what is required by international law.\"78\n\n*Azurix, supra* n. 71, para. 361.\n\n289.\n\nHowever, the distinction between the two interpretations is not decisive in the consideration of the present case, for the reasons stated below.\n\n290.\n\nIf fair and equitable treatment is indeed linked to the legitimate expectations of the investors, these have to be evaluated considering all circumstances. In the Tribunal\u2019s understanding, fair and equitable treatment cannot be designed to ensure the immutability of the legal order, the economic world and the social universe and play the role assumed by stabilization clauses specifically granted to foreign investors with whom the State has signed investment agreements. The same approach was followed by the ICSID tribunal in *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania:*\n\n\"It is each State\u2019s undeniable right and privilege to exercise its sovereign legislative power. A State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at its own discretion. Save for the existence of an agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause or otherwise, there is nothing objectionable about the amendment brought to the regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its investment.\"79\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania* [hereinafter *Parkerings-Compagniet]* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8), Award, September 11, 2007, para. 332.\n\n291.\n\nThe legitimate expectations of foreign investors cannot be that the State will never modify the legal framework, especially in times of crisis, but certainly investors must be protected from unreasonable modifications of that legal framework.\n\n292.\n\nIn this context, the Arbitral Tribunal observes that the existence of legitimate expectations and the existence of contractual rights are two separate issues. This has been highlighted by the *Parkerings-Compagniet* tribunal, which made a clear distinction between contractual obligations under national law and legitimate expectations under international law:\n\n\"It is evident that not every hope amounts to an expectation under international law. The expectation a party to an agreement may have of the regular fulfilment of the obligation by the other party is not necessarily an expectation protected by international law. In other words, contracts involve intrinsic expectations from each party that do not amount to expectations as understood in international law.\"80\n\n*Id,* para. 344.\n\n293.\n\nChristoph Schreuer also explains that contractual rights are not to be equated with legitimate expectations:\n\n\"Taken to its logical conclusion this argument would put all agreements between the investor and the host State under the protection of the FET standard. If this position were to be accepted, the FET standard would be nothing less than a broadly interpreted umbrella clause.\"81\n\nC. Schreuer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment: Interactions with other Standards\", Transnational Dispute Management, Vol. 4, Issue 5 at 18 (September 2007).\n\n294.\n\nThus, in so far as the Province\u2019s acts are exclusively contractual, they cannot amount to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard based on a theory of legitimate expectations. In *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,82* the tribunal stated: \"For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal adds that a breach of fair and equitable treatment requires conduct in the exercise of sovereign powers.\"\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, August 27, 2009, para. 377.\n\n295.\n\nSince Impregilo\u2019s right as shareholder in AGBA is protected by the BIT, the Arbitral Tribunal finds it relevant to examine the treatment afforded to AGBA, the company of which it was a shareholder, as such action must be considered to have affected Impregilo\u2019s rights as an investor, rights that were protected under the BIT.\n\n296.\n\nIn the context of BITs, contractual rights and obligations must in principle be distinguished from treaty rights, the relevant criterion being whether the State or its entities act as holder of sovereign power or as parties to a contract.\n\n297.\n\nHowever, there may be cases where a state entity which has concluded a contract with an investor performs acts which do not only constitute a breach of the contract but are at the same time a misuse of its status as part of the State organization to the detriment of the investor and thereby involve the State\u2019s responsibility as party to a BIT.\n\n298.\n\nIn the present case, many of the acts complained of by Impregilo concern the contractual relationship between AGBA and the Province. Such acts are, for instance, those which relate to AGBA\u2019s entitlement to work charges and connection fees and to an increased sewage coefficient as well as other matters relating to specific clauses in the contractual provisions agreed between AGBA and the Province. Other contractual problems have concerned the application of tax stabilization provisions, the suspension of the right to interrupt services to non-paying customers and the installation of meters at customers\u2019 requests. Other measures that should be mentioned in this context are the Province\u2019s failure to deliver the UNIREC plants in time and the fact that a large number of users of water and sewage services with particularly low payment capacity were added to AGBA\u2019s circle of customers which made it more difficult for AGBA to comply with its contractual obligations and reach the envisaged expansion goals.\n\n299.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore finds it appropriate to examine whether the alleged contractual breaches, or any of them, could affect Argentina\u2019s responsibility under the BIT because they were a misuse of public power or reveal a pattern directed at damaging AGBA and, indirectly, Impregilo, as one of its shareholders.\n\n300.\n\nIn this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following observations on the following alleged contractual breaches.\n\n301.\n\nImpregilo has complained of inaccuracies in the data bases handed over to AGBA as concessionaire. The Argentine Republic has responded that the Province analyzed each claim raised by AGBA regarding the update of databases and allowed corrections to be made, where appropriate. The Arbitral Tribunal cannot find that this was a misuse of public power.\n\n302.\n\nIn so far as Impregilo alleges that AGBA was prohibited from receiving connection charges, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that, according to Article 11 of Annex \u00d1, AGBA was allowed to charge and collect a connection fee, once a user had been provided with a connection to the mains. However, there was an area in which AGOSBA had already installed connections which had been improved by AGBA, and the question arose whether AGBA was entitled to bill connection charges for the improved installations. In Resolution 44/00, ORAB stated that the area was already served by AGOSBA *(\"area servida\"),* that this had been made clear to all interested parties during the bidding process, and that AGBA therefore only had the right in this area to bill charges for the use of services. The Arbitral Tribunal cannot find that this was an unreasonable application of the Concession Contract or that it involved in any way the State as a sovereign power.\n\n303.\n\nIn so far as Impregilo complains that work charges were not paid to AGBA, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that, according to Article 10 of Annex \u00d1, a work fee was to be paid by customers at the time the public service was connected for the drinking water supply and sewage services. In Resolution 14/02, ORAB stated that it had repeatedly asked AGBA to provide information about the justification of these charges in some areas and that AGBA had failed to do so. ORAB therefore decided in the Resolution that AGBA must refrain, in these areas, from imposing work charges until ORAB, on the basis of information provided by AGBA, had analyzed the situation further. While the Argentine Republic argues that AGBA had not sufficiently demonstrated that it had carried out building work for which it was entitled to impose work charges, Impregilo alleges that the information requested by ORAB was excessive and unnecessary. This appears as a typical contractual dispute which cannot involve responsibility under the BIT.\n\n304.\n\nAs regards AGBA\u2019s entitlement to an increased sewage coefficient, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that Article 4 of Annex \u00d1 to the Concession Contract provided as a condition for the application of the coefficient that all the expansion goals in the POES for the preceding year had been satisfied. As regards the first year (2000), it seems that AGBA was granted the coefficient increase once the resolution approving AGBA\u2019s performance had been issued. However, AGBA was not granted retroactive payment, since the authorities considered that the delay in the approval of the performance was due to AGBA\u2019s own delay in providing relevant information. The Arbitral Tribunal has no basis for concluding that this assessment was unjustified or that it was in any way a misuse of State power. As regards the second year (2001), the Argentine Republic points out that AGBA did not attain its POES goals but was granted a suspension of their fulfillment. In such circumstances the condition in Article 4 of Annex \u00d1 had not been satisfied.\n\n305.\n\nIn regard to Impregilo\u2019s complaint that ORAB failed to apply the tax stabilization provisions in the Concession Contract, the Argentine Republic replies that AGBA never requested an extraordinary review which it should have done according to the Concession Contract. On the other hand, the Argentine Republic points out that tax changes formed part of the elements that were discussed during the renegotiation process. No element is present which would elevate this matter to a treaty dispute.\n\n306.\n\nAs concerns Impregilo\u2019s complaint of the suspension of AGBA\u2019s right to interrupt services to customers who did not pay for the services, the Argentine Republic argues that ORAB\u2019s decision ordering AGBA to suspend the use of the cut off mechanism for certain users was a temporary measure for the duration of the economic emergency. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that Article 29 of Annex \u00d1 provides that the Concessionaire may not interrupt the service in some special cases, one of them being that the Regulatory Agency directs the Concessionaire to suspend temporarily the interruption, in anticipated and extraordinary circumstances, and pursuant to a grounded decision. Impregilo has not demonstrated that ORAB misused public power by insisting on the application of the said exception in this case.\n\n307.\n\nAs regards Impregilo\u2019s complaint of ORAB\u2019s decision to impose on AGBA an obligation to install meters at the Customer\u2019s request, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that, while this increased the demands on AGBA, it was not inconsistent with any rule in the Concession Contract. It also appears from Article 1.9 of the Contract that AGBA, in regard to the performance of the Contract, was subject to the control and regulation of ORAB as Regulatory Agency. There is no appearance of any misuse of public power in this respect.\n\n308.\n\nAs regards the Province\u2019s failure to deliver the UNIREC plants on time, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts that the absence of these plants may have made it significantly more difficult for AGBA to fulfill some of its contractual obligations. However, the reasons for the Province\u2019s failure seems to have been of a financial character, and even if this could be seen as a serious contractual breach, it does not appear that, standing alone, it would have the character required for attributing responsibility to the State as holder of public power.\n\n309.\n\nAlso in regard to the remaining alleged contractual breaches, the Arbitral Tribunal finds no element that could involve Argentina\u2019s responsibility under the BIT. Nor can the Tribunal find any evidence of a pattern of acts by State entities aimed at causing damage to Impregilo as investor.\n\n310.\n\nThe question whether Impregilo was subjected to unfair or inequitable treatment must therefore be answered on the basis of State acts other than those performed by the Province as a party to the Concession Contract.\n\n311.\n\nAs general background, it should first be noted that AGBA, already in the beginning of the concession period, had difficulties complying with its obligations in the Concession Contract. On May 17, 2001, AGBA therefore wrote to the Province and referred to the high non-collection rates in the concession area. AGBA pointed out that this affected AGBA\u2019s capacity to make the necessary investments and was an unforeseeable and substantial change in the conditions on which AGBA had entered into the concession. AGBA had also experienced difficulties in obtaining loans. AGBA therefore made the following request:\n\n\"During the 16 months it has been providing the service, AGBA has clearly shown its capacity to perform the Concession Contract in an efficient manner as regards all matters within its reasonable control. The abovementioned problems exceed such scope and therefore make it necessary to implement corrective mechanisms to restore the Contract\u2019s equilibrium in order to fulfill its purpose.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and in order to proceed in the shortest time possible, as required by the circumstances, we hereby request that a work commission be created in order to jointly analyze the solutions and alternatives most appropriate for that purpose.\n\nIn addition, we also request, as a provisional measure, that the expansion goals be temporarily suspended until the above commission makes a decision.\n\nFinally, we require that the Granting Authority actively cooperate in the negotiations currently being held with the [Inter-American Development Bank] for funding, in such aspects as may be within the scope of its powers.\"\n\n312.\n\nA second request for relief in its obligations was made by AGBA on July 17, 2001. This time AGBA referred to the serious market conditions and the difficulties to obtain loans and requested a \"temporary neutralization\" of the time schedule in the first Five-Year Plan.\n\n313.\n\nOn both these two requests for exemptions from AGBA\u2019s obligations, the Province, although only after raising objections and after a long period of reflection, reacted favorably.\n\n314.\n\nIn Resolution No. 69/02 of December 5, 2002, ORAB resolved that AGBA had met the service expansion and quality goals of the first year of the concession (year 2000), as provided in Annex F to the Concession Contract and incorporated into the first Five-Year Plan which was an integral part of the POES. On December 30, 2002, in Resolution No. 77/02, ORAB also granted AGBA\u2019s second request for a suspension of the POES obligations. It did so for the second concession year 2001 with the effect that measures which had not been accomplished during that year should not lead to penalties according to Article 13.2.5.5 of the Concession Contract.\n\n315.\n\nHowever, AGBA\u2019s problems were not resolved but were further aggravated by the emergency measures imposed in connection with the economic crisis in Argentina and by the failure to restore an equilibrium by way of a negotiated adaptation of AGBA\u2019s contractual commitments.\n\n316.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that, in the assessment of whether AGBA was given fair and equitable treatment, the crucial events are those which began in 2002, when emergency legislation was enacted. It is clear that AGBA\u2019s activities were to a large extent affected by the emergency measures that were taken to meet the economic crisis and which had remaining effects for AGBA even after the crisis had subsided a few years later.\n\n317.\n\nOn January 6, 2002, the Argentine Congress adopted the Emergency Law declaring the existence of a public emergency with regard to social, economic, administrative, financial and exchange rate matters. Under this law, the State adopted general measures aimed at renegotiating public service contracts. The law was promulgated as Law No. 25,561 on Public Emergency and Exchange Regime Reform. Utilities contracts were \"pesified\" at parity level and tariffs were frozen. On January 11, 2002, ORAB \"pesified\" AGBA\u2019s tariffs at parity rate. On February 28, 2002, the Province of Buenos Aires adopted certain sections of the Emergency Law as Provincial Law No. 12,858.\n\n318.\n\nFor AGBA, this had a dramatic negative impact on the economic prospects of the concession. As before, the fees for water and sewerage service were to be billed in pesos, but while AGBA, before the Emergency Law, had been able to rely on the legal exchange rate of 1 peso = 1 dollar, AGBA could now only change pesos according to the current exchange rate on the market, and the value of the peso on the market in relation to the dollar was considerably lower than before.\n\n319.\n\nThe question arises whether the \"pesification\" was a breach of Argentina\u2019s obligation under Article 2 para. 2 of the BIT to give fair and equitable treatment to Impregilo\u2019s investment.\n\n320.\n\nAs regards the Concession Contract, the relevant provision is to be found in Article 20 of Annex \u00d1 which provides that tariffs are stated in US Dollars but that users shall receive their bills stated in pesos. The Article further states:\n\n\"The applicable conversion shall be performed on the basis of the 1 Dollar = 1 Peso parity established in the Convertibility Law or any other exchange rate from time to time established by law to replace such parity in force at bill cutoff date.\"\n\n321.\n\nIt appears from this provision that the Parties considered the possibility that the parity rate of 1 peso = 1 dollar might change during the concession period but only envisaged the case that the rate would be replaced by a different exchange rate also determined by law. This means, for instance, that, if a new exchange rate of 2 pesos = 1 dollar had been fixed by law, that new rate would automatically have become applicable to the Concession Contract. In other words, AGBA had no guarantee that the exchange rate would remain the same and had accepted to stand the risk if changes were made by law.\n\n322.\n\nArticle 20 of Annex \u00d1 does not specifically deal with the case that a new exchange rate is created by market forces and not by legislation. On the one hand, it is not obvious that the Parties would have intended this situation to be treated differently from a changed exchange rate imposed by legislation. On the other hand, the situation is undoubtedly not covered by the wording of Article 20.\n\n323.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not find it clear how the Concession Contract should be interpreted and applied in regard to this particular situation. Consequently, different views may be held on whether the \"pesification\" was as such a violation of the Province\u2019s obligations under Article 20 of Annex \u00d1 to the Concession Contract.\n\n324.\n\nThere is, however, also another provision in the Concession Contract which should be taken into account, *i.e.* Article 12.1.1, which provides that \"[t]he calculation of applicable tariffs pursuant to Article 28 II of Law 11,820 shall be based on the general principle that tariffs shall cover all operating expenses, maintenance expenses and service amortization and provide a reasonable return on Concessionaire\u2019s investment subject to efficient management and operation by the Concessionaire and strict compliance with the applicable service quality and expansion goals\". This may be regarded as an essential basis for the concession which would have to be upheld even in a changing economic climate.\n\n325.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that, once the value of the peso was determined by market conditions, the balance provided for in Article 12.1.1 no longer existed and that, according to Article 12.1.1, it was then incumbent on the Province, in order to treat AGBA in a fair and equitable manner, to find appropriate solutions to restore the envisaged balance. In other words, since the new exchange rate caused by the abolition of the fixed legal rate had highly detrimental effects on AGBA, the Province should have offered AGBA a reasonable adjustment of its obligations under the Concession Contract.\n\n326.\n\nIndeed, it appears that the Emergency Law also envisaged a renegotiation of public utilities agreements to adapt them to the new exchange system. This would have been a basis for finding a new equilibrium between the Parties to the Concession Agreement and for ensuring that Impregilo, as shareholder in AGBA, was granted fair and equitable treatment.\n\n327.\n\nIn this respect, the available documentation shows that AGBA repeatedly asked for negotiations about a revision of the Concession Contract. Reference is made in this respect to AGBA\u2019s letters to various authorities dated February 19, April 17, June 11, June 28, August 14, October 8 and October 30, 2002 as well as August 27, September 22 and December 2, 2003 and 13 January 2004. Moreover, the Province, on May 13, 2002, by Decree 1175/02, set up a Special Commission for the Evaluation of the Impact of the Crisis on Tariffs and Contracts regarding Public Services.\n\n328.\n\nIt is also important to note that the New Regulatory Framework for the Provision of the Drinking Water and Wastewater Public Services, enacted in Decree No. 878/03, contained certain new elements which were unfavorable to AGBA. It provided for State intervention in corporate decisions (Section 47) and shifted the balance in favor of the users by introducing, for instance, a social tariff for low-income residential owners (Section 55). Although Decree No. 878/03 also provided for renegotiation of concession contracts, it was clear that the existence of the Decree would significantly affect the character of the renegotiations by making it in practice necessary for AGBA to accept the rules and principles already laid down in the Decree. The New Regulatory Framework therefore changed the balance between the Province and the concessionaire in a manner which was clearly disadvantageous to the concessionaire.\n\n329.\n\nMoreover, it appears that the Province was reluctant to renegotiate the Concession Contract. The position of the Province is reflected in a letter of July 23, 2002 to ORAB in which the Undersecretary of Public Services of the Province indicated that adjustments in favor of AGBA should not be made, as this would have negative effects for the customers whose economic interests required protection.\n\n330.\n\nSince the disturbance of the equilibrium between rights and obligations in the concession was essentially due to measures taken by the Argentine legislator, it must have been incumbent on Argentina to act to effectively restore an equilibrium on a new or modified basis. Although Argentina has attributed the failure of the negotiations to what it regarded as AGBA\u2019s unreasonable demands, it does not appear that Argentina took any measures to create for AGBA a reasonable basis for pursuing its tasks as concessionaire which had been negatively affected by the emergency legislation, including the New Regulatory Framework.\n\n331.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Argentina, by failing to restore a reasonable equilibrium in the concession, aggravated its situation to such extent as to constitute a breach of its duty under the BIT to afford a fair and equitable treatment to Impregilo\u2019s investment.\n\n**(vi) Further allegations**\n----------------------------\n\n332.\n\nImpregilo has also alleged that Argentina:\n\n(a) impaired by unjustified and discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of Impregilo\u2019s investment,\n\n(b) failed to provide full protection and security to these investments, and\n\n(c) violated specific obligations entered into with respect to Impregilo\u2019s investments in AGBA.\n\n333.\n\nAs regards the allegation under (a), the Arbitral Tribunal notes Article 2 para. 2 of the BIT which provides in a first sentence that \"[i]nvestments made by investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment\" and in a second sentence that \"[n]either Party shall impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, enjoyment, transformation, cessation or disposal of investments made in its territory by the other Contracting Party\u2019s investors\". The Tribunal regards the second sentence as a specification of the general requirement of fair and equitable treatment dealt with in the first sentence. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that, once a breach of the obligations in the first sentence has been found, a further examination based on the second sentence is not required.\n\n334.\n\nAs regards the allegation under (b), which relates to the requirement of \"full protection and security\" in the Argentina-US BIT, which is claimed to be applicable in this case through the MFN clause in the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that where, as in the present case, there has been a failure to give an investment fair and equitable treatment, it is not necessary to examine whether there has also been a failure to ensure full protection and security.\n\n335.\n\nAs regards the allegation under (c), the Arbitral Tribunal, with reference to its views on the distinction between contractual claims and treaty claims, finds that the obligations referred to are contractual obligations between AGBA and the Province which fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (see paras. 183-185 above).\n\n**(vii) State of necessity**\n----------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe emergency legislation in the Argentine Republic was enacted in reaction to a very serious economic crisis in the country. The Arbitral Tribunal has no doubt that drastic measures were required in order to safeguard economic and political stability.\n\n337.\n\nAs regards the Argentine-Italy BIT, the Parties have discussed the possible impact of Article 4 of the BIT and the rules on state of necessity in international law.\n\n338.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT provides that investors of one Contracting Party whose investments suffer tosses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency or other similar political-economic events shall be accorded by such other Party in whose territory the investment was made treatment no less favorable that that accorded to its own nationals or legal entities or to investors of any third country as regards damages.\n\n339.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is satisfied that the economic crisis in Argentina in 2002 could be regarded as a political-economic occurrence similar to a national emergency and that Article 4 of the BIT is therefore applicable to the situation. It notes, however, that Article 4 provides for no exception from the obligations of the State in whose territory an investment was made but merely gives the investor a right to national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment in respect of damages.\n\n340.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal thus notes that the Contracting Parties, when concluding the BIT, had national emergencies and similar occurrences in mind but considered that no special regulations were necessary apart from a rule that an investor protected under the BIT would not be treated less favorably than other national or international investors. Consequently, the Parties did not find it necessary to provide in the BIT for any exception from each Contracting Party\u2019s obligations under the BIT.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal thus cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s interpretation, which goes against the plain meaning of the text, and agrees with Impregilo that Article 4 applies to measures adopted in response to a loss, not to measures that cause a loss. The plain meaning of the provision is that the standards of treatment of the BIT - national and most-favored-nation treatment - have to be applied when a State tries to mitigate the consequences of a situation of war or other emergency. This is in line with the analysis of the same provision made by the tribunal in *CMS* when it stated that:\n\n\"The plain meaning of the Article is to provide a floor treatment for the investor in the context of the measures adopted in respect of the losses suffered in the emergency, not different from that applied to nationals or other foreigners. The Article... -ensures that any measures directed at offsetting or minimizing losses will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.\"83\n\n*CMS, supra* n. 77, para. 375.\n\n342.\n\nThe same analysis is made in the *Suez* cases:\n\n\"270.... The clear meaning of those provisions is to impose on Contracting Parties an obligation of equality of treatment of investments for losses resulting from war, civil disturbance, and national emergencies. The provision contains no reference whatsoever to other obligations imposed by the BITs on Contracting Parties, let alone to provide for an exemption from such obligations.\"84\n\n*Suez II, supra n. 74,* Decision on Liability, ICSID Case No ARB/03/19, para. 203.\n\n343.\n\nIt is therefore the conclusion of the Tribunal that any violations committed by Argentina cannot be excused by Article 4. However, Article 4 cannot be read so as to exclude the application of customary international law to an emergency situation.\n\n344.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore must evaluate Argentina's necessity plea under the standard set by customary international law, which the Parties agree has been codified in Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. That standard by definition is stringent and difficult to satisfy. According to the ILC, necessity arises where there is an irreconcilable conflict between an essential interest on the one hand and an [international] obligation of the State invoking necessity on the other. These special features mean that necessity will only rarely be available to excuse non-performance of an obligation and that it is subject to strict limitations to safeguard against possible abuse.85\n\n*See* The International Law Commission, Articles On State Responsibility, reprinted in The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles On State Responsibility: Introduction, Text And Commentaries, at 61 (James Crawford ed., Cambridge Univ. Press 2002) (2001); see also U.N. GAOR, Int\u2019l L. Comm\u2019n., Fourth Report on State Responsibility, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/517 (Apr. 2, 2001). The ILC Articles (and other State responsibility documents) are available online at www.stateresponsibibty.com ILC Commentary to Article 25, at para. 2; *see also* ILC Commentary to Article 25, at 14.\n\n345.\n\nAs the Party pleading the defense, Argentina must meet the significant burden of proving that it should be allowed to justify its failure to perform its valid international obligations under the BIT on grounds of necessity.86\n\nILC Commentary to Chapter V (\"Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness\"), at para. 8 (\"Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V...[including necessity]... the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.\").\n\n346.\n\nAt the outset, the Arbitral Tribunal must define several terms in para. 1(a) of Draft Article 25. Regarding the meaning of the term \"essential interest,\" the ILC has observed that \"the extent to which a given interest is \u2018essential\u2019 depends on all the circumstances, and cannot be prejudged\" and that \"[i]t extends to particular interests of the State and its people, as well as of the international community as a whole\". In the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, the term \"essential interest\" can encompass not only the existence and independence of a State itself, but also other subsidiary but nonetheless \"essential\" interests, such as the preservation of the State\u2019s broader social, economic and environmental stability,87 and its ability to provide for the fundamental needs of its population. It follows that, in addition to Argentina's overall stability, the need to provide the population with water and sewage facilities represented an \"essential interest\" which, in regard to thousands of people, was to be served by AGBA\u2019s concession and which would allegedly be \"imperiled\" for them but for the acts of the Argentine authorities.\n\n*See* ILC Commentary to Article 25, at paras 5-9 (discussing cases where the \"essential interest\" at stake ranged from economic stability to the natural environment).\n\n347.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal must consider whether the economic situation in Argentina leading up to its implementation of the emergency legislation (Federal Law No. 25,561 of 6 January 2002 and Provincial Law No. 12,858 of 28 February 2002) constituted a \"grave and imminent peril\" to the State\u2019s essential interest. In this respect, the ILC Commentary explains that \"the peril has to be objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible\", and that \"[i]n addition to being grave, the peril has to be imminent in the sense of proximate\".88 According to the Commentary, the International Court of Justice explained in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* case that \"the invoking State could not be the sole judge of the necessity, but a measure of uncertainty about the future does not necessarily disqualify a State from invoking necessity, if the peril is clearly established on the basis of the evidence reasonably available at the time\".89\n\nILC Commentary to Article 25, at para. 15. Nevertheless, the Commentary notes the ICJ\u2019s decision in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* case, which points out that a far-off \"peril\" could be held to be \"imminent\" as soon as such peril is recognized, and just because that peril is \"far off,\" it is no less \"certain\" or \"inevitable.\"\n\n*Id.,* at para. 16.\n\n348.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes the following facts which are of public knowledge. At the end of 2001, savings were massively withdrawn from the banks. In order to control the situation, the Government issued Decree No. 1570/01, known as \"Corralito\", on December 1, 2001, restricting bank withdrawals and prohibiting any transfer of currency abroad. The situation led to demonstrations and tens of deaths in December 2001, and these, in turn, brought about the resignation of President de la R\u00faa, on December 20, 2001. It can be noted that, within a term of less than 10 days, Argentina had a succession of five presidents, who resigned one after the other. The situation was indeed critical, and at the end of that month, Argentina partly defaulted on her international obligations and abandoned the convertibility regime.\n\n349.\n\nArgentina\u2019s crisis of 2001-2002 resulted in a massive default on the public debt, on the domestic as well as the international level. So alarming was the situation that the United Nations General Assembly resolved to suspend the payment of Argentina\u2019s membership dues on account of the crisis, which was the first case in history where this was done.\n\n350.\n\nOn the basis of the extensive reports on the economic situation in Argentina before the emergency legislation was introduced,90 the Arbitral Tribunal accepts that there was a grave and imminent peril to the \"essential interest\" of Argentina\u2019s economic and social stability within the meaning of para. 1 (a).\n\n*See, e.g.,* Expert Report of Dr. Liliana de Riz (Aug. 13, 2007) (discussing the dire socioeconomic conditions caused by the crisis in Argentina generally and in the area covered by AGBA in particular).\n\n351.\n\nThe further question arises as to whether Argentina\u2019s measures were \"the only way\" for it \"to safeguard its essential interests against a grave and imminent peril\".\n\n352.\n\nAccording to the ILC Commentary, the plea of necessity \"is excluded if there are other (otherwise lawful) means available, even if they may be more costly or less convenient\"91.\n\nILC Commentary to Article 25, at para. 15 (citations omitted).\n\n353.\n\nThe question whether Argentina\u2019s overall management of its public finances and resulting social unrest could have been conducted more successfully, and if so in what way, has been the subject of numerous studies by renowned experts, but the answer remains inconclusive. However, as explained below, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that another criterion for the application of the state of defense exception, *i.e.* the requirement that the State concerned has not contributed to the crisis, has not been satisfied in the present case. The difficult question of whether Argentina\u2019s measures were the only way to safeguard its essential interests will therefore not have to be answered, since whatever the answer would be, the application of the necessity defense will be excluded for another reason in this case.\n\n354.\n\nRegarding the criterion under para. 1 (b), the Arbitral Tribunal finds that no essential interest of any other State or the international community as a whole could have been seriously impaired by the measures taken by Argentina. The ILC Commentary notes that \"the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests, whether these are individual or collective\".92 Given this clarification and the nature of Impregilo\u2019s \"essential interests\", the Arbitral Tribunal cannot agree with Impregilo that its own interests as an Italian legal entity must be taken into account in the balancing required under paragraph 1(b). The interests of a small number of a Contracting State\u2019s nationals or legal entities are not consistent with or qualify as an \"essential interest\" of that State. It follows that any impairment of those interests is irrelevant for purposes of the paragraph. Accordingly, the condition codified under para. 1 (b) has been satisfied.\n\nILC Commentary to Article 25, at para. 17. The Commentary also notes that \"[a]s a matter of terminology, it is sufficient to use the phrase \u2018international community as a whole\u2019 rather than \u2018international community of States as a whole\u2019... *.\" Id.*, at para. 18.\n\n355.\n\nWith respect to para. 2 (a), the Arbitral Tribunal holds that the \"international obligation\" in question refers to Argentina\u2019s obligations to Italian investors as contained in the BIT. The Arbitral Tribunal already has found that the *lex specialis* of Article 4 does not preclude Argentina from invoking the necessity plea, nor do any of its other obligations contained within the BIT. Thus, this criterion is also satisfied.\n\n356.\n\nFinally, it remains for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide, in accordance with para. 2 (b), whether Argentina is precluded from invoking the necessity plea because it has \"contributed to the situation of necessity\". Certain questions arise regarding how \"contributed\" should be defined, including whether the conduct be deliberate *(i.e.* intended to bring about the state of necessity) or reckless or negligent, or even caused by a lesser degree of fault.93 In the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal, a State\u2019s contribution to its necessity situation need not be specifically intended or planned - it can be the consequence, *inter alia,* of well-intended but ill-conceived policies. This result comports with common sense, because a contrary interpretation always would have to ascribe underhanded motives to the government or, more frequently, to the several governments that control the State successively prior to a situation of necessity.94\n\nIn apparent response to this question, the ILC Commentary relies on the ICJ\u2019s decision in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* case, where the ICJ considered that \"because Hungary had \u2018helped, *by act or omission* to bring about\u2019 the situation of alleged necessity, it could not then rely on that situation as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness.\" ILC Commentary to Article 25, at para. 20.\n\nThis conclusion does not purport to characterize the intent behind the measures sought to be justified through the necessity defense, because those measures by definition are meant as a *response* to a crisis, not as a *contribution* to its generation.\n\n357.\n\nMoreover,, the Arbitral Tribunal must consider what level of contribution by the State seeking to invoke the necessity plea should be considered as sufficient to defeat the necessity plea. According to the ILC Commentary, \"contribution to the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral\".95 The Commentary notes further that the threshold for finding that a State contributed to the \"situation of necessity\" under para. 2 (b) is lower than that for an equivalent finding for purposes of *force majeure* (Draft Article 23, para. 2 (a)) and distress (Draft Article 24, para. 2 (a)), because \"necessity needs to be more narrowly confined\".96\n\nILC Commentary to Article 25, at para. 20.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 20.\n\n358.\n\nApplying these principles, the Arbitral Tribunal recognizes that international market forces and events taking place in, *inter alia,* Mexico, Southeast Asia, and Russia affected adversely the economy of Argentina, culminating in the crisis of the early 2000s. Yet, the Arbitral Tribunal has been persuaded by substantial evidence proffered by Impregilo that Argentina\u2019s own economic policies over several years prior to the crisis rendered the economy of the country vulnerable to exogenous shocks and pressures, and impacted adversely the sustainability of its economic model on the national and local levels.97 The Arbitral Tribunal notes, by way of example, Argentina\u2019s long-term failure to exercise fiscal discipline, including control of provincial spending and of the subsidization of the Provinces by the central Government; and its inability to adopt labor and trade policies consistent with the country\u2019s currency board. The resulting high public indebtedness and inflexibility in Argentina\u2019s markets hampered substantially the country\u2019s ability to cope with external shocks, leading to the 2001 crisis. It follows that Argentina contributed significantly to the \"situation of necessity\" within the meaning of para. 2 (b) and therefore failed to meet the criterion under that paragraph.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes, in this regard, the Expert Opinion of Prof. Dr. Sebasti\u00e1n Edwards (Oct. 29, 2009) paras. 78-125 and its associated evidence (discussing the manner in which Argentina\u2019s policies throughout the 1990s contributed to its 2001 crisis).\n\n359.\n\nThe majority of the Arbitral Tribunal therefore concludes that Argentina has not satisfied all of the conditions under Article 25 and, accordingly, may not invoke the necessity plea as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of the acts already identified as violations of its obligations under the BIT.\n\n360.\n\nArbitrator Stern considers as a matter of principle that the State\u2019s contribution to a situation of economic crisis should not be lightly assumed and, on the concrete level, is not convinced that a substantial contribution of the Argentine authorities to the crisis has been satisfactorily proven by strong and convincing evidence. However, as the violation of the fair and equitable treatment, as found by the Tribunal, continued after the crisis, she concurs with the decision on the merits.\n\n**(viii) Compensation**\n-----------------------\n\n361.\n\nAs regards compensation, the basic principle to be applied is that derived from the judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case.98 According to this principle, reparation should as far as possible eliminate the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. In other words, Impregilo should in principle be placed in the same position as it would have been, had Argentina\u2019s unfair and inequitable treatment of Impregilo\u2019s investment not occurred.\n\n*The Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, PCIJ, Series *A,* p. 1382.\n\n362.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal first notes that the price of USD 1.26 million paid by AGBA for the concession was, in relation to the number of inhabitants, very low as compared with the price per inhabitant paid by Azurix for its concession for other parts of the Province of Buenos Aires. The reason was apparently that AGBA\u2019s concession concerned a poor area in which AGBA, in order to reach the goals of the POES with regard to coverage of water and sewerage connections, would have to make very substantial investments. These investments would amount to USD 16.74 million in the first year (2000), USD 87.77 million in the second year (2001), USD 173.79 million in the third year (2002), 211.82 million in the fourth year (2003) and USD 230.92 million in the fifth year (2004).\n\n363.\n\nThe investments were necessary in order to extend the system of water and sewerage connections in the area. The number of such connections was exceptionally low and covered only 35.4% (water) and 13.5% (sewerage) of the population. According to the POES, AGBA was to increase these figures, as regards water, to 63.19% in the third year, 67.93% in the fourth year and 70.68% in the fifth year, and, as regards sewerage, to 41.63% in the third year, 51.34% in the fourth year and 55.80% in the fifth year.\n\n364.\n\nIt appears from the background documents of the concession (the Schroder reports) that the rate of collectability of tariff payments was low in the area - initially about 63% - but according to AGBA\u2019s Business Plan the rate would be gradually increased to 80% in the third year, 83% in the fourth year and 85% in the fifth year.\n\n365.\n\nAs the Arbitral Tribunal understands it, the concession was connected with considerable risks, and its success would depend on whether sufficient funds could be found and whether the payment capacity of the population could be increased quickly. It would also depend on good co-operation with the Province authorities and on the fulfillment of the Province\u2019s obligations under the Concession Contract and the POES. It may be assumed, however, that for Impregilo, as a construction company, another attractive aspect would be that the concession could pave the way to construction contracts in Argentina.\n\n366.\n\nIt soon appeared that the poor collectability rate was a more serious problem than AGBA had expected. This also made it difficult for AGBA to obtain the financing needed for its investments. Negotiations about a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank were not fruitful, and the Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires refused a bridge loan. To some extent, the difficulties in obtaining financing were probably due to the general economic situation, but delays in the construction program of treatment plants, some of which (the UNIREC plants) were to be constructed by the Province and others by AGBA, may also have been a relevant factor affecting the position of the loan institutions.\n\n367.\n\nIn its letter of May 17, 2001, AGBA explained to the Province that the noncollection rates were high and affected the possibilities for AGBA to find financing. As a result, it had also become impossible to achieve the goals of the Five-Year Plan. AGBA requested that a work commission be created to assess the situation and that, in the meantime, the expansion goals be temporarily suspended. The Province replied, on May 30, 2001, by pointing out that the issue of non-collection rates was AGBA\u2019s business risk but nevertheless agreed to set up a working commission. On July 17 and August 15, 2001, AGBA again asked for a temporary suspension of the execution of the POES and this time, as reasons, referred to the economic situation.\n\n368.\n\nThe position subsequently adopted by the authorities appears to the Arbitral Tribunal to be somewhat ambiguous. While, on August 27, 2001, ORAB\u2019s Technical Department found that AGBA\u2019s performance during the first year of the concession had shown an acceptable degree of compliance with the POES, the same Department, in an internal letter of October 10, 2001, stated that neither the goals set forth in the Concession Contract nor those specified in the POES had been attained. Nevertheless, in Resolution No. 69/02 of December 5, 2002, ORAB resolved that AGBA had met the service expansion and quality goals of the first year of the concession (2000), as provided in Annex F to the Concession Contract and incorporated into the first Five-Year Plan which was an integral part of the POES.\n\n369.\n\nIn any case, it is clear to the Arbitral Tribunal that the situation changed in early 2002 with the enactment of emergency legislation which had dramatic effects on AGBA\u2019s contractual rights and obligations. As from that time, there were no possibilities for AGBA to obtain credits and to reach the goals in the POES. In fact, in Resolution No. 77/02 of December 30, 2002, ORAB agreed to suspend the obligations under the POES for the second concession year (2002). No similar decision was taken for the following years 2003, 2004 and 2005, and AGBA may have regarded its undertakings for these years also to have been suspended. The Argentine Republic has stated, however, that the intention was that all obligations for the first five-year period should be complied with before the end of that period. Impregilo seems to consider that AGBA\u2019s obligations continued to be suspended as long as possible adjustments of the Concession Contract had not been agreed between the parties.\n\n370.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Argentine Republic exposed AGBA to treatment which was not fair and equitable, thus violating Article 2 para. 2 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. In particular, the Argentine Republic had failed to take appropriate measures to restore the equilibrium which had been disturbed by the pesification and other measures provoked by the financial crisis. Consequently, in so far as this failure caused damage to Impregilo, Argentina should be under an obligation to compensate Impregilo for the loss it sustained as a result of unfair and inequitable treatment.\n\n371.\n\nIn principle, it is incumbent on Impregilo to prove that it suffered the damage for which it asks to be compensated. However, it cannot be established with certainty in what situation AGBA - and thus Impregilo - would have been, had the Argentine Republic\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard not occurred. Consequently, it would be unreasonable to require precise proof of the extent of the damage sustained by Impregilo. Instead, reasonable probabilities and estimates have to suffice as a basis for claims for compensation.\n\n372.\n\nIn support of its claims for damages, Impregilo relies, in particular, on expert reports by Richard E. Walck and Leonardo Giacchino, whereas the Argentine Republic invokes other expert reports, including those of Jos\u00e9 Pablo Dapena and Germ\u00e1n Coloma. In the latter reports, MM. Dapena and Coloma argue that the concession had no economic value and that no compensation can therefore be justified. MM. Walck and Giacchino disagree and consider that the concession would have produced substantial gains for AGBA. They assess AGBA\u2019s loss by applying a combination of two methods, *i.e.,* on the one hand, a cost or asset based method and, on the other hand, an income method. They consider both methods to be relevant to the assessment of damages in this case but attach more weight (two thirds) to the income method than to the asset based method (one third). They add compound interest to their calculation and arrive at the result that the total value of Impregilo\u2019s investment was, as of July 2006, USD 87,156,098 and, as of October 2008 (including interest at the rate of 15%), USD 119,362,503.\n\n373.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that, according to AGBA\u2019s Business Plan, the concession would be highly profitable. However, there are elements which, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, make it doubtful whether the forecasts in the Business Plan were realistic. First, it is clear that the concession covered a risk area with a poor population whose ability - and willingness - to pay for services was very limited. This is demonstrated not only by statistical figures but also by the fact that the fee that AGBA paid to obtain the concession was very low, almost symbolic, and that the emphasis in the concession was on the large investments that AGBA was required to make in order to fulfill its obligations under the Concession Contract, including the POES and the first Five-Year Plan.\n\n374.\n\nHowever, in reality only a minor part of the envisaged investments were made by AGBA. It appears clearly from the facts of the case that AGBA was unable, already at an early stage of the concession period and a considerable time before the financial crisis reached its peak, to obtain credits necessary for the investments. Moreover, it appears that AGBA was unpleasantly surprised by the low collectability rate in the concession area which must have significantly hampered the expectations of profits from the concession. Even taking into account that the collectability rate was to some degree affected by the fact that there were, as an heritage from AGOSBA, a large number of unregistered users of the water and sewage network, it was AGBA that, in principle, bore the risk of unsatisfactory results as to investments and collectability.\n\n375.\n\nWhen assessing the situation as a whole, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot find it established with a sufficient degree of probability that the concession, even in the absence of acts violating the standard of fair and equitable treatment, would have been profitable for AGBA.\n\n376.\n\nIt is clear, however, that the Province contributed to some extent to the negative development of the concession by not taking appropriate action to restore the equilibrium that had been eliminated by the pesification and by imposing on AGBA a New Regulatory Framework which had a negative effect on AGBA\u2019s contractual rights. These measures which were connected with the economic crisis were the elements that definitely made it impossible for AGBA to implement the concession on an economically sound basis.\n\n377.\n\nThe failure of the concession can therefore be ascribed partly to events for which AGBA stood the risk and partly to acts or failures by the Province.\n\n378.\n\nThe fact that AGBA and the Province have a shared responsibility for the failure of the concession makes it inappropriate to calculate damages on the basis of customary economic parameters such as a cost or asset based method or an income method. Instead, the damages to be paid by the Argentine Republic to compensate for unfair and inequitable treatment should be determined on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the loss that may have been caused to Impregilo.\n\n379.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that capital contributions were made by the shareholders of AGBA, mainly during 2000 and 2001. These contributions constituted a capital injection that was to be used for the benefit of the concession. It is true that Impregilo assumed a risk when providing capital to AGBA. On the other hand, if AGBA\u2019s concession had been successful, this capital would have produced benefits for Impregilo as shareholder. The Tribunal does not find it possible to evaluate potential losses or gains in precise figures but considers that Argentina should in principle be obliged to restitute the investment to Impregilo as compensation for its failure to ensure fair and equitable treatment to the concession.\n\n380.\n\nAs regards the question whether Impregilo, in addition to compensation for the investment, should also be entitled to compensation for its share of AGBA\u2019s potential gains from the concession, the answer must depend on whether there is sufficient reason to believe that such gains would have been obtained, had Argentina treated AGBA in a fair and equitable manner. This would have depended on various circumstances but primarily on whether AGBA would have been able to find sufficient financing and to solve the collectability problems characterizing this particular concession area. Having regard to the character of the concession area and the difficulties experienced by AGBA at the beginning of the concession period, before any emergency laws affected the situation, the Arbitral Tribunal has considerable doubt in this respect. Impregilo has not shown that the concession was likely to have been profitable, if there had been no interference by the Argentine legislator and the Argentine public authorities.\n\n381.\n\nIt follows that the compensation to be awarded to Impregilo should be based only on the capital contribution made by Impregilo. As regards the amount of this contribution, the Arbitral Tribunal finds no reason to doubt the figures presented in MM. Walck\u2019s and Giacchino\u2019s reports. The Tribunal also considers that these figures are not affected by internal changes of shareholdings within the consortium of AGBA shareholders, *i.e.* the transfers of shares from Sideco to Impregilo which took place in March 2000 and April 2002. According to the figures in MM. Walck\u2019s and Giacchino\u2019s reports, the capital contributions of the shareholders to AGBA, mainly in 2000 and 2001, amounted to USD 45,000,000 and Impregilo\u2019s share was USD 21,294,000. Consequently, the amount to be compensated is USD 21,294,000.\n\n**(ix) Interest**\n-----------------\n\n382.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the interest on any damages should be simple or compound interest. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that there is no uniform case-law on this matter but considers that compound interest is in the present case to be preferred in order to eliminate the consequences of the conduct which the Tribunal has found to give rise to an obligation to pay damages.99\n\n*Cf. Azurix supra* n. 71, para. 440. Also, *Metalclad Corp. v. Mexico,* Award, (NAFTA Ch. 11 Arb. Trib., Aug. 30, 2000, para. 128.\n\n383.\n\nOn the other hand, the rate of interest of 15% requested by Impregilo appears to the Arbitral Tribunal to be excessive to restore Impregilo to the position in which it would have been if the breach of the BIT had not taken place. The Tribunal considers a rate of 6% to be adequate and reasonable in the circumstances of this case.\n\n384.\n\nSince the violation found in the present case is not one of expropriation but consisted in a breach of Argentina\u2019s obligation to afford Impregilo\u2019s investment a fair and equitable treatment, it is not evident from which date interest should be calculated. There is no precise point in time when the unfair treatment took place, but there were a series of successive events - actions as well as omissions - which cumulatively were unfair to AGBA and thus also to Impregilo. However, there can be no doubt that, by July 11, 2006, when the Province terminated the concession, its breaches of the BIT had culminated. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore finds it appropriate to choose that date as starting-point for Argentina\u2019s duty to pay interest.100\n\n*Cf. Id.* *Azurix.* Also, *Siemens AG v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/02/8, Award, February 6, 2007, paras. 349-350.\n\n**(x) Costs and expenses**\n--------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that the present case has given rise to a number of important and complex legal issues and that both Parties have raised weighty arguments in support of their respective positions. The Argentine Republic\u2019s jurisdictional objections have been almost entirely rejected, and both Parties have been only partly successful in regard to the merits of the case. In view of the issues in the case as a whole, the Arbitral Tribunal finds it reasonable to order that each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and shall pay half of the costs for ICSID\u2019s and the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s work.\n\n**VI.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nPursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, on October 19, 2011, Argentina filed an application requesting the annulment and stay of enforcement of the Award. The Award was issued on June 21, 2011 by an Arbitral Tribunal consisting of Judge Hans Danelius (President), Judge Charles N. Brower, and Professor Brigitte Stern, in the arbitration between Impregilo and Argentina.\n\n2.\n\nIn order to arrive at this decision the Committee reviewed and evaluated all the arguments of the parties and the documents submitted by them in this proceeding. The fact that the Committee does not specifically mention a given argument or reasoning does not mean that it has not considered the same. In their submissions the parties produced and cited numerous awards and decisions dealing with matters that they consider relevant to this decision on annulment. The Committee has considered these documents carefully and may take into account the reasoning and findings of other committees on annulment. However, in coming to a decision on the matter of annulment raised by Argentina the Committee must perform, and in fact has performed, an independent analysis of the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Rules, and the particular facts of this case.\n\n3.\n\nIn order to summarize some of the factual circumstances mentioned in the Memorial on Annulment, the Committee quotes the following background history that was included in the Award:\n\n\"In the 1990s, water and sewage services in the Province of Buenos Aires were provided by the public utility [company].... In 1996, the Province decided to privatize these services and adopted for this purpose Law No. 11,820... and set up as regulator the Organismo Regulador de Aguas Bonaerense... It also organized a bidding process for the concessions to be issued for the various parts of the Province.\n\nImpregilo formed a consortium with other international companies (Sideco Americana S.A. and Aguas de Bilbao Bizkaia), and, by Provincial Decree No. 2907/99 of October 18, 1999, was awarded one of the concession areas into which the Province\u2019s territory had been divided. Pursuant to the bidding rules, Impregilo and its partners incorporated and funded AGBA, an Argentine company. On December 7, 1999, the Province and AGBA executed the Concession Contract to provide water and sewage services...\"1\n\nImpregilo S.p.A, v. Argentina. ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award of June 21, 2011, \u00b6 \u00b6 13 and 14\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn October 25, 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(2)(b), granted the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) and notified the Parties accordingly.\n\n5.\n\nOn January 30, 2012, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties of the constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee comprising Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno (President), a Costa Rican national, Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a Colombian national, and Ms. Teresa Cheng, a Chinese national, (the *\"ad hoc* Committee\" or \"Committee\"). On the same date the ICSID Secretariat transmitted copies of the Committee members\u2019 signed declarations in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 6(2).\n\n6.\n\nOn March 28, 2012, the first session of the *ad hoc* Committee was held by telephone conference. During such session, various procedural matters were agreed between the Parties and the *ad hoc* Committee. The Parties agreed, *inter alia,* that the present proceedings would be governed by the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules, and that they had no objection to the constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee as described above. They also agreed on a provisional timetable.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 26, 2012, Argentina filed its Memorial on Annulment, followed by a translation into English on July 6, 2012.\n\n8.\n\nOn October 4, 2012, Impregilo filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, followed by a translation into Spanish on October 15, 2012.\n\n9.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, Argentina filed its Reply on Annulment, followed by a translation into English on December 10, 2012.\n\n10.\n\nOn January 23, 2013, Impregilo filed its Rejoinder on Annulment, followed by a translation into Spanish on February 1,2013.\n\n11.\n\nBy email of March 8, 2013, the ICSID Secretariat invited the Parties to inform the *ad hoc* Committee of any proposal they would like to make with regard to the agenda for the hearing and related questions of procedure. On March 13, 2012, Impregilo submitted an agreed draft agenda for the hearing on annulment, which was confirmed by Argentina on March 14, 2013.\n\n12.\n\nOn March 19 and 20, 2013, a hearing was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The proceeding was closed on December 18, 2013, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 38(1).\n\n13.\n\nIn the following paragraphs the Committee will summarize the position of the parties in relation to each annulment argument, and then examine each of the grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and alleged by Argentina.\n\n**III. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. ARGENTINA\u2019S ARGUMENTS**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThis section contains a summary of the arguments submitted by Argentina. All arguments were carefully analyzed and considered by the Committee and the fact that one or more specific allegations are not summarized does not mean that they have not been considered.\n\n15.\n\nArgentina\u2019s first argument is that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers established in the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Argentina based this argument on the fact that, in its opinion, the Tribunal improperly extended the MFN clause to matters of jurisdiction. In this regard Argentina said: \"In the case of the Argentina-Italy BIT, arbitral tribunals can only exercise their jurisdiction if the dispute has been previously submitted \u2019to a competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located' and continues to exist after a period of 18 months has elapsed \u2019since notification of the commencement of the proceeding before the national jurisdictions\u2019...\"2 Argentina emphasized that this requirement was recognized by the Tribunal as a general condition that has no exception.3\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 21\n\nId., \u00b6 22\n\n16.\n\nFor ease of reference and given that it was invoked by Argentina, the Committee sets out below Article 8 of the BIT:\n\n\"1. Any dispute regarding an investment between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall, to the extent possible, be settled through friendly consultation between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, it may be submitted to the competent judicial or administrative courts of the Party in whose territory the investment is made.\n\n3. Where, after eighteen months from the date of notice of commencement of proceedings before the courts mentioned in paragraph 2, the dispute between an investor and one of the Contracting Parties has not been resolved, it may be submitted to international arbitration\"\n\n17.\n\nArgentina noted that the majority of the Tribunal recognized in paragraph 89 of the Award that Article 8(3) of the BIT contains a general condition subject to no exception. Based on that recognition, Argentina concluded that under Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the parties.4 Argentina considered that notwithstanding the recognition of that general condition, the majority of the Tribunal was wrong in concluding that Impregilo \"... could choose not to meet the requirement demanding prior submission of disputes to domestic courts by invoking the most favored nation (MFN) clause contained in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT,\" because it effectively authorized Impregilo to benefit from the provisions in the Argentina-US BIT, which does not require prior submission of the dispute to the administrative or judicial courts of Argentina.5 According to Argentina, in coming to this decision, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers \"... in exercising its jurisdiction without the condition for consent having been satisfied...\"6 It also stated that the Tribunal \"... failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based, and also seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"7 The reference to the alleged serious departure from the fundamental rule of procedure is also expressed in paragraphs 29 and 54 of its Reply.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 22 and 24; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 31 and 36\n\nId., \u00b6 27\n\nId., \u00b628\n\nId., \u00b6 28\n\n18.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal\u2019s action, as described in the preceding paragraph, sets out the grounds for annulment contained in Article 52(1)(b),(d), and (e) of the ICSID Convention and \"... it even de facto abrogated a provision of the Treaty.\"8\n\nId., \u00b6 28\n\n19.\n\nArgentina subdivided its first argument entitled \"The Tribunal manifestly exceeded the limits of its competence\" into several parts: \"failure to state reasons,\" \"manifest excess of powers,\" and \"serious departure from a rule of procedure.\" The Committee shall deal with these charges in the same order in which they were put forward by Argentina.\n\n**a. Failure to state reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn developing the concept of failure to state reasons Argentina referred to Article 3.1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, which provides:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall, within its own territory, accord to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the income and activities related to such investments and to all other matters regulated by this Agreement, a treatment that is no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or investors from third-party countries.\"\n\n21.\n\nArgentina stated that \"the failure to state the reasons upon which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based is, thus, self-evident...\"9 Argentina argued that articles 8.3 and 8.5(a) of the Argentina-Italy BIT are the rules that confer jurisdiction on an ICSID Tribunal and, according to Argentina, the reference to Article 3.1 by the Tribunal did not cure the failure to state reasons in order to find jurisdiction.\n\nId., \u00b6 30\n\n22.\n\nArgentina also claimed that the majority of the Tribunal held in paragraph 99 of the Award that the term \"treatment\" in Article 3.1 of the BIT was in itself wide enough to be applicable to procedural matters. According to Argentina, the term \"treatment\" could not be a reason for the decision of the Tribunal to assert jurisdiction over the case.10\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 31 and 32\n\n23.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the majority of the Tribunal did not even refer to the first argument that Argentina stated in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, in relation to Article 3.1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. In its opinion, the Tribunal \"... never stated its reasons for claiming that an MFN clause that applies only to the treatment accorded to *investments* is applicable as well to the treatment afforded to *investors,* bearing in mind especially, in this case, that it is *investors* and not *investments* that can set the jurisdictional mechanisms into motion.\"11\n\nId., \u00b6 33\n\n24.\n\nArgentina also claimed that the majority of the Tribunal, in paragraph 100 of the Award, accepted that the phrase \"within its own territory\" used in Article 3(1) of the BIT limits the scope of the MFN clause. Despite that, according to Argentina the majority \"ruled that \u2018the question as to what legal protection Argentina shall give to foreign investors is in no way an issue over which Argentina has no power to decide, *nor is it tied to any particular territory.* The Tribunal therefore considers that the wording \u2018within its own territory\u2019 does not exclude the application of the MFN clause to dispute settlement.\u2019 Thus, the majority of the Tribunal failed to state the reasons upon which this conclusion is based or, at best, it stated genuinely contradictory reasons.\"12 Argentina also stated that this interpretation is a manifest excess of powers due to the failure to apply the express provisions of the BIT.13\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 33 and 34\n\nId., \u00b6 35\n\n25.\n\nArgentina submitted that, moreover, the Award lacks any reasons whatsoever because the Tribunal did not even perform a preliminary analysis of the conclusion expressed in paragraph 101 of the Award in which it affirmed that the requirement to first resort to domestic courts or administrative agencies is a less favorable treatment for investors.14\n\nId., \u00b6 36\n\n26.\n\nIn relation to paragraph 102 of the Award, Argentina claims that the Tribunal acknowledged that several BITs signed by that Nation require an 18-month waiting period, is an indication that Argentina did not intend such requirement to be replaced via MFN clauses in those treaties. \"However, it reached the conclusion that \u2018the argument becomes less persuasive in the present case, because the Italy-Argentina BIT (signed on 22 May 1990) preceded the Argentina-US BIT (signed on 14 November 1991).\u2019 Once again in this case, the majority of the Tribunal failed to state the reasons upon which its decision was based, since the Argentina-US BIT came into force *before* the Argentina-Italy BIT.\"15\n\nId., \u00b6 38\n\n27.\n\nArgentina noted that the majority of the Tribunal, after referring to certain decisions concerning the application of the MFN clause to jurisdictional issues, and noting the lack of uniformity on the approach to this matter, held in paragraph 108 of the Award that \"in cases where the MFN clause has referred to \u2018all matters\u2019 or \u2018any matter\u2019 regulated In the BIT, there has been near-unanimity In finding that the clause covered the dispute settlement rules\". On this basis, the majority of the Tribunal reached the conclusion that Impregilo is entitled to rely, in this respect, on the dispute settlement rules in the Argentina-US BIT. According to Argentina, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion regarding the \"near-unanimity\" of the decisions on these matters is erroneous, because \"there is no principle of *stare decisis* in the field of international arbitration. Therefore the alleged majority of the decisions of Tribunals on the matter cannot be considered as a valid basis for this decision.\"16 Moreover, according to Argentina the majority of the Tribunal did not consider whether the reasons for the other tribunals\u2019 decisions it referred to were correct.17\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 38 and 39\n\nId., \u00b6 40\n\n28.\n\nIn its Reply, Argentina stressed that various committees have insisted that annulment for failure to state the reasons for the decision applies where such failure might have affected the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion.18\n\nReply, \u00b6 18\n\n**b. Manifest excess of powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nArgentina claimed that the above facts are also a manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal given that it lacked the power to rely on case law\u2014which is nonbinding and is not a source of law\u2014 and instead should rely upon its own interpretation of the rules.19\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 43\n\n30.\n\nArgentina also noted that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by asserting jurisdiction over the dispute without Impregilo having met the mandatory requirements provided in the BIT in order to give consent. According to Argentina, this excess of power is manifest from a plain reading of the Award.20\n\nId., \u00b6 44\n\n31.\n\nArgentina emphasized that where a tribunal fails to act within the scope of its jurisdiction, the excess of powers is always manifest.21\n\nId., \u00b6 43, 44 and 46\n\n32.\n\nArgentina stated that \"[t]he MFN clause in the Argentina-Italy BIT does not allow the tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction over disputes with regard to which consent has not been given by the host State [of the investment], and that is the case here[...].\"22 It also added that the MFN clause cannot be allowed to fundamentally modify the dispute settlement method set forth in the BIT, as the Tribunal did.\n\nId., \u00b6 47\n\n33.\n\nArgentina further argued that \"... the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the relevant law\"23 and stated that \"... the majority of the Tribunal began by recognizing that prior submission of disputes to the local courts is a mandatory requirement for the submission of those disputes to an ICSID arbitral tribunal. However, when referring to Impregilo\u2019s failure to meet it, such majority simply dismissed that *mandatory* requirement.\"24\n\nId., \u00b6 51\n\nId., \u00b6 52\n\n34.\n\nIn its Reply Argentina stated that, based on annulment decisions rendered by various Committees, the excess of powers by a Tribunal is always manifest when it concerns matters of jurisdiction. Argentina claimed that \"...the manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal is absolutely clear and self-evident, among other things, because the excess of powers by a tribunal is always manifest when it concerns matters of jurisdiction.\" Argentina also stated that \"... the Committee must determine whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction or not \u2014by applying the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to interpret the applicable instruments\u2014 since, if it lacked jurisdiction, then it manifestly exceeded its powers\".25\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 13.\n\n35.\n\nArgentina also argued in its Reply that the Tribunal determined that Impregilo failed to meet the requirement of Article 8(3) of the BIT and that Article 3(1) of that treaty cannot remedy the deficiency since it is not a jurisdictional clause and also, it only applies to investments and not to investors.26 It also stated that Impregilo breached the obligation under the BIT to submit the case to the local courts for a period of 18 months and clarified that this requirement does not mean that in that period the dispute should be resolved by the Argentine courts. What Article 8(3) of the BIT provides is that, if the dispute is not settled within that period, the investor may resort to international arbitration. Additionally, it concluded that the only legitimate interpreters of the BIT are Argentina and Italy.27\n\nId., \u00b6 32\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 42, 47 and 48\n\n**c. Serious departure from a rule of procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn its Memorial on Annulment Argentina claimed a serious departure from a rule of procedure because the Tribunal \"... did not observe the consent of the States Parties to the Treaty\"28 by not applying the condition of prior submission to local courts. It noted that this departure from a rule of procedure is serious since if the Tribunal had followed the principles set forth in the Treaty, then the outcome of this arbitration would have been substantially different.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 53\n\n37.\n\nIt also argued that the Tribunal \"... failed to render a decision on the compliance by Impregilo with the dispute settlement provisions contained in the Argentina-United States BIT or on Argentina\u2019s fundamental arguments, such as that referring to the fact that the MFN clause only applies to the \u2018investments\u2019 and not \u2018investors.\u2019 In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal must be deemed to have seriously departed from a rule of procedure...\"29\n\nId., \u00b6 54\n\n**2. The Tribunal manifestly exceeded the material limits of its competence**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nArgentina also argued that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded the material limits of its competence by admitting the indirect claim of Impregilo. It exercised a \"manifest excess of powers,\" \"failure to state reasons\" and \"risk of double recovery in indirect claims\" by accepting that the shares held by Impregilo in AGBA were investments protected under the Argentina-Italy BIT. It added that \"this type of claims is not allowed under Argentine law\" and that \"under general international law indirect actions such as those of this case are not permitted.\" Again the Committee will summarize these arguments in the same order in which they were put forward by Argentina.\n\n**a. Manifest excess of powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nArgentina stated that the Tribunal failed to consider the arguments it laid out in its Memorial on Jurisdiction and at the hearing that took place during the arbitration proceedings which \"... are therefore fully incorporated herein by reference.\"30 It said the Tribunal, without making any analysis, accepted that the shares held by Impregilo in AGBA are protected investments under the Argentina-Italy BIT and accepted that expropriation of AGBA\u2019s rights affected Impregilo rights; it also stated that the Tribunal rejected, without stating the reason for such rejection, the objection raised by Argentina with regard to its material competence.31\n\nId., \u00b6 55\n\nId., \u00b6 56\n\n40.\n\nArgentina also claimed that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising its jurisdiction over Impregilo\u2019s claims for damages, specifically claims arising from the Concession Contract entered into by the Province of Buenos Aires, to which Impregilo was not a party.32 Argentina also submitted that the Tribunal mistakenly regarded Impregilo and AGBA as if they were a single entity. For example, in the Award it considered whether or not \"AGBA was given fair and equitable treatment;\"33 and the Tribunal was inconsistent when it indicated that AGBA is not a protected investor under the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT.34\n\nId., \u00b6 58\n\nId., \u00b6 60\n\nId., \u00b6 62\n\n41.\n\nArgentina insisted that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in exercising jurisdiction over the claims for alleged damages caused to Impregilo because that company argued that there was interference with the rights deriving from the Concession Contract to which AGBA, and not Impregilo, was a party.35\n\nId., \u00b6 64\n\n42.\n\nArgentina claimed in its Memorial on Annulment: \"... the Tribunal allowed a shareholder to take the place of the company [AGBA], to file claims based on the actual rights of that company, and to obtain compensation for the alleged infringement of those rights.\"36\n\nId., \u00b6 65\n\n43.\n\nArgentina claimed that the Tribunal exercised its jurisdiction over the rights that belonged to AGBA (not Impregilo) and so it manifestly exceeded its powers.37\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 64 to 71\n\n44.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal\u2019s decision to admit its jurisdiction over Impregilo\u2019s claims based on alleged rights of AGBA is inconsistent with the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT because these bodies of law do not provide for the possibility that a shareholder can claim for alleged rights of a local company.38\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 70 and 71\n\n**b. Failure to state reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nAccording to Argentina, \"the Tribunal failed to specify how Impregilo could assert rights relating to the Concession Contract.\"39 It added: \"... the Tribunal had acknowledged that Impregilo could not assert the rights vested in AGBA. The contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning [in this case] is manifest.\"40\n\nId., \u00b6 74\n\nId., \u00b6 74\n\n46.\n\nArgentina also claimed that the following conclusion of the Tribunal is unfounded \"... if AGBA was subjected to expropriation or unfair treatment with respect to its concession... such action must also be considered to have affected Impregilo\u2019s rights as an investor, rights that were protected under the BIT.\"41\n\nId., \u00b6 75\n\n47.\n\nArgentina concluded its discussion of indirect claims by asserting that the Tribunal referred to the second objection to jurisdiction raised by it in only four paragraphs of the Award. It added that in paragraph 140 the Tribunal based its reasoning on case law which, in Argentina\u2019s opinion, \"does not constitute valid grounds for the decision.\"42 In its Reply, Argentina also indicated that the Tribunal reproduced the arguments of the parties and did not base its decision on the issue of indirect claims.43\n\nId., \u00b6 75\n\nReply, \u00b6 69\n\n**c. Risk of double recovery in filing indirect claims**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nArgentina noted that the Tribunal recognized the existence of a legal problem by \"the risk of double recovery\" by AGBA and Impregilo. According to Argentina, with the real possibility that this problem could exist, the Tribunal \"... went on to speculate about the possibility of it being resolved, in the future, by someone.\"44 Argentina further stated that the possibility of there being double recovery \"... must be avoided through legal considerations established for these purposes... and through the correct interpretation of the applicable instruments. This is not what the Tribunal did.\"45\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 76\n\nId., \u00b6 77; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 70 to 72\n\n49.\n\nEven though, in strict logic, the arguments contained in sections (d) and (e) below should be part of Argentina\u2019s disagreement with the acceptance by the Tribunal of the indirect claims described in paragraphs 38-43, the Committee will follow the order in which Argentina presented its arguments.\n\n**d. These type of claims are not allowed under Argentine law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nArgentina claims that derivative or indirect actions are \"not provided for under Argentine law, which is part of the applicable law in accordance with Article 8(7) of the BIT.\"46 It added that, \"[u]nder Argentine law, a shareholder may not file any action on its own behalf and for its own benefit for the purpose of receiving compensation for alleged losses in proportion to its shareholding,\"47 and explained that Argentine law provides for a whole series of actions which were not used by Impregilo.48\n\nId., \u00b6 78\n\nId., \u00b6 81\n\nId., \u00b6 82; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 73 to 76\n\n**e. Under international law, indirect actions such as those of this case are not permitted**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nArgentina argued that \"[u]nder international law, in order for derivative claims to be admitted, they must be expressly provided for, since they constitute an exception to the general principle that no one can bring a claim on behalf of another.\"49\n\nId., \u00b6 84; Reply, \u00b6 77\n\n52.\n\nFollowing this line of argument, Argentina stated that in order to make the claim, Impregilo should be the owner of the rights invoked. Argentina based its arguments on the words of the International Court of Justice, stating that there are other treaties in which the legality of an indirect claim is expressly provided for. In its Reply, moreover, it stated that Impregilo and the Tribunal made the mistake of not providing reasons and simply referred to decided cases.\n\n**3. The Tribunal abrogated the normative content of the standard requiring the investment to be accorded fair and equitable treatment, by failing to clarify its meaning**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nArgentina's third argument is that the Tribunal failed to clarify the content of the standard requiring the investment to be accorded fair and equitable treatment, and the notion of that standard in the Argentina-Italy BIT, and therefore implicitly abrogated the normative content of the standard. It further argued that the Tribunal contradicted itself in its reasoning leading to the conclusion that Argentina violated such standard.50 It also stated the following: \"Upon drawing a distinction between two different approaches regarding the scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard and apparently adopting neither of them, the Tribunal deliberately failed to establish the criterion applied in eventually holding Argentina liable for the violation of the alleged legitimate expectations.\"51\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 87 and 91\n\nId., \u00b6 90\n\n54.\n\nArgentina argued that the Tribunal linked the fair and equitable treatment and investor expectations, but there is nothing in the BIT referring to expectations or demonstrating that the Contracting States meant to protect them. It concluded that holding a State liable based on \"alleged\" expectations entails a manifest excess of powers.52\n\nId., \u00b6 91\n\n55.\n\nArgentina also stated that \"... the Tribunal makes a number of statements that are not only implausible in light of the established facts...but are also in conflict with other submissions contained in the Award.\" (translation of the Committee.)53\n\nId., \u00b6 94\n\n56.\n\nIn its Reply it insisted \"How is it possible for a tribunal to hold a country liable for the violation of a Treaty standard if the content of such standard is not defined first?\"54\n\nReply, \u00b6 83\n\n57.\n\nIn its Reply Argentina concluded, on this argument, that because the Tribunal \"... held Argentina liable for the alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard both contradicting itself and failing to state the reasons for its decision, the Award should be annulled...\"55\n\nReply, \u00b6 103\n\n58.\n\nArgentina went on to present three lines of reasoning under this section: a) \"The Tribunal acknowledged that since the beginning of the concession period, ABGA had experienced difficulties in complying with its obligations under the Concession Contract\"; b) \"In arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal relied on Presidential Decree No. 878/03, which established a New Regulatory Framework, despite the fact that such decree could only be applied with AGBA\u2019s consent, and that, in any event, it was basically never applied\"; and c) \"the Tribunal recognized the Concessionaire\u2019s contributory fault.\"\n\n59.\n\nIn the first part of this argument Argentina explained that the Tribunal, in paragraph 311 of the Award, recognized that from the beginning AGBA had difficulties in complying with its obligations under the Concession Contract. According to Argentina, this shows that the \"economic and financial equation\" was already disrupted before they knew the measures challenged by Impregilo. According to Argentina, the alteration of the contractual equilibrium was caused by the actions of the concessionaire, but the Tribunal, contradicting itself, held Argentina liable for the alteration of that equilibrium.56\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 98 to 100.\n\n60.\n\nAs for the second part of its argument, Argentina explained that the aforementioned Presidential Decree 878/03, which established a new regulatory framework, was never applied to AGBA and this was recognized by Impregilo\u2019s witness Albarracin. In the opinion of Argentina, the Tribunal contradicted itself when it claimed violation of fair and equitable treatment in the application of that rule and indicated, in paragraph 291 of the Award, that the legitimate expectations cannot be that the State will never modify the legal framework but that investors must be protected if there are unreasonable modifications of that legal framework.57\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 103 to 106.\n\n61.\n\nIn the latter part of its argument Argentina noted that the Tribunal recognized in paragraph 377 of the Award the contributory fault of AGBA and the Province of Buenos Aires, which is inconsistent with condemning Argentina for violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.58\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 107 to 110.\n\n62.\n\nArgentina also argued that the Tribunal recognized the contributory fault of AGBA and therefore there are contradictions and inconsistencies in the Award. After quoting paragraph 377 of the Award, which states: \"The failure of the concession can therefore be ascribed partly to events for which AGBA stood the risk and partly to acts or failures by the Province,\" Argentina stated that \"... the Tribunal thus made another unfounded statement, which constitutes a ground for annulment...\"59\n\nId., \u00b6 109\n\n63.\n\nArgentina said in its Reply that the Tribunal \"... based on a series of contradictions and unreasonable statements\" concludes that Argentina violated the fair and equitable treatment standard and that this way of proceeding is grounds for annulment.60\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b686 and 103\n\n**4. The Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based and exceeded its powers in deciding on the defenses based on the extraordinary situation faced by Argentina**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nAs part of its fourth argument, Argentina stated that the Tribunal recognized in several paragraphs of the Award that the emergency legislation was enacted in reaction to a very serious economic crisis in the country and that drastic measures were required because the crisis was critical and alarming. However, contradicting its own position, the Tribunal held Argentina liable for the emergency measures adopted, holding that Argentina failed to restore a reasonable equilibrium in the concession, and thus aggravated its situation and violated the Argentina-Italy BIT.61\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6111 and 112\n\n65.\n\nArgentina concluded that \"the Tribunal failed to consider the measures adopted in light of the international (customary and contractual) provisions that apply in emergency situations. Therefore, it failed to rely on the applicable law, thus manifestly exceeding its powers.\"62\n\nId., \u00b6 114\n\n66.\n\nIn its Reply Argentina stated that the severity of the crisis was recognized by the Tribunal, but that \"...upon arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal\u2014contradicting itself, that is, rendering an unfounded award\u2014held Argentina liable for the emergency measures adopted.\"63\n\nReply, \u00b6 106\n\n67.\n\nArgentina divided its fourth argument in two parts entitled: \"The Tribunal did not apply Article 4 of the BIT\" and \"Consideration of the state of necessity under customary international law.\" The Committee will refer to them in the following paragraphs:\n\n**a. The Tribunal did not apply Article 4 of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nArticle 4 of the Argentina-Italy BIT states:\n\n\"Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses... owing to... a state of national emergency, or other similar political economic events shall be accorded, by such other Party in whose territory the investment was made, treatment no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or legal entities or to investors of any third country as regards damages.\"\n\n69.\n\nIn connection with the provisions of this Article, Argentina claimed that the Tribunal recognized, in paragraph 339 of the Award, that the crisis that the country experienced in 2002 should be interpreted as a political-economic occurrence equivalent to a national state of emergency. Therefore, Article 4 should apply to the case. However, in contradiction with its prior reasoning, the Tribunal concluded that this provision was not applicable.64 According to Argentina the interpretation of the Tribunal was unfounded depriving the abovementioned Article 4 of any useful effect.65 In doing so, states Argentina, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to apply the applicable law.66\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 115 and 116\n\nId., \u00b6 118\n\nId., \u00b6 120\n\n**b. Consideration of the state of necessity under customary international law**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nArgentina cited paragraphs 346, 349, and 350 of the Award in which the Tribunal recognized the gravity of the crisis that hit Argentina and that there was a serious and imminent threat to the public interest. However, according to Argentina, the Tribunal concluded that that nation contributed significantly to the situation of necessity and, for that reason, could not invoke it as a defense. Argentina further noted that the Tribunal relied on the report of Mr. Edwards, Impregilo\u2019s expert, without establishing the legal criteria applied in coming to its conclusion.67\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 121 to 126\n\n71.\n\nArgentina also stated that \"In sum, the position adopted by the Tribunal renders the necessity defense meaningless, as it would be sufficient for an economist to take the opposite view (and there will always be one willing to do so) for the state of necessity to become inadmissible.\"68\n\nId., \u00b6 129\n\n72.\n\nArgentina argued that the Tribunal failed to take the evidence submitted by it into consideration, including reports prepared by economic and legal experts that demonstrated that the measures adopted were necessary, but also that the report of Impregilo\u2019s expert was flawed.69 Argentina also indicated the reasons for stating that the expert contradicted himself at the hearing and was not an independent expert.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 134 and 135\n\n73.\n\nArgentina concluded that the Tribunal, by relying solely on a report, and failing to specify the legal criteria on which it was based, failed to state the reasons and seriously departed from a rule of procedure.70 In its Reply, Argentina insisted that the Tribunal \"... seriously departed from the rules of procedure in failing to consider all the significant body of evidence submitted by the Argentine Republic...\".71\n\nId., \u00b6 140\n\nReply, \u00b6 136\n\n74.\n\nFinally, Argentina stated \"Furthermore, in this regard, there is a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal, as it failed to rely upon the applicable law, which includes the notion of state of necessity.\"72\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 140\n\n**5. Compensation**\n-------------------\n\n75.\n\nIn its plea related to the decision on compensation Argentina argued failure to state reasons, manifest excess of powers and a departure from fundamental rules of procedure. The Committee will address these issues in the following paragraphs.\n\n**a. Failure to state reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nArgentina cited paragraph 375 of the Award where the Tribunal said it had not been established categorically that the concession granted to AGBA would have been profitable, even in the absence of state actions allegedly contrary to the principle of fair and equitable treatment. In light of this, according to Argentina, the Tribunal had no discretion to determine the amount of damages.73 Argentina added that even in those cases where the assessment of damages is made on a discretionary basis, the Arbitral Tribunal must assess the evidence produced. According to Argentina, in this case the Tribunal failed to address the evidence submitted on damages.74\n\nId., \u00b6 143.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6145\n\n77.\n\nArgentina stated \"... even in those cases where a tribunal is deemed to have discretion over the assessment of damages, the committees have established that, in making that assessment, the tribunal must refer to the relevance and evaluation of the evidence produced. In this case, even though the Tribunal found that \u2018it is incumbent on Impregilo to prove that it suffered the damage for which it asks to be compensated,\u2019 it failed to address the evidence produced in the damages section of the Award, thus disregarding the evidence submitted in relation to the amounts invested.\"75\n\nId., \u00b6 145\n\n**b. Manifest excess of powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that Impregilo should prove damages allegedly suffered but, according to Argentina, the Tribunal \"... did not analyze any of the alleged losses invoked by Impregilo.\"76 According to Argentina, the Tribunal awarded Impregilo compensation that had no causal connection with the disputed measures, with the evidence produced, nor with the applicable law; it only cited an award, and, Argentina insisted that case law is not a source of law. The Tribunal held that Impregilo should be placed in the same position as it would have been, had Argentina\u2019s unfair and inequitable treatment not occurred. Actually the profitability of the investment had not been proved and, according to Argentina, awarding compensation to Impregilo for the total amount allegedly invested by the company, placed it in a better position than it would have been, had Argentina not taken any action.77 According to Argentina the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is contrary to the applicable law and is therefore tantamount to a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal.\n\nId., \u00b6 146\n\nId., \u00b6 149\n\n**c. Serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nArgentina noted that in this case there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure because the Tribunal awarded the damages claimed by Impregilo, without considering the defenses raised by Argentina. According to Argentina, the Tribunal stated that it had no reason to doubt the figures of Impregilo\u2019s experts without even considering the defenses raised by Argentina, which clearly warrants the annulment of the award.\n\n80.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal did not consider the defenses it raised as to the amounts that Impregilo invested in AGBA. \"There is no doubt that this departure is \u2018serious\u2019 since, had it not taken place, the Tribunal would have reached a substantially different conclusion from that of the decision.\"78\n\nId., \u00b6 155\n\n81.\n\nAt the bottom of page 182 of its Memorial on Annulment and in its Reply, Argentina expanded on this argument and said:\n\n\"In the present case, Argentina presented numerous challenges regarding the alleged amounts invested by Impregilo in AGBA. Indeed, valuation experts Dapena and Coloma noted that (i) the funds actually contributed by AGBA should be denominated in Argentine pesos; (ii) only a portion of the capital that was contributed and paid in translated into investments in fixed assets; (iii) the value of those assets decreased substantially in terms of US Dollars in 2002, owing to the devaluation; (iv) the investments made, in 2000, started to be recovered as from 2001, to 2006, through operating revenues, and the amounts recovered should be subtracted from the historical value of AGBA\u2019s contributions and; (v) should the historical cost method be applied, the more objective approach would be to consider the Financial Statements submitted by AGBA as of December 2005 and to take the net value of fixed assets. Such net value, restated in US dollars, and taking into account Impregilo\u2019s participation in AGBA, adds up to USD 3.6 million.\"79\n\nReply, \u00b6 165\n\n82.\n\nArgentina concluded in its Reply that the object and purpose of an ICSID annulment proceeding is to control the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process in all its facets: the integrity of the tribunal, the integrity of the procedure and the integrity of the award.80 It argued that \"Ignoring the defences raised by one party and inverting the burden of proof is a ground for annulment...\" It also said \"... this departure is \u2018serious\u2019 since, had it not taken place, the Tribunal would have reached a substantially different conclusion from that of the decision.\"81\n\nId., \u00b6 28\n\nId., \u00b6 168\n\n83.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons Argentina requested the annulment of the Award and asked the Committee to order that Impregilo pay the costs of Argentina, as well as the costs incurred in the annulment proceedings by Argentina and ICSID.82\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 156\n\n**B. IMPREGILO\u2019S RESPONSE TO ARGENTINA\u2019S ARGUMENTS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThis section contains a summary of the arguments submitted by Impregilo. All arguments were carefully considered by the Committee and the fact that one or more specific allegations are not summarized does not mean that they were not considered by the Committee.\n\n85.\n\nImpregilo stated that Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention should be construed in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. It further argued that the five grounds for annulment set forth in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention relate to the integrity of the arbitration. It added that nothing in this Article suggests that annulment allows a substantive review of the Award, as the annulment is not an appeal. It emphasized that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention show that the fundamental objective of the system was to ensure the finality of arbitration awards and the first Secretary General of ICSID characterized annulment as a remedy concerning procedural errors.83\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 31 to 33\n\n86.\n\nImpregilo also noted that the annulment process is not a mechanism created in order to check if there was any alleged misapplication of the applicable law or a mistake in fact. It stated that the Legal Committee involved in the drafting of the ICSID Convention indicated that even a manifestly incorrect application of the law is not a ground for annulment. It also argued, based on several decisions on annulment, that the annulment system is intended to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings and the legitimacy of the award, not the outcome of the arbitration proceedings, or the correctness of the award.84\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 34 to 37\n\n87.\n\nImpregilo stated that according to the ordinary meaning of the terms, Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention refers to the excess of power that is manifest, that is, obvious and clear, discernible without the need for an elaborate analysis of the award.85\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 38 to 40\n\n88.\n\nAccording to Impregilo, Argentina did not state the reasons for its claim that the Tribunal exceeded its powers, and insisted that the Tribunal should rule on its jurisdiction. It stated that \"There is nothing in the Convention\u2019s *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* that supports a different interpretation. Moreover, under the *kompetenz-kompetenz* principle, ICSID tribunals have the express power to decide their own jurisdiction. It follows that their decision should not be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) unless the exercise of that power is manifestly beyond any reasonable interpretation of that power.\"86 It argued that \"Only when a tribunal deliberately and manifestly refuses to apply the applicable law can an award be annulled on the grounds of manifest excess of power.\"87\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 41, 44 and 45\n\nId. \u00b6 46\n\n89.\n\nImpregilo cited Professor Schreuer who stated the following:\n\n\"... misapplication of the applicable law...did not constitute an annullable error, even if it is a \u2018manifest error of law,\u2019 provided it is not of such a magnitude as to amount to a veritable non-application of the proper law as a whole.\"88\n\nId., \u00b6 48\n\n90.\n\nImpregilo argued that the ICSID Convention provides solutions where the Tribunal fails to address a question in the award: a supplementary decision or interpretation of the award. Argentina chose neither of those options. It noted that other Annulment Committees have indicated that whether the reasoning is incorrect or unconvincing is beyond the authority of the Committee and is not grounds for annulment.89\n\nId., \u00b6 50 to 52\n\n91.\n\nBased on the criterion reiterated by Professor Schreuer, Impregilo stated that for a procedural violation to constitute a ground for annulment it must be serious and relate to a fundamental rule of procedure. It added, based on several decisions on nullity, that the fundamental rules of procedure are equal treatment of the parties, the right to be heard, the right to an independent and impartial tribunal, the burden of proof and the necessity of deliberations among the members of the Tribunal.90\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 53 to 57\n\n92.\n\nAccording to Impregilo, Argentina\u2019s application for annulment does not meet the threshold for annulment of the Award. It is an attempt to re-argue the merits of the case and replace the vote of the majority with the dissenting opinion.91\n\nId., \u00b6 58\n\n93.\n\nImpregilo, in sum, answered Argentina\u2019s allegations as follows:\n\n**1. The Tribunal did not exceed its powers**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nImpregilo stated that there is no prohibition against including most favored nation clauses in investment treaties that extend to dispute settlement provisions. According to Impregilo, the Tribunal gave several ample reasons as the basis of its interpretation and there is no element that constitutes a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal. It noted that the Tribunal considered and rejected each of the arguments of Argentina and, although the Tribunal did not rely exclusively on existing jurisprudence, if it did, it would have been sufficient grounds on which to base the Award, for relying on jurisprudence means that the Tribunal agrees with the reasoning in the cited cases and that in itself constitutes a statement of reasons.92\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 99 to 102\n\n95.\n\nImpregilo also noted that Argentina argued that the interpretation of the most favored nation clause by the Tribunal was incorrect and, therefore, constitutes a manifest excess of powers. Impregilo stressed that, in order to constitute grounds for annulment, the excess must be manifest. It also stated that Article 53 of the ICSID Convention provides that the substance of an ICSID award may not be reviewed and this rule makes no exception for jurisdictional decisions.93\n\nId., \u00b6 103\n\n96.\n\nImpregilo also criticized the fact that Argentina cited legal authorities that were issued after the Tribunal issued its Award and requested that they not be considered by this Committee.94\n\nId., \u00b6 105 and footnote No. 127\n\n97.\n\nIn its Rejoinder Impregilo reiterated that based on the drafting history of the ICSID Convention, to be grounds for annulment, the excess of powers must be manifest as various Annulment Committees have confirmed.95\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 10 to 13\n\n**2. The Tribunal did not depart from any rule of procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nAccording to Impregilo, to meet the request of Argentina, the Committee would necessarily have to determine whether the decision of the Tribunal was correct, which clearly exceeds its mandate. According to Impregilo, the 18-month-domestic court requirement (Article 8(3) of the BIT) is related only to admissibility and \"it does not affect the legitimacy of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the claim.96\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 107 and 108\n\n**3. The Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by asserting jurisdiction over the investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nImpregilo said Argentina\u2019s claim regarding the *jus standi* is a request for review of the merits of the Award and not a decision on any potential violations of the fundamental principles of law.97\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 110 and 111\n\n100.\n\nImpregilo insisted that most Committees have interpreted manifest excess of powers of a Tribunal to mean an excess that is so egregious or self-evident that it is discernible without the need for analyzing the award. It added that jurisdictional issues are not subject to \"... heightened scrutiny.\"98\n\nId., \u00b6 114\n\n**4. The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its award**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nImpregilo said the Tribunal devoted more than six pages to explaining the Parties\u2019 arguments and summarizing the authorities supporting their respective arguments. The Tribunal cited several arbitral awards and, based on them, used analogies and laid out syllogisms, which is the most common form of legal reasoning.99\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 120 to 122\n\n102.\n\nIn relation to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Article 4 of the BIT in respect of recovery of damages, Impregilo said the Tribunal provided reasons for its interpretation and therefore did not commit any annullable error regarding this holding.100\n\nId., \u00b6 135\n\n103.\n\nImpregilo also noted that the Tribunal expressed detailed findings to support its ruling on the necessity plea. It added that the Tribunal extensively analyzed Argentina\u2019s contribution to the country\u2019s crisis.101\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6I4O to 156\n\n**5. The Tribunal did not fail to apply the applicable law**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nImpregilo stated that the Tribunal did not apply the report of Professor Edward presented in this case, as the applicable law, as claimed by Argentina. In the opinion of Impregilo, the Tribunal cited the report and its supporting evidence and identified four specific situations which in the opinion of the Tribunal had contributed to Argentina\u2019s \"situation of necessity.\"102\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 157 and 158\n\n**6. The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its damages award**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nImpregilo stated that \"... annulment committees afford significant discretion to tribunals\u2019 reasoning. That is not a failure to apply the annulment standard correctly; it is, rather, a reflection of the fact that the requirement to state reasons is inherently more flexible in the damage context due to the discretionary nature of the exercise.\"103 It cited several decisions of annulment committees on this subject.\n\nId., \u00b6 168\n\n106.\n\nImpregilo noted that the Tribunal discussed in the Award the damage models of the experts of both sides and explained why it would not adopt those models.104\n\nId., \u00b6 172\n\n107.\n\nImpregilo criticized Argentina\u2019s position that contradictory reasons in an award are sufficient in themselves to annul the award. Impregilo cited the decisions issued by annulment committees in the Kl\u00f4ckner I, Rumeli, and Vivendi I cases, in which those committees referred to contradictions in the awards that were questioned.105\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 14 to 16\n\n108.\n\nImpregilo stated in its Rejoinder that the Tribunal did analyze the evidence presented by Argentina and as a basis for its claim it quoted paragraphs 372 and 378 of the Award.106\n\nId., \u00b6 92\n\n**7. The Tribunal did not exceed its powers when it awarded damages**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAccording to Impregilo, the Tribunal cited and discussed the fundamental legal principle of international law concerning damages (the Chorz\u00f3w principle) and held that the measures taken by Argentina contributed to the concession\u2019s failure. Regarding Argentina\u2019s argument that the Tribunal did not consider the risk of double recovery (for Impregilo and AGBA), Impregilo stated that was obviously not a legitimate annulment argument.\n\n110.\n\nImpregilo responded to Argentina\u2019s allegation that, supposedly, the Tribunal did not respect the international legal principle that damages must be certain and proven and put Impregilo in a better situation than that in which it would have been but for the measures taken by Argentina. It stated that even if these assertions were true (which they are not), they would not constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal.107\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 174 to 177\n\n**8. The Tribunal did not depart from any rules of procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nRegarding Argentina\u2019s allegation that the Tribunal failed to take into account the items of evidence that Argentina offered as a counter to the testimony of Professor Edward (Impregilo\u2019s expert), because the Tribunal did not expressly mention them, Impregilo stated that Tribunals are not obliged to refer specifically to each piece of evidence introduced into the record.108\n\nId. \u00b6 159\n\n112.\n\nImpregilo also noted that, even if true that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidence disputing the amounts of money that Impregilo invested, this does not constitute an error that would lead to annulment of the Award.109\n\nId., \u00b6 179\n\n113.\n\nImpregilo concluded that the Tribunal committed no error capable of annulling the Award and requested that the Committee deny each of Argentina\u2019s grounds for annulment. It also asked the Committee, under Articles 52(4) and 61(2) of the Convention, to order Argentina to bear all costs, fees, and expenses of these proceedings, plus interest.\n\n**C. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Committee has carefully considered the annulment claim submitted by Argentina. In its submissions, Argentina raised five \"grounds for annulment of the award,\" which were summarized by the Committee in section III.A of this decision. Following the same order proposed by Argentina as to the \"grounds\" could result in unnecessary repetitions as each \"ground\" or argument made by Argentina was then divided into sections that repeat the grounds for annulment governed by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. For this reason, the Committee, after carefully studying each argument or \"ground\" for annulment, will follow the order in which Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention enumerates the grounds for annulment applicable to the case and refer under each section of article 52 (1) to each of the \"grounds\" raised by Argentina.\n\n115.\n\nAs stated, to begin the analysis of the merits of the application for annulment, the Committee will quote the rules governing the matter, and express some general comments.\n\n116.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention lists the grounds for annulment as follows:\n\n\"(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"\n\n117.\n\nThe first paragraph of Article 53 of this Convention provides:\n\n\"(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\"\n\n118.\n\nArticle 53 sets out the fundamental features of an arbitration award, reiterating the well-established doctrine of finality in arbitration and the binding effect of the awards on the parties. The only recourse against the award available to the parties is limited to what is set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. No appeal is allowed by said Article, which indicates clearly that an Annulment Committee should not review the merits. This approach is rightly accepted by both parties here. Given this framework, this Committee concludes that in balancing these principles and interests, annulment is an exceptional recourse that should respect the finality of the award. Thus, the grounds for annulment should be interpreted as being exhaustive and restrictive. This conclusion is consistent with those of various committees which have asserted repeatedly that the role of an Annulment Committee is restricted to assessing the legitimacy of the award, to examining the integrity of the proceedings, and not to correct the award.110 The Committee agrees with the following statements of Professor Aron Broches:\n\n\"Annulment is an essential but exceptional remedy. It is well understood that the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annul led... After these determinations have been made on the basis of objective legal analysis, the ad hoc committees may be faced with the delicate final task of weighing the conflicting claims of finality of the award, on the one hand and, on the other, of protection of parties against procedural injustice, as defined in the five subparagraphs of Article 52(1). This requires that an ad hoc committee be able to exercise a measure of discretion in ruling on applications for annulment.\"111\n\nM.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v.

Each Contracting Party shall, within its own territory accord to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the income and activities related to such investments and to all other matters regulated by this Agreement, a treatment that is no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or investors from third-party countries.\n\n2. The provisions set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to advantages and privileges accorded by either Contracting Party to any third country by virtue of that Party\u2019s binding obligations that derive from its membership in a customs or economic union, common market, or free trade area, or as a result of regional or subregional agreements, multilateral international economic agreements or double taxation agreements, or any other tax-related arrangements or agreements to facilitate cross border trade.\"\n\n123.\n\nArticle 8 of the BIT provides in its relevant part:\n\n\"1. Any dispute relating to an investment between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall, to the extent possible, be settled through friendly consultation between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, it may be submitted to the competent judicial or administrative courts of the Party in whose territory the investment is made.\n\n3. Where after eighteen months from the date of notice of commencement of proceedings before the courts mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the dispute between an investor and one of the Contracting Parties has not been resolved, it may be referred to international arbitration...\".\n\n124.\n\nThe Committee will now discuss the first ground of annulment alleged in this proceeding: the manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**1. Manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nFrom the decisions of various *ad hoc* Committees, it is clear and not disputed by the parties in this case, that manifest excess of powers may relate to jurisdictional or substantive issues. Manifest excess of powers may occur when an arbitral tribunal decides on matters which the parties did not submit to it, when the tribunal failed to apply the proper law, or did not apply the law agreed upon by the parties. In those cases the excess of powers must be considered \"manifest\".\n\n126.\n\nThe Committee considers it important to quote the following about the first form of manifest excess of powers, that is when the tribunal decided on matters not submitted to it:\n\n\"... [A]d hoc committees have acknowledged the principle specifically provided by the Convention that the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence. This means that the Tribunal has the power to decide whether it has jurisdiction to hear the parties\u2019 dispute based on the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement and the jurisdictional requirements in the ICSID Convention. In light of this principle, the drafting history suggests\u2014and most *ad hoc* committees have reasoned\u2014that in order to annul an award based on a Tribunal\u2019s determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction, the excess of powers must be \u2018manifest.\u2019 However, one *ad hoc* committee found that an excess of jurisdiction or failure to exercise jurisdiction is a manifest excess of powers when it is capable of affecting the outcome of the case.\"114\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, August 10, 2012, \u00b6 89\n\n127.\n\nThe concept of \"manifest excess of powers\" has been defined by several Annulment Committees as something that is obvious, clear or self-evident; can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.115 For other Committees that concept is more complex. For example for the Committee in the Fraport case, manifest excess must be demonstrable and substantial and not doubtful. According to the Committee\u2019s decision in the *Fraport* case, \"the excess of jurisdiction should be demonstrable and substantial and not doubtful.\" \"It seems to this Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power should at once be textually obvious or substantially serious.\"116\n\nWena Hotels Limited v.

Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, \u00b6 40\n\n128.\n\nFor this Committee, it is clear that not every excess of powers could result in an annulment of an award issued under the ICSID Convention. The standard imposed by Article 52 makes it clear that an award could only be annulled if the excess of powers is \"manifest\". In the views of this Committee, the word \"manifest\" has to be given its plain meaning, in the context of the purpose of Article 52, bearing in mind the features of finality and binding effect of awards set out in Article 53. This means that the excess of power has to be obvious, self-evident, clear, flagrant and substantially serious, as found by other Committees.\n\n129.\n\nIn relation to the second form of manifest excess of powers, i.e., failure to apply the proper law, \"The drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that a Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the proper law could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that erroneous application of the law could not amount to an annullable error, even if it is manifest... there is no basis for an annulment due to an incorrect decision by a Tribunal, a principle that has been expressly recognized by many *ad hoc* committees.\"117\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, August 10, 2012, \u00b6 91\n\n130.\n\nSome annulment committees have considered that a flagrant misapplication or misinterpretation of the law may lead to annulment of an award, while others think that such an approach relates to an appeal, not an annulment.118\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, August 10, 2012, \u00b6 94\n\n131.\n\nIn the opinion of this Committee it is necessary to differentiate between a failure to apply the proper law and an error in applying the law. The first is a ground for annulment under Article 52, the second is not. Reviewing the substantive reasoning by which the Tribunal arrived at its conclusions would demand reviewing how the Tribunal applied the law or interpreted the same, resulting in the Committee acting as a court of appeal, thereby exceeding the powers granted to it by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. In order to decide whether the Tribunal misapplied or misinterpreted the law to the matter decided, the Committee would necessarily have to evaluate the facts and evidence as well as the correctness of the legal principles submitted by the parties, assessed and applied by the Tribunal. Obviously that is the function of an appellate court and not of an Annulment Committee.\n\n132.\n\nFailure to apply the law is part of the concept of manifest excess of powers and for the reasons set out above, should be self-evident, clear, obvious, flagrant and substantially serious. As stated above, this Committee agrees with the views of Prof. Schreuer that there is a difference between a failure to apply the proper law and the misapplication of the applicable law, and that the latter does not constitute grounds for annulment, even if it is a \"manifest error of law\", unless it is of such a magnitude as to amount to the non-application of the proper law as a whole.\n\n133.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee will review below Argentina\u2019s arguments on the alleged manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal.\n\n134.\n\nAs stated in paragraphs 15,17, 30, 32, and 37 above, Argentina stated that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to resolve the dispute between the parties and that it manifestly exceeded its powers when it assumed jurisdiction based on the MFN clause contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT which the majority of the Tribunal found allowed recourse to the Argentina-US BIT, which does not require prior submission to the administrative or judicial courts of Argentina.\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunals in cases that have ruled on the most favored nation clause in relation to jurisdictional issues have expressed divergent positions. In *Mafezzini* (Argentine investor) v. Spain, the Arbitration Tribunal applied this clause contained in the Argentina-Spain BIT and, based on it, referred to the provisions of the Treaty between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Chile and assumed jurisdiction.119 In *Siemens* (German investor) v. Argentina, the Tribunal, based on the most favored nation clause of the Argentina-Germany BIT had recourse to the current treaty between the Republics of Argentina and Chile and declared that it had jurisdiction to hear the case.120 In *Gas Natural* (Spanish company) v. Argentina the Tribunal, based on the MFN clause of the Argentina-Spain BIT referred to the Treaty between the United States and Argentina and also decided that it had jurisdiction.121 In the opposite direction, Argentina cited the case of ICS (UK investor) against that nation, in which the Tribunal applied the provisions of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT, denied that the MFN clause was applicable to jurisdictional issues and stated that it had no jurisdiction.122 In *Salini* (Italian investor) v. Jordan the Tribunal analyzed the MFN clause in the Italy-Jordan BIT and considered the treaties signed between Jordan and the United States and Great Britain. It held that it could not extend the procedural rights of the dispute resolution clause under those treaties to circumvent the requirement to have recourse to the mechanisms established under the investment contract.123 In the *Plama* case (Cypriot company) v. Bulgaria, the Tribunal analyzed the most favored nation clause and the treaty between Bulgaria and Finland and concluded that the claimant could not rely on other treaties signed by Bulgaria to access ICSID.124\n\nEmilio Agust\u00edn Mafezzini v. the Kingdom of Spain.

Decision on Jurisdiction, February 8, 2005.\n\n136.\n\nThe above cited decisions suggest that there are two extreme positions on this issue: one supports the application of the MFN clause to dispute resolution mechanisms as a means of access to ICSID jurisdiction, the other considers that the MFN clause cannot be given effect for jurisdictional purposes. In each particular case the wording of the Treaty, the circumstances of the dispute and the evidence and arguments submitted have had a substantial role in the decision of Tribunals as to whether or not to apply the MFN clause to jurisdictional issues. Thus, this matter should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis and it is not possible to establish, for the purposes of the annulment of an award, a general rule that an MFN clause applies or does not apply to jurisdictional issues. If the Treaty - as some do - expressly prohibits the application of the MFN clause to jurisdictional issues and the tribunal disregards such prohibition and applies the MFN clause to assume competence; or if the Treaty expressly extends the MFN clause to jurisdictional issues and the Tribunal does not assume jurisdiction, regardless of the clear wording of the clause, one could say that there is a manifest excess of powers. In such events, the mere comparison between the text of the Treaty and the decision of the tribunal could lead to the conclusion that there is an excess of powers, and that such excess would be evident.\n\n137.\n\nThe issue is different, however, when there is no express prohibition or authorization and the applicability or non-applicability of the MFN clause to jurisdictional matters requires, inter alia, an interpretation of the provisions of the given Treaty, a review of the intent of the parties and the evidence and arguments submitted in the case at hand. Such are the cases that give rise to controversy and to a division in the reasoning of the tribunals. In an article published in 2011, Professor Zachary Douglas of the University of Cambridge stated:\n\n\"In this article the author revisits the vexed question of whether the jurisdiction of an international tribunal, established in accordance with the terms of the basic treaty, can be expanded by reference to the terms of a third treaty through the investor\u2019s reliance upon the MFN clause in the basic treaty.\"125\n\nDouglas, Zachary. The MFN Clause In Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Ralls. In: Journal of International Dispute Settlement, Vol. 2, No. 1 (2011), page 97.\n\n138.\n\nProfessor Douglas concludes that the MFN clause does not extend to jurisdictional matters and adds that:\n\n\"It is notorious that this question has proved to be among the most divisive in the jurisprudence.\"126\n\nId., page 98.\n\n139.\n\nThe controversial nature of this matter is evidenced also by the fact that two respected jurists members of the Tribunal opted for the argument that, in this particular case, the MFN clause contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT permitted Impregilo to have recourse to the Argentina-US BIT that did not require submission to the administrative or judicial courts of Argentina before filing a request for arbitration. Another jurist, equally distinguished, also a member of the Tribunal, held the opposite view in a long and detailed dissenting opinion containing a thorough analysis of the MFN clause.\n\n140.\n\nFrom the discussion in the preceding paragraphs, it is clear to this Committee that the issue of whether the MFN clause in the Argentina-Italy BIT has jurisdictional effects in the circumstances of this case that allowed Impregilo to have recourse to the Argentina-US BIT, which does not require recourse to local courts before resorting to the ICSID jurisdiction, is a complex issue, subject to debate, with opposite views that were discussed by the majority and the dissenting arbitrator. Neither applying an MFN clause to jurisdictional issues nor refusing to apply it to assume jurisdiction may be considered, *per se,* as a manifest excess of powers. The Committee is being asked to review in detail and *de novo* the complex issues involved in the jurisdictional debate in this case, to support the analysis of the dissenting arbitrator and to consider that such analysis is the one to prevail, and to conclude that the majority manifestly exceeded its powers. This is not the task of the Committee. The analysis required to reach a conclusion other than the majority\u2019s would imply a new and complex analysis of the issues at stake, a review that is far from the responsibility of this Committee according to Article 52.\n\n141.\n\nFor these reasons, it is clear that this Committee has no authority to determine whether or not the Tribunal should apply Article 3.1 of the BIT in order to establish its jurisdiction to review the merits of the dispute. The interpretation made by an Arbitration Tribunal in one way or another on the possible extension of the MFN clause to jurisdictional issues can never by itself constitute a clear, obvious, and self-evident excess of powers.\n\n142.\n\nArgentina also claimed manifest excess of powers because the Tribunal, in its opinion, did not apply the applicable law (paragraph 33 above). In making this claim, Argentina referred to paragraphs 94 and 108 of the Award.\n\n143.\n\nParagraph 94 of the Award states:\n\n\"In sum, Article 8(3) contains a jurisdictional requirement that has to be fulfilled before an ICSID tribunal can assert jurisdiction. This decision is in accordance with the decision in *Wintershall,* where it was found for a very similar clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT, that \" Article 10(2) contains a time-bound prior-recourse-to-local-courts-clause, which mandates (not only permits) litigation by the investor (for a definite period) in the domestic forum,\" before the right to ICSID can even materialize. Impregilo not having fulfilled this requirement, the Tribunal cannot find jurisdiction on the basis of Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\"\n\n144.\n\nParagraph 108 of the Award states:\n\n\"Nevertheless, the Arbitral Tribunal finds it unfortunate if the assessment of these issues would in each case be dependent on the personal opinions of individual arbitrators. The best way to avoid such a result is to make the determination on the basis of case law whenever a clear case law can be discerned. It is true that, as stated above, the jurisprudence regarding the application of MFN clauses to settlement of dispute provisions is not fully consistent. Nevertheless, in cases where the MFN clause has referred to \"all matters\" or \"any matter\" regulated in the BIT, there has been near-unanimity in finding that the clause covered the dispute settlement rules. On this basis, the majority of the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Impregilo is entitled to rely, in this respect, on the dispute settlement rules in the Argentina-US BIT and that the case cannot be dismissed for non-observance of the requirements in Articles 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\"\n\n145.\n\nArgentina's complaint is, then, that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by not complying with the provisions of Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n146.\n\nFor the reasons explained in paragraph 131 above, the ground for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention would be the lack of application of Article 8(3). In this case the Tribunal did not fail to apply Article 8(3). On the contrary, it examined said article in paragraphs 79 to 93 of the Award and concluded in paragraph 94 that it lacked jurisdiction based on that specific article. However, the Tribunal proceeded further with the analysis of other provisions of the treaty and, after analyzing and discussing the MFN clause contained in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, in paragraphs 95 to 108 of the Award, the majority of the Tribunal concluded that it could rely on the Argentina-US BIT to not require Impregilo to have recourse to Argentine courts before filing a request for arbitration.\n\n147.\n\nArgentina\u2019s plea actually does not refer to the lack of application of Article 8(3) of the BIT; it is rather an expression of disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and specifically with the conclusion reached by the Tribunal concerning the scope of Article 3(1) of the BIT. It is not the task of this Committee to review whether the interpretation of article 8(3) by the Tribunal is correct or not. Even if the standard of article 52 were to allow a Committee to consider that a gross error in the application of the law equals a lack of application of the proper law, the Committee finds no self-evident, clear, obvious or substantially serious failure to apply the proper law, nor an error in the application of the law that would allow annulment within the ambit of Article 52, as requested by Argentina.\n\n148.\n\nArgentina also claimed the failure to apply Article 4 of the BIT (paragraphs 67, 68, and 69 above).\n\n149.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal did not apply Article 4 of the BIT which refers to losses in case of war, states of emergency or other events, and the type of treatment that should be given to compensation as may be warranted under the circumstances. It stated that in the Award the Tribunal deprived Article 4 of any useful effect.127\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 120\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal stated, in paragraphs 340-343 of the Award, the reasons for its conclusions in relation to Article 4 of the BIT and cited in support of these conclusions, the analysis made by two Arbitral Tribunals that heard other cases against Argentina *(CMS* and *Suez),* of a rule that the Tribunal considered similar to Article 4 of the BIT.128 The interpretation of article 4 by the Tribunal and the scope of its application in the Award are grounded by reference to other awards. Moreover, the Tribunal explained why it considered that this rule should not apply to the case at hand. Argentina does not agree with the analysis nor the conclusion reached by the Tribunal. This is different from a failure to apply the law. It is incorrect, therefore, to say that the Tribunal did not apply the applicable law simply because one does not agree with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation. Obviously, the determination of whether the interpretation of Article 4 of the BIT by the Tribunal is correct or not is a matter unrelated to this Committee and to any annulment proceeding.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 341 and 342\n\n151.\n\nArgentina also claimed that there was a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal which occurred in other ways: by exercising jurisdiction over Impregilo\u2019s claims for compensation based on a contract that said company did not sign (paragraphs 40, 41, and 43 above) and basing its decision on case law, which is not mandatory nor a source for the creation of law (paragraph 28).\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal stated in the Award that Impregilo formed a consortium with other companies, which were awarded one of the concession areas for the provision of drinking water services in the Province of Buenos Aires. In accordance with the bidding requirements, that consortium formed an Argentine company, AGBA.129 The Tribunal added that Argentina itself admitted the existence of a substantial case-law showing that claims such as those presented by Impregilo enjoy protection by ICSID under the applicable BITs, and found no reason to depart from that case-law.130 The Tribunal also said that Impregilo owns 42.58 percent of the shares of AGBA and made an equity investment of US$21.3 million in the company.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 14 and 137\n\nAward, \u00b6 140\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded in the Award, after mentioning another similar case, that \"... AGBA does not qualify as a protected investor under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and its contractual rights cannot be considered protected investments. On the other hand, Impregilo\u2019s shares in AGBA were an investment protected under the BIT.\"131 Argentina argued in its Memorial on Annulment, and was quoted in paragraph 42 above, that the Tribunal was wrong to allow Impregilo to take the place of AGBA in order to obtain compensation.\n\nAward, \u00b6 245\n\n154.\n\nEven though Argentina claims that Impregilo was authorized by the Tribunal to \"take the place\" of AGBA, to claim compensation, the issue that was decided by the Tribunal was whether Impregilo, as one of AGBA\u2019s shareholders, could file an independent claim for acts that affect AGBA, the local company. This is a topic that was debated extensively by Argentina and is a matter of interpretation of the BIT and its standards. This Committee may not analyze such interpretation and decide otherwise because it cannot review the merits of the Award. The characterization of the debate related to independent claims of shareholders as a situation where one company has \"taken the place\" of another would not change the aforesaid conclusion.\n\n155.\n\nMoreover, Argentina did not identify specifically what facts or matters the Tribunal failed to take into account in its analysis. If the Award needed to be supplemented or rectified, Argentina could have requested so, pursuant to Article 49 (2) of the Convention but, certainly, this is not a ground for annulment. Furthermore, the Tribunal considered that the shareholder had an independent claim for acts that affect the local company, which is a matter of interpretation of the TBI and of its standards that the Committee may not review as it would be imply a decision on the merits.\n\n156.\n\nRegarding the Tribunal\u2019s use of case law as the basis of the Award, the Committee is of the opinion that it is not possible to annul an award alleging manifest excess of powers because the Arbitral Tribunal based the award on other arbitration decisions. A tribunal is entitled to and often quotes from other decisions in deriving or in support of its own reasoning and quoting from rulings of other arbitral tribunals certainly constitutes a valid form of reasoning.\n\n157.\n\nAnother claim of Argentina founded on the alleged manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal is set forth in paragraph 53 above in which it is stated that Argentina accused the Tribunal that it deliberately \"failed to establish the criterion applied [in relation to fair and equitable treatment] in eventually holding Argentina liable for the violation of the alleged legitimate expectations.\" Before making such a claim Argentina had stated the following:\n\n\"The Tribunal itself acknowledged that \u2018[t]he term \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 appears in many BITs. It cannot be easily defined, and it is generally believed to require at least respect for the international minimum standard of protection which, according to international customary law, any State is obliged to afford to foreign property in its territory. The Tribunal considers that the term \u2018fair and equitable treatment,\u2019 as it appears in the present BIT and in other similar BITs, is intended to give adequate protection to the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations,\u2019 yet it only referred to general terms\u2014 without providing any supporting argument\u2014and did not specifically state on which grounds Argentina was found to be liable.\"132\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 89\n\n158.\n\nIn this Committee\u2019s opinion, the failure to fully conceptualize the content of a standard is not a ground for annulment of an award. In this case, the Tribunal gave reasons for its interpretation of the scope of the standard but even the failure to give reasons for its reasoning would not be a ground for annulment. Importantly, Argentina contradicted itself because it stated that the Tribunal did not explain the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard and later affirmed what was quoted in the previous paragraph, from which it may easily be deducted that the Tribunal did analyze the standard in question. In any case, it is obvious that the annulment mechanism is not devised to address the alleged omissions.\n\n159.\n\nFinally, Argentina alleged manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal when it fixed the compensation granted to Impregilo in the Award, which in its opinion is contrary to applicable law and, therefore, it stated that the Tribunal became liable for that ground of annulment (paragraph 78 above). As explained in that paragraph, Argentina argued that the Tribunal placed Impregilo in a better position than it would have been in if Argentina had not taken any action.\n\n160.\n\nThe Committee cannot review *de novo* the facts, evidence and criteria used by the Tribunal in assessing the damages nor the amount of compensation awarded to Impregilo. It is clear that Argentina disagrees with the causal connection found by the Tribunal between the damages and the disputed measures; that it considers that there was a gap in the analysis of causation and that the evidence produced should have resulted in a different compensation; and that it disagrees with the interpretation by the Tribunal of the applicable law in the assessment of the damages. However, a disagreement with the analysis of the Tribunal as to causation, or with respect to the assessment of the evidence or the interpretation of the law does not constitute ground for annulment under Article 52. None of the criticism that Argentina raises in connection with the Tribunal\u2019s analysis on compensation resulted in an excess of powers for the Tribunal not having applied the proper law. Of course, the assessment of damages cannot be arbitrary, but a Tribunal\u2019s determination of the amount of compensation allows for a high level of discretion and a disagreement with the criteria used by the Tribunal cannot be a ground for annulment of an award.\n\n161.\n\nIn conclusion, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the Committee considers that none of the five \"grounds\" for requesting annulment submitted by Argentina in relation to the Tribunal\u2019s alleged manifest excess of powers constitutes grounds for annulment. For that reason, Argentina\u2019s application for annulment of the Award, based on Article 52(1) (b) of the ICSID Convention will be rejected.\n\n162.\n\nThe Committee then discussed the second ground for annulment alleged by Argentina in this proceeding: serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure pursuant to Article 52(1) (d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**2. Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe ground cited in Article 52 (1) (d) has an important connotation: the word \"serious\" means that not any departure from a rule of procedure can lead to the annulment of an award; it must be \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\". Further the violation has to be akin to a \"fundamental\" rule of procedure.\n\n164.\n\nThis Committee agrees with the determinations made by other committees as regards the requirement that the departure has to have a material impact on the outcome of the award for the annulment to succeed.133 In the opinion of the Committee, the word \"serious\" expresses that impact.\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, 10 August 2012, \u00b6 101\n\n165.\n\nWith a view to defining the scope of this ground for annulment, other Committees have identified the following \"fundamental rules of procedure\": the equal treatment of the parties, the right to be heard, an independent and impartial tribunal, the treatment of evidence and burden of proof, and deliberations among members of the Tribunal.134 This Committee agrees with such formulations of the fundamental rules of procedure.\n\nId., \u00b6 100\n\n166.\n\nThe arguments put forward by Argentina with regard to this alleged breach committed by the Tribunal in the Award will be analyzed in the following paragraphs.\n\n167.\n\nIn paragraph 17 above the Committee noted that Argentina alleged a serious departure from a rule of procedure because the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction without the condition for consent having been met (Article 8(3) of the BIT). In this argument on grounds for annulment, which is being analyzed in this section, Argentina failed to indicate which fundamental rules of procedure the Tribunal had allegedly departed from or the manner in which said departure was made, when the Tribunal interpreted Article 8(3) of the BIT. The Committee is therefore unable to address this claim. Furthermore, in paragraphs 29 and 54 of its Reply, Argentina reiterated this argument with the same omissions.\n\n168.\n\nThe second argument supporting this ground for annulment relating to the issue of consent is set forth in paragraphs 35 and 36 above. Argentina claimed that the Tribunal failed to observe the consent of the parties to the BIT by not applying the condition of prior submission to local courts (Article 8(3) of that Treaty).\n\n169.\n\nThe Committee understands that, according to Argentina, the fundamental rule of procedure from which the Tribunal allegedly departed from was consent. The Committee carefully reviewed the part of the Award that makes reference to this issue and determined that there had been no such departure, as the Tribunal analyzed Articles 8(3) and 3(1) of the BIT and deduced that in this specific case Impregilo could benefit from the provisions of the Argentina-USA Treaty, where referral to local courts prior to submission to ICSID arbitration is not required.\n\n170.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal reviewed Article 8(3) of the BIT, which requires the investor to first refer disputes to Argentine courts. It did indeed analyze that Article and examined the arguments put forward by the parties relating to this Article and Article 3(1) of the BIT. Argentina\u2019s claim is in fact a disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Articles 3(1) and 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n171.\n\nAs has repeatedly been stated in the previous paragraphs, the fact that a Tribunal interprets the jurisdictional consequences of the MFN clause in one sense or another (i.e., as applying or not to jurisdictional matters) cannot be a ground for annulment on the basis that the given interpretation constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n172.\n\nThe third argument put forward by Argentina as a ground for serious departure from a rule of procedure was summarized in paragraphs 79, 80, 81, and 82 above. In these paragraphs, Argentina argues that the Tribunal awarded the compensatory damages claimed by Impregilo without considering the defenses raised by Argentina.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal reviewed the matter of the compensation awarded to Impregilo in paragraphs 361 through 381 of the Award. In these paragraphs, the Tribunal mentioned the difficulties obtaining financing that AGBA experienced, noted that the Argentine authorities had adopted an ambiguous position on this situation, and examined the effects of the measures adopted by Argentina in 2002. In paragraph 371 the Tribunal also stated that it could not be established with certainty in what situation Impregilo would have been had Argentina not breached the fair and equitable treatment standard. Based on that analysis, the Tribunal determined that reasonable probabilities and estimates were a sufficient basis for Impregilo\u2019s claims for compensation.\n\n174.\n\nIn paragraph 372 of the Award the Tribunal referred to the expert reports submitted by both parties. With regard to those submitted by Argentina it noted that \"in the latter reports, MM. Dapena and Coloma [who were questioned by the Parties and by the Tribunal] argue that the concession had no economic value and that no compensation can therefore be justified.\" The Tribunal then summarized the testimony of the experts presented by Impregilo. This Committee believes that it would have been appropriate that the Tribunal had provided a more thorough explanation of the reasons why it determined that the opinions of the experts for Argentina were not credible. However, that omission cannot, in any way, be a ground for annulment of the Award. In order to reinforce that conclusion, the Committee herein reiterates what it stated in paragraph 158 above.\n\n175.\n\nIf the Tribunal had not considered the defenses raised by Argentina in relation to this matter in the Award, no reference to the reports from the experts presented by Argentina would have been made. It is clear that the Tribunal searched for a way to determine the amount in damages, for which, in accordance with the discretionary authority of Arbitral Tribunals, it used reasonable probabilities and estimates.\n\n176.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal evaluated the evidence submitted by both parties on the amount of compensation, and reviewed the conclusions presented therein. There is, therefore, no serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure as Argentina has had the opportunity to present its defenses and evidence on this matter and the Tribunal established the amount of compensation in a reasonable manner. There is no requirement whatsoever for arbitral tribunals to indicate in an award the reasons why some types of evidence are more credible than others. Discretionary authority that is reasonable and reasoned is the rule in this regard, and it is clearly not within the purview of Annulment Committees, which do not have direct and immediate access to the evidence submitted by both parties, to determine whether the determinations made in an award were correct. Attempting to do so would involve a subsequent assessment of the conclusions of arbitral tribunals, which would destroy the basic principles of the institution of arbitration and outside the power of *ad hoc* Committees.\n\n177.\n\nArgentina also pointed out in this part of its claim that a ground for annulment exists where there is a reversal of the burden of proof. It is not evident in the Award that there was such reversal that materially affected the outcome of the case. The Committee further points out that neither the Memorial on Annulment nor the Reply submitted by Argentina provided adequate substantiation or analysis for its position. With respect to this issue, Argentina expressed a purely theoretical opinion, making no reference to the specific case.\n\n178.\n\nFor the reasons outlined in the previous paragraphs, the Committee rejects Argentina\u2019s arguments for annulment, which were based on the alleged serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee will now address the third ground for annulment put forward by Argentina in this proceeding: the failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based, pursuant to Article 52 (1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**3. Failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nFor this requirement to be established, an *ad hoc* Committee should not be concerned with the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning but is confined to ascertaining whether the reasoning would allow an informed reader to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusions. The Committee fully agrees with the following paragraph in the Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID:\n\n*\"Ad hoc* Committees [Klocher, MINE, Viviendi I, Wena, CDC, MCI, Fraport, Vierira, and Transgabonais] have explained that the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion. The correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant.\"135\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, August 10, 2012, \u00b6 106\n\n181.\n\nArticle 52 (1) (e) does not allow a committee to assess the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasoning in the award or to inquire into the quality of the reasons.136 As indicated by the Committee in MINE \"... The requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that...\" \"... the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law\". If the reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal with respect to an award cannot be understood by the parties and an informed reader, the reasons and basis for the award cannot be considered to have been stated; the issue of whether or not the conclusions of the Arbitral Tribunal are satisfactory to the parties can never be used as a valid ground for annulment of an award.\n\nSee Schreurer, C et al The ICSID Convention, A Commentary (Cambridge University Press, 2009), 1011.\n\n182.\n\nArgentina stated that the Tribunal declared itself competent to hear the dispute between the parties, without the condition for consent established in the BIT having been satisfied and added that the Tribunal did not state the reasons on which the decision regarding its jurisdiction was reached (paragraph 17 above). This was again stated in the section entitled \"Failure to state reasons,\" where reference was made to Article 3(1) of the BIT (paragraphs 20 through 24).\n\n183.\n\nIn paragraphs 79 and 80 of the Award the Tribunal analyzed the content of Article 8 of the BIT and the connection between clauses (2) and (3) of said Article. The Committee will summarize the Tribunal\u2019s findings in this regard as follows: in paragraph 82 it noted the possible interpretations of those clauses and in paragraphs 86 through 90 it analyzed the context in order to reach the conclusion outlined in paragraphs 90 and 91 that Impregilo did not comply with the conditions set forth in that rule. It also made reference in paragraphs 92 and 93 to what other Arbitral Tribunals (such as *Maffezini* and *Wintershall)* had decided with respect to jurisdictional requirements and in paragraph 94 of the Award it established a parallel between that latter case and this current one.\n\n184.\n\nIn subsequent paragraphs of the Award (95 through 109), the Tribunal analyzed the MFN clause. Paragraph 97 mentions the four arguments invoked by Argentina to oppose the application of the most favored nation clause in this case. In paragraph 99 the Tribunal explained its interpretation of the term \"treatment\" and of the phrase \"all other matters regulated by this Agreement,\" both of which appear in Article 3(1) of the BIT, and explained why it did not consider the allegations made by Argentina in its first argument in which it rejected the application of the MFN clause to jurisdictional issues.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal was of the opinion that in this case the Argentina-US BIT could be applied, pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, and determined that, on the basis of that application, the failure to meet the requirement established in Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT had no bearing on Impregilo\u2019s claim. Argentina did not agree with that reasoning and has expressed its disagreement repeatedly. In the opinion of the Committee, it is evident that disagreement of the reasoning cannot constitute a valid ground for its application for an annulment for lack of reasons.\n\n186.\n\nAs indicated in paragraph 25 above, Argentina stated that the conclusion expressed in paragraph 101 of the Award fails to set out the reasons therefor. This paragraph relates to the third argument presented by Argentina during the arbitral proceedings, against ascribing jurisdictional effects to the most favored nation clause. The Tribunal explained its conclusion noting that a system that provides the option of having recourse to domestic courts and to arbitration is more favorable than a system that does not offer this choice. Argentina does not agree with that conclusion. In the opinion of the Committee the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion and Argentina\u2019s opposing view on this issue is a matter that has no bearing whatsoever on this Application for Annulment.\n\n187.\n\nArgentina also argued that paragraph 102 of the Award did not state the reasons on which it was based (paragraph 26 above). Argentina (in paragraph 38 of its Memorial on Annulment) and Impregilo (in paragraphs 86 and 95 of its Counter-Memorial) discussed the dates on which the Argentina-Italy BIT and the Argentina-US BIT were signed and came into effect. Obviously, this discussion relates to the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and not to the absence of reasoning or grounds, and as such is of no relevance to this annulment proceeding.\n\n188.\n\nArgentina also indicated that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion in paragraph 108 of the Award cannot be considered to be a valid ground, as the Tribunal did not even indicate whether it agreed with the reasoning of other decisions rendered by Arbitral Tribunals that it cited (paragraph 27 above).\n\n189.\n\nFor purposes of continuing the analysis of Argentina\u2019s line of argument, the Committee once again quoted a part of said argument in relation to paragraph 108 of the Award:\n\n\"Notwithstanding the fact that the conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal with regard to the \"near-unanimity\" of the decisions on this matter is erroneous, the principle of *stare decisis* does not apply in the context of international arbitration. Therefore, the fact that this position was adopted by an alleged majority of the tribunals cannot be considered a valid reason for this decision.\"137\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 38 and 39\n\n190.\n\nThe Committee points out that, contrary to the assertion made by Argentina, the Tribunal did not assume that it was bound by decisions rendered by other Arbitral Tribunals nor the preponderance of decisions in a particular way. The Committee considers that the Tribunal believed that the decided cases and the \"near unanimity\" that it cited allowed it to reinforce its reasoning and findings, arrive at a conclusion and settle the dispute in the manner in which it did. This line of argument of Argentina is not a ground for annulment. While decisions rendered by Arbitral Tribunals are not binding, the reasoning contained therein can indeed be used by a Tribunal as a basis for its decision.\n\n191.\n\nIt should be made clear as well that no annulment committee can determine whether or not an arbitral tribunal used a \"valid reason\" to arrive at a specific conclusion. While the reasons for awards must be stated, the reasoning used by the arbitrators as grounds for the awards cannot and should not be subject to substantive and critical analysis by annulment committees.\n\n192.\n\nAs indicated in paragraph 39 above, Argentina also stated that the Tribunal failed to consider the arguments Argentina laid out with respect to the \"material competence\" of the Tribunal in its Memorial on Jurisdiction and at the hearing held from May 4-6, 2009. \"The Tribunal failed to consider fundamental arguments which were presented on those occasions and which are therefore fully incorporated herein [Memorial on Annulment] by reference.\"138 Moreover, it stated that the Tribunal, without conducting any analysis, accepted that the shares held by Impregilo in AGBA are protected investments under the BIT and that the violation of AGBA\u2019s rights must be considered to be a violation of Impregilo\u2019s rights; it therefore rejected, without stating the reasons, the objection raised by Argentina with regard to the material competence of the Tribunal.\n\nId., \u00b655\n\n193.\n\nArgentina specifically argued that, with regard to the issue of material competence, the Tribunal failed to consider the fundamental arguments that it presented in its Memorial on Jurisdiction; hence, it requested that these arguments be reproduced in its Application for Annulment. The Committee notes that Argentina did not indicate which of its arguments on jurisdiction it deemed to be fundamental and that, in its view, had not been analyzed by the Tribunal. On the issue of \"reproduction\" of the arguments presented by Argentina, the Committee reiterates the fact that it is not an appeal court and that its role is not to review Argentina\u2019s arguments on jurisdiction, but instead to render a decision on the alleged invalidity of the Award.\n\n194.\n\nWith regard to the determination of the Tribunal that the shares held by Impregilo in AGBA are protected investments under the BIT, the Committee points out that the Tribunal based its decision on Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT quoted below.\n\n\"ARTICLE 1 Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n1. \"Investment\" means, in accordance with the host country laws and irrespective of the selected legal form or any other related laws, any kind of asset invested or reinvested by an individual or a legal entity of a Contracting Party in the territory of the other Party, in conformity with the laws and regulations of the latter.\n\nWithin this general framework, it included, in particular though not exclusively:\n\n\u2026\n\nb) shares of stock, interests or any other form of participation, including minority or indirect interest, in a company established in the territory of each Contracting Party;...\"\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal based its decision on its interpretation of the BIT and its understanding of what the BIT defines as an investment. The Committee cannot review the accuracy of such interpretation and therefore finds no grounds here to support the application for the annulment of the Award.\n\n196.\n\nAnother claim included by Argentina in the section entitled \"failure to state reasons\" was described in paragraphs 45 through 47 above, in which Argentina stated that the Tribunal failed to specify how Impregilo could assert rights relating to the Concession Contract; in the Memorial on Annulment, it cited paragraphs 138, 245, 325, and 331 of the Award that address this claim.\n\n197.\n\nAlthough Argentina named this specific claim as a \"failure to state reasons,\" it is actually contending that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is contradictory (\"[t]he contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is manifest\")139 and that such alleged contradiction is so evident that it could be assimilated to lack of reasoning. The Committee disagrees. The fact that Argentina does not agree with the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, which is the case here, is no failure to state reasons and this ground should therefore be dismissed.\n\nId., \u00b6 74\n\n198.\n\nAs indicated in paragraph 47 above, Argentina criticized the fact that the Tribunal made reference to an award handed down by another arbitral tribunal and insisted that this other award could not serve as a basis for the Award. Argentina claims that the foregoing constitutes a \"manifest failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n199.\n\nThe Committee noted that in paragraphs 137 through 140 of the Award, the Tribunal stated its opinion on the second objection to jurisdiction raised by Argentina. Furthermore, in paragraph 140, it stated, as Argentina itself noted, that there is substantial case law showing that claims such as those filed by Impregilo enjoy protection under the BITs.\n\n200.\n\nAs noted by Argentina, arbitration case law is not binding on any Arbitral Tribunal. However, that fact does not mean that a tribunal cannot base its opinion on decisions rendered by other tribunals or uphold the decisions of other tribunals on a specific matter. The Tribunal summarized Argentina\u2019s position on the second objection that it raised, referring in that summary to *CMS v. Argentina.* It noted that the same approach had been adopted for other awards \"allowing shareholders to bring indirect claims in respect of the reduction in the value of their shares.\"140\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 114 and 127\n\n201.\n\nIf the Tribunal concluded that other Tribunals have accepted indirect claims and that it found no reason to depart from that case law, this is, in the Committee\u2019s opinion, a valid reason on which to base its decision. Argentina agreed with this opinion but argued that the reference to decided cases is not a valid way to state reasons for an award. Yet, it did not explain why this is the case; why an Arbitral Tribunal cannot state the reason for its decision, indicating that other cases have been decided in a particular manner and that with respect to the case that it is considering it can find no reason to depart from that decision. Stating that it has no ground to disagree with decisions in another case means that the Tribunal accepted the reasoning in those decisions and applied that to the specific case submitted to it. Based on the foregoing, the Committee finds that Argentina\u2019s assertion of a failure to state reasons is without merit.\n\n202.\n\nArgentina put forward another argument on the alleged failure to state reasons in paragraph 114 of its Reply (referred to in paragraph 66 above). The issue in question is the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Article 4 of the BIT and the emergency measures adopted by Argentina during the economic crisis in which it was mired. In sum, Argentina stated that the Tribunal handed down an award for which it failed to state the reasons and held it liable for the emergency measures that it had adopted.\n\n203.\n\nIn paragraphs 336 through 360 of the Award, the Tribunal examined Argentina\u2019s state of necessity plea. In these paragraphs, the Tribunal analyzed Article 4 of the BIT in light of customary international law and considered the provisions of Article 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations. It also examined the conclusions of the *CMS* and *Suez* Arbitral Tribunals; it made reference to facts on the Argentine crisis which are of public knowledge; it reviewed reports on Argentina\u2019s economic situation (paragraph 350 of the Award), and considered Argentina\u2019s contribution to the crisis. In short, the Tribunal based its decision on several solid sources; it is therefore not correct that it failed to state the reasons for its conclusions on this matter.\n\n204.\n\nArgentina argued in paragraph 70 above that the majority of the Tribunal relied mainly on the report from Impregilo\u2019s expert without establishing the legal criteria in arriving at its conclusions, and, consequently, failed to state the reasons (paragraph 73 above).\n\n205.\n\nAs mentioned in paragraphs 71 and 72 above, Argentina disagrees with the conclusions of the Tribunal on this matter, because it does not agree with the testimony of Impregilo\u2019s expert at the arbitration proceedings. A disagreement with the decision of the Tribunal clearly falls outside the competence of this Committee.\n\n206.\n\nOn this same point Argentina asserted the following:\n\n\"The Tribunal also failed to consider Edwards\u2019 contradictions during his examination at the merits phase, which is an additional ground for annulment of the Award, as it seriously departed from a rule of procedure. Indeed, at the hearing, the expert contradicted himself and his prior submissions or statements regarding the Argentine crisis and the measures under analysis. Furthermore, Edwards\u2019 *lack of reliability* became evident, as he attached to his report the documents or instruments on which he relied in preparing his opinion, excluding such pages or parts as supported Argentina\u2019s position. This is clear evidence of the fact that Edwards was far from being an independent expert. Therefore, the Tribunal should not have relied on his report to hold Argentina liable.\"141\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 139\n\n207.\n\nIt is evident that, based on the argument of an alleged failure to state the reasons for this part of the Award, Argentina is expecting the Committee to assess the credibility that the testimony of Mr. Edwards, Impregilo\u2019s expert, should have had for the Tribunal, which was the responsibility of the Tribunal, and which is clearly impossible under the standards of Article 52. The credibility of an expert is not a matter for review in an annulment proceeding.\n\n208.\n\nFinally, in the section entitled \"Compensation\" (paragraphs 75 and 76 above) Argentina argued that there was a failure to state reasons.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal analyzed the issue of compensation in paragraphs 361 through 384 of the Award. At the arbitral proceedings, Impregilo requested payment for all losses suffered plus compound interest. The Tribunal noted that Impregilo had the burden of proof, but that the circumstances of the case made it difficult to assess damages. As a result, the Tribunal pointed out that \"...probabilities and estimates have to suffice...\"142 The Tribunal also noted that it had serious doubts about the forecasts made by AGBA in its Business Plan143 and added that AGBA only made a minor part of the envisaged investments and that it could not establish that the concession would have been profitable.144 The Tribunal explained further down that the compensation amount would be based solely on the capital contribution made by AGBA shareholders and indicated the evidence used to determine that amount (MM. Walck\u2019s and Giacchino\u2019s reports).145\n\nAward, \u00b6 371\n\nId., \u00b6 373\n\nAward, \u00b6 375\n\nId., \u00b6 381\n\n210.\n\nIn light of the foregoing paragraph, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal provided detailed information and analysis on the evidence that it considered and clearly outlined how it arrived at its ruling against Argentina. Evidently, this Committee does not have authority nor is it empowered (among other reasons, because it did not have direct access to the evidence submitted by the parties) to ascertain whether or not the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions were correct.\n\n211.\n\nBased on the reasons set forth in the foregoing paragraphs, the Committee will reject the arguments for annulment put forward by Argentina which are based on the alleged failure to state the reasons for the Award.\n\n212.\n\nIn the following section the Committee will refer to other arguments raised by Argentina in its Memorial on Annulment and its Reply to request annulment of the Award.\n\n**4. Other arguments for annulment**\n------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nArgentina presented other arguments to request annulment of the Award:\n\na. \"Contradictions,\" \"inconsistencies,\" and \"unreasonable statements,\" in the Award (paragraphs 45, 55, 61,62, 63, 64, 69 of this Decision).\n\nb. Risk of \"double recovery\" (paragraphs 48 y 49 above).\n\nc. Derivative or indirect actions are not provided for under Argentine law (paragraph 50).\n\nd. Indirect actions are not provided for under international law (paragraphs 51 and 52 above).\n\ne. \"The Tribunal abrogated the normative content of the standard requiring the investment be accorded fair and equitable treatment, by failing to clarify its meaning\" (paragraphs 53 through 63).\n\n214.\n\nWith respect to the alleged \"contradictions,\" \"inconsistencies,\" and \"unreasonable statements\" in the Award the Committee points out once again that Articles 49 and 50 of the ICSID Convention provide parties with the opportunity to request that the Tribunal address omissions, rectify material errors, and clarify the interpretation of an award. Argentina could make use of those mechanisms if, in fact, there were grounds to do so. Obviously, they cannot be heard by this Committee because pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention they are not grounds for annulment.\n\n215.\n\nThe Committee is also unable to make reference to the remaining arguments supporting the application for annulment set forth in paragraph 211(b) through (e) above, as none of them constitutes grounds for annulment, pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n216.\n\nFor the above reasons the Committee will dismiss completely Argentina\u2019s application for annulment of the Award.\n\n217.\n\nThe Committee will decide on the payment of costs of this annulment proceeding and render its final decision in the following section.\n\n**D. COSTS**\n------------\n\n218.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of the Convention (Articles 59 through 61) shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to the proceedings before this Committee.\n\n219.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention states:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\"\n\n220.\n\nAs reflected In paragraph 4 of the April 23, 2012 minutes of the First Session, the Parties did not agree on a method for apportionment of costs different from that envisaged in Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n221.\n\nAlthough the Argentine Republic\u2019s Application is being rejected in its entirety, the Committee does not consider the Application frivolous. Accordingly, exercising its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee decides the following: (a) the Applicant shall bear the costs of the proceeding, comprising all of the fees and expenses of the Committee Members, and the costs of using the ICSID facilities; and (b) each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\n**E. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n222.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee unanimously decides:\n\ni. To dismiss in its entirety the Application for Annulment of the Award submitted by the Argentine Republic.\n\nii. To declare the stay of enforcement automatically terminated, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3).\n\niii. That each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\niv. That the Applicant Argentine Republic shall bear the costs of the proceeding, comprising the fees and expenses of the Committee Members, and the costs of using the ICSID facilities."}]}
