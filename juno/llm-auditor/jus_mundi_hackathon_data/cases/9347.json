Overview of the arbitration**\n----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of the Republic of Panama on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**BIT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThis dispute relates to the Republic of Panama's alleged breach of the BIT by purportedly (1) expropriating Campos de Pes\u00e9's investment (in violation of Article V), (2) failing to accord Campos de Pes\u00e9 fair and equitable treatment (in violation of Article II(3)), (3) interfering with the use and enjoyment of its investment (in violation of Article II(3)), (4) discriminating against Campos de Pes\u00e9 (in violation of Article III(1)), and (5) failing to accord Campos de Pes\u00e9 full legal protection of its investment (in violation of Article III(1)).\n\n**B. Parties**\n--------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant is Campos de Pes\u00e9, S.A. (\"**Claimant**\" or \"**Campos de Pes\u00e9**\"), a company incorporated in and governed by the laws of the Republic of Panama.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Panama (\"**Respondent**\" or \"**Panama**\").\n\n5.\n\nClaimant and Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page ii.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 4 May 2020, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Campos de Pes\u00e9 against Panama (the \"**Request**\"). The Request invoked Panama's advance consent to ICSID arbitration given in the BIT.\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 June 2020, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 7, invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n8.\n\nOn 3 August 2020, the Parties agreed, in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, that the Tribunal in this case would comprise three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the third arbitrator, presiding, to be appointed by the two Party-appointed arbitrators.\n\n9.\n\nOn 17 September 2020, in accordance with the Parties' agreement and pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 5(2), the Centre proceeded to seek the acceptance of the Parties' appointees: Mr. Horacio Grigera-Na\u00f3n, a national of Argentina, appointed by Claimant and Prof. Brigitte Stern, a French national, appointed by Respondent. Prof. Stern and Mr. Grigera-Na\u00f3n accepted their appointments on 26 and 27 September 2020, respectively.\n\n10.\n\nOn 10 October 2022, Prof. Stern and Mr. Grigera-Na\u00f3n informed the Centre that they had agreed on the appointment of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta Jaramillo, a national of Colombia, as the third, presiding arbitrator. On the same date, the Centre informed the Parties of Mr. Zuleta's appointment.\n\n11.\n\nOn 14 October 2020, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, ICSID Deputy Secretary-General, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 15 December 2020, by video conference.\n\n13.\n\nOn 16 December 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Annex C of Procedural Order No. 1 set out an agreed schedule for the proceeding.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, on 5 May 2021, Claimant filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits (the \"**Memorial**\"). The pleading was accompanied by two expert reports and six witness statements.\n\n15.\n\nOn 14 June 2021, Respondent filed a request to address the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question (\"**Request for Bifurcation**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn 23 July 2021, Claimant filed a response to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation.\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 August 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, deciding to hear Respondent's jurisdictional objection *ratione personae* in a preliminary phase, and, accordingly, to follow the procedural calendar set forth in Annex C, Scenario 2, Option II(2) of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n18.\n\nOn 24 November 2021, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nOn 22 February 2022, Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied by three expert opinions.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing document production requests from both Parties, on 12 April 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, ordering the Parties to produce certain documents.\n\n21.\n\nOn 12 July 2022, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to suspend the procedural calendar to allow Claimant to determine the additional time needed to complete an agreed-upon supplemental document production.\n\n22.\n\nOn 2 November 2022, the Parties provided the Tribunal with their agreed schedule for the second round of submissions.\n\n23.\n\nOn 27 January 2023, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction. The pleading was accompanied by one expert report and four legal opinions.\n\n24.\n\nOn 28 April 2023, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction. The pleading was accompanied by four expert opinions and three witness statements.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 9, 2023, Respondent requested that the Tribunal refrain from considering eleven exhibits filed by Claimant with its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"**Respondent\u2019s Application**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 11 May 2023, Respondent notified Claimant that it wished to cross-examine the following witnesses and experts at the Hearing: (i) Mr. Carlos Pellas; (ii) Mr. Ernesto Palazio; (iii) Mr. Henry Mander; (iv) Mr. Mark Olson; and (v) Mr. Jaime Mora. By correspondence of the same day, Claimant designated the following expert witnesses for cross-examination at the Hearing: (i) Mr. Luis Chalhoub; (ii) Mr. Todd Flubacher; (iii) Mr. Mark J. Forte; (iv) Mr. Robert Lindley; and (v) Ms. Isabel Kunsman.\n\n27.\n\nOn 15 May 2023, Claimant replied to Respondent's Application.\n\n28.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's invitation, on 19 May 2023, Respondent filed its reply to Claimant's letter of 15 May 2023, and, on 22 May 2023, Claimant filed its rejoinder regarding Respondent's Application.\n\n29.\n\nOn 19 May 2023, the Parties also provided a statement outlining their joint proposals for the Hearing and their respective positions on issues where no agreement was reached.\n\n30.\n\nOn 26 May 2023, a pre-hearing organizational meeting (\"**PHOM**\") was held between the Parties and the President of the Tribunal *via* video conference. During the PHOM, the Parties discussed outstanding procedural, administrative, and logistical matters in preparation for the Hearing, including Respondent's Application.\n\n31.\n\nOn 28 May 2023, the Secretary of the Tribunal sent an email to the Parties documenting the agreements reached at the PHOM and the subsequent directions from the Tribunal. In particular, the Secretary manifested that no ruling of the Tribunal was necessary concerning the format of attendance of Mr. Ernesto Palazio as Claimant had confirmed he would be attending in person.\n\n32.\n\nOn 1 June 2023, Claimant filed an application to close the Hearing to the public (\"**Claimant\u2019s First Application**\") indicating, *inter alia,* that the proposal made during the PHOM was no longer acceptable and that Messrs. Pellas and Palazio would appear at the Hearing in Washington, D.C., only if the Hearing was closed to the public and not recorded. Respondent submitted its opposition to Claimant's First Application on 5 June 2023.\n\n33.\n\nOn 2 June 2023, Respondent communicated its understanding of the Parties' agreement concerning Respondent's Application. On the same date, Claimant confirmed its agreement with Respondent's communication, subject to certain clarifications.\n\n34.\n\nOn 7 June 2023, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to deny Claimant's First Application considering that it found no evidence that the situation between the PHOM and the date of the Application had changed and, therefore, there was no reason to depart from the manner of proceeding agreed on 26 May 2023.\n\n35.\n\nOn 12 June 2023, Claimant filed an application requesting leave for Mr. Pellas to testify virtually and that the Hearing be entirely closed to the public during his testimony. Claimant also indicated that Mr. Palazio would only testify at the Hearing under the same conditions as Mr. Pellas (the \"**Claimant\u2019s Second Application**\"). Respondent objected to Claimant's Second Application on 13 June 2023.\n\n36.\n\nOn 14 June 2023, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to reject Claimant's Second Application, as it was untimely and unjustified. Considering, however, that the testimony could involve confidential matters, the Tribunal ordered that Messrs. Pellas and Palazio testify in person at the Hearing in Washington, D.C., in a closed session without any video recording, and that the attendance be limited to the Tribunal and its Secretary, the Assistant to the President of the Tribunal, the Parties' Counsel and Representatives, court reporters, designated interpreters (if required), and ICSID's technical team.\n\n37.\n\nOn 15 June 2023, Claimant informed the Tribunal that Messrs. Pellas and Palazio would not be attending the Hearing.\n\n38.\n\nOn 16 June 2023, the Tribunal invited Respondent to provide comments on Claimant\u2019s notice by the next day. Additionally, both Parties were invited to provide then comments on the application of Section 18(6) of Procedural Order No. 1 to the witness statements of Messrs. Pellas and Palazio, during their opening statements at the Hearing.\n\n39.\n\nOn 17 June 2023, Respondent submitted comments on Messrs. Pellas\u2019 and Palazio\u2019s failure to appear at the Hearing and reserved its rights to address the consequences that this should entail dining its opening statement at the Hearing.\n\n40.\n\nOn 18 June 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, concerning the organization of the Hearing.\n\n41.\n\nThe Hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., from June 20 to 21 June 2023. The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n*Tribunal:*\n\nMr. Eduardo Zuleta Jaramillo President  \nMr. Horacio Grigera-Na\u00f3n Arbitrator  \nProf. Brigitte Stern Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat:*\n\nMr. Gonzalo Flores Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*For Claimant:*\n\nJames Boykin Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \nNicolas Swerdloff Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \nEleanor Emey Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \nShayda Vance Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \nAlexander Afnan Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \nSvitlana Stegniy Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \nJames Nance Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \n[REDACTED] [REDACTED]  \nAlex Miller Core Legal Concepts  \nRyan Knecht Core Legal Concepts  \nHenry Mander Harney Westwood & Riegels  \nMark D.

Pellas and Palazio.\n\n43.\n\nOn 8 September 2023, each Party filed a submission on costs.\n\n**III. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n44.\n\nIn its Memorial and Reply, Respondent requests the following relief:\n\n\"For the reasons set forth above, Respondent respectfully submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\"1\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"Respondent\u2019s Memorial\"), \u00b6 59; Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction (\"Respondent\u2019s Reply\"), \u00b6 125.\n\n**B. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n45.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, Claimant requests the following relief:\n\n\"For the foregoing reasons, Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent's objection and find that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Claimant's claims.\"2\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial\"), \u00b6 129; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder\"), \u00b6 249.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n46.\n\nParagraphs 47 to 71 below present the relevant facts alleged by Claimant solely for the purpose of establishing the context of the dispute. This summary does not imply any assessment of the truth or relevance of these facts regarding the case's merits. In analyzing Respondent's jurisdictional objection *ratione personae,* the Tribunal will consider the facts relevant for its jurisdiction.\n\n47.\n\nIn 2009, the shareholders of SER Holding Company Ltd (\"**SER**\"), a British Virgin Islands (\"**BVI**\") headquartered company, sought to expand their investment opportunities in the Republic of Panama, particularly in the alcohol and liquor business.3 For this purpose, SER acquired 50% of the issued shares of four Panamanian companies: (1) Campos de Pes\u00e9, focused then on agricultural operations; (2) Alcoholes del Istmo S.A., which sold alcohol locally; (3) Alcoholes del Istmo Internacional, S.A., which sold alcohol internationally; and (4) Consorcio Licorero Nacional, S.A., which sold liquors.4 As the holding company of the mentioned subsidiaries, SER created Alcoholes del Istmo Holding Company Inc. (\"**ADI Holding**\"). ADI Holding subsequently changed its name to Panama Sugar Estates (\"**PSE**\").5\n\nBarrios Witness Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez Witness Statement, \u00b6 20.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 113.\n\n48.\n\nIn 2009, Campos de Pes\u00e9 planted sugar cane and sold it to sugar mills that refined it. Then, the company bought the refined sugar back as the raw material required for the production and sale of alcohol.6\n\nGonz\u00e1lez Witness Statement, \u00b6 12.\n\n49.\n\nIn 2011, Panama enacted a series of laws and executive decrees related to the local production of bioethanol using local materials and labor in order to promote a local bioethanol industry.7 On 20 April 2011, Panama issued Law No. 42 \"Establishing Guidelines for the National Biofuel Policy and Electrical Energy from Biomass in the National Territory\" (\"**Law No. 42**\").8 Its purpose was to establish general guidelines of the national policy for the promotion, advancement and development of the production and use of biofuels.9 Law No. 42 declared the promotion of a domestic biofuel industry \"to be of national interest\", offering incentives to foreign investors in the field.10\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 3\n\n**CL-2-SPA**, Law No. 42 Establishing Guidelines for the National Biofuel Policy and Electrical Energy from Biomass in the National Territory.\n\n**CL-2-SPA**, Law No. 42 Establishing Guidelines for the National Biofuel Policy and Electrical Energy from Biomass in the National Territory, Article 1.\n\n**CL-2-SPA**, Law No. 42 Establishing Guidelines for the National Biofuel Policy and Electrical Energy from Biomass in the National Territory, Articles 12-13.\n\n50.\n\nOn 30 June 2011, SER's Board of Directors (the \"**SER Board**\") decided to change Campos de Pes\u00e9's business model considering that Law No. 42 created what they perceived as a stable market for the production and marketing of bioethanol.11 SER then proceeded to invest through PSE and its subsidiaries in a project for the production of bioethanol. The SER Board decided to capitalize PSE and to initiate the bioethanol project.12 SER also decided to appoint three Board members to carry out all necessary activities to assess the viability of the bioethanol project: Carlos Pellas, Ricardo Barrios, and [REDACTED].13\n\n**C-0003**, Minutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors, 30 June 2011.\n\n**C-0003**, Minutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors, 30 June 2011.\n\n**C-0003**, Minutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors, 30 June 2011.\n\n51.\n\nOn 21 September 2011, Campos de Pes\u00e9 implemented the first stage of the Environmental Impact Study required by the National Environment Authority. This stage focused on the use of the existing facilities at Campos de Pes\u00e9 and its affiliates.14\n\n**C-0018**, Administrative Process Against Campos de Pes\u00e9, S.A., for the Alleged Environmental Administrative Infringement, 21 July 2014, p. 20\n\n52.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, Campos de Pes\u00e9 obtained a ten-year renewable permit for the biofuel plant issued by the National Energy Secretariat to install and operate the facilities.15\n\n**C-0004-SPA**, Biofuels Plant Permit, 22 October 2012.\n\n53.\n\nAs of January 2013, all of the systems of the biofuel plant were fully constructed.16\n\nGonz\u00e1lez Statement, \u00b6 48.\n\n54.\n\nOn 14 May 2013, the Panamanian Government published Executive Order No. 345, requiring oil companies to mix gasoline with anhydrous bioethanol as an oxygenating additive. It also mandated anhydrous bioethanol to be blended with gasoline, with a minimum percentage of 5% and a maximum of 10%. While Law No. 42 called for the sale of blended gasoline by April 2013, the Government had to amend it17 to provide the 5% blending by September 2013. The percentage would increase respectively to 7% in 2015 and 10% in 2016.\n\n**CL-0093**, Law of Panama No. 21 Modifying Law No. 42, Regarding the Use of Anhydrous Bioethanol and Other Provisions, 26 March 2013.\n\n55.\n\nOn 22 June 2013, the bioethanol plant was ready for operations and produced bioethanol for the first time the next day.18 Campos de Pes\u00e9 started producing bioethanol at an actual cost of USD $1.17 per liter.

Burden and standard of proof\n-------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nBased on *Caratube*47 and *Soufraki*48, Respondent argues that Claimant has the burden of showing that the Tribunal has jurisdiction in the case at hand.49 Specifically, for purposes of the BIT, Claimant has the burden of showing that Italian nationals controlled and managed Campos de Pes\u00e9 as of August 2014, the date of the alleged breaches.50 Respondent alleges that Campos de Pes\u00e9 did not meet the burden of proof to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,51 as the 26 Individuals are not majority shareholders of SER nor do they hold control over it.52\n\n*Caratube International Oil Co., LLP v.

According to Respondent, Campos de Pes\u00e9 failed to prove that it was controlled and managed by Italian nationals at all relevant times.53\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 17.\n\n74.\n\nRespondent's objection is twofold. First, it claims that Claimant failed to prove that the 26 Individuals who claim to own the majority of SER \u2014 a BVI offshore company that indirectly holds a majority stake in Campos de Pes\u00e9 through the Panamanian company PSE \u2014 were Italian nationals at the relevant times.54\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 4, \u00b6 6.\n\n75.\n\nSecond, Respondent contends that Claimant did not prove that these 26 Individuals controlled and managed SER, PSE, or Campos de Pes\u00e9.55 Respondent argues that both control *and* management must be met for the Tribunal to find jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the BIT, as the Spanish version uses the term \"*controlada*\", and the Italian version uses the term \"*gestita*\", which translates to \"manage.\" Italy has not used interchangeably the terms \"control\" and \"manage\" in other investment treaties; in fact, there is no other investment treaty where Italy used the term *gestita.*56 Additionally, Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention also uses the term \"control.\"57\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 19; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 26.\n\n76.\n\nAccordingly, Respondent maintains that \"[t]he 26 alleged Italians are not SER shareholders and [Claimant] has failed to provide evidence demonstrating that they indirectly own the majority of SER, let alone of Campos de Pes\u00e9. The most significant of the 26 alleged Italian nationals [Mr. Carlos Pellas] purports to hold an interest in SER through complicated offshore structures that practically deprive [him] of ownership or control. And there is no evidence that the 26 alleged Italians ever participated in any way, shape or form in [Campos de Pes\u00e9]\u2019s investment or activities in Panam\u00e1.\"58 Respondent argues that Claimant \"rests its case on the sole basis that the alleged Italians supposedly are the final beneficiaries *(beneficiarios finales)* of [Campos de Pes\u00e9].\"59\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 28.\n\n*a. Relevant dates*\n-------------------\n\n77.\n\nPanama alleges that Campos de Pes\u00e9 was never owned or controlled by Italian nationals at the relevant times: (a) in June 2011, when Claimant initiated the alleged investment in Panama; (b) in August 2014, when the alleged breaches of the BIT took place, and (c) in May 2020, the date of consent to ICSID arbitration.60\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 3; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\n78.\n\nIn its Reply, Panama observes that Claimant accepts the relevant date for assessing jurisdiction: August 2014.61 It further claims that the Tribunal cannot find jurisdiction looking only at May 2020; it must necessarily find that Italians controlled and managed Campos de Pes\u00e9 as of August 2014.62\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 31.\n\n79.\n\nIn any event, Panama claims that at no point was Campos de Pes\u00e9 controlled or managed by Italian nationals, nor were the majority of the company's final beneficiaries Italian nationals.63\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 33.\n\n*b. Italian nationality*\n------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn its Memorial, Respondent argued that Claimant did not prove that all the 26 Individuals were Italian nationals at any relevant time for this dispute.64 According to Respondent, there is no evidence that they acquired the Italian nationality in compliance with Italian law.65\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 9, \u00b6 14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 15-18.\n\n81.\n\nRespondent further argued that even if the 26 Individuals were Italian nationals, they did not satisfy the dominant and effective nationality test.66 In this case, there is an \"absence of any credible link connecting to Italy the 26 Individuals who are each claiming shareholder and nationality status.\"67 Thus, accepting Campos de Pes\u00e9's claim would be an abuse of the system of international investment protection.68\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 21.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 32.\n\n82.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argued that most of the alleged 26 Individuals appear to be citizens of Nicaragua,69 and that Nicaraguan law prohibits Nicaraguan nationals from holding a second nationality absent any double nationality agreement with the other State, and there is no dual nationality agreement between Italy and Nicaragua.70\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 34; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 114(iv).\n\n83.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Pellas Group presents itself to the public as a Nicaraguan business group, and Claimant even recognizes that SER has always been owned by the Pellas family.71 Also, SER's primary company is Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited (\"**NSEL**\"), which has received financing from the International Finance Corporation as a Nicaraguan company.72 Moreover, in July 2014, Claimant applied to the benefits granted to foreign investors under Panamanian Law 24/1998, but it never argued that it was owned or controlled by Italian nationals. Before this arbitration, none of the 26 Individuals had ever presented themselves as Italian nationals, and Carlos Pellas had even claimed that he was either Nicaraguan or Spanish, not Italian, before the Panamanian National Securities Commission.73\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 30.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 30, Exhibit A, Exhibit B.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 33, Exhibit E, Exhibit G.\n\n84.\n\nIn its Reply, Respondent noted that Claimant misrepresented that the 26 Individuals -allegedly Italian nationals- were shareholders of SER. If Claimant had disclosed the structures through which these individuals purported to be the \"final beneficiaries\" of SER, and their ability to indirectly control SER as such, it would have been evident from the start that, regardless of these individuals' actual nationality, SER was never majority-owned by Italians at any relevant time.74\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34-43.\n\n85.\n\nNevertheless, Respondent also asserted in its Reply that \"[s]ignificant questions continue looming regarding the lack of Italian nationality of the group of 26 alleged Italian \"final beneficiaries\" and therefore \"reincorporate[d] its arguments in its Objections to Jurisdiction regarding the nationality.\"75\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 114, \u00b6 112.\n\n*c. Control over Campos de Pes\u00e9*\n--------------------------------\n\n(i) Definition of control\n-------------------------\n\n86.\n\nRelying on *Standard Chartered Bank*76 and *Guardian Fiduciary Trus*t77, Respondent asserts that the \"mere passive, indirect and removed shareholding in SER does not suffice\"78 for control to be asserted. On the contrary, under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, a claimant has the burden of providing the necessary information and evidence showing ownership and real or actual control at all relevant times.79 Citing *Caratube*80, Respondent also claims that tribunals have rejected the idea that legal capacity to control is enough, as Claimant asserts.81\n\n*Standard\u00a0Chartered Bank v.

Campos de Pes\u00e9 did not even produce the share certificates showing that the [REDACTED] own shares in SER.89\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 54.\n\n93.\n\nFurthermore, Campos de Pes\u00e9 misrepresented the ownership of [REDACTED] shareholder records indicate that in 2011 and 2014, the company was owned by [REDACTED] while Claimant has alleged that it was owned by [REDACTED] Shareholder information from [REDACTED] and shareholder information from SER do not match. In fact, Campos de Pes\u00e9 omitted [REDACTED] in its Request and its Counter-Memorial, and did not provide a power of attorney or consent given by [REDACTED] to the arbitration. The only document in the record is a passport expired in 2005 of [REDACTED]\" There is no evidence that [REDACTED] is [REDACTED]. Hence, Campos de Pes\u00e9 cannot claim that [REDACTED] is one of the 26 Individuals who are allegedly Italians and shareholders of SER.90\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 55.\n\n94.\n\nLastly, Campos de Pes\u00e9 cannot count [REDACTED] as a shareholder of SER at the relevant time, as she conceded in sworn declaration that she became a shareholder in 2018. Claimant provided a \"certificate\" issued by SER purporting to identify [REDACTED] as the owner of 1.2% of SER's shares as of August 2014.

And the fact that [REDACTED] is the [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] does not create an ownership interest by the [REDACTED] over property owned by [REDACTED]. Moreover, Mr. Pellas is not a [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED]. Therefore, even if the [REDACTED] could somehow be considered the direct shareholder of The [REDACTED] despite that the actual owner is [REDACTED] this has nothing to do with Mr. Pellas because he is not a [REDACTED] ofthe [REDACTED] and thus has no entitlement to assets owned directly or indirectly by the [REDACTED]\"98\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. \u00b6 67.\n\n99.\n\nFurthermore, being the [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] does not make Mr. Pellas the final [REDACTED] of [REDACTED].99 Respondent relies on Robert Lindley\u2019s expert opinion to support this position: \"[u]pon Pellas transferring his [REDACTED]he [REDACTED] himself from ownership, with the [REDACTED] ([REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] becoming the owner and ultimate decision maker in relation to such assets.\"100 This makes [REDACTED] the ultimate decision-making authority over the [REDACTED] not Mr. Pellas.101\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. \u00b6 68.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. \u00b6 69; Legal Opinion of Robert Lindley, \u00b6 3.11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. \u00b6 69.\n\n100.\n\nRespondent asserts that the fact that Mr. Pellas is a director of [REDACTED] does not make him the final [REDACTED] either. As expert Robert Lindley also explained, Mr. Pellas does not have sole control over the management of [REDACTED] Mr. Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz also serves in that role to the company, and the documents even identify him as \"special\" director.102\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. \u00b6 70.\n\n101.\n\nIn this regard, Panama alleges that these types of complex corporate structures are usually built to avoid tax payments.

From June 2014 to February 2021, Florential was owned by the [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] was owned by the [REDACTED]. Both [REDACTED] were established under Delaware law, under which, Ernesto Palazio is merely a [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] None of these roles entail ownership or grant Ernesto Palazio management power.106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. \u00b6 75.\n\n105.\n\nMoreover, he cannot be deemed as final beneficiary of SER through the alleged ownership of [REDACTED] as [REDACTED] internal shareholder records as of 2011, reveal that it was owned by [REDACTED], a non-Italian. Ernesto Palazio only became an owner of [REDACTED] in 2013, contrary to the conclusions drawn from SER\u2019s \"certificates\" of shareholders, which Panama believes to contain false information.107\n\nRespondent's Reply. \u00b6 78.\n\niv. [REDACTED]\n--------------\n\n106.\n\n[REDACTED] cannot be considered the final beneficiary of [REDACTED] since he was not the owner of [REDACTED] in 2011 or 2014, and he cannot rely on [REDACTED] \u2014whom Panama believes to be the real owner of the company\u2014 as the final beneficiary of the company in this stage of the proceedings, as Claimant has not provided any evidence to support this assertion. Hence, Campos de Pes\u00e9 waived any arguments regarding [REDACTED] by not even disclosing his existence and relying on improper documents on this matter.108\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n\n(iii) Whether SER\u2019s Board of Directors controlled Campos de Pes\u00e9\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nClaimant did not provide documentation proving the involvement of the 26 Individuals in PSE or the Board of Directors of Campos de Pes\u00e9, or as employees or executives for any of these corporations.109 In any event , the six alleged Italian individuals that were proven to have been directors of SER, owned only an average of 1.81% of SER\u2019s shares.110 Respondent reiterates that the fact that Italian individuals sit in the SER Board of Directors is not sufficient to establish jurisdiction, when said individuals do not directly hold a significant amount of shares in SER.111 Additionally, Campos de Pes\u00e9 only has had one Italian director, officer or employee: Mr. Carlos Pellas until 2011.112\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 47, \u00b6 49.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 43.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 104, \u00b6 109.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 111.\n\n**B.

Respondent\u2019s rebuttal of such *prima facie* evidence of nationality is subj ect to a high standard considering that it involves disregarding the national authority\u2019s determination of citizenship, which requires \"convincing and decisive evidence.\"117 Claimant argues that the passports and consular declarations of SER owners and directors establish a presumption of Italian nationality that Respondent has only sought to rebut with allegations on how an Italian national could lose citizenship, without concrete evidence.118\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 29.\n\n110.\n\nAs to the proof of control over Campos de Pes\u00e9, Claimant argues that evidence of majority ownership creates a presumption of control. According to Claimant, the tribunal in *Caratube*119 established that such presumption applies unless there are elements to create doubt about the owner's actual control.120 Claimant cites *Cable TV v. St. Kitts and Nevis,121* where the tribunal found that the claimant cable companies were controlled by nationals of the United States for the purposes of Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention, considering that both the holding and operating companies were 99.9% owned, and therefore controlled, by nationals of the United States.122 According to Claimant, it has submitted evidence that the Italian owners and directors controlled SER, and that SER controlled Campos de Pes\u00e9, creating a presumption of control that Respondent has failed to rebut.123\n\n*Caratube International Oil Co., LLP v.

Jurisdiction *ratione personae*\n----------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nClaimant argues that Campos de Pes\u00e9 meets the definition of an investor under Article (I)2 of the BIT, since it is an entity established in the territory of Panama \"controlled directly or indirectly\" by Italian nationals \u2014the owners and directors of SER\u2014 at the relevant dates.124\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 35.\n\n*a. Relevant dates*\n-------------------\n\n112.\n\nClaimant dismisses Respondent's suggestion that jurisdiction should also be assessed as of 2011, when Campos de Pes\u00e9 invested in Panama.125 According to Claimant, *ratione personae* jurisdiction should be assessed as of 2014, when Panama breached the BIT, and as of 2020, when the Parties consented to arbitration.126 Claimant argues that, on the one hand, Article IX of the BIT only requires a potential claimant to qualify as an investor at the date of the breach (August 2014) and it does not establish any timeframe for the direct or indirect control.127 On the other hand, Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention focuses on the date of consent, which is the date of submission of the request for arbitration, in this case, 4 May 2020.128 Claimant argues that the owners and directors of SER were Italian nationals that controlled Campos de Pes\u00e9 at both these relevant dates.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 39.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 38.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n*b. Italian nationality*\n------------------------\n\n113.\n\nClaimant asserts that the passports and consular declarations presented to this Tribunal prove that the owners and directors of SER were Italian nationals at the relevant dates, and continue to be Italian nationals.129 First, it is for Italy to decide who are its nationals, and, in this case, there is no evidence of fraud or irregularities that cast doubt on Italy\u2019s decision to grant the Italian nationality to the owners and directors of SER.130 Second, if the Tribunal were to analyze the Italian nationality, it should not replace national authorities but should accord great weight to national laws and their interpretation.131 Moreover, the Tribunal should not apply the \"dominant and effective nationality\" test, which should be restricted to diplomatic protection cases, as found in *Saba Fakes v. Turkey.*132 In this regard, Claimant argues that Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention does not condition the nationality requirement to its \"effectiveness\" nor does it exclude claims of investors who are dual nationals, insofar as they do not hold the nationality of the host state, which is not the case at hand. Lastly, Claimant adds that the SER owners and directors acquired their Italian nationality long before 2014, and it was not with the purpose of gaining investment treaty benefits.133\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 46.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 52.\n\n*Saba Fakes v.

In fact, Mr. Pellas has publicly acted as Italian and kept ties with the country, while Mr. Palazio's Nicaraguan nationality does not exclude his Italian nationality under Nicaraguan laws.137\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 64.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 64-71.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 75.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 76-79.\n\n115.\n\nClaimant also asserts that the SER owners and directors have not lost their Italian citizenship. Under Italian and Nicaraguan laws, the mere acquisition of a foreign nationality is not sufficient to cause the loss of either nationality; a voluntary act or decision is required for such loss to occur. Pursuant to the 1917 Citizenship Convention between Italy and Nicaragua \"their respective citizens could emigrate to the other country, and both retain and pass down their citizenship to their children, pursuant to their respective national laws.\"138 Lastly, Claimant has submitted consular declarations from the Italian embassy in Managua, confirming that none of the SER owners and directors have renounced their Italian citizenship.139\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 80-88.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 89.\n\n*c.

In either version, the investor must be directly or indirectly \"controlled\" *or* \"managed\" \u2014not \"owned\"\u2014 by Italians.140 Likewise, under the ICSID Convention, domestic companies may bring claims against their host States on the basis of foreign control.141 According to Claimant, while the term \"control\" is not defined in the BIT or the ICSID Convention, it is broad enough to encompass \"the legal capacity to control,\" which the tribunal in *AIG Capital Partners*142 identified with the \"voting control of the stock.\"143 Claimant refers to *Plama v. Bulgaria,*144 where indirect and beneficial ownership was distinguished from control as the ability to, in fact, \"exercise substantial influence over the legal entity's management, operation and the selection of members of its Board of directors or any other managing body.\"145 Claimant adds that the term \"controlled\" should be defined both under international law and BVI laws, since SER is a BVI146 company.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 92.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\n*AIG Capital Partners, Inc. v.

Kazakhstan*147, Claimant asserts that majority ownership in a company creates a presumption of control under international law. Claimant adds that such presumption is stronger when the applicable corporate laws and the by-laws of a company \"grant governing control over the company to its majority shareholders.\"148 According to Claimant, control for the purposes of jurisdiction is not determined by the shareholder\u2019s \"percentage ownership of the ultimate underlying assets,\" as argued by Respondent\u2019s expert, Ms. Kunsman, but by the shareholder\u2019s power to control the company \"by voting their shares, and a simple majority.\"149\n\n*Caratube International Oil Co., LLP v.

According to Claimant, this majority shareholding of SER creates a presumption of control over Campos de Pes\u00e9.151 Italian nationals, through the SER Board of Directors (mainly composed by Italian nationals), controlled both PSE and Campos de Pes\u00e9.152\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 148.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 146, \u00b6 151.\n\n120.\n\nClaimant contends that, unlike the case of *Guardian Fiduciary Trust*153 cited by Respondent,154 in this case, there is no \"split control\" over Campos de Pes\u00e9, since the 26 Individuals \u2014allegedly Italian nationals\u2014 owned at the relevant times the majority of SER\u2019s shares, thus, controlling the company and its subsidiaries. As evidence of such control, Claimant argues that under the SER\u2019s memorandum and articles of association (\"**M&A**\"), all common shares in the company have one vote for all matters requiring shareholder approval. Such matters are decided by the majority of present votes save for \"special matters.\" Also, the majority of shareholders can appoint the Board of Directors of SER and amend its M&A.155 Considering these powers and Mr. Newton\u2019s expert report, Claimant argues that under BVI laws, the 26 Individuals \u2014allegedly Italian nationals\u2014 holding a majority of common shares of SER and \"acting in unison\", could control voting power over the company and its Board of Directors.156 Claimant adds that SER\u2019s shareholders have exercised these powers to control in their annual meetings,157 appointing multiple Board of Directors, and amending the articles of association, where the \"approval of the Italian Shareholders was needed to pass the matters.\"158\n\n*Guardian Fiduciary Trust, Ltd, f/k/a Capital Conservator Savings & Loan, Ltd v.

Claimant asserts that \"there was no separation of legal ownership from beneficial ownership that deprived the Italian shareholders of their control over their shares in SER.\"161 According to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s experts mistakenly focus on beneficial ownership laws and on the \"final beneficiary\" definition under Panamanian law to define who controls a Panamanian entity. Relying on the opinion of its expert, Mr. Mora, Claimant argues that under the Corporation Law of Panama (Law 32 of 1927), the shareholders \u2014and not the final beneficiaries\u2014 are the ones that have \"the ultimate control of the corporation.\"162 Regarding BVI laws, Claimant agrees with Respondent that the concept of ultimate beneficiaries was not regulated in the BVI Business Companies Act of 2004 (the **\"BVI Companies Act\").** According to Claimant, this concept was first introduced in the Beneficial Ownership Secure Search System Act **(\"BOSS Act\")** only as a regulatory report of beneficial owners of BVI companies but does not determine who has \"the legal capacity to control.\"163 Instead, as explained by Mr. Newton, the ultimate controllers of the voting shares and the directors of a BVI company are the ones who control a BVI company under BVI laws.164\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 166.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 167-169.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 170.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 170-171.\n\n123.\n\nClaimant further clarified the situation of the Italian individuals that allegedly controlled SER and Campos de Pes\u00e9 through [REDACTED] *i.e.,* Carlos Pellas, Ernesto Palazio, and [REDACTED] and Respondent's allegations on the identity of the owner of [REDACTED] as follows:\n\ni. Control by Carlos Pellas\n---------------------------\n\n124.\n\nRegarding Mr. Pellas, Claimant first observes that what is relevant for the purposes of jurisdiction in this case, is not whether he owned or was the final beneficiary of [REDACTED] the [REDACTED] or the [REDACTED] but rather whether he controlled them.165 Claimant affirms that Mr. Pellas controlled the [REDACTED] and thus [REDACTED], the [REDACTED] andultimately [REDACTED] which was the direct owner of SER\u2019s shares.166\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 173.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 183.\n\n125.\n\nClaimant explains that [REDACTED] is a BVI company,167 and that its shares were held by [REDACTED] a Cayman Islands company that was the sole [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], established under the laws of Cayman Islands by a [REDACTED] of 19 April 2013 between [REDACTED] and Mr. Pellas (the **\"[REDACTED] Instrument\"**),modified on 28 June 2018 to exclude the requirement of Mr. Pellas\u2019 consent [REDACTED] (the **\"Amended [REDACTED] Instrument\"**).168Mr. Pellas was director of [REDACTED] with \"extensive control.\"169 The shares of [REDACTED] were held by [REDACTED], as the sole [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED], a [REDACTED] established under Cayman Island laws by [REDACTED], as original [REDACTED] and Mr. Pellas was the [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] (the [REDACTED]\").170\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 174.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 174-176.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 177, \u00b6 181.\n\n126.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Mr. Pellas had extensive powers as [REDACTED] under the [REDACTED]Instrument and as [REDACTED] under the [REDACTED]. They include (1) the removal and appointment of [REDACTED] (2) preventing [REDACTED] from transferring any ownership interest of [REDACTED] in SER or any of its subsidiaries without his consent; (3) the \"unfettered\" right to [REDACTED] in the case of the [REDACTED] (4) the right to [REDACTED] in the case of the [REDACTED] ; (5) the requirement of his consent for any amendment of the [REDACTED] Instrument; and (6) also the requirement of his consent for any amendment of the articles of association of [REDACTED] that changes the director of the company, the way a director is appointed or removed, the voting rights of a director of the company, and the powers of a director of the company, being Mr. Pellas the director.171\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 175. \u00b6 181.\n\nii. Control by Ernesto Palazio\n------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nClaimant argues that Mr. Palazio has control over both the [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED], which hold the shares in SER. Claimant explains that both [REDACTED] were established under the laws of Delaware under two [REDACTED] agreements between Mr. Palazio as [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED] as [REDACTED] (the **\"[REDACTED] Instrument\"** and the \"**[REDACTED] Instrument\"**, respectively). These [REDACTED] have 100% of the shares of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], the companies that directly own SER\u2019s shares.172\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 188-191.\n\n128.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the provisions in the [REDACTED] Instrument and the [REDACTED] Instrument are identical and act as \"will substitutes\" that grant Mr. Palazio as [REDACTED] \"effective dominion over and control of [REDACTED] assets during his lifetime.\"173 Those powers include control over the net income of the [REDACTED] fund, appointment or removal of the [REDACTED] by the \"[REDACTED] Committee\" being Mr. Palazio the initial member, control of investments and voting rights by the \"[REDACTED] Committee\" being Mr. Palazio the initial member, [REDACTED] in whole or in part, and amending the [REDACTED] agreement.174\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 192\u2014194.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 192.\n\n129.\n\nLastly, regarding Ernesto Palazio\u2019s control over [REDACTED], Claimant asserts that he and [REDACTED] co-owned and controlled the company in August 2014 and May 2020.175\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 100.\n\niii. [REDACTED]\n---------------\n\n130.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that [REDACTED] do not have the same control over the shares in SER as Mr. Pellas and Mr. Palazio, since they are [REDACTED] of two [REDACTED]. However, the [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED], both established under the laws of the Island of Guernsey, have [REDACTED] an Italian company, as original [REDACTED]. Thus, \"these [REDACTED] are controlled by Italians.\"176\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 184-187.\n\niv. [REDACTED]\n--------------\n\n131.\n\nClaimant clarifies that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] were the same person with one name in Spanish and the other in Italian. Furthermore, Claimant explains that [REDACTED] was incorporated in April 2003 by [REDACTED] passed in 2014 and his shares were transferred to [REDACTED], his mother, and siblings. In 2015, the shares of [REDACTED] mother and siblings were transferred to him, and he became the sole owner of the company. Both [REDACTED] were Italian nationals at all relevant times.177\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 196-199.\n\n(iii) The SER Board of Directors controlled Campos de Pes\u00e9\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Board of Directors\n--------------------------\n\n132.\n\nClaimant refers to Mr. Newton's expert opinion to argue that, under BVI laws and the M&A, the SER Board of Directors had the powers to \"manage and control\" the affairs of SER, which included the affairs of Campos de Pes\u00e9 as its subsidiary.178 Claimant further argues that the majority of the Board of Directors of SER were Italian nationals, and that evidence of their control over Campos de Pes\u00e9 is found, first, in their approval of the acquisition of a stake in Campos de Pes\u00e9 from Grupo Alcoholes in 2009, and a subsequent increase in PSE's ownership interest in Campos de Pes\u00e9 to 70%.179\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 110-111.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 113.\n\n133.\n\nSecond, Claimant asserts that the Board of Directors of SER also controlled PSE and, in turn, Campos de Pes\u00e9 as its subsidiary through a Shareholder Agreement entered into with Grupo Alcoholes. Under this agreement, the majority of the Board of Directors of PSE (five members) was appointed by SER, and Grupo Alcoholes could appoint two members.180\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 112-114.\n\n134.\n\nThird, Claimant asserts that the Board of Directors of SER voted unanimously in multiple decisions over the management and control of PSE, as well as the decision to guarantee credit facilities taken by Campos de Pes\u00e9. Lastly, the Board of Directors of SER supervised the Board of PSE, which managed Campos de Pes\u00e9, and both Boards shared a common member, Carlos Pellas.181\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 115-116.\n\n(b) Carlos Pellas as director\n-----------------------------\n\n135.\n\nClaimant argues that while control over Campos de Pes\u00e9 was \"legally and factually\" held by the Italian individuals and the SER Board of Directors, Carlos Pellas \"exerted a comparable level of control\" because he occupied a \"power position\" considering that he was the single largest shareholder in SER with 21.85% of shares and the Chairman of the Boards of Directors of both SER and PSE.182 Claimant refers to *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* where the tribunal found no evidence that a minority shareholder with a directive role in the company \"acted or was materially influential in a truly managerial rather than technical or supervisory vein [as] [a]t all times he was subject to the direction of the Managing Director ... who himself apparently controlled the largest single block of shares ... and who in turn responded to the board of directors, of which Mr. and Mrs. Panagiotopulos were but two members.\"183 Claimant argues that, contrary to *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,*184 in this case, Carlos Pellas had clear roles that allowed him to control SER and its subsidiaries, considering that he was not subject to the authority of other individuals. Instead, Mr. Pellas was \"the highest officer\" and the single largest shareholder. Also, he was in charge of directive tasks, such as supervising the investment of Campos de Pes\u00e9 in bioethanol production, executing loan guarantees for Campos de Pes\u00e9, and concluding financial agreements.185\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 120-121.\n\n*Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. v.

Republic of Ghana, ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1, Award, 16 February 1994 [RL-0008].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127.\n\n**VI. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The burden of proof**\n--------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it has the burden to prove the nationality of the 26 Individuals as well as their control over Campos de Pes\u00e9 and that Respondent has the burden to prove its objections to jurisdiction. This means that Claimant must prove the facts that support its allegation that the 26 Individuals who are claimed to be Italian shareholders, had control over Claimant.\n\n137.\n\nBefore proceeding into the analysis of the facts and the evidence submitted by Claimant the Tribunal must refer to the timing of production of relevant documents by Claimant, and to the reluctance of Mr. Pellas and Mr. Palazio to appear before this Tribunal.\n\n138.\n\nThe alleged control of Claimant by 26 Individuals who claimed to be Italian nationals was structured through a network of complicated corporate and trust structures in various jurisdictions that required, on the one hand, a complete disclosure of the documentation supporting the structure \u2014subject, of course, to the confidentiality and reserve that applied in this arbitration\u2014 and, on the other hand, an explanation of the structure and evidence of the acts of control allegedly exercised by Mr. Pellas.\n\n139.\n\nIn connection with the documentation supporting the structure, Claimant initially claimed confidentiality over sections of the trust agreements that were relevant for the structure that evidenced the alleged control, and then, in its Rejoinder, decided to submit the documents that were allegedly reserved and confidential, together with expert evidence related to such documents. Respondent was therefore placed in a position where it could not submit additional expert evidence to question the new documents, but rather question the experts on such new evidence during the Hearing.\n\n140.\n\nAs regards the acts of control allegedly performed by Mr. Pellas, Respondent is correct in that a significant number of assertions made by Claimant in its submissions to support the facts related to such purported control relied on the testimonies of Messrs. Palazio and Pellas. Both were called by Respondent for cross-examination during the Hearing and the Tribunal expressly indicated its interest in hearing Messrs. Palazio and Pellas.\n\n141.\n\nThe Parties had agreed that the Hearing was open to the public and only a few weeks before the Hearing, Claimant first requested that the Hearing be closed to the public invoking issues of security and confidentiality that were not properly justified, much less proven. Finally, despite all reasonable solutions proposed by the Tribunal to facilitate the attendance of Messrs. Palazio and Pellas to the Hearing, and notwithstanding the lack of proper justification of their requests, they decided not to appear.\n\n142.\n\nRespondent requested, and Claimant did not object to, the exclusion of their testimonies, the lack of which creates gaps in the evidence submitted to support the facts alleged by Claimant. Such evidentiary gap is only attributable to the unjustified reluctance of Messrs. Palazio and Pellas to comply with their obligation to appear at the Hearing.\n\n**B. The legal framework**\n--------------------------\n\n143.\n\nArticle I(2) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"2. The term \"investor\" includes, for each of the Contracting Parties, the following persons that have made or will make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the present Agreement:\n\nAny individual who is a national of one of the Contracting Parties, pursuant to its legislation;\n\nb) **Any juridical person**, whether a profit or non-profit organization, **established in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties pursuant to its internal legislation**, and which has its corporate address in the same, or **which is controlled directly or indirectly by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties** or by legal entities with a corporate address in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and incorporated pursuant to their legislation.\"186\n\n**CL-0001**, Agreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of the Republic of Panama on the Promotion and Protection of Investments signed in Venice, Italy on 6 February 2009.\n\n144.\n\nIn turn, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and **a national of another Contracting State**, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and **any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention**.\"\n\n145.\n\nInvoking the aforementioned articles, Claimant asserts that this Tribunal has jurisdiction because the evidence on the record proves that Claimant is controlled, directly or indirectly, by 26 Individuals and all such individuals are Italian nationals. Respondent challenges both control and nationality.\n\n146.\n\nEven though the Parties have made submissions and presented evidence on the nationality of the direct and indirect shareholders of Claimant, both Claimant and Respondent have placed special emphasis and have devoted most of their allegations and evidence to the issue of control. For the purposes of this dispute, Article I(2) of the BIT requires direct or indirect control, on the one hand, and that such direct or indirect control be exercised by Italian nationals. Consequently, the Tribunal must first determine whether Claimant is controlled by the 26 Individuals who, according to Claimant, are Italian nationals. If there is control by such individuals, then the Tribunal must determine whether they have the Italian nationality. If there is no control, the debate on nationality becomes moot.\n\n147.\n\nOn the issue of control, the Parties do not dispute that the \"control\" referred to in Article I(2)(b) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention may be legal or de facto187 and that if a shareholder holds the majority of the shares in a company or corporation, there is a presumption that such shareholder controls the company or corporation, absent evidence to the contrary.188\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 93.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 96: \"Evidence of actual exercise of control is required, such as through exercise of voting rights, particularly where an investor has not established ownership of the investment that would generally imply the legal right or capacity to exercise control.\"; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 142-143.\n\n148.\n\nIt is undisputed that none of the 26 Individuals who claim to be Italian nationals individually holds, directly or indirectly, the majority of the shares of Campos de Pes\u00e9.189 Therefore, the presumption of control does not apply individually to any of the 26 Individuals.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 58; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 36.\n\n149.\n\nThe Parties do not differ in that the legal control of Campos de Pes\u00e9 is a matter that must be established under Panamanian law, the law of the place of incorporation, and the jurisdiction in which it operates,190 and that the legal control of SER is a matter that must be established under the laws of the BVI, the law of the place of incorporation and the jurisdiction in which it operates.191\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 95; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 126.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 95.\n\n150.\n\nIt is also undisputed and supported by the evidence submitted before this Tribunal that, at all relevant times, PSE has held 100% of the shares of Campos de Pes\u00e9, and in turn, that SER has individually held the majority of the shares of PSE, also at all relevant times.\n\n**C. The relevant dates**\n-------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Parties agree that one of the relevant dates for the purposes of jurisdiction is August 2014, the date of the alleged breach,192 and they do not seem to have a substantial dispute on the relevance of the date in which Claimant expressed its consent to arbitration by filing the corresponding claim. Respondent, however, adds that the date of the investment (2011) is also relevant to establish jurisdiction, but Claimant disagrees.193\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 48.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 48.\n\n152.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal will conclude that there was neither control on the date of the alleged breach nor control on the date of the filing of this arbitration, it does not need to analyze whether Claimant should have also established control on the date of the investment, as alleged by Respondent.\n\n**D. The forms of control according to Claimant**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nClaimant submits that \"it proved control of Campos de Pes\u00e9 by Italian nationals in three different ways\":194 (1) majority ownership; (2) control over Claimant through the Board of Directors of SER; and (3) control through the actions of Carlos Pellas. The Tribunal will refer in the following paragraphs to each such forms of control and to the evidence submitted in support of each alleged form of control.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 60.\n\n1. Control by majority ownership\n--------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAs noted above, it is undisputed that at all relevant times Campos de Pes\u00e9 was 100% owned by PSE, and in turn, that the majority of PSE's shares have been held individually by SER.\n\n155.\n\nClaimant argues that the 26 Individuals collectively owned the majority of shares in SER, (i) some of them directly, (ii) some others through corporations in which they were allegedly controlling shareholders, and (iii) some others through trusts that they allegedly control, which trusts in turn, control corporations that are the direct shareholders of SER, which in turn controls Campos de Pes\u00e9 through PSE.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to Claimant, this collective and majoritarian ownership over SER's shares (a) creates a \"legal presumption\" of control under international law, and (b) evidences *de facto* control by the 26 Individuals because they voted their shares \"in concert\" to appoint SER's Board of Directors and to amend its M&A.195\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\n157.\n\nMoreover, \"as a matter of practice\", the alleged Italian individuals who indirectly held shares in SER through holding companies frequently attended SER shareholder meetings to vote their shares in SER.196\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 105.\n\n*a. Legal control of Campos de Pes\u00e9 under Panamanian law*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nClaimant's case is that 26 Individuals control SER (a BVI company) which in turn controls Claimant and therefore, the 26 Individuals indirectly have legal control of Claimant.\n\n159.\n\nNone of the 26 Individuals are registered in the books and records of Claimant in Panama as a shareholder of Claimant. Therefore, there is no direct legal control of Claimant by one or more of the 26 Individuals. However, Claimant argued that the 26 Individuals had indirect control of Claimant and submitted the expert report of a Panamanian lawyer, Mr. Jaime Mora, to support its allegation.\n\n160.\n\nMr. Mora in his expert testimony opined that the 26 Individuals had control of Claimant under Panamanian law. However, during the cross-examination at the Hearing he explained that under the laws of Panama the direct control of Campos the Pes\u00e9 is only exercised by its shareholders (*i.e*., PSE).197 Mr. Mora was also questioned on whether there is a legal provision in Panama that defines or refers to indirect control. He indicated that there is no such provision either under Panamanian Law No. 32 or the Commercial Code of Panama.198\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 190: 11-22 - 191: 1-8.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 199: 2-22 - 200: 1-2.\n\n161.\n\nMr. Mora was specifically asked in cross-examination to opine on the shareholding chart prepared and submitted by Claimant in this arbitration as Exhibit C-204-1. The chart contains 23 pages, each one picturing the corporate or trust structure under which one or more of the 26 Individuals allegedly controlled Claimant as of June 2011, August 2014, and May 2020. An example of one of the charts is copied below (see Exhibit C-204-1, page 3. Exhibit redacted for confidentiality).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n162.\n\nThe question put by Respondent to the expert referred to whether the individuals *\"at the end of [the] chain\"* (green boxes)199 who allegedly control the trusts and corporations that are shareholders of SER (the 26 Individuals who allegedly control SER, the shareholder of Claimant, and possess Italian nationality), had control of Claimant. Mr. Mora testified that such individuals do not have control or management over a Panamanian company under Panamanian law and, accordingly, under said law the individuals have *\"neither direct nor indirect\"* control over Claimant.200\n\nThe expert replied when submitted with page 12 of Exhibit C-204-1 but was presented with the entire set of charts found in the same Exhibit, all of which contained green boxes representing the 26 Individuals.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 195: 9-11, 196: 11-22 - 197: 1-9.\n\n163.\n\nIn sum, from the evidence submitted by Claimant it is clear for the Tribunal that, first, legal control of Panamanian companies is exercised by the shareholders; second, none of the 26 Individuals who allegedly control Claimant is a shareholder of Claimant; third, there is no provision under Panamanian law that refers to control through indirect ownership or management; and fourth and last, under Panamanian law none of the 26 Individuals, who allegedly are Italian nationals, exercises legal control over Claimant.\n\n*b. Legal control of SER under BVI law*\n---------------------------------------\n\n(i) Control by the shareholders of SER\n--------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nClaimant argues that since the 26 Individuals control SER, which in turn controls Claimant, they indirectly control Claimant.\n\n165.\n\nAs a starting point the Tribunal observes that only 13 out of the 26 Individuals \u2014allegedly Italian nationals\u2014, representing a minority of less than 12% of the shareholdings of SER, were registered as shareholders of SER.201 The other 13 individuals were not.202\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 155: Figure 1: Share Ownership in SER as of August 2014 by Italian Individuals and Trusts.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 159: 3-17.\n\n166.\n\nNo evidence was submitted in this arbitration of an agreement amongst the 26 Individuals that imposes on them the obligation to vote in a given sense or to collectively exercise their rights on SER, either directly for those registered as shareholders, or indirectly through their corporate structures for those who are not shareholders.203\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 160: 22 - 161: 1-7.\n\n167.\n\nClaimant heavily relies on Mr. Newton's expert report to assert that \"[u]nder BVI law, the capacity to \"control\" and \"manage\" a company would typically require an individual or group of individuals acting in unison to be able to control voting power to the degree that they can amend the Memorandum and Articles of Association and appoint or remove members of the Board of Directors.\"204\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 93.\n\n168.\n\nAccording to Claimant, a group of individuals with sufficient voting power to amend the M&A and appoint and remove the members of the Board of Directors is said to have control and management over a company when \"acting in unison.\"205 Therefore, says Claimant, a group of shareholders may exercise control even if there is no agreement for all the shareholders to vote in a given sense. The mere fact of voting together in one same sense (in \"unison\", in the words of Mr. Newton), even in the absence of a prior agreement to do so, results in control of the company or corporation.206\n\nFirst Legal Expert Opinion of Christopher Newton, \u00b6\u00b6 4.1-4.2.\n\nFirst Legal Expert Opinion of Christopher Newton, \u00b6 4.3.\n\n169.\n\nHowever, neither Claimant nor Mr. Newton cite a provision of BVI law defining voting in \"unison\" or establishing that voting in \"unison\", by itself, amounts to legal control over the company or corporation by a group of individuals.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the expert testimony of Mr. Newton was submitted with Claimant's Rejoinder, together with the portions of the trust agreements that Claimant initially claimed were confidential, and therefore, Mr. Mark Forte, the expert of Respondent, was granted during the Hearing the opportunity to present his comments, and conclusions on Mr. Newton's legal expert opinions.\n\n171.\n\nIn redirect during the Hearing, Mr. Forte presented his comments to Mr. Newton's report and presented his conclusions.207 Claimant chose not to cross-examine Mr. Forte and therefore his opinion and conclusions are uncontested.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 158: 12-15.\n\n172.\n\nAccording to Mr. Forte, under BVI law, for a group of shareholders to be considered to exercise control over a company or corporation, the mere act of voting together is not sufficient. There should be evidence of some agreement \"or other record of alignment\" to vote together in the same sense.208 Absent an agreement or a record of alignment, each shareholder maintains the right to vote as it sees fit and there would not be a controlling group. They may vote in the same sense in one or more decisions, but that does not imply that they exercise control.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 167: 18-22 - 168:1-14.\n\n173.\n\nMr. Newton and Mr. Forte disagreed on the relevance of the BOSS Act under BVI law for purposes of establishing control. The BOSS Act requires that corporations established in the BVI report the names of the beneficial owners of the company or corporation. Claimant and its expert are correct in that the BOSS Act is not a corporate registry or evidence of control under BVI corporate law. Nothing in the record suggests otherwise. However, report or lack thereof under the BOSS Act may be an indication of the existence or absence of control.\n\n174.\n\nMr. Forte explained, and his expert testimony was not questioned or challenged, that reporting under the BOSS Act is mandatory, not merely voluntary. He further explained that the fact that the alleged Italian individuals or their corporations and trusts were not reported as controlling SER is an indication under BVI law that they do not consider themselves as having control. While they each may not own the percentage of shares to individually be controlling entities, if they could \"otherwise exercise control,\"209 for instance, by having an agreement to act in unison, they should be reported as controlling beneficial owners, but they were not.210\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 166: 1-13.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 167: 18-22 - 168:1-4.\n\n175.\n\nAs discussed in paragraph 210 *infra,* only [REDACTED] but there is no evidence that such registration was in effect on the relevant dates.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does not consider that under BVI law the mere fact that the 26 Individuals have voted certain decisions \"in unison\" is sufficient to establish legal control of SER by such shareholders.\n\n(ii) The [REDACTED]\n-------------------\n\n177.\n\n[REDACTED] is a BVI company that held 21.68% of the shares in SER as of May 2020, and 20.70% as of August 2014. Claimant's case is that Mr. Pellas controls [REDACTED] and such company, in turn, is a shareholder of SER and an indirect shareholder of Claimant. Out of the 26 Individuals who claim to be both Italian nationals and direct or indirect shareholders of SER, Mr. Pellas is the one holding the majority of the alleged shareholding participation in SER. Without the shares allegedly controlled by Mr. Pellas, the 26 Individuals would not have \u2014directly or indirectly\u2014 the majority of the votes.\n\n178.\n\nTherefore, whether Mr. Pellas controls [REDACTED] is determinative for the resolution of legal control of SER by the 26 Individuals. Even in the scenario submitted by Claimant, where voting together could be considered control, if Mr. Pellas' percentages of participation are excluded, the 26 Individuals would not have the majority of the shares of SER.\n\n179.\n\nClaimant submits that the shares of SER were held by [REDACTED] (BVI), whose shares were [REDACTED] by the [REDACTED] with [REDACTED] (CYM) as the [REDACTED] shares are held by the [REDACTED] (CYM) of which [REDACTED] is the [REDACTED] Mr. Pellas is the [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] The structure on the relevant dates according to Claimant was as follows:211\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 208: 17-22 - 209: 1-12: Lindley\u2019s presentation.\n\n180.\n\nThe evidence submitted by Claimant in this arbitration contains serious gaps and inconsistencies that do not allow the Tribunal to conclude that Mr. Pellas controlled [REDACTED]\n\n181.\n\nClaimant and its experts on BVI and Cayman law focused on proving the powers of Mr. Pellas in [REDACTED]\n\n182.\n\nMr. Pellas is the [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] (CYM) and the director of [REDACTED] (CYM) where he retained broad powers under its articles of association.212\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 227: 1-15, 231: 3-22, 232: 1-13.\n\n183.\n\nMr. Pellas is also the [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] and as [REDACTED] he retained ample powers over the [REDACTED] itself, including the power to [REDACTED], [REDACTED] to himself at any time, and the power to grant or refuse consent for the transfer of any ownership interest in SER.213\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 223: 1-22.\n\n184.\n\nBut whatever the powers that Mr. Pellas may have on each of the [REDACTED] participating in the chain that he structured, the relevant issue in order to determine control by Mr. Pellas is whether the [REDACTED] he allegedly controlled, in turn, controlled [REDACTED] (*i.e*., the BVI company that directly own shares in SER).\n\n185.\n\nNeither the documents submitted by Claimant nor the expert report of Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Mander, evidence that the [REDACTED] allegedly controlled by Mr. Pellas have control over [REDACTED]. In particular, there is no persuasive evidence that [REDACTED] owns the shares of [REDACTED] and the documents submitted raise serious doubts as to their true dates and even their authenticity.\n\n186.\n\nMr. Lindley, Respondent\u2019s expert, indicated during his examination at the Hearing that Claimant did not submit, and therefore he did not have access, to conclusive evidence that [REDACTED] owns the shares of [REDACTED] He further indicated that the evidence submitted by Claimant contained a serious inconsistency. [REDACTED] was allegedly allotted 5,000 shares in [REDACTED] but according to the register submitted as evidence by Claimant, the allocation of shares was made to [REDACTED] on a date that preceded the one on which [REDACTED] came into existence, which is not legally possible.214\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 210: 10-22 - 211: 1-3.\n\n187.\n\nThe register of members of [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED] Memorandum and Articles of Association state that [REDACTED] was incorporated on 10 January 2013. However, the register of members of [REDACTED] states that [REDACTED] as [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] was allotted 5,000 ordinary shares of [REDACTED] on 7 October 2005,215 this is more than seven years before [REDACTED] came into existence. Moreover, [REDACTED] has an authorized capital of 10,000 shares, out of which only 5,000 have been issued and allocated,216 and there is no evidence of [REDACTED] owning 10,000 shares.217\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 211: 4-16.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 212: 2-7.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 240: 19-22 - 241: 1-16.\n\n188.\n\nClaimant decided not to cross-examine Mr. Lindley on this point and therefore his findings remain uncontested. Moreover, in cross-examination, Mr. Mander, Claimant\u2019s expert, recognized that the registry of members of [REDACTED] submitted as evidence is \"clearly incorrect\", precisely because it recorded [REDACTED] as shareholder before it even existed.218\n\nTranscript Hearing 21 June 2023, 299: 7 - 301: 19.\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is no evidence that Mr. Pellas controlled, through [REDACTED], 20.7% of the shares of SER as of August 2014 or 21.68% of the shares of SER as of May 2020 (the relevant dates according to Claimant). In the absence of control of [REDACTED] by Mr. Pellas, the other individuals (25) who were allegedly Italian shareholders would not hold, directly or indirectly, the majority of the shares of SER on the said dates and therefore had no control of SER.\n\n*c. Control by attending shareholders meeting and voting in such meetings*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nClaimant argues that the 26 Individuals exerted their control over SER by attending shareholder meetings of the company and voting in such meetings in an aligned manner.\n\n191.\n\nIt is true that the 26 Individuals who are claimed to be Italian nationals attended the shareholder meetings of SER and voted in such meetings. However, the records of the shareholder voting of 2011 submitted in this arbitration indicate that except for [REDACTED] who were shareholders, voted their own shares and represented around 4.5% per cent of the shares of SER that year. The other individuals who voted in the shareholders meeting were not shareholders of SER and voted as \"proxies\" for the companies or trusts that they were representing.219 Therefore, they were not voting in their individual capacity but as representatives or attorneys in fact of companies and trusts. Consequently, even assuming that they are Italian nationals, their votes as proxies of companies or trusts would not result in such vote counting as the vote of an Italian national, but as the vote of the trust or the corporation (which are not Italian).\n\n**C-0240**, Quorum Tally for Attendance at SER Shareholding Meeting, 22 March 2011.\n\n192.\n\nTheir acting as proxies, however, may be an indication of *de facto* control by the given individuals, if there is sufficient evidence that the individual exercising the proxy controls (legally or *de facto*) the entity granting the proxy. But even if the shareholders, other than Mr. Pellas, had *de facto* control of SER, the evidence does not support the allegation that Mr. Pellas controlled [REDACTED] legally or *de facto* and therefore, without the percentage allegedly held by Mr. Pellas, the other 25 remaining individuals who were allegedly Italian shareholders, did not exercise legal or *de facto* control of SER.\n\n2. Control by the SER Board of Directors\n----------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nClaimant submits, on the one hand, that the SER Board of Directors was controlled by a majority of Italian nationals who thus controlled the company, and on the other, that it was the Italian nationals who \"retained the power to vote their shares and did so in a coordinated manner to elect a common slate of seven Italian nationals to the board.\"220\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 87.\n\n194.\n\nClaimant did not submit persuasive documentary evidence or legal basis to support its allegation that the foreign nationality of the members of a Board of Directors is, by itself, evidence of foreign control of a company or corporation. Admitting this submission would imply that by merely electing directors of the nationality required to be protected under a given investment treaty \u2014irrespective of the nationality of owners, shareholders, and/or controllers\u2014 a company could obtain the treaty protection it desires.\n\n195.\n\nBut even considering the aforementioned allegation in the context of Claimant's submission there is no persuasive evidence of control. Claimant notes that the control is evidenced by (a) how SER's shareholders voted their shares to indirectly elect the members of the Campos de Pes\u00e9 Board of Directors, and (b) how the SER Board of Directors controlled the operation of Campos de Pes\u00e9.\n\n196.\n\nClaimant argues that the 26 Individuals \u2014allegedly Italians\u2014 elected the members of the Board of Directors of SER,221 that SER elected the majority of the Board of Directors of PSE (5 out of 7), that PSE appointed the Board of Directors of Campos de Pes\u00e9 and therefore, that the 26 Individuals influenced the election of the Board of Directors of Campos de Pes\u00e9 by appointing the members of the SER Board of Directors and that the latter controlled the operation of Campos de Pes\u00e9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 135.\n\n197.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Campos de Pes\u00e9 was appointed by its shareholder, PSE, and the Board of Directors of the latter was appointed by SER. The SER Board of Directors was in turn appointed by its shareholders.\n\n198.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has already concluded that one of those shareholders \u2014 [REDACTED] who holds 20.7% of the shares of SER as of August 2014 and 21.6% as of May 2020\u2014 is not controlled by Mr. Carlos Pellas and therefore, the other 25 individuals who were allegedly Italian shareholders, do not have the majority to appoint the Board of Directors of SER. Consequently, the SER Board of Directors is not controlled by a majority of Italian shareholders.\n\n199.\n\nMoreover, to support its allegation of control over Campos de Pes\u00e9 by the SER Board of Directors, Claimant relies on a series of decisions of the SER Board of Directors.222 These decisions authorize SER to act as guarantor of loans obtained by Campos de Pes\u00e9 from third parties. In Claimant\u2019s own words, the SER Board caused SER \"to guarantee the loans to support that investment,\" which was the development of a bioethanol plant in Panama.223\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 87, \u00b6 117.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 129.\n\n200.\n\nHowever, a decision by a parent company to grant a guarantee in favor of its subsidiary to secure a third-party loan is not an act of control of the subsidiary by the parent company but rather an act related to the management of the parent company. There is no evidence that SER participated in the negotiation or approval of the loans or that the decision of Campos de Pes\u00e9 to develop the bioethanol plant was the result of the control allegedly exerted by the Italian nationals. Claimant recognizes that it was Campos de Pes\u00e9 who decided to increase its production capacity.224\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 118.\n\n201.\n\nIn sum, even though the decision to guarantee the loans is related to Campos de Pes\u00e9, it is not an act of management or control by SER of the operations or activities of Campos de Pes\u00e9 or evidence that the decision to invest in the biofuel production was made by the SER Board of Directors or at its direction, and not autonomously by Campos de Pes\u00e9.\n\n202.\n\nClaimant also argues that SER \"decided to use Campos de Pes\u00e9 at (sic) the main implementing vehicle of its bioethanol project.\" However, the record of such decision is found nowhere in the case file, and there is no evidence of the joint or collective intervention of the alleged Italian nationals in those decisions.\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is no persuasive evidence of control, \"active involvement\"225 or \"strategic decision making\" of the Italian nationals through SER in the operations of Campos de Pes\u00e9. The two individuals who may have shed light on this allegation \u2014Mr. Pellas and Mr. Palazio\u2014 decided not to attend the Hearing without proper justification.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 111.\n\n3. Control by Carlos Pellas\n---------------------------\n\n204.\n\nAccording to Claimant, evidence of Mr. Pellas\u2019 *de facto* control is found in that (i) he is the \"single largest shareholder in SER;\" (ii) he had the role of Chairman of the SER and PSE Boards of Directors;226 (iii) he was a member of the Board of Campos de Pes\u00e9 from 2010 until 2015;227 (iv) he had relevant roles in the operations of Campos de Pes\u00e9, specifically in overseeing Campos de Pes\u00e9's investment in bioethanol production in Panama, executing loans guarantees for Campos de Pes\u00e9, and concluding finance agreements;228 (v) in addition to his \"share ownership\" he \"often controlled a significant portion or close to the majority of SER shares during its shareholder meetings;\"229 and (vi) [REDACTED].230\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 120.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 126.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 138.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\n205.\n\nThe evidence on a substantive part of the alleged role of Mr. Pellas in Campos de Pes\u00e9 and particularly on whether that role could result in a *de facto* control of Claimant by Mr. Pellas, relies on the testimony of Mr. Pellas, which was stricken from the record given his unjustified decision not to attend the Hearing.\n\n206.\n\nIt is undisputed that Mr. Pellas is not a shareholder in SER and the Tribunal has already found no evidence of his alleged control of [REDACTED]\n\n207.\n\nIf Mr. Pellas voted as proxy of other SER shareholders, it does not prove that he had control of the shares he voted. Proxy votes may count as evidence of *de facto* control by the given individual if there is sufficient evidence that the individual controls (legally or *de facto)* the company, corporation or trust that is the actual shareholder in SER. There is no such evidence in the record.\n\n208.\n\nMr. Pellas' directive roles could demonstrate his involvement in the operations of Campos de Pes\u00e9, but only in a \"supervisory vein\"231 and not in a managerial role with individual decision-making power. There is no evidence in the record that while he served in SER or PSE, Mr. Pellas ever adopted any decision involving Campos de Pes\u00e9. The mere allegation of \"ample opportunity for control\"232 by Claimant is not enough.\n\n*Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. v. Republic of Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1, Award, 16 February 1994 [RL-0008], \u00b6 237.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 126.\n\n209.\n\nClaimant also submits that Mr. Pellas is [REDACTED] which would be an indication of control. As noted in paragraphs 164 and 165 *supra,* registration [REDACTED] could be an indication of control.\n\n210.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Pellas, the only evidence submitted by Claimant of his registration as [REDACTED]. The [REDACTED] does not indicate when the registration took place. Therefore, there is no evidence that the report on control was in place on the dates that the Parties have identified as relevant dates, that is, on the date when the challenged measures were taken, and on the date when the Request was submitted, which in the view of Claimant are the relevant dates for purposes of jurisdiction.\n\n211.\n\nMoreover, Claimant did not submit the [REDACTED], even though it had access to it, and the expert for Respondent, as mentioned below, indicated that the entire file was required to determine the reasons for the registration.\n\n212.\n\nRespondent's expert, Mr. Forte \u2014who was not cross-examined by Claimant\u2014 expressed doubts as to the registration under [REDACTED] because Mr. Pellas was not a direct shareholder of SER and, in any case, his alleged beneficial ownership through [REDACTED]\n\n213.\n\nMr. Forte further indicated that there was no clarity as to the grounds on which Mr. Pellas was reported as beneficial owner. Mr. Forte testified \u2014and Claimant did not challenge such testimony nor did it challenge [REDACTED] \u2014 that only the [REDACTED].234 In this regard, Mr. Forte stated during the Hearing that \"[T]he only explanation I feel I can come to from that as to why Mr. Pellas would have been reported [REDACTED] is that they do not actually exercise any control over SER as one definitive unified voting bloc. If they did control SER, they are not reported as doing so, and [REDACTED] The Company would be in breach.\"235\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 169: 14-22 - 170: 1-5.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 170: 17-22 - 171: 1-7.\n\n214.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant has not proven that Mr. Pellas controlled SER on all the relevant dates, neither legally or *de facto,* and neither directly nor through [REDACTED]\n\n**E. Nonattendance of Mr. Pellas and Mr. Palazio at the Hearing**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that there is no evidence of control, legal or *de facto,* by the 26 Individuals. It will now briefly refer to the consequences of the unjustified decision of Mr. Palazio and Mr. Pellas not to attend the Hearing, despite having been called for cross- examination, which final decision was communicated to the Tribunal just five days before the Hearing.236\n\nSee *supra,* \u00b6 30.\n\n216.\n\nAfter the decision of the aforementioned witnesses not to attend, Claimant alleged that it had sufficiently proven indirect control of Italian nationals over Campos de Pes\u00e9, and that no claim of adverse inferences over the nonattendance of Mr. Pellas and Mr. Palazio could \"contradict reality.\"237 However, the Tribunal finds that the testimonies of those witnesses was an essential part of the evidence submitted by Claimant and that their oral examination at the Hearing could have clarified issues that either lack evidence, or for which documents were not sufficient or for which documents required an explanation.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 131: 3-7.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to draw adverse inferences from the reluctance of Messrs. Palazio and Pellas, but agrees with Respondent as to the facts that remained unproven due to Mr. Pellas and Mr. Palazio\u2019s nonappearance:\n\n(a) That Mr. Pellas controlled Campos de Pes\u00e9 through the managing position that he held. In Respondent\u2019s words: There is no evidence \"suggesting that Carlos Pellas was involved in any way in making the decisions of the business and operation and activities of Campos de Pes\u00e9.\"238\n\n(b) That Mr. Pellas was the final beneficiary of 20% of SER and the controlling shareholder of Campos de Pes\u00e9 or SER.239\n\n(c) That the SER Board of Directors was involved in the decision making of Campos de Pes\u00e9,240 particularly in the relevant dates identified.\n\n(d) That Mr. Palazio was the final beneficiary of around 3% of SER.241\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 24: 1-4.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 24: 7-16.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 24: 17-22, 25: 1-5.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 25: 6-12.\n\n**VII. conclusion**\n-------------------\n\n218.\n\nBased on the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the 26 Individuals that allegedly hold Italian nationality did not control, directly or indirectly, legally or *de facto*, Campos de Pes\u00e9 and therefore Claimant is not a protected \"investor\" under article I(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n219.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims.\n\n**VIII.

Nonetheless, on 9 May 2023, Respondent requested the Tribunal to consider Claimant\u2019s \"misconduct\" in the production of evidence related to the alleged indirect control of SER for the purposes of the decision on the allocation of costs in this arbitration.245 At the Hearing, Respondent also requested that the Tribunal consider in the decision on costs the nonattendance of Messrs. Pellas and Palazio at the Hearing.246\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of 9 May 2023. See *infra,* \u00b6 222.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 78: 10-16. See *infra, \u00b6* 223-224.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1. The applicable rules on allocation of costs\n----------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nBoth the 2006 ICSID Rules and the ICSID Convention refer to costs in ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n225.\n\nArticle 28(2) of the ICSID Rules provides that \"[p]romptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding (...)\".\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal received the Parties\u2019 statements on costs on 8 September 2023.\n\n227.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that the \"(...) Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\"247\n\nICSID Convention, Article 61(2).\n\n228.\n\nIt is widely recognized that, pursuant to the aforementioned provisions \"ICSID tribunals exercise a large measure of discretion on deciding how and by which party such costs shall be paid.\"248\n\n*National Gas S.A.E v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/7, Award, 3 April 2014 [RL-0009], \u00b6 153.\n\n229.\n\nOn the basis of this discretion, ICSID tribunals have either followed a \"costs lie where they fall\" approach in which each party covers their own costs, or have applied the \"costs follow the event\" approach, deciding that the unsuccessful party shall cover all costs.249 As will be further developed in the following subsections, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant must cover all the costs in this arbitration (i) under the \"costs follow the event\" approach as the unsuccessful party in the arbitration, and (ii) in light of Claimant's conduct throughout the proceedings.\n\n*Guardian Fiduciary Trust, Ltd, f/k/a Capital Conservator Savings & Loan, Ltd v. Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/31, Award, 22 September 2015 [RL-0017], \u00b6 149-150.\n\n2. Respondent was successful in its jurisdictional defense\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nFor the reasons explained throughout this Award, Panama's objection to the Tribunal's *ratione personae* jurisdiction under Article I(2) of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention has prevailed. Consequently, Campos de Pes\u00e9's allegations have failed, and the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction.\n\n231.\n\nFollowing the \"costs follow the event\" approach, Claimant as the unsuccessful party is to bear all expenses incurred by both Campos de Pes\u00e9 and Panama.250\n\nSee *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010 [RL-0026], \u00b6 152.\n\n3. The procedural conduct of Campos de Pes\u00e9 merit that it bears all the fees and costs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nBut even if the Tribunal were not to follow the \"costs follow the event\" approach, the Tribunal has considered Claimant's procedural conduct, and, in particular, its multiple procedural requests, which have seriously impaired the smooth and expedited development of this proceeding, and particularly (1) the unreasonable delay in the production of documents relating to the ownership and control of SER, and (2) the last-minute notice of nonattendance of Mr. Pellas and Mr. Palazio to the Hearing.\n\n233.\n\nFirst, Claimant unreasonably delayed the production of relevant documents relating to alleged indirect ownership of SER, the identities of the managers and directors of each company and their nationalities.251 The Tribunal recalls that the Parties agreed to extend the deadline to file the pending submissions on jurisdiction \u2014 Reply and Rejoinder at that time\u2014,252 as Claimant had offered to gather and produce those documents.253 However, the documents were only produced in full with Claimant's Rejoinder and the Tribunal was seized with a request from Respondent to exclude such documents and had to make arrangements to deal with a situation where Respondent's Cayman Islands, BVI and Delaware law experts did not have the opportunity to rely on complete documentation for the Reply while Claimant's Rejoinder \"extensively relied\" on the documents previously considered by Claimant as \"irrelevant.\"254\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 119.\n\n**R-0151**, Chain of emails between Respondent\u2019s counsel and Claimant\u2019s counsel starting on 27 June 2022, p. 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of 9 May 2023, p. 4, Attachment 3, p. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of 9 May 2023, p. 4.\n\n234.\n\nSecond, as noted in the summary of the procedural history in Section II of this Award,255 despite the efforts of the Tribunal to accommodate the untimely and unjustified requests of Claimant for the appearance of Messrs. Palazio and Pellas at the Hearing, including the decision to close the Hearing to the public while they were testifying \u2014even though Procedural Order No. 1 provided for a public hearing\u2014, Claimant simply informed on 15 June 2023, just five days before the Hearing, that they would not appear to be cross-examined.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00b6 25-28.\n\n4. Conclusion\n-------------\n\n235.\n\nIn accordance with the foregoing, Claimant shall bear its own fees and expenses and the following amounts (in USD):\n\n(a) Respondent's legal fees, costs, and expenses: **USD $1,368,741.79**.\n\n(b) The costs of the arbitration proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees, and direct expenses, as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| (i) | Arbitral Tribunal Fees and Expenses: |  |\n|  | (1) Mr. Eduardo Zuleta: | USD $126,398.93 |\n|  | (2) Prof. Brigitte Stern: | USD $90,428.48 |\n|  | (3) Mr. Horacio Grigera-Na\u00f3n: | USD $107,888.57 |\n| (ii) | ICSID Administrative Fees: | USD $168,000 |\n| (iii) | Direct expenses | USD $82,494.56 |\n|  | **Total:** | **USD $575,210.54** |\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts in the total amount of USD $800,000.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will refund the balance left in the case account at the end of the proceeding in the same proportion as the advances were made *(i.e.,* 50%/50%).\n\nClaimant shall accordingly reimburse Respondent the amount of **USD $287,605.27** corresponding to the **USD $400,000** advanced by Respondent, plus the Respondent\u2019s share in the investment income accrued in the case account, amounting to **USD $11,311.55,** minus **USD $123,706.28**, to be reimbursed by the ICSID Secretariat to Respondent.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n236.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims filed by Claimant, Campos de Pes\u00e9, S.A., against Respondent, the Republic of Panama.\n\n(2) Claimant, Campos de Pes\u00e9, S.A., shall bear its own costs, fees, and expenses, the costs of this arbitration, and the fees, costs, and expenses of the Republic of Panama as per paragraph 235 of this Award.\n\n(3) All other requests for relief are rejected.\n\nDate: 28 February 2024"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Request for the Rectification of the Award", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2024-09-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Request for the Rectification of the Award\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 1 March 2024, the Tribunal composed of Eduardo Zuleta (President), Horacio Grigera (Co-arbitrator) and Brigitte Stern (Co-arbitrator) rendered its award (the \"**Award**\") in the matter between Campos de Pes\u00e9 S.A. (\"**Claimant**\") and the Republic of Panama (\"**Respondent**\") in ICSID Case No. ARB/20/19. That same day, ICSID's Secretary-General dispatched a certified copy of the Award to both Claimant and Respondent (jointly the \"**parties**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 12 April 2024, by way of a letter addressed to ICSID's Secretary-General, Claimant submitted a request for the rectification of the Award (the \"**Rectification Request**\") pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and ICSD Arbitration Rule 49 (2006). The Rectification Request was accompanied by \"Annex A\" containing correspondence between 2 March to 19 March 2024, and a copy of the Award labeled as \"Annex B. ICSID\". On the same day, ICSID received payment of the prescribed lodging fee.\n\n3.\n\nUnder the Rectification Request, Claimant sought the adjustment of clerical errors, which it divided into three sections: Section I \"Typographical Errors\", Section II \"Mis-citations\" and Section III \"Other Errors\". In the Rectification Request, Claimant also \"attached proposed redactions to the public version of the award\" as Section IV.1\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, pp.1, 7-8.\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 April 2024, ICSID's Secretary-General registered the Rectification Request and, following Arbitration Rule 49(2)(c) and (d), transmitted a copy of the Rectification Request to Respondent, and each Member of the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nOn 10 May 2024, Respondent commented on two items in Section II, and one item in Section III of the Rectification Request. Respondent had no comments on Section I of the Rectification Request. Further, Respondent objected to Claimant's request for redactions alleging that \"the Tribunal should protect and maintain the Parties' agreement on the publication of the Award, as set forth in Section 23.1 of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1.\"2\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Rectification Request, 10 May 2024, p. 2.\n\n6.\n\nOn 1 July 2024, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, stating that, before deciding on the Rectification Request, it would invite the parties to \"confer and seek agreement on limited redactions that avoid the unnecessary disclosure of personal information of individuals who were not involved in the arbitration, neither as Parties not as witnesses\u2026\".\n\n7.\n\nAfter requesting and receiving several extensions from the Tribunal to agree on the redactions to the Award, the parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement on the redactions on 19 July 2024.\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 July 2024, the Tribunal confirmed the parties' agreement on the redactions and informed them that the ICSID Secretariat would proceed to implement them.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 July 2024, ICSID circulated the redacted version of the Award, informing the parties that unless any objections were raised within 3 calendar days, the redacted Award would be published on its website. No objections were received and the Award, as redacted, was posted on ICSID's website as agreed.\n\n10.\n\nSince the request made under Section IV of the Rectification Request has been settled, the Tribunal will now proceed to address Sections I, II, and III.\n\n**II. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nSection I of the Rectification Request details specific typographical errors. Respondent had no comments on Section I of the Rectification Request. The typographical corrections identified by Claimant will be deemed incorporated into the Award.3\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, pp. 1\u20134. Claimant identified typographical errors in the following paragraphs: \u00b6 63 (include \"of\" in the sentence \"Two *of* Campos de Pese's workers\"); \u00b6 93 (change [REDACTED] for [REDACTED] \u00b6 94 (include \"a\" in the sentence \"she conceded in *a* sworn declaration\"); \u00b6\u00b6 125\u2013126 (change [REDACTED] for [REDACTED] \u00b6 153, (change \"form of control\" for \"form*s* of control\").\n\n12.\n\nSections II and III address certain \"mis-citations\" and other clerical errors. Respondent does not oppose Claimant's request to correct these alleged errors as suggested, except for the incorporation of paragraphs 13-18 of Mr. Barrios' witness statement in footnote 6 of paragraph 48 of the Award (Section II, request 5). In addition, Respondent proposed an alternative adjustment to footnote 211 of paragraph 179 (Section II, request 4), and an additional reference in footnote 207 of paragraph 171 for \"completeness\" (Section III, request 3).\n\n13.\n\nHaving reviewed the requests under Sections II and III of the Rectification Request, and absent any objections or comments by Respondent on such requests,4 the Tribunal adopts the following corrections of clerical errors and modifications of citations identified by Claimant in Section II (requests Nos. 1, 2, and 3), and Section III (requests Nos. 1 and 2):\n\ni. **Section II, request 1, concerning paragraph 113, footnote 131 of the Award**:5 Paragraph 113 of the Award merely summarizes Claimant's submission made in paragraphs 48 to 53 of section III.B.1.a. of Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Respondent's Objection to Jurisdiction dated 22 February 2022 (\"**Counter-Memorial**\"). For clarity and completeness, the Tribunal decides that reference to paragraphs 50-51 of the Counter-Memorial shall be included in footnote 131. Since paragraphs 50 and 51 of the Counter-Memorial reiterate the argument made in paragraph 175 of Claimant's Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 5 May 2021 (\"**Memorial**\"), the Tribunal finds no need to reference paragraph 175 of the Memorial in footnote 131 of the Award.\n\nii. **Section II, request 2, concerning paragraph 117, footnote 143 of the Award**:6 Paragraph 117 of the Award merely summarizes Claimant's submission made in paragraphs 91 to 96 of section III.C.1. of the Counter-Memorial, which includes paragraphs 91-92 of the Counter-Memorial. Nevertheless, the Tribunal has no opposition to citing paragraphs 91-93 instead of paragraphs 91-92. Footnote 143 of the Award shall be adjusted accordingly.\n\nParagraph 188 of Claimant's Memorial touches on the issue summarized in paragraph 117 of the Award but in broader terms. Also, paragraph 117 of the Award summarizes Claimant's submissions in response to Respondent's objections to jurisdiction. The additional reference to paragraph 188 of that pleading in footnote 143 of the Award seems unnecessary.\n\niii. **Section II, request 3, concerning paragraph 199, footnote 223 of the Award**:7 Footnote 223 of the Award shall be corrected to cite Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 28 April 2023 (\"**Claimant's Rejoinder**\") at paragraph 20.\n\niv. **Section III, request 1, concerning paragraph 41 of the Award**:8 Paragraph 41 of the Award shall be adjusted to reflect the accurate list of participants at the Hearing.\n\nv. **Section III, request 2, concerning paragraph 170**:9 While no errors have been identified, paragraph 170 of the Award shall be revised as follows to clarify that the document submitted with Claimant's Rejoinder was specifically Mr. Newton's Second Legal Opinion:\n\n\"170. The Tribunal recalls that the \"First Expert Opinion\" of Mr. Newton was submitted with Claimant's Counter-Memorial, and that the \"Second Legal Opinion\" of Mr. Newton was submitted with Claimant's Rejoinder, together with the portions of the trust agreements that Claimant initially claimed were confidential, and therefore, Mr. Mark Forte, the expert of Respondent, was granted during the Hearing the opportunity to present his comments, and conclusions on Mr. Newton's legal expert opinions.\"\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Rectification Request, 10 May 2024, p. 2.\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, p. 4, \u00b6 1.\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, p. 5, \u00b6 2.\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, p. 5, \u00b6 3.\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, p. 7, \u00b6 1.\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, p. 7, \u00b6 2.\n\n14.\n\nWith respect to Claimant's requests that were met with objections or comments from Respondent, the Tribunal notes as follows:\n\ni. **Section II, request 4, concerning the chart in paragraph 179 of the Award**:10 the Tribunal finds no error. The chart in the Award was made based on the information provided by the experts in their reports, and the graphic explanation provided by Mr. Lindley at the Hearing11 when commenting on Mr. Mander's opinion and documents.12 The Award does not suggest that the chart was prepared by Claimant or its experts but that the structure of [REDACTED] reflected in the chart summarizes the information provided by the parties and their experts, Mr. Lindley and Mr. Mander. Notably, Claimant does not object to the information reflected therein. However, in the interest of clarity, the last sentence of paragraph 179 of the Award shall be modified to remove the phrase \"according to Claimant\", and, as Respondent proposes, a reference to Claimant's Rejoinder, Figures 1\u20134, shall be incorporated in footnote 211 of the Award.\n\nii. **Section II, request 5, concerning paragraph 48, footnote 6 of the Award**:13 The Tribunal finds no error and sees no grounds for adjustment. Paragraph 48 of the Award reflects Claimant's position in paragraphs 18 to 20 of its Memorial, which includes the reference to Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez's witness statement. Footnote 6 in paragraph 48 of the Award cites Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez's witness statement for the proposition that \"the company bought the refined sugar back as the raw material required for the production and sale of alcohol\", as does paragraph 20 of Claimant's Memorial, which refers to the company's activities in 2009.14 In addition, as Respondent rightly notes, Mr. Berrios's witness statement refers to information on the company's corporate structure in 2009, which is not the focus of paragraph 48 of the Award. Therefore, no correction is required.\n\niii. **Section III, request 3, concerning paragraph 171 of the Award**:15 This is a clerical error. The word \"redirect\" shall be changed to \"direct\", and Respondent's additional reference to the hearing transcript (\"Transcript Hearing 20 June 2023, 157-174) shall be incorporated in footnote 207 for completeness.\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, p. 6, \u00b6 4.\n\nTranscript Hearing 20 June 2023, 208:17-22-209:1-12, Lindley's presentation: \"This is the Organizational Chart that I mentioned with regard to the [REDACTED] and just to quickly walk you through it, if we start at the bottom on the left hand side, we've got [REDACTED] of which Mr. Pellas was [REDACTED] and there are [REDACTED] again, if we got right hand side, top triangle, another [REDACTED] which is a [REDACTED] and Mr. Pellas was [REDACTED]\n\n*See* Transcript Hearing 20 June 2023, 208:10-16: Lindley's presentation: \"I've reviewed the Expert Opinion dated 27 April 2023 of Henry Mander, including the documents exhibited thereto, the Mander Opinion.

To do this, SER negotiated with Rafael Gonzalez and Henry Arosemena to acquire 50% of the issued shares of four companies that were owned by them: (1) Campos de Pes\u00e9, which focused on agricultural operations; (2) Alcoholes del Istmo S.A. (\"Alcoholes del Istmo\"), which sold alcohol locally; (3) Alcoholes del Istmo Internacional, S.A., which sold alcohol internationally and (4) Consorcio Licorero Nacional, S.A., which sold liquors. 19. The parties created a new corporate structure, with a new Panamanian holding company, called Alcoholes del Istmo Holding Company Inc. (\"ADI Holding\"), to retain the existing four companies as subsidiaries.  \n20. Following this transaction, Messrs. Gonzalez and Arosemena continued to work for Campos de Pes\u00e9 as, respectively, the Industrial Director, President and Legal Representative, and the General Manager. **At the time,** Campos de Pes\u00e9 was predominantly an agricultural business: it planted sugar cane, which it sold to sugar mills, which then refined and sold back to Campos de Pes\u00e9 the raw material required for the production and sale of alcohol\" (emphasis added).\n\nRectification Request, 12 April 2024, p. 7, \u00b6 3.\n\n**III. Decision**\n-----------------\n\n15.\n\nFor the reasons set out in the previous section, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) Accepts the rectification requests set forth therein and orders their incorporation into the Award;\n\n(ii) Denies all other rectification requests;\n\n(iii) Orders each party to bear its own legal costs and expenses related to the Rectification Request;\n\n(iv) Orders that the fees and expenses of the Tribunal members, as well as the administrative costs of ICSID, be paid equally by the parties.\n\nDate: 12 September 2024"}]}
