Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 19, 2013, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration of the same date from Transglobal Green Energy, LLC and Transglobal Green Panama, S.A. (\"Transglobal\" or \"Claimants\") against the Republic of Panama (\"Respondent\" or \"Panama\") (the \"RFA\").\n\n2.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the RFA, in accordance with Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\") and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute the Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and that the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, President, appointed by agreement of the co-arbitrators; Professor Christoph H. Schreuer, a national of Austria, appointed by Claimants; and Professor Jan Paulsson, a national of France, Sweden and Bahrain, appointed by Respondent.\n\n5.\n\nOn February 19, 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\") notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, the ICSID Secretariat requested an initial advance payment from the Parties of US$400,000 (US$200,000 each party). The Parties were informed that each party should make its payment within 30 days, and in any event at least ten (10) business days before the First Session of the Tribunal is held.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of March 28, 2014, on instructions of the President of the Tribunal, the Parties were informed that if the Parties' advance payments (or at least the share of one of them) were not received by the Centre by April 3, 2014, the First Session scheduled to be held on April 23, 2014, would be canceled. It was also noted that in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation (\"AFR\") 14(3)(d), if the Parties' advance payments were not received in full by April 3, 2014, the Secretary-General would inform both Parties of the default and give an opportunity to either of them to make the required payment. The Parties were further reminded that at any time 15 days after such information was sent by the Secretary-General, she might move that the Tribunal stay the proceeding, if by that the date of such motion any part of the required payment was still outstanding. Further, if the proceeding was stayed for non-payment for a consecutive period in excess of six months, the Secretary-General might, after notice to and as far as possible in consultation with the parties, move that the Tribunal discontinue the proceeding.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of April 2, 2014, Counsel for Claimants informed the Tribunal that its clients were in the process of making arrangements to pay their portion of the advance on cost and that payment would be made as soon as possible and no later than April 13, 2014. It also requested the Tribunal not to cancel the First Session scheduled for April 23, 2014.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of April 3, 2014, Respondent requested the Tribunal to postpone the First Session; to suspend the proceedings until Claimants made their first advance payment; and reserved the right to seek security for costs, cost shifting of deposits and any other relief as appropriate. Claimants responded by letter of the same date, reiterating their intent to make their payment as soon as possible and no later than April 13, 2014, and once again requested the Tribunal not to cancel the First Session.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of April 4, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that in accordance with its directions of March 28, 2014, the First Session had been canceled. The Tribunal further noted that as soon as the Parties paid their advances, the Tribunal would propose the earliest possible dates for which the three Members were available for the First Session.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of April 14, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal, noting that to that date neither party's share of the advance payment had been received by the Centre, informed the Parties of the default, and in accordance with ICSID AFR 14(3)(d), invited either party to pay the outstanding amount of US$400,000 within 15 days (i.e., by April 29, 2014).\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of May 5, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that, since the outstanding advance payments had not been received, the Secretary-General was moving the Tribunal to stay the proceeding for lack of payment. As a result, by letter of May 6, 2014, the Tribunal stayed the proceeding for lack of payment pursuant to ICSID AFR 14(3)(d).\n\n13.\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Claimants' payment of US$200,000 had been received on November 5, 2014.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Tribunal took note of Claimants' payment, and informed the Parties that the proceeding was resumed. Respondent was invited to inform the Tribunal by November 13, 2013 of the steps taken to make its share of the advance payment, and to indicate the estimated date on which the Secretariat would receive such payment. The Parties were further invited to confirm by November 20, 2014, whether their Joint Report on the First Session Agenda items, submitted by Claimants on April 1, 2014, still reflected their agreement.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of November 13, 2014, Respondent ratified its concern that Claimants might not possess \"the financial wherewithal to commence the arbitration and continue to its conclusion - much less to satisfy any eventual award of costs against them\", requested the Tribunal to issue an order shifting the responsibility for all future advance costs payments to Claimants, after giving both Parties the opportunity to present argument on this issue in writing and orally at the First Session. Respondent further indicated that it would \"refrain from making payment of its half of the advance deposit until the Tribunal has heard the Parties and had an opportunity to rule.\n\n16.\n\nOn November 14, 2014, the Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent's letter of November 13, 2014, by November 18, 2014. This deadline was extended, at Claimants' request, until November 25, 2014.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of November 25, 2014, Claimants objected to Respondent's request that Claimants be forced to fund the entire arbitration, arguing that such request was \"part of an overall strategy designed to make this arbitration as expensive as possible and thereby frustrate Claimants' access to justice.\" Claimants further requested that the Tribunal order Respondent to pay its portion of the outstanding advance.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of November 26, 2014, Respondent responded to Claimants' letter of November 25, 2014, and reiterated its request for the Tribunal to issue and order shifting the responsibility for all advance costs payments to Claimants, without prejudice to a final decision of the Tribunal as to the allocation of costs. Respondent further confirmed that it would continue refraining from paying its outstanding share of the requested advance until the Tribunal has ruled on this issue.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of November 27, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that Respondent's share of the first advance payment request had not been received; informed the Parties of the default; and invited either of them to pay the outstanding amount of US$200,000 within 15 days (i.e., by December 12, 2014).\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties' recent correspondence concerning Respondent's intention to request the Tribunal to shift the responsibility for all future advance costs to Claimants (Respondent's letters of November 13 and 26, 2014, and Claimants' letter of November 25, 2014), fixed a procedural calendar for the Parties' written submissions; and informed the Parties that they would further be given the opportunity for oral arguments on this matter during the First Session, if they so wished. On December 4, 2014, the Tribunal approved a revised schedule for the Parties' written submissions, as agreed by the Parties.\n\n21.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, on December 11, 2014, Respondent filed a written submission reaffirming its request for the Tribunal to shift the responsibility for all future advance costs payments to Claimants, without prejudice to a final decision of the Tribunal as to the allocation of costs; and on December 18, 2014, Claimants filed their written submission in response, requesting the Tribunal to reject Respondent's cost-shifting request and to order Respondent to pay its portion of the initial advance on costs.\n\n22.\n\nLate on February 18, 2015, Respondent filed preliminary objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n23.\n\nOn February 19, 2015, the Tribunal held a First Session, with the President participating in-person with the Parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., and Professor Christoph Schreuer and Professor Jan Paulsson participating by video conference.\n\n24.\n\nDuring the First Session, as previously agreed, the Tribunal heard oral arguments from each of the Parties on the cost-shifting request.\n\n**II. Summary of the Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***A. Respondent***\n-------------------\n\n25.\n\nRespondent has requested that Claimants be ordered to pay the entirety of the interim advances on account of ICSID administrative fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the arbitrators (the \"Request\")1. In support of the Request, Respondent has argued (a) that in case of default of a party in paying its share of an advance request ICSID AFR 14(3)(d) includes a mandatory cost shifting mechanism; (b) that the standard applicable is one of \"good cause\" to be distinguished from the more stringent standard of \"exceptional circumstances\" applicable to requests for provisional measures; and (c) that Claimants abused the process by their prolonged failure to pay their portion of the advance requested by the Centre.2\n\nRespondent's letters of November 13 and November 26, 2014.\n\nRespondent's letter of December 11, 2014, pages 4-7.\n\n26.\n\nAccording to Respondent the following are compelling reasons to order the shift of costs of this proceeding: (a) Claimants have been unwilling or financially unable to comply with advance payment requests on four occasions and only succeeded in paying their portion of the advance; (b) Claimants have made no effort to show their financial wherewithal and have provided documents to Panama confirming their precarious financial position; and (c) Claimants have conceded their lack of resources to prosecute this arbitration by seeking third party funds. Respondent recalls that for the same reasons the *RSM* tribunal shifted payment of advances to claimant.3\n\nId.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent explains that, although it is not requesting that Claimants post security for costs, its request meets the standard applied to requests for security for costs. Indeed, the *RSM* tribunal also found the exceptional circumstances listed in the previous paragraph sufficient to grant security for costs.\n\n28.\n\nRespondent questions the legal merit of the claim because the dispute is a domestic dispute that ICSID cannot and was never meant to address, and because Claimants do not have an investment under the ICSID Convention. Therefore, Claimants have a low likelihood of success.\n\n29.\n\nRespondent requests as relief that \"the Tribunal, pursuant to its authority under Rule 28 and Administrative and Financial regulation 14(3)(d), issue an order shifting the responsibility for all advance costs payments to Claimants, without prejudice to a final decision of the Tribunal as to the allocation of costs.\"4\n\nId. page 12.\n\n***B. Claimants***\n------------------\n\n30.\n\nClaimants argue that \"shifting costs under Rule 28 and Financial Regulation 13(3)(d) for 'good cause' is a more flexible standard, but it is not necessarily less stringent. What constitutes 'good cause' depends on the context. The standard is more flexible because there are other circumstances when cost shifting might be warranted,5 It does not follow that different standards would apply to a request for shifting costs or a request for security for costs when the alleged justifications are the same. According to Claimants, granting one or the other creates tension with two fundamental principles of arbitration: treating the parties equally and fostering access to justice. Therefore, \"whether considered under a 'good cause' standard or a 'provisional measures' standard, the requested order should only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\"6\n\nClaimants' Letter of December 18, 2014, page 1.\n\nId. page 2.\n\n31.\n\nClaimants dispute that their case can be compared to claims pursued by RSM. Claimants argue that Transglobal's history is nothing like RSM's; Transglobal has never had an ICSID proceeding discontinued, failed to pay an ICSID costs award or acquired the notorious reputation of RSM. Claimants recall that \"[e]very payment deadline that ICSID imposed on Transglobal applied equally to Panama and yet Panama also failed to pay.\"7 Claimants explain that \"RSM was exceptional because of three unique findings: a) a history of failing to pay final adverse cost awards in prior ICSID arbitration proceedings and in prior U.S. litigation proceedings, b) an 'admitted lack of financial capacity', and c) an admitted, but undisclosed, third-party funder.\"8\n\nId. page 3.\n\nId. page 3.\n\n32.\n\nClaimants distance themselves from RSM by recounting the alternatives that they have pursued to address Panama's concern and have discussed with Panama but to no avail. Claimants point out that, in the *RSM* case and in contrast to Respondent's conduct in this proceeding, Grenada paid ICSID when RSM failed to pay its advance payments.\n\n33.\n\nClaimants deny that Transglobal has admitted that it lacks the financial capacity to prosecute this arbitration and they confirm that currently Transglobal has no financing from third parties.9 Claimants express the concern that the overall strategy of Respondent is to make this proceeding as expensive as possible and thus frustrate Claimants' access to justice. In this respect, Claimants recall that their financial difficulties are the Respondent's measures alleged in this arbitration in breach of the investment treaty.\n\nDuring the First Session Claimants disclosed that they might have third party financing in the future.\n\n34.\n\nClaimants contend that the jurisdictional arguments advanced by Respondent mischaracterize Claimant's case. Claimants point out the inconsistency in Respondent's argument: it first states that a request such as Respondent's should not prejudice the merits and then argues that \"this Tribunal should grant its current request on the grounds that Transglobal's claims 'manifestly lack merit'.\"10\n\nId. page 5.\n\n35.\n\nAs relief, Claimants request that \"the Tribunal reject Panama's current cost-shifting request and order it to pay its portion of the initial advance on costs.\"11\n\nId. page 6.\n\n**III. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe competence of the Tribunal to vary the portion of the advance payments for the arbitration costs for which each party is responsible under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28 and AFR 14(3)(d) is undisputed by the parties. The matters in dispute concern the meaning of AFR 14(3)(d), the standard applicable to a request for shifting of costs and the circumstances alleged by Respondent to justify such request.\n\n***A. AFR 14(3)(d)***\n---------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe starting point for the analysis of the Tribunal is AFR 14(3)(d), which is reproduced here in relevant part for ease of reference:\n\n*\"(d) in connection with every conciliation proceeding, and in connection with every arbitration proceeding unless a different division is provided for in the Arbitration Rules or is decided by the parties or the Tribunal, each party shall pay one half of each advance or supplemental charge without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of an arbitration proceeding to be made by the Tribunal pursuant to to Article 61(2) of the Convention [...] If the amounts requested are not paid in full within 30 days, then the Secretary-General shall inform both parties of the default and give an opportunity to either of them to make the required payment [\u2026]\"*\n\n38.\n\nRespondent has argued that AFR 14(3)(d) includes a mandatory cost-shifting mechanism in the case of default of a party to pay its half share of an advance payment. The Tribunal disagrees with this reading of AFR 14(3)(d). AFR 14(3)(d) requires each party to pay half of each advance. The terms of the regulation are mandatory: \"each party *shall* pay one half of each advance\". In contrast, when one of the parties defaults, the Secretary-General shall give an opportunity to either of them to make the payment. Here the provision is couched as an opportunity not as a mandate. The opportunity is given to both parties. There is no mandatory cost shifting mechanism from one party to another in AFR 14(3)(d).\n\n***B. The Applicable Standard***\n--------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe parties have argued about the standard to apply to a request for shifting costs as compared to a request for security for costs. Respondent has relied on the Decisions on Saint Lucia's Request for Provisional Measures and Saint Lucia's Request for Security for Costs in the case of *RSM v Saint Lucia*.12 Based on the first of these requests Respondent contends that it is sufficient to show \"'good cause' to alter the presumptive allocation of advance payments\"13, as opposed to the standard of exceptional circumstances applicable to a request for security for costs.\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. Saint Lucia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10).\n\nSee para. 74 of the Decision on Request for Provisional Measures quoted in para. 76 of the Decision on the Request for Security for Costs. Exhibit RA-1 to the Request.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal should first note that the evidence provided by Respondent is limited to the Decision on Saint Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, which includes a quotation of paragraphs 71-74 of the Decision on Saint Lucia's Request for Provisional Measures. On the basis of the evidence before the Tribunal, the Tribunal has difficulty in appreciating the difference in the analysis of the *RSM* tribunal between \"good cause\" in a request for shifting costs and \"exceptional circumstances\" in a request for security for costs; apparently in both instances the *RSM* tribunal based its decision on the same findings.\n\n41.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the standard applicable to the Request is more flexible than in the case of a request for security for costs. As already noted, the Tribunal has discretion under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28 to allocate provisionally between the Parties the portion to be paid of the costs of the arbitration without prejudice to the final decision of the Tribunal on the payment of the cost of the proceeding. In exercising its discretion the Tribunal shall take into account all pertinent circumstances. The Tribunal shall also bear in mind that the Tribunal is requested to alter the balance between the parties set forth in AFR 14(3)(d), and that the only instance in which such balance is altered in the Administrative and Financial Regulations is in the case of an annulment proceeding -an extraordinary remedy- where the applicant is required to advance the entirety of the costs of the proceeding.14\n\nAFR 14(3)(e). This paragraph was only introduced in 1984.\n\n***C. Is the Shifting of Costs to Claimants Justified?***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe first two reasons for cost shifting adduced by Respondent are the delays in Claimants paying their share of the advance as opposed to the full advance payment and the precarious financial position of Claimants. On the first point the Tribunal notes that, as opposed to the case of *RSM v. Saint Lucia,* relied on by Respondent, Claimants have no history of non-payment of costs awards, a fact undisputed by Respondent.\n\n43.\n\nAs regards the financial condition of Claimants, it is a contentious matter between the Parties whether such condition is the result of alleged measures of Respondent subject of this arbitration. It is also disputed whether Claimants have conceded to Respondent that their financial condition is precarious. At this very early stage of the proceeding it would be premature for the Tribunal to make a determination on the financial condition of Claimants and the extent to which it may or may not be the result of Respondent's measures.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent has brought to the Tribunal's attention that it has been faced with a cost order against an insolvent claimant in another ICSID arbitration. While this may explain Panama's reluctance to pay its portion of the advance, the Tribunal cannot consider Respondent's predicament in that arbitration as if it were attributable to conduct of the Claimants.\n\n45.\n\nA further reason advanced by Respondent in support of its Request is funding of Claimants' arbitration costs by an unknown third party. Claimants have explained in their submission that currently they have no third party funding. At the First Session Claimants disclosed that they might have third party funding in the future. The Tribunal takes note of this eventuality.\n\n46.\n\nRespondent has also argued that the claims are frivolous and manifestly without legal merit. It should be obvious that at this stage of the proceeding the Tribunal cannot judge the merits of Claimants' case. The Tribunal notes that, hours before the start of the First Session, Respondent filed an Objection Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5). The Tribunal has invited Claimants' comments and will consider this Objection in due course after receiving them.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal has to balance the circumstances adduced by Respondent in the Request against Claimants' concerns that the shifting of costs at this very early stage may limit Claimants access to ICSID arbitration and create incentives for the defaulting party to make the proceedings unnecessarily expensive. On the whole, the Tribunal finds that the circumstances of the instant case differ substantially from the circumstances relied on by Respondent based on the decisions of the *RSM* tribunal, and do not justify to alter the balance between the parties established in AFR 14(3)(d).\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n48.\n\nFor the above reasons the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. To reject Respondent's request to shift the arbitration costs to Claimants.\n\n2. To order Respondent to pay its portion of the advance payment in the amount of US$200,000 requested by the Centre no later than 20 days after the date of this Decision."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Admissibility of Respondent's Preliminary Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules", "Type": "ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)", "Date": "2015-03-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Admissibility of Respondent's Preliminary Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nLate on February 18, 2015 and just a few hours before the start of the First Session of the Tribunal on February 19, Respondent filed \"Panama's Objection pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)\" (the \"Objection\"). The parties exchanged preliminary comments on the timing of the Objection. The Tribunal invited Claimants' observations on the Objection on February 20, 2015 and Claimants filed their observations on February 24, 2015. At the invitation of the Tribunal and in response to Claimants' observations, Respondent commented on February 27, 2015.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal invited another round of submissions from Claimants and Respondent; they were received on March 4, 2015 and March 9, 2015, respectively.\n\n**II. The Parties\u2019 Arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nIn their February 24 letter, Claimants seek a preliminary ruling that Respondent's 41(5) submission be dismissed and its contents struck from the record on the ground that it was filed late. Claimants note that Rule 41(5) requires that preliminary objections be raised within 30 days of the date of the constitution of the Tribunal, which February 19, 2014.\n\n4.\n\nAs to the arguments made by Respondent during the First Session in support of the Objection's timeliness, Claimants say that Rule 41(5) requires that a preliminary objection comply with two temporal conditions: it should be received within 30 days of the Tribunal's constitution and be filed before the First Session. They argue first: \"The evident purpose of the second condition is that if a tribunal intends to hold its first session before 30 days following its constitution, a party must file any Preliminary Objection before that session. Any other interpretation of Rule 41(5) would render the '30 day' condition ineffective.\"1\n\nClaimants' letter dated February 24, 2015, p. 2.\n\n5.\n\nSecond, the suspension of the proceeding is not a valid excuse for the late submission of the Objection since the deadline for filing the Objection expired more than five weeks earlier.\n\n6.\n\nThird, there is no support in Rule 41(5) for Respondent's contention that it did not need to file its Objection until it paid the initial advance on costs. Claimants' assert that Respondent may not toll the time limits set forth in the Rules by refusing to pay their initial advance on costs.\n\n7.\n\nClaimants conclude by stating that it would be more appropriate to address Respondent's Objection at the time discussed and foreseen in Draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n8.\n\nIn its letter of February 27, 2015, Respondent disputes Claimants' understanding of Rule 41(5). According to Respondent, Claimants read the phrase \"at the earlier of' into the Rule and ignore the purpose and intent of Rule 41(5). Respondent argues that Rule 41(5) fits well with Rule 41(2), which authorizes the Tribunal at any stage of the proceedings and at its own initiative to consider whether the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre. Respondent refers to Professor Schreuer's explanation that \"This authority is designed to avoid awards that exceed the tribunal's powers... if the parties fail to make jurisdictional objections *or file these outside time limits.\"2*\n\nQuoted in p. 4, emphasis added by Respondent.\n\n9.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Rule 41(5) provides the most economical and efficient procedure for disposing of or narrowing Claimants' case. Respondent fails to understand why Claimants would not be amenable to a procedure that will save them costs since Panama has the right to file objections to jurisdiction under rule 41(1) and plans to do so if the Tribunal deems the Objection untimely.\n\n10.\n\nRespondent further argues that the Tribunal has discretion under Rule 26 to extend deadlines in special circumstances. Respondent adduces as special circumstance the financial frailty of Claimants and the thinness of their case. Respondent pleads that \"the balance of harm or injury should the Tribunal decline to address the 41(5) Objection on timeliness grounds would be against Panama, which would be forced to defend against claims manifestly lacking a legal basis.\"3\n\nId. p. 7\n\n11.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants' request is futile because Claimants recognize that they will ultimately need to address Respondent's objections; in fact, if the Tribunal would grant Claimants' petition, it would only force Respondent to resubmit its objections and increase costs.\n\n12.\n\nRespondent concludes by petitioning that the Tribunal dismiss Claimants' requests or in the alternative that \"the Tribunal treat Panama's Rule 41(5) submission as its preliminary notice of jurisdictional objections and its request for bifurcation of these proceedings, without prejudice to any further jurisdictional objections Panama may, in accordance with Rule 41(1), raise after Claimants file their Memorial. \"4\n\nId. p. 10.\n\n13.\n\nIn their letter of March 4 2015, Claimants reiterate that the expression \"and in any event\" between the two temporal conditions of Rule 41(5) requires compliance with both. In fact, the word \"and\" by itself would be sufficient, \"'in any event' immediately after 'and' reinforces the point.\"5 Furthermore, they say, the \"intent-and-purpose\" arguments of Respondent do not support its interpretation of Rule 41(5).\n\nClaimants' letter of March 4, 2015, p. 2.\n\n14.\n\nClaimants point out that Respondent has provided no explanation as to why it failed to comply with the 30-day deadline. Claimants invoke Draft Procedural Order No. 1 and take the view that it defined an efficient process to deal with the jurisdictional issues. Claimants also point out that Respondent \"failed to cite any authority where an ICSID tribunal allowed a belated 41(5) submission over the claimants' objections.\"6\n\nId. p. 3.\n\n15.\n\nClaimants argue that through the \"thinness\" argument Respondent in effect invites the Tribunal to breach due process, prejudice the merits and decide that Claimants' claims are \"thin\". Against the efficiency argument, Claimants argue that, if under Rule 41(5) the Tribunal would decide that the objections of Respondent are manifestly lacking in merit, then this finding would be without prejudice to the same objections being raised by Respondent as jurisdictional and merits arguments.\n\n16.\n\nAccording to Claimants, it would not be wasteful for the Tribunal to address Respondent's objections under Rule 41(5) during the jurisdictional phase because Respondent and the Tribunal would by then benefit from Claimants' Merits Memorial, Respondent may bring all jurisdictional objections at one point in the process, and the Tribunal's decision would be dispositive.\n\n17.\n\nClaimants conclude that a bifurcated jurisdictional phase exclusively based on the Request for Arbitration would reach dispositive conclusions before Claimants have not yet presented their full case.\n\n18.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal reject Respondent's Objection, that Respondent's submissions and attached documents be struck from the record, and that the Tribunal proceed to finalize Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n19.\n\nRespondent's letter of 9 March 2015 again disputes Claimants' arguments on the plain meaning of Rule 41(5). Respondent finds support for its position in the rationale of this rule as explained in the Working Paper of the Secretariat *Suggested Changes to the ICSID Rules and Regulations* (the \"Working Paper\"): \"Rule 41(5) was designed so that the Tribunal could ***'at an early stage of the proceeding*** be asked on an expedited basis to dismiss all or part of claim on the merits.'\"7\n\nRespondent's letter of March 9, 2015, p. 3. Emphasis added by Respondent.\n\n20.\n\nRespondent points out that Claimants do not address in a meaningful manner the Tribunal's duty to consider jurisdictional questions at any time of the proceeding and also at its own initiative. According to Respondent, Claimants' approach ignores the purpose of Rule 41(5) \"as a means of testing the merits of claims as presented by the claimants themselves in the respective requests for arbitration, ***before*** the parties have to incur the expense and distraction of trying to flesh out and then defend claims manifestly without legal merit.\"8\n\nId. p. 3. Emphasis in the original\n\n21.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the efficiency issue is one of timing since both parties concede that the Tribunal needs to address the jurisdictional issues raised by Respondent. Furthermore, Claimants' argument is premised on an erroneous understanding of Rule 41(5), namely, that rulings under Rule 41(5) are not dispositive. Respondent explains that the purpose of the rule is to narrow or dispose of the claims at an early stage through the process provided by this rule, and that, if Respondent would prevail in each one of the issues raised by the Objection, the decision of the Tribunal would be dispositive of these issues without prejudice to the merits of the dispute.\n\n22.\n\nTo conclude, Respondent requests that the Tribunal accepts its Rule 41(5) Objection, that it sets out an schedule to resolve it or, in the alternative, that the Tribunal treat the Objection as a preliminary notice of jurisdictional objections and request for bifurcation.\n\n**III. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe arguments of the parties raise three main issues: First, the meaning of the temporal conditions of Rule 41(5) and whether the Objection complies with them. Second, if this is not the case, whether the Tribunal should use its discretion under Rule 41(2) to consider the Objection at its own initiative. Third, if the Tribunal decides that both of these issues in the negative, whether it should then strike the Objection from the record or deem it to be a notification of jurisdictional objections and a request for bifurcation.\n\n***(a) Compliance of the Objection with the Temporal Conditions of Rule 41 (5)***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nFor ease of reference the Tribunal reproduces below the disputed part of Rule 41(5):\n\n\"Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without merit [...].\"\n\n25.\n\nRespondent understands this clause to mean that a party has two options: either to file an objection within the 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal or before the first session of the Tribunal whenever such session will take place. On the other hand, Claimants read this sentence to mean that an objection needs to be filed within 30 days of the constitution of the Tribunal and, in the event that the first session takes place before the 30 days, no later than the first session.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that the two phrases are linked by the conjunctive preposition \"and\". It is used to connect words, phrases, sentences; adding one thing to another without modifying either. Does \"in any event\" when added to \"and\" convert the conjunctive preposition \"and\" in a disjunctive preposition \"or\"? This would be the effect attributed by Respondent to \"in any event\". The Tribunal does not see how the expression \"in any event\" can by its terms convert two cumulative conditions into alternatives. If this had been the intent of the drafters of Rule 41(5), they would plainly have used the more straightforward \"or\".\n\n27.\n\nThe sense of the clause becomes clearer if analyzed in context. The expression \"and in any event\" is part of a sentence that provides for an expedited procedure unless the parties had agreed otherwise. The interpretation alleged by Respondent permits an extension of the time limit in function of the first session, which may take place before 30 days or at a later date within 60 days from the constitution of a tribunal or even later if agreed by the parties. The sense of expediency in that case is lost. For this reason, if there were any doubt as to the plain meaning of the clause, the more expedient of the two options should be chosen.\n\n28.\n\nTurning now to the purpose and intent of the clause, the Respondent's interpretation seems to the Tribunal to be at cross-purposes with the intent of its introduction in the 2006 version of the Arbitration Rules. The purpose of the rule as shown by ICSID's Working Paper on which Respondent relies is precisely to avoid the situation now faced by the Tribunal. Even after discounting the period during which proceedings were suspended, the filing of the Objection on February 18, 2015, hours before the First Session, could hardly be considered \"expedient.\"\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the disputed sentence in Rule 41(5) means that the two temporal conditions are cumulative; a preliminary objection needs to be filed within thirty days from the constitution of the Tribunal *and* before the First Session of the Tribunal.9 The Request met the second condition but not the first.\n\nThis interpretation of Rule 41(5) is confirmed by the doctrine: \"Whereas the filing of an objection to jurisdiction is to be made within the time limit for the filing of the counter-memorial, the summary procedure must be initiated within 30 days of the tribunal's constitution and before its first session.\" Comment on the Summary procedure of Rule 41(5) in C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary.* Second Edition (2010), p. 543.\n\n***(b) Should the Tribunal use its discretion under Rule 41(2)?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nRespondent has recalled that, under Rule 41(2), the Tribunal may at its own initiative consider whether a claim is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nClaimants oppose the notion that the Tribunal should now consider the Objection on grounds of efficiency and due process since the Tribunal does not have at its disposal the Claimants\u2019 full articulation of their claim, but only the Request for Arbitration.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal notes an element of misunderstanding in the arguments made by Claimants. They read the last sentence of Rule 41(5) as if a decision of the Tribunal rejecting the Objection would not be dispositive. This is not the Tribunal's understanding of Rule 41(5). In relevant part it reads as follows: \"The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\" As the Tribunal understands it, a decision pursuant 41(5) rejecting an objection would be dispositive, but would not deprive Respondent of its right to raise objections under Rule 41(1) that are distinct from the objections already decided under Rule 41(5). This understanding is underscored by the purpose of Rule 41(5), which is to expedite the proceeding. To have two bites at the same apple, as Claimants have put it, would not be expedient but wasteful. Having clarified this point, the Tribunal turns to the argument of due process.\n\n33.\n\nRule 41(5) defines the process to be followed when a preliminary objection is made. As pointed out by Respondent, if it were not possible to respect due process because the objections are heard on the basis of a request for arbitration, then there would never be an opportunity to apply Rule 41(5).\n\n34.\n\nThese clarifications notwithstanding, the Tribunal is concerned about the efficiency of the proceeding. Respondent has reserved its right to raise other objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal besides the Objection, as it is entitled to do under Rule 41(1). The question here is not whether a preliminary objection will be addressed, but *when* it will be addressed. The Tribunal is concerned to add at its own initiative a new phase to the proceedings by considering the Objection at this stage when Respondent without any convincing explanation filed it late and intends to resubmit it together with additional objections. Evidently the Tribunal needs to deal with any objection Respondent may raise, and Rule 41(3) gives the Tribunal flexibility10 as to when to consider them. The circumstances in which the Objection has been filed and the procedural opportunities that exist for the Tribunal to consider Respondent's objections at a later stage of the proceeding do not justify the Tribunal's exercise of discretion under Rule 41(2) in the sense suggested by Respondent.\n\nModified in 2006 \"to introduce some flexibility and make the suspension of the proceeding on the merits of the case, on the raising of a preliminary objection to jurisdiction, discretionary for the tribunal.\" Working Paper, p. 8.\n\n***(c) Should the Tribunal strike from the record the Objection or should the Tribunal deem it to be a notification of jurisdictional objections and a request for bifurcation?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nClaimants have requested that the Objection and attached documentation be struck from the record. For its part, Respondent petitions that the Tribunal consider the Objection as a notification of jurisdictional objections and a request for bifurcation.\n\n36.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Tribunal, the proceeding will be most efficient if Respondent and the Tribunal have the benefit of Claimants' full Memorial and the Tribunal has an overview of all Respondent's objections before it decides on any possible bifurcation of the proceedings. As discussed at the First Session, if the Tribunal were to decide to bifurcate the proceeding, it would be inclined to limit pleadings to only one round.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the Objection did not meet one of the conditions under Rule 41(5). Nonetheless it would be of no consequence to strike it from the record since Respondent intends to file the Objection again. Therefore, the Tribunal is prepared to accept the Objection as a notification of jurisdictional objections, without any further procedural consequences until the Respondent either makes supplementary jurisdictional objections or gives notice that no more will be forthcoming; this would exhaust all such objections of Respondent, which are of course to be filed as per Rule 41(1) at the latest on the due date of the Counter-Memorial.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n38.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Tribunal has decided:\n\n1) That the two temporal conditions set forth in Rule 41(5) are cumulative and the Objection does not meet the 30-day limit from the constitution of the Tribunal for filing a preliminary objection under Rule 41(5).\n\n2) To deem the Objection as a provisional notification of jurisdictional objections to be supplemented with any further objections of Respondent as soon as feasible after receipt of Claimants' Memorial on the Merits and no later than the due date of the Counter-Memorial, as required by Rule 41(1).\n\n3) To defer its decision on bifurcation until it has received the Memorial on the Merits and Respondent's jurisdictional objections are complete.\n\n4) To issue Procedural Order No. 1 in accordance with this decision."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2016-01-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------\n\n**Whereas,**\n------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, the Republic of Panama (\"Respondent\" or \"Panama\") filed \"Panama's Jurisdictional Objections and Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \"Memorial on Jurisdiction\")\n\n2.\n\nRespondent requested that the Tribunal \"Bifurcate the proceeding into a jurisdictional phase and suspend the merits of the proceeding in accordance with Rule 41(3)\" (the \"Bifurcation Request\").\n\n3.\n\nRespondent also requested that the Tribunal \"Recommend the Provisional Measures that Panama requested in its Request for Provisional Measures Relating to Security for Costs of 18 December 2015 (the \"Provisional Measures Request\"), filed simultaneously with this Memorial on Jurisdiction\".\n\n4.\n\nOn December 22, 2015, the Tribunal invited Transglobal Green Energy, LLC and Transglobal Green Panama, S.A.

Claimants reject the need for bifurcation for the following reasons: (a) Claimants have already provided in \"the Request for Arbitration and the Memorial on the Merits enough detailed and relevant documentation regarding the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to make a sound case against Panama\"1; and (b) the Bifurcation Request is \"another way Panama is trying to lengthen this arbitration and add a tremendous amount of cost to these proceedings, which would favor Panama\"2.\n\nTransGlobal Green Energy, LLC (\"Transglobal\") and TransGlobal Green Energy de Panama SA (\"Transglobal Panama\") Reject the Need for Bifurcation\", para. 1.\n\n*Id*. para. 2.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal will decide on the Provisional Measures Request separately.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in opposing the need for bifurcation, Claimants have reiterated their position on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as set forth in their Request for Arbitration and Memorial on the Merits.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, on February 18, 2015, Respondent raised preliminary objections under Rule 41(5) and that, on March 17, 2015, the Tribunal dismissed them as out of time in its Decision on the Admissibility of Respondent's Preliminary Objection to the Tribunal under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal further decided:\n\n\"2) To deem the Objection as a provisional notification of jurisdictional objections to be supplemented with any further objections of Respondent as soon as feasible after receipt of Claimants' Memorial on the Merits and no later than the due date of the Counter-Memorial, as required by Rule 41(3).\n\n3) To defer its decision on bifurcation until it has received the Memorial on the Merits and Respondent's jurisdictional objections are complete.\n\n4) To issue Procedural Order No. 1 in accordance with this decision.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn April 9, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 where in relevant part stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal, in principle, contemplates only one round of submissions on jurisdiction, however, upon receipt of Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal will then decide whether a second round of pleadings is needed, and if so, shall fix the dates for their filing.\"\n\n12.\n\nOn August 14, 2015, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits. In the Memorial Claimants address generally ICSID jurisdiction requirements and the objections preliminarily raised by Respondent under Rule 41(5).\n\n13.\n\nUnder Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal shall consider any objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Tribunal and \"shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute\".\n\n14.\n\nArbitration Rule 41(3) provides that,\n\n\"Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits [\u2026]\"\n\n15.\n\nAccording to these provisions, the Tribunal has discretion to decide the jurisdictional objections as a preliminary question and suspend the proceedings on the merits or to join the objections to the merits of the dispute.\n\n16.\n\nThe choice of the Tribunal between deciding the objections to its jurisdiction as a preliminary question or as part of the merits is a matter of judicial economy and depends on how closely objections are linked to the merits of the dispute.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that *prima facie* the objections raised by Respondent are susceptible of decision on the basis of the submissions of the parties on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nFor these reasons, the **Tribunal has decided** :\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, the Republic of Panama (\"Panama\" or \"Respondent\") filed simultaneously \"Panama's Jurisdictional Objections and Memorial on Jurisdiction\" (the \"Memorial on Jurisdiction\") and the \"Request for Provisional Measures relating to Security for Costs\" (the \"Request\").\n\n2.\n\nOn December 22, 2015, the Tribunal invited Transglobal Green Energy, LLC (\"TGGE\" or \"Transglobal\") and Transglobal Green Panama, S.A. (\"Claimants\") to comment on the Request no later than January 6, 2016.\n\n3.\n\nOn January 4, 2016, Claimants requested the Tribunal \"how much time [it] may have to respond to these issues in an organized and appropriate manner\".\n\n4.\n\nOn January 6, 2016, the Tribunal extended the time limit for Claimants to reply until January 13, 2016.\n\n5.\n\nOn January 13, 2013, Claimants replied and opposed the Request (the \"Response\").\n\n**II. Respondent's Arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nRespondent recalls that the Tribunal denied its previous request for shifting the costs of this arbitration1 on the basis of the limited nature of the record before the Tribunal at that time. Respondent argues that, now that the Tribunal has received the Memorial on the Merits, it is in a better position to evaluate the Claimants' financial condition and the weakness of Claimants' case.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Request for Shifting the Costs of the Arbitration, dated March 4, 2015 (\"Decision on Shifting Costs\").\n\n7.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that the standard for recommending provisional measures is high and that few tribunals have required security for costs, but \"[t]he Tribunal should not be so focused on the decisions of other tribunals facing circumstances distinct from this one that it loses sight of the particular facts and circumstances before it.\"2\n\nRequest, para. 5.\n\n8.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the evidence before the Tribunal confirms that Claimants never owned or held a qualifying investment, lack any meaningful assets, their financial situation is not in any way attributable to Panama, and have not been able to replace counsel or secure third party funding.\n\n9.\n\nRespondent complains that Claimants prosecute their case in an abusive manner by not providing English translations of some exhibits as mandated in Procedural Order No. 1, and the translations provided are slanted in Claimants' favor. Respondent further notes that the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits is not accompanied by any witness statement or report on *quantum* by an independent expert. According to Respondent, \"This chaotic style of litigation has greatly increased the cost and burden on Panama to ascertain the essence of Claimants' complaints, and to address them appropriately\"3.\n\n*Id*., para. 8.\n\n10.\n\nRespondent submits that when these facts are considered together they constitute a sufficient basis for the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures for security for costs.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent recalls that Panama was unable to enforce a cost award in the case of *Nations Energy Corp. et al v. Panama* and states that if it were \"left without the ability to collect an award of costs and legal fees from a financially irresponsible claimant *for the second time*, could force Panama to rethink its participation in the ICSID system generally.\"4\n\n*Id*., para. 13. Emphasis in the original.\n\n12.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal has the authority to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 39 and that the term \"recommend\" in Article 47 of the Convention is functionally equivalent to \"order\". Respondent further argues that provisional measures may be granted even if parties contest the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Request meets the requirements for provisional measures: there is a legal right to be preserved, and the measures requested are urgent and necessary. Respondent explains that it has the right to claim reimbursement of the costs it incurs in the course of the arbitration, and the measure is urgent because it cannot await the outcome of an award on the merits. Given the funds left in this arbitration account, the \"granting of provisional measures at this juncture would protect Panama against the considerable additional legal costs of a hearing or further written submissions.\"5\n\n*Id*., para. 26.\n\n14.\n\nRespondent further explains that the measures are necessary because the evidence before the Tribunal confirms the lack of funds of Claimants. Transglobal Panama is a special purpose vehicle with no assets, and TGGE is a limited liability corporation the balance sheet of which states: \"To date, the company has been supported financially by its members who have contributed all necessary capital and therefore the Company has no debt.\"6\n\nQuoted in para. 30 of the Request.\n\n15.\n\nRespondent argues that it \"should not be forced to pursue and pay for post-award litigation to pierce the veil of a financially-challenged limited liability corporation when this Tribunal can protect Panama now with a security for costs order.\"7 It is also Respondent's contention that, \"[o]n balance, Panama runs a far greater risk of suffering potential harm in the absence of provisional measures than do Claimants in the event the Tribunal recommends security for costs.\"8\n\nRequest, para. 30.\n\n*Id*., para. 31.\n\n16.\n\nAs relief, Respondent requests that the Tribunal order Claimants to:\n\n\"a) Post a bond, payable to the order of the Republic of Panama, in the amount of US$2,500,000 issued by a creditworthy bank or insurance company in the Republic of Panama or in the United States to cover an award of costs, legal fees and/or expenses of Respondent; and that\n\nb) it renew such a bond as necessary so that it be effective from the date of the Tribunal's decision on the request for Provisional Measures, until drawn by Respondents [ *sic* ], or until Claimants pay to Panama any arbitral costs, legal fees and/or expenses awarded to Respondent in this case.\"9\n\n*Id.*, para. 32.\n\n17.\n\nIn a footnote to the amount of the bond, Respondent explains that \"Panama offers this figure as a good faith estimate of the procedural costs and legal fees that it expects it will accrue as part of defending this case. This sum may require periodic increases depending on developments in the proceeding.\"\n\n**III. Claimants' Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n18.\n\nClaimants recall that ICSID tribunals have held that security for costs requests should be granted only in exceptional circumstances. According to Claimants, it is not unusual for tribunals to be faced with claimants who are corporate investment vehicles with few assets created for the purpose of the investment. Furthermore, if security for costs would be granted every time there is the risk of an unpaid costs award, access to justice might frustrated notwithstanding potentially meritorious claims.\n\n19.\n\nClaimants distinguish themselves from RSM and the exceptional circumstances on which the *RSM* tribunal justified to grant the request for security for costs, namely, a history of unpaid adverse costs awards, admitted lack of financial capacity, and admitted but undisclosed third-party funder.\n\n20.\n\nClaimants argue that none of these circumstances are applicable to them. Claimants affirm that Transglobal has never had an ICSID proceeding discontinued or failed to pay an ICSID costs award. Claimants point out that their failure to pay their share of the initial advance payment is mirrored by Panama's own failure to pay by the deadline set by the Tribunal.\n\n21.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Transglobal has not admitted that it lacks the financial capacity to prosecute this arbitration or satisfy an adverse costs award. Claimants explain that they are project companies and \"[t]heir owners contribute capital and the subsequent investments are reflected as losses on a balance sheet until the project is successfully developed.\"10 Claimants further explain that, when in late 2011 Transglobal presented its balance sheet to ASEP11, Transglobal demonstrated that it could arrange the financing that it needed to acquire the power plant that Ideal had developed and ASEP never disputed it.\n\nResponse, para. 13.\n\nThe National Public Services Authority of Panama.\n\n22.\n\nClaimants confirm that they do not currently have third party funding and conclude by affirming their opposition to the Request.\n\n**IV. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n*1. The Legal Framework*\n------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe authority of the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures is based on Article 47 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 39(1), which are reproduced here for ease of reference. Article 47 provides:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n24.\n\nArbitration Rule 39(1) reads as follows:\n\n\"At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\"\n\n25.\n\nBased on a long line of decisions of ICSID tribunals starting with the *Maffezini* tribunal12, Respondent has argued that the term \"to recommend\" provisional measures in Article 47 is the functional equivalent of \"to order\" and, hence, provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal are binding. Claimants have not disputed this interpretation. The Tribunal will limit itself to add that the Spanish version of the Arbitration Rules uses the verb \"dictar\", a term equivalent \"to order\": \"[...] y las circunstancias que hacen necesario el *dictado* de tales medidas.\" Furthermore, the measure requested by Respondent is related to the allocation of costs of the proceeding; the Tribunal has authority to mandate cost allocation under Article 61(2) of the Convention.\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Procedural Order No. 2 on Provisional Measures dated October 28, 1999, para. 9 (\"*Maffezini* Procedural Order \").\n\n*2. The Jurisdiction of the Tribunal*\n-------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nRespondent has argued that the Tribunal's authority to recommend provisional measures is unaffected by objections to its jurisdiction. Claimants have not contested this authority. The Tribunal is satisfied that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction to recommend provisional measures the urgency and need of which may require a decision before the Tribunal decides on objections to its jurisdiction. Arbitration Rule 39(2) mandates the Tribunal to give priority to the consideration of a provisional measures request. Furthermore, ICSID tribunals have consistently held that they have jurisdiction to decide on provisional measures in such circumstances since *Holiday Inns and Others v. Morocco13*, the first ICSID case.\n\n*Holiday Inns S.A. and others v. Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1), Decision of July 2, 1972, P. Lalive, \"The First \"World Bank\" Arbitration - Some Legal Problems\", *B.Y.I.L.,* 1980, p. 123 at, p. 136.\n\n*3. Requirements of a Request for Provisional Measures*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAs provided by Article 47 of the Convention, a request for provisional measures must concern the rights to be preserved, include the measures to be taken by the Tribunal and explain the circumstances that require them.\n\n28.\n\nRespondent has argued that the rights to be preserved include substantive rights -the rights in dispute- and procedural rights. Tribunals differ on whether Article 47 covers only \"the rights in dispute\"14 or may be read to include \"rights relating to the dispute.\"15 The Tribunal concurs in that a wider reading of the parties' rights is justified in light of the unspecified nature of the rights to be preserved in Article 47. Procedural rights may include the right to the *status quo*, the right to the non-aggravation of the dispute and the right not to prejudice the execution of the award.16\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Provisional Measures dated December 9, 1983, para. 3.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Order dated September 6, 2005, para. 40.\n\n*Id*., para. 38. See also *Burlington Resources, Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal de Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Procedural Order No. 1, paras. 60-62.\n\n29.\n\nArticle 47 of the Convention leaves open the circumstances that may require provisional measures. Tribunals have determined that they must be urgent and necessary. These terms have been understood in the sense that the measures requested are required to preserve the rights, but their need makes it peremptory for the Tribunal to recommend them before the decision on objections to jurisdiction or the award on the merits.\n\n*4. Does the Request meet these requirements?*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the Request meets the requirements of specifying the right to be preserved -the right to claim reimbursement of its arbitration costs- and the measures to be recommended. The issue for the Tribunal is whether the circumstances meet the necessity and urgency requirements inherent to the extraordinary nature of the provisional measures.\n\n31.\n\nIn the Request before the Tribunal the extraordinary quality of the remedy requested is combined with the exceptional nature of the petitioned measure. Indeed, seldom tribunals order a party to provide security for costs and, as a provisional measure, only one instance has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal: the majority decision on provisional measures in the case of *RSM v. Saint Lucia17.*\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. Saint Lucia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10), Decision on Saint Lucia's Request for Security for Costs dated August 13, 2014.\n\n32.\n\nRespondent already brought this decision to the consideration of the Tribunal as part of its arguments in support of the Request for Shifting Costs. In rejecting that request, the Tribunal distinguished the circumstances that prompted the *RSM* tribunal to grant the request from the circumstances in this case. Given the extraordinary nature of provisional measures and that the standard applicable to security for costs is less flexible18, has there been a change in circumstances to justify that the Tribunal grants now the Request?\n\nAs noted by the Tribunal in its Decision on Shifting Costs, \"[b]oth parties agree that the standard applicable to the Request is more flexible than in the case of a request for security for costs\", para. 41.\n\n33.\n\nThe distinction made by the Tribunal in its Decision on Shifting Costs between the circumstances of Claimants and those occurring in the case of RSM continues to be valid. The changes argued by Respondent are related to the availability of funds in the arbitration account to finance a potential cost award against Claimants, and what Respondent has termed the chaotic nature of the litigation conducted by Claimants.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the argument related to how the litigation is conducted by Claimants. Claimants may or may not be assisted by counsel. Assistance by counsel is not a requirement to prosecute a claim before an ICSID tribunal. Admittedly it may facilitate the task of the parties and the Tribunal if competent counsel assists the parties, but the incidences pointed out by Respondent, even if taken together, would not support a finding of exceptional circumstances that in turn would justify an order for security for costs. In this respect, the Tribunal notes the willingness of Claimants to discuss with counsel to Respondent the issues related to documentation set forth in the Request.19\n\nExhibit C-62.\n\n35.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, the record available now to the Tribunal is more substantive than it was at the time of the Decision on Shifting Costs. Claimants have addressed Respondent's objections to jurisdiction in their Memorial on the Merits and now in the Response. However, as requested by Respondent, the Tribunal has decided to bifurcate the proceeding, hence to order security for the estimated costs of the whole proceeding is not justified. Furthermore, as envisioned by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 1, only one round of submissions is contemplated. It follows that the Tribunal will be in a position to decide on the objections to jurisdiction without a significant increase in the proceeding costs. Therefore, the measure requested is of doubtful need and urgency.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal is not oblivious to the concerns of Respondent when faced with claims prosecuted not by the investors who have actually provided the funds, but by corporate entities through which those investors have chosen to channel their investment. At the same time, the Tribunal is mindful of the potential consequences of a decision favorable to granting security for costs on the procedural rights of the Claimants even before the Tribunal decides on its own jurisdiction.\n\n37.\n\nOn balance and given the decision of the Tribunal to bifurcate the proceeding, the Tribunal is of the view that the potential limitation on the procedural rights of Claimants outweighs the relatively minor increase in arbitration costs. If requested, the Tribunal would be willing to reconsider this matter in light of its understanding of the case if the Tribunal in due course upholds jurisdiction.\n\n**V.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama Concerning the Treatment and Protection of Investments, signed on October 27.1982, (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\"), as amended on June 1, 20001, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\"). The dispute relates to a hydro-electric power generation concession in Panama named \"Bajo de Mina\".\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Exhibit C-18, Protocol between the Government of the United States of America and the Govermnent of the Republic of Panama amending the treaty concerning the treatment and protection of investments of October 27, 1982, signed on June 1, 2000. As explained in the Letter of Transmittal from President Clinton to the Senate of September 12, 2000 (included in Exhibit C-18), the Protocol was needed to ensure that investors had access to ICSID arbitration following Panama\u2019s 1996 accession to the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nClaimants are Transglobal Green Energy, LLC, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas, U.S.A., with its seat in Houston (\"TGGE\"), and Transglobal Green Panama, S.A., a company incorporated in Panama, with its seat in Panama City (\"TGGE Panama\".\n\n3.\n\nRespondent is the Republic of Panama and is hereinafter referred to as \"Panama\" or the \"Respondent.\"\n\n4.\n\nClaimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn September 19, 2013, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Transglobal Green Energy, LLC and Transglobal Green Panama, S.A., then represented by King & Spalding LLP, against the Republic of Panama (the \"Request\" or \"RFA\").\n\n6.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and that the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, President, appointed by agreement of the co-arbitrators; Professor Christoph H. Schreuer, a national of Austria, appointed by Claimants; and Professor Jan Paulsson, a national of France, Sweden and Bahrain, appointed by Respondent.\n\n9.\n\nOn February 19, 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\") notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, the ICSID Secretariat requested an initial advance payment from the Parties of US$400,000 (US$200,000 each party).\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of March 28, 2014, on instructions of the President of the Tribunal, the Parties were informed that if the Parties\u2019 advance payments (or at least the share of one of them) were not received by the Centre by April 3, 2014, the First Session scheduled to be held on April 23, 2014, would be canceled.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of April 4, 2014, the Tribunal noted that the Parties\u2019 outstanding advances had not been received by the Centre by the deadline of April 3, 2014, informed the Parties that in accordance with its directions of March 28, 2014, the First Session had been cancelled. The Tribunal further noted that as soon as the Parties paid their advances, the Tribunal would propose the earliest possible dates for which the three Members were available for the First Session.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of April 14, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal noted that to that date neither party\u2019s share of the advance payment had been received by the Centre, informed the Parties of the default, and, in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations (\"ICSID AFR\"), invited either party to pay the outstanding amount of US$400,000 within 15 days *(i.e.,* by April 29, 2014).\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of May 5, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that, since the outstanding advance payments had not been received, the Secretary-General was moving the Tribunal to stay the proceeding for lack of payment. As a result, by letter of May 6, 2014, the Tribunal stayed the proceeding for lack of payment pursuant to ICSID AFR 14(3)(d).\n\n15.\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Claimants\u2019 payment of US$200,000 had been received on November 5, 2014, and the proceeding was resumed.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of November 13, 2014, Respondent expressed its concern that Claimants might not possess \"the financial wherewithal to commence the arbitration and continue to its conclusion - much less to satisfy any eventual award of costs against them\" and requested the Tribunal to issue an order shifting the responsibility for all future advance costs payments to Claimants, after giving both Parties the opportunity to present argument on this issue in writing and orally at the First Session. Respondent further indicated that it would \"refrain from making payment of its half of the advance deposit until the Tribunal has heard the Parties and had an opportunity to rule\".\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of November 25, 2014, Claimants objected to Respondent\u2019s request of November 13, 2014, and on November 26, 2014, Respondent responded to Claimants\u2019 letter of November 25, 2014, reiterating its request for the Tribunal to issue an order shifting the responsibility for all advance costs payments to Claimants, without prejudice to a final decision of the Tribunal as to the allocation of costs.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of November 27, 2014, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that Respondent\u2019s share of the first advance payment request had not been received; informed the Parties of the default; and invited either of them to pay the outstanding amount of US$200,000 within 15 days *(i.e.,* by December 12, 2014).\n\n19.\n\nOn December 11, 2014, Respondent filed a written submission reaffirming its request for the Tribunal to shift the responsibility for all future advance costs payments to Claimants, without prejudice to a final decision of the Tribunal as to the allocation of costs (the \"Cost-Shifting Request\"); and on December 18, 2014, Claimants filed their written submission in response, requesting the Tribunal to reject Respondent\u2019s Cost-Shifting Request and to order Respondent to pay its portion of the initial advance on costs.\n\n20.\n\nLate on February 18, 2015, Respondent filed preliminary objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) (\"Panama\u2019s Rule 41(5) Preliminary Objection\").\n\n21.\n\nOn February 19, 2015, the Tribunal held a First Session, with the President participating in-person with the Parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., and Professor Christoph Schreuer and Professor Jan Paulsson participating by video conference. Present at the First Session was the Secretary of the Tribunal. In representation of the Parties were:\n\nAttending on behalf of Claimants\n\nMr. David Weiss, King & Spalding LLP\n\nMr. Enrique Reyes, Transglobal Green Energy, LLC\n\nMr. Jeffrey Carlitz, Transglobal Green Energy, LLC\n\nAttending on behalf of Respondent\n\nMr. Whitney Debevoise, Arnold & Porter LLP Ms. Gaela K. Gehring Flores, Arnold & Porter LLP Mr. Pedro Soto, Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMs. Natalia Giraldo-Carrillo, Arnold & Porter LLP\n\nMs. Laura Castro, Legal Director, Embassy of the Republic of Panama\n\nObserving via video conference on behalf of Claimants\n\nMr. Roberto Aguirre Luzi, King & Spalding LLP\n\nMr. Don Stringham, CFO Transglobal Green Energy, LLC\n\nObserving via video conference on behalf of Respondent\n\nMs. Betzy Castro, Jefa de Gabinete, Viceministerio de Econom\u00eda, Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Finanzas\n\nMr. Roberto Meana, Director Ejecutivo, Autoridad de los Servicios P\u00fablicos Ms. Noemi Tile, Directora Asesor\u00eda Legal, Autoridad de los Servicios P\u00fablicos Mr. Victor Urrutia, Secretario Nacional de Energ\u00eda\n\nMr. Aristides Valdonedo, Gerente de Metas, Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Finanzas Ms. Mariel N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Gerencia de Metas, Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Finanzas\n\n22.\n\nDuring the First Session the Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural languages would be English, and that the place of the proceeding would be Washington, D.C. After considering the Parties\u2019 respective proposals on the number and sequence of pleadings, the Tribunal fixed a procedural calendar for the Parties\u2019 subsequent submissions. The Parties\u2019 agreement and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were recorded in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 of March 17, 2015.\n\n23.\n\nDuring the First Session, the Tribunal also heard oral arguments from each of the Parties on the Respondent\u2019s Cost-Shifting Request.\n\n24.\n\nAfter the Parties\u2019 exchanged preliminary comments on the timing of Panama\u2019s Rule 41(5) Preliminary Objection, the Tribunal invited Claimants\u2019 observations on Panama\u2019s Rule 41(5) Preliminary Objection on February 20, 2015 Claimants submitted them on February 24, 2015. At the invitation of the Tribunal, Respondent commented on those observations on February 27, 2015. The Tribunal authorized another round of submissions from Claimants and Respondent; they materialized on March 4, 2015 and March 9, 2015, respectively.\n\n25.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the Tribunal issued its *Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Shifting the Cost of the Arbitration.* In its Decision, the Tribunal first noted that the competence of the Tribunal to vary the portion of the advance payments for the arbitration costs for which each party is responsible under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28 and AFR 14(3)(d) was undisputed by the Parties. The Tribunal then addressed the matters in dispute before the Tribunal: (i) the meaning of ICSID AFR 14(3)(d); (ii) the standard applicable to a request for shifting of costs; and (iii) the circumstances alleged by Respondent to justify such a request. As to the latter, the Tribunal observed that it had to balance the circumstances adduced by Respondent in its Cost-Shifting Request against Claimants\u2019 concerns that the shifting of costs at this very early stage may limit Claimants access to ICSID arbitration and create incentives for the defaulting party to make the proceedings unnecessarily expensive. The Tribunal found that the circumstances of the instant case differed substantially from those that faced the *RSM* tribunal2, and did not justify an alteration of the balance struck between the Parties in AFR 14(3)(d). As a result, the Tribunal decided (i) to reject Respondent\u2019s request that the arbitration costs be shifted to Claimants; and (ii) to order Respondent to pay its portion of the advance payment in the amount of US$200,000 requested by the Centre no later than 20 days after the date of that Decision.\n\n*RSM Production Corporation* v. *Saint Lucia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on Security for Costs, August 13, 2014 (RL-001).\n\n26.\n\nOn March 17, 2015, the Tribunal issued its *Decision on the Admissibility of Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules* (the \"Tribunal\u2019s Rule 41(5) Decision\"). The Tribunal addressed the three main issues arising from the Parties\u2019 arguments: (i) the meaning of the temporal conditions of Rule 41(5) and whether the Preliminary Objection complies with them; (ii) if this was not the case, whether the Tribunal should use its discretion under Rule 41(2) to consider the Preliminary Objection at its own initiative; and (iii) if the Tribunal decided both of these issues in the negative, whether it should then strike the Preliminary Objection from the record or deem it to be a notification of jurisdictional objections and a request for bifurcation. The Tribunal decided: (i) that the two temporal conditions set forth in Rule 41(5), namely, that a preliminary objection needs to be filed within thirty days from the constitution of the Tribunal and before the First Session of the Tribunal, are cumulative and the Preliminary Objection did not meet the 30-day limit from the constitution of the Tribunal established under Rule 41(5); (ii) to deem the Preliminary Objection as a provisional notification of jurisdictional objections to be supplemented by Respondent with any further objections as soon as feasible after receipt of Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits and no later than the due date of the Counter-Memorial, as required by Rule 41(1); (iii) to defer its decision on bifurcation until receipt of the Memorial on the Merits and Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections; and (iv) to issue Procedural Order No. 1 in accordance with this decision.\n\n27.\n\nOn March 17, 2015, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of March 25, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of a wire transfer from Respondent in the amount of US$ 200,000, as payment of its share of the first advance originally requested in the Secretariat letter to the Parties of February 20, 2014.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of May 11, 2015, Claimants asked the Tribunal to suspend this arbitration or, in the alternative, to grant Claimants an extension to file their Memorial on the Merits of at least 60 days beyond its deadline (120 days from the date of the Tribunal\u2019s Rule 41(5) Decision). At the invitation of the Tribunal to respond, Respondent opposed the request on May 15, 2015. By letter of May 18, 2015, the Tribunal, after considering the Parties\u2019 positions, and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, decided to deny Claimants\u2019 suspension request because Respondent opposed it and none of the instances that would permit the suspension of the proceeding under the ICSID Arbitration Rules apply to the current situation. The Tribunal, also denied Claimants\u2019 request for an extension of the time limit to submit their Memorial on the Merits, since the deadline was two months away.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of May 22, 2015, Mr. Roberto Aguirre Luzi of the law firm of King & Spalding advised the Tribunal and Claimants of King & Spalding\u2019s withdrawal as counsel for Claimants in this case, and that any future correspondence should be forwarded to TGGE\u2019s Managing Partner, Mr. Jeffery Carlitz.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter of June 1, 2015, Mr. Carlitz, on behalf of Claimants, after referring to King & Spalding\u2019s letter of May 22, 2015, informed the Tribunal that they were seeking new counsel to represent them. By letter of June 1, 2015, Respondent commented on this development.\n\n32.\n\nBy communication of June 3, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties (i) that it had taken note of Claimants\u2019 communication of June 1, 2015 regarding counsel; (ii) that the procedural timetable remained unaltered; and (iii) that, as a consequence, Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits was due on July 15, 2015.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of July 1, 2015, Claimants requested a 30-day extension of the deadline for the filing of their Memorial on the Merits. This was followed by observations from Respondent of July 7, 2015, and a response from Claimants of July 8, 2015.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter of July 8, 2015, the Tribunal (i) granted the extension requested by Claimants for filing their Memorial on the Merits by August 14, 2015; (ii) adjusted the deadline for Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, which at Respondent\u2019s request would then be due by December 18, 2015; and (iii) invited Claimants to confirm their counsel and to provide their contact details to opposing counsel by July 10, 2015.\n\n35.\n\nOn August 14, 2015, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits.\n\n36.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, Respondent filed the Memorial on Jurisdiction, a Request for Bifurcation, and a Request for Provisional Measures related to Security for Costs. Given the holiday period, the Tribunal invited Claimants\u2019 comments by January 6, 2016.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter of January 4, 2016, Claimants requested additional time to submit their responses to Respondent\u2019s Requests for Bifurcation and for Provisional Measures related to Security for Costs. On January 5, 2016, the Tribunal extended the deadline of January 6th by one week, to January 13, 2016.\n\n38.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, Claimants filed their response to Respondent\u2019s Requests for (i) Bifurcation and (ii) Provisional Measures related to Security for Costs of December 18, 2015.\n\n39.\n\nOn January 21, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, concerning Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation. In its Order the Tribunal decided:\n\n\"1. To determine the jurisdictional objections of Respondent as a preliminary question and, hence, to suspend the proceedings on the merits.\n\n2. To fix a time limit of 60 days as of the date of this order for Claimants to file their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction to the extent Claimants wish to supplement their submissions on jurisdiction already in the record of the proceeding.\n\n3. To confirm that, as provided in Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal will decide whether another round of submissions on jurisdiction is warranted after it lias had the opportunity to review Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\"\n\n40.\n\nAlso on January 21, 2016, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures Relating to Security for Costs. In its Decision, the Tribunal, after analysing the requirements of a request for provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39(1), found that although Respondent had specified in its request the right to be preserved (the right to claim reimbursement of its arbitration cost) and the measures to be recommended, \"the measure requested is of doubtful need and urgency\". The Tribunal noted: \"On balance and given the decision of the Tribunal to bifurcate the proceeding, the Tribunal is of the view that the potential limitation on the procedural rights of Claimants outweighs the relatively minor increase in arbitration costs. If requested, the Tribunal would be willing to reconsider this matter in light of its understanding of the case if the Tribunal in due course upholds jurisdiction.\" For the above reasons, the Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n41.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, Claimants requested the suspension of the proceeding (the \"Suspension Request\").\n\n42.\n\nOn March 19, 2016, the Tribunal reminded Claimants that, regardless of the Tribunal\u2019s eventual decision on the Suspension Request and in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2 of January 21, 2016, Claimants had until March 21, 2016 to file their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction to the extent Claimants wished to supplement their submissions on jurisdiction already in the record of the proceeding.\n\n43.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, Claimants re-affirmed their request for suspension and Claimants did not file the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n44.\n\nOn March 23, 2016, Respondent opposed the Suspension Request.\n\n45.\n\nOn March 25, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning Claimants\u2019 Suspension Request. The Tribunal recalled that on occasion of the first suspension request, the Tribunal had informed the Parties that \"[n]o provision of the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules allows for the unilateral suspension of arbitral proceedings.\" The Tribunal decided:\n\n\"a. To deny the Suspension Request.\n\nb. That the Tribunal is ready to decide the Respondent\u2019s objections to its jurisdiction on the basis of the current written record.\n\nc. To invite the Parties to inform the Tribunal by no later titan April 4, 2016 whether they agree to limit the proceeding on jurisdiction to the written phase.\n\nd. If the Parties do not agree to limit the proceeding on jurisdiction to the written phase, to consult with the Parties on potential dates for the hearing on Respondents' objections.\n\ne. To reserve its position on the allocation of costs related to the Suspension Request.\"\n\n46.\n\nBy letters of April 4, 2016, each Party confirmed its agreement to limit the proceeding on jurisdiction to the written phase, without an oral hearing.\n\n47.\n\nOn April 16, 2016, the Tribunal (i) informed the Parties that, in accordance with their agreement, the Tribunal would proceed to decide Respondent\u2019s objections to its jurisdiction on the basis of the written record; and (ii) requested the Parties to file submissions on costs by May 3, 2016. On May 2, 2016, Claimants filed a Statement of Costs, and on May 3, 2016, Respondent filed a Submission on Costs.\n\n48.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, at the invitation of the Tribunal, each Party filed observations on the costs of the other.\n\n49.\n\nOn June 2.2016, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**III. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n----------------------------------\n\n**A. Factual Background**\n-------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn November 7, 2003, the *Ente Regulador de los Servicios P\u00fablicos* (\"ASEP\" in its current acronym) granted by Resolution JD-4324 to La Mina Hydro-Power Corp. (\"La Mina\"), a Panamanian company owned by Mr. Julio C\u00e9sar Lisac, a Panamanian national, a concession to design, build and operate a hydroelectric power plant at Bajo de Mina in Panama (the \"Concession\")3. ASEP and Mr. Lisac in representation of La Mina entered into a 50-year concession contract on May 3, 2005 (the \"Concession Contract\")4. On October 21, 2005, the Office of the Comptroller General of Panama ratified the Concession Contract.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 11. Exhibit 033, Resolution JD-4324 of November 7, 2003 from the *Ente Regulador de Servicios P\u00fablicos.*\n\nExhibit C-l, Contract for the Concession for Hydroelectric Generation Bajo de Mina, May 3, 2015.\n\n51.\n\nThe Concession Contract required that construction of the hydroelectric power plant (the \"Project\") start within twelve months of the date of ratification by the Comptroller (Clause\n\n5.1) and the power plant be completed and commence operations within 24 months (Clause\n\n5.2). The State had the right to terminate the Concession Contract if the concessionaire failed to meet these deadlines (Clauses 26.1 and 26.2).5\n\nExhibit C-l.\n\n52.\n\nOn October 17, 2006, La Mina requested a six-month extension of the deadline to start construction. To grant the extension ASEP required evidence from the lenders that they were willing to finance the Project. La Mina did not provide the evidence requested. On December 20, 2006, ASEP issued Resolution AN No. 490 terminating the Concession Contract because of La Mina\u2019s failure to start construction within twelve months of the Concession Contract ratification6.\n\nExhibit C-3, Resolution AN No. 490-ELEC, December 20, 2006.\n\n53.\n\nOn January 2, 2007, La Mina filed before ASEP a request for reconsideration of Resolution AN No. 490. On January 22, 2007, ASEP issued Resolution AN No. 584 rejecting the request for reconsideration because there were no new elements that would justify revision of Resolution AN No. 490.7\n\nExhibit C-35, Resolution AN No. 584-ELEC, January 22, 2007.\n\n54.\n\nOn March 16, 2007, La Mina filed before the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Panama an appeal for administrative review and a petition for injunctive relief seeking to stay the implementation of Resolution AN No. 490. On November 6, 2007, the Third Chamber rejected the request for injunctive relief.\n\n55.\n\nIn parallel to the administrative review proceedings, ASEP opened a bidding process for the construction and operation of a hydroelectric power plant at Bajo de Mina. On May 10, 2007, ASEP conferred to CICSA (now Ideal Panama S.A. (\"Ideal\")), by Resolution AN No. 812, the exclusive right to obtain all necessary permits to enter into a concession contract with ASEP.\n\n56.\n\nOn March 12, 2008, ASEP granted to Ideal, by Resolution AN No. 1523, the concession rights to the Bajo de Mina hydropower plant. On March 27, 2008, ASEP entered into a concession contract with Ideal for the Bajo de Mina hydropower Project (the \"Ideal Concession Contract\"). The Comptroller General ratified it on April 11, 2008.\n\n57.\n\nOn August 18, 2010, an Order of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court \"recognized and approved a transfer of La Mina\u2019s interest in the litigation to Mr. Lisac.\"8\n\nRFA, para. 16\n\n58.\n\nOn November 11, 2010, the Third Chamber issued its judgment (the \"Third Chamber Judgment\") and declared: i) Resolutions AN No. 490 and AN No. 584 to be incorrect, ii) the Concession Contract to remain in force and any other concession cancelled, and iii) Mr. Lisac to be holder of the *cr\u00e9dito litigioso* (right to bring action) arising from these judicial proceedings.\n\n59.\n\nOn December 17, 2010, TGGE and Mr. Lisac signed the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\")9\n\nExhibit C-48, MOU between TGGE and Mr. Julio C\u00e9sar Lisac.\n\n60.\n\nOn January 5, 2011, ASEP filed a request for clarification of the second holding of the Third Chamber Judgment. On January 12, 2011, the Third Chamber rejected this request.\n\n61.\n\nOn February 14, 2011, ASEP issued a resolution ordering that La Mina be registered in ASEP\u2019s records as a power generating company and as party to the Concession Contract.\n\n62.\n\nSix months later, on August 8, 2011, Mr. Lisac informed ASEP that La Mina had approached Ideal to negotiate the purchase of the land pertaining to the Concession and the improvements built by Ideal.\n\n63.\n\nOn September 30, 2011, TGGE and Mr. Lisac signed the Partnership and Transfer Agreement (\"PTA\").\n\n64.\n\nIncorporation of TGGE Panama on October 6, 2011.\n\n65.\n\nOn October 27, 2011, Mr. Gondola, Mr. Lisac\u2019s counsel, filed a request with ASEP for the execution of the 2010 Judgment, and informed ASEP that Mr. Lisac had assigned his rights to the Concession Contract to TGGE Panama.\n\n66.\n\nOn November 25, 2011, ASEP issued Resolution AN No. 4946 rejecting Mr. Gondola\u2019s request for enforcement of the 2010 Judgment by means of the recognition of the Concession Contract\u2019s assignment to TGGE Panama; ASEP\u2019s approval for the assignment had not been requested by Mr. Lisac as mandated by law and the holder of the Concession continued to be La Mina.\n\n67.\n\nMr. Gondola filed a request for reconsideration of this rejection, which ASEP denied on December 15, 2011 (Resolution AN No. 4995).\n\n68.\n\nOn December 29, 2011, Mr. Lisac sent a communication to ASEP requesting the direct transfer of the Concession to TGGE Panama. Because the documentation attached to the request was incomplete, ASEP requested further documentation on January 26, 2012, including the audited statements of TGGE Panama and evidence that TGGE Panama had the technical and financial capability to develop and operate the Project.\n\n69.\n\nOn January 31, 2012, the Cabinet issued Resolution No. 11 authorizing ASEP to proceed to the *rescate* administrativo of the Concession on grounds of urgent social interest as permitted under Clause 30 of the Concession Contract. To this effect, the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Comptroller General selected three valuation experts. Their subsequent valuation Report concluded that La Mina was not entitled to compensation for the *rescate administrativo* because La Mina\u2019s liabilities to the State were greater than the sums expended.\n\n70.\n\nOn May 1, 2012, the Cabinet authorized ASEP to proceed with the *rescate administrativo* of the Concession. On May 3, 2012, ASEP declared the *rescate administrativo* of the Concession by Resolution AN No. 5296.\n\n71.\n\nOn May 9, 2012, La Mina filed a request for reconsideration seeking revocation of Resolution AN No. 5296. ASEP upheld this resolution absent new evidence to the contrary.\n\n72.\n\nOn June 8, 2012, ASEP restored the concession right of Ideal to the construction and operation of the Project.\n\n73.\n\nOn July 16, 2012, the La Mina power plant began commercial production of electricity.\n\n74.\n\nSince then Mr. Lisac has initiated several judicial proceedings with the objective of recovering the Concession. The Tribunal will describe them in its consideration of the jurisdictional objections.\n\nB. **Respondents\u2019 Objections**\n------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction on five counts: (a) There is no investment under the BIT or the ICSID Convention, (b) Claimants have manipulated the international investment treaty system in order to create an international dispute over a preexisting domestic dispute, (c) Claimants have waived their right to bring a dispute at ICSID, (d) their claim based on the Most-Favored Nation Clause is without merit, and (e) TGGE Panama is a domestically controlled entity.\n\n(1) **Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n------------------------------\n\na. Absence of an Investment\n---------------------------\n\n76.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants have made no investment under the BIT or the ICSID Convention. According to Respondent, Claimants fail to identify how their purported investments meet the jurisdictional requirements of the BIT. Respondent contends that the BIT does not extend to investments not yet made or not yet belonging to the investor. According to Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 activities were pre-investment activities: contacts with ASEP and negotiations with Ideal. These activities at most resulted in an attempt to acquire the rights to the Concession. The purported rights to the Concession of Claimants were in fact nothing more than projections, as shown by the terms of the Partnership and Transfer Agreement (\"PTA\")10 and the Claimants\u2019 own pleadings. The PTA did not effectuate the transfer of Mr. Lisac\u2019s purported concession rights to TGGE Panama; \"it merely constituted an agreement with respect to efforts to be undertaken *in hopes of acquiring* the Concession.\"11\n\nExhibit C-007 and Exhibit R-007 (resubmitted version of C-007 to dispute the English translation submitted by Claimants), Partnership and Transfer or Rights Agreement Entered Into by Julio C\u00e9sar Lisac Jim\u00e9nez and TransGlobal Energy, LLC. [[hereinafter \"PTA\"]\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 156. Emphasis in the original\n\n77.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimants do not own or control the rights to the Concession because it was not possible for Mr. Lisac to have transferred them. First, La Mina and not Mr. Lisac was the holder of the Concession, as recognized by ASEP and Panamanian courts.12 Second, the **cr\u00e9dito litigioso** could not give Mr. Lisac the power to transfer the Concession, only the ability to become the plaintiff party in La Mina\u2019s challenge to Resolution AN No. 490 of ASEP. A **cr\u00e9dito litigioso** is procedural in nature; it is a legal tool to create standing before an adjudicatory body.13 Third, at most, Mr. Lisac had the right to request the transfer of the Concession and, even if it would be assumed that he had the right to request the transfer on his own behalf instead of on behalf of La Mina, he needed the approval of ASEP for the transfer to be effective.14\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 161-163.\n\n*Id.* paras. 164-166.\n\n*Id.* paras. 167-168.\n\n78.\n\nAccording to Respondent, even if Mr. Lisac had the right to the Concession, this right was never vested in Claimants, and Claimants cannot assert claims that they may eventually come to own, but did not own at the time of the relevant State conduct. The PTA provides that the assignee is required to submit documentation to show its financial and technical capability. Respondent opposes the Claimants\u2019 argument to the effect that reference to Law 22 of 2006 was a mistake because it was enacted after the Concession; in fact, the same approval requirement can be found in Law 56 of 1995 applicable to the Concession. Respondent similarly opposes Claimants\u2019 argument that Article 21 of the Concession on liens permitted the transfer and only required the concessionaire to inform ASEP. Respondent explains that Article 21 concerns liens on the assets of the hydroelectric plant and not the Concession itself.15\n\n*Id.* paras. 171-189.\n\n79.\n\nRespondent points out that the PTA itself recognizes the need of approval for the transfer by ASEP and includes five more conditions for the transfer to be effective. Of these conditions only one has certainly been satisfied: the incorporation of TGGE Panama on October 6, 2011. No evidence has been provided as to the fulfillment of the other conditions.16\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 190-193.\n\n80.\n\nRespondent disputes the assertion of Claimants that the PTA by itself constitutes the investment. Respondent explains that a contract is\n\n\"[A] vehicle for the legal rights and property rights contained therein\u2014it does not necessarily represent ownership or control of an investment in the respondent State. As a result, such an agreement between two parties is not of itself an \"investment;\" rather only the rights contained therein may constitute an \"investment\" should they meet the definition of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and the relevant BIT\".17\n\nAccording to Respondent, since the rights subject of the PTA are not themselves \"investments\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or the BIT, it follows that the PTA itself is not an investment.\n\n*Id.* para. 194.\n\n81.\n\nRespondent reviews the various arguments advanced by Claimants to show that their investment qualifies as such under the BIT. Respondent notes that Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits abandons the allegation that their investment consisted of shares in TGGE Panama.18 Respondent moreover refers to the statement of Claimants\u2019 counsel in the First Session that the PTA \"entails claims to money, claims to performance having economic value, and they are associated with a concession regarding a hydroelectric power plant, which is a classic example of an investment.\"19 For Respondent it is not clear to what monies Claimants purport to be entitled. The reference could be to the sum to be paid in consideration for the assignment of the rights under the Concession, but the only potential claims to money arising under the PTA are those that could be asserted by Mr. Lisac against TGGE.20\n\n*Id.* paras. 202-203.\n\n*Id.* quoted in para. 204.\n\n*Id.* para. 204.\n\n82.\n\nRespondent also refers to Claimants\u2019 assertion at the First Session that their investment consists of a contract regarding the right to use natural resources under Article I(d)(vi) of the BIT. Respondent rejects this assertion on the grounds that the PTA was only a private agreement to transfer concession rights once certain conditions had been met, which never happened.21\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 207.\n\n83.\n\nRespondent explains that Claimants have articulated their claims as being appurtenant to the rights to the Concession and the PTA, and not to the Bajo de Mina hydroelectric Project itself. Respondent argues that Claimants have provided no evidence of any contribution to the acquisition of the rights to the Concession, of the duration of such hypothetical or the risks assumed, or how such rights might contribute to Panama\u2019s development.22\n\n*Id.* paras. 225-216.\n\n84.\n\nAs regards the PTA, Respondent argues that it does not meet any objective definition of investment under the ICSID Convention; it is only a vehicle for the rights contained in the contract. Furthermore, the capital commitments of TGGE in the MOU and the PTA are only agreements to make future payments; Claimants have failed to show how these commitments satisfy the criterion of an effective contribution to the host country\u2019s economy. According to Respondent, the ICSID Convention requires an actual investment, not only a planned or attempted investment.\n\nb. Abuse of the International Investment Treaty System\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants have wrongfully attempted to create artificial international jurisdiction over a domestic dispute. Respondent observes the pre-existing elements of Mr. Lisac\u2019s dispute with ASEP and the State, which arose when ASEP issued Resolution AN No. 490 terminating the La Mina Concession Contract: i) the Third Chamber reinstated La Mina as the holder of the Concession in its judgment of November 11, 2010; ii) Mr. Lisac filed a complaint on May 27, 2011, against ASEP's resolution of 14 February 2011, because it failed to cancel any concession of the Bajo de Mina plant granted to a third party and to recognize Mr. Lisac as the holder of the *cr\u00e9dito litigioso',* iii) on August 5, 2011, Mr. Lisac initiated before the Third Chamber an Administrative Action for Damages against ASEP and the State and requested as relief A) damages caused by the failure to execute the November 11, 2010 judgment, B) to declare the State liable, and C) to order the State to compensate for lost profit until ASEP returned the Concession. Then, on September 30, 2011, Mr. Lisac entered into the PTA with TGGE with the stated purpose of \"individually or jointly look for and obtaining mechanisms to enable the execution of the November 11, 2011 Judgment, and enable the partnership to acquire the concession rights, that is, THE PROJECT.\"23 In view of the foregoing, Respondent contends that \"Mr. Lisac's introduction of a foreign investor into the ownership of a domestic project, at a time when the project was already embroiled in a domestic dispute\u2014and for the *stated purpose* of seeking mechanisms to resolve such dispute\u2014unquestionably amounts to an abuse of process on the part of the Claimants. It is therefore incumbent upon the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction over all claims in this arbitration.\"24\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 217-230.\n\n*Id.* para. 231. Emphasis in the original.\n\nc. Waiver of the Right to Bring a Dispute at ICSID\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nRespondent refers to the rule of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention that consent to ICSID arbitration is exclusive to any other remedy. Respondent argues that ICSID tribunals have applied a subject matter test to determine whether this rule has been breached. Respondent points out that in this arbitration Claimants allege breach of the BIT by Panama because of its refusal to enforce the November 11, 2010, Judgment and the expropriation of the Concession as a means to circumvent it. Respondent adduces the numerous instances in which Mr. Lisac individually or jointly with TGGE Panama has tried to enforce this judgment in Panama. Respondent also refers to the fact that Mr. Lisac acts on behalf of TGGE Panama by virtue of the power of attorney conferred upon him by the Articles of Incorporation of that entity. Thus Mr. Lisac is the same party as Claimants when acting on behalf of the partnership.25\n\n*Id.* paras. 232-248.\n\n87.\n\nRespondent concludes that Claimants, in their own capacity or acting through Mr. Lisac have already sought before domestic fora what they are seeking before ICSID and on the same fundamental basis. Therefore, \"Claimants are not permitted to consent to ICSID arbitration, as they have already chosen to take their matter to Panamanian regulatory authorities and various Panamanian courts.\"26\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 248.\n\n88.\n\nFor these reasons, Respondent submits that Claimants are precluded by the fork-in-the-road clause of the BIT from pursuing their claims before ICSID. Respondent notes that some tribunals have narrowly interpreted the term \"dispute\" in fork-in-the-road clauses by requiring an identity of Parties, objects and causes of action of parallel proceedings. Respondent further notes that no tribunal that has applied the triple identity test has found the fork-in-the-road clause to have been triggered, thus depriving this clause of practical significance. Respondent rather argues in favor of applying the \"fundamental basis\" test applied by the tribunals in *Pantechniki* and *H&H Enterprises.* Otherwise the triple identity test would deprive Article VII(3)(a) of the BIT of its practical effect in violation of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The objective of Article VII(3)(a) is \"undermined if Claimants are permitted to bring successive cases that, despite raising somewhat differing causes of action, are co-extensive and share the same \u2018fundamental basis\u2019 or \u2018normative source\u2019\".27 Respondent thus submits that resolution of the domestic proceedings will require a ruling on the legality of the *Rescate Administrativo* of the Concession and the alleged refusal of the State to reinstate the Bajo de Mina Concession in accordance with the Third Chamber Judgment of 2010.28\n\n*Id.* para. 256.\n\n*Id.* para. 259.\n\nd. The Claim based on the Most-Favored-Nation Clause is without Legal Merit\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants have failed to allege facts that, even if proven, could meet the legal threshold of a MNF claim. According to Respondent, Claimants have not demonstrated that they were in a \"like situation\" with Ideal, that Respondent treated Ideal more favorably than Claimants, and that the treatment of Claimants by Respondent is unrelated to a legitimate State interest. For these reasons, Respondent contends that the claim should be dismissed *in limine.29*\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 261-278..\n\ne. TGGE Panama is Domestically Controlled\n-----------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nRespondent contends that, because Mr. Lisac, a Panamanian national, controls TGGE Panama, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all claims in respect of TGGE Panama. Respondent refers to the objective set forth in the Preamble of the BIT to create favorable conditions for investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party. Similarly, one of the key objectives of the ICSID Convention is to facilitate the settlement of disputes between States and foreign investors. Respondent disputes Claimants\u2019 assertion that TGGE Panama is controlled by TGGE simply because the latter owns 70% of the shares and Mr. Lisac owns only the remaining 30%. According to Respondent, Mr. Lisac effectively controls Transglobal Panama with nearly 90% of the voting rights.30\n\n*Id.* paras. 279-295.\n\n91.\n\nRespondent explains that the share distribution alleged by Claimants is contingent on several conditions: i) payment of US$50,000 by TGGE to Mr. Lisac; ii) TGGE Panama must be incorporated; and iii) the Board of Directors, presumably of TGGE Panama, must agree to the issuance of the share certificates. Respondent notes that there is no evidence that the first and third conditions have been met.31\n\n*Id.* paras. 296-298.\n\n92.\n\nRespondent further argues that, even if the share certificates had been distributed according to the terms of the MOU, the effective owner and controller of TGGE Panama is Mr. Lisac and not TGGE. Respondent explains that there are 10,000 shares of TGGE Panama outstanding. Of these shares, 6,650 were to be deposited in a trust, and have no voting rights, as agreed by the Parties to the MOU. They may be released from the Trust only after the raising of US$205,000,000 for the acquisition of the power plant and the payment to Mr. Lisac of US$20,000,000.32 Respondent notes that there is no evidence that these conditions have been satisfied. This means that Mr. Lisac owns 89.55% of the total voting shares -3000 out of 3,350- and TGGE only the remaining 350. Respondent asserts that such a minority stake cannot meet the foreign control test under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.33\n\n*Id.* para. 299.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 300-301.\n\n93.\n\nIn further support of its argument that Mr. Lisac is the real owner of TGGE Panama, Respondent points out that Mr. Lisac has acted on behalf and in representation of TGGE Panama in all TGGE Panama's formal requests before the Panamanian regulators. In addition, the PTA provides that \"Lisac shall carry out all relevant and administrative formalities to \u2014 jointly or individually \u2014 obtain, by virtue of the execution of the 11 November 2010 Decision, the assignment of the Project concession to Transglobal Green Energy de Panama S.A. and the means to implement the Project.\" The PTA also provides that \"all activities approved by the partners of Transglobal Green Energy de Panama S.A. shall be executed by means of the power granted to Lisac.\" This power is granted in the Certificate of Incorporation of TGGE Panama. Respondent concludes that all available evidence indicates that Mr. Lisac owns and controls TGGE Panama.34\n\n*Id.* paras. 302-303.\n\n(2) **Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n94.\n\nAs already noted, Claimants did not avail itself of the opportunity of submitting a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. Claimants\u2019 arguments on jurisdictional objections are thus limited to those presented as part of their Memorial on the Merits where they addressed Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Arbitration Rule 41(5). Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections and Memorial on Jurisdiction did not pursue the objection based on the Annex of the BIT, which according to Respondent excludes investments in energy or hydroelectric power generation. While Claimants addressed this objection in their Memorial on the Merits, the Tribunal does not need to decide it.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Claimants, TGGE made an investment in Panama by signing the investment contract with Mr. Lisac by which the Parties agreed to create a special purpose company, namely TGGE Panama.35 In addition, TGGE agreed in the investment contract to reimburse to Mr. Lisac the funds that he had previously invested and to pay Mr. Lisac funds for, inter alia, obtaining the Concession (Articles 7 and 8 of the MOU).36\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, paras. 24-26.\n\nExhibit C-48, MOU between TGGE and Mr. Julio C\u00e9sar Lisac.\n\n96.\n\nClaimants argue that TGGE Panama made an investment by acquiring the Concession rights by contract with Mr. Lisac. According to Claimants, this is the case irrespective of whether ASEP recognized the assignment to TGGE; Mr. Lisac needed only to inform ASEP of the assignment, which he did. In any case, Claimants contend that the investment made by TGGE exists independently of the approval of the assignment by ASEP.\n\n97.\n\nClaimants affirm that TGGE Panama is majority owned by TGGE because TGGE holds 70% of the shares. As to \"foreign control\" required by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Claimants note that other ICSID tribunals have held that the concept of foreign control is flexible37 or that a tribunal \"may consider any approach based on the administration, voting rights, ownership of shares or any other reasonable theory for the purpose.\"38 Since \"foreign control\" is not defined in the ICSID Convention or the BIT, Claimants argue that foreign control should be interpreted in light of Panamanian law. Claimants refer to Executive Decree No. 22 of June 19, 1998, which defines \"control\" of a power generation or distribution company that holds a concession.39 According to this decree, control is exercised when an individual or an entity owns directly or indirectly more than 50% of the shares, or has the right to appoint the majority of board members, or has the right to veto decisions of the board or of the shareholders, or has the right to appoint, remove or replace the manager, legal representative, president, secretary or treasurer, or has the power by itself or through third parties to bind the company by contract without need for such agreement or contract to be approved by the board or shareholders\u2019 meeting.40 Claimants also refer to Article 50 of Panama's Company Act, which provides that the board of a company shall have absolute control and full management of the affairs of a company.41\n\n*Aguas del Tunari S.A.* v. *Republic of Bolivia.* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, October 21 2005, paras. 280-281 (CL-6).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, para. 108.\n\n*Id.* paras. 110-111. Exhibit CL-7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, para. 111.\n\n*Id.* para. 112.\n\n98.\n\nClaimants recall that the contract between Mr. Lisac and TGGE stipulates that membership of the board is proportional to the percentage of shares of each Party, and that the PTA establishes that the board of TGGE Panama shall have five members, of which three are to be appointed by TGGE and two by Mr. Lisac. Claimants conclude that for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, TGGE Panama is under foreign control.42\n\n*Id.* paras. 114-116.\n\n99.\n\nClaimants assert that TGGE and TGGE Panama have submitted the dispute only to this Tribunal and not to the Panamanian courts; hence, Claimants meet the requirements of Article VII(3) of the BIT.43\n\n*Id.* paras. 154-155.\n\n(3) **Analysis of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal may choose to consider the objections to its jurisdiction in any particular order. The Tribunal will start by considering the objection based on abuse of the international investment treaty system by Claimants' allegedly wrongful attempt to create artificial international jurisdiction over a pre-existing domestic dispute. The Tribunal has chosen to consider this objection first, because the existence of abuse of process is a threshold issue that would bar the exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction even if jurisdiction existed.44\n\nSee *Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador.* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, June 1, 2012, para. 2.10.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that Claimants have ignored the issue of abuse of process altogether. Respondent first raised this issue in its Memorial on Jurisdiction. Thus, Claimants were not aware of it when they filed their Memorial on the Merits and yet they decided not to file a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction even after the Tribunal reminded Claimants that their second suspension request dated March 16, 2016 did not dispense them from having to meet the established deadline for such pleading.45 Instead, in their letter of March 21, 2016, filed within a few days of the due date of the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants, referring to their second suspension request, explained that\n\n\"the purpose of our entry into this arbitration to begin with was to have the Bajo de Mina concession in TGGE's name, we felt it would not be in the best interest for TGGE to expend more money, time or resources in the arbitration at this moment since we believe the ruling will now be executed. Instead we consider that with this recent Supreme Court ruling by the plenum, we should then achieve justice in Panama through the contract we have with our Panamanian Partner. TGGE again requests a suspension of the proceedings from the Tribunal until the Supreme Court Plenary of Panama orders are executed or resolved in Panama. Upon execution we will terminate these proceedings.\"46\n\nTribunal\u2019s letter to Claimants dated March 19, 2016.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter to the Tribunal dated March 21, 2016.\n\n102.\n\nThere is a line of consistent decisions of arbitral tribunals on objections to jurisdiction based on abuse of the investment treaty system. In *Phoenix* the tribunal stated:\n\n\"If it were accepted that the Tribunal lias jurisdiction to decide Phoenix's claim, then any pre-existing national dispute could be brought to an ICSID tribunal by a transfer of the national economic interests to a foreign company in an attempt to seek protections under a BIT. Such transfer from the domestic arena to the international scene would ipso facto constitute a \"protected investment\" - and the jurisdiction of BIT and ICSID tribunals would be virtually unlimited. It is the duty of the Tribunal not to protect such an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs. It is indeed the Tribunal's view that to accept jurisdiction in this case would go against the basic objectives underlying the ICSID Convention as well as those of bilateral investment treaties.\"47\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd* v. *Czech Republic.* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award (April 15, 2009), para. 144 [hereinafter *Phoenix* v. *Czech Republic]* (RL-035).\n\n103.\n\nTo determine whether an abuse of rights has occurred, tribunals have considered all the circumstances of the case48, including, for instance, the timing of the purported investment, the timing of the claim, the substance of the transaction, the true nature of the operation49, and the degree of foreseeability of the governmental action at the time of restructuring.50 For purposes of the analysis of this objection, the Tribunal will consider the timing of the alleged investment, the terms of the transaction in which it was to be effected, and some relevant incidents in the course of this proceeding. In so doing, the Tribunal will *pro tern* assume the validity of Claimants\u2019 factual assertions with respect to the merits.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings B.

In the MOU Mr. Lisac undertook to supply TGGE all the documentation he had related to the Project. TGGE made the commitment to a complete due diligence in respect of all aspects of the Project with the objective of confirming the information previously provided by Mr. Lisac.51\n\nExhibit C-48, MOU, Article 6.\n\n106.\n\nThe PTA was signed on September 30, 2011. During the intervening time, on February 14, 2011, ASEP registered La Mina Hydro-Power Corp, in the books of ASEP as an electric power generating company, because it had concluded with ASEP a Concession Contract for the construction, exploitation and maintenance of the hydroelectric power station known as Bajo de Mina.\n\n107.\n\nSix months later, on August 8, 2011, Mr. Lisac addressed to ASEP a letter on behalf of La Mina in which Mr. Lisac explained that he had approached Ideal in order to purchase directly from it the buildings pertaining to the Concession and to pay for the improvements already made. Mr. Lisac warned ASEP that, if this approach did not succeed, they (Mr. Lisac used the plural) would have recourse to an enforcement action to which they were entitled by law as the concessionaires of La Mina.52\n\nExhibit C-6, Letter to ASEP dated August 8, 2011.\n\n108.\n\nThis was the situation when Mr. Lisac and TGGE signed the PTA on September 30, 2011. The whereas clauses of the PTA recite that: (i) Ideal purchased land and the power plant at its final stage of construction ***(Considerando*** 1.5); (ii) the purpose of the PTA is for TGGE and Mr. Lisac to pay Ideal for the land and the construction *(C onsiderando* 1.5); (iii) the Third Chamber Judgment had been communicated to ASEP but the latter had not complied with it ***(Considerando*** 1.6); (iv) TGGE had undertaken to collaborate through TGGE Panama in the *\"perfeccionamiento\"* of the compliance with the Third Chamber Judgment ***(Considerando*** 7).\n\n109.\n\nThe object of the PTA was for TGGE and Mr. Lisac to establish TGGE Panama in order \"to jointly or individually seek and obtain mechanisms that permit the execution of the Sentence of November 11, 2010 [...]\"53 The first obligation undertaken by TGGE in the PTA was to assist in the compliance with such judgment and in the administrative processes necessary for ASEP to approve TGGE Panama as the Concession holder.54\n\nExhibit C-007 and Exhibit R-007, PTA Clause 1. Translation of the Tribunal.\n\nExhibit C-007 and Exhibit R-007, PTA Clause 2. A).\n\n110.\n\nThe collaboration in the enforcement of the Third Chamber Judgment was a distinctive change from the terms of the MOU. The MOU set forth understandings limited to the execution and commercial operation of the Project, the setting up of a new special purpose company, and payments to be made to Mr. Lisac. The PTA reflected a new reality. By then, according to Claimants, ASEP had failed to comply with the Third Chamber Judgment and its enforcement takes a prominent place in the object of the PTA and the obligations of the Parties.\n\n111.\n\nThe voting arrangements in TGGE Panama and the principle of exclusive execution by Mr. Lisac of acts agreed by the shareholders provided in the PTA revealed Mr. Lisac\u2019s intent to remain in *de facto* control of TGGE Panama irrespective of the percentage of shares held and at the same time to benefit from the foreign nationality of TGGE for the purpose of pursuing this arbitration. Thus the third whereas clause *{Considerando* 3) of the PTA specifies the percentage of shares of each shareholder in TGGE Panama, and then provides in mandatory terms that TGGE Panama shall deposit the share certificates of TGGE with a trustee acceptable to both shareholders.55 Furthermore, as long as the certificates are in deposit, TGGE shall not have the right to vote pertaining to these shares. The same provision records the Parties' understanding that all activities agreed by the shareholders of TGGE Panama shall be carried out by way of the power of attorney granted to Mr. Lisac.\n\nThe Annex to the PTA on *\"Ejecuci\u00f3n Financiera del MOU\"* provides more detail on the distribution of shares of TGGE Panama: 3000 for Mr. Lisac, 350 for TGGE and 6650 for TGGE. These 6650 shares are the shares deposited with a trustee until certain financial conditions are met by TGGE. There is no record in this arbitration that such conditions were ever met.\n\n112.\n\nThe PTA provisions on the distribution of the proceeds of an eventual sale of the power plant or of receipt of compensation reflects the predominant role of Mr. Lisac disproportionate to his shareholding in TGGE Panama. TGGE and Mr. Lisac agreed to change the proportion of the percentages of the proceeds of a sale or of compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled. Mr. Lisac would receive 80% and TGGE 20% of such proceeds. TGGE and Mr. Lisac further agreed that to the extent that compensation would be received, the proceeds should be paid first in the trust constituted as part of the purposes of the PTA, which would forthwith disburse the funds to TGGE and Mr. Lisac in the proportion set forth above.56 It is telling that the proportion to be received by TGGE would not take into account the substantial contribution TGGE undertook to make in the MOU and then in the PTA, and that there is no record of TGGE ever making any contribution other than the US$50,000 paid to Mr. Lisac at the time of the signing of the PTA.\n\nExhibit C-007 and Exhibit R-007, PTA Clause 3, paragraph 2. It will be useful to transcribe the Spanish text of Clause 3.2 summarized above by the Tribunal:  \n*\"2) En el caso que se ofrezca el pago de una indemnizaci\u00f3n o un pago en concepto de venta o cesi\u00f3n, en favor de quien ostente los derechos sobre el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n \"DEL PROYECTO\", se variar\u00e1 la proporci\u00f3n de los porcentajes reconocidos a LOS ASOCIADOS y en ese caso ser\u00e1 reconocida a favor de LISAC el 80% de la suma resultante de tal pago,* y *el porcentaje restante a TRANSGLOBAL, es decir el 20%.*  \n*En este punto, LOS ASOCIADOS acuerdan que en caso de realizarse el pago de una indemnizaci\u00f3n este se har\u00e1 efectivo a favor de un Fideicomiso que LOS ASOCIADOS constituyen como parte de los prop\u00f3sitos de este Contrato. El Fideicomiso inmediatamente tendr\u00e1 la obligaci\u00f3n de desembolsar a favor de LISAC en la proporci\u00f3n de 80%* y *a favor de TRANSGLOBAL en la proporci\u00f3n de 20%..\"*\n\n113.\n\nThe procedural developments related to the pursuit by Mr. Lisac of the execution of the Third Chamber Judgment in Panama prompted Claimants twice to request the suspension of this arbitration. Both suspension requests reveal the intimate relationship of the ongoing court proceedings in Panama and this proceeding, and confirm the intent of Mr. Lisac to internationalize his domestic dispute with Panama. On April 21, 2015, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court ordered the execution of its judgment of November 11, 2010. This prompted Claimants to attempt to justify their application for suspension by reference to Mr. Lisac's request to ASEP\n\n\"to confirm if intend [sic] to comply with this final judgment from Panama's highest court, and made himself available to collaborate in this process and are working with their local partner to make sure the concession is transferred in the most efficient manner.\"\n\nThese developments are at the core of Claimants' treaty claims and affect the preparation of Claimants\u2019 case in this arbitration\".\n\n114.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, TGGE applied for suspension of the arbitration. TGGE explained that\n\n\"The Supreme Court lias once again ordered the execution of its own judgment of 11 November 2010. As this would lead to the fulfillment of the contract between Mr. Lisac and TGGE, and the ability of TGGE to complete its investment, which is why this arbitration was started; TGGE respectfully requests a suspension of these proceedings until the first and most recent orders of the Supreme Court are executed or until the Panamanian state decides, once again, to illegally intervene.\"57\n\nRequest for suspension of March 16, 2016, para. 10.\n\n115.\n\nTGGE concluded:\n\n\"Accordingly, our request for temporary suspension of the arbitral procedure is based on the fact that there should be reasonable time granted to ensure *that the procedures provided for at the national level for the execution of the judgment of the Supreme Court and corresponding contractual rights, both of which have a direct impact on the process and result of this arbitration,* so that both the parties and the tribunal will be able to bring all their actions in this regard should it be necessary. Hopefully, the government of Panama will allow the unfettered execution of the judicial orders of the Supreme Court and *no further action will be necessary in this arbitration,\"58*\n\nId. para. 20. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n116.\n\nIt follows from the preceding that Mr. Lisac inserted TGGE and TGGE Panama into the process of pursuing the execution of the Third Chamber Judgment at a time when it was clear that there was a problem with its implementation. Even if it were accepted that on December 17, 2010, when the MOU was signed, it had seemed likely that the implementation of the sentence would proceed without difficulty, this was not the case at the time of the signing of the PTA on September 30, 2011. By then, Mr. Lisac had threatened ASEP with enforcement action based on the Third Chamber Judgment.\n\n117.\n\nIf the Tribunal considers the administrative and judicial actions initiated by Mr. Lisac in his own name or in the name of La Mina following ASEP\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract on December 20, 2006, the timing of the intervention of TGGE and TGGE Panama into the dispute is even more telling. By that time Mr. Lisac had already pursued the domestic remedies at the Supreme Court level and now sought international remedies with Claimants\u2019 assistance.\n\n118.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Tribunal upholds Respondent\u2019s objection to its jurisdiction on the ground of abuse by Claimants of the investment treaty system by attempting to create artificial international jurisdiction over a pre-existing domestic dispute.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal needs not consider the remaining objections since their success or failure would be indifferent to the decisive consequence flowing from this finding.\n\nIV. **COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal invited the Parties to file submissions on costs. Respondent filed a statement of fees and expenses in the amount of US$2,393,355.05, and a detailed submission in support of its request for a full award of costs and fees, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and compound interest at LIBOR plus two percentage points per annum on the amount awarded. Claimants filed no submission and only provided a statement of fees and expenses in the amount of US$802,587.68.\n\n121.\n\nRespondent has pointed out that, in cases of abuse of the arbitral process, tribunals have found that an award of full costs is particularly appropriate even if Respondent did not prevail on every request it made to the Tribunal. Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 manner of prosecuting this arbitration has unnecessarily complicated Panama\u2019s analysis of the claims, and complains that Claimants failed to provide translations of core documents, submitted discrepant documentary evidence, and filed two suspension requests in the knowledge that Respondent would oppose them.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal gave the Parties the opportunity to comment on each other\u2019s filings. Claimants voiced no objection to Respondent\u2019s expenses and simply noted what it considered the unnecessary length of Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n\n123.\n\nAs regards the statement presented by Claimants, Respondent suggested that, in view of the amount claimed on account of the costs of the First Session (US$626,712.34 out of a total of US$802,587.68), if the Tribunal were inclined to grant such costs, it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to seek further clarification from Claimants regarding their calculation. Furthermore, Respondent has reiterated its request that, in addition of being granted a full cost award, the Tribunal order that \"one hundred percent (100%) of any funds remaining in the administrative account for this case be refunded to Panama as partial credit against a cost award in Panama\u2019s favor.\"59\n\n[...]\n\n**B. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nUnder Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention the Tribunal has discretion to allocate costs between the Parties. In their statements of fees and expenses, as requested by the Tribunal, the Parties have broken down the total amount into categories reflecting the costs related to specific parts of the proceeding.\n\n125.\n\nICSID tribunals have used their discretion to divide the costs of the proceedings equally between the parties or to rule that costs follow the event. There are ample instances of either outcome. In the case of successful jurisdictional objections based on abuse of process, tribunals have tended to decide that claimants should bear the costs of the proceeding. As regards the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses of claimants, the record is mixed. In *Phoenix,* the tribunal found the respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses to be reasonable and decided that claimant should bear them.60 On the other hand, the tribunal in *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy* noted that\n\n\"the Claimants sought to minimize the costs of the proceedings, which is not the case of their opponent, as the disparity of the costs figures shows. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds it fair that the Claimants pay to the Respondent the amount of USD 1,571,858.72, *i.e.,* the sum which they themselves considered necessary to present their case, as a contribution to the Respondent\u2019s fees and expenses.\"61\n\n*Phoenix* v. *Czech Republic,* para. 152 (RL-035).\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy* v. *Peru,* para. 202 (RL-017).\n\n126.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal in a case of abuse of process is that Claimants should bear the costs of the proceeding and attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses of Respondent, provided that the latter are reasonable. This Tribunal, like the tribunal in *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy,* does not believe that a finding of abuse of process precludes an assessment of the proportionality of fees and expenses claimed on both sides. The Tribunal accepts that the fits and starts of Claimants\u2019 pleadings likely increased Respondent\u2019s counsel costs. The Tribunal is also concerned about the cavalier attitude of Claimants as shown by the repeated requests for suspension of the proceeding even though counsel for Respondent had previously advised Claimants that Respondent would oppose the requests. Moreover, although the Tribunal, when rejecting the first suspension request, had called attention to the fact that no provision in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules would permit the Tribunal to suspend the proceeding upon a unilateral request by one party, Claimants nevertheless filed a second suspension request.\n\n127.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s Requests for Shifting the Costs of the Arbitration to Claimants and for Provisional Measures relating to Security for Costs. The Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction under Arbitration Rule 41(5) was clearly out of time and therefore rejected as such by the Tribunal, but the Tribunal nonetheless accepted it as a notice of future jurisdictional objections. After taking all these circumstances into account, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants should bear the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses of Respondent except for those claimed by Respondent for:\n\n(i) the Request for Shifting the Costs of Arbitration to the Claimants (US$98,902.85),\n\n(ii) Timeliness of Preliminary Objections Pursuant to Rule 41(5) (US$74,075.00), and\n\n(iii) Request for Provisional Measures relating to Security for Costs (US$10,844.50)].\n\nGiven the finding of abuse of process, the Tribunal considers that the amount awarded should bear interest compounded annually at LIBOR plus two percentage points per annum.\n\n128.\n\nRespondent's further request that the Tribunal order that the remaining funds in the administrative account for this arbitration be paid to Respondent, as a partial payment of an award of costs, based on the general authority of the Tribunal under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, Arbitration Rules 28 and 47(j), and Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d).\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent has not referred to any instance in which an ICSID tribunal issued such an order, and the Tribunal is not aware of any. Arbitration Rule 28(1) concerns the apportionment of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and Arbitration Rule 28(2) obliges the parties to submit a statement of costs. Arbitration Rule 47(j) is part of the checklist of items to be included in the award. It reads: \"any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\" This cannot possibly mean that the Tribunal may make a decision beyond the authority conferred upon it by the Convention and the Arbitration Rules. Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) concerns the payment of the advances by the Parties. None of these rules empower the Tribunal to order the disposition of funds remaining in the arbitration account as requested by Respondent. The advances made by the Parties have been made for the payment of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges of the Secretariat in the proportion fixed in the request for the advances. Short of an agreement to that effect by the Party that advanced the funds concerned, the Tribunal has no authority to dispose of such funds for another purpose. More importantly, as stated in Article 61(2), the decision of the Tribunal as to the expenses of the Parties and the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal shall be part of the award. In the view of the Tribunal, for it to direct the Secretariat to disburse to Respondent the remaining funds in the arbitration account would be tantamount to ordering the Secretariat to effect a partial execution of the Award. The Tribunal has no authority to issue such an order; nor would the Secretariat have basis for implementing it.\n\nV.\u00a0**DECISION**\n---------------\n\n130.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal has decided:\n\ni) To uphold Respondent\u2019s objection of abuse of process, without needing to consider the other objections to its jurisdiction.\n\nii) To award Respondent (i) the costs of the arbitration, comprising the fees and expenses of the Tribunal members and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses, as determined by ICSID in the final financial statement of this case, and (ii) legal fees and expenses of Respondent in the amount of US$2,209,532.70.\n\niii) That Claimants shall pay post-award interest on the aggregate amount resulting from subparagraph ii) *supra,* at the rate of LIBOR plus two percentage points, compounded annually, calculated from the date of the Award until full payment.\n\niv) To rej ect Respondent\u2019s request for an award of any funds remaining in the administrative account for this case.\n\nv) To dismiss all other requests for relief."}]}
